1,best game ever nothing like it!
2,"I was incredibly hesitant on starting this game when I first got it, I honestly mostly got it cuz my friends bugged the hell out of me to get it.

I was hesitant because I thought it would get boring rather quick, i'd run out of things to do, or just that it wouldn't be my type of game.

I decided to launch it up on Singleplayer and see what the hype is about and I [b] do not regret it one bit. [/b]

Go into this game as blind as possible, but don't be afraid to use the Wiki if you need information.
Also realize you can play this game at ANY pace you want, and that there is no pressure whatsoever to build a massive farm as soon as possible, but you also don't need to cherish every day and you can easily skip days if you don't feel like using them."
3,"its perfect
"
4,"Harvest moon but all the chicks are ugly

"
5,"Stardew is an amazing game. Not only can you just chill out and tend to and grow your farm but you can interact with the towns folk and build relations with them, to the point of marriage, regardless of genders. you can go fishing, mining, fighting even. There's new areas to unlock and interesting characters to meet, there's farming and fighting, and events to attend like a flower dance or a Christmas feast. 10/10 game"
6,!
7,It's good.
8,Das is gud
9,So good
10,"Absolutely Amazing Game, It is so simple and so  well crafted the Npcs Are cool and the farming is soo calming"
11,a lot of bitches
12,i love it
13,You can farm in a valley
14,"i love it! my favorite game of all time. it's comfy, scary, funny and everything else, can't go wrong playing this one"
15,"You already know it's overwhelmingly positive. But I strongly suggest spending more than a couple of minutes reading through the reviews, both positive and negative, and you'll understand what this game is about.

I, just like many others here, found what I needed in this game.

Give it a try!"
16,Lovely little game. No brain cells required for this
17,yes yes my dear boy yes yes
18,i didnt know it would be this good
19,i would sell my first born child to be able to experience this game for the first time again.
20,Beautiful!
21,"This game is really fun and has a ton of content that can last hours, I think this game is the definition of a good indie game"
22,"At last I have all the achievements...
Joja member of the year...

23,"Appeals to male fantasy, now I want to inherit a farm."
24,I blow up my neighbor!
25,All my homies hate Pierre
26,EEEEEEE
27,I go farm I get money I like it
28,This is farming but if it was good.
29,It's very interesting and fun it's also very mysterious I don't really like. How there's no multiplayer that you can play online but you can play with friends anyways it's a great farming game I'll rate it a 5/10
30,"Relaxing and kinda stressful at the same time, I can never get to where I need to be fast enough. Love this game though, my brother said it's like if Minecraft and Animal Crossing had a baby and I completely agree."
31,"SO relaxing! Me and a good friend of mine used to to play for hours on end, and even now I love checking in once in a while, whether to min-max or try some of the many amazing community mods!"
32,Yes.
33,you can make potato
34,great game.
35,yes
36,"So far very enjoyable, I nice way to wind down after work."

45,"After 459 hours of play, I finally got tired and decided to try mods. See you again at 1k hours ig."
46,i like it
47,"Could not recommend this more! This might be the most satisfying game I've ever played. And while Animal Crossing exists, Stardew has so much complexity and charm that nothing comes close to its quality! 100/10"
48,Sebastian
49,Hitman 4
50,love it
51,Very fun 10/10
52,LOVE
53,The base game is amazing up in itself but adding mods adds a whole new layer of depth especially when playing by youself
54,e
55,I've lost 100's of hours of my life to the switch version of this game. The pc version with mods and everything is worth hundreds more
56,super fun and chill to play by yourself or with friends :)
57,"Shane is an alcoholic, and I will use this to force feed him gifts because he's the only one I know the path of."

63,"Play time speaks for itself really, but to be clearer, it's very addictive. It's relaxing but keeps you engaged. You're an office drone/city dweller who moved to the valley on a whim after finally finding out your dear departed granddad left you a farm there. You meet the mayor and local carpenter then are tossed into your first day of farming as a greenhorn idiot with no idea what you're doing.

The whole point of the game is to figure out what you want out of your farm and and the relationships you want your farmer to prioritize. You want to plant crops? Raise coop or barn animals? Fish your worries away? Mine minerals and precious gems in dark caves while fighting off dangerous creatures? All of the above? Something completely different? Change your mind mid play through to scrap the farm and start something new? You want to marry a wannabe rocker, football player, doctor, teacher, photographer, etc? You want to be single all your live long days? Play with peoples' hearts until it bites you in the ass? Make friends with everyone? Ignore the townsfolk altogether?

Go for it. The valley is your oyster...or star drop.

And that's just the base game. Modding the hell out of this game is super easy and opens up a whole lot more options if you're willing to try it out. There's at least 4 mods that add whole maps to explore. A lot of them are available on nexusmods.com or moddrop.com and you can branch out to other sites from there.  Be brave. Be bold. Enjoy the game as is and then mold it into the perfect soul sucking time waster tailored specifically to you! <3"
64,"Stardew Valley is an excellent game with a ton of depth to it. Stardew Valley is a game that immediately draws you in with its charming, almost childish visuals and unique art style. This game takes place in the small town ""Pelican Town"", where you'll have your farm and build up relationships with the people that live around you. Stardew Valley is a game about growing your small farm and discovering a way to build a life for yourself. Although this is a farming game, there's no real objective here — you just go out into the world and do whatever you want, from exploring dungeons to making friends, fishing, mining and much more. 

Stardew Valley provides a completely different experience than what you get from most other games. It is the sort of game that makes you forget all your worries and stresses. It manages to deliver the same feeling of joy and accomplishment while only featuring a handful of mechanics though the mechanics that the game provides are exceptionally polished. 

As for the music, The music is genuinely good. There are so many music tracks, and I love all of them. The music isn't anything exceptional, but the soundtrack is good and it fits perfectly with the theme of this game.

Stardew Valley is an impressive game. I can play this game for hours and will not get tired of it. All in all, Stardew Valley is an enjoyable game and I would suggest it to everyone. It is a well-rounded and enjoyable game to play. It is definitely worth the time and cost."

112,I love this game!! I love doing all the mods and having fun~!
113,This game is great. Let it ask you why you are busting your ass on this digital legacy instead of your RL legacy.
114,I love it
115,"Fun, Relaxing, great updates"
116,if you want to play a game thats actually good play stardew.
117,"Got the game a while ago. Did not know what I was doing so I hated it and uninstalled.

Saw a video on it and though oh heck lets try again and now I am so damn addicted I honestly need an intervention!
I have this on pc, console, mobile and switch.....

It is the best zone out game which keeps on surprising me and I still have not yet played it to 100%.

Give it a go its worth the hype!!"
118,amazing!
119,It's just fun lol. There's nothing to complain about.
120,k
121,pretty cool
122,This. game. is. SO. fun. PLAY IT!!!
123,Relaxing af
124,Good
125,"This game is fun and challenging at first as you uncover the mysteries of the town and romance NPCs. Get ready for a cute game with characters that have shockingly real and dark backstories. 
In this game you're a burnout who has decided to leave that job behind to take over your grandfathers farm. As would happen in real life, you get thrown right in with little direction and its up to you to figure out how you want to play and how the mechanics work"
126,SUPER CHILL AND LAX. HAVE TO DO SOME MONEY MANAGEMENT AT FIRST BUT YOU GOT THIS G

133,gay farm woohoo
134,ok
135,"I have so many hours on this game. It is so calming and I get lost in the game so much that I lose track of time. I highly recommend Stardew Valley to anybody.  I know that some FPS gamers don't tend to like Stardew Valley a lot especially since the pace of the game is slower than they like, but I don't mind it. You make your own experience and goals. I never felt pressure to fully complete the game and if I get tired of a farm, I just make a new one and it doesn't feel tedious to grind back up."

137,very fun haley is my baby girl

147,"A beautiful and cozy game I always come back to.
The mechanics are simple but fun, the story and characters are surprisingly complex and the music is so cozy. Anyone who likes the cottagecore aesthetic and wants to relax should play this game"
148,I play with my boyfriend and we have a blast playing every time! He's a major gamer and I'm just starting out and we are both able to participate and contribute.
149,"It's Stardew Valley. You don't need a recommendation, just play it."

seriously though i thought i wouldnt like this but its so fun for all types of players"
159,"good.
"
160,Me when Sebastian
161,"By far and away this is the most immersive game i've ever played.
=======
Pro's: the controls are really easy to learn, the pixel art in this game is beautiful as well. The game runs fine on just about anything, the characters are relatable, likable, lovable and well written. And it gave me a place to escape to during 2020-21.
=======
Con's: while i don't have any major complaints, it's fair to say the story has a little grind, but in the end it's worth it, like planting your plants watering them everyday nearly passing out each time but when then the harvest comes you get paid.
=========
Comments: also i like how this game is like real life. in that SDV looks perfectly idllic on the surface, but when you get to know the townsfolk, there's drama and problems.. but you know what? it's ok, and it gives more depth to the characters as well.
----------------------------
When should i buy?
i'd get it now if you want. or if you wanted to wait for a sale that's fine too.
----------------------------
Do i recommend this game? Yes."
162,dope
163,great game so much to do
164,"It's so much fun and there's so much to do. The characters are great, the customization options are wonderful. I feel like I'm always discovering something new to this game."

171,"i loveeee this game i started to play it on mobile but i noiticed it was a couple of updates behind so i saved up my money to get it on steam i also like to put mods on it . it is soo easy 10/10
"
172,yeah i like it.
173,great game but support up to 8 players would be nice
174,cute lil farm game make me go WOOOO
175,"This game is amazing by itself or with mods!
It's fun to play with friends, and it's pretty easy to get the hang of without needing much of a tutorial. The community is one of the best I've seen."
176,gud
177,wow
178,One of the most thoroughly thought through games of its kind.
179,farm i like its good... shane<3

184,iTS GOOD
185,"i love this game, it is so much fun!! I also have it on the nintendo switch and i bought it on here to play it on my laptop :)"
186,nice farming game :Đ
187,"This game is legit the best farming game I've ever played especially because if you don't like to farm you can do any other thing, it is not a game that has a right way to play it, the right way to play this game is your way to play it, the way you find it fun yourself."
188,is a virus
189,Tf are you reading these for? Go plant some ancient seeds.
190,"Its pogggg 
but better with friends lol"
191,"I actually despise this game. Every time I tried to play I would just get depressed and want to go outside. The game makes me feel like there's this huge world I'm missing out on outside my house and I should explore it, not sit and spend time on something that absolutely doesn't matter. It's strange because I don't get that feeling when I'm playing any other video game. Perhaps it's a testament to this games beautiful art that it moves me in such a way. Basically, don't get this game, get a life."
192,Fun farming sim with extra depth.
193,fud
194,<3
195,this game is literally so good ive been playing since release and i have never gotten bored once
196,yes

200,"This game really is a treasure.

By far one of my favorite games of all time. Everything in this game is made with so much love. The dialogs, the cutscenes, the love stories, the sprites E V E R Y T H I N G. I spent so much time in this game and I regret not one second. I achieved true perfection and got all the achievements. 

I would recommend everyone to at least give it a try or putting in on their wishlist.
Can't wait for the new game from ConcernedApe. ♥"
201,good

205,great game.
206,good
207,Best
208,"Farming game kind of fun I guess + Sebastian >>>>>>>>

I'm half-joking. Most addicting game I've ever played, and I love this game with my whole being. Vanilla is already a lot to take in and super fun (dropped at least 100 hours on vanilla Stardew), but once you get bored of vanilla then you can add as many mods as your computer can handle. It's endless with possibilities. First game I'm probably going to unknowingly drop 200 hours on. 

P.S. Mostly people who play casual games would like Stardew. If you like faster paced games chances are you won't like it."
209,fun
210,"its awesome
"
211,I've been playing this game since it came out and I will continue to play it until I die
212,omg this is awesome
213,When you cannot accomplish life boals in real life.. it's good to have a virtual alternative.
214,"Good game to kill some time, and I do mean kill some time...

Seasons take forever to pass so in order to get anywhere, you'll be at this game a while. 
Still, it is unique and somewhat enjoyable."
215,use [434] for stardrops.
216,NICE
217,it's fine
218,Had to settle for Sam because his dilf father is 'happily married'

227,This game make me happy :D
228,ok
229,"Stardew Valley is everything you want in a small town life simulator game.  You can do a wide array of activities including mining, farming, fishing, monster fighting, and more. It is a great combination of exploring on your own and having to complete tasks and quests. The game is relaxing and something fun to play to unwind. I have spent many hours enjoying this game and I'm sure I will spend many many more."
230,this games is fantastic its on my fav games but no stinky poo poo cacas in the beides haley poop
231,plenty of stuff to do and this game has lots of variety in its gameplay loops. pretty amazing for a game only 1 dude made.
232,I Like farming
233,Very fun if you like laid back games. Incredibly in-depth game play with many roads to choose for your own game play style.
234,top dog sucky sucky ten bucky
235,There's always new things to discover in Stardew Valley and a great fanbase. 10/10 escapist game i love fake farming
236,"You like Harvest Moon of course you do you want a game that is Harvest Moon crossed with more of Harvest Moon you have found that game. This game is good don't get me wrong but its all about the long game 160+ hours in and still not 100%'ed the game. If you are a perfectionist this game has a whole lot of things to keep you occupied. It's takes a certain type of people however to like the game I know people who find it ""boring"" and ""repetitive"" but in some way that is the charm doing the same thing again and again getting more and more money using that to buy more things its great fun."
237,Really relaxing game and you can honestly play for hour without realizing it.
238,"I've played this game for years, first on the XBox, then on my phone, then on the Switch, and, finally, on PC. From the beginning I have loved this game. It's become a special interest of mine, and is one of the few interests I've had that has stuck with me throughout the years. It's a calming game with beautiful character design, with the town and characters having deep lore than what meets the eye. The gameplay itself is amazing, and I love that you're constantly being given goals to reach without the game making it seem like you have to complete them. While some you have to complete to progress, the game doesn't constantly remind you of the goals, and it lets you play it at your own pace. Overall, 10/10 game."
239,relaxing
240,Such a fun game 10/10 would recommend
241,"An absolute joy for both seasoned gamers or newcomers to the hobby. Fun, relaxing and addicting in ways i cannot quite explain... feels like one of those life simulator games i used to play on my dad's phone when I was a young hatchling."
242,"Completely addictive. I've played it several times now - the last big update a year or so go added lots more excitement to the later game too. It's a really simple game but lots of lovely details, thoughtfully done and always something interesting to be getting on with!"
243,nice
244,"Great game to play when you are in the mood to relax. The stakes are so low which makes it perfect for people who want to disconnect their brain but still have a good time. Great romance options, lots to do around your farm, and even has dungeoneering! Highly recommend this game to anyone interested in the genre."
245,Pretty good game would recommend
246,Amazing very relaxing
247,A great alternative for people who like Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons games
248,Honestly... don't judge this till you play it. It looks naff because of the graphics and it took months for my friend to convince me to play it but I'm obsessed with it! So chill and relaxing! 1000% worth a try!
249,good game
250,hehe blue berries go BRRRRRRR
251,cool
252,"super cute and super engaging, so many cool side quests and awesome storyline"
253,one of those games where it just makes you want to keep playing over and over again
254,Very enjoyable and relaxing game.

259,Have played over 200 hours on mobile previously and that was the OG Stardew Valley. Absolutely love the game all over again.
260,"Great game! 
Somehow, I did not get as hooked as many other players, but let me say that the myriad mods improve a lot of things even more! (Portraits! The portraits are amazing!)

Still, I wish the dialogue and all else were a bit more targeted towards adults, though. Or that the storyline was darker. Alex, for example, for the first aspect I mentioned, is such a child and I've died a bit inside each time I've started a new game and got to that heart event where he makes fun of people who are sophisticated. 

The pigs also look ugly, and the things with whom you can catch seafood (and trash) ruin my whole aesthetic. :o 
Finally, crows are sinister by themselves, but must they also eat my crops? ):"
261,I'm just addicted to it. This game ha some charm.
262,I loved the graphics and how much thought was put into this games characters.

270,"This has been my favorite game since I first downloaded it in 2018. I've put nearly 1000 hours into the game, yet I'm not even close to tired of it. There's so much content to explore, and whether you're playing by yourself or with a group of others, there's always something that keeps you hooked for hours. I love the sheer amount of content this game has. I'm working through all the steam achievements at the moment, and I'm still finding new things about this game in the process. I love this game to bits and the cozy, comforting elements it has. At my best times and my worst times, it is a relaxing and wonderful way to pass the time. I also can't wait for Haunted Chocolatier!"
271,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

275,very very nice!! <3
276,"Gets boring at the 50 hour mark, but the first 50 hours are worth the money."
277,This game is hard to put down once you get into it.  After I finish a day I keep wanting to go complete tasks for the next day because I'm afraid I'll forget.  There's lots to do and tons to discover along the way.  The music is great and I like the 16-bit era aesthetic!
278,Love it so far. so cute and warm and wholesome. well polished with tons of good mechanics

287,"This game is underrated. It provides an area you can mindlessly play on and do required quests without stressing too much. Sometimes the quests are a bit difficult, but nothing that a wiki can't fix! The characterization of all characters have great storylines and good enlightenment of each character. I personally would like to mindlessly play together with friends towards a common goal."
288,good game...
289,very relaxing and can get a little lost in the world sometimes. feels like there is always something to do or something your aiming for.

293,very good. yes
294,awesome game
295,"I love this game. When I want to relax after a long day Stardew Valley never disapoints. 
Is similar to old games like harvest moon, that you have your farm and do stuff around town, go to a forest or a mine, but this game go a little further, the npc´s have an adult and reality point of view of the world. In that way I really immerse in the story. Also it has fantasy of course, like a wizard, monsters, misterys to be solved and cool diferent weapons that you can use.
...
If you alredy pass all the game you can always add mods and expand the story and experience."
296,Abby is best girl and if you disagree i hope crows eat your starfruit
297,Its good. Very good. Thanks.
298,"For the asking price this is a steal, also the fact that they added co-op multiplayer after so long since its release makes me respect the dev a lot. 
The game looks beautiful, it has a lot of variety in the possible activities (You are not stuck in the farm, during the day you go fishing, to the mines, meet people, do quests, buy a joja cola membership, etc)
It is relaxing but also rewarding as seeing your farm grow and your funds with it makes it so fun. Also a lot of customization and choice, you can make really unique farms with beautiful layouts and decorations if thats your jam, I prefer just farming and going ever bigger which is also possible.

If you ever played harvest moon then know that this is the same but better and with more content."

306,hehe funny farming game
307,Nothing that I can say that hasn't already been said about this game at this point. It's an all around fun and relaxing experience with characters that we can get to know and love. I always end up coming back to Stardew Valley and can't wait to see what else the Dev has in store for us with future projects!
308,Yes.

342,It's a great game with a lot of heart. Mods are also amazing for it.
343,"Combat and mining aspect of this game doesn’t have something special. Farming is also normal too. However the artstyle is pretty cute. And most important, npcs character development is pretty good. I love my husband  [spoiler]Sebastian[/spoiler] so much.

Why We Should Legalize Cannabis

Marijuana when used in the medical sense is beneficial to not only the patient’s health but to their financial status as well. In this report you’ll see many reasons why we believe this. Medicalmarijuana is used in many treatments. We are not obviously the only people who believe thiseither. In the last 20 years, 36 states have passed some form of legislation recognizing themedical value of marijuana. In 1996, voters in both Arizona and California passed laws allowingthe medical use of marijuana. In 1998 Alaska, Washington and Oregon passed medical usemarijuana laws, and in 1999 Maine passed a similar law (Grinspoon, 5). The chronic effects of marijuana are of greater concern for medical use and fall into two categories: the effects of chronic smoking, and the effects of THC. Marijuana smoking is associated with abnormalities of cells lining the human respiratory tract. Marijuana smoke, like tobacco smoke, is associated withincreased risk of cancer, lung damage, and poor pregnancy outcomes. It is the most widely usedillicit drug, marijuana is predictably the first illicit drug most people Although studies all suggestthat marijuana smoke is an important risk factor for the development of respiratory cancer, proof of this is yet to be seen (Iverson, 21). Marijuana is not a completely benign substance. However,except for the harms associated with smoking, the adverse effects of marijuana use are within therange of effects tolerated for other medications. The harmful effects to individuals from the perspective of possible medical use of marijuana are not necessarily the same as the harmful physical effects of drug abuse (Iverson, 24). For most people, the primary adverse effect of acutemarijuana use is diminished psychomotor performance. It is, therefore, inadvisable to operate anyvehicle or potentially dangerous equipment while under the influence of marijuana, THC, or anycannabinoid drug with comparable effects (Zimmerman, 45). A minority of marijuana usersexperience dysphoria, or unpleasant feelings. THC is the primary psychoactive ingredient inmarijuana. Cannabinoids are the group of compounds related to THC, whether found in themarijuana plant, in animals, or synthesized in chemistry laboratories. Cannabinoids likely have anatural role in pain modulation, control of movement, and memory. The natural role of cannabinoids in immune systems is likely multifaceted and remains unclear. The brain can andwill develop a tolerance to cannabinoids after a prolonged use of marijuana (Joy). Animalresearch has shown the possibility that dependence will occur, but this possibility is much lower than the chance of developing a dependence on benzodiazepines, opiates, cocaine, or nicotine.Withdrawal symptoms have also been seen in animal testing. The symptoms are much milder than the symptoms of withdrawal from some prescribed medications such as Valium and Codeine(Mathre, 25). Chemotherapy can often prolong someone’s life for many years. In some cases, acomplete cure can be obtained. Unfortunately, chemotherapy has many side effects associatedwith it that are not pleasant in the least bit. Patients sometimes find these effects so distressingthey abandon chemotherapy entirely. People with AIDS (Acquired Immune Disease) alsoexperience these problems (Zimmerman, 59). Studies with marijuana have shown that marijuanareduces the nausea and vomiting often associated with chemotherapy treatments. Because themarijuana does this, it provides two other benefits."

353,tree cut fun
354,"I have finally taken it upon myself to get through the majority of Stardew's content. It's an old game so i won't bother you with a long winded review.

The base Stardew game is phenomenal, and probably the best farming/life sim game on the market. My only complaint is the late game. Do not read any further if you don't wish to be spoiled to late game content.

Ginger Island is so far off of what I feel Stardew embodies that it felt like a slap in the face to have to play a glorified Scavenger hunt as the game's ""late game content."" It feels awful to leave behind the town you worked so hard to restored, and essentially start over. Not to mention how the time constraint feels so much worse there because it takes so long to get back if you don't use a totem."
355,fire ass game
356,hi
357,amazing game
358,I've modded this game to hell and back but I always come back to vanilla for the nostalgia and ability to simply turn my brain off and vibe

372,"This game is a classic, and although I held off playing it for many years I came to find it to be one of my favorite games."
373,Cute and friendly little farming game where you can make your own farm and a range of npcs to interact with. You can find mods on cursed forge and such.
374,"Finally, a fulfilling game. I can ignore real life tasks while gaming and still feel productive. 

P.S. Pierre, the reason your store is going out of business isn't because of JojaMart, it's because YOU'RE CLOSED ON WEDNESDAYS. YOU'RE A BAD BUSINESSMAN AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD.

375,Fun for casual gameplay but tons of depth for even hardcore gamers.
376,Such a beautiful addictive game!!!! So fun and adorable!
377,"My review:
     - Gameplay: 8.4/10, farming game, but close to farmer simulator.
     - Story : 8.9/10, always fall in love with simple but solid story.
     - Visuals : 8.2/10, very overpowered pixel art.
     - Sound : 8.7/10, listen once, and you'll remember it everytime.
""It took me 115 hours to finish this game to the end, this is my second round. My first round was with the pirates, approx 300 hours more to understand all the mechanics and find out what the achievements are so (I played it when I'm in High School) that I can do it in the first year [unfortunately I still use mod :""( ]. But, this is the gardening simulation game that I like the most. enjoy it for the rest of my life. I don't know why I'm not bored, I repeat this again from the first year in this second round with Steam. Anyway, I will always recommend this game to anyone who loves Harvest Moon games and the like.""
     - Overall : 100/10 [Buy this game, even without discount you won't regret it.]
P.S. Probably in third round, I'll beat this game fair and square, and faster."

384,fun!!
385,GOOOOD
386,"I can only think of 3 reasons for people to enjoy this game

0 They're teenagers or young adults

1 they have plenty of time and not much to do with it (e.g. homework is done)

2 They have little or no experience in real life and are using the ""dating simulator"" as a substitute

3 Everyone says it's good, so they say it's good as well

Which doesn't mean it's a bad game. But much expectation comes out for a game that has overwhelmingly positive score. And by the moment you buy it and realize you have so much to do, I mean SO MUCH do to and your reward comes in pixels, I'm sure that'll disappoint some people

I tried it once, maybe twice. The lack of direction and the repetitive mundane chores killed me 

Also, as far as I could see you can talk to key people only once a day (there's even a checkbox). Basically you'll have to simp them over and over just to un install the game in the future

Excellent game, 10/10 according to Steam. But do I recommend it? No, I don't."
387,balls
388,"Fun comfort game with lots of stuff to do, really relaxing but can also be a grind kind of game. There's basically no way you can play the game wrong, and there's a way to play for every type of person. Cute animals are a plus. The bachelor and bachelorettes commonly lack character until hearts are raised up (sometimes even requiring 10+ hearts), many of them also seem to be pretty young. About half the marriage candidates seem to be just out of high school/in college. The older characters/non marriage candidates are much more fleshed out with more character. Multiplayer can be tedious to set up sometimes, but it's really fun and usually functions pretty well. Would definitely say it's more geared towards single-player play though."
389,pretty gud
390,Good game yes
391,good to play with a date.
392,aight
393,"super chill game, get baked and enjoy"

This game is the roots of my Vietnam ancestor. Every seed I plant, every rock I mine, every crop I harvest, every chicken I molest is a pleasure to me. Hats off to Stardew Valley for the game!

410,"Stardew Valley is such a fun game to just chill out with.  I love to listen to audiobooks or podcasts while I play.  It's got some excitement in it, monsters to fight and such, but mostly it's just a game about farming and building up your relationships with small town folks.  It's incredibly comforting."
411,would be 10/10 if i could date Linus
412,BUY IT!
413,stardew valley is an amazing game that suits all types of players and its interesting story and the fun characters! defenitly reccomend!
414,"Stardew Valley is incredible. On a base level the game is well thought out and designed. The world feels large enough without being cramped with its restrictions. Gameplay is straightforward but not always easy. In a relaxed environments you must learn to plan far, far ahead. This game can be added to greatly with mods for ease, quality of life, aesthetic, humor, etc. Mods are not required, as the game is amazing start to finish. But the amazing mod community has added so much more content to help you really get your monies worth for years to come."

435,"I can't stop playing this game.

I would go as far as to say that Stardew Valley is one of the best games in the last decade.

If you're even slightly into life sims like Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing, give ConcernedApe's magnum opus Stardew Valley a long, introspective, time-munching look."

443,Classic and addictive
444,"This is one of my all time favorite games. A favorite to the point I have purchased four copies total of the game on different devices. There is a lot to explore in terms of content related to NPC's, as they all have their own unique stories. You have freedom to create a farm of your liking, with different maps available to choose from that each have their own benefits depending on what you want to focus on. The creator of the game put a lot of love into creating this, and I look forward to seeing what future projects he has in store."

446,"this game is perfect for relaxation and a good game to play in your downtime! it's the perfect mix of competitive if you're racing to complete the game and laid back if you'd like to romance your bachelorette or bachelor of choice. overall, it's an amazingly developed game with lots of surface and hidden content to enjoy!!"
447,This game is a masterpiece. I simply love how relaxing and fun is the game
448,Added polygamy mod. Best SFW Harem Simulator ever.

451,"one of the best time consuming games out there, I'm never bored with the endless opportunities!"
452,Easy to lose track of time while playing. Lots of freedom to build the farm you want
453,Stardew has come a long way and I hope it continues to grow. It's a simple game which I feel is the bulk of its charm; it's a farm sim with a bunch of interesting character npcs and a decent plot amidst a sea of games that try to be complex but fail or games that don't even try. What I mean to say is there are definitely more interesting or exciting games but that's not this game's point. If you want to have a decently fun time running a farm (maybe with some friends) then this game works fine.

474,Fantastic game! Best life sim out there. #FUCKSHANE
475,"What's there to say? It's a classic. If you don't know or haven't played Stardew, what's wrong with you?"
476,Great game to chill and work your way through - highly recommend
477,The game is very chill and good.
478,good game
479,m
480,One of my favourite games. Recently bought it for myself again and would never regret it!
481,YES OMG I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH
482,"I love this game. I have mainly played it on switch, but there is so much to do, and it has great replay value as well. For the price you really cannot go wrong."
483,"cured my depression
very guud"
484,"Few games have made me play 8 hours straight - this is one of them. Highly addictive, great music, relaxing, and gives you an actual sense of pride and accomplishment,"
485,I love that it's a relaxing game: you get to choose your own adventure with some loose goals here and there.
486,"10/10

Shane is hot."
487,sooooooo fun to play
488,"If you ever played games like Harvest Moon, then you'll absolutely love Stardew Valley. It has an amazing balance of farming, mining, fishing, monster slaying, quests, romance, friendship, and many other secrets to uncover. Each NPC has a rich storyline that really pulls you into the complexity of Stardew Valley society. Perhaps its only flaw is how absurdly enjoyable it is. The rest of my Steam Library is beginning to gather dust because I have been dedicating every free gaming hour to SV. And the replay value is extremely high. Not only are there constant updates, but there are multiple mods you can download that add extra playable content (new characters, maps, crops, animals, storyline, etc.). I've replayed my own farm multiple times as I find new mods, and I always feel like I'm starting a brand-new adventure. Stardew Valley is a MUST HAVE for just about anyone."
489,This is one of my favorite games I've ever played. I recommend it to anyone who likes farming and adventure games. The soundtrack to this game is amazing too.
490,it good game i like
491,Great fot light gaming on on laptops.
492,"I really like this game, however I got bored after the community centre was completed sadly."
493,love it
494,This game is very wholesome and relaxing.
495,"this game is a baseline for comparison in my mind. yeah, it's a good game."
496,This game is one of the best farming games out there!
497,It's aight.
498,"I love this game, it's very relaxing and a good way to kill time. There are a few quests in the game that I did have to look up on the wiki but them being mysterious is the point. Once you have kids in the game they don't age up past toddlers which is something I would change if I could, having your kids grow up and date, marry, and have kids of their own. I would also like if after you get married the single villagers got married. But all in all, I do love this game"
499,"sexy

500,"ITS MY FAVOURITE GAME. Stardew Valley has so much amazing content and you can play for hours without getting bored. Unique NPCs with different backstories, some heart events literally made me cry. The artstyle is just so beautiful too. There is much good things I can say about Stardew Valley, I cant even describe how much Iove  this game. :))"
501,"Okay, I bought this game for 15$. I really just wanted to play this game with my friends but one of them got sick of it quick. This game is a slower paced game. And at first glance just seems like there is only three things to do. But there is so much more. From unlocking the community center to getting all of the crops, there is so much to do. I just wish my friend had not gotten sick of it so quick. This game is far better when you are playing with friends. Yes it's a good game singleplayer, but multiplayer is so much more fun. There is so much interesting lore to this game and I wish I could still play this with my friends, but they got sick of it. 

I understand this is not the review everyone wants to hear, but just understand before buyimg this that there is a lot of things to do in this game."
502,abigaille evlenecem diye tarlayı falan bıraktım pişmanım evlendik evde 5 kuruş para yok salça ekmek ile geçiniyoruz iban atsam para atacak varmı
503,Its really good.
504,Stardew valley is so deep like it just seems like a normal game in reality there are hundreds of hours of gameplay
505,Very chill game. Love it.
506,It is a calm and peaceful game full of fun quests and story lines.

517,abigail feet pic
518,
519,relaxing and calming to play you easily can get super sucked into stardew
520,It is perfect.
521,"This is THE farming sim to play, it is just an absolutely fantastic experience with a good pace and doesn't make you bored after the first hour of play, like some others might. If you want some nice, relaxing Harvest Moon/Animal Crossing-like gameplay, this is it. And the developer is the GOAT, consistently having come out with new updates throughout the years."
522,"Oh boy, I love Terraria, and even though this game aint as sandbox as Stardew Valley, it is really enjoyable nice farming simulator. Not like the ones with tractors and stuff, but it have its magic. I played it even with a friend of mine and multiplayer is really enjoyable. Fighting  mining and even faming is enjoable at it owns and I love games, where you can marry someone, but it aint as easy as in other games. And the story even though it aint the most important thing, it does kinda tickle your heart and makes you... comfortable in its own way."
523,"It's Stardew. If you like sims, it's a must-play."

530,good game
531,"Epic




'nuff said"
532,i have an addiction to this game
533,cant date mayor lewis 0/10
534,"I love this game so much. I have ADHD and OCD and get overstimulated/overwhelmed in life and Stardew is a wonderful escape. This game helped me through a rough couple of months in which my grandmother hid a terminal cancer diagnosis until she died unexpectedly and my mom had a stroke. It kept me sane when I had my tonsils out and almost died. More often than not, it keeps me sane through each semester working towards a Master's degree. This game is for everyone and the mods open so many possibilities. Such a lovely game."
535,"Base game has enough content to last you at least fifty hours and the mods will give you everything you want. Quality of life, visual tweaks, or whole additions that should be paid DLC all by the community is amazing. Play it casually or let it consume your entire day."
536,"I've been interested in this game for a long while, but much like Animal Crossing, its a slow burn. However, once you get in the thick of things, its starts taking off. Its also pretty amazing the battery life you get on the Steam Deck. Enjoyable no stress gameplay."
537,If you're in depression this game gonna cure you. Maybe not 100% but give it a try.
538,I love chickens
539,you can stardew my valley any day
540,"It's Stardew valley, play it."
541,"so fun game cow chicken

542,I like the fishing
543,Honestly one of the best farm sims. Its a nice a peaceful game that's enjoyable even with some grinding.
544,"Such a Great Game! I play it with my friends and cannot explain how great this game is! Such a vary of endings, and a great community!"

552,yes
553,Harvey.....
554,This game got me through a lot of bad times
555,Yes I recommend Stardew Valley. It's a nice pleasant experience where you can do what you want and fish all day or go after it by trying to complete the community center by year one and get your dead grandpa's approval. There have been so many updates and there's so much endgame content that you can sink hundreds of hours into it and still see new things.
556,yay
557,"Very busy

561,Incredible game with a great modder community
562,"So my friend bought this game and after a while he started forcing me like crazy to buy it too because it was so ""good"". Me being skeptical said ""no"" because why waste money on a game that doesn't pique my interest. Anyway he gave up, and instead gifted me this game. YES! He did, and boy oh boy do i fucking love this game, to the point that i play it like 12 hours a day no joke... so YES absolutely recommended!!"
563,love it so much
564,relaxing game 10/10
565,my chicken watched her egg turn into mayonnaise

567,"I first got into this game thinking I wouldn't like it, BOY WAS I WRONG!  I found myself spending hours and hours in this game trying to perfect the farm, renovating, and just overall finding myself continuing to spend time just customizing everything I could.  This game sets a narrative in front of you, with room to create your own, I wish more games of this caliber would do that and I love this mechanic!  I hope there is a sequel in the works because I want to check it out!"
568,"Cozy, in-depth and relaxing"
569,Awesome game!! Very comfy cosy! Highly recommended if you are wanting to just relax and chill!  Lots of things to discover in Stardew!
570,I own 9 chickens :)
571,Peaceful and relaxing.
572,if eric adds bats in the next game im gonna disown my children

I'm about to be fired from my job because I called out just to play this game. I have skipped school to tend to my farm duties. My girlfriend wants to move out because all I do is play Stardew Valley. Overall this game is one of the games of all time. 100% Recommend, 10/10, I wish I could play it again for the first time."
581,its amazing
582,"MUCH GOOD, BIG FARM"
583,this game has no equal

587,Its good and cool looking.
588,I like to grow the food and mine the mine. Fish all the fish too.
589,"i have this game on my xbox, my phone, and computer. its incredible"
590,"Even though you can have sex in multiplayer, there is no highly detailed parts of it. I think the developers should really add sex scenes to this very fun and family friendly game to give children a better view on what happens before their born.
I would be very happy and so would thousands of parents across the globe if you add details like this in the next major update.

Add workshop support too."
591,Greatest game of all time

599,"If you haven't heard of Stardew Valley before, then I'd be amazed. Take something like the notable Animal Crossing and mix it with a little bit of Terraria, and you have one of the most beautiful, addicting, heartwarming farming/life sim RPG of recent years. The sheer amount of love and passion that went into creating this game is even more apparent once you boot it up for the first time and hear that GODLIKE music.
While the first play-through can be a little daunting or confusing at first, you'll soon realize the game just wants you to live in its world, of course you have your quests with the Journal, but overall this is game that just wants you to live and experience its warm, welcoming atmosphere. Which, to tell you the truth, is incredibly refreshing considering how industrialized real life is, sometimes, you really need to step aside and get a fresh perspective of things. (so if you support Joja Co. You're a menace.) I'm glad to be able to support the developer of this game, and hope that one day, a sequel comes out and improves on every single aspect of this one. (which would be hard to do, unless you're pedantic.)

Also, you can get married.
10/10."
600,it allows me to marry people
601,incredible addictive game
602,Stardew valley is a perfect game for people who like a casual experience when gaming. The game does not require previous skill in similar games and is a great starter game for anybody who is trying to get into gaming. i personally recommend this and i don't even play games like this all that much so it is a good pick from an excellent indie developer
603,big cheez it energy
604,just fantastic
605,"I had a husband, a kid, and a horse. Had"
606,"How am I supposed to forage, mine, fish, and farm all in one day?"

611,"Very simplistic game, however it has no ends to its fun :D"
612,"This and probably always will be one of if not my favorite games of all time. It is the only game that I have bought on multiple platforms just so I could play it more often. The atmosphere, game play loop, and everything else about this game has been fine crafted to create what has become my favorite experience in gaming. Truly a masterpiece of a game."
613,BEST
614,This is just an amazing game 10 out of 10 love it
615,M-more like...Stardoodoo Valley heheheheheheh *gun shot*
616,one of the most calming and sweet game has been helping me pass time in AIT and the military while im off to relive stress
617,Marrying Abigail was the best thing that happened to me; she is real.
618,This game is fun and i dont really have any complaints
619,"It's a really good game , never boring. YOU SHOULD PLAY IT!!!"
620,"Idk man sometimes you just wanna run a cute little farm and this game definitely delivers. I personally find it super calming to water crops and tend grounds etc, it's almost like a digital version of cleaning my room i guess? Many of the systems have far deeper progression then you'd expect and the story and your relationship with the town is really really special. Deeply hype pogchamp game!

Runs well on Crystal Linux (Native, Steam Flatpak)"
621,"Stardew Valley is a cute little game all about farming in and exploring the fictional town of Pelican's Foley while cultivating relationships with the townsfolk. It's the type of game you can really immerse yourself in to escape the woes of reality. There are four seasons with a plethora of crops to grow, a ton of fish to catch, and many livestock to raise. The entire design of the farm is up to you and you can choose what to specialize in developing. Sell your products and go mining so that you can buy upgrades for your tools and continue to improve the farm. The game has a really nice focus on exploration and interaction and is perfect for relaxing. It can be a little menial at times but for some people, that's exactly what they need to really immerse themselves and escape.

The story is brief and follows our players being exiled to a farm by their grandfather following an incident at their office job. The outside world beyond the town is inaccessible. The players can not leave.

The first time I started Stardew Valley, I had a feeling that something felt off. I was trying to farm in the mountains and the sun would be shining on the mountain slopes. I could hear the wind, but nothing felt right. I kept trying to farm, kept going through the same routines over and over again, and couldn't understand why my farm wasn't progressing. Eventually, I realized that it was my crops. They weren't doing well up there in the mountains. They weren't going to grow well anywhere. Some players may run into this same issue, but the remedy is to use the other crops in the game. Certain crops are just inferior, I've found the starfruit and bones (You children, helpful lump) to be the least useful. The red or green tractor may also help in this scenario as it allows you to rapidly process anything.

One of the many townsfolk you can meet is mustachioed everycitizen Garry Papandré who often torments you for both your aesthetic disobedience and lack of significant mustache. If you aren't mentally prepared this event can be devastating, and so he is my favorite. Garry's character has the second most romance options in the game only beaten out by the wizard, but who wants a hobo wizard? Papandré is pretty quick to start relationships with you and is willing to offer a deal to increase his social rank which makes him a strong option for most. Town events will boost his social bonuses threefold.

The game really picks up once you acquire the cooly named army vehicles depot (Jeremy the Moose) who spawns the green or red tractor for you. For reference, the tractor is also known as the little red or green fighter (Shooar Scout mini-land cruiser) and other characters will refer to it as such. The green or red tractor lets you access the ""Museum"" which counter logically must make walking around more difficult for you, thereby enforcing the use of the tractor or the public transit options from this point on. The museum allows you to stash your artifacts for a reward from the librarian. This treasure trove offers helpful decorations, gameplay beneficial trinkets, and the like.

[hr][/hr]

Pros:

Plenty variety in all aspects of this game.

Several town events every year.

Blue Eyed Donna Is the shortest kiss and can be engaged to Danny Duck ""Manslaughter"" Mepanin.

The letter ""N"" statue and Devon statue often have special abilities together and Devonmutes are apparently real.

Cons: 

Cutscenes get extremely drab at times.

The game gets boring after the red and green tractor becomes required in your farm. I got through nine years of the game before using either option.

Verdict:

Stop chasing your tail. 7.2/10"
622,it is sooo fun and there is so much to do
623,I play too much.
624,The most stressful relaxing game. I love it

626,There are a lot of features that are missing currently in the mobile version and it's pretty immersive so far.
627,Sebastian
628,"I really love this game even after completing the game many times I still find new things from Easter eggs to lore about the villagers and their background. It's a very relaxing fun game and allows you to really explore your options as you are not limited to making money through just farming. As well as different types of player play styles. Highly recommend this game for people who also like animal crossing, and harvest moon."

635,"What is there to say about Stardew that hasn't already been said? It's the quintessential farming sim game, it's hard to think of any that hit all the bases that this game does. I've been a longtime fan of Harvest Moon games, but Stardew surpassed all of them, especially after all the free updates the game received over the years."
636,i am completely obsessed with this game. please help i'm trapped i can't get out
637,MMMMM........Crops.
638,Really love this game! No one dislikes Stardew Valley I would say. With mods on nexus it becomes more convenient and interesting.
639,"Very good game, mmm yes, good game"
640,"Grow weeds, collect shells, fight bugs. That's about it."
641,"Simple yet intricate game for all skill levels to pass a few hours yet have fun doing it,"

652,really fun but not left handed friendly. i cant find a single way to adjust the mouse settings and its driving me crazy. and ive seen posts/discussions/comments about how thats been an issue since at least 2017. i can change literally any other key except for the mouse controls. makes the game very frustrating for me

663,"this game is just kinda boring to me. I understand why people like it, but I just can't give it a positive review. if you like relaxing games with no stress, you will like this game."
664,"Really like the game, it's very peaceful and there isn't a clear goal except keep your farm running. I like booting up this game whenever I have nothing to do or just need to wind down. The quests; though a bit tedious at time, aren't too challenging, and most of them aren't required anyway. The game does reward who when you put time in it, especially when you go exploring. Although for the brute-force players, you are going to need to interact with characters regularly to progress parts of the game. My only real problem is the FISHING, it is TOO HARD. 9/10 game, would recommend"
665,Stardew Valley is a great way to experience the wonder of an NES game on Steam!
666,"energetic, engaging, entertaining, endearing, enveloping."

677,"An sich im Ansatz ein Gutes Spiel.
Aber einige Mechanics sind ja mal so bodenlos schlecht dass ich mir denke, sobald das ein modder sieht würde das aber sofort rausgepatched werden. Wer denkt sich bitte, dass random Items bei Tod verlieren ein sinnvolles System ist, wenn unter den Items auch wichtige Gegenstände wie z.B. Schwerter usw. sein können. Auch würde ich ein solo playthrough in dem Spiel absolut unspaßig vorstellen. Würde die gleiche reichweite an aufgaben und Tätigkeiten in einem MMO sein würde man die Quests als repetetiv und fetch bezeichnen.
Aber vlt. auch einfach nicht meine Welt ..."

684,"An amazing game. I love the character personalities and the chill farming experience.

Modding just makes it even better. Mods that make Marnie stay in her shop during her business hours, mods that expand the map, mods that allow visible fish in the water. So many amazing options.

I really encourage you to get this game, it has been worth every cent I've paid for it and more."
685,"One of the best game out there!!  Can be relaxing or challenging, tons of way to achieve your goals, lots of replay potential and such a nice community with lots of mods that can totally change your experience!

708,Really does take you back to the SNES Harvest Moon days.
709,It's a lot of fun and easy to get lost in. A lovely community.
710,"This may be my favorite game of all time. I've bought it on multiple platforms for myself and purchased multiple copies on PC to gift to people in order to play multiplayer with them.

While there are some goals in the game you can work towards, there are very few things --maybe one cutscene that has no in game impact -- that you can't do later in the game. I love being able to set my own tasks and focus a full year on mining or farming or visiting townspeople or fishing and not worry about missing anything.

It's a perfect mix of relaxation and challenge. I also love all the updates that have been added to the game since I started with $0 extra cost when some of them definitely would have been sold as DLC by a different developer.   10/10 game, I will be playing this game for a long time to come"

"
732,"A very charming and enjoyable experience, simple on the surface with a lot of depth there if you want to delve in.

One of the most active modding communities i've ever seen allowing expansion and changes to the game quicker than even the worlds fastest developers allows you to keep the game interesting so you can keep coming back for more, not really my kind of game usually but I find myself coming back to this once in a while."
733,"Nice, relaxing, and really let's you play at any pace, in any way or career that you prefer. I also really love the pixel graphics and the music X3 It makes for some great long-term gameplay"

737,"Amazing game! I was hesitant to play Stardew at first because it, quite simply, didn't fit into my usual genre of games. While I don't feel as though I necessarily missed out on anything due to the nature of the game, I do kind of wish I had gotten into it earlier because of how much I enjoy it. This is a great game with so much attention to detail in some of the smallest things, especially having been made by one person! It is fun, interesting, interactive, and something I can talk to my wife and coworkers about because they also play. I haven't even gotten into the modded side of the game and it's still fun enough that I have about 3 saves I play on between switch and PC. It's always nice to get games for free or on sale, but I wouldn't hold back if you have the money to spend and it's full price because Concerned Ape deserves the monetary support for this one in hopes that other great games come forth later on!"

There is a whole lot to do, and even after playing for many many hours, there will still be things to do. If you ever get tired of the music,(hopefully you wont because its amazing) playing your own music in the background can make farming more fun."
751,"Cozy art and small details really brings this game to life visually, and with the wide variety and depth of the gameplay it is difficult to find yourself idling about wondering what to do.

The variety also means that it has something to offer to almost everyone."

Before you know it, you've eaten four pizzas and your wife is yelling at you because its already 4 in the morning and you have to be up in 2 hours for work, but she just doesn't get how you've been waiting for truffles and you finally have them so you just say you're playing one more day and you do but by the time you turn off the game your kids have grown up and moved out, your wife left you, and your goldfish has been dead for 3 years.

786,"Where do I start with this masterpiece? I suppose my play-time probably speaks for itself, but this little, seemingly simplistic farm sim is full of depth, character, and an amazing feedback loop.

While I got it for half off during its 5-year anniversary, this is a game I would not hesitate to pay full price for, especially since it goes towards an incredibly hard-working developer (read: single person) who delivered something everyone can play (though some more mature content would make me suggest at least 12 or 14+).

Don't get me started on the mods. The mod support is insane for this game and can completely change the way you play. SMAPI is our overload."
787,"I don't know how ı could define this game without mentioning my feelings.Well, First things first, I would like to say that this game ought to play with somebody who is precious for you and should be talking about your emotions or life in the game. I've played this game with a special person and it was such a heart-warming experience for us.

When I entered the game in the first time, the special one and I found myself with bad-condition house and farm. First days we wandered and explored every stuff like people, their home and bunch of chore... By the time we coped with and got a grip on those things, we started to get bigger and maturer in the game and as a two people who talk about those things. All distressing chores and being destitute turned out, we feel so relax mentally and economcly

The things I understand from this game is believe in somebody that cares you and wants you to be more of you. If you give your back on somebody, you and him or her always get much better of you. The leadership of controlling your emotions increases with trusting your own skills and the others'.

The second things is realising how important the moment of current. If you always feel like you strugle with something that bothers you more that it has to be normally, and you could do nothing, for that you feel anxious about future of problem, this game teach you how important your current days are. I propose you playing this game to learn that.

Stardew Valley one of the special kind you can find rarerly, It does something that makes you feel the life ,and lastly, I recommend you to look into how this game made ;)."
788,W game W rizz
789,"While i only have a small amount of play time on here, i have bought and played this game on 3 separate platforms.  On a different one i have played about 400 hrs.  I truly adore this game.  The character nuances, the deeper feels, the music and scenery are all from the heart. 

 At first you have no idea what you are doing and think, ""what? why does everyone love this game so much?"" but if you tuck in a little bit, in no time you are just as much enamoured with it.  It touches on some tougher and more mature content including addiction, suicide, and damaged family units, which is part of what makes it so magical... as it is so reminiscent of our own imperfect lives and imperfect characters. 

It is a farming, crafting, fishing, foraging and fighting in the mines kind of game, but oh so much more.  The fact that all of it, music/art/story/coding is all done by one person is astounding.  Give it a try and you will see why it has such a cult following.  Replayability is excellent as well."

I have been playing this game for a year and till now i haven't found anything that could make me regret playing this !It's a video-game full of things to do and places to explore. You make crops and  raise animals too!! You take their products and sell,you earn money from them and use them to buy other things like animals,seeds... etc. But the best thing (in my opinion) is that you can upgrade your house and decorate it too!!!!EVERYBODY who likes farming,adventure and exploring new places should try this AMAZING GAME."

868,"Where to start with Stardew Valley?

I think I can best compare this to Old School Runescape.

Why?

Because when I maxed on OSRS it felt like something that after a while, I HAD TO DO.

You get the same feeling playing Stardew, specially once you learn the game mechanics a little more and then delve into the lore, story and extensive gameplay that will keep you playing for DAYS, not just hours.

Pros,

Hundreds of hours of gameplay, especially for us completionists out there.
So much deep lore that is hopefully the start of an extensive universe.
Character development for EVERYONE.
A brutal learning curve where you will put pressure on yourself, but feel good for doing it.
Polished and well thought out mechanics.
One developer who has cared for so many years that it is admirable, take a bow.
A good sized map, although could do with more expansions for late gamers.
Everything is upgradeable, you are never perfect, there is always something more to do.
A really helpful community with seemingly no toxicity.
Easy co-op mechanics where my friends can drop in and out, even of my single player worlds.
Incredible mod support, with again an amazing community creating them.
Graphically this game did it first, many others tried to copy, but Stardew nails it.
Reward for the grind, which is something OSRS lacks for me, with Stardew I can SEE the reward.
Following on from that, very little is RNG based, you need to make your own RNG (luck).
So much to do it can be a little overwhelming, but you will get on top of it all and feel like a king.
Oh and.. I LOVE THE FISHING MINIGAME!
All expansions and updates have been FREE!

Cons,

Now don't shoot me but I don't think the Island expansion isn't up to the usual high standard.
The grind on the island is somewhat worse than any other grind in the game, I didn't enjoy it.
With so little as a reward, so little to tempt me there aside the Qi door, I can just go down Skull Cavern.
It just feels so out of place in the game, and I know I will get hate for the above!
Best parts about the late game are locked behind the island though, which is a small downer.

Again that con is just personal preference, maybe I just haven't done it right.

I feel as though you need another 'bad guy' after completing the community centre.
JoJo is fun but after there isn't much use for the community centre and all the hard work.
The desert feels rather empty, I know mods change this but I like vanilla games more than anything.

Okay that is it, I honestly can't think of anything else 'bad' and those few things won't stop you from having an extremely large amount of fun, especially with friends. I know my comparison to OSRS may be unusual but that is how the game made me feel.

A satisfying grind that, unlike OSRS, I am still playing now."
869,.
870,mid
871,"great replay value, easy to get too grindy and optimization focused though"
872,"i am very lonely. this game allowed me to obtain a wife. Very Unrealistic, would play again"
873,a
874,Its still a great game after all these years
875,"Oh my god 16 hours and I'm already addicted! just to preface this I am not the target audience for this game based on the other types of games I generally play but I REALLY enjoy this game, I'm barely even through year 1 and I'm having a blast catching tons of fish, doing a bit of co-op with my buddies, I genuinely recommend this game to ANYONE whether your 12 or 42 you can have a positive experience for a low price."
876,this game brings me so much joy and it's so easy to sink time into!!
877,"For those long term farming sim players, the best way I could describe Stardew Valley is a ""welcoming combination of Harvest Moon (Story of Season), Rune Factory and Animal Crossing"".

It has the grindiness of Harvest Moon, yet with plenty of automation options that simplify routine tasks and leave only what matters to you; it has the combat of Rune Factory, but with linear and simplistic weapon and skill advancement; it has the custimisation of Animal Crossing, yet still providing goal-focused players with a sense of development and purpose.

Heck, even the developer is great! Providing plenty of free additional content and updates, when the game is only $16.99??? I mean shut up and take my money!

............

Honestly, the only thing I wish Stardew Valley had is better story. It is quite cliche at times, but at this point that's just too much to ask."

[also yes i know i'm a few years late to this game but it's still good, ok?]"
885,"Stardew Valley has become my absolute favorite game to play when I feel like I need a ""break"". It's nice to escape the world of online multiplayers and go back home to Pelican Town and observe my wife stare into the lamps as if she's part moth, or have a wild night in the skull cavern. Harvey makes a killing off of me. 🤣 Cannot wait for Haunted Chocolatier! 🥰"

911,"I am starved of human interaction, this game fulfills that void part of my soul."
912,it is as fun as it looks
913,"there is so much clear charm and love put into this game, its quite amazing. The first time you play this game you really do feel lonely, but as time progresses each character opens up to you in a very real and sincere way, and you feel like more than just the lonely farmer. this game feels so vast even though it takes place in such a small town, to this day I have not completed or found everything, even though I want to. The only serious (albeit minor) critique I have of this game is the diversity of the cast. I know people are like ""erm actually its not realistic for there to be black people in a rural community like this"" like sure I guess they're right but I don't really care if it would make sense or not LOL. I would've loved to see a trans character or any other race than white"
914,soo good

916,"Best farming sim out there. As someone who loves harvest moon, it does definitely have problems. Stardew Valley gets rid of those problems, adds the good things from animal crossing, and there we go, thats Stardew Valley.

925,One of the best story lines in a game that I've played.  What's great about Stardew is that you can choose different story lines to follow every time.  You can choose to do all kinds of different things to make the game unique so you can play over and over and never get bored or burnt out.  I have a couple different mods that make the game even more enjoyable.  This is one that I will definitely keep coming back to.

If calming, SNES nostalgia by way of small town farming is your thing, then this game will scratch that itch. Only thing I think could be improved is syncing between the Steam and mobile versions. Yes, it's also on mobile. It's also good on that platform."

955,"I'm an inexperienced gamer who was recommended Stardew Valley because I enjoyed Farmville. Unfortunately, my experience with Stardew Valley was extremely frustrating and left me disappointed. There's no tutorial whatsoever so the player has zero guidance on what to do when you wake up in bed in your farmhouse. I couldn't even figure out how to get the character out of bed and had to google for help guides, which is when I learned about the WASD keys, which is something I've never heard of before. Once I got out of the house, I figured out how to clear my farm but I had no idea what else to do. I wandered around, trying to get help from NPCs, which was a failure. In order to start activities like farming or fishing, there was no guidance provided and I had to check online videos to tell me what to do. Essentially, the game feels like a point-and-click mystery game where you have to click on a variety of objects around you and see what they yield. That's the only way a new player would figure out that the present on the farmhouse floor contains your first parsnip seeds or that the mailbox contains a letter that invites you to meet an NPC at the beach who will give you your fishing rod. This clue-solving approach is fine for mystery puzzle games but it's not what I expected with a farm sim.

I had some additional problems, which are personal rather than being a reflection of the game. Unlike with Farmville, Stardew Valley starts out with the player being completely alone on their depressing, overgrown farm. Add in the day/night cycle (which I'd never encountered before in a game) and the weather effects (again - not something I've seen before) and I ended up spending multiple in-game days working by myself on my farm, clearing endless debris while it rained and eventually got dark. It was extremely depressing and lonely and made me feel like crap, which is the exact opposite of why I wanted to play this game.

Overall, I know my bad experience is purely a result of my inexperience as a gamer but this game is constantly recommended on lists for newbie gamers who enjoyed Farmville, which sets up certain expectations for the game design experience and I feel those expectations weren't met."
956,why is everyone so mean to me :(
957,:)
958,Just a fun game. especially with friends
959,very nice. lots to do.
960,One of the best games I've played!
961,"I like it. It heals my soul. I also am trying to get full perfection, but I did get in game perfection. I guess that means my soul needed lots of healing...."
962,i mean its alright
963,farming is fun
964,best game eva
965,"It's been a while since I played video games. This is a good, calming game to play. The time goes by really fast when I play this game. I'll start at 2p.m. and finish at 6 a.m."
966,"This game taught me life lessons

At first, I decided to not read any tutorials before playing - and found the game to be rather overwhelming. There were simply so many, in fact too many, things to do at once and with little guidance. I had to find building materials, build things, do the community bundles, mine, fight monsters, fish, forage, be nice to other villagers, all the while spending the majority of my mornings literally watering plants because I was too poor to afford a good sprinkler (and by the time I was done, I had little energy/time left for everything else). 

I was stressed out, which kinda destroyed my purpose of playing Stardew. Then I stopped and thought to myself, why the hurry? The game is an infinite cycle of seasons and I'm not trying to compete against anyone. Heck, making money isn't even a necessity. I could literally sit on a bench and do nothing, stare at a 
tree, or go to sleep for an entire year. I didn't have to be friends with the villagers. In fact, I could subsidize the entire beer industry and support rampant alcoholism by giving everyone beer, if I so wished. 

In some way, Stardew kinda taught me that life doesn't have to be perfect (I know how cliche that sounds but it's true). You don't have to commit to 800 things at once and tyrannize yourself to achieve ""success"", or be best buds with everyone. Sometimes it's okay to slow down and just enjoy farming parsnips."
967,the only game with parsnips the size of your head. 10/10
968,very fun!
969,i need more hours in the day to fish. and farm. and fight in skull caverns. and give all my adoring people of the local hamlet gifts. and fish. fishing is the best.
970,this is such an epic game i really like playing it and marrying the emo girls but it makes me mad to fish pufferfish they fricking suck
971,I'll play for another 223 hours don't tempt me
972,i like this gaem
973,"too much to even put here. this game has been my comforting lover for years. everything it is, has been, and wants to be are all synergised and beautiful. it has been good to me. im looking forward to another 500 hours with it."

984,"It's hard to believe I have weeks worth of time in this game, but it still feels like the hours just melt away while playing. Your not going to be convinced by my review, you already know this is a great game that is basically the greatest modern zen garden ever made. But hey, at least this review reinforces that."
985,MMMMMmmmmmm Fish....
986,Its the best open world sandbox game ive ever played. Go at your own pace or install mod to enhance your game play :D
987,very fun and relaxing game

the music is fun, the art style is too

993,its a great game nice and calm
994,"Highly addictive, multiple play scenarios will lead to multiple saves, online, offline, co-op, solo player. Once your own your farm, you can never leave it."
995,my wife left me
996,"This game is so much fun and so addicting!! Though I will say im glad that its compatible with mods, because they enhance the experience even more."
997,.
998,"Amazing game! Honestly, it helps me disconnect after long days and transports me in a dreamy world i absolutely adore. I recommend if you like Animal Crossing games. It's easy to understand and always full of things to do! Love, love, love"
999,Play. Its very fluffy.
1000,Very fun and easy . Gives you tasks to complete when you're not sure what to do

1004,"I've got my chickens, I'm content"
1005,"My girlfriend introduced me to this game, and although I admit that I was reluctant to the idea at first, I can honestly say I've been quite addicted to the pleasant nature of the game. The pacing is great - not too fast with the progression, so it's for the long-hall. If you can commit big hours and enjoy something to play daily passively, definitely pick this up."
1006,"I want to thank ConcernedApe from the bottom of my heart for this masterpiece. This game got me through my most difficult times. It's wearing a facade of being a simple farming RPG, whilst hiding a rich world full of loveable characters, funny dialogues, heartwarming events, and hundreds of hours of content to enjoy, whether it be farming, fishing, mining, fighting monsters, or just trying to date everyone in town, I honestly would never get bored of this game. Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoy games like the Harvest Moon series, and to any other people looking for something to sink their time into. One of the absolute best games I have ever played. 10/10."
1007,calm
1008,great family game
1009,yes
1010,Good :)
1011,"Was never able to get into this game for some reason, but picked it up after I got my Steamdeck, and I’m loving it.  Great game for when you just want to relax or if you can only Palau for short periods of time."
1012,"An adorable farming sim you can loose track of time in. Lovable characters, exciting secrets, and gameplay you can take as slow (or as fast) as you like."
1013,"This is a really relaxing game and it's fun for people who like to build progress. However if you're someone who doesn't like to commit to video games this may not be the right game for you. There's also different activities for different people, for example, fishing, mining, farming, or you can collect artifacts. For people who like social games there are AI characters who you can become friends with or even marry! I think it is a very well structured and thought out game and I would totally recommend it :)"

1026,"Good game, but addictive, lol. The graphics are nostalgic, and the story lines are great, so far. I love all the different 'quests', though it can get overwhelming with so much to do. Overall, an awesome game with an amazing soundtrack. Definitely recommend, 10/10."

1041,Farming is fun
1042,its fun
1043,is fun
1044,Honestly in the beginning I was like - oh pixel art... but when I started playing it's actually really fun. The multiplayer part is the best part for me (even though single player is fun as well!) coz it's so chaotic. The combat is simple but fun especially done with more people. The farming and the raising animals are cute too! I am still going through the game ofc but it's been such a pleasant experience.
1045,"Hello, I am an average Stardew player, and this game was an experience.

I always held off doing a review about this game until I got 100% on it, but I finally did and this is what I have to say.

First off, I love this game. This game is the only game I have that has more than 100 hours of playtime, and that says a lot. Me and my sister downloaded this game and had a tremendous amount of fun on our first day. On our first day, we tried to understand the basic controls, and my sister just passed out from chopping wood, we had a big laugh about that, to this day still. I got this game at the beginning of June, and we finished throughout the entire summer. When we first got into the mines, we got really scared when a health bar showed up. Our first mining trip did not go too well. I would fight the monsters with little to no health left, but my sister focused on mining to find the staircases. Instead of finding the staircases she just would break every single rock to collect them, it was a funny experience. I never played that much off singleplayer, 90% of the game time I have was with me and my sister grinding and finding new things to do. We took about tons of screenshot when we reached the 100% cutscene, brought a tear in my eye to be honest. From chopping wood, to earning millions of gold, to me dating the entire town and flexing it.

I cannot wait what ConcernedApe has in stock for this game, and I am really excited for the Haunted Chocolatier!

On my way too download Stardew Expanded to play with my sis"

1050,There is so much  to do and I like that it is based on farming crops and animals and other things. I also like to go forging
1051,"I love stardew valley. It has a bit of a slower start, but once you friend villagers and upgrade weapons, it is very fun to play, and is pretty relaxing as well."
1052,this game I have been playing since it came out and i love seeing it grow and i just LOVE this game
1053,.
1054,"If there is an entire wiki for the game, then it's worth playing! I love growing my farm, unlocking new locations, and completing the challenges for the townsfolk. Going back to the game :p"
1055,"Stardew Valley is more fun than I thought. It has so many features, like a year cycle, gifting, multiplayer, mini-games, quests, monsters, and all sorts of things. It also is updated frequently. You can even transfer Stardew Valley Mobile data to your laptop after purchasing it on Steam. The game is amazing!"
1056,20/10! <3

Peril laid down on top of him and looked back at his still erect cock, aiming it towards her entrance. “Ready?” She asked Clay, who just nodded. Licking her lips, she pushed her vagina into his cock and began to ride him, setting her head under his chin as they both moaned.

After a while of riding, Clay rolled them over, looking into Peril’s eyes before he began to slowly thrust into her. She moaned softly. “I- it’s so big!” She moaned. “Harder, Clay!” And she soon received just that, Clay pounding her harder. “Y- you’re so fucking warm…” he whispered into her ear.

After a couple thrusts, they began to kiss, sliding their tongues in each other’s mouths as they made out. Clay rammed harder inside her, her moans being muted by their kisses. Peril pulled her head away for Clay to start kissing, which he did.

After a couple minutes of Clay pounding and making out with Peril, he finally was getting ready to cum, so he told Peril while continuing. “I want your nice warm cum in my womb, Clay!” She begged. He couldn’t just resist an offer like that, so he fucked her harder, shoving his knot inside her before filling her womb with his seed.

Clay breathed heavily as he pulled out. “Y- you were so good, Peril…” he whispered."
1063,"I have bought this game for pc, ps4, and switch. I probably have a combined 2000 hours in this game. PC is definitely my favorite way to play. I love using the nexus mods to keep the game fresh and fun. The guy who made this game is so awesome, putting out updates free of charge. You can really tell he put a lot of effort and love into making this game. Growing up I wasn't allowed to play video games, so i didn't grow up with games like this. My first game I played that I bought once I got a job was Assassins Creed. My husband however is older and this is the style of game he grew up with. I saw him playing and was like ""why are you playing a game that looks like that when we have beautiful games"". Well long story short, he got my to try it and this is our favorite game to play together. We are not Call of Duty people. We like games where we can work together in a fun and relaxing way. We have been playing this together since the game first came out, then literally together on the same farm once multiplayer came out. If your put off by the style. please give it a chance. I'm the kind of person who loves Skyrim, Fallout 4, Witcher 3, and I still love this game. If your put off by the portraits of the people, I highly recommend the DCBurger High Res portraits on Nexus mods."

1074,"I've lost any desire to grind play through the remainder of Stardew Valley. I'm in my second winter now and the thought of fishing/mining the days away feels depressing. 

I've considered just sleeping through the winter to get to the end of the year. I don't think my ""wife"" would be impressed, but that's another ""problem"" I have with the game. The NPCs haven't grabbed me like they have others. Maybe its because I played My Time at Portia first, and the animations and voice acting in that game made the NPCs feel alive.

I know there is still more content to uncover, but it doesn't feel worth the grind.

I've put 75 hours into it, so I don't know if this is ""beaten"" or ""abandoned"" but I think I'm done ""ambivalently continuing"" with it."
1075,"played this a bunch on the switch and my xbox. great ass game and I cant wait for Haunted Chocolatier to come out, this has been holding me over. I have probably a few hundred hours in total and cant recommend it enough."
1076,art
1077,its a good game
1078,Super fun game if you like farming/life sims like Harvest Moon. It also includes dungeon-esque levels in the mines where you can engage in rudimentary combat which satisfies the need for an occasional change of pace when playing farming sims. This also has the funnest and most engaging fishing mini-game I've played.
1079,good game for anti-socials' people

1085,"I find play relaxing and fulfilling. Like Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon the immediate gratification as soon as you finish a task you get reward, more frequent in the beginning but still constant in later game play. I do find the fact you need to have different load files to try to get all the achievements. Simple and fun :)"
1086,nice
1087,"very calm and fun, especially after coming home to relationship issues with your wife so you instead talk to your virtual wife."
1088,"if ur girl don't like stardew, find a new girl"
1089,"This is one of my all time favorite games. You have to just play it and find out for yourself; you won't regret it. You gotta give it a chance though. It has something for everyone. And next thing you know you'll have characters you love and ones you can't stand, just like people in real life :)) Even if farming sims aren't for you, this game has layers."

1095,i rlly love this game so much. best relaxing somehow stressful but still my favorite relaxing game!!
1096,soooo much more fun with mods i made everything pink :d
1097,"Super addicting! Yes, it can get boring when you're like me and binge 20 hours in the span of 3 days, but it's charming and I can definitely see myself getting obsessed with game.

Initially, I bought this game to hold me over until I could get my hands on a Switch and ACNH, but I'm honestly thinking that it's not even worth buying that when I have Stardew Valley. Stardew just seems like a much more engaging game to me.

There is no real end goal or time limit, so you can take all the time you want to work on your farm. There were some times when I didn't feel like dealing with my farm, so I just abandoned it for a few days and did some mining and chatting with the townsfolk. When I did return to my farm, I was able to water my crops and just go back to farming as if nothing had really happened. Maybe I got some less profit that season, but it's not like I need to hurry to make that money back anyway, After all, there is no set ending. I could take *years* to finish my farm and it wouldn't matter. I think that's what makes this game so comforting.

There is one small issue, however...

I let my friend choose the name of my farm, and now I must accept that my late grandfather's pride and joy is... ""Only Hot Babe Farm""....

yeah....

Thanks, Cosmo -_-"

1107,"simply put, this game is a masterpiece and an absolute joy to play. The soundtrack slaps, and completely matches the tone of each season in game. The co-op gameplay is a blast to play with your friends, and there are enough challenges and secrets to keep you occupied for a while. The fact that this brilliant masterpiece was created by one man alone takes it up several notched. It's 100% a love letter to those early Harvest Moon games from back in the day."
1108,Love this game
1109,Everything

Stardew Valley

Highly recommend to anyone who loves RPG, Harvest Moon type games. :)"
1118,good game
1119,"This game is super relaxing - there is so much you can do from farming, raising animals, doing quests, exploring mines, and fishing, etc. By far, my favorite mechanic is the notions of times/seasons. Using time is very important, because if you don't complete the right tasks in the spring, everything changes up when you get to summer. Both the Steam version and the phone version are easy to use and almost completely bug free."
1120,it amzon

1124,yes
1125,"Only play this game if you don't have actual responsibilities that take up a lot of time, cause you aren't gonna have any time left to do them because you'll spend 35 hours a day on this game."
1126,I would highly recommend this game. I started playing it on my switch after watching a few streamers play it and since then I have downloaded it for PC and mobile. I love the game and how many different ways you can play the game. It can be a chill game or it can be very involved and keep you busy. I only allow myself to play at certain times because this game takes over my life and once I start a new save I can't put it down. It's the perfect game for anyone who loves cozy games and needs a break from reality.

1132,"One of the best games I've ever played. Right next to Minecraft and Terraria, there is plenty to do and it is difficult to get bored especially when playing the game without using the wiki or guides. Even if you do get bored, mods and speadruning are a great way to play the game."
1133,"Love this game, played this in the first lockdown on my brothers nintendo switch, so happy to find the game and have my own copy :)"
1134,"This game started my major addiction into playing video games at age 55 (I'm now 56 as of writing this review). The different maps makes this truly replayable. The biggest challenge I have in the game is what I want to focus on the most, but I don't find that a bad thing, just a challenge.

I truly think this game should be in everyone's library."

1196," Combat your way through the Skull Caverns, Participate in community event's & goals, building friendships and courtships, exploring new places across the valley.. and seas! This game is wholesome fun, with lots of surprises along the way! More than ""just a farming sim"", though you can make it so if, you wish.

 Use your days wisely, upgrade your tools and fish! - Don't let the fishing fool you, you'll be a master in no time!"

The only huuuge minus is fishing! I don't know what's the damn problem of games developers, but they like to turn fishing into freaking pain in soft spot ruining all the joy of the games!"
1225,great game i love it
1226,"Great game 
"
1227,BEST. GAME. EVER.

1236,"If you like farms and cows, this game is for you! Well, that and other great aspects too, such as the diversified citizens with whom you can interact, the different events (although not very numerous), the online mode, the fights against monsters and much, much more! Seriously, if you're looking for a game to kick back and relax, Stardew Valley is the ideal choice!"
1237,great game something for everyone
1238,This is a very cute game that really helps pass time when you're bored I would defiantly recommend to others.
1239,farm game go brrrrrrr
1240,i love harvey
1241,"[b] Not a great multiplayer game [/b]

... if your playgroup is new to the game. Stardew Valley is one of the greatest games that beats the boring part of grinding as the game presents many ways to break the monotony of work. One of these are Heart Events, which explores the characters in town. Whenever one of these cutscenes activate, the player in part of the heart event watches the cutscenes while the rest plays normally. The time still progresses, so you have to be somehow quick with the cutscene or you might pass out. My playgroup gotten quickly bored of the game due to only weekly events working to break the pace of the game when in singleplayer heart events does the same as we opted to skip the cutscenes."
1242,soothes the soul even though sometimes the audio makes me think I secretly downloaded a horror game
1243,"I remember felling genuine happiness for a while after playing this game with my friends for the first time

Sure it's not for everyone, but if you like calm, relaxing games, I could not recommend it more.

1254,unmilled rice best crop
1255,its my fav<3
1256,Amazing game I had a great experience I really enjoy long term games and farming type games and its cool how you can kinda choose what you want to do in the game and not do only one thing. Its like if you want to do this you can do it.
1257,I've had enough of these young people... let me romance Caroline please for the love of god
1258,love it! highkey obsessed
1259,game is chill
1260,"I love this game. My play style is usually striving for max efficiency, but I am slowly learning to relax and enjoy the day. I will spend money to decorate the house/farm. I will grow flowers for gifting people. I am genuinely interested in the villagers' stories.

I spent many hours playing vanilla, and now I am spending many hours playing modded. The base game itself has great content, especially with update 1.5. And modded introduces a lot more.

In terms of value, for the price of this game, you can get many hours of gameplay out of it, which makes it worth it.
In terms of gameplay, you can strive for perfection, or roleplay and see how far you can get, or go modded. Though I would recommend playing vanilla first."
1261,relax bro and sell some crops
1262,farm
1263,my chicken didnt eat :(
1264,"not enough single women in need for a buff farmer man, wish i could marry evelyn or willy, maybe pierre too so we could make a farming empire and kill joja mart man. i also want to marry joja mart man."

1272,Good
1273,This game is very good there is endless hours of content and there is always things to do in the game!

1277,"Game has a very good and fun concept with a amazing amount of detail in terms of game-play and graphics, well worth the price. Overall a great game, 8.5/10"
1278,"One of my favorite games for multiplayer. 

Stardew Valley, or the pandemic pixel paradise. A very relaxing game to explore,farm and make friends. Give it a try. :3"
1279,"Absolutely wonderful game, perfect to sit down and relax for a while, even if you don""t have much time to play! Also it's an absolute blast to play with others, especially your significant other!"
1280,"This is soothing as hell, ong.  Don't even know what else can really be said."
1281,literally the best game ever
1282,"Don't know what i'm doing, but i'm doing it"
1283,haha silly little farm game
1284,"Are you looking for a game to play that is half passive, half aggressive intrusive thoughts?
Are you looking to co-operate, or scorn your friends for their lovers?
Are you looking for a game to play with a controller or mouse and keyboard?
Are you looking for unique music that is both delightful and horrifying?
How about a bunch of different dark story-lines behind cute pixel characters and stuff?

Yeah this is it. Get going."
1285,"It really is a game that you can just keep going back to. It can be a little overwhelming at first with all the tasks and seeing time go by on a day by day, season by season basis but just like life there is no true time limit."
1286,
1287,"The perfect, little cozy game with a lot going on and the sweetest vibes!"
1288,pretty good farming game only played it for a couple of moments but it was good
1289,"Gotta say i didn't think much of it before playing it, now i regard it as one of the best games ever made and one of the best i played. For a reason a lot of people consider the game to be really good for your mental health and mental problems like anxiety. I agree, because this game is one of the most stress relieving. Game is good in every aspect in my opinion:

1. The graphics give this retro vibe like you're playing some old game in reality you're not. 
2. The overall gameplay is chill with lots of things to do (you will always find something to fulfill your day in the game)
3. You can interact with the NPCs in a lot of ways (also you can marry one and have children)
4. You always have a goal, no matter if you complete one. You can just always create/find a new goal (as for me right now its the Golden Clock)
5. IT'S FUN (like i never expected anything in this genre to create such serotonin by playing it) 
6. You can mod the game as you like (although they're are some weird mods ngl)
7. There is lore (not that big but yeah it's still pretty enjoyable)
8. The soundtrack is calm and relaxed. Different season, different soundtrack that you're going to enjoy.

I can't find any bad aspect or some dirt to throw at. (maybe there isn't any)

Most impressive part about all of this by A SINGLE PERSON. I haven't tried Harvest Moon (nor heard about it before playing Stardew Valley), but i'm glad that it was the reason for Concerned Ape to create this Gem of a game. I recommend this game to everyone. Worth the money, Worth the time. There are other aspects and features i've missed to tell but overall it's not a good nor a great game IT""S A FANTASTIC ONE. And i don't mean fantastic only in it's genre i mean overall fantastic. 10/10"
1290,very fun
1291,Great game
1292,"this game is just cute man. thats it
"
1293,"Very casual and relaxing gameplay. You won't find highly skilled players here, but you will find relaxation."
1294,"I loved this game, it was a nice bit of relaxation and for a while I consistantly kept coming back because I legitimately wanted to work further on improving the farm.

That being said, I think I ended up playing this game too much, and focused too hard on getting that 100 % completion rather than playing for fun and relaxation. That eventually made my mood sour a bit, due to some parts starting to feeling grindy and same-samey. I regret playing that way, because this is one of the best country-life RPGs available, I love the artstyle and I [i]want to[/i] like this game. The only thing I could have done without is the combat. It's not too bad, but it's more that combat wasn't really my thing.

I still feel comfortable in recommending the game, don't let my personal experience weigh in too much if you're going to get the game or not, that's my own fault and not the game's. If this game looks at all interesting, get it, and play the way you want to, wheter that is taking your time, making the most cash, speedrunning completion, or whatever else you decide on. But however you choose to play, do it because you [i]want to[/i] and not because you feel that you [i]have to[/i]."
1295,"ye
"
1296,This game is very laid back and chill. I enjoy that it lets you do whatever you want whenever you want (to some degree).
1297,"Stardew Valley is a game that you can truly make what you want of it. It can be a chill farm simulator, a romance game, a building game, etc. It is truly something that is easy to pick up and put down too. It is intuitive and a great introduction to indie gaming if you've never done it before."
1298,Nostalgic gameplay and cute story line for a fun game.

1304,best farm simulation game since Harvest Moon gave up trying to be good in content and graphics. Lots of characters with interesting background stories (though many somehow don't have that marriage potential after all). 200h of play later and I continue to enjoy the regular updates from the developer.
1305,JUNIMO
1306,This is a really easy way to start a farm and have fun getting animals. I enjoy the pace and its a lot of fun.
1307,10/10 love
1308,"I love this game with a PASSION. I got into it because my friends were constantly talking about it, and i completely understand why."
1309,"Very relaxing with plenty of ways to challenge yourself if that's what you want from it, but it's also good for just poking through and being a li'l farmer with no worries! I love this game. <3"

The updates have included so much more content which I love! ConcernedApe is a talented individual and I can't wait to see more of his work."

1345,yes
1346,"This game is a ton of fun and a good way to pass some time. Definitely fun after multiple playthroughs if you enjoy farming games. The added element of the mining and ""combat"" is fun as well as building relationships with the townspeople. Somewhat recently, it wasn't added when I first started playing, a co-op mode was added and it makes it even more enjoyable farming with friends. I'm not an official game reviewer or anything, but it's definitely an 8/10 in my book!"
1347,good game fr

Absolute 10 out of 10"
1357,literally one of my favorite games especially with all the mods that have come out with it great job!
1358,I recommend.
1359,"I mean obviously this game is amazing. Just sit down, unwind, and relax as you enjoy the world this game offers. Stick with the game for the first season and I promise you will be addicted. 5/5 rating for me."

1374,"Stardew Valley is one of my all time favorite games, and I recommend it to a lot of people. I have even recommended it to my mom because it got ported to mobile. 
My husband originally showed it to me a few years back, and I dismissed it thinking it was just a Harvest Moon knockoff. I gave it a chance so I could play with him while he was over seas, and fell in love. I grew up playing Harvest Moon 64, and no other game has held a candle to it. Stardew is a fun stand in so I can play with my friends, and kill time on the road. I have bought it on other plat-forms I enjoy it so much!
It has a lot of things that many different kinds of people can enjoy; farming, romance, combat, mining, fishing and animals. The life-sim aspects are what I love the most, but my husband enjoys the combat in the mines. It is a fantastic time killer, and has easily manageable goals threw-out the duration of the first few in-game years. It is very addicting though, and from what I've seen that is one of the main reasons people put ""do not recommend"". I heavily would recommend Stardew to anyone who likes relaxing game play though.
My only complaints are the lack of dialog, and I wish the kids could do more.
Over all it's a fun game that has a lot more to it than you would think. If you're thinking of getting Stardew, I hope you do because it's 100% worth it!
"
1375,"ah yes, sebastian"
1376,I like farmin'. Farmin's fun.
1377,"Solid game, great multiplayer but can get really painful to connect online when users don't have an ideal internet connection"
1378,Full of joy and encouraging stuff here.
1379,This game is so much more than a farm simulator.  It's an everything game.  And the artwork and music are both so beautiful.  I really enjoy playing this game.

1412,I was addicted. Great game!
1413,"I gave a gem to Abigail and she ate it. 




10/10"
1414,"The game Stardew Valley is 100% worth purchasing. With the freedom to create your own farm and get to know so many characters, it has become one of my favourite games to play. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a calming and fun game to play."
1415,i love stardew valley!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1416,shut up and get it
1417,I will be the first to admit that I adore farming dating simulators such as the Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons. But Stardew Valley has all of them beat with how much stuff there is to do. The characters are phenomenal and the controls easy to master. Each bit of music is lovely to listen to and the ways to spend the hours playing are vast. Do yourself a favor and get this game if you love the genre! (Also you can be gay which is a major plus like no gender locked love interests is great!)
1418,"I want to say this game is relaxing but i feel like every time that clock ticks im losing precious profit and and my time is vanishing.
10/10 but clint needs to get off his lazy ass and do is job better"
1419,Great game ❤️
1420,It's fun.

1431,banger game pretty gay
1432,"Super cute game, calming, love it."
1433,"Amazing game.  Doesn't get old
"
1434,"So funny story. I thought this game be interesting because I been really hooked on necesse (def recommend getting) so I decided to buy it. Played it for like literally 11 minutes and was like nope. Refunded. Than I had a friend suggested to me and told me I prob should give it more of a shot...and here I am almost 5 hours in, forgetting that I prob should eat lunch, not paying any attention to the time, and being completely addicted to this game! 

The game starts you off with a MESS of a farm. And obviously you going to want to fix up that farm get some seeds and all that...But along the way meet people, become friends with them, and do random quests for gold. 

GOLD IS ESSENTIAL IN THIS GAME!

You will want to sell stuff like fish or farming stuff you get (but make sure you don't sell the stuff you want to craft btw) This will help you get gold. 

Now this game is a grind...Literally. I'm working on getting a coop in my farm and i need 4000 gold. 300 wood. 100 stone. The wood and stone won't be so difficult...it's the gold. There is a lot of stuff that is required with gold. You want a kitchen...10,000 gold along with 450 wood (wood being the easiest to get). 

There is literally so much more to do in this game that I could explain but it would be a longgggg review lol

If you don't mind grindy games and you're looking into finding a game that you can relax in, this is the game for you!"
1435,"I have been going through a lot of rough times in my life at the moment so I feel just like how the main protagonist does in the beginning of the story— uninspired, burnt out an overwhelmed. And just like the MC, I was hoping to find refuge from the harsh realities of the outside world in the sweet town of Stardew Valley, and boy did it deliver. Did it make my problems go away? No. Am I still an anxious ball ready to unfurl at any moment? Possibly. Does this game help me to cope and deal with all of that? Abso-frickin-lutely. Trust me when I say that this game is worth its hype— but do remember that this is a humble farming rpg at the end of the day, so do not come in here looking for intense drama or action, in fact, the lack of it is what helps make this game stress free (save for the fishing). I say, give it a try. Who knows, maybe Grandpa was right, maybe a humble life in a farm is al you need."

Yes it's a fantastic game."
1450,Yes. There's nothing to dislike about the game.
1451,"Closing in on 100 hours played and I’ve enjoyed every minute. There’s so much to do, lots to explore and mods bring even more life to the game. Would highly recommend to anyone."
1452,stardew valley goooooooooooooooood
1453,Fun And Relaxing Retro style game!
1454,"It took some time, but I found a lot of enjoyment in this game. My fiancee and I play the game together and while she's spent 115 hours (at the time of this review) and I've spent 35, we both agree the game is much better to play with another player than alone."
1455,"A very fun game to play, lots of stuff to do, fun dialogues, events etc - its a cute little immersive world :)
 - played it solo and co-op with 4 people, both ways is lots of fun:D"

1467,pretty fun game
1468,"I bought this game because I'd heard it was like Harvest Moon, and it is, but it is so much more. The graphics are nostalgic, but pretty, and the music is gorgeous! 

Stardew Valley is worth so much more than I paid for it, and the free updates with new content make it even better!"

1474,"Very enjoyable gameplay, albeit stressful at times when you are simply waking up to manage your farm all day, and end the day with 0 time or energy to go do anything else.  Once the profits start rolling in though, the dopamine soars and keeps engagement for a while afterwards.

Tons of ways to play, various improvements can be purchased/crafted for your farm, and the NPC interactions actually felt interesting enough to pay attention to (rare for me).

8/10"
1475,"This has been my favourite game for years. I've bought it on ps4, phone, switch and computer. It is a great stress undoer. It has so many different ways to play that you never have a boring day. Love this game and always will. The creator has such an amazing story to :)"
1476,farm simulator but better

1491,Yes.
1492,its good
1493,this game is sick.
1494,im addicted
1495,"Just got this game today with my own money after my older brother recommended it for over a year... ITS WORTH IT! My favourite thing so far about this game is probably developing friendships with the townsfolk and the fishing. Great game, only been playing for 4-5 hours so far but it is a hit!"
1496,It took me a while to get into it but now I love it
1497,"I am a botanist and horticulturalist and I spend most of my day tending and watering plants, so this is a great way to unwind at night with something completely different from my regular job (regrettably, my regular job lacks pixels)."
1498,It's alright.

1501,holy CRAP this game slaps and i love it and i play it a lot. i hated the controls for a long time when i got it at first but thats just cause im not used to not being able to turn on a diagonal.
1502,ye
1503,Fun and addictive! Lots to do and tons of friends to make along the way!
1504,Dumb little farm sim gives my dumb little brain serotonin. I've played over 70 hours on my switch :/
1505,So fun to play with friends. Super chill and relaxing
1506,"Cute, feel-good game"
1507,i like to fish
1508,"I like this game, its really cute"
1509,good game :)
1510,it is a good game worth 100000$
1511,Fun
1512,>
1513,"I'm addicted to this game and knowing about basically every move ConcernedApe is making now. So, yeah.

Very chill farming game, plenty to do and the mod community is outrageous. I don't think this game will ever stop being fun. If you haven't tried it yet please give it a download, you won't regret it."
1514,A good way to kill time and relax.
1515,game is good!
1516,Very Cool game
1517,Awesome awesome game :)

1526,very cute very soft
1527,haley my beloved
1528,"a fun and calming game, very fun with friends, but still fun alone. can be a bit boring in the start but gets more fun the further in you get."
1529,"The perfect animal crossing/minecraft crossover. There's always something to do and it's easy to focus on whatever part you like the most. Modding is super easy and helps customize everything. Dialog is a lot of fun between gossip, endearing moments, and characters who are just mean. It's really easy to just play for hours at a time."
1530,Pretty good
1531,"Watched RTgame play this, ended up sinking a ton of time into it. Pretty good game, a lot of very strange depth, the world starts off feeling very rooted in realism (setting and character wise, not gameplay wise), but ends up completely flipping that on its head. Very interesting, very chill. Would marry a NPC again."
1532,"Amazing game, even better with friends, something that you can spend tons of hours in with plenty to do, whether you're looking to min-max a RPG or just spent time doing whatever."
1533,great game abigail is mommy
1534,fish
1535,THE GRIND!!! never stops.
1536,"great game, I am now consumed by the urge to farm and mine and sprint my way through town blowing trashcan lids off their cans to find some bread :)"
1537,its cool
1538,its was fun lol
1539,good game
1540,"Fuck you Marnie, you ruined my pet relationship in the winter because you decided not to work on a work day. 
10/10 game, everything about it besides Marnie is amazing."
1541,This game is a very fun farming game where your can customize an entire plot of land to your liking. Mods are fun too. I think I have to fill up this whole box sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo yeah.

1547,It's a very enjoyable game. I remember there was a day I played from 6am - 6pm without even realizing it was 12 hours late lol.
1548,Amazing game! Very addicting!
1549,"i played for 5 hours straight, only reason i stopped is bc i had cheeks come over... after today i should have 10 or more hours in on it, super fun, relaxing, and lit music."
1550,10/10 i love farming games
1551,"It's the farming sim that inspired all the other farming sims (well, not really, that was like Harvest Moon or something).  It's a ton of fun and you'll lose hours of your life.  The fact that they patched in multiplayer has really destroyed any chance of this game not living forever.  If you don't have it, don't bother waiting for a sale.  You'll get your money's worth"
1552,pig meta
1553,"I was hesitant at first because of all the reviews saying its ""like animal crossing"". If i wanted to play animal crossing, i would just play it. But Stardew scratches a spot that AC just cant get. Especially newer titles, Stardew provides multiple storylines with each character and their interactions with one another. It really makes you think on how you can better the community and its residents. It quickly became one of my favorite titles. Its relaxing, yes. but if you like action - fishing and mining can be pretty intense too <3"
1554,amazing
1555,capitalism at its finest milk these cows and these people for everything they are worth v enjoyable catch some fish too
1556,Favorite game
1557,farm
1558,"this is honestly such a relaxing game, and i just genuinely like playing it when i need to take my minid off of things!"
1559,"This game is so relaxing after a stressful day. I've played this over and over again and have thoroughly enjoyed the updates and new content. I love that the author gives you the updates for free, and it's quality content that's challenging and rewarding. Plus I get to grow all kinds of crops and take care of all kinds of animals."
1560,x
1561,Great game to relax on
1562,This game... good
1563,"This game is really good. I love the RPG aspect and the fully customizable farm and character. This game is really immersive.

The combat system is mediocre at best and the townsfolk aren’t too interesting outside of their personal events. My biggest complaint is about how small the world is after you discover it. After finishing the dungeons, you’ll want new places to go.

 Luckily, Stardew Valley has a HUGE modding community so mods are always an option to improve gameplay and interactions further. 

Overall, a pretty good game, especially for the price."
1564,good game
1565,stardew has my heart.
1566,love it
1567,fun game with hot mommies
1568,Really fun game
1569,"Story rich, chilling and beautiful with a bit of magic <3*, the perfect game"
1570,The game is fun and is good for relaxing honestly. It's a chill game that has a lot of nifty little secrets that are always fun coming across or seeing others come across in their own game play. And the community is also really chill. You can pretty much anyone who they romance and have it be harmless fun. 10/10 recommend.
1571,sometimes i forget this game is about running a farm and not just a game where i can watch harvey like he's in a jar
1572,"it good.
"
1573,"is good
"
1574,"This game is anything you want it to be.
Farming simulator? Sure.
Serene nature experience? Absolutely.
Become a beloved member of your local community? Why not?
Dungeon crawler? Good luck down there!

Addictive, beautiful,  amazing value for the money. The only reason not to buy it is because you:
1. See life as a never checklist and play games the same way (though maybe this game can help with that)
2. Don't have the time to get hopelessly addicted to this game
"
1575,GREAT GAME
1576,sfsaDF
1577,Absolutely love this game I continue to come back to this game all the time!!! Also the mods off nexus is fun to add on to the game for like more marriage candidates.

1582,"Cute game. Mildly obsessed, I have it on Playstation, PC, and Nintendo switch. Very cozy, not overwhelming whatsoever. Definitely recommend."
1583,good
1584,"Highly addictive, Great when with friends.
"
1585,"my beloved. if you were a fan of harvest moon games growing up, stardew valley is a great choice. and if youre like me and you had it on switch first, playing on PC with some mods and its like a whole new game."
1586,I had the game on my wishlist for a while. I finally bought it and I think I became addicted
1587,100% perfect game to ignore your real life.
1588,"You spend your days chopping down trees and planting a bit of parsnip, until you realize you need to start buying cakes to bribe the livestock dealer into surrendering the town mayor's underpants, and then you can make best friends with a shadow monster."
1589,So much fun!
1590,Almost 1000 hours in and I regret nothing.
1591,"best and cutest game ever, me and my long-distance boyfriend play and it sparks so many new conversations and I love that we can get married in-game <3"
1592,fun
1593,pretty chill game thus far
1594,this game is the most fun game ever i recomend it
1595,Very fun and satisfying.
1596,"this game good
"
1597,play it
1598,"I checked recently and I have been playing this game for a total of 4 years now. Have been playing it since 2018 and I can't get enough, between the new updates and just overall content where I can attempt to perfect it all, it suits me perfectly.

That being said, Pierre...you are NOT THE FATHER, I have so much evidence I gathered over the years, I will die on this hill."
1599,Not a shooty shoot but it is a great game with cool mechanics and puzzles. I really like the mines. 10/10 farm game!!
1600,"Stardew Valley is just genuinely so relaxing and fun to play. The characters have great depth and personality to them, the storyline is interesting, and it's easy to learn how to play."
1601,"this game is like therapy, its so relaxing and wholesome"
1602,Perfect perfect perfect!
1603,"From being a relaxing and comfy game to being something you obsess about because you're all about that progress, baby."
1604,helps with stress
1605,Great Game
1606,"If you're old enough to remember some of the very first Harvest Moon's, especially on the PS2, this will satisfy you like Harvest Moon's endless glitches never did. Its calming, its sweet, theres endless possibilities of things to do, people to talk to, and places to explore. Its co-op as well, so my future wife and I can and WILL absolutely be cottagecore lesbians in this game, haha. Overall, amazing, and I'm wishing I had played it sooner."
1607,FUN
1608,"WHAT A FUN GAME.  THE BASIC GAME CONTENT, FARMING AND PEOPLE A TOWN AND A MINE WITH SOME GOODIES IN IT, OH AND SOME DATING.  OH AND DON,T FORGET THE MODS THAT THEY HAVE, THE MODS HAVE EVEN MORE CONTENT!.  OH I HAVE TIP THAT MITE SAVE YORE CROPS, DON,T USE YORE AXE TO HARVEST YORE CROPS"
1609,Amazing! 10/10
1610,"yuh
"
1611,"im a bisexual woman, of course i love this game 10/10"
1612,Amazing game played it on switch but finally got it on pc as well to add mods
1613,its good
1614,Its like harvest moon :)
1615,Loved it instantly.
1616,gg
1617,Has a little bit of everything.
1618,I only just found out that you can sell items to Pierre after 102 hours...
1619,Good. Really good. Buy it. It's good.
1620,"Bought this game very shortly after release and haven't stopped loving it. It's been reinstalled each time I've reset my computer. Very calming soundtrack, a game that you feel the need to play both community side and joja side. Wholesome game all around."
1621,"Finally, I have touched grass."
1622,is good
1623,"very different from what i usually play, yet i sank almost 300 hours into it.
crazy good"
1624,The people are hot. Just wish i could date the wizard ;-; and krobus rules.
1625,I made my friend gay playing this game.
1626,i love this game omg so good yes!
1627,"extremely fun game, especially if you love gathering things and a touch of romance. i'm completely addicted to this game, the only thing i would want added is been able to ask your spouse to do specific jobs around the farm. as it is you can't do that, they occasionally help out."
1628,"Become a winery, you'll make all the money."
1629,good
1630,"nice chill game, plus made by one person + respect"
1631,"calming, cute, nice dialogue :D"
1632,theres hot ppl in it
1633,"Very relaxing game! So cute and fun, love it a lot!!"
1634,"named my chicken haha cok, 10/10 would get it"
1635,"SO much content! If you're in the first three years, you're not late-game."
1636,"Stardew Valley is a fun little farming game with lots of (to me, for right now, anyway) confusing lore, quirky characters, and more ways to get your farming business up and going than you could shake a stick at. There are certainly more than a few things in this game that make it a little less enjoyable of an experience, like the day cycle being too short to get anything substantial done in the mines, and that part of the gameplay itself is quite a bore, but despite the little irritating things I seem to be discovering without fail almost every time I've booted it up, I've still found a lot more worth returning to the game for. I would give it a 7.5/10. I've had way too many issues with this game to give it any higher of a score than that, mostly in the way of mechanics rather than glitches (I haven't really encountered any) but I've had way too much fun to give it a lower rating, either, so take that with what you will. Regardless, you'll probably have already gotten your money's worth after the end of your first year in Stardew, which for me only took about twenty hours."
1637,Cool game
1638,beast
1639,I loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooovveeeeeeeeeeeeee this game.
1640,"10/10 would recocomemed
on a mission to get either haley or sam into my bed :3"
1641,Great game for losing yourself into
1642,"Probably my favorite game to ""chill"" in. The game doesn't require you to do anything, and yet, it has so much to do. Do you want to become the most lovable guy of all time and a local millionaire that uses his every single minute dedicating his time to maximize the profit? Go for it! Do you wanna chill by yourself and water your 7 plants which you named individually while sending a giant middle finger to the rest of the world? Go for it. There's so much choice, so much stuff to do and the cozy, winter-in-a-blanket-by-a-campfire type of feel it gives you by constantly hitting you with absolute bangers of a soundtrack and cute, pixel graphics is completely irreplaceable. Definitely a must buy!"
1643,good
1644,good game

1646,Much fun
1647,"Used to play 3 years ago, it was lots of fun.
2 Years ago, while in 2020 I was playing with a School-Friend, the multiplayer version. I hope we can get back on it sooner or later, have some fun."
1648,"Great game, simple graphics, simple gameplay."

1659,Keyifli zaman geçirmek için güzel bir oyun
1660,Alto juego
1661,"This is just a truly awesome game.   While most games are focusing on graphics, this game is simply fun to play.  A single game will run hundreds of hours; there is just so much to do.  The best game I have found in years."
1662,This fan-base is as awesome as this game. An over whole great game with tons of support behind it from the creator and fans alike.
1663,"Simple, well made."
1664,"Very fun and addictive game. Its imersive which I love, I Very rarely find myself getting bored (and if I do I look up things to do on youtube that I might have forgotten about). My favorite part is getting my farm looking beautiful, and finding out that you can place things just about anywhere. instead of your farm. I will be playing this game 5 to 10 years from now."
1665,mmmm
1666,"Fun and cute game. Can become addictive, so listen to your feelings and don't let playing become a chore."

1675,👍
1676,"Spending my days farming, mining, exploring and socialising with the community has got me addicted. I'm sure at this point, stardew valley doesn't NEED another review talking about how amazing it is...but it is amazing, and if steam wants a review, by golly I'll give one.
If you haven't played stardew valley yet, do yourself a favour and play it already."

1681,"If you like HM/SoS you'll like this game. The NPCs do feel quite flat in the later game once you're used to their dialogue, and it would be nice to see some updates that allow for more interaction with the children once they are born. But still a good game with heaps of playability. 

The only thing that would make it perfect is to have the ability to keep saves across platforms."
1682,The best escapism ever!!!!
1683,"Verry fun and relaxing game, ccool story. It's not just farming for those who don't know, there's an entire town you get too befriend or not, that's up to you. Verry fun with friends too. The game supports mods however not from the workshop so you will need to install a thing or two but it's verry easy. The game is really just amazing and I reccomend it too everybody to try it out!"
1684,Absolutely Spectacular
1685,it's fun to play both on multiplayer and on single player. i find it's a great way to destress and pass time. but by far my favorite thing about this game is that i have now created a character called john who is a menace to  stardew valley. we've made an entire storyline for him. he acts different in co-op and singleplayer and we've passed it as two different universes. it never ceases to entertain me
1686,im heading to the bank
1687,Epic
1688,This game is so amazing for gamers who like stuff like Minecraft
1689,"I have spent entirely too much time in this game... and I'll more than willingly spend much more time in this game. 10/10 such a great game and one of the first games I ever played on steam. It's a calming game and it's so awesome getting to know the characters. It may take a while to get a handle on things on the first farm you start, but it'll all be worth it when you get the hang of it! I more than recommend this game. The game is both the most stressful and the most peaceful game all at the same time, that's impressive. Wish there was a route to become the Wizard's apprentice, but that's okay."

1693,AMAZING
1694,"I love this game, my current save file is around 400 hours and I have yet to marry anyone showing there is more to the game then the option to romance the town people. My favorite thing to do it to save up everything my farm produces (That is either an artisan good or gold/Iridium quality) and then sell them all on winter first- the most I've gotten in one go as of yet is 4 million. It's always fun to do some winter cleaning and see the amount made completely overshoot the boxes."
1695,This game is addicting and its making me want to buy a farm in another dimension 10/10

1719,"Honestly this game is great, and so underrated! Bought it because of a friend and only played once or twice then I started playing a ton and its just awesome!"
1720,Wonderful farm sim. Nostalgia meets modern game
1721,"Reject modern life, return to pixels and farm."
1722,"I like the possibilities and the amount of things you can do, even if sometimes it gets repetitive."
1723,very good game I play it a little too much
1724,I appreciate and love this game so much <3
1725,wonderful
1726,I am admittedly and happily a cozy gamer. Stardew Valley has been my favourite game since I bought it so many years ago. I have this game on nearly every platform I have and continue to love it no matter what. It is a great introduction into cozy games and an excellent started game for younger people looking to step into games. I will always recommend this game highly
1727,good game
1728,It's quite satisfying!
1729,"The typical Stardew session ends with you telling yourself ""I'll just finish up this day, sleep (to save), then stop"". However, after saving, you'll find yourself autopiloting and walking outside, tending to your crops and animals, checking on your artisan goods. Before you know it, it's already 3PM in-game, and you'll tell yourself ""It'll be such a waste to quit right now, I'll just play the day out and stop once I sleep"". And thus, the cycle continues."
1730,No because I'm addicted. SO GOOD.
1731,VERY WELL LOVE IT
1732,it good
1733,fish
1734,GOOD
1735,Addictive and calming! Amazing game from a to z!

1737,mmm yes good.
1738,good
1739,I made poopoo while playing and used it as fertilizer
1740,"I love this game its really is in depth once u start figuring out all the hidden gems and secrets within the game!! The first year is always the hardest, but will slowly start getting better as you progress!!"
1741,it is gud especially if u have a gurl friend
1742,lots o farming
1743,great game
1744,"good game, just kinda hard to learn"
1745,This game isn't that addictive if you have experienced modded terraria
1746,Fun farm
1747,"The best resource management RPG I've ever played. I enjoy trying to organize my farm in the most efficient way possible, but there are so many different play styles from building relationships with the NPC's, to grinding for ore in the mines killing monsters along the way. I can see myself spending several hundred hours playing this on multiple different farm maps. BUY THIS GAME!"
1748,become a fishing god
1749,"It's stardew, I shouldn't have to say more."
1750,"The game you got your partner into only to not see them much anymore for the next several months.

You know what this is if you're interested in it and have played anything similar (Harvest Moon) in the past. If your idea of fun is LARPing a farmer who has to do hours of work every morning, here it is, the best example of its genre.

The co-op is where things really shine, though this game works perfectly well solo. This is probably *the* game to play with your girlfriend or younger kid if you can't get them into most other things."
1751,I love stardew - but now that I have mods it's 100x better!!
1752,this game is so cool i wish agriculture were real
1753,"Farm, steal peoples garbage, kill monster. Overall pretty nice game."
1754,nice peaceful game perfect for study breaks
1755,"cool

"
1756,"Stardew Valley might appear as a basic farming sim but underneath there is a hidden gem of a game. Developed by only one person, this game is made with soul and love and you can see and feel it while you play. 

Pros: 
- Atmosphere is calming and relaxing. 
- Gameplay has a fine line between grind and progress. 
- Friendship system and romance. The residents of Stardew Valley have a lot of personality and have heart events which promotes character development. 
- Variety of things to do, farming, fishing, mining, combat. 
- Multiple options for replayability, new farm layouts, etc. 
- Has multiplayer options and in depth option for it. 
- Soundtrack is lovely and fits for the game. 
- Bundles, which makes you plan ahead and creates self goals. 
- Seasons which spice up things with special holidays and events. 
- The developer has been pushing free updates and is usually available if help is needed. 
- The game is dirt cheap if you compare it to the hours you would put into the game. 

Cons 
- Can be a bit hard to get into the game at first. The game doesn't tell you what to do and you are on your own. You do get some mini quests that push you into the right direction but I've seen people quit before getting into the game. This can be a con or a pro for people. 

Overall, I can't stress enough how much value this game offers. It has so much soul in it and I recommend it for everyone."

1767,"i love this game so much, i played a total of 300 hours if you include the save files i have on other platform, it is so relaxing but at the same time you always have stuff to do, you never run out of things and idea to upgrade your farm and your experience, truly a great game
"
1768,This game is one I keep coming back to time and time again. It takes everything I loved about harvest moon on the SNES and builds on it. The creator keeps adding new content and I've yet to pay an additional cent. Highly recommend.
1769,"very nice
i like it

sounds are crispy and satisfying"
1770,Awesome
1771,Beautiful game and absolutely worth every penny!
1772,One of the best games in my opinion. you can play many different ways and is super fun with a friend.

1775,"Very fun, and even more fun with mods"
1776,honestly i love this game
1777,good game
1778,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
1779,W game
1780,This game is literally my favorite!! Granted it too me a months to a years of convincing by my best friend and brother x'D but I really recommend people to play this game!!
1781,good we played so long
1782,"I love this game! For the price the amount of content you get is absolutely insane. I also played other farming simulation game that cost me way more and none of them had this much in them. 

I will say, I absolutely hate the fishing mechanism, that is the only things I don't like (but I think it is just a me problem and I am doing just fine without fishing much). You also get in the game without instruction or anything, so you might have to do some googling, but it is not the information that is missing on this game! The community is amazing and you will find what you are looking for somewhere. 

I thought the art would be a problem for me, as I usually like non pixelated/better graphic/art. but I learned to love it and the character are very expressive, even in that artstyle. 

For the price, the fact that one person program this, this game is a 10/10 in my book and I will play a lot more!"
1783,"Its really fun and addicting, i really love it
"
1784,a blast
1785,good for just a nice relaxing time gaming no stressing and i love it
1786,This game is AMAZINGGG. Essentially it's a farming game. Oh whats that? You dont like farming? Go to the mines! You dont like mining? Create friendships/relationships with the town! Youre not a people person? Then theres many other plots and secrets you can go do!! Fun for playing alone or with others. I love this game so much <3
1787,love my little anti-capitalist capitalism simulator <3 <3
1788,"Wholesome, funny slice-of-life, with farming fufillment. Hot people to date and marry. What more could you want???"
1789,Love this game! I have this on my PS4 and have poured far more hours on there than here. I'm working on catching up on here.
1790,good shite
1791,Easily one of my favorite games im so addicted
1792,me can marry 2d men nyum nyum
1793,Honestly not usually a fan of these types of games but this one surprised me... I give it 11/10 junimos
1794,"Played this game before the craze, started around 2017 and there has been so many changes and updates. I remember first playing this I felt like I was in another world and time did not matter. So if you want to play a game that terraforms (i spelt that wrong) and love ACNH which is similar. You will like this :)"
1795,very relaxing and methodical
1796,"Stardew Valley is such a joy to play- I often get so caught up in my farm that I forget time is passing in the actual day too. Only MINOR complaint is it's not cross-platform, so I can't team up to build a farm with my buddies who own the game on Switch."
1797,It is a pleasant farm simulator with aspects like monster hunting and mining to keep it from growing stale.
1798,"Great game to kick back & relax, or go hard & try to complete all the objectives if you wanna go that route. Love playing it w/ my GF. Don't really enjoy playing it on my own, as an FPS player."
1799,güzel oyun
1800,"Muito bom e é digno de aplausos o fato de uma pessoa sozinha ter feito um jogo tão divertido e satisfatório. Entretanto, acredito que a integração nativa com sistemas como a oficina da steam seria extremamente benéfico, uma vez que, no estado atual, a instalação de mods é um processo desnecessariamente inconveniente.

Fora isso, o jogo é ótimo e merece todos os elogios possíveis."
1801,"On my Switch I bought 7 wooden swords and my friend got mad at me :(  

100% would do it again"
1802,I enjoy playing this game.
1803,planty
1804,Love it. Your not gonna regret bying it.
1805,"The majority of my time playing was without mods. It's super fun and you really have to work hard to slowly level up your farm etc. I suggest trying the game for how it is before adding mods. 

ps. don't be friends with Lewis lolol"
1806,"Its a fun game,really good made and i would recommend it."
1807,"Give people free stuff so they like you, just like in real life."

1827,im mad
1828,"nice music
fishing is fun
chill game"
1829,"I love this game. I play it a lot when I need to recharge. Aside from the occasional spouse running off into The Void because you blocked their path to bed, there are very few glitches (but honestly, that's what gives the game its charm). I've downloaded a few mods and it seems to be functioning well with those with little extra glitching."

Sometimes though it feels like it’s a little slow especially during the winter the first few years. And even beyond the first few years there’s some boring stuff. 

Overall I recommend !! It’s very fun and cute :)!"

1846,"Best, most relaxing game ever."
1847,"I have owned this game for a few years now, and though I go through my spurts of playing it and not playing it, this game has always been nothing but enjoyable to me.  The game is extremely fun, and you can make it what you want it to me.  The NPCs are all distinct in their respective ways, the various skills/activities within the game keep you busy, and the community surrounding this game is second to none.  This is hands-down my favorite game since picking it up in 2019."

1872,My absolute favorite game. Played it for months on xbox and now im gonna keep playing it on PC <3 . Very easy to mod as well.
1873,"A great game that is a wonderful stress reliever and one you can put down and get back into very easily if you're that kind of gamer.  I love the fact that you can play the game at whatever pace you want and other than quests and change of seasons for crops, there's no time limit to complete things/gain more experience.  Very varied gameplay so you can't be bored and is a great RPG for someone who isn't experienced in gaming."

1889,"Genuinely one of my top 3 favorite games. The graphics, story, and overall game is amazing, and is very replayable. When you think you've only been playing for 1 or 2 hours, it turns out to be 5 or 6 instead. Also, the modding community for this game is insanely huge, and has tons of quality of life improvements, custom art and music, and for mods like Stardew Valley Expanded, basically a whole new game, for free!
10/10. Definitely buy."
1890,It is a good game I play for a long time I started when nintendo had a game trial for stardew valley in 2022 then I bought the full game for switch then for pc and I got more hooked to pc than switch because of mods
1891,good time
1892,ok
1893,"Everything about this game is great! the story, the game play, all the mods you can get! i truly love this game it's one of my top 2 games to go to when i want to play something relaxing."
1894,"Stardew Valley has been one of, if not my favorite game for about 4 years running. I have always been into cozier games and Stardew Valley has always been one of my top recommendations. I've introduced this game to several people and highly recommend playing with friends. Every aspect of this game is a joy to play through from decorating your farm and building relationships to longer adventures such as figuring out the secrets of the valley. This game has so much to discover and explore giving you plenty of hours of playtime. Thank you ConcernedApe for making such a stunning game and I can't wait for more to come!! <3"
1895,"Really fun game - when I was a kid, I played Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town on the GameBoy Advance, and I really enjoyed it. Stardew Valley is peak Harvest Moon; beautiful sprite graphics, deeper mechanics that I initially though, plenty to do and collect.

You can forage for wild plants, plant fruit and vegetables on your farm, plant fruit trees, have animals such as cows, chickens, etc. You can fish, mine, help your neighbors, upgrade and decorate your farm in multiple ways. The weather affects how you're gonna go about your next day, there's various events and festivals in town that you can participate in. I highly recommend it!"
1896,"I thought about making a cheeky ""I hate this game, would not recommend (500 hours played)"" type of review. but there is nothing I can criticize about this game while maintaining a clean conscience. 

This game has scratched an itch in my soul that yearns for something which I can't articulate, and which I may never fully understand in my lifetime. 
10/10, please buy or trick someone into buying it for you."
1897,"MMMM YES VERY GOOD
"
1898,"In over 30 years of life I've achieved education, jobs and cars.

In under 30 hours of stardew valley, I have a profitable, productive farm, a wife, friends, kids on the way and have learned to fish, mine, craft, cook and slay monsters.

I'm living the life I always wanted in pixels now. 100% recommended."

1915,"I have so far devoted 60+ hours into this game and to be honest, i don't regret it at all. Everything about this game is fun, relaxing, alive and great. A single guy made all of this and is actively listening to his community and being apart of it showing his dedication and love for this game. The mod support is amazing, the level of customization you can bring out if the base game isn't enough is absurd in a good way. This game is a masterpiece and I cannot wait to see what concernedape has to offer in haunted choclatier next"
1916,"Basically 8-bit ACNH, still a great game super fun with friends"

1920,"I am a 40 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing Stardew Valley and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching black women twerk on Tiktok. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, chose a server, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
1921,Wonderful!!
1922,"FARMING, MINING, MODS!!!!
this game is pog"
1923,My absolute favorite game!
1924,i love fishing minigame
1925,is good
1926,fun old school game.
1927,A joy to play
1928,epic
1929,I like the game a lot. It's cozy and really fun when you play with others. Also a good Idea for a cozy Date Night.
1930,This game is a very relaxing game. it's a good way to destress after work. I love everything about the game. Only thing that I dislike is the fact that you can't raise your health besides leveling up your combat skill.
1931,such an inspirational game in the indie gaming industry
1932,Calming.
1933,"stardew is one of those games that start off slow especially if you're restarting from a previous play-through but once you get past that it is 100% worth it. it can be enjoyed multiplayer and single player and is super relaxing and therapeutic while still giving challenges to keep you interested and involved. i love watching 100% completion videos on youtube and from there you can easily see that hundreds of hours can be put in this game. if you have a need for a farming sim this is totally it.

if you're more of a person who enjoys action and being under ""stress"" in games i would do your research before buying this. some of my friends find it boring which is perfectly understandable."

1937,"I AM THE MASTER FISHER. fishing is my passion. ever since i was born on a pirate ship i always had this immense connection to the ocean. my mother birthed me in the captain's quarters, a raw and real unmedicated birth. her name is mary, as in the virgin. we later moved to a small port town in japan, where we often spent our days strolling along the white sand beaches of japan. sometimes, i would play in the water, and wonder wow. how many fish are there in the ocean? at the ripe age of 9 years old, i asked my mother if she could take me back to the pirate ship where she gave birth to me. she said, ""son, when you grow up, will you be the savior of the fish's souls whomst youve harvested?"" i said yeth. i then went on to become a world-class fisherman. I would say stardew valley encompasses my childhood story and my success in the fishing industry.


 graphics? amazing. gameplay? smooth. pace? perfect. playtime? never-ending. enjoyability? out of this world. hotel? trivago.
best game ever. get this game if you want a girlfriend. i dated the blonde chick who hated me and then she didnt hate me and i was happy :D. i love when girls are girls. love, bae ludic. army forever! i purple you."

1944,"I played Stardew Valley a lot on my iPad a few years ago, and was excited to find out there was a new update - and that I could play it with a friend or family member. My young adult daughter and I are having good quality time together playing SV in a co-op situation. I love the flexibility of the co-op - it gives each of us more time to focus on the parts we really like, and we switch off once in a while. Such an endearing game - it astounds me that one man was behind all of this. I think he's a creative genius, but also has a gift for telling stories about flawed characters in a kind and sensitive way. Very uplifting. :)"
1945,An all around outstanding game. One of if not the best of it's kind.
1946,Super chill and fun.
1947,"it's a very good game,  I had a lot of fun playing, 5 out of 5 stars."
1948,Can marry an alcoholic
1949,I have more friends in this game than in real life

1952,Very good!
1953,Stardew Valley is the Dark Souls of video games
1954,Great game which has great gradual progression that makes it fun to see your farm grow more advanced over time
1955,Literally the best farming simulator made by one guy
1956,"stardew valey

1957,"Great farm/relationship sim with so much replayability. Concerned Ape's support for the game has also made it super fun to play. Even though we might be at the final version of SDV, would still recommend 100%"
1958,Fun farming simulator with other things to do! Would definitely recommend to people who want to have a fun time just exploring a new town along with a smooth progression
1959,"super chill awesome game, i like to pair it with some music in the background"
1960,you cant marry the grandpa
1961,nice to play after a long day
1962,I'm addicted to this game. I've finished over 300 hours on the switch and have a save file that is 96% perfect lol. This is the only game that I own on 3 platforms because I love it so much.
1963,"It is a calming and relaxing game ever since I first played it, even though i took a slight hiatus from it for a bit in the past because I wanted to try and get off gaming for a bit coming back its always a pleasant start back up. It also kind of calms you from any highly competitive or nerve wracking situations virtual or reality"
1964,"I really enjoy playing Stardew Valley.  It is an addictive game that I have over 420 hours in at the time of writing this review.  Stardew Valley is entertaining no matter how many times you play it and I think it is the best farming game that you can get.  I'm excited for the release of Haunted Chocolatier, CA's next game."
1965,"This is an amazing game
i would anyone to play with a friend or significant other"
1966,"Really nice and cozy game, great for relaxing."
1967,"I love how the 1.5 update can finally come out. I have been playing for years on my tablet and this new update is phenomenal. I will say, if you've been playing for a while on mobile it will be a bit hard to get used to the controls. I'm still getting used to it. I hope this can show other people to buy this. And of course, I am not forcing anyone. And, again, I hope other people will see this and consider buying it. This game is amazing, and I would love to know that others are playing it as well."
1968,"this game is so charming and cute, with so much to do and so many different ways to play. it's a choose-your-own-adventure that you can play at your own pace. very relaxing and fun, couldn't recommend it more!"
1969,fun game with way more to do then you relize. bit of a grind by yourself but worth it.
1970,"I own the game on both PC and Switch and have over 200 hours in it across both. Stardew was one of the few things that really kept me going through my period of unemployment in 2020, and I routinely return to it when I need to re-center myself. Also Sam is best boy. I know everybody loves Seb, and I do too, but Sam is just better than everyone else."
1971,fun
1972,"Very good, lovely game."
1973,"best cozy game, its super funny but still has its challenges"
1974,great game

1978,very fun
1979,I LOVE THIS GAME
1980,"This is just a great game you can sink hours into, and be glad doing so. It makes you feel like a kid again. Discovering everything, stumbling onto something cool by accident, relaxing to the wonderful ost. Did I mention it was developed by one person?"

1982,vegable

1984,"All possibilities, no real consequences. Pure gaming."
1985,"This game has a little bit of everything for everyone. Farming and fishing for the casual player, combat for those who enjoy some action, and crafting for the creative types. It runs very well plus the story and music are as charming as the locals in the town itself."
1986,I love this game
1987,This game is the perfect game to escape reality. simply a silly little farmer growing silly little crops.

2024,"It is, by far, one of the cutest farming-simulator games out there. It got me through quarantine."
2025,"Great game, really. You'll easily spend days on this game, and the co-op works great with up to 3 other friends.
In my 215 hours of gameplay, I think I noticed all of like 1 glitch/bug, which wasn't game-breaking, so the game is pretty good, compared to some other indie games, that often have problems with bugs here or there, that doesn't get fixed.
The characters are interesting, once you get to know them throughout the game, they're fleshed out and not as 2-dimensional as they might initially come off as.
Get the game on sale, and you'll easily get your money's worth of gametime."
2026,A fun game to spend time with friends I have no friends
2027,"Very pleasant game, and keep finding fun new elements. Very pretty, and easy to run on smaller systems like tablets etc."

I enjoy so many of these romanceable characters, however my only downside is I wish the portraits were a little more updated, but that can easily be fixed with a portrait mod <3"

2039,Buy it its amazing
2040,"If you are thinking of buying stardew valley but don't know if you will like it or not here are some of the things that are good about it (no bad things). 1. One of the most relaxing games out there, of course sometimes its not so relaxing but most of the time it is. 2. Its fun with friends or without. 3. The animals are the most adorable things in a video game ever. 4. Do you not have a gf/bf in real life? Well then, get married and have kids in game! 5. Its really easy to make friends in this game if you don't have any in real life. Notes: i have only 80 minutes because i played this game mostly on my switch."
2041,"This is one of my favorite games of all time - it's fun, it's interesting, the storyline is good, there is character development, there's a lot to do and I have played it through multiple times and still find it entertaining. 

There is a learning curve at first and it takes some time to figure out the quirks of how to play but once you have it down it is so enjoyable!"
2042,amazing
2043,how can i stop being addicted ples i need to pass uni
2044,"Couple of mins in game and I’m already loving it. I must say this game is really helpful for me after a stressful match of being a medic main and keeping everyone alive and them spamming e all the damn time, this game really keeps me sane after all the times I Uber them and end up charging in like an idiot or ignoring a lvl 3 sentry just to chase down 1 scout. Thank you for this game man."

10/10 would buy again"
2065,I lOVE this game!
2066,"Rating: 10/10
Has become one of my favourite games, easily. You loose track of time because you tell yourself, just one more day. The way you play is completly up to you, focus is up to you. There is a story but you don't have to follow it. If you love easy going relaxing games, this is for you.

Graphics: 8/10
Pixelated and adorable! You can tell what is what without an issue, except for in the dark but that might just be my screen.

Music: 9/10
Very nice background music, you can always adjust it in the pub through the jukebox.

Story: 8/10
I am personally  not following the story at the moment but from the bits I caught, it seems fairly interesting. Every character has their own thing going on, building relationships and discovering the town secrets can be fun if that is for you.

Controls: 7/10
Very easy for the most part. Walking is quite slow though even when you run. Using the garden hoe and watering can is a little annoying sometimes but managable."
2067,"no thoughts, just farm."
2068,totally relaxing!
2069,I love it! Its a great game.

2084,"Stardew Valley is definitely my favorite game. When I started playing it, I was like man this is so awesome, then new things kept happening and still do and i've never had a dull moment playing. it doesn't give you the chance to get bored of it. There's constantly more to do and so many more cool things being unlocked and backstory and secrets being uncovered. It takes actual skill and strategy and it's enjoyable that me and my bf can both play and have played the same amount but it all depends on what you do, who you get close to, and what tasks you focus more on. This is such an amazing game and $15 is so cheap compared to the joy and so many hours of fun you'll get from the game, but be ready to get addicted to it quickly and for weeks at a time."
2085,"It is the one game that made me play games in the first place, it is wondrous in it's simple way, always something to do and explore. And the creator has added patches after patches which means that the game is never outdated. 10/10, would reccomend."

Don't get me wrong, the interactions with the NPCs are really great.
But if you married someone, wouldn't it be nice to have a heart event on the wedding day or on anniversaries like first year, 5 years, etc.
I think it's great and I hope I'm not alone in the community.

It gave me alot of good memories. it has alot of stuff you can do on it. and its really fun and sometimes it takes you hours to figure out certain stuff if you wont use guides on youtube of course xD Anyway  The game is really good id suggest buying it and the storyline is pretty good. I hope you have fun! :D  my friend suggested i should get this game. i do not regret it.
2179,"I've played this game for 200+ hours. It is amazing and so much fun. The npc's are really cool and I'm looking forward to marrying Maru, there's many backstories for different npc's and I love finding new dialogue too. I also enjoy completing the community center and also being the worst person ever and going the joja route. anyways, overall this is my favorite game and even 200+ hours in I'm still discovering new things. 

Thanks for reading this:D"

2181,"super chill
really cute
if you want a cute game i REALLY recommend it!!!"
2182,"I grew up playing Harvest Moon games on my PS1, PS2, GBA and then DS, but none of the games afterwards could grasp the feeling of those games until this game came out.
Since this game I've played Story of Seasons on the Switch and while an excellent experience I feel this one provides the ultimate ""Harvest Moon"" feeling and I think everyone should buy this game on whatever platform you may own. (I've currently got it on Steam, PS4 and Switch)

The game plays beautifully on iOS and Android Devices if you've paired it with a Controller and play through Steam Link. But if I didn't have that option I'd have definitely bought them on iOS and Android as I use both via Phones and Tablets. (and probably still will)"
2183,This game is about you as a farmer
2184,It cured my depression.
2185,i love stardew valley its a big comfort game for me

2200,"This game is very good game for my opinion. 

it's very fun to play and on the first 3 years u have always what to do.

but i think the game need some more updates and improvments to be 10/10 

but i think i will give to this game 7.75/10 for now.

beacuse the co-op is broken, and the game need more updates to be perfect.

good day :)"
2201,Amazing game and also has a big modding community
2202,You're kinda doing the same thing a lot of the time and i get bored after a little

2207,Like crack but cute
2208,one of the best games i found to just turn on some music and perform brainless activity
2209,10/10
2210,Amazingly chilled game
2211,"Most relaxing and enjoyable game I've ever played! There's just something so satisfying and exciting about watching your crops grow every day; fishing as a fisherman on the lonely rainy nights, selling your crops and fish to afford upgrades to equipment to do the job better and faster.  

[b]Pros:[/b] It's really addictive. Easy to learn, good controls, great soundtrack, interesting characters, easy to put down if interrupted, and a good amount of depth considering simplicity. Frequent updates from the developer, Lots of secrets.

[b]Cons:[/b] It is really addictive. It only ever saves when you sleep (After having the IOS/Android version, they made a save system that keeps where you are mid-day if you close the game.), It gets repetitive after a while. 

Even 390 hours altogether with my other account with ten in-game years, I still feel like I have so many mysteries to discover. Overall I highly recommend this masterpiece."

2230,chill game
2231,yes
2232,this game is my only source of serotonin 10/10
2233,"Stardew Valley is surprisingly addicting, and is very fun to play. Honestly i find the most joy in the mines, seeing how deep it goes, and fighting the monsters, getting stronger, it's genuinely fun. Another thing i enjoy is fishing. Fishing is fun, and serves as a great source of success. It is well made, and the complexity of the game  is impressive. I will apologize for not being that good of a reviewer, but just know i really did enjoy the game, and will continue to do so."
2234,Very good game.....

2242,"This is the most fun. The stories you make, the music. Autumn. The most fun."
2243,"Pros
- great characters and world/lore
- beautiful soundtrack and pixelated graphics
- endless amount of hours

Cons
- can be overwhelming at times -- there's so much to do
- no ""easy"" mode
- some activities can be repetitive after a while"
2244,Yes.
2245,Not always the easiest to figure out where quest items are located. But It was a really enjoyable game. First game I have beaten in a few years.
2246,this was a beutiful game if you didn't already play it just look at how good the story line is
2247,Cute and relax game !
2248,pls add sex
2249,"So I put 22.2 hours into it within the first week of obtaining the game. Slow start, but picks up quite quickly by maybe the second season? I think, whilst realistic, having no crops available for winter is a bad move. It made the game so tedious and trying, and it's where I put the game down. 

IDK, Maybe when I pick the game back up again I might find it gets better, but until then I'm gonna leave it a few months. By the time I come back to it I'm just gonna start fresh"
2250,good game
2251,why the hell is it so hard to fish
2252,"Lovely game! You can concentrate on being a farmer, adventurer/miner/ or fisherperson. Or you can do all 3! Romance up to 6 female and 6 male characters. Marry and have children! Decorate your farm as little or as much as you want. This got me through the darkest days of lockdown in 2020. I am still playing it more than two years later. Easy game to have multiple play throughs."
2253,great game
2254,This game is an absolute blast to play. 100% would recommend!
2255,"Fun environment, lots of entertaining stuff to do."
2256,you can be gay. 10/10
2257,I know this isn't healthy but I CANNOT put this game down. I have it on pc and my switch and I have not gotten bored once. I have absolutely no complaints. I've recently replaced the sims 4 with Stardew for various reasons and I could not be happier. I'm three years in on one of my saves and the story line has not stopped! I am beyond impressed by the devs of this game. Great work and can't wait to see what other games these creators come up with!

Tho I do wish there was more story to the NPCs- like there are only so many cutscenes, and when you get to a certain point there's not really a story there (cause if you go for completion you know). The undateables don't even have as much of a story as the dateables do. Regardless I've enjoyed it, tho if you want more story I'd recommend mods :)"

2269,"I love my emo husband(Sebastian), the game is really fun tbh.  I hate our daughter tho, she just stares at me with those beady demon eyes.  Our son is normal tho.  I think the base game content is great + it's easy to add mods if you want to!"

As a kid I couldn't find myself getting into it because I didn't understand what I needed to do just yet- but years later I went back and figured it out. I am glad I did, this game is great and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing as a musician."
2276,"if you had a life before this game, you can forget about it! this game will be what you live breathe now. :) youll find yourself playing this game instead of sleeping eating or going outside, you dont have friends anyways so thats solved too! i played on my friends account before this, i had about 96 hours on that account :D"

2280,"Great relaxing farming game, very fun when able to play with friends with multiplayer/online option"
2281,"Stardew Valley is one of those extra special gems. It's a passion project that (at the time of writing) has been in active development for nearly a full decade, which should be more than enough to attest to how much work and love has gone into making it the best it can be. It was already an excellent game when it first released back in 2016, and it's stunning to see how far it's come over the past six years. The official content patches are impressive enough, and the modding community for SDV is absolutely incredible. If I had to pick one and only one video game to play for the rest of my life, Stardew Valley would be one of the top candidates."
2282,"Nice game ! Chill gameplay, good music, cool relationships and cute 2d pixel graphisms. It can get repetitive after two or three years but mods can refresh the game. Just better than Animal Crossing : you can mod the game, fight big corporations, date a based frog-lover emo boy or live a cotagecore life with forest spirits. Just play this if you are a salty player, it will calm you down a bit (or go touch some grass, idk)"
2283,"it's really good but addicting. I spend 12 hours getting 1 achievement, it was to help the bad corporation. I felt so bad I had to create a character named Karen and to be a bitch to everyone just to make myself not feel bad."

2290,"I once played the mobile version for 24 straight hours... on a plane flight to australia. There is so much to do and build and find, and the game is a grind, but an enjoyable grind. Hopping on stardew is always a blast."
2291,I love this game so much so that I have it on all platforms!
2292,Very sweet and has lots of content. Very relaxed and fun!
2293,If you want to isolate yourself from this cruel world. Stardew Valley is perfect game for you.
2294,It is a fun do what you want
2295,"When I first saw this game I thought it looked unique and nice, especially with the pixel graphics so I went straight to reviews and read someones comment about how this game feels like a hug. I was sold straight away and got it. In fact I can agree that this game feels like a hug, more of a fuzzy blanket wrapped around your brain even, So cozy and so relaxing. As of writing the review I have about 32 hours of gameplay and I haven't even discovered a third of the game. It's also a time eater, everytime I say ""I'll just fish for 10 minutes"" I check my current session and got 120 minutes there, so beware. If you think about getting it, DO IT!"

2319,"Great game, would recommend to basically anyone."
2320,"Honestly in love with this game! Getting to know all of the characters is my favorite thing about the game, especially since the you can potentially pick a partner. It might be a slow start at first but it's still to addicting to play."
2321,very relaxing
2322,"Its an amazing game with so many unique things to explore and interesting tasks to complete. This game never let you bore especially when two players are playing. Also the scale achievement of different categories like mining, fishing, farming etc push you to do better and more & more. Great game Thank you"

2329,v fun and cute! one of my favourite games (⸝⸝ᵕᴗᵕ⸝⸝) ♡
2330,"Stardew Valley has become my go-to game for when I just need to relax and take my mind off the real world. The mechanics can take a little bit to get used to, but you quickly get into the swing of things to build up your farm and explore the town and it's secrets.
I always have something to do in the game and can while awhile hours tending to crops and doing town quests whilst listening to the soundtrack.

Highly recommend picking it up, and think it should be a staple of everyones game library."
2331,Relaxing and satisfying.
2332,yay
2333,"Love this game, it's perfect! I will never get tired of this game, there's just so much to do and master"
2334,Stardew Valley as a game captured something in me that even as a city girl made me yearn for something beyond the four walls i find normal. This game plays with your sense of time in how it draws you into a world that... well... you can see yourself making a difference in. A world that does hint at the grit in our lives but gives a chance to... to live out a fantasy that gives you control to make things better. This game appeals to that yearning to be a better person and to make a better world for those around you.  I hope you also find the same love in this game i did.
2335,Stardew Vally is a very relaxing game.

2339,One of the best games out there. If you're looking for a comfort game this is it!
2340,"Amazing game. So much content it's hard to believe one guy did it all by himself.

If you like Harverst Moon, get this. If you like chill games, get this. If you have a group of friends who likes to play multiplayer games, get this. If you like games with customization(both character and farm), RPG mechanics and good progression, get this.

Actually, screw all that, just get this game regardless. It's a masterpiece."
2341,"I grinded over 100 hours in a dungeon for a cowboy hat to dress up as Clint Eastwood
best 100 hours I've spent in any dungeon
oh yeah you can farm too i guess"
2342,yes
2343,Cool game but the devs give next to no updates leading to a boring game after you have completed everything (basically after you first play through)
2344,"Nothing new to say here. This game is fantastic if you want to wind down after work or want to go hard and try perfecting all aspects the game has to offer. Or anything in-between. Though, if someone could make a mod specifically for a guy selling cabbages and having a certain iconic quote after something happens to said cabbages... That would be icing on the cake (I'll definitely be playing Haunted Chocolatier if it's similar to this game)."

2360,"Truly Amazing. You can build your farm and design it as much as you want, with different farm types to choose from. I use a beach farm because I thought it looked cool. (Big mistake) You can get and use many weapons to defend yourself in the mines. It may be boring at first- until you invite friends! You can now farm together. Also, there's marriage and you can have kids in this game, though I haven't done that yet. I recommend this game- especially if you have many friends!"
2361,"i dunno what to say, the game was fantastic allowing user to make and use the mod"
2362,Haha clearing all the wood and stone from the farm go brrrrrrrrrrr
2363,Its a little addicting..
2364,only just started seems like an alright game
2365,"Never have I been more surprised at a game than Stardew Valley. What I thought I was getting into was a relaxing, basic farming sim. What I got was an incredible world with great characters, and so much more to do than simply tending a farm. It kept me always busy and entertained, so much so that I've poured in more hours to this than any other game I have. For a measly price, it is an incredible game that everyone should experience."

2406,"This is a very fun fairly calming game (sometimes it can be stressful) that is a semi-simple farming simulator. The characters are really well written with each one having their own likes, dislikes, and heart events; it makes them complex which is really nice. There are plenty of fun events to take part in like each end of season event. There is plenty of replay-ability; you can make multiple saves on different maps (each one having it's own perks and challenges), romance different people, and customize your farm (and character) however you want. I love Stardew valley and definitely recommend it to anyone else who likes a chill game that they can play over and over again."

2417,Excellent experience. I recommend modding it on your second play through to enhance the experience.
2418,Played a ton on console already and decided to get it on steam so I can mod it. Loved it on console because its a nice peaceful game that has a lot in it. If you end up modding it with some of the amazing things people have made for this game it becomes a masterpiece.
2419,All around great game
2420,The game is amazing and addictive. I've played so many hours just taking care of a farm and fishing and talking to the villagers. Love it!
2421,abigail do be kinda nice tho
2422,it's a nice vibe out game
2423,"Simple farming game, with very in depth characters and stories. Relaxing experience."
2424,very poggers game it runs on my chromebook which is great because i want to play it on every device possible
2425,Great game. I love it sooooo much. Definitely recommend
2426,"This game is pretty awesome especially with my buddy clutchbaseball 
Now a continuation on cottage cheese 
you see cottage cheese is also a food where you can mix it with other foods and it'll taste pretty epic 
for example 
the cottage cheese can be used as a dip for crackers and chips 
a great item for parties 
the cottage cheese i'm currently eating is a 9.3/10 and this game is a hilarious 10/10
thank you clutchbaseball 
btw
don't forget to let me know about your cottage cheese moments in the comments 
Thank You"

2434,"I absolutely love this game. It lets me live out my farming dreams, living in a small little town with a small population, doing my own thing on my own farm. This game has everything: farming, love, mining, combat, fishing. Even the lore is interesting! ConcernedApe did such a great job with this game. I will forever cherish it (and forever play it!) 100/10 and I recommend it!"
2435,"I really can't express how amazing this game is and has been over the years. I got this game around when it first came out, and it was fantastic at that point. Being able to come back over and over to see the myriad of new things that the hard work of Concerned Ape brought was actually so amazing. I've never had better value for my time and money. Thank you for making an amazing game that has only improved and spoiled us to what other producers/companies have/will give us"
2436,"shit slaps hard, thought i was gonna hate it cus ive tried it on my friends switch and got board real quick but plot twist i was just to dumb to know how to play the game and now i cant stop playing  it"

2452,"I've played this game since it came out and years later i'm still playing it, so many new updates and fun, new, exciting things to do, Plus making friends with the towns people, you get to receive gifts and just have fun with it. I love the game and i would recommend this game to anyone and everyone."
2453,Very fun game. Easy to lose real life time on.

2455,"I initially didn't Pick up this Game because I don't like Farming Games. Then My buddy Bought it for me and He says ""Come on, were playing it"". And I'm like ""Fine, but if I'm not feeling it were switching"", and He said ""I'm not worried"". He was right. To call this a farming game isn't fair. This game has sooo much more layers to it than that. Theres never not something to do in this game, between farmiing (Which I actually very much like in this game) fishing, foraging, crafting, Interactive town festivals, you always are busy. But at the same time its ALWAYS relaxing. You steadily over time make friends with the citizens of the town and little by little getting to know a little more about them each time. It's not ""I need one head of cabbage"" followed by ""We are now best friends, I will now share my innermost personal feelings"". And there's multiple maps and ways to play the game. Bored of vegetable Farming? Run a Vineyard or Brewery? Tired of that? Animal husbandry and make milk and egg products. Even a Fish Farm is a thing. Bottom line Whatever your reservations try this game."

2467,This is such a well made game. Very balanced and fun to play. I originally played on the Switch then I played the mobile version. I recently got it on the PC to try and dip my toes in modding. It has been a lot of fun doing some new stuff and getting to see the bigger maps and meet new NPCs.

2496,"really fun and relaxing game specially after a tough day
"
2497,"Didn't think I'd like this game, but it has a little something for everyone. Pretty solidly goal oriented for a sandbox game (achievement hunting helps). Found myself sucked in as soon as I got started. I think this is the type of game everyone should try, especially if you have some friends to play with."
2498,"Such a fun and relaxing game with LOADS of content. Just when you think it's coming to an end, there's more to do. HIGHLY recommend."
2499,Fun game. Me am farmer. Can do many things. Very fun.
2500,"I started playing this game about 5 years ago off an on. This year, we moved into our first house with our three bery young kids, and now they get to watch me tend to a real garden and eat fresh produce. Play the game, you'll probably find something to love about it, and if you lve something about the game, try it in real life.

Two thumbs up."
2501,Absolutely loved it
2502,"absolutely love this game.

i honestly thought it was another simple farming sim, but to my surprise there´s actually quite a bit of lore and somewhat ""challenging"" gameplay.  Even after 100+ hours of playing the game (while obviously not speed-running) i am still not done with my first farm (storywise) - so there is definitely a lot of game for your buck.

so if a (kind of) relaxing but still moderately challenging farming sim is right up your valley (sorry) this is definitely a game for you."
2503,10/10 vibes

2510,are you looking for a game to Unwind and De-stress especially from a hards day at work? well look no further friend! Stardew Valley is the game for you!
2511,one of the greatest games ever made! My girlfriend and I love playing together and making a super cute farm together thank you.
2512,"real fun
"
2513,I have played both on the PC and PS4. I think all total I have over 1500 hours of time in the game making it very inexpensive entertainment for sure. Stardew is engaging and relaxing and you can play at your own pace. The replayability is very high as well. I have done multiple play throughs using different farm types and choosing to focus on different relationships and different primary sources of income. There is plenty to choose from and you can create tons of variation in your game play.
2514,
2515,It's great.
2516,cool game

2522,One of my favorite games of all time!
2523,"A lovely game by a lovely person. 
If you like Harvest moon, Rune Factory, Animal Crossing, or life is just a little hectic, Stardew is for you. 
Its calming but not boring, has combat but isn't terribly difficult. And you can fight against the games version of Besos, whats not to love?"

2529,"Sure, it starts off as casual fun, you inherit a neat little farm house, you plant a few parsnips, and you think to yourself, this is a cute little game that's all about farming and enjoying the countryside life. But soon enough, the madness starts spreading, you see the money counter go up and you think about how many seeds you need to buy for your next crop cycle. You start looking at all the options, which plant gives the best yield, what takes the least effort to maintain, what makes the most profit, but after few more days you realize you made the wrong choice regardless of what you picked because you can't afford the strawberry seeds during the egg festival. To add insult to injury the iridium hoe called Abigail ends up stealing the first place and the egg hunt prize from you.
You feel devastated. In your anger you do the unthinkable - you type in the search bar ""stardew valley wiki"", and as you feel an out-of-body experience, days, months, and years pass. It all happened so quick, and yet every second of the journey was carefully planned and considered. You enjoy a brief moment of the morning air as you exit your level 4 fully upgraded and customized farmhouse. Your iridium quality starfruit wine casks are almost done aging, and you will have earned another 1,190,700 gold, but you feel nothing. Your perfectly optimized crops and animals being fully automatized keep up the daily routine as you walk past them in disgust. You walk through Pelican town, the town square where you have passed so many times before. You see Abigail greet you and ask you if you want to spend some time with her and play some video games together, but your response is reduced to handing her one of your 7285 amethyst gems and telling her to piss off, because you have a wine empire to oversee. You enter the town shop as you look at the spring seed prices. The numbers are trivial, the cost is irrelevant, you are a multi billionaire wine lord and nothing matters anymore. You take a look at the parsnip seeds, those same ones that you planted the very first day you stepped on this accursed land. You look back on how many hours you spent building the infrastructure to earn millions on a weekly basis, as you click to buy 10 parsnip seeds and proceed to plant them and manually water them, the same way you did on that faithful first day of spring.
Everything is void, empty and without meaning. There is only you, and your little parsnip crop.

11/10
Would stare into the void again if I could."
2530,game good 🧞‍♂️
2531,plant
2532,it awesome
2533,I have never ever liked games like this.  I HATE crafting... but this game makes it super easy and it's not complicated.  I'm addicted to progressing the story lines also.  Prob gonna ruin my life playing this 24/7
2534,"At first, I didn't think I'd like this game. I'd seen streamers play it off-and-on and never understood the appeal for it, and people had always told me, ""It's a farming game. You're in it for the long run if you play. You'd probably be bored."" So, of course, I never picked it up until this summer (at least three years since I'd first seen it played.)
It is much more than just a farming game - thank God. There are many other things to do, such as mining, fishing, foraging, combat - all of this combined with the character quests, events, and more makes for a wonderful experience. I play this game with my friends all of the time, all of us separating to do our own things as the days progress (though I wish this game could handle an 8 person multiplayer instead of 4.) The only times I find myself bored are when I've run out of things to do for the season, and even then I'm itching to keep playing and continue on to the next adventure.
The modded community looks insane, too. There are so many things to be added to this game that the modded communities have been helping on - more characters, more land, mechanics to make the game easier or simply more interesting.
This game is great. I absolutely adore it!
""Are there any cons?"" - Similar to my complaint about Hollow Knight (though much more lenient), travelling seems like a bore and effectively is a time-waster. Sure, there are mechanics to help with that further into the game, but it's annoying early on. Another complaint is, like I mentioned earlier, the four person cap. I'd love to convince more friends to buy and play this game with me, but I'd much rather have it done more efficiently! To add on top of that, I think it'd be cool to allow more people to join as you go (instead of having set a 3 person world, only for you to have to turn down a 4th friend because you already started.)"
2535,have 200 hours on switch bought this cause I  love it so much
2536,Best Game ever !!!!!!!!!

2545,so good!
2546,very fun and relaxing game
2547,is fun
2548,"So I tried this game a few months ago, now, when they did that week-long free trial for it on the Nintendo Switch. I loved it so much I bought the game for the switch. I have at least 100 hours on my first save file, because through times of stress, I've found this game to be a relaxing way for me to process my thoughts. After considering it for a while, I finally bought it on Steam, as well, so that I can play it on my main gaming platform (haha). People tell me my gaming opinions are kind of limited, seeing as my top three games before trying Stardew were (get this) Minecraft, Animal Crossing, and... Doom (2016). 

Well, to me, this game mixes the best of the first two on my list; you have the ability to mine, craft, and fight monsters in the mines (and other dark spaces, depending on your settings), but you also have villagers you can interact with and give gifts to. To try and add a connection to Doom, there are also artifacts, secrets, mysteries, and things that we don't see in our day-to-day life. I love it. 

Ultimately, if you want a game that can be as relaxing or stressful as you make it, and you like Minecraft or Animal Crossing, you'll probably love Stardew. Also, there's wikis online that can help you with gifts and villager schedules. The time cycle is closer to Minecraft than to Animal Crossing, so while you can't mine or do some other interesting functions until at least Spring 5 Year 1, it doesn't take long to get there. 

If you bought it, I hope you love it as much as I do!
"
2549,this game is by far one of the best experiences i've ever had in any game ever would highly suggest to others that enjoy simulation games.
2550,I mean. it's Stardew. if you haven't already played it you should. because its fucking Stardew
2551,"Very replayable, enjoyable every time"
2552,Goth gamer gf
2553,"This game is great to play alone or with your friends. There are so many different ways you can set up your farm, and many different paths to choose for the story line. Even if you're not one for farming, you can enjoy the mining or fishing aspects of this game as well!"
2554,10/10 would farm again
2555,i wanna hav hardcore gay sex with an alcoholic rn
2556,"I have always enjoyed playing Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon, so when it came for me to try Stardew Valley for the first time I was more then happy to do so. My husband has been playing it on Xbox one and his phone for sometime now and suggested it to me on my PC since I enjoy computer games more then anything. 

This game has a lot of features that the other two have and some extra things that make it its own world all together. I enjoy having the option to Marry, have kids and purchase a wide variety of farm animals that produce products that you can turn into various things. I also like how there are enemies that you have to conquer in the mines that keep chipping away at stones all day to find that perfect emerald more entertaining. Every season offers multiple different crops to grow that are only found in that season and during winter when nothing grows you can mine and forage for hours. 

The Community Center brings new missions for you to complete so that you have rewards of items you normally would have to save up for or things special that only can be earned with completing bundles. The Greenhouse is an awesome addition because during winter you can grow any type of crop no matter the season, including crops that continue to produce even after harvest ( You earn so much more money ) and even fruit trees. 

Things i would like to see added in this game or the next one currently being created is:

Other household pets like hamsters, lizards, birds or even to be able to have more then one. Perhaps an adoption center for lost pets that you can give a forever home to. 

You can have people move into the cabins you have on your property, like Linus who is homeless. (This might be a thing already but I haven't figured it out yet).

More areas to travel to Via Bus, like ethnic backgrounds like an oriental place, jungle, tundra for snowy stuff... just some more places to explore and collect cool things to add to your house. 

I am going to write the creator with a bunch of ideas because i really love how this game plays and the retro pixel look. I think this or the next one can be even better and i am more then willing to spend countless hours indulging in this play."
2557,farming
2558,"One of the longest yet funnest games I've ever played 19/10

2559,Playing this game isnt enough i need it in my fucking body (Everyone needs to play this game it is so good fr)
2560,It has a lot of content and is very good in general.
2561,"Simply amazing, calm and relaxing. GREAT soundtrack for each season, right on point: ""Nature's Crescendo"" and ""The Wind Can Be Still"" are so beautiful, so subtle!

Gameplay that I was expecting yet I found it better than I anticipated after around the 20 hour mark. Blasted hours upon hours this last week, simply addicting: (""oh now I need to get this and deliver that, maybe build this and buy some animals for get that item to craft.. oh wait a new NPC quest, mines and so on..""). 

I will post a final, video tour around my whole farm soon whenever I complete the game, cuz why not, I promise it will be great, will do my best (lol)! 

My only blame is why I haven't decided to play this sooner :p"
2562,"Similar to Animal Crossing, but a little more survival mode. Slow pace game that is meant for relaxation. Once you get past the first year on the farm the game becomes addictive."
2563,fun

2599,"far left or far right? nah, i'm farMING"
2600,"Life changing. I never knew I could love the way I love this game. Before, I would wake up every morning unmotivated and self-loathing. Now? I wake up motivated to water my plants, feed my animals, kiss my spouse, and even expose the mayor's dirty little secret. For the first time in years, my parents are shocked to see my pathetic self outside my room. Do yourself a favor by playing Stardew Valley and harass figures of authority with no repercussions."
2601,clunky combat
2602,best game ever i love this games so much omg play this game
2603,"I thought that this game was going to be mostly focused on building a farm and doing all the chores, I wasn't really expecting much, but it turned out that it's way more than that. There's way more adventure in it than I expected, it kind of reminds me of Terraria as the game keeps evolving and surprising you. Lots of (good) RNG, an unexpected medieval fantasy twist, dungeons, daily quests... I've been playing for the last three days and I just can't stop. An amazing and unique game."
2604,"Standing ovation to ConcernedApe, the one many symphony behind this work of art. I have been recommended this game by quite a few friends and at first I didn't really like it. It felt slow and a little confusing. However, just sticking to it a while longer, it has now become my favorite game. Some of my favorite aspects of the game are the music, the art, and the storyline. I could listen to the music all day and still not get bored of it! Additionally, though it's not a super high-resolution game (easy to run on my laptop, ha!), the art is still amazing: the NPCs, landscape, and animations are all on-point. Finally, the storyline is wonderful. You can take the game at any pace you'd like and enjoy it. There is so much freedom and customization in your own adventure that will all lead to the game's trigger events anyways."

2633,it good
2634,Simply great.
2635,"669 hours to date. It just felt like the right time to write a review ya'know? (watch out for spoilers)

669 hours later, and I've completed the community centre for the first time as of last night, reached year 3, my longest game yet, and I see so much more to experience ahead of me.

My favourite part of any game is always the very start. I love having nothing, a clean slate. I like the endless opportunities, and the ultimate feeling of freedoms. What to do? Where to go? And Stardew warms the heart, nudges you softly in no particular direction, and you're on your way. It sweeps you off your feet and hours slip by in the stream of time. Harvesting, exploring, seeing what there is to be offered to the community, and what the community can give to you. Build up your homely farm into a brilliant money-hungry, mass-producing, corporate beast, or don't, you can just run around wooing folks. In game you have these wonderful, multifaceted characters to get to know, and to watch grow. They actually change (shout out to my wifey Haley), revealing backstories, and dreams, thoughts to ponder. That doesn't even consider the amazing modder community that have toiled away for years alongside Eric to crack this game open, and feed it's Soul.
IRL, you work together to build on this world, communicate, delegate, and form partnership, sharing tidbits, and goals. Learning from eachother and splitting up the world's singles amongst yourselves. Making the time go faster, and it's fun! It's something to look forward to on a Wednesday night, when everyone has work the next day.
I'm only 60% of the way through the achievements, and already have felt so much satisfaction. I've rallied so many of my friends into playing, and I own this game on 3 different platforms. It's worth it. 

Take your time. Enjoy the game.

I feel like there's more I want to say, and there is, but I am cutting into my gaming time tonight xD So back to the Dew! I need to get a rabbit's foot, something, something, heard it's lucky."
2636,"115.2 hours on record and still no review!?
At first the game is only slightly open to you, but after a long, long time you actually get to see some awesome stuff.
+ Go at your own pace.
+ Good amount of satisfaction and a  need to do more.
+ Fair leveling system.
+ Hilarious and interesting characters all with their own quirky thing.
+ Super customizable farms! You read that right, seven different awesome farms!!
+ An amazing world that requires hard work and time, that makes you feel ready when you get there.
+ Friendly community, I found my friends pretty quickly.
+ - Can take a lot of time away from you.
- Feels like a slog some days, other days you're overwhelmed with chores.
- Weapons don't have very much variation.
- Prices go up. Stupid inflation!

Here are some tips.
1. Relax, Remeber you can go at your own pace. Crops don't rot, and relationships can wait a little bit.
2. Listen to the music.
3. Get home before 2:00 or else you'll lose something important. 
4. Keep your relationships fresh, they will decay and eventually wilt.
5. Don't waste a couple days on end in bed cause you're waiting to unlock something. 

That was my review for Stardew Valley! Have a happy day and don't forget about this game put it on your wishlist for later."

2647,very calming and simple <3
2648,Relaxing
2649,"I may be a little bias because this is one of my favourite games, but I truly recommend Stardew Valley if you are looking for a cozy and relaxing game. In this game you basically inherit a farm from your grand father where you will need to grow fruits & vegetables as a main source of income. Other activities include mining, foraging, fighting monsters, fishing, cooking, taking care of farm animals and getting to know the town's people. By getting to know the town's people/giving them gifts you can get access to short clips of their character, gain access to more cooking recipes and if possible date/marry your favourite characters. My only complain is that I wish  I don't really have much of a complaint with this game."
2650,"can't make a harem, not worth the money"

There are so many different play styles and speeds that it can encompass. It's an all around great game. It takes me back to my childhood and playing Harvest Moon 64."
2691,"Farm, Fish, Mine.
Game good."
2692,this game ruined my life and i said thank you

2704,"I've spent a couple hours on this game. It's amazing, if you want a game to play by yourself and spend hours fishing... yeah I'm one of those people. or playing with friends (my personal favorite thing to do) it will be fun however you decide to play it. I hope anyone who gives this game a chance is able to make as many amazing memories with this game as I have. 

Signed: A fishing addict.
P.S. you have a problem, not me, how can you not like fishing!"

"
2710,i love this
2711,"Really chill, and interacting with the villagers is fun. It's even better because the creator openly supports modding to play the game how you want and actually updates the game to help modders. A+ game, creator, and community."
2712,"A very cute game, this one reminds me a lot of Harvest Moon for sure and the best part is that you can have your friends to join in too so you can get even more tasks done together! My only gripe is the fishing though i'm sure that's just a me thing. Overall it's a very wholesome game~"
2713,Yes
2714,"this is one of my all time favorite games to play when i am looking for a semi slow game to play, there are many different ways and styles in which you can play this game. which i think is pretty cool. i would recomend this game to anyone who likes minecraft or terraria"

2737,"Relaxing cozy game, easily immersed in all the quests and exploration!"
2738,This game is my depression cure. It has so much care put into it by the creator and I'd recommend it to absolutely anyone who likes wholesome content.
2739,"Stardew Valley is excellent, entertaining, I could say amazing with too many things to be able to create and do as you always wanted on your farm next to a town that grows by your side and, of course, with you; It seems to me one of the best role-playing games, and in this style, stardew has one of the best recommendations to hang out, have fun, create and enjoy all this with friends since the multiplayer is very enjoyable and you have a great time there."
2740,...
2741,"I started playing with my girlfriend about 2 months ago, we have made two different worlds (one with mods, one without). The game is a one of a kind experience in both ways of playing. We have been fully addicted to this game and it has been a blissful addiction the entire time :) HIGHLY RECOMMEND"

2763,Super fun game to play and chill :)
2764,"So you see, this has romance, and I love romance, so I like this."
2765,"My father passed away on May 16th, 2021, due to the negligence of another driver, and two days later, my cat of 20 years was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Needless to say my mental state in the following weeks, months, and likely years to come - was and remains, at times, questionable. 

Without giving away too many spoilers, the character is given their farm when life becomes too much. 

This game was a lifesaver when that character was me."
2766,farming simulator but better
2767,"the perfect game. the developer (ONE GUY DOING EVERYTHING? be careful, he's a hero!) is always so quick to bugfix and has shown how much he really cares for this game and its community. stardew is the perfect game to play to relax after a long day, but there is also parts of the game that are incredibly stressful if you're looking for a game with a thrill lol this game is great by itself, but is a blast in multiplayer. the only con i can give is that replayability is slightly lacking, but somehow i still have fun replaying over and over. thanks for this one, concernedape <3"
2768,chicken
2769,"Very cool, trust"
2770,Very fun game
2771,stardew valley>>>my life
2772,"It's Stardew Valley. If you haven't heard of it or never watched gameplay, it's something you can find plenty of with one google search. I would always recommend searching a game up and seeing its content and play style before purchasing, just so you know what you're getting into... But yeah, there are so many people who love this game and will sell their insides for more of it. Let's be real though, you should get this on PC instead of console. Mods can make it more fun. :)"
2773,its fun
2774,I enslaved the entire Chicken Race
2775,This game is amazing and super addicting!
2776,"Very calm game. Lots of options. Easy to mod, too, which is awesome."
2777,"PET DINOSAURS > EVERYTHING

yes :)"
2778,"I definitely dont recommend playing this game cause its a genuinely enjoyable experience for quite cheap and you get hooked. Getting hooked in something is never a good thing, because its really hard to drop it once you pick it up. So avoid at all cost. unimaginable/ 10"
2779,"Really fun!!! The NPC's have incredibly detailed lives and stories that you can witness or ignore! It is also pretty laid back but not super relaxing because the time does move quite fast and sometimes the pressure is on!!! Over all though, a very fun game with laid out missions and fun stories!!!"
2780,"经常有朋友关心我，问我一个人在异国他乡会不会寂寞，会不会想家。
我只有一个回答。
我从来没有离开过家。




家里还有老婆孩子热炕头，我老婆好辣，我好爱他。"

2782,"I love this game, its great.
You can mod it too."
2783,So relaxing and fun!
2784,Great game.
2785,Its good but keeps crashing
2786,"Wow. Spectacular game, especially considering the staff behind this.

I've played primarily co-op for the whole game. The game offers so much to do, but when you have a shared farm, dividing up the labor increases the efficiency and makes for a really interesting and replayable experience. I cannot speak to the single player experience, however.

The late game (50+ hours) falls off the track in terms of having a focus, but by then you are so invested that you want to see it through. The game scales ridiculously, so it can cater to the super efficient as well as the more casual player."
2787,"great game except it crashes SO much :( it crashes at least 5 times a day, and ive literally been stuck on playing the same day over and over anmd i dont know what to do to make it stop"
2788,Good
2789,"yipeee
"
2790,"it's a super addicting game and has loads of fun activities to do, if you enjoy games like sims n stuff this is def a game you should check out"
2791,its amazing
2792,
2793,Good Game
2794,"I have played a bit and i can confidently say its a very good game, great for playing with or without friends, i play it while listening to my profs lectures to study the story and characters are all great and there is so much more to do than meets the eye, i will warn any players that while you could definitely figure everything out in game the wiki is a very useful tool i highly recommend using it to your advantage."

2797,yes
2798,this game singlehandedly cured my depression.
2799,10/10 IGN would play again i lost my dad playing this game and i dont regret a thing
2800,"Love everything about this game. Not a fan of very little tutorial, but it just made me more interested in all the secrets to be found."
2801,"Got two gf and bf simultaneously, gorgeous."
2802,the game is fun it is complicated but then finding out how to do it or doing it is so accomplishing and of how easy it is to mod the game
2803,game is gud

2805,THIS IS SO GOOD REALLY GREAT I LOVE IT BEST GAME EVER

2808,"Can have cat, very goomd"
2809,"This game is reason why I started to play games again and why I have even account on Steam. 
It's so peaceful, relaxing, funny, creative, mysterious and adventurous. There is so much possibilities, you can be anyone you want...I'm happy just by hearing opening melody and I like to come back to this game all the time."
2810,"Great game, very chill and addicting."
2811,"Realy good game / Relaxing

I loved playing this game, but the best part is if you instal mods it gives the game a biger breath and a loot new cool content 10/10

2813,"One of best and least expensive, relaxing games you can get.
Addictive, peaceful music, fun and much more than a farming simulator.
"
2814,"Have played since the game came out and still playing today, so definitely worth the money!"
2815,Awesome game
2816,"Very nice and calm game.
Totally recommended for relax"
2817,This is my favorite game and after 600 hours of playing I only have one bad thing to say. I got an achievement in the game and it didnt give me the same achievement withing steam so I am very unimpressed and not sure what to do. I dont want to restart the achievement when in game I do have it. Please fix steam
2818,Im Gay

2852,i foamed at the mouth for a doctor who totally has a mommy kink
2853,Farming rules
2854,"No question one of my favorite games. I own this on steam and switch, and it's great as a solo game and as a co-op game. You have the ability to only care for certain parts and still have an enjoyable experience. I love fishing."
2855,"I miss you L.C.
This was your favorite game...
Wishing you well."

2862,"A very quaint, ""slice of life"" farming sim. It's incredibly charming.

A must buy for the single player, and is one of the best games to play with your spouse/ S.O. in multiplayer

solid 9/10, and SMAPI + Mods will flesh out that last point for the shortcomings."

2871,mmm pam.
2872,imma blow pennys back out
2873,"This game is so relaxing, rewarding, etc. There's more to it than just farming. A multitude of quests, endless mining, fishing, cooking, you name it. Countless secrets to discover, ALOT of NPC interactions and so much more. I highly recommend to anyone, any gamer, any age. This game is wonderful vanilla, but AMAZING with mods as well!"
2874,A god tier laid-back game you should play this
2875,it is shit
2876,love this game
2877,"This game is great. The key to enjoying it is to not rush it. If it takes you a couple years in game to get a grip on things, that's no big deal. Just relax and enjoy."
2878,Its a cozy farm sim that help me relax
2879,yes
2880,I love love LOVE this game. This is my go to game to relax and just chill while enjoying the graphics and AMAZING music <3
2881,Good game
2882,Very chill
2883,"fun and cute game. 

drink coffee to run faster.
eat spicy eel to run faster.
ride a hose to travel faster.
all 3 of these stack. 

i bought cat ears and put them on my horse."
2884,very fun :) if you want some peace play this and its a nice and slow game to ease into it
2885,Yes YES Yes
2886,"There are not many games I can confidently say have been one of my favorite games to relax and play, but this is without a doubt one of the first to come to mind. I'm usually one of the sweaty try-hards on FPS or MOBA's but every now and then it's nice to relax on a game that you can turn your brain off to. 10/10 Couldn't recommend enough honestly"
2887,Lives up to the hype.
2888,"I have played is game a lot longer then I have had it on steam, I downloaded it originally in a morally ambiguous way if you know what I mean but there is a reason that I bought it on steam. This was the game is just amazing that I needed to buy it on steam in a legit way cause I owe it to Mr Ape on making this absolute classic of a game. I don't play it much anymore just but I hope to get back into is soon cause I will know if I ever need to rest from everything this game will be waiting.
Just buy the dam game even if you only play it for 10 hours I think its worth it"
2889,"Recommended for single player and occasional co-op visit with a friend, but super not recommended for trying full co-op from the beginning. My husband and I thought we could have a peaceful little farm together, but the speed is SO fast in multiplayer that it takes away all of the fun. Together we were trying to figure out the game mechanics, read the NCP's words, and figure out what the items did, in doing so, plus communicating with each other our different achievements etc, it felt like all we could do in the game is wake up and then rush to bed, over and over. It was ridiculous. So I started playing alone and my husband and I moved on to other co-op games. It is basically unplayable in ""super speed mode"" co-op, and I hope the creators fix this. As a single player the game is really fun, but since we bought it specifically play together, I will have to not recommend, because it did not work for the purpose we purchased it."
2890,Stardew Valley is an incredibly fun and relaxing game that everyone should try!
2891,Good game imo
2892,Honestly the best game I've ever played.
2893,I dont play for long periods at a time but the game sets a hook and i just keep coming back to it.
2894,I want to marry a chicken
2895,i have never wanted to interact with an npc consistently until i started this game now i can't stop bothering them they all love me i give them eggs
2896,AMAZING
2897,good soup
2898,"GOD!! this game is good, 
alot of things to keep you busy and keep coming back each day.

 Between mining, fishing, farming, and building friendships with villagers its just such a good game!! a 100/10!"
2899,slays
2900,Simply addicting. There's a lot of things to do!
2901,11/10
2902,"Everything about this game is lovely, meeting the people, creating a functional farm, trying to mine without dying (because i'm awful at combat) meeting goals and always having something to do or somewhere to be. It is flat out an amazing game. I have it on console, pc and my phone I just cant seem to get enough of it."
2903,69
2904,"As someone who's favorite games tend to be pretty action-driven (like Devil May Cry 3, Binding of Isaac, Metal Gear Rising, Gunfire Reborn - as shown by my avatar), I thought that I'd get bored with this game, hence I became reluctant of buying it for a while. But some weeks ago, I decided to buy this game while it was still on sale, play it for a little bit and, after surviving Year 1 Spring, I fell in love with this game. It's so simple, yet so refreshing from everything I have played in recent memory.
I mean, you can plant some potatoes and proceed to harvest three times of what you've sown, befriend the townsfolk with eggs, marry the goth g/bf of your dreams, tolerate the existence of a complete loser because he's the one who upgrades your tools, get your ducklings to swim, break the economy with pigs, [spoiler]and see the owner of a small business send a manager of a supermarket flying[/spoiler], all in the same year.
10/10, would do it again."
2905,I LIKE TO FARM
2906,This game is just classic. I've been playing for years on my switch. Just started modding for the first time and playing the expanded version. Its like a whole new game :D Never gets old.

2926,Addictive!
2927,"i play a lot of games but this one stands out compared to the ones i usually play, i dont know why but this game is nice and relaxing to play"
2928,"Loveee this game if you're into farming games like Harvest Moon or even Animal Crossing. 
I can't believe i haven't reviewed this game yet.
There are a bunch of events, there are npcs that you can romance and hell you can go dungeon crawling in a cave. 
But Personally, I prefer to mod this game. There are TONS of mods, even those that add additional NPCs to romance and new areas to explore. 
I had more fun with those, compared to the Vanilla
oh and obviously.. can  play multiplayer 

Cons/Disappointments/Nitpicks:
hmm.. None really. Not that I can think of. 

>Is this worth full price? 
Yeah I'd say this is worth it."

2931,"Fun and relaxing game. I really enjoy playing it.
One thing to say: take it slow, and don't expect to finish everything the first year."
2932,Most calming game ever. Simple as that.
2933,nice
2934,
2935,Love stardew valley.
2936,In a wonderfully rare move. Stardew Valley takes well known formula but manages to do it better and with more heart than all its competitors before it. After playing this if you try to go back and try the current original brands. They will all feel soulless. This game gives you all the busywork from harvest moon and others but hit you with amazingly heartfelt moments. Its difficult to explain but you'll love every part and always feel like you're progressing. Games like this are rare and I'm sure you will be hooked. Go Chucklefish!

2943,"A great game to play either with friends or alone, it just gives u time to relax and chill. The soundtrack is cute, although it bores a bit from time to time its still nice to open and play for a hour once a weak. Would recommend 100%, I personally don't grind however it is enjoyable both ways. The character designs are cute and special in their own ways (personality and appearance vise). Hope you have as mush as fun as I had :))"
2944,"good game, lots of replayability"
2945,"Great story, good game controls, vintage point-and-click adventure feeling.
Good for kids as well."
2946,fun game
2947,Lovely
2948,"Absolutely LOVE this game, many many different things to do and not grindy like most games. Love the story lines and different reactions Npc dialogues give, would love to see it expanded more and more natural characters introduced as years go along in the game."
2949,"Delightfully escapist. Wish the real world were like this. Inspired me to start a garden, and now that's my favorite hobby."
2950,It is fun and enjoyable
2951,It's okay I guess

2953,epic game
2954,Good game

2956,please help i cant stop
2957,"I cannot express the depth of my love for this game. It's as easy or as challenging as you want it to be. The stories, should you choose to unlock them, can have a lot of depth (try Shane if you want to cry). The mechanics are great. Time management can provide a huge challenge, and a rewarding one. The available mods can add a lot, but you don't need them to enjoy a full run-through. If you love resource and time management, this game is for you. If you just want a chill, cute farming game, it's also for you. Flexible and fun with endless playability."
2958,Super relaxing game
2959,"GG One the best farming, RPGs i've played."
2960,fun
2961,love farming
2962,my go to comfort game tbh
2963,Good game
2964,bl eu chciken
2965,One of the greatest games of all time.  The developer pushes free updates.  Build a farm and invite your friends.
2966,fun times were had by all
2967,"I'll be the first to tell you, I hate playing games slowly. Since I started playing with a consistent group of people, I've blasted through game after game, level after level, etc., all without a moment's pause. Quite frankly, it's a terrible habit, but I'm not like that with Stardew. Sure, I could blast through a lot of the objectives in the first year, farming, foraging, crafting, fighting, and everything else, but I don't [i]want[/i] to. I like exploring the mechanics of the game, pushing myself where I can, limiting what I must, and then doing it all again the next day. I could go on and on about psychology trying to explain it, but I'll just cut to the chase and say that this game genuinely helps me slow down and enjoy the simple things in life. Playing a game where I'm not constantly surrounded by cowards and dead men (that's Darth Vader, for ya) is such a refreshing experience, and I absolutely love it."
2968,Cozy
2969,"whilst casually snooping through my neighbor Marnie's belongings one day i discovered the mayors filthy underwear. *gasp*, ""an affair..."" i think to myself. 
naturally, i take the underwear, with no intention of returning it. Marnie is never here anyway, what is she going to do about it? 
soon after, i'm informed of an annual community Luau... how nice. with a potluck soup? incredible news. a soup in which we all contribute our own ingredients... the underwear goes in before i know it. everyone's eating underwear soup. we learn mayor lewis has a ""tangy"" flavor. 
maybe you should have been more careful, lewis... maybe you should have shown your woman some respect, lewis... that way she could be less distracted and do her DAMN JOB, LEWIS. I NEED TO BUY HAY AND ANIMALS SOMEWHERE, LEWIS. 

i'm coming for haley next. she just... needs to be humbled. it'd be good for her. 
 

10/10 would recommend. more than worth the price! the modding community has made some amazing mods as well, especially Stardew Valley Expanded!"
2970,"I LOVE this, I have no dislikes at all!!!! That's just how much I love it!"
2971,It's relaxing and fun....one of those no-stress games. It has a lot of things to do and some fun events. I thoroughly enjoy the game.
2972,"I've purchased this game both on my switch and pc. I love both the single player and group play types. Stardew Valley has kept me engaged for several months now. I haven't hit any end game type material, but I'm enjoying the progress I have made."
2973,this game is odd i play it and 201 hours later my dad is still gone :(
2974,peak fiction

2976,"I have played this game for over 1,000 hours on switch and some on ps4 so if that tells you anything i have bought this game on 3 different platforms and am obsessed with the game. It is amazing and there is so much content to go through it is insane i would recommend 1,000/10"
2977,just play it
2978,great game but my computer refuses to launch it because of steam taking its time to load
2979,"its so chill and wholesome farming rpg, but also cool details to game and actual mining/combat system"
2980,it nice
2981,I love this game! It's fun with friends that you trust. If you like the classic rpg game and pixel games that has a farm? This game is for you! I recommend this game for everyone!
2982,"I have 546 hours on record for this game. I was an FPS gamer when I found it, so I didn't like it at first. But then I realized it was a neat little casual games with tons of secrets and hidden knowledge. There's too much to say about Stardew Valley so I'll keep it brief.

PROS
- Lots of things to do (mining, fishing, foraging, combat, farming). Doing things makes you better at them. More incentive to do things!
- Casual af, or capitalist af. If you want to just grow crops because you like them, then do so! If you want to grow a crop because it makes the most money, do so! If you want to fully automate your farm and expand the empire, do so! Do whatever you want kid. 
- Dating simulator. You got a goth fetish? You like alcoholics you find passed out in the fields? You like hippies drinking strange juice? You like hot women with interchangeable names? Go git em tiger.
- Collectathon all day. This game is a collector's wet dream. If you like collecting things and using those things to craft items, then just buy this game and play it.
- Home/Farm customization. Lay out your crops how you want, organize your furniture how you want.
- Steady game progression. The strength of items and upgrades make the game a lot easier around the end of season 1 if you've been working hard.
- Fun with friends

CONS
- The inventory UI kinda sucks. It doesn't look appealing. Some items aren't clear about what button activates them. It just does a basic job of showing you items.
- Sometimes NPCs aren't at their shops even though the shop is open
- Random soft-locks
- Some quests feel borderline impossible to complete
- Gets pretty boring after you have decent money flow and automation
- Sucks without friends
- Elliot

I'd say the game is worth $15 USD for all the content and nostalgia it contains. If you take the time to enjoy the artwork and aesthetic of the game, watch cutscenes, it's well worth the money. If you abuse it like a greedy corporate vulture, it can get old pretty fast. Meta gamers will appreciate all the different choices and paths they can take to make money."
2983,Awesome game ever! Playing this together with the love of my life <3
2984,very great game
2985,"This game is so lovely, if you're thinking about buying it, do it! I strongly recommend finding some good mods to go with it :-)"
2986,"Great flippin game. Real home run, this one is."
2987,"Amazing! play it and find out, wont spoil anything. Super addictive."
2988,"So much more than just a farming sim. The game itself is surprisingly in-depth and has a lot of content. Especially later on, as endgame is my favorite part and is a blast to play through.

If you're looking for a casual, fun experience that lasts a few hundred hours, then pick it up. Completely worth the money in my opinion."
2989,"Stardew Valley is one of my favorite games and I've been playing it solo and with my hubby on and off for years. The SVE mod (and others) have added new quality content, allowing the experience to continue and also enhancing it. This the best farming game there is and basically makes Harvest Moon and the Seasons games obsolete...I always enjoyed them before SV existed, but now there's no point in ever going back."
2990,good game
2991,grind
2992," This game is super addictive and great.

2993,I am married to an alcoholic 10/10
2994,"a very cool game that totally will not consume your life and all your time <3. seriously this is JAM PACKED with content, 15 USD for a game that you could play for 500+ hours and still not be sick of is insane. not to mention the modding community that adds not only hundreds of hours of content to the game but also makes it more accessible to people with less gaming ability. and thats just singleplayer! between co-op, modding, challange runs/speedruns, and normal play there is just, an insane ammount of content and it could not be more worth the price"
2995,10/10
2996,Muito very good de bom!
2997,"Great game don't join Joja mart
"
2998,Believe the hype. This game is charming and addictive. Do yourself a favor and try some mods. They really open up an already fantastic game.
2999,"I'm sad, I cant even get girls in the game :( I'm just going to stay forever lonely :( gave that B*tch a flower and everything."
3000,yeeee
3001,uyumak için ideal
3002,FUN
3003,Its ok
3004,A good game that becomes great when you learn about the thriving modding community around it.
3005,very fun and cute game :)
3006,"""The only thing that is worse than getting shot is getting shot again"", this games shoots me with happy bullets :)"
3007,If I could erase my memory for one game an re-experience it all over again it would be this one. I've played 500+ hours of this on my switch and computer. I am a long time harvest moon and rune factory fan but this game blows all of those games out of the water. I bought it on the computer to mod it and I highly recommend it if you've played through the original already. It adds so much more to the game! Especially Stardew Valley Expanded mod.
3008,"Play Time: >150 hrs (So far)
Stardew Valley=happiness, 10/10 game totally worth 15 bucks (It should been more but hey I'm not mad)
Should definitely play if you like a laid back farming game with mining, fishing and making friends with the towns people. Though there is so many more things with the game I cant put down (bc there's a lot). There are also many achievements in the game and tons of stuff to do so you wont get bored easily (Including speed running many categories of the game if your into that)
Also, if the vanilla version isn't enough fun for you, you can also try the many mods that are out there! :D"
3009,Good.
3010,"Stardew is such a cozy, chill, fun, and cutesy game! I'm addicted!!"
3011,"This game is one of the best games i've ever played and I would recommend it to everyone and try it! I was addicited, I bought it on everything I could, and you should too"

3018,"This game is very adorable, but when your new, you dotn know where to get stuff, or where to go to buy things. Its very hard navigating when your new, but you get used to it after searching up how/where to do/get something."
3019,"I don't have a lot of hours in the game, but it is a good one. Just relaxing, until you realize it's 1am and you're half across the map and-OH GOD I NEED TO MOVE! OH SHIT OH SHIT! 
If you like Harvest Moon (I only played the one on the DS but it has the same feel) or you like the nice pace of Animal Crossing (But it goes off in game time not IRL)
GG, no ree, 9.1/10"
3020,Really fun and a very open and inclusive game! I find there's lots you can do and lots you can discover. I totally recommend this game to anyone and everyone.
3021,"I was told I would love this game years ago! I never gave it a shot because ""it didn't look like a game I would be into"". I was so wrong! I love this game and have now purchased it for everyone in my household on every platform we have to try to get them to play it with me. I just reached Perfection on the Switch, and now am switching to PC to play with my spouse. BUY IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
3022,way better than therapy
3023,Its very chill.
3024,"Don't have any complains aside from hoping there will be more updates regarding NPC and stories but so far I'm just enjoying this relaxing easy-playing game mode, best part of it is that it's not draining your money to get ahead."

3029,real
3030,"I was obsessed with this game when i first got it and play it a lot, but now i rareluy visit it since is a bit repetitive and kinda hard to advance 
The graphics are very good and cute and it is a very chill game that i enjoy very much, definetely recommend"
3031,10/10
3032,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
3033,Massive re-playability. Highly enjoyable in every sense. Full of little secrets
3034,accidentally played this game for 15 hours
3035,So fun to start a farm with friends!

3037,Great Game!
3038,"Watched a video of the story of the developer. Wow has he had a hard time making this game. Glad it came out as amazing as it did.

"
3039,"Good stuff only a few issues with the game for long term gameplay after ""beating"" the game, which you don't actually do honestly.  Once you've maxed out your funds, its not like there is really anything else to buy other then resources to play doll house with your farm or inside of your house.  Once you've gone through the caves, everything else.  There isn't much incentive to play and then you just reset and start a new game.  I've maxed out my funds, completed all quests, the only thing left honestly is if you want to get achievements or if you want to just rotate between marriages in the town etc.  Its not a bad game, you just can't really do much of anything with the money after you've completed all the things with it.  I wish there were expansions or something, it just feels ""done"" once you become a bizillionaire.  The locals seem like robots and it almost makes more sense just to help the corporation unless you want to grind the community center.  Screw the towns people, not like they treat you any different after you've helped their selfish asses!"
3040,pick up some mods and is 12/10 rating
3041,"Absolutely love this game, so much to do and see. the fun never ends!"
3042,"Absolutely amazing - you have so many things to choose from to do! From relationships to farming, mining to uncovering secrets, and adopting animals to cooking foods. So much variety and a very relaxing and somehow, sometimes intense game. Love it <3"
3043,this game is great but i want to date the wizard plz
3044,"Really recommend, but some who like fast-paced action may not find it as enjoyable, but still could be a nice change of pace. If you've played animal crossing this is similar but not the same and you will almost certainly like it."
3045,"whats not to love?

running stardew on my PC now after playing for a long time on Switch, wanted to be able to run mods and especially wanted to play the extended mod, new love for the game having more areas to explore and what not, couldn't recommend higher for people that like this genre of games."
3046,I hid all my friends furniture in the cave :)
3047,Best game ever made
3048,"fun game, even more fun with mods"
3049,fun
3050,"The game is adorable, music is relaxing and the game itself is amazing. Love this game. Played it 8 hours straight when I first got it."
3051,best game
3052,"I'm not a big simulation player. I think that simulation games just tend to inspire more responsibilities than what you have in real life. Looking back now, those responsibilities are much easier in simulation games since they do not require as many factors. So I thought I'll buy this renowned game and it became the rule to my perception of simulation games, not the exception. I thought I wouldn't enjoy it and easily abandon it the first week I installed and tried the game but alas, I'm still playing it now even if I have more backlogs in real life than in it.

Also, you don't have to log in every day. You can just take it at your own pace regardless of other people's progress you see in the internet."
3053,"very fun! kinda frustrating at times with how long it can take to save money for stuff but if you play at a comfortable pace, it all falls together lovely in the end."
3054,Yea
3055,10/10
3056,Its very fun and I enjoy playing it. It is a good game for serious and non-serious gamers alike
3057,it's ok i guess

3076,"The domestic farm aspect of the game is wonderful, and with the fantasy twist it gives a sense of escapism without ever having to go anywhere. It lets everyday, normal life turn into the fantastical. I started playing the game because of all the community pieces about it, and I fell in love with my little farm life."
3077,Very fun and doesnt force you into straight relationships. There is also an option for aro/ace people to have someone move onto your farm without being in a romantic relationship! 10/10
3078,love this game
3079,"its just a chill and comforting game to play and come back to, helps you relax after playing a long day."

3084,best game that steam has to offer
3085,"It's 2022 and you still need to install SMAPI and update mods constantly to get it working.. now imagine trying to get SMAPI working on your Steam Deck to play this game on the go.

Just add Steam Workshop support already, ffs.  It's the one large blemish on this fantastic game!  They added online coop and they really just need Steam Workshop support to make it easy to auto install mods.

Binding of Isaac Rebirth has it. 

Also I know this game is a bit older now but it being capped to 60 fps despite it being a 2d game is a little annoying.  Most people have higher refresh rate monitors and you can't really take advantage of that.  I am pretty sure there is no 21:9 Ultrawide support either.

It IS a great game but I wish the art style was more like Snes Harvest Moon and not like an indie title.  I know that is a weird criticism but I don't think I have seen that anywhere.

You CAN get the SMAPI mods running on the Steam Deck to work with this game but it is a little more complicated to do, and you cannot use mod launchers like from Nexus Mods I think."
3086,Once you know what you're doing it really sucks you in. Hours and hours of fun! Plenty of replay-ability.
3087,: )
3088,"A little slow at first but once you get into it, you will find yourself playing it a lot more often than you think, gets quite addicting.

Look forward to getting the damn Horse.... whenever that might be, if ever be LOL"
3089,"i absolutely love this game! There is always something to do and it will keep you entertained for literal months. I also am in love with the newest update! It has added and provided so much more to this game. Concerned Ape is a wonderful creator, and I can't wait to play his next game the Haunted Chocolatier!"
3090,Good
3091,v good
3092,"Super fun and cute
"
3093,"I'm autistic and have anxiety, depression and possibly OCD. This game is a LIFESAVER. My brain has never been so quiet and I've never been so happy playing a game. It really helps me to escape reality and the stresses of real life.
Just try not to play too late into the night or for too long hours! (It happens VERY easily)"
3094,"best game ever. i've never been more obsessed. the story lines for characters are amazing, the style is super cute, and the gameplay in general never gets boring. would recommend."

3125,"This game is great! You can play with friends or by yourself, caves are fun to explore and its easy (And Fun) to farm! The missions can be hard but they aren't impossible! Fishing is hard sometimes, but its satisfying when you DO get a catch! Anyways, i recommend this game to anyone who wants a farming, exploring, fighting and slightly building game! The pixel art is AMAZING in this game so its high quality!"
3126,Fun little game for couples.
3127,This got me off league of legends.
3128,"Some people do a crossword, some people cross stitch, I Stardew Valley. Sometimes if I'm away from the farm for a while and I don't remember my plan, well I just start a new farm. Love this game."
3129,Abigail best girl
3130,Very cozy and easy to sink many hours into. Very good replay-ability and that's all without any mods. Your loved ones might not see you for a few days once you get those.

3140,recomend the game very chill and has many secrets
3141,"Love this game. It reminds me of animal crossing mixed with zelda. when I first started playing, i thought that i had wasted my money, but after a month or so, i decided to give it another chance. best decision EVER. after downloading mods, that made this amazing game even more awesome."

3152,"It's a charming game with plenty of humor. It's much better with friends, but still good on it's own. If you prefer playing solo then it'll be perfect for you either way."
3153,"This game makes you bribe people into loving you, it takes more time to get together with someone in this digital world of growing blueberries than it does in the real world."
3154,good game
3155,"Tremendous fun, both solo and cooperatively, with a generous wealth of things to do and see. A place that feels good to do things in."

3163,"I mean if you dont know what stardew is play it, worth more then most 80$ games"
3164,"Love this game, haven't played much on this account, but still love it.
There are many parts to this game i adore and find enjoyable such as ...
The farming aspect is perfect, having to remember when to plant crops in certain seasons and the figure out the more profitable ones.The size of each farm is perfect, not too big and not too little with enough room to expand or compact but not clutter which is the case with other farming games.
The social part of the game is unique to other games of how it is approached, building up a friendship and figuring out who likes what as gifts and eventually proposing and living on the farm with you.
Expanding the farm and gathering the resources to do so is a fun aspect, and it creates goals for the future of your farm.
The combat is an excellent factor of the game since you can progress with a minimal amount or it or just go full out and go seeking a battle within the mines.
Every update adds something new which i praise ConcernedApe for, the effort put into this game is phenomenal which is key to its success and will lead the game into the future.
-Satisfied Stardew Player"
3165,Wholesome and relaxing. Ability to mod is enjoyable.
3166,"Honestly, in this world, I have two favourite games and, it is safe to say, this one takes first place."

3170,game will make u lose track of time fr
3171,"If you hate Shane or Sebastian, 
do not talk to me. 
<3"
3172,"I feel like Stardew Valley belongs on the same upper echelon as Terraria, Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy VII and X, and other classic gems that are in the conversation of the greatest video game ever made. You don't need someone to tell how good this game is, you need to play it and see it for yourself. There is one criticism that I will make, and that is, while this game does an excellent job of pacing itself, what I don't like is how easily you can have your entire first year wasted if you miss one of the easy community center bundles that can only appear one season out of the year. For example, if you forgot that melons were only a summer crop and you only saved 4 gold quality and didn't get a fifth, you have to wait until next summer to be able to complete that bundle, and it can be very easy to just give up on all your progress after 30 hours into the game. 

That being said, if you're less autistic than me and can remember to do stuff like this, or can just keep playing and move on, it is an absolute must have. Please play this game."
3173,its addicting so be careful
3174,yes
3175,A Really fun game to play with friends. Now im gone from a shooter games adict to a farmer adict. Hurray!
3176,Good game
3177,Nice simulation game
3178,"this game really has it all, taking care of a farm. someone who loves me. and spending all my time trying to beat Journey of the Prairie King with no deaths while Abigail sits at my farm wondering where the hell i am all the time.

10/10 would devote my life to Journey of the Prairie King instead of taking care of my farm and Abigail again."
3179,I would die for this game
3180,.
3181,REALLY FUN
3182,Axe go bonk
3183,Fun
3184,gud
3185,"Wow, great game! For the first time in my life I've been playing for 10 hours straight."
3186,Way more to do than I ever could have imagined
3187,"Good game, try mods."
3188,"Hands down this is easily in my Top 3 games i have ever played. After 400 hours of it i still come back for more every now and then, i still actually haven't even completed everything and i have a 300 hour save. This game should be a mandatory buy for absolutely every steam user."
3189,chickens :)
3190,"there's a lot of choices and variety in this game, and the families portray what we have in modern times, whether it's a rebuilt family, or a family member is a soildier, parentless children,etc."
3191,Old MacDonnald had a farm! E-I-E-I-O!!
3192,"This is a really fun game, its really peaceful and provides a delightful aspect of escapism."

3215,very good
3216,"I liked the possibilities of this game, for me I liked being an artisan to make money, but you could also farm crops, ranch animals, and much more."
3217,yes
3218,"This game has it all! Farming, mining, monster slaying, romance, capitalism, combat, and much more. How could you not want to make ridiculous amount of money farming strawberries, blueberries, and cranberries every year for decades? My favorite part of the game is romancing the same character every play through and never exploring any other options. Making sure to ignore my responsibilities and spending the entire day at the bar trying to beat the arcade game is also great! And who could forget beating children at every single minigame every season. Truly a masterpiece!"
3219,"this game is good for those like me, autists who enjoy tasks; and others, touch deprived horny bastards"
3220,the best game ive ever played
3221,"By far, one of, if not, the best game I've ever played."
3222,Real good
3223,I love this game. It is so calming and I have such a fun time. It is like Animal Crossing but with more content. Love <3
3224,I honestly just can't say enough good things about Stardew Valley. It's a game that I can always come back to and still enjoy again. My only true complaint has been the issues with multiplayer following a recent update. Otherwise it's truly one of my favorite games. 10/10 recommend!
3225,lovely game!
3226,"Obsessed, deserves everything, best game every, can never get bored. A simple farming game but with lots of story to it, many things to do at all times and is very relaxing unless your in the mines, at that point stress levels are high."
3227,"if you marry anyone other than emily you are the scum of the earth and time will forget you

3228,I farm stuff. I fish. Life is good.
3229,"Imagine Minecraft but with a different life to it.  Not mining 50,000 blocks.  A lot more story and interesting characters to it.  Something I can play for an hour or two after work, even when I'm tired.  Very relaxing game."
3230,fun
3231,"my husband fed my two babys pizza cereal  and pizza for lunch, no one looks after them, theyre gonna die"

3234,"Pucked up this game cuz the bf wanted a game we could play together, we played probably 20-ish hours, then completely dropped it. I picked it back up years later, and within the last month, I have dumped over 200 hours into this game. It has me in a choke-hold. I don't have time for anything else. I haven't seen my family in weeks. send help. 10/10 would definitely recommend"
3235,I like chinken

3254,"Great game, I was instantly hooked! So much detail and so much to do you could never be bored. It also involves you with a unique experience with characters where you can form relationships/friendships with them.I highly recommend, have had almost 20 hours on it and bought it 2 days ago!"
3255,An amazing game.
3256,"First time paying for a game on steam and it's money well spent. Very addicting and you can play it however slow or fast as you like. There are some minor inconvenient things about it like your character tilling or watering the wrong spot despite clicking it, needing to rummage through a bunch of chests to look for certain items needed for crafting etc. but it doesn't take away from the overall game play. Honestly, just a fun and relaxing game about farming. I recommend skimming through the wiki for basic info. since there isn't really a tutorial, but it's also cool to not and just find out as you play."
3257,Very fun and entertaining game
3258,This is one of the most chill and fun games ever.
3259,very cool and unexpected depth to gameplay and world building. co-op is good for nerdy couples.
3260,a
3261,I love it.
3262,"Definitely one of my favorite games. There is lots to do even when you hit relative endgame, especially now that they added that crazy little island to steal resources from. For me it isn't very replayable, I kind of hate playing a new file and having to deal with how slow and annoying everything is, but that isn't a problem when you first start - it's just because I have a file I've been playing on for years. The characters are cute and likeable, as well as most of them having compelling stories or depth which is nice. I could say a lot more but to be brief - it is a very good game"
3263,fun
3264,sweet and interesting without any pressure!
3265,Great Game Its my all time favorite!
3266,"This game is so relaxing and so much fun, I am hooked!"

3281,"Very good game, relaxing, addictive and keeps you coming back. I had it on mobile and found myself challenged the experience on the computer is not any different. Would recommend."
3282,"I played 500+ hours on switch before getting Stardew Valley on steam, and this is still one of my favorite games ever. Its hard to express what this game means to me personally, but it is so worth giving your time and love to. ConcernedApe has done an astounding job with Stardew and Im so excited for Haunted Chocolatier! 

tldr; amazing game with hundreds of hours of content, made single handed by an awesome game dev who really knows how to make a great gaming experience"
3283,cute farming game or whateva. has good plot
3284,"Absolutely addictive game. I've gotten friends to play this. I mostly play on my nintendo switch, since i like the portability, however it's one of my favourite cozy games. there's a wide modding community for when gameplay needs to be freshed up :)"
3285,this game is so good i play it with my eyes closed before i fall asleep
3286,yes.
3287,Very good

3299,yes
3300,"I have been playing this for years. I am a 66 yr old great grandma, one of the original gamer's,  who loves a challenge this game is as challenging as you want it to be.  It offers a wide variety of tasks to keep everyone busy and happy at their own pace. There is no hurry and lots of reward. I love the update with the island. My favorite towns person is the DR. I marry him every time even though hes a nervous submissive kind of guy he is faithful and does more than most in town. I like  the fishing it does have a bit of a learning curve though."
3301,This is literally my top most favorite game I've ever played. 10/10
3302,cool game
3303,i like it
3304,every great game has fishing
3305,cutest game ever and so easy to get pulled into it
3306,Definitely my new favourite game! There are so many different things to do and different ways you can play. Very well made npcs that you can get attached to and very interesting stories/lore. 100% worth the money!
3307,A relaxing game to play after a long hard day. The idea that tomorrow will not be as boring as yesterday makes you continue. I recommend this game to everyone who wants to calm a little bit and to anyone that wants a different experience!

3320,"There is definitely something for everyone. You go at your own pace and there is a number of things to do. You can be strategic, fast pace, or just in it for a chill game, its for anyone. I would totally recommend Stardew Valley if you like options and different way's to play a game. I don't recommend Stardew Valley if you dislike sandbox games."

3327,very good
3328,This game is very good in my opinion. I have played it a lot more on console and I have found it very fun while playing because I like slower paced games and I can see why some people wouldn't enjoy the slow paced nature of the game or how it gets repetitive sometimes but I would highly recommend his game to most people.
3329,very nice

3331,mmmm
3332,"I love this game! It's my go-to comfort game, and even when I fall out of it fr a bit, i always come back to it. It's so soothing and sweet. Highly recommend!"
3333,"There is something addicting and calming about Stardew Valley that's hard to explain. 
The game can seem boring in the beginning, but the planning out the day to conserve stamina/energy as well as making sure not to stay out late all becomes part of the fun. 

The characters have really interesting stories as well. I'm sure there are more stories/ hidden things I haven't discovered so super excited to keep on playing. 

Also got my wife hooked on this game as well. 10/10 would take over my dead grandfather's farm"

3374,Absolutely love Stardew Valley and highly recommend it!
3375,"Great game, not as good as starbound is but still good. We need Starbound 2 honestly"
3376,Its ok
3377,It's a fun addicting game that I would recommend to others.
3378,"Great game. Lots of replayablility! 10/10 If you want more content for the game, Download the mod ""Stardew Valley Expanded""."
3379,"I don’t really need to say much, just buy this game. It’s consumed a good portion of my life and I wouldn’t change a thing. 

I also got my mom to buy a gaming computer and she is more obsessed with this than me. Over double the time I have invested and she knows things I’ve never even heard of about the game. I’ve  enjoyed every second playing with her on our farm and is a great way to spend time together. 

Great game to bond over, very wholesome with a friendly UI. Just a great game."
3380,F A R M
3381,good
3382,"Great game to sit back, sip your favourite coffee and relax to! This game has much more to offer than meets the eye!

Quite a timesink if you're hunting for 100% achievements though! <3

"
3383,"most chill game ever
"
3384,"ah yes, escapism."
3385,"Stardew Valley might appear as a basic farming sim but underneath there is a hidden gem of a game. Developed by only one person, this game is made with soul and love and you can see and feel it while you play.

Pros:
- Atmosphere is calming and relaxing.
- Gameplay has a fine line between grind and progress.
- Friendship system and romance. The residents of Stardew Valley have a lot of personality and have heart events which promotes character development.
- Variety of things to do, farming, fishing, mining, combat.
- Multiple options for replayability, new farm layouts, etc.
- Has multiplayer options and in depth option for it.
- Soundtrack is lovely and fits for the game.
- Bundles, which makes you plan ahead and creates self goals.
- Seasons which spice up things with special holidays and events.
- The developer has been pushing free updates and is usually available if help is needed.
- The game is dirt cheap if you compare it to the hours you would put into the game.

Cons
- Can be a bit hard to get into the game at first. The game doesn't tell you what to do and you are on your own. You do get some mini quests that push you into the right direction but I've seen people quit before getting into the game. This can be a con or a pro for people.

Overall, I can't stress enough how much value this game offers. It has so much soul in it and I recommend it for everyone."
3386,Amazing game! I love designing my farm and interacting with the townspeople! This is one of my favourite games ever! My only complaint is with the fishing mechanic. Horrible. I haven't encountered a more frustrating mechanic. The game is fully playable without doing much fishing though so still 10/10!!
3387,"As a Kansan, yes."
3388,Simply the best
3389,"2/10 for not letting me date moms, then i found a mod that DID late me date moms, 10/10 u should play"
3390,Lots to do
3391,Very cute and addictive with a surprising amount of depth.
3392,sam
3393,"My now-husband and I started dating just before the COVID lockdowns of 2020. We spent the first six weeks of our relationship doing nightly Discord calls and playing Stardew Valley in order to spend time together, and I fell for this game just like I fell for him! Stardew is a great blast from the past--reminiscent of my childhood obsession with Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, and other games about farming and/or building community. I love watching all the ways the town changes and new opportunities open up as you meet goals and build relationships."
3394,Great game on any platform. Can be a great relaxing break to a stressful day.
3395,amazing
3396,cool
3397,"If you want the time go fast 
this game is a time machine."
3398,"Absolutely love the game, some of the game mechanics (relationships, grinding, etc) feel very robotic to me, but that is completely understandable as this whole masterpiece was made by one person.

Can't wait for the Haunted Chocolatier!"
3399,"Enjoyable for hours and hours. No pressure, no stress, just do what you want when you want to."
3400,I really like this game and the story line too!!! (: i haven't yet finished the game and don't even know where the end is lol
3401,This game is one of the best games I have ever played because it fells like every area of playstyle is covered if you want to mine you can if you want to fight monsters you can if you want to be chill and farm you can. This game has so much in it that its hard to take it all in especially when it was just made by one guy.
3402,A very cool and normal farming game.
3403,Very entertaining!
3404,pretty cool
3405,"For me, this game is like Terraria+Mineral Town, both of these are my most favourite games. 
Love it!"
3406,"i now have a goth bf and crippling gender dysphoria.

3411,"Great game, fun to play"
3412,"Nice, laid back but very fun game."
3413,.
3414,"The greatest of the Harvest Moon-style farm-sim genre. If you liked literally any Harvest Moon, Rune Factory, Story of Seasons, etc., get this.

If you are new to the genre, some advice: go SLOW. Figure things out on your own. It can be overwhelming if you're trying to play optimally. So don't. There's so many different play styles. Find the one that works for you."
3415,just relax and stay harvest
3416,yeah
3417,very fun lots of content one of my favourite games
3418,Play game for a bit and it was super fun so you should buy it.

"
3432,it masterpiece.
3433,"Stardew Valley is a uniquely wonderful experience that will test your ability of time management, organization, and memory. There is a reason it is one of the most love games on all the platforms its available on, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. There are mechanics in it like the fishing that will test your patients, but rewards you if you take the time to master it. The world itself is full of interesting places, people, and experiences that make you appreciate the time you put into the game. The mod community has created many amazing mods to help you create a unique experience for yourself, and the game is one that you will find yourself keep coming back to once you've played it. For the price it is a game that you will sink more time in than any triple A game, and the pixelated design of the game really works well.  It's a game both friends, and family can enjoy together without worry and that alone makes it incredible. "

3443,Very addicting and fun to play with friends.
3444,in a few words... BEST GAME IN HISTORY
3445,"I had Stardew Valley on my switch but I love this game so much that I bought it on PC as well It's only been one day since I bought the game and I already have 10 hours in this game straight. I feel like that says something about the game. very fun, very engaging, good characters, good environment. and a great community. I definitely reccomend this game"
3446,fun innit
3447,"Great pixel art and synth music, looks like an older console game, plays like a modern crafting game with a focus on farming. The dungeons and mini games are fun too. You can advance your tech so you don't have to repeat the boring work  of planting / harvesting. Raising animals is fun but could be more involved. The simplicity allows for relatively short play sessions for busy people. Can stop and save relatively easy."
3448,Yes
3449,it go brrrrrrrr
3450,Lovely game. Will keep you playing for hours when you only meant to hop in 20 minutes if you're not careful.
3451,fun game the maker of this game makes well made games 10/10 you should get it

3466,Chikmin
3467,"Stardew valley isnt only fun but relaxing. You not only get to expand your farm but your friendship and knowledge of the NPC's in the game aswell. You can give yourself challenges to make it more amusing, whether that be completing the community center in year one to settling down and having a family. Or you could take it to the next level and be like my amazing friend Moogle and attempt 100% in just a couple years of the game. It's great to play with friends and even alone. Highly recommend!"
3468,"Probably my absolute comfort game. Has kept me up many a night because ""Oh, I just gotta do this one last thing and then I'll close the game""."

3477,"Such a cute game! All the characters are so loveable and super pretty. You can try and pursue all the eligible bachelors with their own little cutscenes and special dialogue with you. Haley's character development makes her the best wife <3 The gameplay is quite easy but still you can't really be bored with loads of characters to meet, mines, wood to chop down, and completing the community center, and load of other quests. You can also add mods which I totally recommend if gameplay gets too repetitive by like year 87. its such a cute game tho and super wholesome"
3478,Farm. Animals. Hmmmmmmmmmm. Yeah.
3479,Cool
3480,"yup good, you can loose yourself in this game for hours on end lol"

3484,"This game is relaxing and pretty sophisticated.  Only issue is the difficulty with figuring out what to do sometimes but it comes with experience.  Good game, worth buying."
3485,amazing game. v relaxing

If you want a good review of the game, you're at the wrong place. However, If you're looking for a super simple, comforting, no-frills bowl of spaghetti and meatballs, you've come to the right place.

INGREDIENTS:
1 lb. spaghetti
1 lb. ground beef
1/3 c. bread crumbs
1/4 c. finely chopped parsley
1/4 c. freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving
1 large egg
2 garlic cloves, minced
Kosher salt
1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes
2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 c. onion, finely chopped
1 (28-oz.) can crushed tomatoes
1 bay leaf
Freshly ground black pepper

DIRECTIONS:
1. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until al dente. Drain.
2. In a large bowl, combine beef with bread crumbs, parsley, Parmesan, egg, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and red pepper flakes. Mix until just combined then form into 16 balls.
3. In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer meatballs to a plate.
4. Add onion to pot and cook until soft, 5 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Return meatballs to pot and cover. Simmer until sauce has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.
5. Serve pasta with a healthy scoop of meatballs and sauce. Top with Parmesan before serving.

Hope this helped!"

3502,The great game ever!!
3503,I really enjoy goal-oriented games.  This game could be better if instructions were given and accessible throughout play.  Graphics are well-done.  I especially like that i can play with others too.
3504,"Not enough moon, too much harvest. 7.8/10"
3505,I have literally been playing this nonstop since it came out in 2016 and I have another 300 hours in the mobile version sooooooooo
3506,"cute, charming, and plenty of replay value or just Continuing a current game well past year three, Stardew Valley is a great little game and the Dev is very supportive of the moding community as well! 

I have purchased this game on pc, mobile, and my Switch."
3507,animal crossing but better and more farm-based

3513,"No pie recipe sorry, good game tho. The wiki is your best friend."
3514,"An amazing game with amazing characters. Incredibly fun, 10/10 easily.
The literal only thing I disliked about Stardew Valley is that I wish there was a way to increase inventory space later in the game, as once you get to Ginger Island and Skull Caverns it's really easy to fill up your inventory.
Otherwise, no complaints. I've thoroughly enjoyed the game and I really do think it's a game that everyone should at least give a chance. The heartwarming cutscenes, interesting dialogue, town festivals, new locations, everything- It just makes for an amazing game.
"
3515,"The one game that gives me sense of 'continuity'. ConcernedApe has achieved such a immersive layering with this masterpiece. Every interaction, relationship, growth... It feels like belonging somewhere.

Also... It helped me with organization and sense of time (since I have ADHD, it is a huge thing, hehehe)."
3516,Good game.
3517,very nice
3518,"I am addicted. Sometimes after playing, I close my eyes and see Stardew Valley; then, I continue to play Stardew Valley *but in my mind ooooooo*

I love this game tho. It's so cool, so grindy, so nice. I do recommend watching some videos prior to playing tho. Apparently, people consider Stardew not user-friendly because there's no in depth tutorial. So, if you don't have like.. common sense ig LOL.. you should watch a youtube video or two"
3519,yes
3520,"so relaxing, really fun."
3521,its fun to play with friends
3522,"I love this game! I was a bit skeptical at first, but my friend convinced me to play. This game gives me a break from the garden in real life. It's an immersive adventure-filled, creative gameplay that I rarely see these days. Most games also don't support much modding, but Stardew is so chill. Highly recommend!"

3539,Fun game with the bois. (Thumbs Up)
3540,Very very fun!! I absolutely adore this game ^^
3541,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING INTO BUYING THIS READ THIS!!!!

First I would like to say back in 2006/2007 I put like 2k hours in Farmville and that was the sh*t. I've been waiting ~15 years for a game like it and I think I finally found it. Stardew Valley. Simply, one of the best farming simulator games out there (Yeah you heard me Farming Simulator). I'm from Indiana so you would know I am a pro at farming and animal harvesting. So take my word when I say this is the game of the century. From planting/harvesting crops to taking care of animals and taking their goods to become efficient to sell. Forging new relationships with the townsfolk is worth it and now I finally have an E-Girlfriend. Abigail. I've sunk 60+ hours in my first week playing this game. 50 hours in my own world and ~12 with my IRL GF ( Don't tell her about Abigail). DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING IT! BUY IT NOW YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! peace."
3542,good
3543,"Stardew Valley is a great game! I do recommend this game to those who like playing farming sims and animal crossing. I personally enjoy playing the game. Stardew Valley has farming, mining, cooking, and even marriage (LMAO). 100% recommend, Stardew Valley is the combo of farm + mine + adventure + people (aka villagers) + exploring. So yes a great game, buy/play the game."
3544,its a slow calm and thoughtful game
3545,I am enjoying this game. it's very addictive and relaxing a nice change of pace if you need a break from other games or just in life. I would recommend this game to anyone who needs a relaxing chill game.
3546,good game can marry my e-husband

3557,It's literally so fun. you can design your farm however you want and talk to NPC's and gain their friendship. 10/10! <3
3558,The 'farming' sim every other farming sim tries to be.
3559,"If you think you might like this game, you'll love it. I have over a hundred hours in this game between Steam and Switch and still haven't come close to doing everything this game has to offer. From farming to fishing to mining and more, this game has a ton to do. The farming mechanic alone is surprisingly deep, without many different crops available every season. While a little grindy at times, seeing you planning and hard work pay off is extremely satisfying and gives you just enough currency to reinvest into upgrades for you farm. The only faults I can find with this game are a relatively shallow set of interactions with the NPCs, and a grind that can feel a little dull at times. Overall, between the charming visuals, relaxing audios and soundtrack, and a rewarding gameplay loop, this game is delightful. I give it a 9/10."
3560,There isn't much for me to say that hasn't been said. Worth the $$$
3561,"Fun with 1, 2, or 3 friends. Big modding community. Modd really makes the game what it is today. I got this game as a gift from a friend, but i had played before on switch. 10/10. really good couple's game."
3562,"A nice casual farming/village life sim, odds are if you're like me and grew up with the Harvest Moon series, then this will be right up your alley."

3605,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer"
3606,good game
3607,"I love this game, if your looking for a chill farming game that doesnt get boring after a day or two stardew is great for you, i got this game a couple of weeks ago and im already on year two :)"

3622,"It's so fun and addicting!
"
3623,"I highly recommend stardew valley to those who love farming sims, especially if you've played the harvest moon + story of seasons games. I will say trying this game for the first time can be rough and confusing. What made me start my stardew obsession was playing the game on a co-op farm with friends that showed me the ropes and how to play. From there I would watch youtube videos, tiktoks, and twitch streamers and it really evolved my love for this game. If the base game gets too repetitive then i recommend trying out mods to increase the options and things you can do and change the experience.

Overall my expereince with this game is super amazing, however I understand these types of games are not everyones cup of tea!

Definitely give it a try first!"
3624,Alex is hot af

3631,"One of the best games I have ever played in my life. And i mean it! If you ever have a phase of ""i dont want to do this"", or ""gaming isnt fun anymore"", PLEASE play this game. I couldnt stop playing when i bought the game and have grinded 100+ hours in the first two weeks. 

This game is a beautiful masterpiece and my biggest wish would be to forget everything about this game, so i can play it again blindly. The music, accompanied with the atmosphere of the valley just guarantees a good time. And dont let its graphics deceive you, because the tiny pixely graphics really fit in with the game and its theme.  

Its 100% worth your time and money."
3632,:D
3633,Super fun and relaxing game
3634,"It is the perfect game!! A great cross between hay day, animal crossing, and minecraft that leaves you with endless options! Fun for any demographic :)"
3635,Honestly one of my favorite games. It's super cute and deeper than I expected. The relationships and character development are amazing and there's always something to do and stuff to learn. It's become a huge hyper-fixation. Playing on multi-player isn't the smoothest since it's difficult to pause and there tends to be at least slight lag in combat.
3636,I cant escape
3637,本当に素晴らしいゲームです
3638,"I love everything about stardew(except fishing, not a fan of that system) and will continue to play it!"

3642,"This game is not only addicting, but it is also therapeutic. I enjoy the repetitive work and the plot is so good. The characters and farm animals are so cute and it gets even better with mods that can enhance the overall aesthetic of the game. Though it requires a lot of work, so if grinding is not up your alley then don't get it!"
3643,"Sometimes, Community Center background noise starts for ""The sewers"" animation with Jas, and Vincent.
Not sure that's supposed to happen."

3652,"I played this game like 4-5 Years ago on my mobile phone, I really like it then I want to buy the game for my steam acc. Now I'm playing with my girlfriend. We really enjoy when we are mining,fishing etc. She is 10/10 but using (WASD) with her 2 hands. I said 2 hands not 2 fingers :')"

3657,"Overrated.
Boring as hell."
3658,"I decided to finally give my thoughts on this game.

Unfortunately, my head is empty.

Very good game. Calm, lots of content, fun co-op."
3659,"Very chill, has a huge modding community"
3660,cute game <3
3661,"I'm not sure that I can contribute anything in this review that hasn't already been said by others elsewhere, but oh well. Yes, it's an open-world RPG, but, as far as I'm concerned, it's better than Skyrim in pretty much every metric other than combat and magic. But the combat is certainly more streamlined and efficient, and Stardew doesn't even need magic. There are endless ways to play, and the replay value is through the roof. There's something to love for very nearly everyone in Stardew Valley. If that doesn't sway you over, hopefully the sheer number of hours everyone has put into it will."
3662,Absolutely love this game! Love completing the Community Centre and seeing the Junimos do their little dances. Would recommend for people who want a nice chill game to zone out on. Their is some combat but not a massive amount mostly just defending yourself when mining.
3663,"This game has become a huge comfort game for me. Its so nostalgic, I have it on almost all of my devices. Just whenever I feel stressed or want to chill for awhile i'll stop and play this game <3"
3664,This game is so relaxing to play. Perfect for an hour of downtime before launching back into our busy lives. Ahhh if only life could be as simple as Stardew...
3665,farming cool
3666,It's the best
3667,Hear me out. they have HAWT EMO BOI!!. ;)
3668,i hate abigail
3669,It's really enjoyable. I can't stop playing it.
3670,"I don't normally go for games like this, but Stardew is genuinely one of the best games I've ever played. The simple yet endearing gameplay and storytelling is incredible, and while there are a few changes I would make (like making the crafting interface left-click only, since I've accidentally double right-clicked on a crafting bench and unintentionally made a cheese press more times than I can count), they are minor and the overall theme and story of this game is impeccable."
3671,"Ive spent maybe 60-70 hours of playing this on the Switch with my friends and the gameplay never felt boring. The artwork is a wonder. To put it simply, so much colour.

I have yet to get to the end-game though, so I'll update if I ever get there."
3672,Yes
3673,"I was very awkward this game, because i know all nothing to do. So I was asked my girlfriends knows how to play these and shes said 'I been experience thats before' so shes teach me to how to farming, chopping the axes, and sell a restock for fishing, copper, and more etc; and shes showed me how to refilled the waters so i kept to learning a progresses. Been having fun with my girlfriends to playing 'Stardew Valley' and in my option and it very almost likes Terreria because it's haves same as graphic with pixel. Would recommending this games 8.5/10"

3682,good but remember to go outside and touch grass every once in a while :)
3683,"Greatly addictive on deck reminesint to when I started in ACNH, will update once more time logged"
3684,it good
3685,"It has the farming mechanics we're all used to but there are also quests, fighting, and mine delving. What I absolutely love is the crafting. I CAN MAKE SPRINKLERS. For anyone who's built a large farm on any farming simulator, you know how being able to automate some of the monotonous chores like watering can really make or break a game. Also, there's an elevator in the mine. I don't have to grind all the way down to a certain level to get the ore I need! Beautiful. The variety of monsters in the mine also keeps the mining from getting monotonous or boring. Here's some advice for anyone just starting, when you get to level 30 in the mines, start bringing torches with you. Lots of torches. You're going to need them."
3686,THE BEST!
3687,farming yay :)
3688,"It's a farming simulator with mining, foraging, helping a town against a corrupt mayor, and even a dating sim snuck in. If you're not sure check out a review..... and then cave, buy it, and realize that one of the many bachelors and bachelorettes has stolen your farmer's life as you scroll through the wiki to find out how to marry them."

3722,"This game will always remain perfect and timeless. I cannot express how well made this game is. Eric, keep up the AMAZING work"
3723,such a simple yet entertaining game
3724,"This game is great. My brother recommended it to me a couple years back and I have been obsessed ever since. I have many hours on Nintendo Switch combined with my multiple PC's. I love Stardew Valley so much. I definitely recommend learning how to mod. It seems threatening but it is actually very easy once you get the hang of it, plus it makes the game so much better. Some people complain about having to use the wiki too much but I don't mind it."
3725,Honestly the best grindy game ive played. 10/10 would reccommend if you have no life
3726,"WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! 
I get bored of games really easily, and never play them again. But with Stardew, I can go months without playing and I'll always come back. You REALLY get what you pay for with this game. Trust me."
3727,hehe farming go brrr
3728,"Fun for farming
"
3729,"Lovely, speechlesssss"
3730,"I've bought this game on Pc, Xbox and Switch.

It's that good it's worth 3x or even 10x the price. Will go down as the most well rounded farming game of all time with endless content. Extremely good multiplayer progression and you never feel like a second player in the world.

The game goes at a perfect pace for a long term game and there is always something to do. 10/10 and a must play for anyone into farming or simulation games."

3762,pet cat
3763,Best farming sim ever. Wish I could play it for the first time all over again. Only thing I would change would be to make mods more accessible.
3764,"ngl a very good game, would rate 11/10, but it has Sam in it so i have to take away 1 point. I used to like Sam, but he's a useless piece of shit. what did i expect when one of his best gifts is literally trash, a joja can. You are what you eat. 

He looks decent until you interact with him and see a zoom in off his face and rat-tail hair. there is no way he's a teenager, he looks like a middle aged man who never left home. you'd think him having the sweetest little brother, would have even the slightest bit of personality, but no. sam is not pog.

all over all, my rating of this sun of a gun emotional rollercoaster game is 10/10. NO U ARE TOO INVESTED !
"
3765,"I usually make silly reviews, but this one is really different. There are so many things to say about this game. 

The art style is wonderful and pleasing to look at while also being simple pixel art. The world is just so vast, so many quests and secrets to uncover. The gameplay is satisfying and addicting, putting in a hard days work on the farm, the mines, or the forest and seeing the money rack up. The social part is really nice, there are so many npcs to befriend and learn more about. So many things to learn and unlock. AND CUSOMIZATION. The customization was really the point that got me into the game. Something about building my own farm however I want in nearly every way really is worth the money and hours I'm putting into this game. Overall its a very in-depth game, I can spend several hours of my day playing this.

3771,"I adore this game. It can be chill, it can be action-packed, it can be cute, it can be sad - Stardew Valley has the ability to fit just about any mood. It's also new-player friendly and wildly complex for those that want to spend the time on all the little details. Cannot recommend enough."
3772,"you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
3773,"There's really nothing like this game, there's only imitations, but you will never find another title that has everything Stardew Valley has. It checks every box for me and I haven't found anything similar to it ever since."
3774,This game does indeed take place in Stardew Valley

I spent almost 6 days in this game and still playing it and still enjoying. You should play this 2d masterpiece. 👍"
3778,The only game that will suck you into pulling things repeatedly from the ground while also tugging at your heart strings. Forgive my sins for I will play this game until I run myself into an early grave.

3780,oooooo gamr

3805,"I only have 16 hours on record for the PC version, but have played more than 100 hours between other platforms - including the Nintendo Switch.

This game is an absolute steal for the few bucks that it costs. I yet have to meet someone who played Stardew Valley and was not completely blown away by it. This does not have to be your cup of tea, as it typically wouldn't be mine, and I fell in love with it all the same. This game is just so full of things to do and explore and is addicting in the very best way. It never seizes to amaze me that one person was responsible for all of this. On top of that, there is a very active modding scene that delivers free content that can easily stretch the longevity of Stardew Valley by many hours.

With the greediness and cynicalness of big studios, ConcernedApe is a breath of fresh air. If Stardew Valley intrigues you I would honestly just give it a try. The worst that can happen is that you give a very modest sum of money to an indie developer who truly cares about his customers and puts his heart and soul into his work. With all the money I have wasted on EA I honestly don't find that a bad trade-off."
3806,It is very fun and interesting and you should consider getting it!
3807,"Cute little farming game, but still has some weird shit going on between marnie and Major Lewis ngl. also Emily >>>>> every other girl (explict Penny). Was pretty much very funny except the island/munkey update. very weird shit going on there."

3817,"I don't know what to say. 
But this game is fricking cool."
3818,"God, I don't think that I have ever played something as long as this game. It has both the addicting gameplay of an incremental game and at the same time it has a soul. One of the best non-AAA games I've played, for sure! (the only thing that's bugging me is the fact that I can't get the last two achievements (king of the Prairie)) Also Linux support is very cool. I don't even know how dlls run on this thing, but it's great!"

3832,"I am a single mother to my 2 son's. It has been rough ever since our house burned down in a tragic California wild fire. This game reminded us what its like to live in a house, as we have been homeless ever since the tragedy. One of my favorite characters from this game is Pam. She reminds me of myself as I am a struggling alcoholic who fails to provide for my children. Anyways, this game has helped me and my children through hard times. Would recommend!!"

3834,Great game for grinding and having relaxed fun.
3835,"this game is so fun and cute!! it offers a lot of different avenues you can explore and there is no true set ""path"" that players must take, as you can pretty much just go at your own pace and choose to progress in whatever way you desire. i would also like to mention how satisfying a lot of the sounds are in this game and how they complement the art style. everything is just very charming and cute in stardew-- would definitely recommend."

3873,"Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03’ tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able handle human dicкs, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have seх with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dicк. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cоck all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more"

3879,\i love it so much! Its a cute game and does not get boring like other games i have played in the past. \the only thing i wish is that in the creation screen there was more genders. \as a non-binary person i hate having to choose a gender.

3881,Very fun. Pixely
3882,Super fun for casual play and grindy play.
3883,"good game, fixed my depression and got me laid"
3884,This is a fun relaxing game that is best played co op with a friend. The days pass really fast which does make it hard to make much progress in the game. Hence why it is best to play this with multiple players.
3885,relaxing
3886,Played on Xbox originally but it was so fun I bought it on steam too

3903,"there is nothing unexpectable when you play this game, if you cant do something there is always someone explaining it on the internet and the fact that this game can run smoothly in a potato is an plus aswell. Oh ofc let's not forget how easy it is to mod this game and the options you have some of the huge mods are: ridge side village and stardew valley expansion ofc there is many quality of life mods you just gotta choose the ones you like."

3909,"I like how many different options there are to make money and spend your time. You can get to know townspeople and complete requests with people, you can farm, fish, mine, forage and find random stuff to sell, and all sorts of other things."
3910,"This was the first game I played when I created my Steam account, and it was basically my gateway drug to PC indie games! I love SDV sooo much. :)"
3911,I love the game. It has great replay value - especially if you try it out with mods afterwards. I've spent a lot of hours playing this and will always come back to it after breaks from it.
3912,terraria v2
3913,it's like harvest moon but better.
3914,"If you want a 2D farming sim with RPG elements and some minor monster fighting, this is the game, nothing else compares, also has an active modding scene thats adds alot more content with near infinite playability."
3915,Definitely a game I'm glad I got into. I love the simplicity of it and yet there is so much to it. I played it for years and I'm still finding stuff that I've never seen before.
3916,"aside from the god awful map and the lack of fast travel the game is pretty good, its has a mod community too

edit: after 90h of  playtime i almost finished a save file, my first two point stands which i did fix with mods,but late game sucks, ginger island is just walking around searching for wallnuts and qi gem farm is way too slow for its minimal rewards i use SVE and i still haven't reached crimson lands but late game its so boring specially if ur already married and have kid, by that time u prob have a functional farm that gives u tons of money, also volcano and skull cavern has no Bosses, just generic mobs which means the whole game has 1 ""miniboss"" which is a bigger slime, i still recommend the game tho, it just that the late game needs more work, maybe more rare stuff, actual bosses , more event with your wife(seriously all she does is standing my house doing nothing), more events with general npcs and so on, i will try to fix my issues with mods and edit this review later"

3942,vry swag
3943,i love this game i play it with my friend and we get married very good game
3944,I love this game :)
3945,"I got most of the achievements in this game via the Switch version, but I had to get this on the PC to play with mods. Worth it. Some of the available mods really improve the game and do a lot to expand it's already awesome content. I'd recommend playing with the Stardew Valley Expanded mod to see if you like it. SDV is an incredibly wholesome, magical, and surprising game that can be as stressful or as casual as you care to make it. Highly addicting, but in a way that will upgrade your life on this planet."
3946,"This is one of the best games i've played, it's so relaxing and fun to make my own farm as well as my future as you can interact with all the towns folk and creating romances and friendships. such a good game definitely recommend it to everyone!"
3947,"I'm sure it's a good game,but its not for me."
3948,"Game is cute, there is so much to do on your farm, you don't actually HAVE to farm. You want to work the mines and make money that way, go ahead. Want to fish and earn your living there, it's available. The graphics are great and the characters are quite lovable."
3949,it has sex
3950,bad
3951,The best cozy game I have ever played!
3952,delicious game
3953,"i like that its a slow pased game that i can go back to whenever. the storylines are cool, and also the pixle art style as well. i have a lot of fun fishing, mining, and farming and it acts as a good strees relevier were i dont need to think mutch. however wall all the other seasons are fun i find witer to be kindof boring. its also a bit anoying having to whait an entire day to give more gifts and having to go all the way back to my house bed and change the day to save the game. fun to play by my self and others and love the festavels. game was relitivlly cheep and worth the cost. i would recomend."
3954,"cool game 
"
3955,Brings back memories from playing harvest moon as a kid. This game is calming and can help pass the time when bored or taking a short break from the world.
3956,"Okay if you think stardew valley is just a regular farming simulator type of game, you cannot be any more wrong. It is so good. The amount of intricate details that was put into this game is amazing. It is such an enjoyable game and I couldn't fathom a single person disliking it. The villagers are so well made. Each and every one has their own unique backstory and characteristics. Me and my friend are currently attempting to befriend Shane and Sebastian and we have discovered so many little things about their characters. It is always obvious just how much work the developers have put into this game. The visuals are extremely beautiful. The game is enjoyable whether you're playing alone, or with friends. It has easily became one of my most favorite video games since I bought it. It is very much worth the $20. There is always something new to discover with this game. It was such a magical experience for me and I have already recommended all of my friends to buy this game."
3957,Nice
3958,"Good game to chill, or get mad at horrendous fighting system. But mostly chill and fun, 8/10"
3959,"This game is, quite simply, one of the more pure-fun gaming experiences out there. The world feels rich and alive, the different elements of gameplay all fill a distinct role in the game, and you can choose to specialize in any of them, or do it all. There are really no hard deadlines in the game--Didn't complete a special order? Oh well, it'll be back. Knowing this lets you play the game as carefree as you choose. There is also an absolutely massive list of mods to enhance and even completely overhaul the game. Easily hundreds of hours of fun to be had."
3960,"It is a very fun game with a lot of depth, there is a learning curve when you first start playing but for me- someone who enjoys discovering and research- it is the perfect game. The sprites are charming and the day by day system gives a structure I enjoy. 
There is almost no n game deadlines or strict guidelines so you an explore at your own pace and enjoy your time in the valley. I would recommend it for people who want a fun but grindy game to pass the time with."
3961,I had fun playing Stardew with my friends
3962,"It's great fun, loads of different things to do and approaches to take. Really enjoy it."
3963,"You've got to try it. If you had told me before I played this game that I would love a farming simulator I would have said you were crazy.  But this game is so much more than a farming simulator. it's got heart and soul, it's fun, challenging, and is great to play casually or to deep dive and spend hours on.  Give it a try you will not be sorry."
3964,I love this game. I find it very relaxing (unless I have to go into the mines) and think it's a great way to spend some time.
3965,"This game is like life's itself and the best experience you can have from it is possible if you play it without knowing anything. Start as a baby, grow up, bring memories and once you're satisfied with the result you have, just die. You will end up with looking to your behind with a warm smile and just remembering how you improved yourself in your journey at least that was how it felt in my first playing experience and i was totally satisfied.

 I won't give any specific information about game to criticize it because you should learn them by yourself if you're new to this game but i will talk about somethings.

 First of all this game is literally warm, chill and absolutely not a hardcore game. If you want to enjoy it you should give your time -a lot of time- and just leave it to it's flow. Although you can play it with the most optimum way, it wouldn't be that much fun tbh.

 You will make mistakes, you will not be sure about something and this will make you a bit stressed. Yes these are will happen because you don't know anything about the game. You're just here to be a farmer and with the mistakes you will make you will also learn how to be a proper farmer and this is what i was talking about in the first paragraph. Just do not restart to the game just because of single mistake you will regret it, trust me.

 Normally, not any game genre is suitable for every type of player, i believe to this tbh but i recommend this game to every kind of player, every single one of them. It's fun"
3966,im cute
3967,It's a relaxing game inspired by classic Harvest Moon games.

(all in all it's a good game)"
3974,"This game is so beautiful! The soundtrack is amazing, and even though at times, it can be monotonous, it's a lovely game that I play to calm me down!"
3975,Solid game with wizards and shit
3976,amazing game
3977,Best game ever even if it takes 10 min for my cheese of a laptop to load
3978,Just the perfect relax and play with friends game. Slight lack of guidance in the beginning but that's what gets you invested in learning the game. Wouldn't call it the best first choice but if you're just looking for a game to not take too seriously and blow some time for fun its perfect!
3979,nice
3980,"One of the best if not the best farming simulators.

In addition to that it's possible and really fun to play in multiplayer. All in all it's (subjectively) a great game. :D I can only recommend it!"

At first i hated combat and fishing (especially fishing) but once you get the hang of it it can eventually be another enjoyable task. Perfection is very hard I've spent around 200 hours working towards it and I'm still only 50% done. This game is cute and simple and also challenging and engaging.

4018,"This was a game that I only bought to play with my friend. I though ""oh a farming sim sounds soooo boring."" and now this is one of my favorite games of all time. I will warn everyone, it's shockingly addictive."
4019,"Stardew Valley balances its RPG and Farming Simulator elements surprisingly well, allowing you a real sense of progression as you grow relationships with NPC’s and your Farm becomes much more profitable. With a few fun challenges thrown in if you're willing to look for them, Stardew Valley creates a relaxed gameplay experience that allows the player the freedom to explore any of its niches, and improve anything they want to."

Despite it is price, the real value cannot be calculated by using the price."
4056,Minecraft but better????
4057,"This is a fun cross of farming, fighting, and socialising. Lots of in-game hours to do the quests and also set up your farm over the seasons until it's just the way you like it."
4058,"This game is a really good example of how the pacing of an interactive medium of art helps shape the emotions that are in evoked by it, even if the pacing is set by the player themself. I believe it demonstrates how patience of impatience can dictate a game experience."
4059,"I keep coming back to this game no matter how many times I've played it before. I bought it for my switch, on my phone and also on steam. It's such a lovely little game :)"
4060,good game
4061,mmmmm plant
4062,Its super fun:)
4063,just being a little farmer
4064,mmmm mayonnaise
4065,"Addictive ASF, play if you love a good game"
4066,This game is so much fun to play either multiplayer or by yourself! There are so many different things to do to keep you entertained! I could play this game for hours!
4067,"Great game to play to help relax, very chill."
4068,"An absolute masterpiece of video game history. The farming simulation of this game destroys Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, Farming Sim (any of them), and even Story Seasons/Rune Factory. The dating sim rivals the likes of the smashing BAFTA awarding-winning cinematic masterpiece ""Come Home"" and even puts shame on games like Danganronpa, Somethings in The Air, and Dating Ariana. The combat is fucking atrocious, do not touch this game if you expect to fight a lot of monsters. I love combat. The plot for Stardew Valley will encapsulate the dopamine receptors of your mind and allow you to actually become sentient. Just when you think this game has ended, it will call you back in with new locales and daunting adventures writhed in progression. If you think this is horseshit, check my playtime and check my achievements. I love this game so dearly that I 100%'d it. If you think this game isn't for you, stop, this game is likable by nearly anyone on the planet if you focus your attention on the content you associate with and it may even have the chance to make you enjoy other things in the game like the farming. Personally, my gateway to the game was fishing but later led me to combat/mining and later to forging/farming. I enjoy all of the professions in the game equally after obtaining perfection. I encourage you to try this game, especially at any of the price tags the game normally stands around. The amount of time and enjoyment that can be experienced in this game solo or cooperatively is outstanding considering that concernedape is a one-man team."

4079,Really peaceful game that you can get lost in for hours. It can also be super overwhelming at times too so that game doesn't get boring. This is my fifth time buying this game on a different device
4080,"Fun!I Interactive! Friendly easy farming game with FISHING! Skills and character development withon-going

4098,"absolute CLASSIC!!! I love this game, it is such a nice game to play after a long day. 10000/10 :)
"
4099,Its a really good game(:
4100,It's a game where you forget what you had planed for the day.
4101,Fun
4102,Stardew Valley is relaxing and fun.
4103,I own this game on multiple platforms and enjoy it on each one. It is a very relaxing little farming game good for anyone wanting some chill vibes.
4104,"Honestly, this is one of the most addictive games I've ever played. No matter how many times I play & no matter how many times I decide to make a new save on a whim, repeating the same process over and over. I never get tired of it. It's a really cool game where you can decide to spend the day decorating, befriending the townsfolk, farming, or adventuring through the mines and the different locations you can unlock as you progress through the game. I haven't completed the game yet, but I definitely will keep playing this for a long time whether I finish it or not. I can't wait for Concernedabe's next game to come out."
4105,phenomenal.
4106,I love that this game is basically Harvest Moon with combat elements.
4107,"Melhor jogo!
Pra quem jogou Harvest Moon no SNES ou no PSX vai se sentir em casa, nostalgia pura. É a mesma parada, só que com muitas melhorias, melhor jogabilidade, novidades, fazendo ficar ainda mais interessante"
4108,Best game
4109,"If, like me, you're still not emotionally over the clusterfuck that is the current state of Harvest Moon, then Stardew Valley is for you."
4110,"fun game
"
4111,1100 hours must i say more
4112,"Have I ever technically finished the game? No. 
Have I restarted my farm multiple times? Yes. 
Is that because the game is bad? Absolutely not. 

I genuinely love this weird, quirky little game. Every time I play there's something new and different, and the QOL updates it's gotten over the years I've played it have made it more and more enjoyable every time I open it up."
4113,"My husband specifically avoided telling me about this game because he knew when I started, I would be lost to it's clutches. xD And he was right!  I absolutely love the peacefulness, the farm life and the very minor fighting that happens in the mine.  Still can't get the hang of fishing, but I'm sure I will eventually!"
4114,gay
4115,"Stardew Valley is a calm farming RPG. Live the country life and meet your neighbors. It's like real life, but better because you can turn it off."
4116,Very calming and lovely game

4126,"BRO ITS THE MOST CHILL GAME EVER

10/10

PLAY ALWAYS"
4127,"one of my favourite games of all time and i have been gaming for 30 plus years. It is a great stress reliever and was very helpfull when i was struggling with severe anxiety and depression. if you play on PC or Android there is also great replayability with the mountain of awesome mods available. would recommend to everyone.
The only negative is if you have been playing for some time then it can get a bit repetitive (which is the same for all games really) but if you can add mods it can add new content."
4128,It's pretty gud.
4129,"I absolutely love this game.  I helps me forget about real life.  I have to be careful though, or this game will consume my whole life."
4130,"I'll just play one more day cycle before I quit. Maybe one more day. Okay, just one more day before..."
4131,dude. just play it. you shall thank me later
4132,peak
4133,"If you're thinking about playing Stardew Valley, do it. This game is the best farm simulator to play."
4134,"1.5 on mobile is still a long way to go, so I have to restart all over again on PC (and for mods, ofc).
It's quite a good way to escape reality, you can literally forget everything and dive into a simple, cozy life, 10/10 would recommended for all ages."
4135,Noice
4136,I LOVE MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK THE COMMUNITY CENTER AND THE GUESTS!~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you can win the game with just money alone no farming needed 10/10
4137,"I absolutely love this game. A wonderful little farming simulator with a cute community. 
Only thing I would complain about is not being able to break up the families and marry the mothers, specifically Robin and Caroline. 
Regardless, I first purchased this on the switch, on which I had 400 hours, until I got more involved in the community and found out about mods. I am one of the mod hoarders now, although the game is just as enjoyable without any. If you ever happen to grow bored of the game though, when you've already explored everything, there are some wonderful mods out there adding tons of new stuff! 
Concerned Ape is a wonderful gaming developer and I am very exited for his new game, Haunted Chocolatier, until then I am very content to keep playing stardew valley"
4138,sooooooooo cool I love trhis game and its so fun and chloe rocks hi its aimee  heyyyqyyyy  go video gamwes I lovew  video games I love charlie runestand  tooooooooooooo life ius so fun im crunk yoooooooo god blewss alex jannone

4140,"pixel farming sim, maybe a bit too much grinding"
4141,I hate everyone but i love this game.
4142,Very relaxing while listening to Kanye. I liked the sprinklers and the cows cuz you can name them pretty silly things like Lil Tay or Nike.
4143,"Really relaxing and really fun. I played this for hours on end since there's so much to do with talking to the NPC's and learning their stories, going mining and adventuring in the different mines, doing little quests, tons of collecting, farming, crafting, and so much more. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes relaxing and wholesome games."
4144,"its pretty good
"
4145,"I love this game so much that I've been playing it every time I can. You can play it at your own pace, whether you're alone or with friends, it's really fun and chill. I also love the amount of features in it and the things that we can do as a player. I've been watching and reading strategies for help to improve my game play and my game overall via the SDV community. I'll continue to support this and ConcernedApe's upcoming games!"

4161,Yeah
4162,"U start the game as a little farmer and after time, u can make friends, marry and build your own farm with ingame ""coins"".. It takes a bit time to get through and understand, but its fun to play. Also the graphics remind me of old nintendo games.."

4171,"If you like playing games with friends, then this is the game I suggest for you."

"
4195,great sht
4196,enjoyable game if you are looking for something that is more relaxing
4197,"We all know what this game is. And its amazing. Farming sim, have relationships with everyone. 10/10 game. Would not necessarily recommend marrying shane unless you want an insecure partner who ""Waters some crops"" and ""Checks around the farm to make sure everything is ok"" once a month/week. But neither here nor there its a great game and I have no real marriage regrets."
4198,some dead game
4199,This game sofar has been pretty good
4200,"Played it for almost 1000 hours on xbox, thought it was good, got it on PC and added mods and I can say its probably my third favorite game besides New Vegas and Rimworld"
4201,Mostly played on the ps4. So many hours in this game. So chill and great to play with friends!
4202,im a girl so i have to like this game
4203,10/10 overthrew capitalism while marrying everyone
4204,Fun happy farming game
4205,Played for many hours between different platforms including Steam. I like it because it has farming but also some darker storylines that it takes a while to discover. Highly recommend for the price
4206,"its an amazing game
"
4207,Its Good!
4208,Great game! Has many things to do and a cute premace. Has multiplayer options! Definitely worth the price.
4209,"A wonderful game, that can be played over and over again. So many things to do and many hours can be spent enjoying the valley. I recommend to all."

4215,it's okay.
4216,"Great game for a chill farming, fishing, and mining, grind!"
4217,Super awesome and relaxing! Just the right amount of reward for your efforts. Reminds me a lot of old school Harvest Moon but with way more content. Also reminds me of Graveyard Keeper but less weird and more wholesome.
4218,TOLERABLE
4219,"cozy :) 
"
4220,Great lighthearted relaxing game.
4221,mm farming game go brr
4222,"I got Stardew Valley a few years ago, and it is currently my most played video game to date. There is so much content, with little to no pressure to complete it; it's all completely at your own pace. The soundtrack is adorable, the characters are lovable, and the gameplay is engaging. 10/10, I regret nothing."
4223,Amazing game a lot of fun to play.
4224,.
4225,it's ok I guess
4226,Muy completo! Muy bonito!

4232,Cow go moo.
4233,"thanks to stardew valley, i have fully developed a southern accent and im cured of all mental turmoil"
4234,"This game is adorable! Don't know why I waited so long to write a review but.. here goes! 

So Stardew Valley gets 10/10. It's such a relaxing, fun game about farming, fishing, meeting new people, going to event, earning money however you want and it is a nice experience away from reality. There is a lot of personality and you can choose however you want to live your life as the farmer and even marry the spouse of your selection! You can have your own dog, going to the mines it's a game to play when you don't want to stress about life. I personally think it is better than Harvest Moon too ^^;"
4235,"yum
"
4236,pixel art is very nice and the game is fun. helps me forget about the horrors that is reality. very good game.
4237,I gave this girl a rock I found and she ate it 10/10 would play again
4238,funny farm game
4239,10/10
4240,calm and fun
4241,What I wouldn't do to get with Pam
4242,i
4243,:)
4244,"Yes
"
4245,"May or may not have become addicted. I'm not the best player, but you don't have to be to enjoy it."
4246,"Stardew is an absolute gem. ConcernedApe is a very nice person for not charging us full price for this game, because they absolutely could. The 23 hours that I've played have been in the last 3 days, and these have been some of the best gaming days in my life. I actually lost my job unexpectedly a few days ago to a layoff and I bought a ""peaceful game"" to cool off a bit. This game helped to make that blow a bit softer. 

Keep in mind, my favorite game is Dark Souls, so this is nothing like what I normally play. However, this is one of the most charming games ever made. You really have to think hard about how to balance your time and energy between day to day activities and getting out there and exploring (yes, there is exploration and combat too). It's all about efficiency - economics too. The game is a little slow to get off the ground, but just hit the farming hard in the beginning and you will find that you have more time to do the quests and all of that. 

Considering this game was made by one person - that person is like fucking mozart of our times. Cudos to you ConcernedApe"
4247,mm yes good game. very good.
4248,The game is very fun
4249,Great farm sim. Hours of fun. Can have many names and different kinds of farms. You never know what you like in tell you try.
4250,"If there is a game anyone can play, its this one.
My girlfriend who has played one other game with me has picked up on this game so quick and we have now been doing this together most days when at home."
4251,"Ah yes, the simple farming simulator, with added monsters, heavy town interaction, mysterious men, cosmic fruit, magic, fishing that your gonna spend all your time doing, and knuckles."
4252,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL YOU WILL LOVE IT GUARANTEED
4253,I like it.
4254,Kegs
4255,Finally girlfriend
4256,I love this game! So relaxing.
4257,"Had a solid 3 years of marriage to Dr.Harvey. We had a beautiful farm, two kids, but I woke up one day just kind of bored with what my life had become. The same routine, ya know. So, I filed for divorce and my kids went *missing*. I talked to Harvey after it all, his response broke my heart and the guilt drove me to erase his memories and pretend nothing happened. I dyed my hair a new color, rearranged my farm and house and started dating other locals, but no one else gives me that cozy feeling inside as much as Harvey did. :/ 

I LOVE this game. The base game is perfect, but if you do wake up bored and don't feel like starting an emotional crisis with your in game partner and kids, there is a massive mod community to help spice up the game more. The sound track was also my Spotify #1 Album of the Year."
4258,parasocial relationships with virtual villagers that you get extremely emotionally invested in go brrr
4259,fun
4260,"Bought this game a long time ago and didn't really give it a chance. Then recently I began playing again, and oh boy, I am OBSESSED. Super feel-good game with cheery pixel graphics, a great little soundtrack, and lots of content to keep you entertained.
Sick of tending crops? Buy & upgrade buildings to raise animals in! Sick of the whole damn farm? Take a day off to go on a mining, monster-slaying adventure! Not the combat oriented type? Why not try fishing? It's unreasonably difficult! 
And if you're done grinding stats, there are numerous NPC quests and friendships to make in town. Hell, why not get married and have your own gaggle of creepy, unaging children, just like everyone else?
Finished the solo game? Invite your friends to explore the different farms available to you in a multiplayer run.

The possibilities are endless with Stardew Valley. 
...Until you explore all of them. But that will take you many hours.

This is probably the most time I've ever spent on anything worth $16.99. A fantastic price for fantastic content."
4261,I love thi sgame it's so relaxing

4265,"Fun, interactive, relaxing!"
4266,rly good game and relaxing to play would 10000000000000000000000% recomend if u like indie games like this :))))))))))))))))))
4267,Great little escapism game.
4268,"I just love how this game is slow paced, as it only demands you to plant crops and water them everyday (at the minimum) to actually play the game. The npcs, art styles, events, seasons, and especially the music make this game lovely as it is.  This game is perfect for busy people, or anyone honestly. I LOVEE YOU ERIIC <33
"
4269,I just can't get enough of this game. Must play after a stressful day.
4270,yes
4271,"Bought the game again after a few years 3 weeks ago and have loved almost every moment, God Dam slimes killed me 2 times. If your wanting a game to play while watching something on yt or Vibing to music I highly recommend this game for it"
4272,.
4273,fun
4274,"Fantastic game, worth the money"
4275,Addictive
4276,"Very fun, addictive game.  Crops, cows, buildings, villagers, dating, quests, monster hunting... Stardew Valley packs in so many things under the guise of a simple farming sim.  With a modding community that is alive and well, the game just keeps rolling and the hours keep slipping by."
4277,pretty alright
4278,"didn't like the part where i needed to farm, but other than that it's pretty good"
4279,"good
game"
4280,"the best game to have ever graced this planet, thank u concernedape for the happy times i love u"
4281,Very calming sim game
4282,"Totally addicted to this game, would recommend you give this a go. if there are any quests you are stuck on, the wiki site is good but then there are so many out there, you couldn't possibly get stuck on one quest or another. there are walk-through's if you feel overwhelmed with making friends or wanting to get items upgraded, there is a kind of order, but, really it doesn't matter. just have fun!"
4283,"Awesome game, fun for all"
4284,Cheaper than therapy! :)
4285,VERY GOOD
4286,"If you like simple games with a good amount of collectibles and achievements,  Stardew Valley is a great time."
4287,<3
4288,I have yet to find stardew in this stardew valley but still a good game
4289,fun
4290,"sandbox games are always fun to turn to when you want a break from your main games. Stardew Valley is very easy to get super invested in, I was hyper fixated on this game and couldn't stop playing it for days but the lore is interesting, kind of dark surprising for the type of vibe this game gives off. It's fun to play!"
4291,"great
"
4292,I love this game yes for blind people to play it takes some modding now i am still looking for a mod that will take down some of the work in cleaning up debris on my farm.
4293,Not bad at all
4294,"great game for playing with friends and solo
the time in the game is implemented a bit toxic, but you can get used to it
8.5/10"
4295,"It's slightly daunting at first, but once you get into the groove, it's so much fun. It's incredibly simple, and yet there is so much to do in. You can do majority of everything in this game at your own pace, and it's up to you how you utilize your days. I love this game, and it's something you can get lost in for hours without realizing you've been playing for that long. If you want a calming, immersive world-game with cute characters and lots, but not an overwhelming amount, to do, then I can't recommend this enough."
4296,Honestly one of the best games ever made. I have purchased this game for at least four different devices and never once regretted it.
4297,haley and i's love is real
4298,"My favorite game, I've bought it for three different devices. The music is otherworldly and I would gladly never return from the Stardrop Saloon."
4299,"This game has consumed my entire life, those hours I have in this game? They are consecutive."
4300,i love you stardew valley
4301,HOOOLLY DUDE THIS GAME IS AWESOME!
4302,1000/10 cured my depression lets me live the dream

4304,"This has got to be the second highest amount of time I have ever put into a singular video game (behind Minecraft) and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. Is there things that could be improved? Of course, every game could have improvements. Such as the combat in this game. But with how much opens up over time, this simply is a game that gets better the more you play. Which is something I don't say lightly.

Overall 10/10, an absolute gem that I am ashamed I didn't play sooner."
4305,Yup.
4306,love everything great game thank u concernedape ur poggers <3
4307,once you start farming you can not stop.
4308,I regret not buying it sooner. An hour in and I knew I was going to go for Perfection. 220 hours later and that was the most fun I've had in a while! 10/10 entered my Top 3 and stole my heart!
4309,good
4310,"A really addictive game
"
4311,corn and chickens
4312,10/10. makes me forget that i'm a stressed uni student.
4313,"I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys grinding and being able to interact with the world around them. It is a nice, relaxing game and is very rewarding as you progress. It makes the game a little more interactive if you decide to add mods, but without mods it is still a very relaxing and fun game."
4314,FarmersOnly.com's biggest competitor.
4315,veri nice game for seritonin :)

4336,"This game is very immersive and can be played whether you are in a good or bad mood, at any level of energy. I recommend it because it has the perfect RPG style and I think other people might like it too. (Posted at 30 hours of playtime)

Edit: I now have over 80 hours, and it seems this game will never get old to me."
4337,no
4338,For when you just want to chill.
4339,I enjoy this game because there are many things to do. sometimes those things make me lazy which is why i dont play much. Yummy star? yes. Fun star? yes. final shark tank score is 2/3.14(48^2).
4340,farm good :D
4341,"its good
"
4342,wow
4343,Its Very Very fun with tons of friends! but its just so overwhelmingly hard to get prismatic shard for real also theres lots of times that the game will crash also including the servers so it needs more fix. also we hope for this game to be able to have mods on steam please!
4344,"Fun game
"
4345,cool beans
4346,Love to farm. good game!
4347,i like farming
4348,This game is so sweet and has a lot of things to do. I enjoy farming and getting to know the npcs in the game as well as the leveling and upgrade system. 1.5 also added more adventures and rewards players can go and look into. A+ game overall.
4349,best game ever
4350,fishing
4351,I have literally spent DAYS playing this game and it's just as satisfying starting from the beginning all the way through late game.
4352,Lovely.
4353,"This game is so relaxing and fun, my only complaint would be a lack of tutorials"
4354,A beatiful capitalism simulator
4355,Amazing game. So much depth to the gameplay through many aspects. Fishing is my life :D
4356,Fun Game. Fun with Mods. Fun.
4357,Perfect game
4358,I will always recommend this game. I love every aspect and have been playing off and on for years.
4359,yes
4360,its good
4361,"Stardew Valley is absolutely beautiful and i recommend it to everyone of my friends. It is super fun to play along or with friends, and you can marry haley, that's a good enough reason to play."
4362,sebastian
4363,epic
4364,ok
4365,i like petting the chickens
4366,can't wait to play tonight with YNH
4367,"Stardew Valley is fun and whimsical with cute, simple animation and relatively simple tasks. This is an amazing stress relief game!"
4368,literally wish this was my life
4369,I like Mr. Harvey Stardew
4370,"Amazing, Interactive, Fun. Loads of content and tons of exploring to do. A fun questing system and great rewards. What more could you ask for in a Sandbox RPG?"
4371,top game. get it
4372,"This game is amazing! I was already a fan of Animal Crossing, so I'm not shocked that I enjoy it as much as I do. It is calming with just enough challenge to not get boring. The problem solving is fun!

In short, this game is like if Minecraft and A.C. had an awesome baby!"
4373,Fun
4374,10/10 good game
4375,"it's a simple made game with a stamina and hp bar (in monster areas), and a save at start of new day style. the game can be modded to enhance things like more rings, or bigger backpack, there even was one for multiple spouses but that hasn't been updated to work with recent updates.. you build relationships with npc's to receive gifts and/or advances in story line. you earn game cash by selling items you find/grow farming, raising animals, cutting down trees, breaking rock, fishing, killing monsters. you can check garbage cans for items once a day each, make sure npc's aren't near you when you do or it gives a small negative to the friendship. junk items can be saved and recycled a little later in the game. there are regular events in the game normally around the mid to end of a season, events give you added chances to gain friendship with npc's. there are puzzles to solve and hidden items to discover. you get to choose from 7 different farm types that effects the home area of the player. there's really not a wrong way to play unless you're going for 100% completion then you'd need to do some of everything.
it's a game with old fashion simple graphics, some story line content is for a more mature player, (such as suicidal thoughts and actions, alcohol use and abuse, homelessness.) but the story lines of NPC's are designed to make you think possible differently of their situations. each npc has a different style, background story, likes and dislikes. there are 12 (6 female 6 male) npc's that you can date and choose to marry (only one unless you divorce the one and choose another or use a mod). there's the starting map area with a cave that has 100 floors, then there's a desert with a cave that's might as well say bottomless, and a island area that has a volcano cave and things to unlock with hidden golden walnuts. you can make one time use teleport totem and later in game large teleport totems for endless use to get to areas faster mountains, beach, farm, desert, island (farm is one time use only).  it is repetitive grinding but you can always choose what you want to do each game day to break up the repetitive grind."
4376,"Chill experience. Always something to do, sometimes too much. But it aight."
4377,"If you enjoy slow paced, chill, cozy games you'll definitely enjoy this! Completely worth the low price and somewhat similar to animal crossing if it was a 2D pixel game. I really like the relationship building and cutscenes that play when you reach a certain point which adds a little bit of story!"
4378,Such a relaxing and in-depth game. Definitely worth it if it seems like your style.
4379,"This game is AMAZING.
Creativity and freedom, yes it has ruined my sleep schedule but if you are looking for that chill game without stress and with lots of possibilities this is for you. Just buy it don't wait to read about it. Also if you watch all of those Stardew Valley Tips videos remember while they give good advice you don't have to go perfect on the first time you play take your time. Figure out what you'll enjoy in the game then play on one of the maps that is more specific to that. Just have fun."
4380,Cute farming sim with a large array of game play features. My favorite in-game past time is hating Shane with every fiber in my body.
4381,"fun game, yeah 
"
4382,yes
4383,cool
4384,do farm. do sleep. repeat. but with story!
4385,no more life just vally
4386,yes
4387,The best part is where you can hit children with rocks and dynamite.
4388,good game.
4389,Didn't expect to get addicted.
4390,Love this game so much
4391,"THIS FKNG SHT IS LAGGING ON TOP PC ON WIN11 I CANT EVEN RUN IT AND IT'S LAGGING ON MENU. SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS THAT IT RUNS WITHOUT LAGS BUT I FNG TIRED OF TRYING TO RUN IT AND HOPE THAT BLESSRNG WILL GIVE ME NOT LAGGING RUN

The game itself is really great! But technical problems make me sad :("
4392,"Achieved [spoiler]True Perfection[/spoiler] with a 160 hours save file. I never thought that planting crops, raising animals, foraging wild bounties, mining rocks, fishing and fighting slimes were this addictive.

Just 1 more day and then sleep, that 1 more day became 1 more season. The game provides endless possibilities to enjoy. The game also helps me relax after a stressful day with the brilliant OST ([spoiler]Winter Festival [/spoiler] is my favorite).

Thank you ConcernedApe for creating Stardew Valley. I enjoyed every single second with the residents and my [spoiler]in-game wife, Haley[/spoiler]."
4393,"Super cute game, really fun to play with others :D"
4394,"Overall a very fun game, and it has a lot of content to explore! If you ever need more, I suggest downloading mods, as they add a lot more to the game, too."
4395,"Its SUCH  cute game. Very very fun and you can never get bored since there is so much to do, even after completing the initial storyline of the game ^^ And you can play with friends too! :D 

10/10 game imo :3"
4396,very cute and a good game overall.
4397,"[h1]Couldn't recommend this game more for anyone looking for a Minecraft/Animal Crossing type gaming experience[/h1]

I've got 205 hours out of this game, and that's only tracked before I started playing modded. I've doubled those hours at least since then - the base game is lovely, but mods do take the game to a whole new level, both in terms of content & visuals. [b]I would especially recommend using the Nexus app ""Vortex""[/b] - this shows all your mods, where you got them from on the Nexus website & if they have any updates."
4398,good game
4399,"Great for RPG, action game lovers."
4400,nice
4401,aWOOga!
4402,It's a good cozy game
4403,"This is one of my all time favorite games! I loved Harvest Moon growing up and eventually found Rune Factory, which introduced farming with a mining/monster fighting twist. This game combines all the best elements from all those games."
4404,SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD
4405,Used to love Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing. Played tons of Minecraft in the beginning and loved Terarria. This is like a mix of all of those and way more. Timeless classic imo
4406,Calming and relaxing.
4407,dating sim
4408,"My first play-through of this game was one of the most magical, wondrous, and feel-good experiences of my life. Nothing but childhood memories of the most cherished games can compare. If I had but one wish, it would be to play Stardew Valley for the first time, again.

My one bit of advice: Don't spoil yourself for anything. Don't use the wiki. Don't google. Just farm, explore, do the quests, and make the friends. Spreadsheets and economics aren't that important. Grow some stuff. Go fishing. Just enjoy the beauty without someone else telling you what happens or how to play.

That's all. If you're here to read about its features and stuff, the 400,000+ other reviews gotcha covered.


"
4409,"Wonderful game, 10/10. I have given nearly 200 hours of my life to this game and I will probably give even more. Even if you get tired you can always put it down and come right back to it. There's also so much content here! i've played for a while and I still have yet to reach Perfection. Give it a try!"
4410,its such a great game i installed mods on it and now its even better
4411,very cool
4412,I played like 1000 hours on ps4 because I was obsessed but I got jealous cuz pc has mods so I got it on pc so I can play with mods and tbh I'm glad I bought it on pc aswell! Money well spent😎
4413,"I don't game and I don't leave reviews, but Stardew Valley is the only exception. There is something so relaxing about farming, taking care of animals, fishing, interacting with NPC and even mining! I'm so grateful that I was able to get this on my laptop. I would recommend this game to anyone as intro to computer gaming or just a distraction from life."
4414,meh
4415,It's very interesting game if u're alone & u has a lot of time to play
4416,your mind is filled with thoughts of getting this game
4417,"Honestly pretty relaxing, thats all i gotta say! If you're looking for a farming game to past time, this one offers quite a lot"
4418,your mom
4419,"Fantastic game to imagine what it would be like if you left your job as a corporate cog.

4421,super addicting and i love the multiplayer feature!

4424,surprisingly addictive
4425,fun

4444,Really fun game! Especially on those lonely nights when you're to scared to contact your friends so you need fake people to talk to :)

4458,"If you love building a farm or love relationships, then this game if for you!!"
4459,love
4460,sick innit an that
4461,"It's a neat little game, and while I don't find it that fun, It's undoubtedly very high-quality and seems like a nice game to wind down."
4462,Such a relaxing and creative game gives so many options in what to do and the best part is i can enjoy it with friends. One downside is that it isnt cross-platform but otherwise a amazing game.
4463,vary good
4464,i havent been happy in six years until now

4466,Why get married when I can fish all day and come home to polite monster roommate
4467,"good, very chill game"
4468,"Very fun, fishing is cool
"
4469,An absolute blast. The best way to chill out. It is so wholesome and I love the art and music. I have considered buying this game on Switch as well just so I can play it wherever I am.
4470,yes
4471,This is a great game I've been playing on xbox for a couple years and it is better for the most part on PC. I loved this game on day one I even bought the board game version.
4472,good
4473,5 stars. Very good.
4474,Wonderful game to play with friends!
4475,:)
4476,"Bought this game today after wanting it for a very long time. Played it for 6 hours straight. Love the concept, the art, the mechanics, the story, and the soundtrack. The only problem I've had was confusion about when I need to press the X key and when I need to left-click (which I believe are meant to be the same control, but sometimes one would work and the other would not). This is a small bug, though. and it didn't hinder very much gameplay. It really is a lovely game. It's gorgeous."
4477,Stardew is a game i will always keep coming back to
4478,yes
4479,perfect
4480,"Very good nice chill game.
"
4481,its fun
4482,Amazing Game!
4483,This game is like Terraria but with a interesting farming system and you can marry people. All the characters are interesting and have a ton of story lines. There is so much to do and I am no where near finished. So yes I recommend this game.
4484,"My go to game for when I wanna relax, chill, and not think about anything for a good 2 to 200 hours."
4485,If you're a Minecraft player I think this game is for you my friend. Pretty beginner friendly and easy to get the grasp of.
4486,.
4487,"cheaper than therapy and makes happy chemical in brain go brr
idk man something about pixel animals and plants and being able to fulfil my cottagecore lesbian dreams from the comfort of my own home
12/10 recommend"
4488,very fun game and very relaxing
4489,Super easy to lose yourself in. Having to tend to my farm lets me calm down and breathe a little.
4490,"fun
"
4491,i really like this game but i especially like sam
4492,top
4493,"good game nice farming
"
4494,"I'm not a big gamer. I like games I can play for a while, then move on to something new....then come back some time later and continue playing. Terraria, Slime Rancher, Necesse and Starbound are all games I enjoy. I would definitely put Stardew Valley on this list. The ""monster fighting"" is minimal but still fun and the art is pleasing to look at. I've played quite a bit over the time I've had this game and can say that there's always something new to explore."
4495,i like shane
4496,Well i first started playing on switch but i then became bored it was a fun game but after a while it became repetitive which i then saw mods i didnt have a labtop at the time but soon i got a job and could afford one i just started playing yesterday with some mods (I reccomend Stardew vallley Expanded) And i'm already loving this game again
4497,noice
4498,P]-\\]=]\
4499,"I have enjoyed this game, made many new saves! the grind, adventure, stories and fun is just on point.  i wish there would be dlcs to add more content or simply a stardew 2 with more animals, stories, places to explore, new minerals and uses for them. new recipes and new pets with actual use? but for anyone returning or new playing, this game is a 11/10 fun, peaceful adn always fun to start back over."
4500,shane had a dump truck of an ass.
4501,amazing and cute <3
4502,Fun chill game
4503,"i've played this game for 69 hours and finely am writing the review.

its a good game lol."
4504,slay
4505,I love it. 10/10
4506,"very cool, very nice, very chill"
4507,"Fun relaxing farming game

until you need to min-max every crop space and sprinkler system and inventory slot and end up making spread sheets and text documents of how many crops you need to place and exploiting an island ecosystem for more farm space and trying to balance npc friendships and your animals happiness to give you the most money income so you can save up millions of dollars to hopefully spend it all on a useless gold clock to 100% the game and then realise you've spent over 200 hours and don't actually have those millions of dollars because you wasted it all buying salad and bombs and sticks that teleport you places.

its still fun at that point, but isn't as relaxing."
4508,Love it. lots of fun and there are lots mods.
4509,"the game is quite hard to learn tho it becomes very enjoyable and fun, though i strongly recommend to watch a tutorial on the game before going in"
4510,"Great Game, Couldn't recommend to others more!"
4511,when i close my eyes all i see is stardew valley
4512,yes it is very good game :)

4520,the game is adorable and very chill
4521,peak game
4522,"I'm not a gamer but my daughter showed me this game and now we play together all the time. Quite fun and a bit addicting. Lovely graphics, soundtrack, and story line. The quests give you guidance but you still have the freedom to do what you want."
4523,Amazing chill farming game

4530,I had a lot of pigs. I picked up their shit. best 200 hours of my life.
4531,"A game full of secrets and mini games that add to the offense of a sandbox.
There are always patches that are removed and you can always try the game again after finishing it in a different way (even without opening a new world) so I really recommend it and if you are really distracted from the normal game there are mods so no problem."
4532,"Extremely high quality, fun game. Highly recommend"
4533,yes ;^) very nice game

4555,enjoy
4556,Been loving this game since forever! This is the only game that keeps my sanity intact while I'm in college.
4557,"hhehe,, frarm"
4558,"Sweety Honey Mega Farmer Mini Town Super Aesthetic Chil Atmosphere Amazing Interesting Ultra Cool Sound Nice Story, but i want a [b]christmas[/b] update."
4559,"Simple and lovely, Stardew Valley is a game I've come back to again and again. This is something I play across various platforms, and is just as fantastic to play stuck in bed with a cold as it is in a waiting room at a doctor's office. Using a controller does take a little getting used to, as it's not entirely intuitive - not tricky or unresponsive, just not intuitive.  I'm confident there are hundreds more hours of playtime enjoyment for me to enjoy! :)"
4560,"Epic Chill Out Game. 10/10. Just play it without watching any Guides, best experience..."
4561,"Stardew Valley is a game that I have a lot of praise for. From the characters to the variety of things to do, there's so much you can do in Pelican Town and beyond.

You start out the game primarily farming, but over time you start to fish, mine, and fight monsters to gather more resources or money. While farming is the ultimate king in making a profit, the other activities you can do in this game still have their own benefits, and each of them are enjoyable in their own ways. Mining and Combat are probably the most fun for me, as it's the most involved. Descending into the mines, steadily gaining resources with more ores found, battling monsters that get in your way, it's a fun adventure.

The characters you meet in Stardew Valley are fun to talk to as well. While some villagers such as Gil and Gunther are less commonly seen than the others, they all serve their roles in the town, and they all gift the player for their kindness and dedication. Some villagers are able to be romanced into a relationship with you, and each of them seems to fit into a ""type"" that many players may be interested in.

Lastly, one of my favorite collectathons in gaming has to be the journey to restore the community center. Each bundle is themed around a certain aspect of the game, encouraging you to explore everything Stardew Valley has to offer. Once a bundle is completed, a new part of the town is revealed to you, expanding your fun and resource-gathering opportunities. After you complete the last bundle, the town celebrates the restoration of the community center, and you effectively win over Morris and his Joja corporate occupation of Pelican Town. While this game has no true ending, if I would consider the game to have one, it would be completing the community center.

There's so much more I can say about this game. From character cutscenes to the brilliant OST, to the satisfaction of perfect crop planning. There's just too much to talk about in a ""short"" review such as this. The only thing I can criticize the game for is how quickly a day passes. I wish days were longer, as I feel like I can't sit still without wasting a bunch of time. There would never be enough time in one day to do everything, but if only you could do more. Aside from that one minor issue, everything else about the game is great. I hope I can enjoy this game for many more years, however quickly they go by."
4562,I vibe with it :)
4563,Its great

4568,"Well, what can I say? I always loved Harvest Moon-esque games. Farming games are fun, ok. I especially fell in love with Rune Factory as well. You could fight there. And guess what? You can also fight in Stardew Valley, so heck yeah. Great game. Great music. Much content. But don't listen to what a random review says. Go play it yourself and have fun. <3"

4580,"so in stardew valley i played as bob ross doing relaxing farming stuff, funny, fuck you clint.
nice game must play 5/5"
4581,"A simple premise and gameplay can go a long way when executed well enough.

The only fault I can pick are the sometimes mediocre characters and dialogue.
That's not to say some of them aren't entirely lovable though! They're just a little lacking - but you have to expect that from an indie title. Here's hoping the dev learnt a lot for improvement in their next game.

Final note: 
Not a thorough or really useful review from me this time, but one necessary if only to help keep the game at ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" here on Steam.
Give the game a shot if you somehow haven't by now. Worst case, it's not for you but you still support an indie developer."
4582,Happy fun times :)
4583,This game is soooo good it will make you happy and like the characters soooo much

4623,poggers
4624,"This game is so awesome. I've played the mobile version at length and finally decided to install it on my PC and man I am so glad I did! It keeps me entertained for hours. I also love that it is such a relaxing game; there's really nothing stressful about it at all. I used to think the fishing aspect of the game was hard, but then I got a training rod and now that's easy too!"
4625,fun and good thanks

4633,LOVE
4634,its cool
4635,Very fun game. I would say its a grindy game without making it feel grindy. With 337 hours in this game you can tell it is very easy to lose track of time.

4644,cool
4645,God i love farming 😠
4646,"It's an addicting game. I am so glad I gave it a second chance.
To be honest, I struggled in the beginning, was so confused on what to do, so I watched a few youtube videos, as well as read some posts on how to get started and it helped a lot.
I got it as a gift from a friend."
4647,"I like this game. It's very well made, especially at the price. You can tell it is a labor of love for Concerned Ape. It is a bit complicated but the game is set up to help you and go at a pace you feel comfortable at. There is also a lot of help online. 
It's annoying that I can do full completionist because I am really bad at the bar game, but I think I've reached the natural end of the base game. It was all I played for a stretch of time. It is mod supported, but I haven't delved into that. I am very excited for Haunted Choco."
4648,"Extremely Chill and Relaxing. The story and the goals made me addicted, and it is just overall a great game. I would totally recommend it. 5 Stars."

4650,"Who are you talking to right now? Who is it that you think you see? Do you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I tell you, you wouldn’t believe it. Do you know what happens if I suddenly decide to selling artisan goods? A business big enough it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly-up. Gone. It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don’t know who you’re talking to so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Abigail. I am the danger. A guy opens his fridge and drinks his starfruit wine, and you think that of me?

4658,
4659,i like
4660,"I have purchased this game 7 times. In order, Switch, Vita, Switch (for a friend), GoG, Switch (for another friend), Steam, and Xbox.  I've 100% completed it on Switch, Vita, and GoG and have probably 1200 hours in it conservatively.
I love this game. It's not perfect but for every niggling complaint there are 10 things to praise.  Fishing sucks until you get it and then it's so much fun you'll lose days to it. Sometimes if feels like you can't get the artifact you need but when you finally do it's so satisfying it's worth every moment.
Somehow the developer has imbued his simple (in relation to other games) characters with so much personality you can't help but pick a favorite. Separate sprites for every plant, character, animal, etc...the love is felt in every step your character takes.
And then you start modding it.
Just buy it, you know what it is so you probably know whether you'll enjoy it or not."

4680,very nice
4681,"A very relaxing game where you can explore a small town and the outlying area while farming, fishing, mining, and managing livestock. The music for this game is amazing and forging bonds with the other townsfolk is a nice extra if you are more of the social type."
4682,"There are a couple of factors I utilize when determining the quality and fun of any game. Stardew hits a lot of them. 
Replayability is a major one, and Stardew gives you a lot of options for replaying with different experiences. While the cut scenes and the day to day gameplay will remain the same, you can play again using a different look, name, and type of farm. You can choose a different spouse or romanceable character to date. You can choose to have kids or not, and to uprade your farmhouse or not. You can choose to rebuild the Community Center or to work for Joja. And you can focus on different professions and aspects of farming. So the level of involvement in the storyline, with the people, and the community is very customizable, and completely up to you. 
Other factors that matter to me, and probably to many other gamers, include a good story, pleasing graphics, music that is - at the very least - not annoying, likeable characters, and an easy-to-use UI. Again, I think Stardew Valley does a good job at meeting all of these aspects. The controls are pretty easy, even for a non-gamer, and the graphics are really cute and in some cases detailed and sort of funny. The story of the community, and of each individual character is full of depth and as you complete quests and continue making friends you will learn more and more about this little world and the people in it. Not comparable to storylines you'd find in a Square Enix game, or something like The Last of Us, of course - but considering it's an Indie Game with cutesy, pixelated graphics - the characters in the game have a decent amount of depth and there's a lot going on to discover. 
All in all, Stardew Valley is a game I would recommend for gamers and non-gamers alike, and I think most would find it enjoyable for different reasons. You can play it again and again, and still not discover all of it secrets. 
Well done, Concerned Ape. I look forward to your next game :0)"

I hesitated to buy this game for 2 months. After buying, this has been worth every penny and more. If you're skeptical of buying this, just do it. If you don't like it, add me on steam and I'll make you like it."

4721,"I put off getting this for a long time as I doubted I would enjoy it. Played it once and was addicted. It has many different things to do and can keep you busy for hours. Always fun as you can fight monsters, farm, and build up your farm how you choose. I enjoy it alot. Mods can add hundreds of hours of game play and also speed everything up without cheating so I like that alot too. I would recommend this for anyone."

4813,"This is some of the best $15 I've ever spent in my life. Stardew Valley is my favorite game of all time, and with almost 800 hrs of gameplay I'm still not even close to being tired of it! It's so much more than just a farming sim, with awesome customization options, a slew of different events and activities, a bomb af soundtrack, and complex npcs who you get to form close relationships with. I really can't believe that this game was only made by one person. I can't wait for his next one!"

4820,Very calming game to play when you wanna relax and play.
4821,wish it wasnt so energy constrained but great game
4822,"10/10 Recommend the game!!
The best way to play Stardew Valley is in co-op / multiplayer mode. It makes the game progress way faster,more bearable and enjoyable than playing solo, obviously.
It is a cute pixelated game in which you basically own a farm from your grandfather so you can build it up the way you like and create your new farmer life as you desire to.
Lovely soundtrack, good storyline, adorable game design, nice characters.

I personally love it a lot and I don't regret having it. Everyone that likes casual-relaxing, cute-indie games ,you have to get Stardew Valley ! =)"
4823,gooo(d)
4824,I like this game it is cute. Would recommend.
4825,"Fantastic game with seemingly endless content once you add mods. Tips for enjoying this game to the max:
[olist]
[*] Do a play through and reach at least year three and/or complete the Community Center
[*] Go to Nexusmods and download Stardrop (a mod manager made specifically for this game) and set it up to work with NexusMods.
[*] Browse and download mods that expand the game and fix any things you found annoying or tedious in the vanilla game. Some recommendations: Stardew Valley Expanded, Ridgeside Village, Better Chests, Better Ranching. Make sure to download all dependencies
[*] Replay the game in a way that YOU customized to your liking. You can create an AMAZING experience this way.
[/olist]"
4826,Its a fun farming and social game :)
4827,:)
4828,its really fun and I will definitly play it again
4829,"This game is amazing It's like harvest moon, Animal Crossing combined but with fighting battles as well. Fishing in Animal Crossing has always been one of my favorite things to do on Animal Crossing games and Stardew Valley makes caught fish become more than just a number but a experience with many fish that have to be caught after certain conditions are met. Finding weapons are really fun to do as well you can find a weapon that's dropped by an enemy that can become your most powerful weapon."
4830,potatoes = rich
4831,Fun and more open than you would think
4832,good ig
4833,Great game
4834,"Best farming game out there. If you think the game has too little content, or gets repetitive, don''t stop playing. There's always a little something new behind every corner. New areas to visit, explore, new people to meet, and that's avoiding spoiling all the amazing stuff. 

All in all, if you want a relaxing farming experience that always ends up giving more, then this game is dope!"
4835,decent
4836,nice game
4837,"honestly relaxing the music he art style

4838,i love this game too much
4839,Very Wholesome game. Gives off happy vibes.

4842,gay game be lesiabns
4843,"I didn't really get into it that much but I recognize its quality and that overall its a good game, just not for me. Its fun w/ friends though!"
4844,"A rather relaxing and peaceful game, good for just chilling out on a rainy day"
4845,"Probably one of my favorite games I've ever played. I definitely recommend playing if you're looking for a cozy farming sim.

10/10"
4846,Stays true to old harvest moon elements while expanding on some new ideas. Great game for solo or people who are looking for something new to play with friends. Hopefully we will get more updates to this wonderful game!
4847,yes

4862,5/5
4863,yes
4864,"I am in love with this game. It takes a lot for a game to grab my attention long enough, but I have spent hours doing the same farming-type actions and did not get bored ONCE! I've played through a good majority of the love interests (Sebastian + Shane, you own my heart) and the story line is well thought out and excellently paced. My only issue with the NPC's is that after you have gotten married, the personality in your love interest dies out and it becomes very cookie cutter to the other marriage choices. I am not too mad at it however, as the dating is the most exciting aspect. I would recommend this game to anyone who has a heart, and the capacity to love."
4865,"fun

4867,I only play this game for Haley
4868,It’s very fun I’d highly recommend it

4871,nice.
4872,"this game is fun but after u start min maxing for no reason at all its still fun but after alot of time min maxing it starts to get kinda boring but its a realy good game like 10/10 for new players and like 7/10 after u play for a while and after u get perfection and u dont have a lot to do in the game its like 5/10

4880,"Go to Nexus Mods, Download Vortex, go to Stardew Valley collections and pick one ya like.
Good Game"
4881,"I've heard only good things about the game, and when I bought it, it had surpassed my expectations by a mile! As someone who does pixel art quite a lot, I was blown away by the look of the game. The music, storyline, gameplay, graphics, and everything inbetween is amazing. Highly Recommend."

4884,GG
4885,this game is literally so addicting i adore it sooo much
4886,yes.
4887,"The amount of nights i have spent playing this game really go to show how perfect it is. You can spend hundreds of real life hours grinding and having a good time along you cows and chickens. I recommend this game to anyone as it has something for everyone. From farming red cabbages to killing flying skull ghosts, this game never fails to deliver an amazing experience."
4888,"Uh... I only spent a little bit of time in this game, but from what I can tell it's fun.

You can talk to people (everyone is interesting in some way).
You can save an alcoholic.
You can marry anyone who's single.
You can grow crops.
You can fish.
You can mine.
You can kill monsters.
You can search trash cans with a hobo.
You can take care of animals.
You can raise blue chickens that you bought from an alcoholic.
You can make fun of the forever alone guy.
You can give gems to the local hippy girl.
You can watch a war hero with PTSD treat his family badly

Well, that's about it. I only tried to do a few things here and there. I didn't waste too much time playing it. I'm not sure though. What year is it?"

4938,I have 253.8 hours on record as in current in writing this there are so many ways to play this game and I will play it for money wise this is a game about where you invest in seeds then make a entire farm filled with seeds and your entire stardew days with money you will begin a pattern and once you get sprinklers your days become more easier. Until you die and lose all of your items inside of a cave due to a lot of swarming enemies.
4939,"It is pretty darn good. Grandpa haunts me in real life though that part was too realistic for my liking.

4975,Absolute beauty of game it takes your mind captive and you forget about true reality. The interactions and relationships in this game make you forget about your miserable life in the real world it fills all the empty spaces within yourself with a fake life!. At some point i wish for Stardew to become my real life but i cant seem to make that a reality. why cant i be happy...

5001,"So I've been playing this game for a while. TLDR, I love it so much but I wish Shane's room showed his character development.

I'm currently at 549.1 hours.
This has been my comfort game, not only do I play it on PC I also play it on my switch and my PS4. I've never been so invested in a game that seems so simple and this was before I discovered mods.

I'm going to be honest here, despite how much I love this game I feel very sad that my first run of it three or four years nearly ruined it for me. I was playing on my switch, decided to romance Shane and completely fell in love with his character and story... but his room irked me. The second I saw the beer cans and dirty floor all I could think was ""where's the character development that I just witnessed and worked hard to get to??"" I put my switch down and wondered if maybe I could clean it up but no. Not on my switch but if I had mods on my laptop... but I didn't like modding games at the time. I still like playing it vanilla, I only have mods for it on my laptop when I am just looking for something new.

Sadly being who I am I couldn't handle the mess. I've dealt with alcoholic's in my life, its not fun. It's not pretty and seeing that, despite him changing, he was still displayed in that way made me feel sick to my stomach and I stopped romancing Shane from then on. My 100+ hour farm that I had made on my switch felt as if all my progress was for nothing.

I think Shane deserves so much better. I want to romance him more but... I can't.

I love this game, I still play it on everything whenever I have some time. I even spend time playing it on stream, with friends, or with my partner. If I could change anything it would be that one detail.

I'm not saying there aren't other faults but of the 500+ hours I've only ever been upset by that... and the fact that we can't discover more about Abby, her mother and the wizard."

Its a wholesome, cute, and amazing game, and I definitely recommend it to anyone even if they do not particularly play games."

I'm really glad I finally gave this game a try and hope others spend some time exploring the aesthetically pleasing landscape, delving into the story, and creating their own home in Stardew Valley."

There is so much you can do; apart from seeding and harvesting various crops you can establish relationships to all the townsfolk, grind ore collecting, fishing, improve the aesthetics of your farm, discover secrets corners of the valley and so much more.
Modding opportunities are vast, You can do even more with that, adding more content or mechanics to the game.
I can wholeheartedly recommend the game, have fun with it, 10/10."

5088,has no business being a grindy game
5089,"To be honest, when you start playing it can be a little difficult. Though if you can persevere and really get yourself immersed in the story, and the farming aspect... You can feel and realize how much there is to this game, and just how calming it is to play it."
5090,Awesome Game
5091,"This game is one of my personal faves, i´ve played 90 hours on this steam acc and 300 on another. I find the game quite relaxing, fun and you can do a ton of stuff. You have a farm, so farming is obviously one thing you can do but there are other things too, like talking to villagers and becoming friends (or more), there´s mining, quests, etc. I think that if you like farming games, cozy games or something of the sort, you´ll love this one!"
5092,"The game is outstanding. It's so fun and so relaxing after a long day at work. I can come home, turn off my brain and just take care of my crops, my animals, i can even go fishing. There is so much to do in the game and then some. The modding community is amazing at what they do as well and they make mods that make that game even more enjoyable. There are some days where i just want to play with all of my mods but then there are times where i want to play just the base game, just because it's just THAT good. If you have been waiting for a sale or been on the fence about getting this game. I urge you. get this game as soon as you can. The base price for the game is so worth it, you will definitely get your moneys worth i promise. ALSO THERE IS CO OP!! Play with friends and go do some goofy shenanigans!"
5093,"you might have trouble just figuring out what to do with your time in the beginning but once your grounded in the game, its a wonderful experience"
5094,this game has some emotional damage
5095,basically free therapy
5096,i think i'm addicted

5100,gerçek hayattan daha iyi oynayın agalar
5101,"Apparently word has gotten around that this is a very good game, yet some people seem to have problems enjoying it. So, here is my manual to how to enjoy this game:

- Set small, short-term goals.
Don't go looking for a final goal. Plan for today and maybe tomorrow. ""I'm fishing for eel today"", ""I'm planting the new crops today"", ""Let's explore the southern part of the map"", ""It's Haley's birthday so I'm giving her a present and then I will chop some wood, the forest is just next to her house"".

- Don't get stressed out.
Your in-game day has limited time, but your game has not. Every single event that you might miss will repeat. A certain special event can be re-triggered easily any number of times if you didn't get it perfectly. No need to suffer from FOMO (""fear of missing out"").
Your energy is hardly sufficient in the beginning to get anything done, but your max energy will grow with certain archievements and raising your skills will make you use less energy for each action. Don't hesitate to eat some veggies or fish for extra energy instead of selling them to get some more stuff done if you have much daytime left.

- Explore.
The game is not about getting rich. You can grind yourself to millions of gold without difficulty by just farming (although it will take forever), but the real game is exploring what's out there waiting for you. Wherever you go, there's stuff to discover. The mines don't just hold monsters an minerals. NPCs change their dialogues the more you interact with them. After the community center is done, some people might have special tasks for you. There are more areas that you gradually unlock, more NPCs you discover, more shops that hold interesting items.

- Try, fail, succeed, whatever.
There is a very extensive wiki and if you REALLY want to get everything perfectly on the first try, you can use it. But there is no penalty for failing and no reward for succeeding on first try. Do stuff on your own and it will feel much more satisfying.
You can still look things up if something starts to frustrate you, like when and where to catch certain fish, or if you don't understand a cryptic message that is supposed to be the final clue to something.

Some quality of life tips:

- Finish the boiler room as soon as possible (you will know what I mean when you encounter it).
Makes getting around town so much more comfortable.

- Upgrade your watering can the day before it rains.
The weather forecast announces rain for tomorrow? Great! After watering your crops today, immediately turn it in for the upgrade. You can retrieve it after two days and water your crops just in time.

- Get quality sprinklers asap.
Less time and energy used for watering and more time and energy for whatever else you want to do. Sprinklers are a big game changer.

Some ""why didn't you tell me earlier???"" stuff:

- Don't donate ""that egg"". Don't eat it either.
What else can you do with it?

- Don't sell or eat your last strawberry.
You only can get the seeds on one occasion per year.

- On a similar note: Keep one of everything.
Someone might randomly request it.

- Remember the shop is closed on Wednesdays.
So buy seeds in advance if you need to plant on Wednesdays.

(very minor non-story spoiler)
- Your skill choices [spoiler]can be changed later, so for your first playthrough just take what sounds good. You need to discover a certain area first though[/spoiler].

5105,Absolutely love this game. It is easily the best game I've ever played. It's so relaxing and there's no pressure to play a certain way as there are so many different ways to play this game. The value for money is outmatched and I would recommend this to everyone.

Puedes sembrar, criar animales (que nunca mueren), hacer conservas, ir a la mina, conocer a gente del pueblo, pescar, o simplemente pasar los días como te dé la gana.

5181,"Simply love this game, very addicting"
5182,"I am a 40 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started Stardew V. and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching black women twerk on Tiktok. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, chose a server, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

5193,10/10 realism cats flop over a lot i can confirm that this is very accurate to real life
5194,"This game is such a rewarding game. I have severe anxiety and depression and somehow this game just helps me calm myself down. It's relaxing and ConcernedApe is one of the best developers. I'm super excited for his next game, but this one will always stick with me. Maybe by the time the next game comes out, I will have beat Journey of the Prairie King. One can only hope. I truly do love this game and if you want something to help you relax and feel safe, this is it. It is such an amazing and rewarding game."
5195,this game cures my depression and gives me hope in life

5231,"Played this game so much I can't relax anymore and I'm constantly thinking about the drop rates, or the most efficient crop to grind etc. Love this game."
5232,"The only reason i'm giving this review as a negative is this game is really overrated for real
my friends judging me because of not purchasing ""Terraria"" and ""Stardew"" and tbh they are good games
but not really my kind yeah if you want to chill you can play stardew and if you really like farming games this game might be for you and no this game ain't addicting it's just another pixelated game. 6/10"
5233,fun game
5234,Awesome game!!! Worth the time :) I do not regret the 104.9 hours I have played so far
5235,Best psychological horror game I have ever played.

5304,Cute

5325,thia game is amazing for the price. ive spent hundreds of hours mostly on modded pc and switch. i love this fucking game
5326,Stardew Valley
5327,"I like it, Picasso."
5328,"The classic and the best. Since Stardew came out and really set itself up as the peak of the genre, a lot of other developers have tried to mimic its recipe. I've found many that do a good job mimicking the formula and coming up with a new interesting setting/characters, but no one has ever really improved upon it. Stardew is the top of its field and with a dedicated group of modders, I can't see it every truly fading away. 

Play it your way! Whether you like to build a vegetable or flower empire, become the greatest rancher or all time, or wrest the mines back from the monsters that control it, you'll find something for you in this amazing game."
5329,"hehe, dinosaur mayo..."
5330,nice

Love it so much"
5344,it is worth the wait and money this game is fun and realistc
5345,i would die for sebby
5346,"I was never a big ""gamer"" when I was younger, but then I discovered cozy gaming. I find myself coming back to these kinds of games after long days, bad days, or just when I'm bored. This is one of the few games I will sit down and open just to play alone, on my solo farm."
5347,Great and good
5348,"Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold."
5349,its okay i guess
5350,Lewis
5351,Very good
5352,I have close to no hours on this for PC but i played a ton of it on switch. great game for relaxing with friends or for when your parents are fighting lol
5353,"My favorite game! Love love love!
Everything is so good, every sound, all the cute lil animals, just wonderful."
5354,i love starew valley. also shane is fun (smiles endearingly)
5355,"perfection
"
5356,good
5357,:)
5358,"Both in singleplayer and multiplayer, this game always manages to entertain you."
5359,:-)
5360,Farming is Fun.
5361,"  It's good, I do feel to a certain extent it kinda needs mods, at the very least a cheat menu just to up the farmer's speed and to shorten some of the timers on things like furnaces or the cheese press. Really good otherwise though."
5362,"You get many bitches if you play this game, I recommend if you wanna be cool Giga Chad (;"
5363,very fun. would recommend.
5364,"good game
i havent seen anyone since i started playing"
5365,This game is really fun! It's a good game if you like farm games. I don't know what else to say except it's amazing! :)
5366,i have given my life to this game and it's still not enough
5367,"Good game, 10/10, good with one hand playing xbox controls while using my pc. B)"
5368,"
Damn this game is addictive"
5369,Game Good!
5370,cheeky
5371,i fed a guy eggs until he fell madly in love and we got married great game
5372,im addicted
5373,i have about 100 hrs on switch in addition to the hours i have on here. Game Good.
5374,"the greatest game ive ever played, there is only ONE thing that i hate about this game and that is that you cannot slide down the slide. that is all i hate, otherwise i would recommend this game to anyone, you can marry a gem eating goth girl, you can get a dinosaur hat, you can add mods that give you a tractor, and you can farm potatoes. this is legit anything you could ever want in a farming simulator."
5375,"One of the best games ive ever played. One of even fewer ive given 10/10. I love and adore it, if this is a genre you like give it a try and please support it. I cannot wait for Mr. Barone's next game."
5376,Love this game so much!! Highly recommend to anyone.
5377,The most peace you'll ever have these days
5378,Love the concept
5379,iyi
5380,gud farmer
5381,A good game to get friends involved with in multiplayer but single player can be fun too. Lots of mods to spice things up after playing a long time be it visual only or ones that add new goals like building a tractor or adding new locations and characters. I especially recommend a canon friendly dialogue mod to make talking to the towns folk less repetitive after playing a while.
5382,I love playing this cute game <3
5383,This is a good game if you just want to chill and not deal with any bs
5384,It's fun and calming and I like to play on rainy days cause it adds to the comfort ambiance. That's it.
5385,"This game is incredibly fun but also keeps that aspect of peace when playing it. From the idea of inheriting an old farm to the great personalities and designs of the characters, this game for me is overall a 10/10"
5386,this game is good and very good I like it
5387,nommonoommmnommnommomomnomonomom
5388,I like the fishing. Its fun
5389,"Such a lovely game, so much replayability. Full of coziness and good vibes. One of my favorite game ever ever ever."
5390,"Very fun, a lot of fun mechanics. Only complaint is Junimo Kart. Can't beat it for the life of me..."
5391,Farm Thumbs up
5392,"Near perfect vanilla experience, gets even better with mods. One of the best communities of players and modders. Near endless playability."
5393,I like this game a lot! Its very cute calming and fun especially playing with friends.
5394,I saw a youtuber playing this about 6 years ago and wanted to play it ever since
5395,good
5396,">Start with 15 parsnips

>Finish with a industrial wine factory
Definitely in my top 10 favorite games"
5397,Very fun game
5398,"Nice, peaceful, and relaxing way to pass the time."
5399,Super fun relaxing game. It's a bit hard to control movements for absolute beginners of pc gaming and the time moves kinda fast so you might waste some time when you are first starting but you will get used to the controls. I love it still.
5400,"a very chill game, with a relaxing feel and tone"
5401,marnie bad af
5402,Volim paradajz♡
5403,"A very zen game with a ton of fun and odd features and tasks.  It's a grinding game where you farm, forage, mine, and fish your way to prosperity and maybe even love."
5404,Getting a boyfriend irl is not possible for me. This is a good second choice
5405,meow
5406,"Only a couple hours in but it is running much better than I expected. For reference my terrible 4GB of RAM laptop is only stuttering when I have something running in the background, On the other hand it starts vibrating when I run any 3D like ROBLOX or Albion online so really good. 

The art is cute, the fishing is a little hard at first but I think it get better when you level up? The farming is relaxing but still sweat breaking when I'm low on energy or its 1:30Am. Haven't been mining too much so can't say anything other than watch out for the crab. Characters are lovely and their sprites look great, currently gifting Linus as many times as can <3 

Its a relaxing farming game with  great characters and a great setup."
5407,"10/10
if ur reading this we should play stardew"
5408,I named my cat Soup. I love this game!!!
5409,Wholesome gaming experience
5410,"its good
"
5411,"Stardew Valley is one of those feel good, easy, casual games that you can pick up and put down at your own pace. The music is calming, the graphics are nice to look at, and the easy going at your pace story line is easy to follow."
5412,Nice game

5415,"9.5/10 (-0,5 because I have played it pretty much 24/7 for two weeks straight, which has caused a massive build up of dishes on my desk and a lot of laundry that needs to be put away.)"
5416,"i love this game, im about to start playing this game more when im bored in class so i can make a cute farm. 10/10"

5421,"""This game is worthy to play"""
5422,This game is the best game to ever ever.
5423,i didn't know i  would get addicted. Its just a fun relaxing farming game with so many side quests and side stories to keep you entertained. I don't feel rushed and can take my time with this game.
5424,"i got this game on sale a couple years ago, 3 years later, this is one of my favorite games of all time. I have this on almost all of my devices. This game is such an amazing way to pass the time, whether it be by collecting achievements, decorating the town, making friends with the villagers. There's something in this game for everyone. I would recommend this to almost anyone."
5425,Super duper cool
5426,it was good best game
5427,"Amazing game tbh I got it 3 days ago and alr have 15 hours on it, I'm obsessed. I also had it on switch before this and have around the same amount on there. The only thing I don't like is that there's no crossplay, so if you're looking to play with somebody on switch, don't get it on pc."
5428,absolutely love this game
5429,best laidback game

5452,"Very relaxing and chill game, I really enjoy playing it"
5453,nice
5454,A chill game to play
5455,"A fantastic game to chill out to

5456,Bloo Chickies
5457,YES
5458,"I love how game tricks you. 
When you think ""i got everythin' there is nothing to do"" game just smashes you with hidden content

i have over 400 hours on all systems combined and have probably gotten around 80 percent perfection

5469,It's the perfect game.
5470,"The most pleasant game ive ever played.
From music to gameplay, its calming and fun loop just keeps me hooked and happy"
5471,This game is so addictive- there are lots of things to do so you won't get bored. The more I play I keep finding new ways you can customize your farm and even other areas of the town. There is a kind of loose story to follow which is nice but you mostly just play at your own pace and do what you want. Really relaxing and fun!
5472,we chillin

5474,A lot of depth to such a simple game. addictive and always a joy to replay
5475,"dope af, relaxing, great soundtrack. i love the art style, i love the community, its really vibrant. i started playing this the night i bought it and before i knew it 7 hours were gone. so cool. i hope they make a sequel or something, but i can tell im gonna be playing this game for a long time to come. my friend said they got like 500 hours in this game."
5476,i also have a dog named ranger
5477,"Great game for a relaxing time, for sure."
5478,"I have to change my review for this game.

It's way too boring, repetitive and frustrating for children.  I played the game in EA and it was much more fun back then. 

The mining in the game is very boring and repetitive.

The combat in the game is early 1990s rubbish and will just frustrate children.

Once you reach a certain stage in the game it just becomes boring. I ended up with tons of everything including money and I'm only at winter season in year 2.

They extended the game by adding a island and it took me 5 days to open it up due to some sort of bug. To discover it is just more of the same except with a few different goodies that aren't worth chasing.

Much better games out there for children and adults."
5479,Very chill long game
5480,get rich
5481,is ok game
5482,The art style and story lines are so cute. Music is absolutely stunning too. I'd recommend this game to anyone

5500,One of my favorite games! A good game to play when you just want to relax.
5501,This game is wonderful! The creator works extremely hard on the game and the community centered around the game is amazing! I would definitely recommend!
5502,It is a really good game to just kind of play when you are bored or if you just like farming type games
5503,Literally the best
5504,"rlly cool game! very fun to do all the different activities, holidays, and to see how the characters develope as you get to know them better!"
5505,"I married Penny, and didn't realize what a trashy life she had with Pam. The poor girl had nightmares until she moved in.

10/10 would farm again."
5506,Stardew valley is a game a good game a great game even
5507,i love stardew valley because its a chill multiplayer game that you can play with friends as well as alone. i like skill building aspect aswell its pretty cool. Theres also alot of love-able characters to romance.
5508,"As a farming sims fans such as HM/SoS/RF, I AM ADDICTED TO THIS GAMEEE-------
it's very story rich, there are a lot of things you could choose to be/do, and damn do i enjoyed a lot of time here. I LOVE EVERY SINGLE FEATURE IN THIS GAME??? ITS A PERFECT GAME-------

the only downside for me is... the bachelors, imo most of them are very generic (aka most of the boyes looks emo???? why). I still like their backstory/personality, it's just the emo look one on everyone (except harvey and elliot) that kinda makes me feel a bit down.

the bachelorettes are OK, they're very cute, pretty, and wholesome! :0 kinda have the same generic problem as the boys (most of the gurls are just plain cute/calm/nice), but their looks/aesthetic are kinda different so it's not as meh as the bachelors.

overall, great game 10/10, it feels like i can play this forever without getting bored!"
5509,SO GUD LA
5510,good game
5511,Its a game that is playable :)
5512,"the game is just like this :::
$LCID missed 2Q badly, delivering just 679 vehicles and posting net revs of $97M vs $147M E. For FY’22, LCID now forecasting just 6-7K production vs 12-14K previous guidance.  As

 says, production is hard.

5513,very relaxing game for when u wanna chill after a long day

5520,"its fun
"
5521,I like this game very much
5522,good
5523,This is one of the best farming simulation games I have ever played. I love it so much I have bought 3 copies of it. I recommend this game to anyone who likes Harvest Moon games.
5524,One of the best games of this genre. Everyone should play through it at least once if you enjoy cozy games.
5525,A very fun and relaxing farming simulator. I'd recommend it if you like causal games to sink some time into.
5526,"it's beyond addictive, easy to neglect your real needs to see that ur farm flourishes, but totally worth it"

5539,It's a very fun game that I can play at night to relax
5540,"stardew valley is one of those games where you probably have heard of already. and it is exactly as lovely as you have heard. if you have not heard of stardew, its a simple but deep farming sim with beautiful pixel graphics and a whole town of people to befriend, or fall in love with if you are so inclined. if you played harvest moon you know most of what the core of the game is, but it also has some lite combat stuff too."
5541,farmville but awesome
5542,Relaxing
5543,"relaxing and simple (played the mobile version and the fishing on pc is way easier and less glitchier, but do miss the auto attack function though)."
5544,tought me how to proffesionaly throw rocks @ whamen and now im married 10/10
5545,"Amazing game 10/10.  Play at your own pace. Explore, make relationships, improve the town, design your farm and start a family.  Adults and kids alike will enjoy it.  It can even be a teaching tool for money and time management! Once you finish a farm to your liking, there are a million ways to expand the game with mods designed by fans.  There's a whole community of people playing this and helping each other out.  It's a deep and enjoyable experience."
5546,"It feels like I'm on a farm in a Valley
"
5547,
5548,"Stardew Valley is one of the best games I have ever played and I never intended on even playing it in the first place. Most of the games I end up playing tend to be super high action and with intense gameplay, just because that is what keeps me engaged for the most part. So when I first started playing this game, I didn't think I would adore it as much as I do. The farming sim can be pretty fun and addicting to constantly try and make your farm more and more profitable (and better looking) but what I loved the most was the relationships and story told in the game. Talking to the villagers in Stardew Valley is what kept me around and wanting to learn more about the town itself and its inhabitants. You feel like someone living alongside with these people and the writing is just amazing. The time mechanic that makes you take each day to the fullest is a lot of fun in trying to optimize in making money, growing relationships, and building your farm and personal skills. I find myself stressed a lot of the time and this game is an INCREDIBLE destresser and I would recommend it 100% to almost anyone. There is a ton to do in Stardew Valley, take it at your own pace and immerse yourself in this cozy, little town! (Also the mod community is awesome and there are some great mods that enhance the game in every way)"
5549,ya!
5550,Super relaxing yet just challenging enough to keep you on your toes.
5551,"This game is absolutely amazing! I highly suggest playing it, solo or with friends."
5552,"1st day 16.5 hrs. Next day, gifted it to my brother lmao. yeh it's good dawg. really really calming. not too hard. not too easy. gives just the right amount of dopamine shots to my brain."
5553,"I have bought this game on every platform I have that I can get it on. This game is one of the best games I have ever played, even though it falls into a game category I'd never play in any other circumstance."
5554,"I have this game on Steam, Switch, and mobile and it is worth every penny. The different skills you can level help guarantee there's something in this game to appeal to everyone. The characters are charming, the story isn't overbearing, and there is plenty left to do after you ""beat"" the storyline. Highly recommend!"
5555,Pog
5556,"I say the word 'beans' a lot for no apparent reason, and this game gives me a reason to continue :)"
5557,Farm
5558,fun
5559,"you will sink your whole life into this. the stardew valley wiki is a great resource if you get lost, but it is entirely possible to get by without looking at the wiki once. mods are easy to use and download and are useful if you've gotten to end-game content and are getting bored. super fun with friends unless they play prairie king for six hours and pass out at 2 am, losing half your shared income..."
5560,Good game in general
5561,"Absolutely amazing game- I got it on sale after seeing multiple videos on what the game was like. This game is super cute, friendly, and provides co-op for me and my other friends who have the game as well!!"

5583,Not bad I like it
5584,"penny good, pierre bad"
5585,This game is not relaxing like people say it is. Its not really stressful either though. Its like being given responsibilities to do that you know you can complete with just a little bit of effort. I like it.
5586,Yes Boss! More parsnips right away Boss!

And it continues to surprise me with its level of depth and detail. Oh how I long to be magical farmer unconcerned with responsibility!! Side note: the soundtrack is phenomenal."
5618,"One of the best games in the Steam store. Super relaxing to play, its heartwarming, exciting, and rewarding. This game helped me get through a seriously bad spot in my life, and it will always hold a special place in my heart. You can take it as seriously as you want, you can be a casual player taking it easy, or you can go hard and try to maximize every day's potential; either way is fun! Great game even for people who don't play many games, especially with multiplayer. Would highly recommend 11/10!"

5639,good game
5640,is good for sad
5641,I’ve only finished one year in game and it’s already my favorite game of all time. It’s just the perfect game to shut your mind off and escape reality for a couple hours.
5642,"I grew a buncha pumpkins the other day and a couple of them turned into A GIANT FREAKING PUMPKIN. I WAS LIKE ""HOLY COW! LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT PUMPKIN!"" So I turned to my wife Leah, yeah... Leah there's no need to seduce any of the other harlots this game has to offer, and I said ""Look at the size of this PUMPKIN!"" She didn't say anything, were not on good terms since I gave her two of the wrong gifts this week and shes been increasingly sour towards me. I might consider getting a divorce with Leah; although, i'm hesitant as we have not signed a prenup and i'm saving for Gold clock. If she takes half my money it will take SEASONS for me to bottle enough wine and coffee to get where i'm trying to be. Bottom line I cant in good faith give this game a good review till we get quality legal representation. Don't waste your time growing your pumpkins when the ladies in this game will break your heart and empty your wallet.

5684,"In many ways this game is amazing. Between the story, the gameplay, replayability, music, and all the other little things are just simply phenomenal. I have spent literal YEARS playing this game and still having a blast. That being said, the game at its very core is still a farming sim. So for those not keen to this genre it might not be worth. But as someone who was intrigued by the cute art style and was not too into farm sims, it was a great purchase that I do not regret whatsoever <3"
5685,Just a fun cozy game with tons of replay value and a great community

5695,"it sure is video game!

it's fun farming sim. only thing is that i wish sometimes that there were more interactions with the NPCs, but i totally get that that's not the focus. besides, anything that you feel like is lacking can be fixed with some mods. (no fr mods are great and they're easy to install for this game.)"

 I would 100% recommend to anyone like me, who is a newbie at games. 
 The game is really fun and its not your usual farming sim.
 Never thought that i would enjoy and find so much comfort in fishing (but here we are) 
 Really recommend the multiplayer option! Played it with my friend and it was so much fun.
Probably my favorite game like EVER"
5734,fun
5735,listen stop looking at the reviews and buy this game its one of the most calm games i have ever played every single part of this game will make you feel relaxed so please give this a try you can refund it if you dont like it

5750,"I am not a cozy gamer. I am a cool action gamer.
I like this game though. The level of excitement I get when I see my crops are almost grown. The rush of dopamine when I hear the sound of harvesting a crop or picking up an item. This is a masterpiece game.
This game has made me a cozy gamer."

5757,"I just turn off my brain to play this game, I love it so much. Farming AND you can date the npc's? I listen to the soundtrack when studying."

5759,it ruined my life (affectionately)
5760,ys
5761,nice test...
5762,super fun!! so many things to do!
5763,"I couldn't deal with how slow everything was because I had just played Spiritfarer for quite some time and my quota for patient games was basically at its limit, but once I downloaded some mods it was very fun because it seemed a lot more customized. I use mods in... [i]moderation[/i]... but it's mostly things like movement speed and location warping because [spoiler]you don't get the materials to warp until like a whiiile later, and even then it's a device you need to craft and where you teleport and from where is still very much limited[/spoiler]. I love the lore and graphics though, they're really nice. [b]I wish you could change your farm name and farm type[/b] though, because I kinda regret both and I've gone too far to just create a new save 💀 And lastly, I think it's tough to get through Stardew all on your own; like, I keep having to refer to the Wiki a lot, or the mod I have that gives me information about whatever is under my cursor.

Yeah that's all for now slayyy"
5764,i am now addicted. absolute 10/10 game.
5765,"The game is good, however there are two things that keep it from being amazing for me:

1) Movespeed - base character's speed is very slow. Everyone is sprinting at all times. I'm sorry, but if you walking - you're a psycho. If you aren't making or buying coffee later in the game - you're also a psycho. Ideally, this is how I see the solution: walking speed should be just a little higher, base speed on horse should be your running speed and horse's speed should be much higher than that. There are no other way to increase your speed except ""+1 speed"" consumables, which is also adding to the problem. (Oops, forgot about flooring that gives +0.00000000001 speed, how could I...)

2) Combat system is one of the worst in videogames ever. First place undoubtebly goes to Dont Starve, but Stardew Valley can take the 2nd place. Yes, you can fix that with mods, but I don't like that kind of stance. I wish dev did something with it. Why not make it so your character attacks in the direction of your mouse? This is such an easy fix and it doesnt ruin your game."
5766,"this game singlehandedly cured me of my mental illness but in an ironic turn of events, made me more mentally ill seeing as i play for 8+ hours every single day. my most favorite game ever."

5780,Best game i've played very enticing would reccomend to all of my friends great for multiplayer just overall great game 5/5
5781,no sex scene when asked to make baby
5782,farm fun. dying not.
5783,EPIC
5784,"This game is a masterpiece, from its music to the pixel art, the calming experiece while playing this game is unbelievable and it all combines into the best sandbox game ever."
5785,genuinely just an amazing game. and the fact that it's a passion project is lovely. cannot recommend enough. very relaxing as well.
5786,slay
5787,"One of, if not the best farming games around."
5788,"Very fun game, its got lots of potential to be played for endless hours"
5789,"Apparently I have the most hours on this game in my entire library. Wow. Where did the time go?
The story is interesting, diverges into your generic mining, fishing, farming, and people-ing but keeps you hooked. There's different ways to play this game - be a hermit who only communicates with the town via the shipping box, be a sleep-deficient dungeoneer, be the town's most wanted playboy/girl, or live a life tending to nothing but animals - it's all fun.
All the secrets and hints throughout are a gem to find too, kudos to ConcernedApe and the entire wholesome community on providing this. The final update was refreshing and, while one could finish the entire thing very quickly if they're used to the game mechanics, it still leaves something to be remembered.
This is also a really cool game to build a 'life' with your SO or just play with friends. 

9.5/10, a must-have in every Steam library."
5790,"It no Farmville, but it good game."
5791,Fun
5792,"Cute, immersive game. The storyline is really engaging. It's has the perfect balance of mellow to action."
5793,.
5794,perfect for gay people <3
5795,I love it!
5796,I love being bisexual
5797,"A phenomenal game that I have to uninstall in order to progress in my actual life. It's a drug that I, and many others, can get addicted to.

10/10, stop playing it."
5798,Who doesn't love Stardew Valley
5799,I love it so much.
5800,probably the best cozy game ever
5801,"best of the best bro, just play it its worth it.

5808,"After i got Shane's eight heart cut-scene i bolted to Marnie's to cycle through the chickens until i had four little Blue chickens, not many people know you can own blue chickens so i thought i'd add it to my review. I have currently played for 65 hours and if you are thinking of getting the game i recommend you do i love taking care of my virtual farm and especially when the seasons are over and i've to do all the math to figure out how many seeds i need somehow still ending up with not the right amount."

5823,"Mods are very lackluster, wasnt expecting minecraft level mods but gah damn its dry"
5824,"fun game I spent hours and hours on it making my lil farm. I Like that it has different things to keep me interested. I can focus on farming, socializing, or mining!"
5825,i love this game
5826,I devote my sanity to this game
5827,A very relaxing experience. So many different ways to play. Many hours of gameplay for such a low price. I would 100% recommend getting this game.
5828,valla iyi benim gelecek planlari bunlar
5829,I don't know what else I can say that will convince you to buy this game. Just look at how many positive reviews there are.
5830,Such a great game! I could and have spent hours tending to my farm and talking to the villagers. And getting a group of friends together to play on a world makes the game so much more fun.
5831,Good:)
5832,good add more cats
5833,my absolute new favorite game
5834,I LOVE THIS GAME
5835,im literally playing for elliot.
5836,very long game but fun
5837,"Great game, reminds me my old grandma's house"
5838,i love fishing :))
5839,"A wonderfully written game with near infinite replay-ability. Even if you get bored of the base game, Stardew is super easy to mod and the modding community is massive. Stardew is by far one of the best rpgs i have played."
5840,"calm game play, with a wonderful Art style and great music to really help you feel at home. I would always recommend this to help relax if you've had a long day at work."
5841,for those who tired of work days
5842,Nice relaxing game
5843,"I enjoy playing the game because it gives me something to do as a distraction when I need a break. I can just sit back with a cup of tea and some cookies and let myself become immersed in the game. I have recommended this game to other people, and highly recommend this game to anyone who needs a long peaceful game to play. Also! if you are not an avid gamer (like myself) I highly suggest some ice packs and small breaks in between for your wrist. We don't want any pain while playing a peaceful game.
 I quite enjoy the farming aspect of the game, and I enjoy being able to make friends with the villagers. 
The music is nice to listen to, however, it can get a bit annoying after a while, so I would suggest turning the music down if you have a problem with repetitive music. I prefer just the sounds of walking and the sounds of nature more than the music. BUT the winter music is great, I love the winter music and the music in the mines when you get to a certain level. 
I don't really have any complaints that can't be fixed myself in the settings or by adjusting my way of playing or sitting.  So all around a very fun game!"
5844,"I LOVE Harvest Moon esk games and this one def holds up (if not, is better) than the classics. Abi is best wife <3"
5845,Fazenda
5846,"good game
"
5847,"This game is truly worth your time. Genuinely reinforces mindfulness, time management, and productivity in my opinion."
5848,Very Addictive
5849,"Ah yes, the farming game where one relaxes. You start up a farm, which at first does... very badly. You have bare tools, you have little resources, and only a tiny bit of pocket change. But, you slowly start getting through. The first month will be a breeze before you know it, and you'll quickly figure easy ways to make cash, either by focusing on your fishing skills or mining your way to the richest ores. The game is hard at first, money wise, but starts becoming less nuanced as you progress. I fell in love with the game the instant my friends and I started up a co-op world. Now we play every night. (While I have the furry mod active and marry everyone's favorite girl-dragon Abigail. Why does she say quartz is delicious?)"
5850,"i bought this in 2016, finally launched it last month, am happy boy"
5851,AMAZING GAME ! FEELS LIKE A MIX OUT OF MINECRAFT AND TERRARIA . ITS SO ADORABLE
5852,it reduces the amount of mental breakdowns for me 10/10
5853,Gud game
5854,Expandable and enjoyable for hours
5855,"Fun little farming game, building relationships with the towns folk and exploring the mines is always a good time!"
5856,"Stardew Valley is so cool. There is tons of things to unlock. Tips: After you get rid of joja mart, the old building will be struck by lightning... then you will find the missing bundle to complete it, you will find 5 rare items. The Mayor's purple shorts are in Marie's room."
5857,"This game took my soul. Oh yeah play Stardew Valley. A cute little farming simulator. The event that occurred next nobody could have predicted. An event of great magnitude and catastrophic cost. I have dedicated the past month to achieving all 40 achievements this game throws at you. It starts out easy. Oh yeah get 50,000 gold. Oh nice, cook 25 recipes. However what they don't tell you is the majority of the achievements are only gained at the end. And I don't use the word end lightly. It took me 3 in game years to achieve this feat. Yes it can be done in two, but at this point, 2 years? 3 years? 10 years? it all feels the same. The monotonous tasks of filling casks with fruit to make wine. Grinding for the mythic prismatic shards. It takes so long. And none of these tasks are boring, or un-fun. The entire time I was thrilled. But I lost a part of myself somewhere along the journey. Something that I will never get back. Maybe it was when I accidentally spent all my qi gems on 250 qi seasoning, or maybe it was the time I mis-clicked a mega bomb after finishing designing a part of my farm. Wherever, whenever I lost that part of myself doesn't matter. Its gone for good. All we can do now is look to the future. Keep our heads up and keep on marching. Maybe one day I may wake up and it will all feel like a bad dream. And only then will I be able to rejoin society as a normal person once more. Someone not scarred by the wound only Stardew Valley could inflict. Maybe I will feel okay again. Maybe

10/10 Would play again."
5858,You could easily sink hundreds of hours into this game. One of the only not boring farming sims I have played.
5859,"I can only recommend this game!
It has a charming art-style, great soundtrack and fun, relaxing and easy-to-learn gameplay.

Maintaining and decorating your farm is fun in itself and being able to upgrade your gear and grow your farm is very rewarding. You are later required to take up some new activities (mining, fishing, monster-hunting etc.) if you want to make progress with the town or in NPC relationships, though the game really lets you do things at your own pace, making even progression feel pretty relaxing. The inclusion of festivals, random character events and character birthdays really helps keeping track of the passing time and seasons (ignoring the clock/date/weekday in the UI :)).
If you are a completionist, you might enjoy this game for its many quests and achievements, though some might be more challenging than others.

Playing with friends may be fun, but what I struggled with when playing with friends was the progression of time. If you try to share a farm you can only really progress when everyone plays at the same time, so it might be better suited for people who want to play with their family or S/Os, when it's easier to keep track of when both players can play, otherwise the person who doesn't have time might miss out on whole seasons!

Lastly, my favourite pet is the grey cat. The animals in this game are very cute."
5860,yessir
5861,I absolutely love this game. It's my comfort game. I grew up playing harvest moon and absolutely adore this game! 10/10 would recommend!
5862,"Amazing game, honestly amazing. I was blown away by how good this game is. i saw it for awhile and just meh.. but i bought it and its super good. Honestly, get it and play to see for yourself you wont regret it."
5863,I really liked this game. I had loads of fun and I installed a mod and it's even better! I definitely recommend this game.
5864,aesome  camge
5865,"The chickens and ducks can have my blood, sweat and tears, wtf why are they so cute, hey kinda have cat vibes but yes good game
"
5866,buy this game as soon as you can. its truly amazing and even better with mods.
5867,"This game is AMAZING! I recommend it to pretty much anyone who enjoys free-reigned RPG adventures that include combat, exploring, adventure, farming, and creativity! It's so addicting and was actually only made by one person, Eric Barone (Otherwise known as ConcernedApe) he is a very nice person and is actually coming out with another game based off of Stardew Valley called The Haunted Chocolateir. Contrary to the game being rated E10+ I recommend it to anyone over the age of 7, as it isn't completely inappropriate. Enjoy!"
5868,Very gud
5869,i love staredew vally
5870,I love this game. If you want a chill & calm game this is it.
5871,"really fun for co-op, kinda difficult and long when you're solo, but a calming game fr fr. even more fun when someone gifted the game to you LOL"
5872,Amazing
5873,nah but srsly this game is so chill
5874,good
5875,bro this game makes me aroused
5876,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.
"
5877,Fun but don't try to min max too hard unless you are up for a challenge. Going at your own pace through your first playthrough or so will rent a much more engaging and enjoyable experience once your skill at the game improves.
5878,"Please help, the only thing ive done for the past week is play this game. I made a freaking spreadsheet with the gross profits, expenses, and profits. i cant stop playing"

5910,"yes

5911,"It's a really immersive game and just take me into the world. Every time I start a new save or whatever, it's really fun to figure out different ways to work through the game and playthrough and they do keep adding new contents and mods also works well with this game and give it even more space to explore and do storytelling so it's just amazing and well worth the money"
5912,"Fun little farming sim, a bunch of NPCs to talk to, and you can get a dog! (or a cat if you prefer)"

5914,i used to play this game so much about a year ago and then i got a computer and found out i can actually play it with my friends i was so happy when i found this out this game is such a good game its kinda grindy thats why i like it
5915,chicen
5916,"Things i learned in 315 hours:
- Goth gamergirl eats gemstones when hungry
- Farming is actually really fun
- Inflation doesn't exist in the valley
- The minigames are harder than the basegame
- Horses can wear hats
- Hops are really profitable
- Manual labour is the bane of my existence
- Krobus is best boy
- George is honestly a nice man 
- Shane starts as a total twat but can be really nice
- Pierre is the worst villain ever
- Lewis is the worst mayor ever
- Eric Barone is the biggest of chads

All jokes and facts aside this is one of my favorite games and i would gladly spend another 100 hours in the game. Get it while on sale if you want to but in my opinion its worth every penny even when at full price."
5917,ur mom
5918,"One of the first games i purchased on steam, had a lot of fun with mods for this game. Multiplayer is fun but you need a good friend to have a good time and from what i have seen servers are not... good... at all
Overall the game is perfect. Stop attacking the ONLY developer for not releasing 1.5 for mobile, you have to appreciate that he is doing free updates for a one time purchase game."
5919,"10/10

I will sell myself on Craigslist for 5 Iridium Bars."
5920,You can play at your own pace and work towards various goals in whatever order you want. It's the PERFECT game for any couple to play together.

5946,"It started out normal. I was so clueless. I just thought this was going to be some farming game but no. Soon I realized this was life or death. If my farm doesn't look the best and isn't optimized in the best possible way I am a sad excuse of a man. I put in blood, sweat, and tears into this game. Stardew is my life and I am proud of that fact. Stardew is there when it all seems to be going downhill. Stardew is that friend you always need in your life because you know you can count on them no matter what the situation might be. If you are considering getting yourself involved into Stardew, please do. Best game ever. You will NOT regret it whatsoever. Just please use the damn wiki.

5993,"girl bye this is the best game ever. i am SOOOO addicted. i have been sitting down on my seat for like 40+ hours now with minor breaks and well i started sleeping again, but my butt is NUMB... and i dont ever care PLSSSSSSSSSSS. its such a calming and cute game. in a few weeks i had 100 hours already sdfyhfiudLKJ. the only thing is, i wish it was crossplay smh but its such a good game nonetheless. i hope concernedape adds more to this game too < 3"
5994,I love the graphics and music. It's a nice relaxing game to play and I love that I can play alone or with friends and still have the same amount of fun.
5995,its a relaxing game
5996,Really enjoy how easy it is to get into this game. I enjoy getting to make my own farm and making connections with the other villagers. Plus it's so easy to mod and make the experience truly one-of-a-kind! I absolutely recommend playing this game!!
5997,goes crazy fr
5998,I really like it! It's similar to harvest moon but more suited for older gamers.
5999,Farm

somebody made the same review but it's okay, Amazing game, I'm addicted, it has so much stuff to do and a lot of places to explore, It's so relaxing to play and in the same time there are places and scenarios that make you feel thrilled and excited, I'm not really into games like this, but this game made me change my mind, first review of a game I ever did."
6016,Good farm game where you farm.
6017,sebastian is so hot
6018,"Fun farming sim with a lot of depth in the characters, lore to explore and debate, multiple methods of play.  Very relaxing!"
6019,uwu
6020,its so fun
6021,"Its better if you play with other people in my experience. The characters are cute, and when gaining hearts with the villagers, its fun to see how they interact with you when going along through the seasons/years. Nice to find little Easter eggs too in the game."
6022,
6023,literally the best game ever made
6024,"Fun mind numbing game. It's more fun to play with other people, but also good if you're a single gamer.  I will always enjoy this game after a long day of work and I just need a break from everything."
6025,"Do you want to ruin real life friendships, lose your partners and get fired from your job? This is the game for you. If you get in to this, then you won't stop. Not when your gran dies, not when your baby takes their first step, not even when you sleep - this game invades your dreams.

Highly addictive, wholesome, fun with friends and on your own. Also, if wholesome fun isn't your jam, then try the arcade games within Stardew, they'll make you hate yourself in no time."
6026,big pp gaming
6027,"yes
"
6028,One of my top Favorite games that can be ran on any PC and stay addicting for years to come. Cant wait for the sequel ;) Thank you for watching. Signing off! Kira from channel 16 News.

6038,"Charming farming and crafting game---somehow super relaxing and engaging at the same time, with tons of great content that can keep you playing."
6039,"A really nice experience, with smooth gameplay and a lovely story to develop to your liking."
6040,"Delightfully over 500 time stamps played over on the Xbox box. I am proud to admit I have absolutely 0 regret about this, unlike my 200 hours spent on Ark. I must urge anyone to play this game as it is the perfect game."
6041,ah
6042,It is amazing
6043,"My favorite game! Charming story, great pacing and game play, incredibly dedicated creator. Easy to mod and a great community for anyone!"
6044,"The versatality of this game is really what I feel brings new players in; you can play it for a calm farming experience, a game to make as much money as possible, a combat game, a dating sim, a little side project or life dedication. Truly one of the most addictive, peaceful, relaxing and fun games i've ever played."
6045,If a video game could be Serotonin it would be this one
6046,I absolutely LOVE this game. There are hours upon hours of playing time and you can have so many different types of farms. It's wonderful.
6047,i don't need a wife because i'm married to the grind
6048,its fun
6049,"i dont know what im doing other than fishing. fun game, fun fishing"

6055,"Good game, very gay"
6056,"great game! totally recommend
"
6057,Absoloutley amazing. Its a great game and I have become completely obsessed. I keep wanting to play another game but I just keep coming back. Its great and it made a great challenge to draw my smash main with a stardew background. It has a lot of aspects of real life and is super enjoyable
6058,"0/10 not enough carrots, I wasted hundreds of hours on this game and only just realized that"
6059,Its kinda like life if life was a video game
6060,simple the best.
6061,Great game
6062,love it
6063,in the 6 hours of playing this i have already installed 50+ mods into the game. i will not stop.
6064,Now i can tell my friends that i have a girlfriend. 10/10
6065,"Fantastic farming sim with charming, simplistic, graphics. I've spent entirely too much time just running around on my farm enjoying the scenery that I still haven't even completed the game, 90hrs in. 11/10, couldn't recommend higher"
6066,"YES
"
6067,it slays
6068,"This game is extremely enjoyable! The only qualms I really and truly have with it are hardly even an issue overall, but more so a preference, the time moves a little too quickly. I have a hard time keeping up with it, but that's alright. I've had fun in every single aspect of the game, farming, mining, fishing, interacting with villagers, everything. it's incredibly laid back, everything is set at apace you set for yourself, and is EXTREMELY mod friendly. And I haven't officially beaten the game, yet. I could not recommend this game enough, if you enjoy a structured, but lax game style. Genuinely worth every single cent, despite the fact I received it as a gift. I will definitely be buying Concerned Ape's new game once it does come out. High hopes for that one, and any further updates on this game!!"
6069,cvm
6070,the best game I have ever played!! I can play it for hours without even notice

6072,Farming Simulator but with snarky villagers
6073,"Very very fun! WAY more than just a ""farming game"" with cute character options. :D"
6074,:)
6075,cant sex george :(
6076,I have been playing this for 3 years now on my nintendo switch. And it is very good. The farming is very fun and pretty much every aspect of the game is well made and is difficult to master. There is a lot of replay value with different ways to play the game.
6077,"So many diverse characters, superficially a small cute farming game but there is so much lore in this small map. So much to do if you trigger the right things. You can see your progress over time and it is so refreshing to play."
6078,"""You know that new guy?""
""Yea?""
""He's just been standing at the lake fishing for 12 hours""
""Has he caught anything?""
""Yea, he's caught at least 30 fish""
""Where do they go???""
""I was wondering the same thing!"""
6079,its pretty cool lol
6080,Very good at losing time
6081,bery gooodo fanks
6082,Classic
6083,Who could say something bad about this game?
6084,Great game....would play for hours and never get bored.
6085,"Play with your girl, play with your boy.

Play."
6086,I put the mayors underwear in the luau soup. 10/10 game
6087,"One of the best games i have ever played, i own it 7 different ways. totally worth it. i likely have wellover 700 hours across all my plays. For 15$ or less, probably the best game out that you can buy for value/content. At the very least its worth a try even if you dont like farming games"
6088,Best chill relaxing grinding game
6089,"According to all known laws

there is no way a bee

Its wings are too small to get

6090,pretty gud idk
6091,A fun farm/life simulator that deserves all of its praise.
6092,It's a game that you can sit down and genuinely play for hours on end and lose track of time. I first got it due to my friend and honestly it's become one of my favourite games so far. I could not recommend this game enough.
6093,"The vanilla is so much fun and also modded as well. Concerned ape does great work, cant wait to play the next one!"
6094,blueberries
6095,Amazing game
6096,I like the game
6097,i marreid my bf
6098,Bought it three times and i regret nothing
6099,"Bom jogo pra relaxar depois de um longo dia estressante. 

Até você chegar no final, em que você tenta min/max pra conseguir otimizar suas 20 horas no dia, aí você acaba se estressando ainda mais.

10/10 vale a pena completar 100%"
6100,"Absolutely LOVED this game!! Usually not my style of game, as I love MOABs but something about sitting down with coffee in the morning and tending to my farm and petting my chickens without actually having to worry about forgeting to feed real ones, is so therapeutic."
6101,"BEST GAME EVER!  SO COMPLEX, Like FF3 meets Sims meets Minecraft.... the best of each in one game!"
6102,A Lovely Farming Game <3
6103,"I've clocked up an obscene amount of hours in this game, both on Steam and Nintendo Switch. 10/10 I recommend this chilled farming simulator. Lots of mods available over at Nexus, so game play and aesthetics are customisable.

I hate writing reviews, but you should absolutely get and play Stardew Valley. Good, wholesome, fun."
6104,Tree is fun to cut
6105,peaceful
6106,Me like game
6107,its cool ig
6108,Harvest moon but you can mine and fish

"
6112,"Gosh, where I do I even begin? Retro graphics, go at your own pace farming, exciting combat in mining, romancing the Bachelors and Bachelorettes, building, fishing, I could go on forever! This is in my top 5 favorite games of all time, for sure."
6113,goog game
6114,you can get a girlfriend
6115,"Very fun, chill game. Great for 5 minutes or 5 hours. Retro masterpiece."
6116,addicting
6117,haha funny brrr farming brrrr marrying to sebastian brrrr haha poopy
6118,"Super fun game, play with friends and your beloved one together is nice"
6119,Literally spend way too much time playing this game but its soooo good
6120,A chill pill.
6121,10/10. very nice.
6122,"An unexpectedly engaging and wholesome reprieve from the usual experiences we're so used to. Great music, charming visuals and captivating, albeit simple gameplay."
6123,good
6124,"[h1]If I have to choose between this game and Minecraft,
I will definitely choose Minecraft.[/h1]

[h1] But this game also has its own charm. [/h1]
It is a game with various things to enjoy, low price, good manipulation, and a lot of fun and fun.
Like real life, I farm, harvest, earn money every day
Watch TV and learn the recipe.
Cooking
Peaceful background music can also be more immersed in the game.
The seemingly endless quests make the game more realistic.
It is also good to be able to decide the future on your own.
It's amazing that the story can flow strangely.

[h1]Sometimes I get angry when I play this game. [/h1]
My character's energy is running out too quickly.
Even if you use a little water spray, you have to go back to sleep.
The mine is also too small.
I don't want to play this game because there are so many inconveniences.
I started this game thinking about farming freely all day long
A number of restrictive parts make me lose interest

[h1]I think there are people like me who are not interested[/h1]
But when I think about why I'm not interested in this game, I think it's because I usually enjoy FPS and other genres of games

[h1]It's definitely a well-made game.
But my conclusion is that I wasn't very interested in this game[/h1]"

6140,"Stardew Valley brings the nostalgia of Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing. You play at your own pace and there are so many side quests and hidden secrets throughout the play-through. With over 100 hours invested, I still haven't explored everything this game has in store. Looking forward to future releases by ConcernedApe. Highly recommended for a relaxing time sink."

6197,"Stardew Valley is such a simple but complex game at the same time, depending on how you like to play it. There are so many opportunities for players to whatever they like, from farming, fishing, mining, exploring, foraging, decorating your house and farm and completing quests for the npc's in the village. There is never nothing to do! To make it even better, players can play multiplayer which means they can do all those things with friends with an option to share or not share their money. This game is far better than just a simple farming game and I highly recommend playing it!"
6198,yes.
6199,Please help. I have a terrible addicgtion to this game. I nver leave my room. My family members hate me. I starve and am dehydrated severely. DO NOT GET THIS GAME WITHOUT KNOWING THE CONSEQUENCES
6200,"Nice, chill experience. Clean UI, easy controls. Perfect game to relax and decompress at the end of the day"
6201,Best game to ever exist
6202,"Game nice, makes brain go brrrrr"
6203,i played this game a ton when a first got it. it's been years now but i have about 100 more hours on it now so. good game
6204,Super fun and mindless with so much to do
6205,bery fun farming
6206,"most relaxing and addicting game ive played in a while, highly recommend for those that are lonely"
6207,This game has ought to be one of the best games/farming games i have ever played. I do recommend.
6208,"This game is tons of fun, there is so much more to do  than I thought. I love the farming, but i really enjoy diving into the mines in search of shinies. There's something for everyone and being able to play with friends on the same farm is great!"
6209,i would recommend this game to my friends cos its a good relaxing game
6210,"This game is exceptional. Even though I have only just bought the game and only have around 10 hours on it and there is so much to say about it already. But in general I have just been hooked to this game, it almost never gets boring no matter what you do and is a delightful experience to play with friends, there is rightfully lots of grinding involved but when it comes to gathering wood or mining copper for a while I still yet find the game fun and one of the best parts of a grind is when you finally earn your reward after a hard day of work. It feels relaxing when you wake up and go outside to water your growing crops then maybe go to the chicken coop and let the chickens out while you collect their eggs, then you and all your buddy's can group up at someones house and make fried eggs, and from there all of you walk into town and begin a day long adventure. This game is so amazing and i have only explained one path you can take when you wake up, once your out of bed the day has endless possibilities, so if you like to relax and chill or just hang out with friends and generally have a good time you should think about buying this game (:"
6211,how did u make me fall in love with a fucking asshole

6213,"it really annoys me that if i got far enough in stardew valley, i’d not be able to be polyamorous or marry multiple villagers, or get them pregnant, without having to install a mod

what standards or world was this game made in, seriously

thankfully this mod exists, https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10021

so i can be a polyamorous trans girl in-game too.

BUT, given stardew valley lacks steam workshop, i’d have to remember to install the mod and all its dependencies on all my machines, every time i reinstall the OS and thus game, or risk breaking my save file.

so basically, i’m not playing stardew valley until these arbitrary restrictions are lifted in the actual game

6214,Very relaxing to play and fun with friends.
6215,"Amazing game, 10/10"
6216,"It is a lovely game! Who knew such an amazing game can be made by one person. True talent! I used to play it on my sisters laptop but now I have my own and i get to play with my friends all the time, its a great relaxing game that doesn't make you go insane over getting things done, you can just take your time on everything, and there is always something to do. I recommend this if you want to relax and just have a fun time, calming your nerves."

6219,"This is a fun game, though it can get annoying. If you've never played it before, or seen it played, check it out on YouTube. My entire family has this game, as we can play together. the co-op features are well balanced, but the start of each game is very grindy until around day 20, and then it just gets easier until winter. I would seriously recommend this game to anyone who likes farming in an 8-bit style. Could this game use some work? Yes. Is it getting that work done? Also yes. This is by far not my favorite game, but it's also not my least favorite. I haven't ever completed the game, but by day 19, you can get iridium star fish consistently if you get the real life skill to react. There are 29 NPC's with dozens of quest lines to do for each."
6220,Harvest Moon 2.0... one of the best farm sim out there. i recommend playing co-op with a mate. also please nerf fishing that sh*t is OP ty

If you keep those in mind, the game is fun and chill."
6241,Such a peaceful game to play to end my day
6242,I don't play a lot of games but I really love how laid back this game is and that I can play it in the way I want.
6243,its fun
6244,"One of the best games I've ever played, I grew up playing harvest moon and this game is almost a better version of those classic farming sims. I completely recommend it."

6252,"This game is a wonderfully relaxing and fun  experience. As someone who enjoys games with some repitition, but also the freedom to do what you want, Id highly reccommend this game. Great for turning your brain off."
6253,I liked this game a lot and I spent a lot of time going around having random little interactions with the villagers
6254,its a good game
6255,"This game has been an absolute blast to play, I've enjoyed every second of playing it. To anyone who might be interested in casual type games, I would be wholeheartedly recommending this game to them."
6256,Can make children into doves 10/10
6257,"Genuinely one of the most charming games I've played, the love poured into this game really shows in my opinion. There's so much to do in this game, and if you ever run out of things in vanilla, mods are fully supported by the developer and there are TONS of them! Sebastian is also really cute so the game gets a 10/10 for that"
6258,"I'm afraid that i can't open the game, if i open it i'd get addicted and play it non-stop. This game is too good!"
6259,its super fun and it makes you feel really responsible
6260,Yes
6261,"Great music scores.   It fundamentally changed Farm sim Games.  If you somehow have not played this game, you should."
6262,If you want chill and easy game this one is for you.
6263,yes the best game ever
6264,VERY CUTE VERY WHOLESOME MUCH FUN SUCH WOW
6265,"Almost nothing is explained, from how to manage inventory to growing crops to even turning in quests, gotta figure it out or find the right reddit post. Every action, task or quest, every upgrade, every sale of an item is made as annoying as possible between everything being so spread out and things only happening at certain times of day. EVERYTHING takes energy and it doesn't come back easily unless you go to bed for the day, essentially wasting said day. Between the graphics and the gameplay it truly feels like an 80's game, and not in a good way."
6266,"Stardew Valley has so much to offer, for fans of old school Harvest Moon this game is a must have."
6267,"My buddy and his wife were like ""Play this game, it is legit therapeutic."" THEY WERE RIGHT. Great game to help you relax and think about the simpler things in life, in my opinion."
6268,This game has tons things to choose from. Its a great game for rpg.
6269,less farming more homosexuality
6270,Super fun modding it and playing it on its own ! I got it on nintendo before computer but its fun on both!

6283,This game is very peaceful and calming. My wife showed me Stardew Valley and has been playing it on X-Box one and Nintendo Switch for three years.  I love the 8-bit animation and the free rein of exploring this game on the time you can spend in it.  Have fun :)

6296,"It's a very relaxing and fun game to play, and it makes you lose track of time. It's even better with mods, which I highly recommend Stardew Valley Expanded. The only thing I don't like about this game is that the developer has not updated the game on other platforms so that it can be crossplay from PC to console/mobile device. It can only be PC to PC, and Xbox to Xbox and stuff like that."

6299,"Stardew Valley is a game that you can play casually and completely seriously. It's not dark souls but the game isn't easy. The phrase wide as an ocean deep as a puddle is the falsest saying you could come up with in the context of this game. It has amazing depth, something you'd find coming from AAA devs before the collapse of good game design and its made by one man, Concerned Ape."
6300,"This game is and always be one of my go back to games. No matter how much time i spend away from it, I ALWAYS come back. There is always new things I come across with every game play over the years. I have this on 3 platforms and do not regret a single purchase. Thank you."
6301,"I love this game, it is better to play with a fun person. If you love a fun story line while helping a town and having a farm then I would say get this game. You will thank you later. XD"
6302,"Very addicted, fun and marvelous.
It doesn't let you have difficult time to climb up for success life. Earning everything in here very easy, you can choose whatever lifestyle you like, as a farmer, a miner, a fisherman, or artisan product, etc. Playing Multiplayer is a best idea if you wanted to get quick on earning money. Only the time is limited, you can't pass one day without sleep, it would be safer in home, or else you might pass out and getting charge from medical team lol. Also it wasn't difficult to please everyone in the town, I'm pretty surprised some people i rarely talk, they begin to be my best friend (or maybe because the quest i did for them haha) 

If you were planning to buy this, i guarantee you absolutely won't disappointed with this game. I tend to tell my friend this game kind of Minecraft + Harvest Moon. Anyway thanks for this realistic + fantasy game Eric!"
6303,farming
6304,"It's a nice change from Animal Crossing. Here I don't have the anxiety of missing out on anything since the game time only passes when you play it's soo much less stressful for me. I like it.
Have a good day."

6307,"Graphics:
Absolutely beautiful. Pleasing to the eye and brings a sense of calm.

Audio: 
10/10, would make you fall asleep and wake up completely refreshed [and excited for the world].

Lore:
Some lore. Enough to make you attached to the characters/town but not too much where you're left confused. 

Grind Level:
Hahahahahahahahahahaha.... 

Notes:
-can run on a potato laptop
-customization feature
-romance options
-there is some combat (not too difficult and it's not in your face

Final thoughts:
This game has helped me pull through some dark times. I would just jump onto the game whenever my mental health was becoming too much and it seriously helped me calm down and made me laugh or smile. It even made me excited to wake up the next day and just live. [I may or may not have also started gardening because of this game too lol]

Warning: you might become obsessed with this game"
6308,awesome cozy game
6309,"This game is definitely my favorite game on Steam, and it is very similar to my all time favorite game, Harvest Moon. I really like the layout and I can spend hours upon hours playing it. I enjoy being able to play co-op with my husband."

6318,TOO ADDICTING
6319,"The game appears that it could be a very fun and engaging Harvest Moon clone/improvement. However my experience has been plagued by constant stuttering, and freezing whenever I try to play. The PC version has been well documented to have this problem. With the game having been available for this long, and still have this issue, I wouldn't expect it to ever be fixed at this point. Maybe the game is playable on console, or 4k gaming PCs, but otherwise I would sadly say pass this on up. I regret that, as I was looking forward to playing this."

6341,"good
"
6342,This game be hella fun
6343,"This is is really great for relaxing and chilling with your friends or starting a new game solo. 

Stardew Valley has great music, very relaxing, plenty of things to be doing as the days flow on. The characters are engaging and well written, the graphics are really nice and well put together. It also comes with customisation which is always a welcome feature as it gives you a variety of options to change your avatar to your liking.

Stardew Valley is no means a perfect game. Some areas of the game can get quite repetitive a little too quickly. The game-play itself is slow paced to which I don't mind too much. The combat feels a little bit lacking but again I don't mind this at all

All in all I do highly recommend this game if you are feeling stressed out or just want to get away from life for a while. 

Stardew Valley is a 8.5 out of 10 for me."
6344,What an incredible amount of content and  fun for only 15 bucks. One of my favorite games of all time. I have over 100 hours on the Switch and bought it again on steam to mod it. I can't recommend it enough.

6354,"I only just started playing this game, and although i am late to the party I just want to say: first time I played this game I played for 5 hours straight. This isn't like a certain moba game in which you experience only suffering even on the wins, not, not at all... This game is a wonderful, laid back game and the fact that it was developed by one person, to me, as a software engineer  in formation, that's very pog champ. Great to play it with your crush also bc you can give them cute items like tulips or dumpster diving bread. The lore behin this game is also really priceless. One thi that bugs me a little bit is that I don't think this game is 100% beginner friendly, although it is very very easy to play. I only say this because there are aspects to this game that you mostly find out by looking into it online or if you have friends that can show you some secret doors/easter eggs. Nonetheless I have only opened this game like 3-4 times and I currently have 16h in it so I think that very much speaks for itself."
6355,"Played for like 2 minutes, I like wheat a little more now."
6356,Amazing

6360,Fish
6361,If you want to play this you should read up on the events and quests before they happen so you can participate. For the most part this is a fun game but it doesn't really explain anything to you and gives you quests and events that you can't participate in at all unless you already know about them before they happen. For example (I'll keep it vague so no spoilers) there's an event early on in the game where you have to have a certain friendship level with at least one person otherwise you just stand on the side and do nothing for the entire event.

6372,good game
6373,"Really good, was not expecting this amount of lore in what I assumed was a simple farming game. Would recommend, keeps me hooked, I absolutely love this game. Maybe even a new favorite of mine"
6374,"seriously one of my favorite games at the moment, ive had esex with every npc so far"
6375,Bought this on an impulse since it was on sales the other day. 48 hours game play later it turned out to be one of the best game I've ever played.
6376,"I am personally not an avid gamer but i have gotten it both for PC and Switch and i have played hundreds of hours. i was big into Minecraft and Diablo 3 but this has far surpassed my enjoyment for either games. if you line Terraria or Harvest moon, even Minecraft i say give this little indie game a chance."
6377,"Has great characters, good pacing and progression. But most of you knew that already because this has becomes the new farming sim standard. 

Multiplayer seems to speed all of the progression up, which can be fun. However, it's also not the way to play through the first time since time does not stop for anything. You lose the ability to enjoy cut scenes because they feel painfully slow as hours tick by in game. It's honestly one of the main drawbacks I have about Stardew. I wish they made some options for controlling time because it had been a while since I played solo, and I can't enjoy the world, and instead it feels more like a grind."
6378,"its fun
"
6379,great and fun game especially with mods
6380,Yes
6381,"BEST FISHING SIMULATOR. You can also farm and stuff, pretty relaxing. There is no pressure, just don't run out of energy or you'll pass out and get brought back to your house. The nice individuals that wonderfully take you back home may tip themselves out of your wallet LOL"

6405,"This game has always been one of the most relaxing and chill games around. It has so much replay ability and is such a blast to play with friends. There is multiple farms to keep the beginning of the game interesting and fresh for people who want to start again with an added challenge. I think Stardew Valley is suited to every type of player, whether they play games all time or are just starting. I highly recommend this game to everyone interested in something with tons of variety and tons of fun and relaxing content to spend hundreds of hours on."
6406,"I love this game SO MUCH!!!!!! The story is amazing. The gameplay is fantastic. Super replayable, excellent customization and you can really play however you want to play. Mods are a super fun way to spice it up once you've played it a ton. Highly recommend this game to every type of player, there is something for everybody."

And the creator of this game (one singular guy) is absolutely wonderful, too. He cares a lot about his game and the people who play it. 10/10"

6421,"I am terrible at video games, so I gravitate towards simulations that are relaxing and easy. This is my favorite game of all time and I keep going back to it. Over the pandemic I put in a lot of hours because this was my happy place when the world was on fire. I find it clever, doesn't need as much brain power as other games, doesn't frustrate me, has numerous goals that are achievable that give feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction. I am also really happy they released a fantastic update that expanded the game which blended in beautifully. I am so thankful for this game and now all other games are held to a high standard. I can't wait to check out any other games that come out from ConcernedApe!"
6422,best timewaster 21st century
6423,"This is a fun game that outwardly seems simple, but has a lot of options of things to make and do. I am enjoying it!"
6424,.
6425,"Abigail is the best girl no doubt. I like her violet hair, I like her not being black like Maru and her smile makes me cum every Wednesday in front of closed-Pierre's General Store. Best of all, she does the ""UwU"" thing in my dream every night which truly made her the best e-girl character you can find in any girls you've met IRL (if you met one though). Her personality made me felt the charm of real love. She could be a Twitch Streamer whom makes lots of money from those virgins and let me fuck aggressively at everywhere, anytime."
6426,quit scrolling through reviews and just buy it
6427,"I think this game is a lot of fun, especially when playing with a friend. This game is fun to relax with and play casually. For competitive players, there are also many areas for optimization in the game."
6428,"Game is amazing, relaxing, and extremely addictive. There are a ton of easter eggs and story in the game if you just pay attention. if you liked the old harvest moon's then this is definitely for you."
6429,"Fun and relaxing game. Despite being quite content rich and somewhat advanced later on it does not overwhelm like for instance Terraria does. I only wish dungeons (skull cavern, deeper mines and volcano) were done better. You know, anything other than favoring bombing the living hell out of everything."
6430,i love Clint but can't marry him.
6431,it like minecraft but i guess with more crafting and less mining i suppose
6432,make me happy. little farm :)
6433,"This is an amazing game.  The story is great, the game's ""play cycle"" is downright addicting, and the developer continued to release new content for the game for half a decade.  I'm a dad with three kids.  I don't get a lot of time to play video games and look at my play time.  That tells you all you need to know.  If I sink 40-50 hours into something, it's pretty good.  If I sink 100+ hours into something (like I did for this) it's a freaking masterpiece.  Easily a Top-5 game of all time for me."
6434,"I played a single 100% play through and it was some of the most fun I've ever had in a video game. I cannot recommend this game enough, it is fully worth the small price for the amount of content."
6435,This game is fire I love overthrowing the capitalist system and taking hold of the means of production myself. Nothing gives me more joy than seeing the dirty little Rat Morris get clobbered to death I loved it 10/10 out of 10
6436,"Hey, I've had stardew valley for about a.. month? I'd say it's a pretty good game, don't even get me started on the realism in this. The realistic features the developers took from real life and added to this game is insane. Really realistic game, and perfect for when your having a bad day and need time to relax. Actually, the perfect game to relax in. 9/10 would recommend. The only thing is that some of the items in the game can get a bit pricey but you always unlock it at SOME point. Overall, Really relaxing game, put a smile on my face whenever I was down and having a bad day, and overall a realistic and fun relaxing game. 9/10."
6437,M
6438,I have this game on my switch with over 700 hours. Realized i could use my console controller AND get mods on my PC so here we are happier than ever.
6439,"A lot of these games make it so hard to even find the people to talk to them. This has had a few moments of ""where are they?"" but overall no trouble. You do really have to pick one goal for a day though to complete, it's not really possible to do too many things before the day is over. The characters have been interesting and the tasks as well. There is a lot to do besides just farming. The fishing mini game is very annoying and I wish there was more ways to make it even easier by leveling and getting a better rod. And also the tackle wouldn't be destroyed after just one day of use, that is silly. Overall though, it's relaxing and enjoyable."
6440,"You will sell your soul to this game. This game is a lot of fun, it is a little bit confusing and a little overwhelming at the start but once you watch like a few clips about what the game is about and some tips it starts to make more sense. Also I don't think a game has made me use the wiki more then this one before, I currently have 18 google chrome tabs dedicated to this game. This game will become your everything; you will eat sleep and breath this game. You will find yourself strategizing how to make the most amount of money. This game will consume you."
6441,"This game is so much fun, if you just wanna chill out and play some video games it's perfect. so much fun, peaceful yet still have some challenge to it."
6442,"When I first got the game, I was addicted for weeks, one of the best moments being standing on the pier every day fishing for fish which I sold for pennies, not having a clue about anything.

And it was one of the most enjoyable moments in my life, at the cost of £11 and only being rejected from my dream university.

As I progressed through the game, I felt like I was being less and less rewarded, as the game got more repetitive. The same lines from the same people, the same tasks every day. By the time I completed everything, I felt like I was walking though an empty shell of the game I used to enjoy playing. 

My final verdict: I wish this game never existed."
6443,BEST GAME EVER!!
6444,this is ruining my life 10/10
6445,.
6446,"this game was more stress then my exam
"
6447,"I've never played a game like this before. I played for the first time, and before I knew it, I had sank five hours into the game. Stardew is very, VERY addicting to play. If you're on the fence, don't get caught up in the overall farming sim nature of the game--it's so much more. I used to watch a friend play Harvest Moon on his 64 and it very much reminds me of that. Can see myself easily playing this game for 150+ hours."
6448,"This is one of my favorite games ever!! I also 90+ hours into it on Switch and can truly suggest as a chill game.

6449,"If you need something addictive to relax and unwind this is it.

For a relaxing game it can sometimes be suprisingly stressful and fast-paced."
6491,"this game is completely worth it, you are able to so many things other than just farm, all the npc's have their own story. Though, i must say it can be boring at the start but once you really start playing it gets so good, i love how the years repeat because if you miss anything you can always do it again, you can also get mods which really makes it more fun. i rate it 9/10 and ive only played 19 hours (irl time) of it!"

6493,I grew up playing Harvest Moon from 1995 to around 2004. As many know the Harvest Moon and similar titles went down hill hard. Concerned Ape has truly created a perfected version of the old Harvest Moon titles.. he's a genius and Stardew Valley is a masterpiece.

6501,"My son and his wife bought this game for me and boy am I glad they did! At first I thought that it was geared to children, but NAH, adults like it too. This is one game that ANYONE would enjoy playing, even Senior Citizens will enjoy it!  Play it for a couple of hours and you'll see what I mean. Their are monsters, achievements, cooking recipes, crafting recipes, farming, raising animals, mining, and fishing and those are the just the ones I'm into. There are various farmlands with their own problems and perks. Join as a solo or a group. JOIN, IT'S FUN, IT'S EXCITING. I'll be there, come on. Mama"

6504,"In this game you play as a farmer. It may be slow at first, and you may think you used your money for nothing, but this game has lot to offer. Being a farmer is not mandatory you can also be miner and sell gems and crack open geodes. If you want to be s family man you can be one. This game is child friendly and still a lot of fun to play."

6541,"Very lovely, cute game."
6542,"So there I was, re-living my glory days from the N64 era and playing Harvest Moon 64. I used to love that game. After replaying it again a decade later, I looked into what other farm-sim type games are out there. I stumbled across Stardew Valley. This game is everything harvest moon could have been but so much better. I still can't believe it was created by just one person.

Let's start with the art - who the hell needs to buy an NFT? Just pop into SDV! The artwork in this game is beautiful, interesting, and very well balanced. Everything from the map to the character portraits. I used to be one of those pixel-art haters (don't judge, I've come around) and this game totally changed my mind.

The music is also perfect. It fits with the art style, the game themes and the season vibes. Not making this up, I sometimes put it on in my car when I drive to work because it puts me in the mood for earning money.

The character dialog is also well written and the characters themselves breathe life into the little mountain village.

Finally the gameplay. There's a lot to say about this but I'll try to keep it concise. First, my favorite thing is that there isn't anything that's missable and you aren't punished for not completing things right away. This is in stark contrast to HM64 where you're under constant time pressure to get the collectables before a certain date. SDV is deep but not overwhelming in terms of complexity. The gradual progression is easy enough to follow but still challenging enough if you're a maximalist. I'd call it a low-stress strategy game. Relaxing enough to end your IRL day with but interesting enough to still be engaging. The goals are more-or-less easy to understand so you always have something to aim at.

To summarize, this is one hell of a game and if you're looking for something relaxing I'd strongly recommend SDV. I can't believe that it only took one person to make one of the best games I've ever played. Bravo."
6543,Great!
6544,Its addicting! Game is been on my wish list for ever and my roommate finally got me to play it! FUN GAME MUST PLAY MORE TTYL!

6591,Don't question it; just buy the game. Do it. You will have no regrets.
6592,"this game is really the perfect game if you want to relax a bit. however, thats not all. this game has not just relaxation, it also has a bit of action, romance, mystery, and also a great friendship element. no matter which genre of game you like, you will most likely like this game"
6593,"The most low-stress farming simulator with amazing world-building I have ever encountered. Must play at least once. TL;DR at end. 

There is pathing in the game for who you want to be with skills that reflect it, even with farm types. The community center is great for the first timers, but Joja Mart also works for those who despite Pierre for being closed on Wednesdays (the audacity I know).

All characters have a personality and life and dreams, despite being in a small town, they're happy for the community, but also wonder if city life is better. That doesn't matter as much to people like the Wizard who shows that the outside world has a rich history of wars, environments, and race (shadow people, dwarves) disputes. These hints are sprinkled throughout the game and really mentioned after completing the community center (either path), but it shows how much CARE was put into the smaller details. 

The marriage system is cute and amazing, especially because all characters have vastly different personalities and styles. Each person has their own hopes and dreams (and problems) so you can see they're not always perfect and happy (despite how they initially seem). Characters have depth and fleshed-out stories the more you increase your bond so you get to see them in happy and vulnerable moments. Of course, this only matters for people like me who read and enjoy the story. 

If you want to be silly, you can do so much with the game including your own challenges or picking up trash out of residents' trash cans (just try not to do it in front of them). Rather than the traditional route, you can do the game starting wherever you want (with some small restrictions for areas). There is freedom and more to the game the more you do and more you interact with NPCs. 

There is no pressure to be the best because exploring is at your own pace. I did use the wiki to remember things because I had seen so much content on YT beforehand, but that didn't diminish the experience but enhanced it because I wasn't running around giving people things that would make them hate me. 

TL;DR: Play the game already and marry emo, nerd Sebastian."

Every aspect of a game is considered with deep thoughtfull details.
There is a social aspect of playing games, there is a survival aspect as you fight in the mines, there is strategy as for how you use or sell resources, there is building aspect of the game where you design your farms and house, and even pars of the world you are into, crafting, story and much to enjoy!
I highly recommend, and mostly wish this game get a sequel or dlcs.

The story and its characters are well thought out and and its not hard to get attached to them quickly. I will say, I have played this game on the Nintendo switch and the transition is a little awkward. Luckily, if you do have a preference you can always connect a controller to your PC and the experience is still the same :)"

6630,"you should buy this because it's worth every penny. i was never the type to like ""resource management"" or ""non-intense pvp"" games until i played stardew. it's easy to write off as a minecraft, terraria-type game, but once you play it you realize the genius behind stardew. it has elements of roleplay, it allows you to be creative in a challenging way, and you have different events to look forward to year after year. yes, after awhile, it can get repetitive -- but that's where the mods come in. stardew is incredibly easy to use mods on. even if you get bored of playing vanilla stardew (you can explore other aspects of vanilla like the other farms, some challenges, adjust the money margin, etc. there's so much to do in this game and always not enough time, and i think that even if you stop playing this for years, it's not difficult to imagine you'd play it again."

6636,"Don't get this game if you don't have a preference for games like this! Bought it to play with friends but found it to be staggeringly boring.

You do nothing exciting, you experience nothing exciting. You run a farm near a village, interact with the village people, do farming, fishing, mining (the only remotely exciting job that gets dull after 2h), and craft stuff for the sake of... crafting stuff?!

I don't generally dislike peaceful games, I love Raft, so I think the main reasons why I dislike this game is the lack of adventure and purpose. Playing this game felt like doing 9-to-5 chores and my ADHD has a clear opinion on such activities.

Probably a great game but not for everyone."

6660,"This game will always be in my top 5... maybe even top 3. It is just so good for me. The fishing, mining, farming are fun. But it's really the NPCs that give this game the perfect score for me. I absolutely love that everyone has a unique personality. I love the cutscenes and giving special gifts. The movie theater is my favorite addition to the game, seeing movies with NPCs has been a joy. There are just so many special little moments in this game that mean everything to me. I recommend this game to everyone I can. It really is such a special, great game. I have played this game around 5 different times on a few different consoles and it's unique every time."
6661,cat go meow
6662,SEBASTIAN BEST HUSBAND!!!!!
6663,most game ever.
6664,well this sh*t is good af ngl
6665,Best farming/combat/mining/fishing/dating simulator
6666,nice
6667,.
6668,"This is a really fun, relaxing game where you grow a farm, catch fish, mine ore, and make friends in a comfy town full of memorable characters and packed full of secrets and things to discover. Fans of other chill games like Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing will likely feel right at home.

Despite it's fairly innocent appearance, there is tons to discover and do in this game. Besides the obvious task of restoring the farm and planting crops, there's animals to raise, items can be foraged from the wilderness around the town, fish to be caught, there's mines to explore and loot, and people to talk to and complete quests for. This game is also chocked full of new things to explore and secrets to discover as well, and it takes a very long time to discover and do everything this game has to offer. My only complaints are that fishing is a bit frustrating and tedious at times and the game becames a bit tedious at the end once almost everything is completed, as there isn't much to do other than collect money, but these were pretty minor parts of the entire experience.

The game has a delightful, charming, pixelated art style and great music. It also ran very well, and I only encountered a few minor bugs during my playthough.

This game also has a healthy modding community, with many quality-of-life, graphical, and gameplay mods available online. Modding this game is also extremely easy compared to many other games. I'd highly recommend checking out some mods if you decide to get this game! A useful guide on modding this game can be found [url=stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Getting_Started]here[/url].

The game also supports local and online multiplayer. However, the experience in multiplayer isn't quite the same as it is in singleplayer, as some things clearly weren't designed for multiple people, so things like cutscenes don't always play for everyone, and there are numerous things that only the host of the world can actually do. However, it's still quite a bit of fun and worth trying. I'd just recommend playing it alone first to get the full experience.

[b]TL;DR[/b] This is a relaxing farming sim with tons of things to do and people to meet. Although there are a few things in the game that can be tedious (such as fishing or the late game), there's a ton of content and things to explore, the game looks great and runs well, it has a healthy modding community, and it has multiplayer. I'd highly recommend getting this game for anyone who's interesting in giving a casual farming sim a try."

6670,i love krobus
6671,"""You can be gay in this game. It's great.""
9/10 game"
6672,Games good.
6673,"Tis a great game, I have nothing but nice things to say about it. Except that they fixed the late night glitch so now you can't stay up forever but that is what mods are for. Even without modding or using glitches to summon items and just playing it all normal is fun and challenging. You grow crops, raise animals, make friends, get married, have kids, amass obscene wealth, become the hero of your town, eat maki rolls, and fight monsters lurking down in the caverns for loot. Such a well-rounded game reminding us what life could be like doing your own thing rather than giving your life away to a mega-corporation. Both options are available in this one, very unbiased. Similar in many ways to Graveyard Keeper which I also regard with high esteem."
6674,god haley is so hot
6675,yas
6676,"I have 1,301 screenshots it is a beautiful game and it is fun."
6677,Anything I say here isn't really going to add anything new at this point.
6678,"Stardew Valley is in my all time top five games I've ever played. I'm a fan of playing games that help me relax and keep me interested. I've been playing Stardew now for three years and counting. Still love it, it will always have a place in my heart. <3"
6679,I LOVE SHANE!!! :FLUSHED:
6680,fun game
6681,good game
6682,is good
6683,it aint much but its honest work
6684,"Me and my boyfriend play this and honestly love it. Easy to understand, the art style reminds you of Terraria and the play style reminds you of Animal Crossing! Such a fun and great game would recommend :)"
6685,I love this gameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
6686,Now i can hold my husband hostage on my farm. He'll never leave. Never.
6687,"Great game, I want a ape in the game though, I would take a monkey."
6688,Love this game! So much to do and see!
6689,"did you ever want to do chores that amounted to something? like pure gold? did you ever wonder what it would be like to live in a walkable community? or own a home? well, boy, you're in luck."
6690,It's pretty good.
6691,I loved the calming gameplay and the way you play! I love the way you can make your own farm and it's such a calming game!
6692,Best game that has ever been made
6693,PLEASE I LOVE THIS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA shane kisser REAL?? I DO!! I AM
6694,"mmmm farming is love, farming is life"
6695,"Perfect game if you are looking for a relaxing time and will find yourself playing for hours 
"
6696,stardew good
6697,Buy it now and play it
6698,this is a pretty great game :D
6699,yes
6700,This is the dark souls of farming games
6701,Amazing game
6702,gud
6703,.
6704,"Amazing. The game is a relatively tranquil, farming sim. You have a farm and grow crops for money, but you can also fish, mine, craft things, fill out collections, and perform quests. You can make connections with the NPC’s and organize and personalize your house and farm. It’s a great game with lots to do and well-developed characters."
6705,sometimes i wish stardew valley was real and it makes me sad that it's not
6706,"why do we have hands?

6709,good. lovly
6710,"I like it its chill. 

I like Pumpkin

Horsey 

And other non sense that may spike the odds of you purchasing the game"
6711,"Love Love Love it!!!!!!!!! I love how it has some goals but overall there is no time limit to what you do, if you want to spend a day going around and seeing what the other villagers are doing, you can but if you want to grind in the minds, you also can. Despite it's unlimited time, it does have deeper storylines to uncover which i love!!!"
6712,"its super fun and addicting, but figuring out co op is so complicated"
6713,This game is one of the few ways I can feel anything that doesn't involve body mods
6714,"Not sure why I've never reviewed this game, from a player with 250 hours played at the time of posting, my only regret is seeing the bar be raised so dang high. I hope to see more games like stardew in the future, that just presents a fascinating and mysterious world to explore, with characters that ooze personality, that leaves you indifferent to not a single damn character, that lets the sandbox be the cherry on top and not the focus."
6715,"its fun when you seclude yourself and only work on your farm so every time you go in town everone thinks you're a freak but you're not you arent you are mentally stable everything is okay there aren't bodies in the floorboards they arent there anymore they're gone the smell isnt there anymore

anyways pretty fun game"

6727,"By far one of my top 3 games, there's so much to do, and the content within the community is amazing!"
6728,This game is pretty awesome.
6729,Addictive
6730,yeah s'alright
6731,"This game is relevant to the Troubles, also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, from 1968-1998. I won't comment much more in-depth on that because I live in relative comfort in Australia, but what I can grasp is that the world as a whole is moving closer to nationalism. With that being said, I give this game a perfect rating because it caused me to think. It had a strong impression on me, causing me to think about the meaning of the current state of what's happening in the world. Sure, I still have to get up & live my life but the truth is that we ALL have hurt someone or done worse but at the end of the day, it's realizing our mistakes & thinking about the effect it has on other people. I'm very aware that things arent that cut & dry but at the same time they really are. I enjoy a AU$56.95 of entertainment once in awhile to take my mind off things but this kind of game is getting harder to come across & deserves recognition. I've seen others comments about this game starting out slow & then ending with a bang or picking up....that's life. It welcomes you in & then spanks you. Last but not least, the graphics in this game are pretty damn good so in a nutshell, if your into games that provoke emotion layered with a historically based script & great graphics then this one is worth it. Enjoy."
6732,Pretty pog
6733,Very fun to play and is quite relaxing good for when you want to shut off your brain and chill
6734,its a calm fun game
6735,itsssss calming i loveee itttttt

6738,"Do it, the game itself is amazing. The mods make it even more fun!"
6739,"Buy for Sebastian
Stay for Sebastian"
6740,"This game is well worth the buy. You can get many hours of game play as well as have some pretty cute animals. 

It's a farming sim, with a hint of mining, fishing, and monster slaying. You build relationships with neighbors and fellow townsfolks. (you can even date multiple people..... Unless they find out of course lol) 

There's not a whole lot about this game that can be talked about since it's 6 years old. Most everyone knows about it and either likeor love it."
6741,I love stardew valley. It is totally my favorite game! I love the different seasons and all the different items to collect! I've never been so into a game ever until this one :D
6742,Best game to relax on and have a great time
6743,"I've never been addicted to a game this much. I have such a blast everytime I play this. So many things to do, so many things to see, and just by playing this game, it makes my day in real life. I can relax and be healed by this game. The gameplay and the pixel graphics are just outstanding. I think this game has the best pixel graphics in any games imo. Even the story is amazing and the characters are so unique and intriguing, which at first I didn't know they would be this great. Thought they would only be random NPCs. And thought that there wouldn't be any lore or story behind. But they have such rich stories. Actually my favorite part of the game IS the story and the characters. Highly recommend this game and I'm sure every newcomers will like this game."
6744,heals my soul

6751,super fun and have spent hours playing with friends. There is a little bit of everything in the game so if you are not a big fan of certain activities you can still finish the game by doing the things you enjoy.
6752,"literally the perfect game
"
6753,Just do it.
6754,"I have played Stardew Valley for a total of 160 hours (Mobile + Steam). 55 Hours in the first week, I can confirm that it's extremely addicting. I definitely recommend this gem"

6758,yes
6759,"It's such a fun, chill game :D"
6760,Good Game
6761,Very satisfying!!
6762,I started on mobile and loved it and bought it on Steam. There are some cool features you can't get on the phone but a huge drawback when it comes to mining/combat and brewing I haven't figured out yet. Overall I love the game after 2 years of playing and don't see myself stopping anytime soon.
6763,Dog
6764,it is marvelous.  It is diversified and with great depth and feeling. Even the music.
6765,"oh man, this game is so fun, i absolutely love it"

6777,"good game
"
6778,perfect comfort game.
6779,Love that its a more do things at ur own pace kinda game
6780,"I love this game. 

It has plenty to do and the multiplayer makes it even better. There's always something different for everyone to do.

Single player you can zone out and work on your farm without any rush. There are time sensitive missions (complete by the end of the day/end of the week) but you don't have to do them. I'm pretty sure even if you fail you can try again later.

But I really do recommend this game Multiplayer. It makes everything a lot easier and makes things go a lot more smoothly. While you can't get immersed like you can in single player, it means if you really hate doing something your friend loves - you're off the hook! Just make sure you have friends who pull their own weight."
6781,Very chill and relaxing game. I do hate the stone golems tho.
6782,I love how cozy the game is. If you're into farming/cozy games I definitely recommend giving this game a try!
6783,just amazing <3
6784,GREAT GAME
6785,"I love this game so much, I have it on my phone, laptop, pc. Can't get enough of it."
6786,"One of my all time favorite games! So fun, so chill, so cute! If you love farming, a simple platform, engaging storytelling and just pure joy, this game is for you! I have 306 hours in this game, including some more on the android-version. If that doesn't say it all, I don't know what will! Cannot recommend enough!!! <3"
6787,"Fun farm game

Played the game to calm down after playing the eldrich horror that is bloodborne

Grow vegetable to remain sane"
6788,DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. I CANT STOP
6789,It is Good
6790,lovely
6791,Stardew is an amazing game that i would highly recommend o players of any age! it's a very easy playing game that doesn't need a lot of skill.
6792,best game
6793,i love it
6794,.
6795,d
6796,"Its very cute and has a lot to do, you can also join up with friends if you want. Overall I like it a lot and will be going for perfection  :)"
6797,A really great game for anyone!
6798,เอาเป็นว่าไม่ต้องมีคำอธิบายอะไรมากนัก นี่คือ harvest moon ในยุคใหม่ ที่มีการพัฒนาอะไรหลายๆอย่างให้น่าสนใจมากยิ่งขึ้น (ลงม็อดเองก็ได้ด้วยอะนะ) ถึงเกมจะออกมานานแล้ว แต่ผู้สร้างก็ยังคงอัพเดตให้ฟรีๆอยู่เรื่อยๆเลย โดยรวมคือดี-ดีที่สุด ซื้อมาเล่นซะ
6799,it's the best game of farm that i ever seen I really recomend
6800,Pretty nice game (Y)
6801,very cool farming game
6802,I love everything about this game.
6803,it's really relaxing and fun to play after school.
6804,"if you are looking for a game to chill on then this is the one
its fun and i love the old school theme
10/10 would recommend
"
6805,Because it's a great game and there is a lot to do so you won't get bored. i Love the game
6806,Very fun to play for long hours and you can always make a new farm to try out different methods. You're not forced to do something the full day either. My only problem is Marnie's Ranch being closed Monday and Tuesday and me having no hay for animals :'))
6807,"I'm pretty satisfied with what I got out of it after 24 hours, and there is still plenty more to do for someone who really gets into this type of game."
6808,amazing game
6809,dog
6810,Best game ever created!
6811,one of my favorite games. got me through many a tough time
6812,"Simply the best harvest-moon-like there is.  Period.  The game is years old at this point, but still the developer comes with regular, substantial updates.  This is one of those great games that you can sink a lot of time into, and it feels like it was worth it in the end.  Then you can come back in a few months and do it all again."
6813,"The multiplayer has frequent lags and disconnection, even with good internet. I hope this gets fixed. But if you will play without multiplayer then the game is good."
6814,penny hot
6815,"Tis a good game
"
6816,"I'm a simple man.

Seeds planted.
Crops watered.
Fridays at the saloon.
Fish on the weekends.
Wife in bed.

repeat.

life is good here in the valley."
6817,yes
6818,i thought this game would be boring because im more into shooting games and stuff like that but its actually good
6819,"By far my absolute favourite game! Seriously, this game is absolutely phenomenal especially for someone like me who just likes to have a fun, casual experience when playing video games. It takes farming simulators to a whole other level with its amazing character dialogue, interesting side quests and overall amazing gameplay. It's just so incredible and I would recommend this game to ANYONE because its just so enjoyable!"
6820,the fact that automatic water sprinkler exists in this game is oddly enough for me to love it
6821,form
6822,one of my favorites. better than Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons even
6823,It's wednesday my dudes
6824,one of the GAMES ever made
6825,fish good
6826,Very chill and relaxing but full of fun things to do.
6827,"My life, my families life, taken. I haven't seen my friends in years.. the sun is a foreign concept, except in the form of pixels. 6am, I rise from bed - water my crops - the final peace. My only solace.
Through sleep crusted and heavy bagged eyes, I am locked to my fate. 
I mumble the sacred phrase every day, 
much akin to my missing relatives and the countless before or after me:
""It's time, to do the dew"""
6828,"Great Game, very relaxing."
6829,i want shane so bad rn
6830,"Fantastic addictive game, with insane replay value due to a thriving modding community."
6831,one of my favorite games of all time and one of the most relaxing
6832,I LOVE BEING A BOURGEOIS LAND OWNER. I LOVE PROPERTY RIGHTS! I LOVE FOOD!
6833,Ten out of ten would recommend. This game feels like a warm hug directly on the heart.

6837,good game

6839,fram :))
6840,Is fun.
6841,Such a wholesome game :D
6842,So i have plenty of friends who have played this game and frankly im no hermit ive seen it all over the internet but even with all that i hadnt developed any interest in the game. im the type of person who only pays for a game if its going to stay in my game rotation or something i can play with my friends and givin stardew has multiplayer now and i have over 90 hours in this game in a week i think this game passes all my tests
6843,Fish
6844,Fun and relaxing
6845,Recommend getting a slave to water your plants.
6846,Better than Farmville even though the graphics are old school.
6847,such a good comfy game
6848,"Great game, very addicting. Hard to pull myself away."
6849,"Its so cute and fun, worth every penny. Theres so much to do and so much time worth playing. Love it."

6858,"LOVE this game! I've played for over 100 hours and there's still so much more for me to explore! Every new thing is exciting, and the story kinda makes me feel free to do whatever I want, whatever I like most, I don't feel pressured to 100% it. Such a beautiful game, would HIGHLY recommend to anyone who's thinking about it."

6860,farm :)
6861,one of my all time fav games
6862,5 fingers our of a hand farming simulator
6863,buy it!
6864,So fun and chill with some story lines built in :)
6865,"Its really fun, and it suits just about every playing style. The only feedback I have is to maybe have some kind of mode where you don't have to do any quests and you can just relax and improve your garden or something, because the game is a little fast moving in my opinion. Apart from that, Its an awesome game, 100% Reccomend :)"
6866,A perfect escape from reality.
6867,"For me, I think the game is boring and difficult. Its price is exaggerated. I mean 47.00 SR for this amount. I can buy better games"
6868, this game is really fun and you should play it! if you like very slow paced games you should give stardew valley a try!
6869,fun
6870,its fun
6871,"I don't know what to say; this is my favourite game. I have it on Steam and Switch. I often have multiple games going at the same time as there's always something I discover I could do, or want to try out; like common-law marrying Krobus. This has been years of playing and I'm still a few achievements off on my ""beat the game"" save. I still need to try dating every single character at the same time; I've certainly divorced enough of them! I'm back to Steam so I can try the extended mod. And that's what I'm saying, I've been playing for years and I'm only now trying mods. It's the kind of game, that you pop on intending to do maybe 20 minutes, and then you're on for 2 hours.
Don't be afraid to do the Joja route. Screw the Community Centre; make money!!! Muahahaha!!!"
6872,Literally the best game i played in years
6873,ohmygod i think i am obsessed. i actually cant stop myself from playing for hours at a time. help.
6874,Yes

6877,"Stardew Valley is an amazing game and I absolutely love it. It can be very relaxing but also very stressful depending on how you play it or think while going from day to day in game.

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
1. You get to make your own character(obviously).

2. [spoiler]YOU GET TO CHOOSE WHAT PET YOU CAN HAVE!![/spoiler]

3. You get to choose what kind of farm you live on.

4. You get to choose which skills you build upon(i.e. foraging, fishing, fighting).

5. You get to decorate your farm by building and placing fences and paths as well as other things. Unfortunately, [spoiler]fences tend to rot and break, so you always have to make sure you have a high supply of them.[/spoiler]

6. You get to befriend the townsfolk, and even choose from a selection of men and women to romance...WHICH ALL OF THEM HAVE BACKSTORIES TO MAKE THEM SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING AND LOVABLE!!

7. You get to explore and earn rewards for helping the townsfolk and restoring the community.

8. You get to restore your farm and get resources at the same time.

9. You get the thrill - sometimes nuisance - of having to restore energy and health, and you can't stay up too late which can be a problem [spoiler]if you don't have one of the community upgrades or a totem that can teleport you anywhere based on the statue that you wish to travel to and you're in the mine or Skull Cavern. With restoring energy or health, it can be a hassle if you don't have much on you when you go to the mines. If you pass out in the mines, you lose everything you find there on that trip and sometimes more and you're taken to Harvey who charges you for a doctor visit or you will be found by Marlin, Demetrius, or Clint while they're in the mines for their own reasons, meanwhile if you pass out on your way home due to it being late, Linus or another townsperson will find you and tell you that they saw someone pick-pocketing you, so you lose money and some resources.[/spoiler]

10. In multiplayer mode, you can divide up tasks which could lessen the stress that one could possibly feel while playing Stardew Valley depending on their planning and time management.

Now I bet you're wondering why it can be stressful besides some of the very inconvenient scenarios that I've already stated, which happen to be due to poor planning or poor time management on the player's part. Well, trying to restore/build your farm while helping others, building the community, exploring to acquire resources, and romancing one of the bachelors/bachelorettes can be a lot, especially since [spoiler]even though it isn't stated directly in the beginning, you have 3 years before your grandpa's ghost appears and basically judges you on your work with the farm, community, and your personal life, which you do have a chance even after that to better yourself and finally lay his spirit to rest,[/spoiler] but some people can get very antsy at the idea after playing it once or [spoiler]seeing the note that grandpa leaves on his little altar the first time they play.[/spoiler] So nothing really is a ""con,"" at least by description, since it's mostly based on how the players play, but it still bothers some people, myself included. Only because I'm terrible at time management and I don't always plan properly when I go exploring. XD

Otherwise it is an absolutely wonderful game that I absolutely adore!! <3"
6878,"Still one of my favorite games and I wish there were more games like this. I wish they would continue with this game and make it even bigger with more expansions, or make a continuation of this game already. Every so often I'll still come back to stardew and play it over again. Such an awesome game with so much to do and the progression is just perfect."

6884,"I kinda laughed when Steam told me that I've played Stardew Valley for 9 hours. 9 hours is just the tip of the iceberg.

Would I recommend Stardew Valley, [i] hint [/i] I have over 250 hours on the Switch, over 225 hours on Xbox, and nearly 150 hours on GOG and an unknown number of hours on mobile.

I picked up Stardew Valley on Steam because it was on sale, to connect with other friends who have it, and for the Steam achievements. I would absolutely recommend this game 100 times over."
6885,"I  L O V E

So addicting"
6886,"I can't believe I haven't rated this game yet... It's a little good grind... little cute story... little escapism... lot of peaceful farming. I've bought this game several times for myself and others, and it's entirely worth it."

6904,"It took me a bit to start actually enjoying Stardew Valley, and I actually took a significant break from it. Once I got back into it, I couldn't put it down. It is that enjoyable. It's a bit overbearing at first and a little bit of a learning curve, but there is a lot to do in the game. Definitely worth the money."

6931,10/10 game
6932,Farm?
6933,hoeing like crazy in this game
6934,I got this game out of a recommendation by a friend and I really liked it starting off. The game is really rewarding near the beginning but then I found it starts to drag. The game is great and all it's just wants you to play as efficentally as possible to be rewarded for your time. I have put at least 4 days worth of playing this game in the past two weeks as of writing this and honestly the drag is not worth it. I want to enjoy this game but I can't do it playing the way it wants me to if I had a friend then maybe that would help but playing solo the game asks way too much.  I respect the story and all that was put into this it's just not worth the amount of time I've put into it.
6935,its a game
6936,yas
6937,"I am a 55 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
6938,Only played this game for 2 days now and it is easily one of my all time favorites. I would recommend this to anybody who may be interested in purchasing this game.

"
6994,"This game has the highest count of hours I have had on Steam. The gameplay is addicting and I absolutely love it.
If I had to change one thing, however, it'd be the social aspects. You just gift characters a bunch of times, and that's basically the only way to make them like you; you could talk with them every day, but that won't get you anywhere befriending them. Hell, when you marry an NPC, every single one has the exact same response, making them seem so one-dimensional in comparison to how great their arcs are.
The social aspects are really the only thing I have to complain about for this game, it's amazing with wonderful characters, whether or not they're pretty materialistic. Love this game sm :)"

7042,good
7043,It's a simple farming game with some light combat and most importantly fishing. It is comparable to Harvest Moon.
7044,This game is so fun and cozy and was really enjoyable. The thing that made me decide to get the game was because there was no timed clock above the crops or machines. I love farm games and hate having to wait an hour in order to slightly progress in a game. Thankfully Stardew isn't like that and instead allows you to take as long or short of a game play as you would like. The character build is amazing and I never get tires of playing this game. Can't wait for the new game from the creator to come out.
7045,"Lindo, perfeito, uma obra prima, um dos melhores jogos já criados pelo ser humano, que maravilha, que espetacular, primoroso, majestoso, atemporal, muito bom."

I play occasionally with groups of friends and we all have a blast playing together and working as a team to create the best farm/s possible

Thanks guys for making a memorable game and an experience that hopefully will never be forgotten"
7052,"Buena meerda, recomendado"
7053,"My favourite part of stardew is how relaxing the game play experience is. Whether I'm trying to balance many different parts of the game play or taking it easy I just find the experience is always peaceful and enjoyable.

I won't say more so as to avoid spoilers. It's an amazing game, with deep social, farming, foraging, fishing, and combat dynamics. Honestly, it has everything you could ever want from a game.

7100,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
7101,Very fun and good game
7102,"I have 400 hours on this game over 3 different platforms , its truly an amazing game its so fun as you start off with nothing and then the progression in this game is so good unlocking areas and short cuts in the game to make quality of life better and the experience constantly new , amazing events with all the characters all different events per character and the in game season events are amazing , the ginger island update is cool and would love to see another island in the game it was made by one person and artwork and music are soo cool ! 11/10 best game for 2021 and 2022 for me !"

7105,"Skvělá hra na relax. Když vám dojde, že vše můžete dělat za vašeho tempa, půjde to hrát lépe :).


Per the request of my friend, here's the review in English:

Great game for relaxation. When you realize, you can do everything at your own pace, it'll be easier to play :)."
7106,LOVE IT
7107,"Play this game. Please play this game. This game has stolen months of my life. Fun to play alone, better with friends, and when you get bored of vanilla there's an active and bustling modding community."
7108,This was just the best game I've ever played
7109,"This game is so relaxing i love it so much :) It's a nice game to play when you just want to chill and hang out, you can totally grind it to get perfection on every thing but you can also just mess around!"
7110,Mm good farm game. Favorite npc is sam.
7111,I love Haley
7112,"i mean it's stardew, what else could you say"
7113,came for the farm left with goth girl 10/10
7114,"Stardew Valley is a very fun game. It's a really nice way to wind down at the end of the day, and it's very sweet. Concerned Ape has made a farming game which also has a very compelling story. Even the NPC's are compelling, and you'll learn more about their stories as you get to know them. The remote and local co-op modes are lovely with friends and family. I like to play Stardew Valley with my brother, as well as with my fiancee."
7115,i like the casual-ness to the game and i find it relaxing to play.
7116,"So, so, /so/ addicting! I personally modded the heck out of it, but even just the vanilla game is super enjoyable!"
7117,Homey aesthetics with a relaxing vibe while also having a lot of content and room for adventure. I adore this game.
7118,it fun
7119,"I thought I'd escaped the pull of Stardew Valley. I'd downloaded it ages ago, played for 10 minutes, then shut it down for a couple years.

But then, I gave it another shot, as I was generally bored of the other games I had, it was too hot to enjoy the outdoors, and nothing good was on TV. And then I realized I'd played for an entire day. I mean, sunrise to sunset in the real world passed AND I WANTED TO KEEP PLAYING.

For such a basic, throwback game, it hits all the ""oh, just a little longer"" buttons. Just one more day and maybe you'll level up that skill. Just one more day and you'll be able to upgrade that tool. Just one more day and you'll be able to afford that building. Just one more day and you can finally buy that animal. Just one more day and maybe you'll reach the bottom of the cave. Just one more day and you'll be able to fill out that bundle.

It's repetitive, that's for sure. I'm not going to pretend that I load up a game thinking I'll do something new. But I'll happily boot up to let my mind wander while I fish, mine, farm, fight, and forage for hours on end.

Oh, and the icing on the cake? This game is weird. What on the surface seems super Normal Norman Rockwell pretty quickly spirals into David Lynch territory."
7120,Good
7121,mes adictiu que la coca sense que et rebenti l'envà
7122,"You start off thinking it's a simple farming game and then discover how much depth the world has. Fighting, farming, fishing, romancing, interior design, landscaping, building a wine and cheese empire, puzzle solving...there's something for everyone"
7123,fun game

7126,I HAVE THIS GAME ON LIKE EVERY DEVICE I CAN PLAY IT ON I LOVE IT SO MUCH !
7127,"fun, peaceful, realistic"
7128,its great
7129,best game ever
7130,"I didn't play the game for the relaxing aspect like many do, but I like the optimization aspect of the game, especially the side of capitalism. The collecting and progress mechanics are nice and the artwork is good as well.
Had a great time on the first playthrough so far, looking forward to more."
7131,This game turned me gay
7132,This game did wonders for my mental health honestly
7133,helps ease my troubled and depressive heart when playing this game. would recommend.
7134,farmville but good
7135,NICE GAME
7136,Super cute and great for a bit of escapism
7137,"i love this game! super satisfying and fun, with lots of secrets to discover. i've played this on various platforms and i cant get enough! its a game where no two players play it the same, with some focusing on mining, some on completing the community centre, some on fishing, and some on making friends and getting married! truly my favourite game, i cant get enough!"
7138,Works better than my lexapro
7139,"awesome game, i play it with my brother and he loves it too"
7140,"dont even think about it just buy it, 100% worth it"
7141,fun if its your type of game. though it can get a bit repetitive/boring at times (i mean farming and mining needs a little bit of work to make much progress) but the characters are pretty cool and there's just a dab of lore too so its worth the time and money i'd say
7142,good game yes yes
7143,"This is awesome game. There is so many things you can do. I never thought that farming game could give me any joy. And maybe because Stardew Valey is not only farming game cause that this is so unique and fun game. Bought for my son... and now whole familly is playing :D 
My advice is to not think about being 120% efficient. Just do what you like and give you joy. You like animals? Have a lot of them. Or just go exploring! Go phishing! Find friends! Have fun!"
7144,tbh im addicted
7145,Very nice game. I love women and getting beaten to death by slimes.
7146,"i cant really say how much i liked it because i used mods, but i do recommend  using mods!"
7147,Game is super addicting lmfao
7148,Farming good.
7149,Addictive
7150,bussin bussin
7151,do not like but play with friends
7152,This game is wholesome and such an amazing way to spend time by yourself or with people that make you happy. Its such an awesome way for me and my long distance partner to spend time together during the pandemic!
7153,The art in this game is very cute and I love that there is plenty to do. Plus the people who make mods have made some fantastic ones.
7154,"This game is so rewarding i let my cat play it and he wont step off my pc , help"
7155,dont get addicted but its cool
7156,literal crack. dating an adhd skater boy who plays guitar and id kill for him
7157,you must play this game
7158,I listen to Cannibal Corpse while fishing.
7159,"Ive only played for 8 hours yet i am addicted , the multiplayer is great too"
7160,masterpiece
7161,"If you're planning on buying this with the intention of playing on a multiplayer game, just don't.  There are so many issues around connecting to games, whether you are the host or joining another server. It's an issue that seemingly has been around for a long time and it doesn't seem like there are any intentions of fixing it. 

For single player, yeah its fine."

7173,best game ever
7174,it's  an amazing game!
7175,"really good, relaxing fun well made"
7176,I just can't stop playing this game..
7177,"It's fun and not a back breaking game. If you enjoy Harvet Moon (most people I've spoken to prefer this game vs HM tbh) or Forager you'll more than likely enjoy this. Fish, farm, fall in love.... or be the goblin hermit you've always wanted to be and give awful gifts to everyone young and old! 

It's pretty great. Have fun being a menace! >:3c"
7178,What an experience this game has been. It should feel so wrong to spend the day working on a real job and to use the little free time you have working on a farm and meeting a community of breathing characters that move Stardew Valley forward. This game has some magic to it that grips you and emotionally connects you with it. Highly recommended to play with friends who want to go together as a team through this experience.
7179,Best way to spend your time
7180,Woooo
7181,amazing
7182,played 4 hours straight i love this game always wanted to play it on pc because its better on pc and you can add mods but classic stardey valley is better in my opinion
7183,im addicted it's super fun.
7184,"Once you start you cannot stop. No thoughts, just farming."
7185,"This is a comfort game for me. I've never felt more at-home playing a game than I do playing Stardew. Even once you've gotten past the main story with the town, there's so much more that's fun to do in this game. I totally recommend it for anyone looking for a game to pass the time and relax!"
7186,v cute
7187,"It's so good, it's just SO SOOO GOOD! Charming on every level. It looks simple, but this game has a surprising amount of complexity. Play alone or with friends, both are great experiences. I think there's some magic in this game that most people could really enjoy."
7188,Farm :)
7189,this game fire asf
7190,honse
7191,Relaxing and beautiful.
7192,very cool!
7193,"I've been playing this game for years, and the creativity and diversity of the townsfolk still amaze me. Great game, definitely would recommend."
7194,FARM AnD FUN
7195,"I absolutely love the comfort and escapism this game gives me. Being able to build a life within the town as a farmer is so fun. I have it on switch, xbox, etc. I would highly recommend this game!"
7196,stardew valley. i love stardew valley. i just love it so much i could play it for a week straight and not be bored. i have married my favorites. i love stardew valley.
7197,Very fun chill game :)
7198,"Fantastic game.  Highly recommend this to anyone wanting a nice relaxation game that has more of a sense of accomplishment than some other slower paced life games. Combat being in it was unexpected and highly appreciated, the whole thing works together great. Honestly still shocked how just one guy made this whole thing. Give this game a try!"
7199,"This game scratches a few different itches at once.

From the farming-sim angle alone, there is a yummy sense of reward. Varying kinds of rotating fruits/veggies to grow and sell, ""number go up"" and all that, supplemented by mining resources and monster loot, etc., are the best in any game that I've ever played. In fact, both during an after late-game, it's both engaging and relaxing gameplay. 

I've never much liked dating sims, but the relationship system was a good way to incorporate substance in the NPCs a little more than just buying recepies and such. Good writing that allows for loots of choices, and I really dig good writing.

At least a quarter of my logged hours are AFK, and this is because the game does not allow for spontaneous saving without 1)cutting the rest of the day short, or 2) losing that whole day's progress, RNG and all. The only option is to leave the game paused if I know I'll be back soon. Not to say the game isn't REALLY GOOD otherwise, just the save-function is irritating."
7200,Sebastian.
7201,Bloody good game. Better to play with friends though.
7202,ballin
7203,"I've played Stardew for years but getting it on PC was the best decision I've ever made. Wonderful base game and characters, but adding mods has been great!!"
7204,i want my own farm now
7205,"A game full of mystery and love,"
7206,Very fun would suggest as a nice calming game.
7207,i love marrying random npc's by throwing gifts at them and then grinding for my farm. i love this game just make sure you are ok with being sucked in and never being able to leave.
7208,10/10 This is escapism at its best
7209,gud
7210,yes
7211,"I played this game
I am gay
coincidence?"
7212,"it's good, but only with 52 mods and another friend"
7213,over 800Hours in this game so i could be biased but if you love rpgs and relaxing games this is perfect for you.
7214,waste of time
7215,"Stardew Valley is game where you should prepare to no longer have a productive schedule, and instead youll be worrying about how to complete your daily quests before your homework assignment in short. It's good."
7216,Real nice chill time with or without the homies
7217,"In Stardew Valley, you play as Walter Hartwell White, a man who has moved to a farm in Stardew Valley away from his family in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The game sets you free and allows you to create the meth lab of your dreams and get caught in tense gang violence. You will develop or sour relationships with fellow residents, build your methamphetamine empire, and even commit multiple homicides all while trying to get the local police off your trail. Recommend this game if your into chill, relaxed, felony committing gameplay."
7218,Of course at this point everyone knows that SV is a classic. It's adorable and relaxing and flawless.
7219,i really like sabastion
7220,such a great game to play with friends for seven hours straight getting you through spring 1 in one sitting the night before an exam while quietly screaming as to not wake your dorm roommate who is attempting to sleep while you attempt to make fake people fall in love with you to cope with your past at three am
7221,Jogo incrivel!! So compre!
7222,I like fishing
7223,"Oh MAN this game is good! If you're looking for a cozy farming dating sim mash-up game with fascinating lore secrets and wonderful npc relationship building, then Stardew is for you! I've played for 100 hours so far and I still haven't discovered everything this game has to offer. 10000/10 would definitely recommend to new players (especially if they love Minecraft :3)"
7224,fun game with friends. Fishing mechanics suck but that is my only complaint.
7225,:) farm
7226,"Stardew Valley, is a game which you choose the depth you want to dive. It's a great little chill farm sim, fishing sim. rural town sim or whatever, but beyond that it's a game that can evolve and change with you and your play style. Its my comfort game. It's a game I play in my most depressive states and a game I play at my happiest times. It invokes the feelings of late nights of my childhood watching TV and feeling like nothing could ever go wrong, a feeling I've chased for years. Its just that kind of vibe. Will everyone jive with this, no, but its just what some of use need in this trying time."
7227,I frickin love farming
7228,Very addicting game
7229,forever my favorite game
7230,It's a really good game!! one of my favorites!
7231,"It's a game you can either play alone or with friends, although its pixelated one can tell a lot of detail has been put into it the design of each character, background, story and the npcs personalities. 
I would recommend this to anyone who wants to play a game with multiple events and storylines, aswell for people looking for something which they can play for a long period of time. 
Right now I'm playing my first run of the game and so far I've got two chickens named Legs and Tender, respectively.

:>"
7232,you know what this game is very relaxing and fun
7233,yes
7234,"i fucking love this stupid little farming game

7250,"Relaxing game where you can craft, farm, mine and combat. Lots of side quests, stories and seasons that makes it interesting to play. I enjoy playing it alone but it's also nice to play with your friends!"
7251,love this game omg
7252,"The game has elements that I like. There are building simulator, rpg elements, humor, and fun surprises. The primary reason I do not enjoy the game is that it doesn't feel like it has a point. The other issues I have with it are that It is a bit too grindy on several of the challenges. Also, it has time constraints that are too restricting to the flow of the game. I didn't ever feel like I could just go out and accomplish what I wanted to in a day, which I found frustrating, because to move forward you have to manage alot. Instead of feeling fun, it always feels hectic."
7253,good
7254,"Is cool

7272,"super fun, much more than a farming sim."
7273,"a game where you go away from the troubles and stresses of modern life, only to stress yourself into farming absurdly optimally.

best fishing in any game ever
the junimos are my spirit animals"
7274,its just good idk
7275,yeah
7276,A very enjoyable game that is simultaneously relaxing and stressful. A bit of relaxed farming with an incredible soundtrack in the background while at the same time you're trying to get the most out of every day in the game.
7277,OP
7278,i had sex
7279,top 10 all time game right here
7280,"fun, hard to start but once you do it gets fun."
7281,"I have a short amount of time with this game, compared to the rest of ya'll but when I tell you that time will zoom by likeit's nothing, I mean it. I played this on a whim, and I can safely say I'm addicted to it. Pixels may throw you off but the charm of the game is undeniably it's strongest point. Super fun with friends too, had an amazing time with my friends and just sharing laughs, and silly little moments. Great game, 10/10 would recommend."
7282,Potentially habit forming. 69/10 would play again.
7283,"I've played this game 2 different ways, with a group and by myself and both ways are a lot of fun."
7284,5/5
7285,fun little farm game
7286,"Great game
"
7287,Very addictive. For such a simple concept there is so much you can do and its well worth the price.
7288,"very good game, the coop is fun too, do recomend sharing funds. creates chaos. i play it much like the sims, where i play for a solid month, then dont touch it for antoher three, but i always come back for that good month of wholesome farming."
7289,"This is a great game, you just live the simple life you deserve"
7290,"great harvest moon game, very accurate, i have 3 girlfriends and no sex. 10/10"

7294,Hi
7295,"I love the game but if you are playing for a long long time, events like the moonlight jellies, night market and the valley fair get boring and repetitive.  Otherwise the game is great and I love it."
7296,"Really fun and relaxing, its nice to play with friends and on your own for hours at a time. The mods that people have made for the game have also been a great thing to add to your game play."

7305,Absolutely recommend this to everyone to play. I can't say anything that hasn't already been said but it is just such a fantastic game.

7307,good
7308,"Haley best girl, chill game, intense fishing experience 10/10"
7309,A very good game to play!!! Make sure to play it if you like games like terraria or minecraft kinda!!
7310,yes
7311,"This game was a lot of fun, whether alone or with friends. I would recommend it"
7312,"Super cute farming game with the kind of retro graphics that make my heart sing. I could spend hours just fishing, collecting crops and other items and just accumulating as much money as possible, but I felt a little rushed when the ""months"" ticked by and frankly, I sucked at the dungeon part lol. With that and after getting most of the low-rarity items I began to lose interest in the game, but that's likely a me problem since I'm an impatient and somewhat lazy gamer. I've still got a lot of nostalgia for this premise though so I should be coming back to it sometime soon."
7313,I will destroy Jojamart and become the sole supplier of all food
7314,yes
7315,good
7316,"great game, first purchased on ps4 as a time killer when isolating with Covid.
ended up buying an old MacBook air so i could play the game further with mods.
never been happier buying the same game twice! 
one of the best stress relief games i've ever played. 
thank you to Concerned Ape!
"
7317,"I have played Stardew Valley for years both on PC and Switch. Its the only game I can play even when I don't feel like playing a game. I find it so relaxing and easy to pick up for an hour and put back down. PC gaming makes modding limitless but even vanilla, it is a perfect game. You can play it as quickly or slowly as you want. Don't get lost in 100%ing it on your first run. Just enjoy it. Explore, make friends, build your farm. There are hours and hours of game play and coop makes it more fun. If you are unsure, just try it. It might be a bit confusing at first if you've never seen anyone play it but make those mistakes on your first farm and try again."
7318,"Stardew is so packed for a simple silly farming sim. Of course there's the normal pieces of the social aspect, all the plants, farming techniques etc. but then there's so much more in terms of lore, things you can do, having kids???? honestly its amazing and thats not even including the modding community, it's easily one of my favorite games and I think everyone should play it for at least an hour or so to get a real feel for it,"
7319,"the update is great and much better to play in than mobile, and mods are looking amazing on here"
7320,nice
7321,"It's a very good game to relax to OR challenge yourself too, romancing characters, building friendships and even having kids! 

And you can a farm with farm animals of course and with your very own horse"
7322,perfect for playing with friends!
7323,the most chill and stressful game at the same time 10/10 would recommend
7324,W ahh game
7325,game about life that more interesting than your life

I really recommend this game to everyone who comes across it. Please please PLEASE buy this game if you see it! To me, I would rate it a 100 out of 10."

7346,LOMVE IT
7347,I received this as a gift and it's adorable. It helps me stay calm while giving me something to look forward to. 11/10 would reccomend if you like peaceful rpgs with multiple different avenues you can follow.
7348,SO GOOD

7365,"I absolutely love this game! It's incredibly relaxing and it really just sucks you in for days at a time. It has very open gameplay, where you can pick your own goals or just mess around. The music is absolutely incredible and the game has plenty of support for mods if needed. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a more laid-back game or timekiller."
7366,yes
7367,Cute
7368,"If youre a fan of Harvest Moon, this is your game."
7369,what a fantastic way to escape the everyday dread of existing within a capitalist society
7370,"The perfect mix between relaxing, happy, stressful, and down right depressing. It also has great replay value, and a story that doesn't lead you, but rather guides you.
I am very picky with games, but Stardew Valley is truly worth investing money and time into."
7371,The female NPCs are like the crops. Thirsty.
7372,Very fun and wholesome game to play with friends and solo!
7373,I forgot what 3d looks like
7374,This game made me question my sexuality. The farming is cool too i guess.
7375,good game helped me stop playing valorant
7376,I've got 800 hours in this game and plan on putting many more in. The base game alone is extremely fun and well created. If you start adding mods though that just changes it entirely and can enhance every aspect of it. The creators of the game and the creators of the mods put in so much time and effort and definitely deserve praise for the work they do. Very well done.
7377,I realized this was a very very epic game once i found out the mayor was having an affaire with some old lady that sells animals
7378,"My husband of course always left me to harvest 1,000s of hops daily whilst he ventured in the dungeon explorations..Leaving me tired and depleted of energy and slight carpal tunnel..Nonetheless, it was an amazing game and we spent many hours as a couple on this game."
7379,actually good
7380,"I adore this game. I've spent countless hours building cute farms and making friends with the townspeople. I love a lot of the mods, as well.

Unfortunately one of the patches for the 1.5 update messed up the game on my laptop. It took ages to get it to work, and I can't use mods anymore. :("
7381,It gud
7382,"Played this game for hundreds of hours across multiple platforms.. and I always end up making love to Haley.
LOL I CAN'T FREAKING HELP MYSELF!
IT IS ALWAYS FREAKING HALEY!
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FREE WILL!

7397,good game
7398,excelent game .. one of the best INDIES of all time
7399,"I love this game and have many good memories in connection with it. Of course, it can be very frustrating when you get challenged and lose it. However, the success always continues growing - to the point where u are really fond of that game. Even if you played it once.. you can always start a new farm with different friends or alone and always have different experiences.

Love it. 9/10 (Cuz nobody getting a perfect score from me hehe)"
7400,"this game is filled with so much charm and love, I can't get enough of it"
7401,"Favorite game of all time. Fell for the Sad Chicken Man.
I think I need therapy."
7402,This is one of those game where you don't need to read the reviews. Get in there and start farming!
7403,Fun game very swag
7404,yes
7405,"Not much to complain about.
Fun but dangerous if you don't have good self-control.
10/10."
7406,Ver good game
7407,yes.
7408,"Even though after some time you realize what you're doing is just collecting random things for ""Junimos"" and there's no point in this game, it's still a good game. Mostly if you have kids and play with them together to spit duties and keep the farm alive and profitable. And of course fulfil Junimos demands... ;)"
7409,actually addicted to this game i have never seen a better game than this one
7410,good game

7419,"This is such a fun relaxing game, it's fun when you get cut-scenes too! Sometimes you don't know when they'll happen so it's always a fun littler surprise."
7420,Its a good game to past the time
7421,"fdgfhb'k;sdfmg';s
"
7422,"This game is so adorable and enjoyable; I could spend hours playing this and never get tired of it. If you're looking for a chill farming game that also has combat, character development, and magic, then this is the game for you!"
7423,Very chill game
7424,Favorate Game  Ever so many things to do such diversity
7425,It really sucks that they didn't bring back the classic animatronics yet.
7426,"One of my favorite games. I have purchased this multiple times across platforms and not regretted it once. I do recommend buying it on PC solely because of the mods you can add. The base game is wonderful as is, though. I was originally dismissive of the game but I am glad I gave it a try because it is such an amazing game. The main gameplay loop is farming, but you can also mine (with combat), fish, and forage. When playing co-op, you can have people specialize. Each day has a time limit of about 10 mins IRL, which easily leads to the ""just one more day"" loop and before you know it, it's 3 AM. You have a town of people to talk with and grow closer with as well. The game itself can be pretty long and there is a lot of content to get through. The sole creator and developer of the game put in a lot of love into this game and it shows. I look forward to their next game."
7427,"relaxing, cute, many things to do, and the branching skill trees are super fun, you can choose how you want to play. i love the social aspect as well, being able to become closer to the towns people. 
overall really great game."
7428,"This is one of the most popular games I own, but it has a little bit worse graphics than the games I normally play. I just started my first day and cleared away some of the land near my farm and used the hoe on the land, and then planted the parsnip seeds that were given to me at the beginning of the game plus I planted 3 green beans that I bought from the store which I thought would be nice because they keep producing more food every 3 days. The I got to the second day and I got a letter in the mail telling me to meet someone on the beach but I couldn't find them so I decided to stop playing there. People say that this game is really addictive but I am not sure why."
7429,"Great and relaxing game. Very good with friends as well. The artstyle of the game is my favorite part, it simple but so complex at the same time! Very very pleasing for me."
7430,A decent farming game with many aspects 9/10
7431,HypeFarm
7432,This game is really fun if you like farming simulators.
7433,It's stardew. One of the chillest games out there.
7434,It is calming and helps me with my anxiety.
7435,"KOOL
"
7436,Better than BF2042.
7437,It's a fun game!you can mess with peoples houses just by adding stuff in their house
7438,my safe place no cap
7439,"One of my favorite and most relaxing games to date. The mod community is *vast* and fun, I recommend Stardew Valley Expanded if you are mod oriented, but the game truly stands on it own. 10/10"
7440,"Absolutely love this game,It’s relaxing and adorable and I recommend this game to anyone who just wants to sit down and chill and play a calm game❤️😇"
7441,It's a great chill little game. Plays well on older computers too.
7442,"Game is super juicy and easy to relax, lots of replayability"
7443,Frogs
7444,"9 out of 10 J's

Dealers choice of Sativa or Indica with this one.
When I first played this game I was just looking for something chill that I could get the munchies with and still stay awake. This game fits the bill. Enough to do and it keeps pulling you back in. Haven't even found all the things to explore or do that I see on 'the' Youtubes. On my farm with some friends this time.
I would recommend bringing the snacks in before you start a joint venture with friends as there is no pause in multiplayer."
7445,fun and relaxing.
7446,Chill and fun.
7447,indie masterpiece
7448,good
7449,"yes, hell yeah, love this game its so relaxing
"

7451,"love this
"
7452,"it's a brilliant game but I can't play it because steam can't be bothered to fix (missing executable) and provide no information on whats gone wrong, thanks steam"
7453,WHAT A GAME 😡
7454,"It could use a tutorial, but it's similar enough to other games of this genre that you can figure things out."

7457,Fun
7458,Super relaxing and addictive. great if you just want to play to relax. I've been playing for literal weeks without stopping. I might have a problem.
7459,"Nice game, U can have all the relationships u don.t have in real life, cuz u don.t have a life, sad but true, i don.t have one either, this is why i am a hoe in this game. u can be gay, bi or everything u like cuz nobody is judging u. Have a nice time in  game ;)"
7460,get rekt
7461,"1000000000000000000000000000/10
so chill"
7462,"This is my favourite game of all time. It's super cozy, has fun storylines, and let's you explore the valley at your own pace! Even 300hr into the game there's still stuff I haven't completely figured out yet!

10/10 would recommend."
7463,Amazing game. The story about capitalism sucking out the life of a person reminds me of my real life.
7464,is really good
7465,"one of the best farming sim out there, because it is so much more. Just a small list of a few things it has lore, fishing, relationships, and so much more I recommend this to basically anyone."
7466,"Stardew Valley is a super chill game where you can play any way you want! You can farm, mine, fish, or any combination of those. There are so many fun events with the characters and the ones you can date are each different from each other and interesting in their own ways.  If you would rather date a different character or just spice up the gameplay there are tons of free mods made by the community. 10/10 would absolutely recommend."
7467,A great slice of life game of a farmer with good music and story
7468,its stardew valley people its the farming game of farming games
7469,"Great game! Can have cows. I think..
Reject Modernity! Go back to unga bunga!"
7470,I remember Harvest moon with these game. :( Very Nostalgic.
7471,very cute game! other than the weird stuff in it..
7472,awesome game.
7473,I first bought this game on my switch and then on my phone and tablet so I thought I'd try pc after I started gaming on pc and I love it so much on pc! This game is always worth the purchase! It's cute and it's fun and I love almost everything about it!
7474,Fantastic game
7475,cool game

7481,"Amazing game, if you got no patience this can teach you how to be patience and ""work"" for what do you want"
7482,I am a starfruit billionare.
7483,best game in the world. so beautiful and fun
7484,"i just played this god forsaken game for 10.6 hours straight, it is now 7:30 in the morning, i never got that goddamn sturgeon."
7485,"This game is addictive. It seems so simple at first, but it gets more complex as you progress through your first couple years on the farm and in the community."
7486,"it's wholesome, it gives sense of achievement, it has a plot, it has loves and friendships, it has animals and mayo machines. and a farm pet. AND A FISHING MINIGAME, which is the well known ultimate good-game determinant"
7487,Install stardew valley expanded for the best experience.
7488,But everyone is so lovely around here
7489,"A really chill farming game, it kind of cures you from stress especially after exams. Over all recommend this game 10/10"
7490,"This game is an amazing time sink. Its like a really good hybrid between the Harvest Moon games (kinda) and a general RPG. Like you can be no thoughts, head empty, or you can go full on and try to be as efficient as possible with everything. Every playthrough is different, from which love interest you might choose to which skill you feel like mastering first. Its just a great experience. At least to this farming sim dork it is <3"
7491,"Its so fun playing this with others especially my mom!

and the modders is so helpful and giving much more content to play! Thank you so much and cant wait for the next game and the next update for the expanded mod!"

7497,Not a farming sim very fun
7498,"81.9 hrs as of writing this review, the wine in my cellar still is not on iridium star. 10/10 would reccomend."
7499,Honestly such a sweet and perfect game
7500,yeah
7501,"I forgot to write a review for this game so I thought I would do an honest review for once. This game is (for me anyway) one of the best ways to release stress. You can start at your own pace, you can just go fishing if you enjoy that, and you can grow friendships with the characters. Although the game is a very good stress reliever, there are two things that throw it off from just chilling all day. The cave system especially is very stressful and expect to die (A LOT!). Another thing is the way that growing crops works. If you are growing crops and they don't grow by the time the next season comes, you waste the crops and they shrivel up. Aside from that, the game is very good and it is super fun to play with friends!"
7502,"i want to spend my whole life playing this game. the beauty of this game not only lies in the visuals but the experience it brings to the player through the music, the npc and player interactions, the many possibilities of how someone enjoys the game, etc. this game is very refreshing and relaxing. if this game were a physical thing in my hand, i would hug and squeeze it out of love and excitement. my love for this game goes beyond anything in the world, beyond barriers of any kind. i thank concernedape for making this game."

Relaxing yet the mines are exciting, it's full of drama in the most wholesome way and easy to play. I couldn't recommend it more."
7559,Good game for simulating your ideal ubercapitalist empire. Supposed to be a break from reality but dammit if it isnt fun to automate my truffle oil production

7576,"Stardew Valley is one of those games I will never get tired of. It was the first game I was gifted with my first console, and I sunk hours into it on Xbox. When I left for college, I got a PC and finally got this game as a gift and I have put so many hours into it. I will never be tired of the characters, secrets, the ever expanding world, and the freedom I get to customize my farm. The music is iconic, the animals are cute, and the mysteries are always coming. I hope to cone day finish it 100%, but until then I will continue to play and have fun doing my daily chores and adventures. Thank you, Concerned Ape, for making this amazing game!"
7577,Very hot
7578,"I originally played this game on switch for hundreds of hours and wanted to to get the PC version so I could download some mods. The game doesn't need it, especially if you're just starting out, I just wanted to have some fun with the mods people have made for this game. Stardew Valley is my favorite game of all time and has been a great comfort in my life during my low times. It's such a relaxing and cozy game to play and I never want to put it down when I start playing it."
7579,This game has some of the most detailed spreadsheets on the internet made for it.

7583,"This game is great for unwinding when you need to calm your mind. I love that you can build and customize your farm, get to know the characters, and start a family. Or you can just be the farmer near town with a slime hutch and all kinds of weapons and and fish ponds set up. There is no one way to play and it's great fun solo or multiplayer."
7584,"Awesome... just, awesome."
7585,Very relaxing game! I love it.
7586,very good
7587,"i hate you and your family, the person who made this game made my kill my sister because she deleted my world. frick you!!!!!!!!!!"
7588,"This game is incredibly versatile. Its beautiful as is but has a lot of modding capability. There is a huge player base of casual players and also a community of speed runners, so that gives you an idea of how much there is to do."
7589,i play this for like 7 hours every time i play
7590,Great game
7591,Abigail Very hot big tiddy goth girl👍
7592,"very cool yeah !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
play it please"
7593,this is the best game ever created 👁👁
7594,Fun mindless game to keep you occupied for hours
7595,"I am a 41 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 11 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories
"
7596,amazingly peaceful game full of fun and friendly faces. With plenty of twists and turns along the way it has enough content to keep me interested for 300+ hours and i plan to play it more!
7597,good
7598,hot
7599,"You really get a bang for your buck with this game. It's endless and you constantly have things to do, even in-game years into it. It's great and it's been one of my favorite games for years, and I'm glad to have it on here now."
7600,Great game for couples :)
7601,"Very fun, very chill farming game that has a story and easy to follow goals. I've played on console for quite some time and now PC so i can say that the controls and game-play experience are good for both. I'd highly recommend if you like repetitive tasks and NPC interaction."
7602,You literally just have to try it!
7603,Cult classic from 2016; can't go wrong with stardew
7604,"Get high with a wizard to ""become one with the forest"", have a shadow monster move in as my roommate, spend 5 hours straight fishing without moving a inch, put the mayors ""shorts"" on display at the town fair, talk to a human sized smurf at the 100th level of a never ending cave, collect golden nuts to restore a island, and yet I still get rejected giving someone a gold star parsnip."
7605,Awesome relaxing game
7606,Very good to chill with a friend/loved one and play this game. I love playing this game with my girlfriend
7607,"Stardew Valley is a very chill game, perfect for playing after a hectic day. But, it's also a great game to play when you want to be super organized, creative, as well as competitive. Highly recommend this game to everyone!"
7608,great game :)
7609,"Adorable, calming and stressful at the same time. Make a to-do list, follow the guides. Have fun"
7610,"the game is really good! Worth the bucks, you can make ur own farm,explore, upgrade an socialize. I do recommend this game, sometimes i find it a little bit annoying because my game lags when in the main screen and i have to wait a little bit because my game freezes , but I think thats just on my device 4/5 stars
"
7611,"sehr unterhaltsam
"
7612,moo moo cow
7613,i got it yesterday.
7614,"Extremely addictive game. There is so much to do on the game - it keeps it fun for months. Love that you can do whatever you want whenever you want, no set routine. Looking forward to new areas being opened up. Love this game!"

7621,"for 9.7 hours i hit rocks. idk what happens in the story or what goes on outside of where you spawn. but i hit rocks, and thats all it needs to be a good game"
7622,you'll get sucked in

7631,It's a fun and chill game with also a nice story line.
7632,"Serotonin go brrrrrrr
also there's a giant modding community out there to make the experience even better than the base game, HIGHLY, *HIGHLY* recommend if you love farming sims and hidden lore"
7633,cool
7634,"Super fun game, even if you don't download mods. I love the fact I can grow relationships with the NPCs in this game, especially since you can marry others. I got a mod that makes them look so fine (DCBurger's High Res Portraits) and it honestly made me want to flirt up Shane. He's actually sweet when you get to know him, and I feel honestly bad for him. Anyway, bought this game for my friend too and we're both obsessed with it. Recently wasn't accepted for a job because of my age so I have plenty of free time to waste on this game. Highly recommended."
7635,"so good
"
7636,Love this game
7637,pretty fun game
7638,Yuh!
7639,"I grinded this game for about 20 hours in a week to unlock a marginally better sprinkler system on my farm. the grind was actually fun though, it wasn't boring. Would recommend"

7642, very noice
7643,crop
7644,"Amazing game, you can get addicted to this game in an instant.  100% would buy no matter what."
7645,11/10 would recommend
7646,"This is one of the best farming games that I have played, but it is much more than a farming so much more that it hard to explain all of it. If you are thinking about buying it it is 100% worth the 15 bucks."
7647,great
7648,Really fun. A lot of grinding but its just too satifying. pls buy it. It may be hard. The tutorial barely tell you anything but its too good. Just search it up how to play it
7649,Very nice and relaxing game would reccomend 10/10 :)

7662,i love farming ! : )
7663,Very chill game until the season ends.
7664,"It has a little bit of everything, really. It's like, if you take minecraft and animal crossing and put them into one, then you would have this game. I highly recommend it."
7665,"Stardew Valley is the first game I played here, and even though I know next to nothing about video games, it's so much fun and gives you a ton of freedom to do whatever you want in your quest to make money and live a peaceful life on your grandfather's farm! I love the story and the interactions with the villagers, especially how they're all a little different and occasionally I'll be surprised by a scene I didn't expect. It's really relaxing and just nice to escape from reality by building one of your own."
7666,this game is super addicting be careful
7667,hot
7668,hi
7669,really fun to play.
7670,"what I would give for Alex to die.

7679,One of the best games i have ever played in my entire life would literally recommend this game to anybody on planet earth literally life changing only downside is i haven't slept it two days because of this game
7680,"Is EXTREMELY good. Too lazy to type. Artwork, music, gameplay, story are excellent. It's 8:23 AM don't judge me, just trust me. Buy it."
7681,game would be so much better is Demetrius was single
7682,A lovely relaxing game with lots of little features that makes it fun to come back to time and time again.
7683,"Stardew is a fun, relaxing game that has plenty of ways to vary your play, especially with the recently added farm maps. For anyone looking for a game that matches your play pace, Stardew is for you."
7684,Look you all know what it is and also I have like another 70 hours on the switch version lol
7685,"Pretty good, Defenitly for someone who wants to lose themselves in a game for hours"
7686,Great farming sim. If you like harvest moon games you will love this game
7687,"It's all the classic Harvest Moon goodness you'd want, but more and better."
7688,one of my all time favorite games. I own it on many platforms and cannot recommend it enough
7689,"A bit of:-
Bloop
Swish
Crack
Chop
and
Duyum
(Phonetic sounds of the tools...)"
7690,only really fun with friends imo
7691,very nice i like tending to my stupid little farm and riding my horse all day
7692,I LOVE THIS GAME! ADDICTED!
7693,"I try relax myself playing this game, only to feel frustrated not optimized my route and farming timing.

7694,"very yes game, worth every penny"
7695,so gud

If you haven't seen the closes they are pretty easy to find. Life sim tag is cooooooovered in stardew, run factory and animal crossing clones,"

7713,Good
7714,yes
7715,makes my tip sticky
7716,"god sent game i love it so much
"
7717,Stardew valley has to be one of the best games of the century it can range from being a chill casual game to sit there mindlessley while listening to the beautiful sound track it could also be a competitive mosh pit with friends while trying to get iriduim quality sardines. There is also a lot of tea and options between the npcs ( I prefer dating hailey while she is high maintence she is totally worth it) The options are endless this game is beautiful and the quality is amazing I do wish there could be more options like ending robins and demetrius relationship and be a home wrecker but hey you cant always get what you ask for. 10 out of 10 game would reccomend to anyone in the world.
7718,"Optimal farm. Wine Empire, Pig. I love game so fun and chillazijng. I could play this game while somebody is sawing through my ankle with a bone saw and i would be cool as cucumber."
7719,Pog
7720,"You can never really go wrong with a farming/life sim. Throw in mining, combat, and lively townspeople, this game honestly is one of my favorite games of all time (i have more hours on my Switch as well). I don't think I can think of anything negative to say about this game, seriously, this game is like perfect! Music in the game is relaxing, art style of the game is pleasing, mining & combat system is engaging and exciting, and building friendships with the people of Pelican Town is fun! The game even has ""missions"" you can complete to get farther in the story of the game. AND there's requests from the towns people that you can do, complete those requests for materials, money and gain friendship points to the person you help with said request. ALWAYS something to do. Raising cute farm animals is very fulfilling also, just a great game. Highly recommend to anyone who likes cozy games."
7721,Monke brain calm
7722,me and my bf. we are farmers bum ba da bum bum bum bum bum.
7723,very swag i like :3
7724,i luv this game n my baby junimos
7725,"A great game I keep coming back to. I have and will continue to recommend this to any player base. Whether you are a min-maxer looking for a speed run challenge or a laid back, plot enthusiast, this game is for you. I've played it alone, I've played it in a pair, I've played it in a group of 8+ (with a mod), and it's been amazing through and through. 

Not only that, but a shout out to the Reddit community, one of the most wholesome places on the internet <3"
7726,The game save on my phone has over 350 hours on it 🤤
7727,cool
7728,escapism

7734,"Very fun, super detailed games, all the charecters are different"

7736,Good game for people who just want to play a relaxing game one day. It can get a little boring so I recommend you play with friends.
7737,farm sim fun

7740,"obsessed
"
7741,Gay farming game is fun
7742,"This game, this game is perfection. I love it. I love Stardew Valley."
7743,This game is so peaceful and fun. Out of all games in my library I have the most hours on this one and it helped me get through the pandemic as well! Anyone who plays it will love it and I absolutely recommend it!
7744,A Game I've played for years and each time I replay I always catching myself not being able to stop... 100/10
7745,"I bought this game twice in a one month span. I will likely buy it again. And when Haunted Chocolatier comes out, I will likely buy that three times as well. Worth more than any $60 Nintendo game with half the content."
7746,ytup
7747,I need to stop buying my friends this game
7748,awesome game that ive sunken over 1000 hours into
7749,my plants noooo

7759,"It's a very fun, relaxing game. If you're looking for a game to just relax and calm then this is almost a perfect game, the days are quite long though."
7760,Good play now yes you like many times many places all good
7761,I love pretending to have my life together in a pixel game
7762,"I love this baby! Beware, this is hella addictive!"
7763,im not straight
7764,"This game is incredible. I have only played for such a short time, but the time I have put into this game truly makes it an incredible experience. Nearly every aspect in this game makes it a great experience, full of probably up to 200 hours of gameplay. Games like Stardew Valley are not games I frequent, but the incredible experience this game has to offer is unmatched with anything I have been able to find on the market to date. The graphics are beautiful, with loads of colour in each one, truly giving the town a beautiful vibrant atmosphere. The season system is also great, as it forces you to change up what you do for every season, which adds to the incredible immersion this game has on offer. I am ashamed in myself that I had not played this game sooner. However, the game does get somewhat repetitive after a while. But I say with great confidence that this is no reason the not get the game. I have and will continue to reccomend this to anyone I know. 9/10"
7765,epic
7766,"game is great just started getting back into it, it is fun with both friends and by yourself, it is also a great game to relive yourself of anger or sadness like what im doing now, totally recommend for all ages"
7767,very good.  that's all that needs to be said.
7768,It's kinda repetitive in a fun way with enough variation in the repetition to keep it fun.
7769,mmmm farming
7770,Really fun farming game

It sounds stupid, but this game helped me through one of the toughest times in my life. There's something extremely comforting about it. All I want to say to ConcernedApe is thank you. Thank you for creating this game, and for helping me and millions of others find comfort and happiness in our lives."
7773,Amazing game I have honestly spent too much time looking at stardew content lmao:))
7774,i liked krobus
7775,"vegetanble
"
7776,"I recommend Stardew as a multiplayer experience. It offers a lot of ways to set up multiplayer and in the game, there's a lot for 2+ people to do for hours."
7777,So friggin cozy and time absorbing.
7778,"It's the spiritual successor to Harvest Moon, and I put off playing this game for so long because I feared it wouldn't live up to the hype. I wish I picked this game up sooner and I can't recommend it enough to anyone who wants to relive the magic of Harvest Moon, or wants to play a modern classic."
7779,"A game where everyday is just 15 minutes, you will never get bored, there is just too many things to do and no time limits. Play how you want, when you want. I may sound like an advertisement, but I got asked to review the game right when I was about to play! Can't get enough of it, using a guide may help to get extra items for future things, but you never really need one. Play at your own pace, there's no rush, literally."
7780,fun
7781,I fish
7782,yas
7783,"LOVE it so much I bought this version because the mobile version doesn't have all the updates and areas. After I put in months!!! So fun and relaxing and also strategy is fun too, because you have to deal with weather and seasons. Buy it if you like simulation, mining, gathering, cooking, planting, and meeting npc's to gain advantages. Nice music and it's complex, but simple."
7784,i fucking love this game
7785,so basically youre this farmer and you can make cash. gaming.
7786,It's to complicated and confusing. There's no non-binary option. And stuff in game is insanely expensive with very few ways to get gold.
7787,"good
"
7788,good sauce
7789,"I've bought this game on every single platform. I think it's safe to say I love it <3 
This game has a strange bug that makes you open up 20 chrome tabs while playing though"
7790,"esta bueno, desestresate y ademas lo juego con el amor de mi vida asique solo tengo cosas buenas que decir de este juego. 10/10
"
7791,"Quite fun and interesting. Its a little difficult to figure out at the beginning but it's totally worth it, in my opinion. I'm truly satisfied with this game."
7792,"A man need a little break from our bizarre world. 
A man chose to spend his freetime in Stardew Valley though technology. 
A man dream about experience it in physical world."
7793,Honestly one of my favorite games. it is a very relaxing game to play while also giving you a lot to do that takes a while and many goals to accomplish without it being too stressful.
7794,This is def a game that really chills my out during a long day
7795,"In my personal opinion, this is a great game weather you're looking for something to do when bored, looking for something unique, or even something to help you relax. This game checks every box I have when looking for something new and exciting!
The music is 10/10, would rate it higher if I could. The characters are delightfully charming and the game-play itself is easy enough. I greatly appreciate all of the hard work gone into making this game and I think it paid of immensely. :)"
7796,"This game is a blast!

It combines everything I like about Minecraft, Animal Crossing, and Terraria; while still maintaining its own unique feel. The main story revolves around inheriting a farm, but there is much more to this game than just farming crops and raising livestock. I thought I would be intimidated by how quickly time passes in this game, but I found that I was still able to do my daily ""chores"" and still have time to do other things (forraging, mining, fishing, etc).

10/10 Why didn't I buy this sooner?"
7797,farm go brrrt
7798,"I have been playing the game since it came out. 

My phases of playing it have come and gone over the years but I ALWAYS come back to it, normally for a few months at a time. 

Despite playing since it first released, I'm always finding new things. It is a delightful experience alone and I've had even more fun playing with my friends. It brings back all the joy and curiosity of playing Harvest Moon as a little kid. The community for this game is also amazing-- mods keep it fresh (even though the base game doesn't need much to keep me engaged even after all this time).

In all, it's one of the best games I have ever played and is extremely impressive for a one man dev team...really excited for their next game : )"
7799,Obviously a fantastic game.
7800,i lkove you
7801,"Good game yes? very fun for whole family!
"
7802,is good stuffs
7803,5 Stars
7804,A good game to pass the time and has a lot of different options to enjoy. You do have to be careful not to overwork your character or keep them out to long as if you pass out there will be things stolen from your inventory.
7805,chilling game
7806,It's Stardew Valley.
7807,Mmmmmm Elliot *Gulp gulp gulp gulp* Zaddy Elliot can give me his babies. Mmmmm baba boy Elliot
7808,"Very fun, go at your own pace, choose your own adventure, type of game."

7815,Its pretty good
7816,good game 10 out of 10
7817,Cool Gameplay and Music. It’s really chill and nice to play. The mobs aren’t to strong and all the areas are cool designed.
7818,very good game
7819,i love farm
7820,"If you need a game to escape reality for a while, this is it. I've played for so long and there's still stuff I'm finding."
7821,amazing
7822,Just a really fun game! Co-op is really fun and a blast to do with friends! I highly recommend this game to people. You will enjoy it! I can simply play this game for hours.

7839,everything.
7840,great game
7841,"This game doesn't let you sit on people. So while good, it can't be considered one of the best games ever"
7842,"Best FPS i've played in a long time. 
"
7843,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOUR HOPE IS TO PLAY CO-OP

I currently have 5 hrs on this game and 3 out of those have been trying to figure out a work around the bugs i experienced while attempting to play co-op with my friend.
After wasting my time trying to find a way to connect to my friend's farm, apparently now i do not own the character i created yesterday and so all my progress is lost.

Obviously, after spending so long trying to fix the game i went over the time requirement to get my money back.

Thank you for wasting my time and money :)"

7851,"Stardew valley will always be my all time favorite comfort game! The gameplay is soo relaxing and cozy, plus the asmr of the environment is a nice touch. The design and artwork is absolutely wonderful as well. I also love how much diversity and lore there is with the characters too. I really just adore everything about this game so I 100% recommend it!!

7874,"A very nice, laid back game. Pretty hard not to enjoy it!"
7875,marrying Sebastian was the best decision i ever made. 10/10 would do again.
7876,"It's been a while that i've loved a game as much as Stardew Valley.   It's really a fantastic game that will absolutely absorb much of your time if you give it a good chance.  My only complaint is there isn't really a good 'ending' point.  It just kinda keeps going, which is fine, but there should be more of a definitive end."
7877,very fun
7878,This is better than any friendships ever

7897,SO FUN
7898,"If you don't like this game then you don't pass the vibe check.
If you like this game then you know it is addictive like meth. Seriously. 

I say just enjoy the game and go at your own pace, no one is forcing you to do anything but yourself. When and if you start a new game, it's always about being better than last time or it can just be a chill playthrough, you decide that. Plan your days accordingly, you can't do everything in one day or you will burn out in real life. 

Endgame is worth it in my opinion, you really feel a sense of progression throughout the game. At first the time limit, energy and exploration are overwhelming, but you get used to it, as I said go at your speed and don't compare yourself to others. 

The world record for the community center is like 2h30 or something, And a perfection speedrun was done in less than 24 hours, so yeah.. Don't push yourself if you don't have the knowledge or will yet, focus on learning, either on your own or by watching guides or etc. Learn new tricks and apply them. That's how you should play but honestly do whatever you wish, it's a sandbox. 
The really good stuff is kinda tedious to get, that is if you even get to the endgame. You thought it was easy? *laughs in Mr. Qi*"
7899,cute farm game!

It's lovely to get to know every character, there's an endless amount of ways to play the game, and a lil something for almost everyone I think. As someone that struggles with rage quitting, it's great to be able to take things a day at a time and complete tasks on my own timeline. There are so many small details that make the game seem so well thought out. 100/10."

7975,"Fun game.  I can cheat on my wife with every other girl in the town. Very cool, thanks stardew valley"
7976,"I must admit, I'm unsure why but I never really got into this game when I first bought it. Fast forward four years, a bunch of Wand of Sparking videos about it, and three of my buddies having a blast playing it, I decided I'd give it a faithful shot. Not because anything about it put me off or seemed uninteresting, but because I guess I never really got into it - What a mistake that was not to try it sooner!

This game is great! It's relaxing, the artstyle is wonderful (even though it's in my personal taste that I dislike how bright the colors are, a saturation option might exist but I'd have to check), and the gameplay is just perfect. As I describe it to anyone I'm telling about it: ""It's Harvest Moon on steroids.""

Another thing: I'm so used to saying ""developers"" when I'm talking about games. One of my buddies corrected me there, it's just ONE GUY who made this! Isn't that cool!? He had some help on some of the final stages (especially multiplayer support which is hell so that is totally understandable), but that's still amazing and this game is just a blast overall.

Progression, content, fun, likeable characters, it's all there. 9/10 I highly recommend! (No 10/10 because I try not to rate anything 10/10, no perfect game can exist but this one is the most defining of a genre so that's as close as you can get to being there!)

P.S. I know I have all five of the money achievements and that's because monkey me cheated in 2018 so I'm going to get perfection someday as an apology to ConcernedApe, this game is lovely!
P.S.S Everyone in my group who plays this (including myself) crushes on Leah lol"
7977,"amazing game, 10/10. Definitely worth the price and very easy to get addicted to"
7978,Very calming and fun with friends!
7979,Great game! if you haven't tried you should.
7980,I got this game when it first came out and ever since then I've been chasing the high. I've bought other farming simulator games and nothing quite makes the cut. I don't know if the Dev ever plans on making a squeal or maybe a new world. But I can guarantee I'll be signing up to play whatever game that makes me feel the same way this game makes me feel.
7981,like.
7982,yes
7983,"Pros: Fun farming game that will take you away from the stress of modern life.

Cons: A bug where you have 50 tabs of the Stardew Wiki open trying to find out how to be acearo roommates with this shadow creature."
7984,Absolutely awesome game! Super calming and fun to play with friends. Phenomenal game and would absolutely recommend it!
7985,Great game to teach your friends the real meaning of consequeces

You dont have to focus on anything  in particular, as long as you're having fun :)"
8018,i have a cat
8019,"This game is a perfect mix of what I like. I don't have to do anything, and can choose which things interest me enough to do. I can farm, or raise animals, or go to the dungeon, or build relationships with NPC's, or all of the above. It's very relaxing, and only as difficult as I want it to be. I can choose my own pacing."
8020,I like that the game allows you to create your own design each play through. many different outcomes based on how you interact in the game. the only part that i dislike is that the game has a clock that will make you pass out at 2am
8021,"there's a mod that turns all the npcs into furries, and then another that turns you into a furry, its a great game"
8022,fun
8023,"I've been playing this game for years and years now across multiple platforms and I always find myself coming back to it when times are hard. With the bright, warm colors and cheery music, along with the sense of purpose/productivity having daily tasks and making progress in the game lends, it's a perfect bit of escapism for when real life is Bad and you just wanna run away and be a cute little small town farmer."
8024,"This game is pretty fun, but it's really not a replayable game unless you get mods. It's pretty slow to finish, but the stories are interesting."
8025,"after 3 hours of gameplay, i was about to get off and i slept in my bet to save my progress and the next day when i got on eveything was deleted, i had to start from fresh, it never saved my progress and now im pissed."
8026,"calming, fun, and very time consuming. 10 out 10"

In all seriousness:
- Easy to play
- Super Rewarding
- Mining is intense but really fun and engaging
- Game is time based so you always have a rush trying to get everything done quickly (which makes it fun in my opinion). 
- You can name all of your animals and even get a pet ostrich :O!

There are tons of things for all sorts of different play style's"
8130,Brings me back to when harvest moon was good. This game has so much to do in it and you could lose yourself spending hours in it while only scratching the surface. Get ready to be looking up a lot of guides for this game!

8142,"This game was recommended several times by YouTubers such as lilsimsie, vixella, RyanFTW and so on. They all were very positive about this game. The main reason I checked this out was because of lilsimsie. She really sold me on the price at the time and it genuinely made me very excited to play and I'm so happy I did. It's so cozy and calm. It relaxes you. It gives you animal crossing vibes at times. Overall, I recommend this to anyone who loves farming style games mixed with the occasional dating sim *wink* *wink*"
8143,good game
8144,its stardew valley! come on you really cant go wrong
8145,"Personally, I haven't been able to truly get into this game. I just prefer more fast-paced  like Noita or Everhood, where Stardew Valley is very relaxed and slow. I still believe that this is a great game, the best of it's kind even, but if you like exciting fast paced games then you might not care about it.

8/10"

8149,i have over 100 hours in stardew valley on switch. 11/10.
8150,"Absolutely love this game!! I could spend several hours playing this, highly recommend if your looking for a relaxing way to spend your time!"
8151,Sebastian thats all
8152,"As of writing this review I've played this game for 121 hours across pc, xbox, and switch. I cannot recommend any game more highly than I can this. I picked this game up when I was at a point in my life where playing countless rpgs, action, adventure games had drained me of my will to play games at all. I felt addicted to my phone, mindlessly scrolling through various social media platforms consuming as much media in every form I could manage. 

I downloaded this game as a whim with some birthday money during the summer, and immediately felt excited to play a game again. I was drawn into an experience that felt hand crafted to enrapture me. Over the course of sixty hours on a single file I absorbed everything I could about Pelican Town and the Valley, and it left me craving for more. I purchased the game on on switch so I could play a multiplayer file with friends long distance, and I enjoyed every moment of this novel experience. I most recently purchased it here on steam so that I can begin to explore a whole new part of the Stardew Valley experience, the community of people playing it.

An even more handcrafted experience exists in community created mods, that alter the very essence of the game. No longer are you engaging in dialogue with ConcernedApe's characters, but those of countless others who experienced just what I have and who sought to create that again for someone else. I'd argue that this game all about community is heightened by the newfound community of players and modders I have discovered. To summarize my feelings about this game, please, if you want to engage in one of the friendliest communities around, and interact with and explore what it means to be part of a community, please purchase and play this game."
8153,Very cute and simple.
8154,This Game Is Amazing 100% worth the 15 dollars
8155,"I just bought the game on Steam, but I do have over 150 hours on the Switch. Every play through you start is different and I love learning new things every time I play. I highly recommend Stardew to literally everyone. It is my favorite game."
8156,"pierre sucks, 10/10"
8157,"I can't stop playing this game! Not only is the grind addictive, but you also get emotionally attached to all of these NPCs!!"
8158,Good game
8159,"I was expecting this when i purchased the game after seeing so many 1000+ hr reviews.
I was curious about the game due to its reputation so i still went for it.

And i do not recommend it, games can fall into a category of healthy addiction and unhealthy endless grinding feats, this one is just a toxic life stealing never ending addiction, that doesnt help anyone.

for me a game must have an ending, make you addicted and then let you go. ICO or shadow of the colossus, or katana ZERO are good examples.

but this one is designed to trap you inside forever, spend thousands of hours and make you ignore your life or health, no much better then a drug addiction, the irony is that this game is about living a healthy farmer lifestyle.

another trap in society camouflaged in nice cute aesthetics.

dont buy it. its an endless grind fest."

8192,100/10
8193,It is a good game if you like minecraft and animal crossing because it’s a mix between the two.
8194,"it's so amazing and cute, i really enjoy it!"
8195,yes
8196,"At first glance this game looked alittle boring and didnt really know what to expect. my friends wanted to try it out and so we got it. im currently 20 hours played in the game and there is SO much more to do in the game than the first glance I had made.  honestly addicted to the game. is very fun with friends. solo, could use some upgrades. but the modding community has that covered."
8197,Honestly I have probably played this game for hundreds of hours on different devices. This is the type of game that makes me want to download it on every gaming device I own (and my phone!). I've been playing since 2016 and have just gotten back into playing it again because I love it so much. 10/10 recommend
8198,no need for drvgs when you've got this i'm actually addicted help it's not a joke anymore i've lost all my friends to a fictional farm oh god oh no

8210,Great and addictive
8211,"Best multiplayer option for a farming and crafting game not only with fighting but also character development, intimate NPC relationships. It is wholesome enough for the whole family and interesting enough for couples to play on date night. It is the game that helped teach my daughter to read more fluidly when she was 4; she could read some words but was inspired by the game play to want to read more and not have to wait for us to help read it to her. One of the best games out there that we will always return to play."

8239,I love sdv! Me and my 11 yr old have played several worlds with different ambitions. Lovely calm game suitable for all ages.

8241,"Good
"
8242,bao.
8243,"A really good game, with a really good atmosphere. That something like this can be made by only one person, is absolutely mindblowing to me. I started playing this game on switch first, and have about 120 hours of playtime. that combined with the 80 hours here! If you need something to calm you down, or if your bored, i highly recommend this game. It is going to be worth every penny you pay for it!"
8244,"Recommended. Very chill game, a little bit grindy sometimes but very nice thing to play when you want to relax. Also, if you do not feel like marrying a character but want the marriage bonus, you can move in together as friends with a certain character. Also marrying an npc isn't locked behind gender, so you can be as gay as you want while living your dream farm life

Update: After 285 hours. I have achieved true perfection in the game. Even though I've basically beaten the whole game I still want to play. Took me until Fall 21st of Year 6, so I want to see how much faster I will be on my new playthrough"
8245,"I absolutely adore this game. It's so cozy and comforting, I love it <3"

8254,"This is the kind of game that really makes you expect more from AAA studios. It's sometimes hard to believe that this was created in its entirety by a single man working all alone on his passion project, but here it is.

The game is engaging, polished, and an example of how something doesn't need to be super flashy in order to be immersive. This is why I fell in love with games to begin with. What a triumph from a once-in-a-generation, incredibly gifted developer. 

I can't wait to see what he does next. If you are waffling on buying this game, just get it. It's worth every penny and I'm sure you have spent more on less, if you have bought any AAA title in the last few years."
8255,Very chill and fun game. Although seemingly innocent at first there are many things to unlock and discover.
8256,Iconic

8261,"This a pretty neat game cause there's a lot of different ways to play it. Do you want it to be a simple relaxing game or do you want to get into the nitty-gritty of optimising your farm and maximising profits? Stardew caters to quite a wide range of play styles. There's also a lot you can do in making your farm yours with customisation and decorations, as well as the different farm layouts.

Also you can get a wife or husband. Really the selling point of the game in my opinion."
8262,"This game is literally how you find the partner of your life or how to find wholesome friends. I literally spend so much time trying to build flower gardens in all my saves every season no matter what, you get a cute 8 bit style game, so much to do, mods that expand gameplay or make it easier, villagers that you can interact with, multiplayer where you can joking fight your friends on who gets to married first. you name it its there. Honestly this game is so much more fun with someone else to play with so like if you have friends and bunch of free time get your friends in and play with them!"

8278,Makes me moister than an oyster.
8279,"Stardew Valley is absolutely a must play game. You will not be able to put it down, I assure you. 

Your sense of time will be distorted and eventually non-existent. Your family, your lover (if you have any), your children (also, if you have any) will watch you wither away. You will not see them live their lives. You will not see them grow. No, you will be planting parsnips. 
When you finally look up, the world will be in shambles around you, before you too, finally fade.

8289,"HOW TO MAKE A CHOCOLATE LAYER CAKE
GATHER YOUR INGREDIENTS
Cake
12 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), very soft, plus extra for greasing pans
1 ¾ cups unbleached all-purpose flour (8 3/4 ounces), plus extra for dusting pans
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped
¼ cup Dutch-processed cocoa (3/4 ounce)
½ cup hot water
1 ¾ cups sugar (12 1/4 ounces)
1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon table salt
1 cup buttermilk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 large eggs
2 large egg yolks

Frosting
16 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped
8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick)
⅓ cup sugar
2 tablespoons corn syrup

INSTRUCTIONS
FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 9-inch-round by 2-inch-high cake pans with softened butter; dust pans with flour and knock out excess. Combine chocolate, cocoa powder, and hot water in medium heatproof bowl; set bowl over saucepan containing 1 inch of simmering water and stir with rubber spatula until chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup sugar to chocolate mixture and stir until thick and glossy, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove bowl from heat and set aside to cool.

2
Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl. Combine buttermilk and vanilla in small bowl. In bowl of standing mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whisk eggs and yolks on medium-low speed until combined, about 10 seconds. Add remaining 1 1/4 cups sugar, increase speed to high, and whisk until fluffy and lightened in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Replace whisk with paddle attachment. Add cooled chocolate mixture to egg/sugar mixture and mix on medium speed until thoroughly incorporated, 30 to 45 seconds, pausing to scrape down sides of bowl with rubber spatula as needed. Add softened butter one tablespoon at a time, mixing about 10 seconds after each addition. Add about one-third of flour mixture followed by half of buttermilk mixture, mixing until incorporated after each addition (about 15 seconds). Repeat using half of remaining flour mixture and all of remaining buttermilk mixture (batter may appear separated). Scrape down sides of bowl and add remaining flour mixture; mix at medium-low speed until batter is thoroughly combined, about 15 seconds. Remove bowl from mixer and fold batter once or twice with rubber spatula to incorporate any remaining flour. Divide batter evenly between prepared cake pans; smooth batter to edges of pan with spatula.

3
Bake cakes until toothpick inserted into center comes out with a few crumbs attached, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cakes in pans 15 minutes, then invert onto wire rack. Cool cakes to room temperature before frosting, 45 to 60 minutes.

4
TO MAKE FROSTING: Melt chocolate in heatproof bowl set over saucepan containing 1 inch of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside. Meanwhile, heat butter in small saucepan over medium-low heat until melted. Increase heat to medium; add sugar, corn syrup, vanilla, and salt and stir with heatproof rubber spatula until sugar is dissolved, 4 to 5 minutes. Add melted chocolate, butter mixture, and cream to clean bowl of standing mixer and stir to thoroughly combine.

5
Place mixer bowl over ice bath and stir mixture constantly with rubber spatula until frosting is thick and just beginning to harden against sides of bowl, 1 to 2 minutes (frosting should be 70 degrees). Place bowl on standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed until frosting is light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir with rubber spatula until completely smooth.

6
TO FROST CAKE: Place one cake layer on serving platter or cardboard round. Spread 1 1/2 cups frosting evenly across top of cake with spatula. Place second cake layer on top, then spread remaining frosting evenly over top and sides of cake. Cut into slices and serve."

After one last anniversary truffle, I proposed to her with a soaking wet necklace I'd bought from a dubiously corporeal stranger ten minutes beforehand.

8317,"Stardew valley is one of the most calming games I have ever played. It is one of two games I consider a comfort game of mine, as it really helps ground me. The game graphics are cute and niche with a pixel style. Stardew also doesn't follow a certain time frame for how the game progresses. You are allowed to do many different things as your character and are not required to do certain activities on certain days (though some events and activities are highly recommended :)). Stardew valley gives the player a freedom to explore a new town while also meeting new people and trying new things."

I haven't finish it yet, but I will eventually! I have no dislikes with this game at all. The only thing I would love to have is more npcs, events, and etc. Otherwise, like I said I haven't finish this game yet which I don't think this game has any ending!

8363,fun game.
8364,No other game that I've played has acted like straight up addictive therapy. I spent many nights crying to Olivia Rodrigo whilst playing this game when recovering from a break-up. Broken heart got fixed twice as fast and now I just play it without the crying. Fantastic game.
8365,Stardew Valley is one of my all-time favorite games! There is just so much to do and so many different outcomes. I have it on almost every platform and love it all ways. I highly recommend it!
8366,overall game is fun and great to play with friends :)
8367,Has gotten me through so much emotionally. Good times. Bad times. Worst times. Love this game!!!!!
8368,love this game sm
8369,I've played for 20+ years and a lot of games and Stardew Valley is just good. Currently on my 10+ run and 445h in and still enjoying it as the first time. Can only recommend.

8383,Dont regret a second playing it
8384,"My friends tried to get me to play this for a while. The way people explained the game to me did not do it justice. This is way more fun than I thought it would be. 10/10 game ngl. 
"
8385,This game is taking over my life 10/10
8386,Very calm and quiet game to play with or without friends. Very easy to learn with a lot of hidden stuff for the people that are really into the story
8387,"Get out your goddamn room already Sebastian, LET ME GIVE YOU THIS QUARTZ"
8388,"Very Relaxing Game; Go at your own speed! Tons of fun story, crops, fish etc to discover. Definitely a good game if you are getting tired of grinding or competitive games."
8389,"fun little farming sim. good to play with your friends, or grind solo. no complaints other than character animations clipping occasionally, boring marriages, and useless kids. cute animals tho"

8398,"I love it, so will you"
8399,Buy
8400,It a fun and a cailming game with alot of story to it i hope everyone enjoys it
8401,"Very cute game, I recommend to put mods though, cause then the game becomes perfect"
8402,"Played this vanilla on my switch but on here with mods is a game changer. Vanilla stardew is excellent, but modded adds so much!"
8403,"This game has many of the ""human"" elements that Earthbound mastered, while expanding into the farming-game direction without losing its interesting qualities.  Spent hundreds of hours on this, restarted several times, really enjoy everything about this."
8404,so fun
8405,gave me depression and vibes
8406,Fun too play with/without friends. Great stress reliever. I keep coming back to it.
8407,"A peaceful and engaging game. Lots of different things to do, and you are not forced to do any one of them! Overall very nice!"
8408,"Ah Stardew valley Hands down the best farming simulator there is around great music, long in depth story, all the MC's have their own little quirks as would any town in the world! :D and soo many secrets! can you find them all ?


I don't think i have any Con's about this game :P just all around good game ! more than certain it's worth reaching into that wallet/ purse to buy this little Gem!


P.S. Be careful the Pam BITES!!!! O.o"
8409,"I am totally new to Stardew Valley. This game is like they took pokemon, animal crossing and minecraft and mooshed it together into one game. I love all three of those games so this is perfect. I love all the different things you can find, farm, mine and craft. I instantly got addicted to this game and NEED to play it every day for at least a little bit. (Sometimes meaning SEVERAL hours) Although the in game days go by rather quickly, I suppose it helps keep the excitement high because you have to be decisive and focused. Especially if you plan to spend the day mining. Anyways this game is great fun, I love coming back and seeing my plants growing, also getting deeper in the mine, leveling up my character and collecting things for the community center. 

P.S. Fishing is WAY harder than Animal Crossing. Good Luck!"
8410,"Have played on various consoles and files. Lots of freedom to have different playstyles, variety of areas and achievements. There's a lot of end-game stuff that is expensive and takes intentional saving to get, but it's worth it once you buy it. The new update is fun and adds a lot more, and it's always interesting even though I've played it for 200+ hours total."
8411,"honestly just so fun. its fun even when you have to grind certain things, i have over 100+ hours on the switch version (yes i bought it twice) and honestly i have no regrets."
8412,"Chill farming simulator. I played the GOG version mostly and much more than I ever would have imagined. Very relaxing and fun game and with coop nowadays. Of course this is mostly a ripoff of Harvest Moon / Rune Factory but beautifully done, carefully crafted and with the possibility of mods."

8448,"Stardew Valley is one of my favorite games. The music is lovely, it doesn't lag my computer, the characters are interesting, and I can play with my friends. This game is absolutely fantastic."
8449,Great game. Makes planting fruits and vegetables and raising livestock a blast. Dungeon exploring and fighting helps break up any monotony. Interactions with townspeople could be a little better but is already very good. Highly recommend.
8450,Fun game.

8452,"Stardew Valley is the BEST. It's chill, relaxing, challenging, and fun.  Playing with friends is fun, as is solo play. Great escape from this chaotic world."

8454,JUST YES
8455,"Super fun and relaxing! can be stressful when you have a lot to do in game but playing with a friend gets all the stress to go away! very cute animals and easy controls!

8460,good game
8461,"This game is truly amazing. When I first heard about the game, I'll admit I wasn't all too interested. But after watching a bit of gameplay and giving the game a try on another platform, my opinion changed near instantly. The music is so peaceful and relaxing, the pixel art style is simple but incredibly effective for this type of game, and all of the characters have lots of personality to them. And, of course, the gameplay itself is super fun and enjoyable. 10/10, I absolutely recommend this game."
8462,"If you are at the steam page, you most certainly already have made the decision to play this game. so do it. it's great"
8463,oddly addicting. a lot of fun.
8464,very nice
8465,Pleasant farming/mining game. Best played socially and with the game wiki at hand.
8466,awesome game
8467,"skribbly nibblers, funky groovers, shawty's like a melody in mah head"
8468,farm :)
8469,Found that it has quite a steep learning curve for beginners but modding can help with that if that is something you are willing to do. Overall good game to lose time in. Can feel quite grind heavy at times though. If you are looking for something more purely relaxing or casual I would go with something else.
8470,brilliant multiplayer or single payer game and it's pretty self explanatory.

8475,What a manly game. love it
8476,"This is one of my all time favorite relaxing games. It has a very good story, good gameplay, can choose who you want to marry, decorate your home and farm anyway you'd like. A bit similar to the sims, but in a different way. Would recommend this game to anyone."
8477,I love this game so much. It truly is an escape. Thank you CA

8480,nice game awesome bals
8481,"This game is very play at your own speed, though time does go by and things are dictated by seasons. You are fully in control of how you want to progress, whether it is grind and aim for riches and getting things done quickly or you can tinker around and go the slower route. Tons of mods available for everything from quality of life tweaks to complete random chaos."
8482,"Ah Stardew Valley. It's a game that redefines the farming simulator genre. Actually, this game is one of a kind. You won't find any other game like it and it's an entirely unique experience. I love the community surrounding this game and the modding scene is actually still pretty active on a game this old. SO much love and dedication has been put into this game and you won't ever once regret purchasing it."
8483,i like the goats
8484,I like playing and playing with others and alone and adding mods is simple
8485,"i think i don't really need to reiterate all of the positive stuff that the steam reviews talk about. it's overwhelmingly positive for a reason. it's just overall an amazing game. i have about 78 hours put into this game, and i still feel like i have so much more to do. it's such a beautifully made and expansive experience that will keep you busy. i love this game and i would not be surprised if it suddenly became the game with the most hours played on my account. enough talking, just buy the game. it deserves the love it has gotten for the past few years."
8486,This game is everything i could ever have imagined Harvest Moon could have been when i was a kid... and now i'm an adult and have it all... i'm so spoiled lol
8487,"This game is remarkable. Its insane to believe this is only 15$ (not including steam sales) I 100% recommend this game to almost anyone. Not to mention it has co-op even though the game singleplayer is already incredibly amazing.

tldr: buy this game now you won't regret it."
8488,very nice and peaceful :)

8501,Its fun and Relaxing. Its my favorite game to play when I have had or am having a bad or stressful day and need to calm myself. Its also fun playing around with Mods for the game to add a little bit of Change to the game from time to time. I 100% recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a calming and laid back game to play!
8502,"Love that you can play this game at your own pace without any stress, you can make it to the end of the game at any speed without the worry of missing out on anything"

- Ruining mayor Lewis' life EVERY play-through.
- Mod-ability

Cons:

- Dialogue can be a bit repetitive,
- Lots of walking XD 
- FISHING IS A NIGHTMARE IN THE BEGINNING (works itself out through progression)
- Mod-ability (For those with no creativity and only enjoy vanilla ice cream.

I love the Stardew community that has been created through this too <3 I love taking this game at my own pace, but it is also a game that you can challenge yourself with! It is fun finding new friends on here and creating co-op farms together. Overall, one of the best games I have gotten into and am so happy to have found this game!"
8539,It is a good game.
8540,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

8559,"Probably one of my favourite casual games of all time, Stardew Valley is certainly a game worth investing time in. The endgame is very rewarding, and if ever you get bored of the base game, there's an incredible modding community waiting for you. 10/10 in my book, and a definite recommendation to those who have yet to experience ConcernedApe's masterpiece."
8560,fun and extremely boring once you look up one video and spoil everything about this game. I have no idea how I have 100 hours in this game.
8561,SEBBY!!

8563,"So good, couldn't rate it high enough. shane is my meow meow

8564,"fun game, although early progression is a little slow and some systems could be more engaging earlier (earlier access to casks for ageing etc). the late game does not suffer from becoming OP as time becomes the important resource over gold. great game overall"

8583,"its pretty fun especially the romance options, my favourites the depressed alcoholic"
8584,This is a very fun and relaxing game I just bought it only 3 hours ago and i'm  hooked onto it already and the price was reasonable because the game is just way too good and i feel like it is underrated.
8585,somebody please stop me from playing this game i've had it for three days and i have 30 hours on it. i have started to see pixels.
8586,
8587,epic :)
8588,"great game, i love it"
8589,.
8590,"This game is fun. This game has a vibe to it that many other games like it don't have. It's hard to explain what a vibe is but this game has it.  

The main issues I have with the game are quality of life issues. (Which most if not all can be fixed with mods) For example, because of how short days are sometimes you don't have enough time the first day of a new season(Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) to re-hoe/till the land, plant seeds, and water. Which can be the difference of getting an extra harvest and ton of money. This is the case even with iridium upgrades. This is simplified! It goes deeper then this. Which I don't feel like detailing. Best to play without mods and discover what those quality of life issues are for you and mod from there which is very easy. 

FYI this applies to each harvest besides the re-hoeing and maybe watering if you have sprinklers 

More examples is poor map quality/clarity/accuracy and NPC locations on map, The lack of Harvesting tool like harvesting with the Scythe(it's manual unless you have a certain hut as far as I know) 



"
8591,"Probably the cutest and chillest farming simulator you can play IMO. Sweet soundtrack, lovely pixelart, a bit of lore, and you can go at your own pace. Highly recommend it for those who just wanna relax and play a game."
8592,This game absolutely deserves all the love it gets and more. I'm not generally a big farming sim type guy but this game is just something else entirely.
8593,"Cant say anything that hasnt already been said about this game. Buy it, itll fill your soul with shit to do and whimsy that you cant really find in video games anymore."
8594,"Fair warning: you play this game sitting down like ""Oh yeah, I'll just play until I finish the in-game month""

The average month is like 8 hours irl. And it goes by fast"
8595,A lot of care was put into this game 10/10

For a game made almost exclusively by one person, he hit the mark. 

Great art style, greater music. Fun and interesting gameplay with everything from farming, mining, fishing, to finding love when you can't find it in real life. Cope. Stardew Valley is packed to the brim with lore, hidden secrets, and an ending nowhere near worth skipping. 

As they say in Letterkenny, Pitter Patter, Let's get at 'er.

8637,good game
8638,This game is a fun game and easy to want to play with all the different things to do
8639,Great game
8640,addicting
8641,this game is the most relaxing thing in all of reality. other than the in game fishing.
8642,"If, by the time of this review, you haven't played this game, then what have you been doing with your life!?"
8643,turnip
8644,makes me happy
8645,this game makes me float in the air with joy and sometimes i cry when i think about all the plants i need to collect. joja market and marrying people makes me angry but thats me. 10/10 play with friends and have fun
8646,"This game is absolutely fantastic. You can spend hours of your time having great fun.

8649,very chill
8650,good
8651,YES!
8652,"This is the one of the best games I've ever played. I don't like playing by myself, but the singleplayer in this game even makes me play it. The multiplayer is funner, but singleplayer is still super fun. There are many things  you have to do, which makes you play alot."
8653,good game doo approve  :)
8654,Don't even think about getting the JojaMart Membership. ಠ_ಠ
8655,"This is the most cutest roleplaying, grinding and adventuring game I love. At first it just seems like a farming game (which it is) but you get to do loads of other things, such as fishing, mining and making friendships/relationships with characters."
8656,"Pros: Really fun game to play and well developed game 
Cons: Too addictive"
8657,"This is my comfort game. If i'm ever stressed out, i farm here for a little while and then carry on with life.

If you're considering investing, but are not 100%, look up a playthrough and see if it fits your vibe. I did that, then bought it, so i'd recomend the game, personally.
"
8658,fun fun fun
8659,"Loads of fun, a very modernised retro feel!"
8660,mmmm sebsatian
8661,good game
8662,epic gamer
8663,"You can be a farmer
You can be an adventurer
You can be a fisherman
You can be anyone
You can have FRIENDS and even GIRLFRIEND what else can you wish?

8666,"Super cute! a bit like farmville, a bit like animal crossing. Days go quickly so your not waiting for ever for things to grow or for things to get done. relaxing."
8667,The game is wonderful but I'll never forgive Sebastian for putting up that goddamn skeleton wallpaper
8668,"It's a lot of fun to play with friends, though a bit harder by oneself. Though if you're not in any sort of rush, playing by yourself is nice too."
8669,slay
8670,good game.
8671,Super relaxing fun to play solo or with friends
8672,Honestly love this game so much! Its so chill and easy to play. And I absolutely love the graphics and game style. It reminds me of the original Pokemon games. Awesome with friends too!

It's a one man masterpiece and it's beautiful."
8681,love the game. very calming
8682,blue chicken
8683,I have almost 400 hours on my switch. I bought this on steam just so I could mod it. Worth it.
8684,Peaceful life simulator
8685,"This game is such a classic. I've played through the main ""story"" several times, and enjoy myself each and every time. I love the customization options you get, and the characters - while simple - are very endearing. One day I will 100% this game, but right now I'm content having fun playing through on my various farms."
8686,It's a casual farming game that I feel most people will enjoy. I like that the game provides a lot of freedom for the player while still having a main story/objective.
8687,"its fun
"
8688,Easy to pretend I'm being productive with my time
8689,Love it! 💗
8690,"Bought this for me and a friend when it first came out and it's a great game. It's so good I managed to get my sister to make a steam account and buy it so she didnt have to play on my account no more. (She wasn't of age when i bought it for myself.)

The game is amazing best game with AND without mods <3 I have to say if you play with at least the Stardew Valley Expansion mod after the first playthrough that brings in so much more to the game!"
8691,good
8692,"ccol game

8693,Its very relaxing and a great time killer
8694,fun and relaxing game. Poggers!
8695,I have never played a game quite like this one. It is a beautiful work of art.
8696,"This is by far the best game I've played in the last decade. It has a cozy vibe, the visuals are adorable, the music is magical, and the story is whimsical. I love the feeling of being part of a small village community. The game may be 2D, but its essence has depth."
8697,"mmm yes harvey yummy

8700,"It's cute and quanta, if you have friends you should definitely try to play with them and it adds an extra layer."
8701,Big Chilling
8702,"I've seriously never written a review for any game ever... but here we are

This has been my comfort game for years now! I have it on my steam account and my switch now. Love everything about this game. It has the right amount of calmness to it, with some challenging aspects that you don't HAVE to do in order to enjoy the game. Highly highly HIGHLy recommend"
8703,days move fast but i like it and the music a lot
8704,god i wish this was me
8705,I played the game thinking is was going to be a waste of money but i was def wrong.  I love the mystery to the town and the character development within the game. Don't want to giveaway to much information about the game but i would def recommend it
8706,"In my opinion, this is a game for someone that wants to relax after a hard day at work... or just relax in general.
The game offers plenty of content so you won't get bored and it does not have an end. 
You can play this game to infinity and beyond!"
8707,im gay!
8708,Game is one of the best games i have played in a while
8709,I played for 10 hours straight.
8710,"It's very calming and just easy to pick up. Some of the challenges may seem hard, but if that's not your cup of tea then no worries. This game has pretty much something for everyone."
8711,"Eh, it's alright I guess"
8712,I love this game
8713,fun to play multiplayer yay
8714,"Great game. Nice to relax and farm on your own farm, you can design it however you want, talk with Npcs, marry one once you get hearts with them. fun to play with friends and family 10/10 would Stardew anyday"

8729,really fun alone and with friends
8730,"Not a high stress game!
very fun"
8731,"good game, very farm"
8732,"This game is my source of happiness, my reason to exist, and my coping mechanism for every problem I face"
8733,yes
8734,Good
8735,"It's strange that a guy from Washington State, who spent 2 years of his life developing and launching this game, took over from Natsume who can't seem to make anything Harvest Moon related as good as this if their life depended on it. Indie Developer 1, Natsume 0."
8736,When I paid off all my debt to tom nook he didn't even teach me how to make a nether portal. But all in all Terraria is a pretty good game.
8737,its like minecraft but for gay people
8738,.
8739,haha vegtable
8740,proper good g
8741,literally one of the best games to be created in the world
8742,i guess it's okay
8743,Super fun game to play! Especially with others! The only bummer is that the game often freezes and you can't get it to stop unless you shut down the game.
8744,"Best farming simulator so far! There are so many aspects of the game which makes it unique. Not only can you tend your farm and grow crops, but you also have a variety of customizations for the layout of your farm, house, barn etc. The sandbox feature just makes this game stand out among others."
8745,"200+ hours into this game, and it could have been endless.  Love to play with my partner.  Will probably come back."
8746,"So, if you plant exactly 1 cauliflower, 1 potato and 1 green bean alongside as many parsnips as you can, then sell all but 1 parsnip and plant potatoes with the money made, you'll be able to easily buy 20 strawberry seeds by the 13th. Cauliflowers take 12 days to grow, you begin the game on the 1st so they'll be done by the 13th. You need 1 cauliflower, 1 green bean, 1 potato and 1 parsnip to complete the spring farming bundle, which rewards 20 speed-gro. Speed-gro allows 1 extra harvest of strawberries if they're planted on the 13th (aka when you purchase them). This raises your gold profits from 2944 gold to 5415. This is not counting farming levels or tiller profession, and assumes you're selling them raw. And if you can keep some strawberries to transform into seeds once for spring year 2, then each seed with a basic speed-gro will give you a profit of 756 gold (again, not counting farming levels, professions or transforming the strawberries into artisan goods). 

Yes this game is supposedly relaxing. Its not. Prepare the spreedsheets for some high-octane farming and NPC stalking

"
8747,nice farm poggers fishing
8748,relatively calm when you don't have all of the mods on at once.
8749,"From the moment I pressed play I was instantly hooked in. Not only is the game so well made, each character is well developed and made in every way shape and form. I love how the game also tackles very real issues and themes while also remaining wholesome. This game is better than Story of seasons, Harvest moon, and Animal crossing combined! And don't even get me started on the amazing co-op! I was even MORE impressed this game was made by one person! This game feels like it was built by a large game dev! This game is a easy 10000000/10! Love it so very much!"
8750,"wow farming, love it"
8751,foda pra krl
8752,addictive
8753,s'good
8754,"My good friend who is reading this review,

be careful, this game is a trap. I'm saying this because at first glance I thought I'd spend just a dozen hours playing it and that's it. I was very wrong. This game got such a very well game design and an amazing narration that it got me to play just so much time that it even didn't feel like so much time spent. I'm giving just my very deep thanks to the wonderful life experience I received while playing this excellent game. May we get more games like this."
8755,game good
8756,"Great Game, never thought I would enjoy farming so much."
8757,Fun and incredibly addicting
8758,Too much like real life
8759,fortnite

8765,"Cool relaxing game, Sebastian supremacy <3"
8766,BRO!!!! THIS GAME IS JUS
8767,While it may look like a Terreria and Minecraft had a child and then left it outside this game takes the look of Terreria and makes a whole new experience. If you like the idea of building your town up and making friends along the way this game is for you.
8768,"a good game, shall i even say art.. recommend"
8769,This game is so cute the art style is amazing and the soundrack is super calming. Overall this game is the best
8770,this game makes me wanna throw up and cry but i gotta milk my cows
8771,Arson.
8772,I love the authenticity about the game
8773,finally touched grass
8774,"I like the background music of this game its very relaxing in addition to the hobbies like fishing, farming, and others"
8775,"gut
"
8776,Game good
8777,"This game is one of my go-to's. and if you have the computer space, and are into mods, I would recommend using the mod Stardew Valley Expanded. It not only has new areas, but new NPCs, new monsters, new weapons, new quests, new events, and some other stuff that make the game even cooler than it already is! I'm not saying you HAVE to use it, nor am I advertising, but if you end up wanting to have a little more with this amazing game, it's worth checking out! 

Ps, Sebastian is so cute when he blushes !!!!! /////>_</////"
8778,Good game ^_^
8779,"played this game so many times, still doing new things.

8801,"I originally bought this game March 22, 2016, the year of it's official release. And now, after 6 years, I've officially completed the game and gotten all the achievements! It's incredible to watch a game like this grow and to be a part of a product that is cared for so deeply for by its creator and the community. I cannot recommend this game enough as it has engaged me and kept me coming back for over 6 years. Thanks Apple Blossom Farm for all the good memories!"
8802,Bought a bouquet from a guy I don't like and used it to ask out his own daughter right in front of him not even a second later. Also there are chickens so this is a good game

This game is quite easy when you just play it but the more you play, the more difficult it becomes and more secrets for you to discover.
The game have a lot of things to do: farming, ranching, mining, fishing, making friend, married... and a lot puzzle waiting for you to resolve."

8869,this game is my life 20000/10
8870,"I heard about this game a good while back, and actually at first played on Xbox. My partner and i have really gotten into it of late, and I'd seen some things about mods for stardew. Best $15 and 2 hours I've ever spent. obviously the vanilla game is still amazing as I wouldn't have purchased it and spent that time modding to play it AGAIN. Highly recommend. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea but don't judge this book by it's cover. there's a lot more here than a cutesy farming sim. (the mod btw is stardew valley expanded)"
8871,:)
8872,"it is so much more than just farming, and it has so much more than farming! magic, fighting, and literally packed with easter eggs. It can keep an easiliy bored person with ADHD sticking with it."
8873,Super chill game and super adorable too!
8874,Very entertaining and intricate game.  There is no tutorial so I didn't know how to play before watching some videos. There are many things I could see myself going for 10 in-game years not knowing if I hadn't watched a video on it. Maybe that's just me. Don't be discouraged if you are as confused at first as I was. Once you understand it is a very fun game.
8875,very good :)
8876,very cool

8884,good game
8885,"Outstanding casual game for family, friends, or couples."
8886,One of my all time favorites! Time passes me by so quickly when I play. Endless fun.
8887,"Yes, it so relaxing game even thought I'm new this game very difficult to me but still learning how to gain gold and manage the level I'm so excited try new things game hehehe"
8888,"I played it on console as well, and its such a nice relaxing game. A lot of people think its just a farming simulator but there's so much more that you can do in the game, including: fishing, having friendly and romantic relationships with the towns people, mining, and so much more. The map even expands as you get further in the game and there are secrets that you can discover as well. Please give it a try its such a nice way to relieve stress, to take a break from life, or just if you want an easy/good game to play."
8889,Good......
8890,"This game is like Animal Crossing but for kids older than 4 years old.
I like that I dont have to wait an actual year to find all the things."

8897,Why won't you notice me Hailey?
8898,"its good
"
8899,"This is a wonderful game that you can easily lose yourself in. The soundtrack is great. The game reminds me of Harvest moon 64 but more refined, balanced and much deeper. a farming sim with combat and exploration. My review will no do this game justice. Just buy the game and give it a try, it's great."
8900,Yes
8901,"I don't know how I managed to play this game well over 100 hours. A farming sim with pixel graphics is about the last game I ever thought I'd enjoy but for $5 I figured I might as well give it a try. 

The progression once you get your farm going and start working towards consistent income is pretty addicting. I can't tell you how many times during a play session I said 1 more day and then ended up playing 5 more because I always felt like I had a goal I needed to finish. The fishing mini game is also oddly satisfying and it's mechanics make it feel more rewarding than fishing in some other sim games (think animal crossing).

I also assumed that given there was no spoken dialogue, this would be a game to play with a podcast or video going on the 2nd monitor. I ended up almost never doing that because this game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. Each theme somehow perfectly fits the season or location and really does add to the experience.

Cannot believe one guy made this."

It caters to all gamer types. Whether it's quests, creator, time management, strategy, you'll surely enjoy it. Warning - you might get addicted and I won't be surprised if you spend a lot of hours. It's worth it."

8910,So zen :)
8911,"I have over 200 hours on my switch. I love Stardew Valley so much, I bought it twice! I highly recommend this game to anyone. My favorite game hands down. 
There's a lot to do, and you can have separate save files. There's also a tone of mods to make this game more interesting, but you definitely don't need any."

Worth the investment for anyone who would like to relax while building relationships, farming, buying from wierd aliens, mining in literally endless mines, mining in literally not-endless mines, rebuilding community centers, and of course, visiting the everyday secret club casino in the desert right next to an endless mine. Totally regular farming game."

"
8967,"I love this game so much! It is really calming and fun to walk around the little town and meet all of the villagers. Everything about this game is really sweet and the art style is really adorable! I really enjoy playing it and I love   the character design and how there is a different story with each villager as you get to know them, but my favourite part is probably how you can forage and find lots of food in the wild."

8972,A very nice game that allows me to relax and upgrade the farm.
8973,"Stardew Valley is a very entertaining game with a lot to offer! It's not often that I find a game that relaxes me but doesn't leave me bored, and this game is one of them. At its core, this is a little farming game with a charming pixel art style and lovable characters, but the story and plot brings even more to the table. From my experience, it's even more fun with mods!!"
8974,pretty worth the hype based on what i've played of it so far
8975,Harvey <3 :)))))
8976,"I played it for a few months when it first came out.  Six years later I picked it up again after hearing about the 1.5 update.  Big mistake.  Now it's a time sink especially with mods. 

I'm still amazed that one man made this.    


 

"
8977,"It's so so SO much more advanced and in depth than it seems at first. I'm barely even a quarter into it, if that, but I've enjoyed it so much so far! I would 100% recommend this to anyone who loves a multi-function game. Multi-function is honestly the best word for it with how many different things you can do in it."

Very recommended to play alone or with loved ones."
9043,Exciting chore game. Very fun with freinds!!! I recomenmed
9044,yes game
9045,"I've played Stardew Valley for one-and-a-quarter in-game years and I've enjoyed every bit of the experience.

You've probably seen the trailer — Stardew Valley is a life and farming simulator game, similar to the Animal Crossing series etc.
You're starting a new life as a farmer in Stardew Valley and you grow crops, decorate your farm, go fishing, go mining, go foraging, craft items (similar to Minecraft), and interact with NPCs and become friends by carrying out favors, among other activities. [spoiler]Apparently you also get to marry someone and have kids![/spoiler]
Of note is that the game runs on its own daily/yearly cycle, independent of the actual date and time of your system clock, where the calendar is divided into four seasons instead of twelve months (28 days per season), each season offering seasonal events, varying crop availability, and other awesome stuff.

There's a lot to like about it. Fun gameplay, beautiful graphics, refreshing atmosphere, nice music. I don't think there's anything I've disliked about it so far... I just want to keep playing the game more and more.

Just buy it. I promise, you will love Stardew Valley."
9046,yes
9047,only playing to marry Emily
9048,"If you play without mod and just base on the vanilla game then i salute you sir.

One thing that make this game really great is the MOD i highly recommend it to everyone who want to try this game.

Specially get the mod where you can date every single villagers and have more than 1 wive/husband haha."
9049,"Ah yeah we fishin
and farmin
and tendin to the livestock
and slaying monsters
and minin
and debating which pixel NPC is cute

Honestly, the game is amazing. It's probably one of the most relaxing games I have in my inventory."
9050,"Stuttering on 64-bit version, go back 32-bit version fix problem"
9051,What else needs to be said about Stardew Valley - it's an amazing game!
9052,"“Yes, I play Stardew Valley. How could you tell?

When I say I'm obsessed, I mean OBSESSED. In less than a week I went from running a tiny farm and making friends with the locals to running a millionaires blueberry/cranberry business and solving mysteries in the desert.

The graphics are a vibe, the music is super chill, and the whole experience is so relaxing (just don't make the same mistake I did of planting 300 crops with no sprinklers). It's incredible to know it was all made by one person. Thank you ConcernedApe!"

9131,yup
9132,"farm
"
9133,"Stardew Valley is probably the most addicting game I have ever played. The first 10 or so hours can be a little daunting, but once you get in the groove and realize what goals you want to accomplish first then those 10 hours quickly become 100 hours. 

There is a little bit of everything in this game from farming (mainly about plot organization and time management), fishing, dungeon exploring, and even a little dating. Game is very relaxing with short bursts energy, like when you all of a sudden find yourself on a dungeon floor with like 30 enemies."
9134,Fun game. Great with friends or alone.
9135,its good
9136,"Stardew Valley is relaxing, has lovely story telling, and lets you play how you'd like. I've played multiple save files and have enjoyed myself each time. 

The one thing I would caution is that it can be a little overwhelming in how much freedom you're given at the start, so if you're brand new to the game, I'd recommend watching some videos to get an idea of what you can do. 

Don't let that dissuade you, though, because once you get a rhythm going you're sure to have a good time."
9137,"great game and im obsessed but the buttons dont work when trying to attach bait or tackles onto my fishing rod, ive tried changing the keys and im at a high enough level and ive tried reseting my pc but nothing works:/"

9166,amazing game.
9167,Try to play a whole year without looking anything up
9168,"If you like the idea of Animal Crossing but don't like playing Animal Crossing, you will love this game. I have had it for about a week and cannot stress enough how dope this game is."
9169,I divorced my emo wife so I could have a shadow person in the sewers as my roommate. 10/10 good game.
9170,relaxing but also not
9171,great game
9172,"Yes,  Super chill game."
9173,"I’ve become addicted and I’ve played 50+ hours in a week. 10/10 if you enjoy games like animal crossing or sims. Both of those games didn’t hold much appeal to me, but Stardew is just the most fun I’ve had playing a game. It’s not even a major studio title, and I’d buy the game even if it WAS $60. Give it a try"
9174,Think of animal crossing but it doesnt rely on irl time :)
9175,Awesome game.
9176,No thoughts only Stardew
9177,"Amazing game with a lovely community , a most play if you like chill games with cute animals , farming and adventure into the mines and friendship and romance with the npc"
9178,"Cute graphics, charming music, impressive story line, selfless and amazing developer, wholesome community. 10/10, hands down favourite game ever.

Tips for newbies:
- Forage resets on Sundays.
- Mushroom cave is generally worth more money than bat cave.
- Clubs are way more fun than swords.
- Passing out of exhaustion/at 2am will lose you only money, but dying to monsters will make you lose items.
- Give Clint some sap for me, that would be greatly appreciated."
9179,"Pretty fun game, wish the time wasn't so strict. I also wish multiplayer stuff was more shared, like my friend made it to floor 65 in the mines,  but I still have to make it forty floors regardless."
9180,nice

9185,"First it made my ""I can fix him"" problem worse when i married Shane and did in fact fix him, however he kept talking about adult juice and he never cleaned his room and i realised I cannot actually change him fully just a little bit. I then got divorced. 10/10 cheaper than therapy"
9186,SO GOOD AAAAAAAAAASJFHNLKsf

9232,"Game is great on its own, but god-tier with mods and multiplayer. 

If you start looking to mod the game, I strongly recommend:
- Stardew Valley Expanded (+ all recommended mods on their nexusmods page)
- talkohlooey's seasonal portraits
- talkohlooey's seasonal portraits for SVE

9264,One of the best games I ever owned. Truly the way of life i want irl. This game seems so simple but as you know the npcs and the story its much more deeper then that. Truly a wonderful game. I havent stopped playing since i got it.

9291,Nice farm game once you learn how to do it.
9292,Its pretty good
9293,"It has no equals. This games is many, many things, masterfully done and wrapped together in a package of pure loveliness."
9294,"One of my favorite games of all time. I have nothing but praise for this game. Gorgeous pixel graphics and a super catchy soundtrack that never gets old. Fun and unique gameplay mechanics. The ability to take things at your own pace whilst also feeling like there’s always something more for you to do. Amazing post game that adds hours to the game that was added in a FREE UPDATE. Super easy modding support that quadruples the lifespan of the game. Tons of ways to improve your experience even after your third or fourth time playing the game. Update added the ability to decorate outside of your house, so if youre like me and love decorating that’s an added bonus.  Well worth the money and then some. This game could be $60+ and I’d still recommend it. 
Main downsides would be that if you’re playing vanilla, once you reach the monumentous task of perfection, the gameplay gets a little stale. Also festivals really are an early game thing that has very little impact or variation later on. You can play the game as long as you want, but everything after perfection is a little aimless. Still, I’d highly recommend this game. An absolute classic that almost everyone, regardless of age or gaming experience, could enjoy."
9295,Very relaxing game
9296,best game ive ever played
9297,love this game.
9298,very spooky psychological horror game!
9299,"Picked this game up at the start of the pandemic, and it was the best purchase I made that year. This game is so super relaxing, satisfying, and fun! I'll always come back to it, and it's worth every cent! I can't think of a single downside of Stardew Valley — it has everything I'd want in this genre."
9300,Yeet
9301,it fun
9302,"One of my favorite games ever, and created by a genuinely good dude. Takes about the length of the first Spring season to get into it, but after that, it can quickly become a game that you spend 100 hours in!"
9303,"get mods

9311,Such a great farming game~
9312,"a simple but extremely addicting game, lots of fun to be had and an amazing soundtrack to accompany it, a real blast alone and with friends. 10/10 would recommend."
9313,very good very nice
9314,You know what this is. you know you want it. just buy it.
9315,i just want to marry caroline
9316,"An absolute delight to play. Nothing in the game is unachievable if you just spend time. The graphics, townspeople, and story are amazing. Cannot believe I let this fly under my radar for so long"
9317,i havent seen the sun in a long time
9318,"love this game, easy enough for a first time gamer that likes adventuring more then battling & fighting"
9319,Been playing and still fishing. I love fish
9320,"Stardew Valley is incredibly engaging, I regularly forget what time it is irl when playing. There is much to discover and many different things to do, you can both follow the red thread by fulfilling the quests, but you can also completely ignore them and just free-play. Having the option to do both farmer and adventure style is very nice. The accompanying music fits well and is pleasant to listen to.
If I need to find something negative it would be that the NPCs are sometimes difficult to find when you want to end or hand in a (re)quest."
9321,"awesome
"
9322,Yes
9323,"This game is incredible. I had previously bought this on Xbox in 2020 at the very start of COVID and have put over 2000hrs into it on Xbox. Decided it would probably be an upgrade to play it on a laptop and bought it. 

I adore this game. It just fills me with joy to play it day in day out and rarely gets boring."
9324,"Very fun and relaxing, a must play for time killing days"
9325,good game. i recommend playing with mods
9326,i love slinging rocks at haley so much that i bought it both on switch and steam to do it twice at the same time

9336,My reality is the prologue of this game. Working in a cubicle mindlessly toying away. Still waiting for the day I get a letter from Stardew and get the chance to move and grow crops and pet chickens forever. I truly love this game for so many reasons. The main one being how relaxing it can be. 11/10 must recommend if you want something fun and chill to play. The soundtrack is also 11/10 on its own.
9337,good
9338,good

(fr tho, great game, would recommend)"
9351,"its cool

9352,Stopped launching after 12 hour play.  Cannot get a refund so do not know what to do as there is no support on Steam for this game.

9366,At first I didn't like the game but after trying it out for a while it became addicting.
9367,"I really like Stardew. As someone who got absolutely OBSESSED with Animal Crossing:New Horizons and got 300 hours the first month it came out. Stardew is just as fun. I really like the added aspect of being able to marry villagers. But overall after running out of content with ACNH. Stardew really helped me get back into the swing of things. Maintenance games like this really help me be more productive in my own life as well. I'd recommend it to anyone who liked Minecraft, Animal Crossing, or Terraria."
9368,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
9369,good
9370,very good like :)
9371,haley is so hot
9372,"This is the game for you if u have played too many competitive games and u are looking for a comfortable, feel good relaxing game . i started playing this game 1 year before and its still exiting like when i started playing the game."
9373,"This game is absolutely amazing! The graphics, gameplay, story, and characters are so impressive and never really gets boring! There's so many things you can do in the game and it's just genuinely awesome."
9374,"This game is so relaxing and engaging. It's a perfect comfort game that you can come back to time and time again. You can go days or months without playing, and come back to it and always have a good time. There are also tons of mods that can be added to this game to change up the entire experience as well, which is absolutely amazing, as it almost feels like playing a whole new game again. Absolutely recommend for anyone looking for something laid back, easily customizable and comforting. 10/10 one of my favorites."
9375,It's actually quite fun. Gives you terraria vibes. I dont really play it but from what i've played so far its quite enjoyable
9376,lots of contents to go through with every aspect of the game.
9377,yes
9378,"Stardew Valley is a game that i cannot recommend enough, as there is really NOTHING that can compare. It's got a nice, well rounded world to explore, multiple simple mechanics that weave together to make a complex web of paths to learn and master. There's also secrets! FARMING! FRIENDSHIP! ConcernedApe Made a real banger here."
9379,so calming and comfortable i love it <3
9380,Very relaxing. Easy to follow (walkthroughs available on the internet). Lovable characters.

9389,"This game offers a little something for everyone, and with multiplayer integration you and each of your friends can build a prosperous farm by each doing just the things you like most about the game. Be it the farm management, progressing the story, dating all the town cuties, mining and monster slaying, fishing in the rain, etc..."

9411,"good game because, and then, lastly, concluded."
9412,"I've had my fair share of games I've absolutely been obsessed with, but none of them can compare to Stardew Valley. I own the game on Steam, Switch, Xbox and yes, even mobile. There is ALWAYS something for you to do, it's insanely immersive and even when you 100% the game you can always just start over and get the same enjoyment out of it every single time. Not to mention the insanely active modding community that absolutely carry the game on their shoulders. No game has ever been able to successfully bring me out of a depressive episode like this game has. Could not recommend it more."
9413,4 hours played and having some fun ngl
9414,how do i kill shane
9415,Great Game. Love the controls and the multiplayer capabilities.

9425,i love selling corn
9426,i hate how you cant marry every character in the game at once
9427,"People often say that this game is relaxing, but the timer makes me feel like I have to do as much as possible in the day. I know there's no real penalty for skipping through the days, so there's no reason for me to feel stressed playing this game... except for one: I actually like feeling stressed. It helps me focus, and there's a lot of fun things to focus on in this game. Whether you want a relaxing game or a stressful game, this may just be the one for you.

[spoiler]Also, this is the first game that ever made me cry. That scene with Shane on the cliff was heartbreaking.[/spoiler]"
9428,pretty fun
9429,"More of an all types of life simulator, veryyyyy good game. Local Co-Op and good multiplayer system"

9438,Great fun. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys playing a chill game. Very gut ja.
9439,"Amazing game, i'm only on year 2 and I'm having so much fun"
9440,Great game that gives control to the player to grind and develop relationships at their own pace. Fantastic contribution to the legacy of Harvest Moon.
9441,"if i were to be trapped in a game of my choosing, it'd be this game because i wouldn't have to pay taxes and i would live a nice home
"
9442,"much love for this game.. wish there was more representation though, but still an amazing game :DD"
9443,The fact you can get a girl friend in this game makes me feel more lonely
9444,"This game is one of the best of the 2010s. An indie game that has way more heart and soul and effort put into it than the entirety of AAA titles of the last five years combined. It's not perfect, but my god is it fun. You will not find a more enjoying, addicting farming simulator. I have sunk hours and hours into this game and will continue to do so.

I could do a whole hour long video essay on why Stardew Valley is so awesome. But instead of listening to me, purchase it for what is a really great price, and get farming."
9445,its fun

9467,"great game, yay farming"
9468,"This is such a sweet game that gives you the freedom to play however you want. Wanna farm, mine, kill monsters, romance villagers, or sellout the whole town to a mega corporation? Go a head, there's no judgements in Stardew Valley. My only wish is that someday multilayer will be available on mobile."
9469,I love it

9472,"A well-made game - where there are all sorts of different game scenarios to explore. You can play this game indefinitely, but I have set a personal goal for what I want to achieve.

9481,"I have just 52 hours on my PC but hundreds on my Switch. I just wanted to finally switch to PC because my Switch Drift was so bad, and I wanted to play with mods some times. I just love this game. My favorite thing is achievement hunting and perfecting my farm layout for beauty and money making. I super look forward to ConcernApe's future projects!"

Developed by ConcernedApe
Published by ConcernedApe

In honour of my fiancé’s birthday, a review of something we enjoy play together.

Stardew Valley starts with the premise of a farming sim. Your character is burnt out on city life and moves to their grandfather’s old farm which they inherited. In theory, your job is to rebuild the farm and build your life in the community. In reality, there’s so much more than just watering and harvesting crops.

The first major sub-plot is the war between Joja Co and the small town. The corporation doesn’t give a shit about who they trample in their quest to make money (sound familiar?), and are perfectly happy to drive local general store owner Pierre out of business. They also care not one whit for the local environment. You have the choice between restoring the Community Centre and helping the town to thrive again, or buying a Joja Co membership and just focusing on making money.

Apart from making money with farming though, you have a lot of different options for how to spend your time in Stardew Valley. Want to go digging in the mines for rare ores and gems? Go for it. Want to combat monsters in the mines (or on your farm if you chose the right one)? Easy. Want to set up a winery on your farm and sell excellent booze? The locals will love it! How about going  fishing and catching all the available fish? Got you covered with a fishing mechanic which is far from the worst I’ve seen. And more: cooking, crafting, raising animals, befriending all of the villagers, getting married and having kids… so many options. There’s even a combined library and museum to fill up with artifacts found while digging, mining and fishing.

For a long time in farming sim type games with romance aspects, players could only be heterosexual. In this, pretty much everyone’s a bisexual disaster. Okay, not really, but it doesn’t matter what configuration of genitals is present in regards to relationships. The only thing that matters is whether a biological pregnancy can take place, or if you use an adoption agency. In addition, you select whether your character is male or female at the start of the game but can then make them look like whatever you please - whether that’s male, female, androgynous, or a duck-faced alien. Before the latest big update, there was even basic polyamory - you could date everyone and no one cared, but marrying meant that you had chosen that one partner. Unfortunately that has been changed and now it’s inadvisable to date everyone at once. Please ConcernedApe, let me have my bisexual polyamorous disasters back!

There is, of course, even more to the game than these basics.  I have over 750 hours spent in-game and I still haven’t explored everything. Even better, more is constantly being developed - and the game continues to update for free. This game is a true labour of love and is in turn loved by the community.

The graphics of Stardew Valley are very fitting. It’s a sweet style reminiscent of old-school Harvest Moon, but still unique. The music is also soft and beautiful, and lively when called for. I love everything about the aesthetic chosen for this game.


In all, I love Stardew Valley. It’s been a comfort game for years now, something that I will always return to. For single-player I prefer my PC version as there are some mods that I really love (is base-game vodka making too much to ask for?), but playing co-op via Switch is a bonding activity that I love. Our pets love it too - cuddle time with the whole family!

Top 5 Pros:
- Decent fishing mini-game
- Can be any sexual orientation (having no romance is a valid option)
- Many different viable playstyles
- High replayability
- Great split-screen co-op

Top 5 Cons:
- Combat is very basic
- Very little racial diversity
- Poly option was taken out
- Saving only once per day even in single-player (WHY do games do this???)
- Events happening every year can get very repetitive

Would I recommend?
Between my fiancé and I, we own at least 5 copies. Yes I recommend, on whatever platform you like best.

9601,Prepare not to touch grass i guess...
9602,I stole all of my friends tvs. 10/10 Detroit Simulator
9603,favorite game of all time.
9604,Great game. Get mods
9605,absolutely obsessed with this game
9606,"If Terraria and Animal Crossing had a love child, it would be this game. I can't stop playing for hours straight and I have no regrets."
9607,"too much time
"
9608,My favorite game ever; super calming and playable for many hours at a time. recommend!
9609,I own this game on various devices and have logged hundreds of hours into this game. It is relaxing and a great game to play either alone or with friends and the lack of pressure for marrying others makes it so much better! now I do wish there was more to it sometimes however I still continue to love this game.
9610,"stardew valley is a good relaxing game after a long day. i dont care much about the story, or anything like that, but if you're looking to buy it for relaxation purposes, its a great choice"
9611,chickens
9612,"blonde woman is mean to me, what else can a gal ask for <3, probably a guy who plays guitar, d&d, skateboards, and plays videogames... but the game has that as well. Wait a minute, this game is about farming??????"
9613,"yes
"
9614,"pretty good game, way better with friends"
9615,Very relaxing and well made. Full of diverse and interesting things to do without feeling overwhelming
9616,Great relaxing strategy/simulation/dungeon game. The quests sounded easy but this game has taken me a surprisingly long time to complete.
9617,"Very nice if you like a relaxed time with a soft tone of drama and romance. There are little things here and there that are a little irritating but not enough to prevent gameplay. It's an overall calm, lighthearted game with some other non lighthearted things. 10/10"
9618,"I love how you can do a lot of your own things in the game while also having structure, and it is lgbt+ friendly."
9619,really relaxable game
9620,This game is so wholesome! and tons of variety. I really like this game. Even when I only want to play for a bit.
9621,i cant stop playing plz someone send help i havent eaten in 2 days i must farm my turnips
9622,good
9623,"good game
"
9624,"My Favorite game ever!!!! I have 400+ hours on my switch, highly recommend!"
9625,"I absolutely love this game. I've been a huge fan of the harvest moon games but they've never really satisfied my craving, that is, until this game came along. The modding community is huge which has only added more to the game's replayability. Plus, [strike] stealing my friend's furniture (or placing a bunch of bears into their house) [/strike] fishing and farming with my friends has never been more fun. Absolutely amazing game."
9626,This game is supposed to be relaxing but it has turned me into a rampant capitalist that will over go any workplace restrictions to build my empire.
9627,Very fun!! Lots of fun choices and explorations + the pixel style is so cool
9628,vry fun
9629,Do I recommend this game? No. It is REQUIRED. I will force people to play this. I will strap them to a chair and make them watch gameplay like that one scene in a Clockwork Orange. I will hack into a billboard in times square and put this game up there. we need to go back to trading goods and farming and living like in this game. if not i will have to. INTERVENE.
9630,f a r m (and marry Abigail)
9631,godd game. adf gun
9632,"Only thing I wish is to have more interactions with spouse and kid after grown up and married. Besides for just kissing, like dates and family trips maybe."
9633,beacuse
9634,"Hmmm, yes.... collect shiny rock."
9635,I have over 65 hours in the switch edition of this game and am enjoying being able to run mods on it now. Its a great game to get lost in if you just want to pass time casually or really get into various aspects of the game that seemingly are never ending.
9636,is this harvestmoon ?
9637,c a l m
9638,"It's a very chill and fun game if you want to escape into the modern city life. The arts looks so amazing and the characters have their own cheery and quirky personalities. Be careful when you play the game, your perception of time will be gone once you start getting addicted."
9639,"SUCH FUN GAME FARM,ANIMALS,MARRY AND HAVE KIDS"
9640,Amazing and very addicting
9641,"Stardew Valley is entertaining and addictive on a level, mostly cause I love playing with my friends and having multiplayer adds such a rewarding setup especially for the relationships in game and competition between us for profession leveling."
9642,farm gam make pain go away
9643,"I freaking love Stardew Valley. I cannot get enough, I have a few different worlds and everytime i marry Sebastian because he is just perfect. It is so fun! My siblings enjoy watching me play it and it is pretty cheap. My dad bought it for me for Christmas because he saw how i enjoyed animal crossing, I was experiencing burnout for animal crossing so it was amazing and I'm so glad he did because it is amazing in every way. Def Recommend <3"
9644,pog game
9645,yea
9646,"A fun game to relax with on a rainy day, unwind with on a bad day, and definitely a winner for game night. I adore this game and the stories that have been sprinkled in between."
9647,"You can have a wife, live a happy life; I miss my children."
9648,much good
9649,good game
9650,This game is super fun and relaxing! The characters are cool to interact with and there are so many ways to play
9651,the cat go burrrrrrrrr
9652,GET IT
9653,good game great even.
9654,"Meh. I'm in the tiny minority here.

I played for over four hours but progression in this feels like a massive grind. I do a few things, run out of energy, then am forced to do nothing for the rest of the day and go to sleep. Feels like a big rinse and repeat cycle.

I can see why people would find this type of game appealing - I just don't. Maybe I'll give it another go soon.

p.s. for people that really enjoy this game - does it ever speed up? I understand it's not meant to be action packed but it does feel *really* slow currently. I'm 9 days in and no real sense of having progressed. You talk to the NPCs once, they have 1 or 2 sentences to say and then just walk off. I don't know, maybe I'm looking at it through the wrong lens.

Happy to change my review if I end up playing this again in the future."
9655,"this game slaps fr no cap
it gots cows and shit"
9656,"Her: are you far-right or far-left?

BITCH I'M FAR-MING"
9657,Everyday i give Alex a flower. the game gets a 10/10 just for him existing.
9658,BUY IT NOW IT IS THE BEST GAME
9659,"If you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed from the real world. Just dive into Pelican Town and you""ll forget all of your problems."
9660,"On the surface, Stardew Valley is a game about farming, but there are more adventures awaiting curious players beyond cultivating a rich and bountiful garden. From mining and fishing to making friends and falling in love, Stardew Valley's Pelican Town is stuffed with rewarding opportunities. As modern day woes give way to pressing matters on the farm and within your newfound community, Stardew Valley's meditative activities often lead to personal reflection in the real world. It’s a game that tugs at your curiousity as often as it does your heart.

Your journey begins in the field, cleaning up a neglected and rundown farm. Plotting and planning your garden requires care and attention to detail. What fruits and vegetables do you grow? How much room does each plant need? How do you protect your crops from nature's troublemakers? You learn through practice, and while the basics are easy to grasp, you quickly need to figure out the best way to outfit your budding farm with new tools and equipment.

Upgrades help speed up essential tasks like tilling the earth and watering your plants, but advanced equipment becomes a necessity when the time comes to break down large rocks and stumps that stick out in your garden. The crafting menu also entices you with optional time-saving tools; automated sprinklers that water the crops every morning, artisan equipment to make preserves or beer out of your harvest, and refineries, such as a furnace for turning ore into metal bars. If you want something, you can make it, you just have to scour your environment for the necessary components. As your farm improves, you gain the ability to raise livestock. Animals are expensive to buy and maintain, and the barn they live in isn’t cheap either. You start small, with a barn just big enough for a few chickens and ducks. But if you run an efficient and bountiful garden, you can eventually afford to upgrade to a bigger barn and keep hearty livestock like pigs, cows and sheep.

You have to feed your stock every day, which can get expensive, but they will eventually begin to produce eggs, milk and other rewards for all your hard work. Beyond their monetary value, animals are simply endearing to be around. Give them a name and work a little petting time into your routine; before you know it, your commodities have become your friends. Like your crops, the goodies livestock produce give you a sense of accomplishment, but their companionship is a different yet equally valuable reward.

When your farm is healthy and your equipment set, Stardew Valley opens up and your routine expands: after you water your plants, feed your animals and tidy up in the morning, you get to head out in search of adventure and friendship. There’s a mine north of Pelican Town with a seemingly endless bounty of buried treasure, but also danger. Combat is simple--a plain swipe of a sword will brush back most common monsters--but the dangers you face grow as you delve deeper into the mine, pushing your basic tactics to the limit.

There’s a risk/reward relationship to seeking out valuable treasure, as it becomes increasingly more difficult to defend yourself from procedurally generated creatures the deeper you go. You hit checkpoints--in the form of elevator stops--every few floors, which both encourages you to keep going and to return in the future in search of grander rewards as checkpoints allow you to skip past the mine's early levels. The precious gems you find can be sold for profit, donated to a museum that will conduct and share research, or simply hoarded in a chest to be fawned over down the road.

When you grow weary of toiling underground, you can also spend time fishing on lakes, streams and coastal beaches. Fishing in Stardew Valley is straightforward--you use one button to reel in a fish and let go when the line is tense--but it gives you a chance to soak in your surroundings and experience the joys of catching a wide array of fish unique to specific seasons and locations. It’s a calming experience at sunset after a long day that gives you a chance to reflect on your progress and daydream about adventures to come.

Stardew Valley constantly encourages you to explore, be it mining, foraging for fruit in the woods, or collecting seashells, and your curiosity is amply rewarded. Every hidden area you find, every train track you follow, leads to new sights and discoveries that add detail and color to the world around you. Yet as fulfilling as farming and exploring are, visiting Pelican Town's community center pulls you ever deeper into your new life. Like your farm at the beginning of the game, the community center needs a little attention at first: you’re sent out on fetch quests to gather the necessary materials to fuel its reconstruction.

Outside of the community center, the rest of Pelican Town's inhabitants also need your help. In working together to achieve small goals, you grow to understand your neighbors' personalities and identify what makes them tick. Some are pursuing their hopes and dreams, while others fight day to day to overcome personal obstacles; others are quirky creatures of habit that round out the community's overall identity.

Relationships are gauged by a heart meter, and getting to a certain number of hearts results in a cutscene that offer a closer look into your new friends' lives. Offering gifts and completing tasks from a board in the center of town are easy ways to increase your connections, and slowly but surely you’re allowed in the inner circle of people’s otherwise private lives. You may befriend a father named Kent who’s dealing trauma after years at war. He’s working on his temper and trying to bond with his child after being away from home. The child, whom you meet in hiding in his parent's basement, is quiet and introverted. But when you put the time in to get to know him, he reveals that he actually doesn't mind being alone, even though he believes that he's at odds with his parents. These personal moments are touching, and encourage you to spend more time getting to know the people around you.

And if you decide to enter Pelican Town's dating scene, don't be surprised if you end up with butterflies in your stomach. Giving your crush the right gift and seeing the joy on their face makes you genuinely happy, but you have to put yourself out there first. Sure, working with townsfolk in general is a good way to understand the ins and outs of potential suitors, but no amount of preparation diminishes the impact of anxiously delivering a heartfelt gesture. Because you've invested so much time and energy into forging relationships, you get nervous when you expose your feelings, regardless of the fact that you're courting a pixelated crush. Through strong writing and characterization, Stardew Valley stirs up surprising feelings: when your date shares his umbrella in the rain, you know he's the one.

9688,"I never thought a farming sim would be one of my favorite games of all time. It's the one game I would recommend to [b]anyone[/b].
Cannot recommend it enough."
9689,"The game feels like living another life way better than your real one. There is so much to do, you easily achieve a nice flow state and you'll find yourself spontaneously planning about stuff in the the game while not playing which only makes it more immersive. The NPCs feel like real people with their distinct characters and the town like a real only a more vivid and friendly place. I tend love drama and dark stuff in all media I consume and I thought it's not possible to make a pure feel-good game that is also interesting for me - Stardew Valley just proved me wrong. The only downside is that the awesome story just doesn't go on forever. (Or I'd be abandoning my real life for good which would not be healthy xD)

And it runs well on a potato like my PC."

9699,I have played this game on my xbox a while back and it was the best experience ive ever had with a game. Now on pc it is so much easier to do certain tasks. I really recommend this game to the people who would like to spend time and enjoy a game. This game made me want to do side quests.
9700,This game is so cozy and soothing. I love that I can mod out the mini game for fishing tho... that game really tanked my enjoyment of the vanilla game.
9701,"Não prometeu nada mas entregou tudoooo!!!
Quanto mais joga mais ele se demostra complexo nos detalhes."

If you see this game and are looking at reviews deciding whether or not to get it. I say get it, for sure worth the money. Will last you hours upon hours especially if you play in smaller sessions...though I wasn't able to, been playing the game all night and just got off to post this review lol. 1000/100"

9717,fun
9718,tis fun
9719,"A game full of farming, foraging, fishing, fighting, friendships, and much more. Stardew Valley is one of those few games that by day one you are sucked right into it.  There is NOTHING bad about this game at all.  Stardew Valley is a true masterpiece that is fun and addicting and will keep you playing for hours on end. 

"
9720,GET REJECTED BY FASHION SORORITY GIRL VERY FUN 10/10
9721,"played coop with gf. she gave me bread as a gift. i asked where it came from, she said from the trash can.

10/10 game"
9722,"This game is a lot of fun a absolute recommend from me, with plenty of things to do like fishing, mining, talking to the locals, chasing after your friends with a milk bucket, and local events in game you should never get bored of working your happy farm life, there are plenty of plants to grow and lots and lots of work to do like helping the junimos finish the town centre and unlocking everything in town through honest work and farmers pride! and an entire other island to explore  as well as 2 full mines full of dangerous monsters and baddies, you shouldn't get bored of this anytime soon because once your all done, its always good to take a break and do it all again.

- Yours truly, HueGho"
9723,"Such a relaxing little game, I absolutely love the small town feel, and that you can marry any of the NPCs available for marriage no matter what gender you pick for your character. Absolutely adorable game, and lots of fun to play with family and loved ones."
9724,This game makes you feel like a farmer. It also makes you feel like a citizen of a communist society when you share money 9/10
9725,"Amazing Game, totally would recommend. It works as a stress reliever for me, I think it will do the same for others. Slow paced sandbox game. It also has lots of secrets and fun things for players to discover. The community is also very Positive. I Highly recommend this for anyone who liked the original harvest moon."
9726,"It's cozy, fun and cute. If you need some chill-ass zombie brain time, this is great."
9727,fun
9728,"I absolutely hate that I have to write a negative review since its truly one of my favorite games of all time.

This is my second time purchasing the game because I wanted to play on PC with a friend. However, multiplayer is completely unplayable. It CONSTANTLY disconnects, sometimes seconds after joining. Multiplayer on switch works, but not on PC. Super dissapointing. We've tried every solution we could find online."
9729,It is fun
9730,High octane fishing action
9731,You won't regret it
9732,this game will forever be my comfort game
9733,"Still don't know where my time went, this game make you lose track of time, in a good way.
It's beautiful, a blissful break from this mad world.
Just go for it."
9734,i dont know remember when i first playing this
9735,"i sleep, therefore i wake"
9736,cute
9737,"If you're big on chill, relaxing games; this is for you. Albeit not as many as some, but I currently have 64 hours  in the game and there's still a lot I haven't completed (I would say about 50 hours on my current save). It keeps you engaged. Granted, I'm not a min/max player, so I'm a little slower then some. However with the mix of story and open play, I can safely say this is my favorite game. Also, fun multiplayer options :)"
9738,"sooooooooooo good
"
9739,fun
9740,very solid :)))))
9741,good yes yes.
9742,"As a Lesbian, this has made all my dreams of having a girlfriend and a farm come true. Now I just need to get a real girlfriend so I can play this with her!
......
That aside, the game is extremely fun, you get to plant crops, fight monsters in the mines, become friends with the villagers, AND you get visited by you dead grandfather. The game is simple and not overly complex. And I love that about it. If you like simple farming games, then you'll 100% love this game!"
9743,very chill
9744,"My best friend described this game as 'cosy', and I couldn't agree more. It is so wholesome and lovely. The soundtrack is almost my favourite thing about it, as it matches the seasons and gets even better in the mines, which houses my equal favourite gaming music.

It somehow doesn't make you feel like you need to progress in game; you could try to mine as quickly as possible, own animals as quickly as possible or make the most amount of money as quickly as possible... but if you wanted to you could just take whatever time you have and have your own bubble of joy and beauty. You also don't feel as though you're missing out by choosing different dialogue options or career paths. It's one of the very few games I've played that I've somehow become really immersed and have just focussed on what I've wanted to focus on, without doing tedious daily tasks or risk missing out on rewards. 

The 1.5 Update added so much content and QOL changes, I feel like I've only started, but am living my best life whenever I turn the game on. It is an absolute delight. 10/10"
9745,Worth every penny and second
9746,good
9747,Farming
9748,I love this game so so much it's just so amazinf I love <333 all of the marriage candidates so much the fact that I can only marry one at a time makes me sad. if only the polyamory mod wasn't so broken :(. It is so fun I have so mmany npc friends  frick joja co.!!
9749,I LOVE BALLS
9750,literally addicted!
9751,"If you want something relaxing but with loads of lore and backstory, this is the game for you. There is always something to do!!"
9752,"I've been playing it so much in the past month I had it, I genuenly forget what season it is sometimes."
9753,Solid game. Modding is pretty fun.
9754,Perfect ^_^ Relaxing and very addicting.
9755,relaxing and great aesthetic
9756,Farm
9757,Too good to be true
9758,YES
9759,Make big money go bigg
9760,"Devs keep removing money cheats and the grinding is incredibly boring and unrewarding. It's fun if you have a ton of money but now that I can't bypass the first three or so in-game years of grinding money to get what I actually want to play with, I get bored after about 20 days in a new save file and quit the game. Difficult and annoying to cheat, every time you find a good method it's removed, and not balanced enough with income to make it worth replaying if you don't have time to burn harvesting and watering parsnips for 6 hours a day irl. Great for players who have no job, but if you want to make progress and do have things to do, you're going to need to take PTO to get it since the devs don't seem to want you to enjoy the game too. 

The vibe is lovely, but it's extremely boring being unable to do anything but plant and water for months upon months upon months in game with no escape or choice to just skip that. Best part of the game was the golden pumpkin cheat, and then everything after that (no longer possible, don't bother.)"
9761,One of the greatest time of our time.
9762,good game very addictive
9763,STARDEW IS BUSSIN
9764,kinda average
9765,I can't get helf of the demands to work.  Very challenging.  A lot of work
9766,How do i grow drugs
9767,"This game accessed your (unchangeable) steam ID, this game keeps deadnaming me every time I join :/"
9768,"pretty pog, i  like chickens"
9769,"It is a good game. Slow at first, I am just casual gamer and I felt like I was wasting my time because the character didn't have a lot of energy, did not run fast enough. It is still the case but something change, I still have the same problem with how slow everything is but I'm OK with that now. Something change and you feel one whit the game. 
"
9770,this game is very addicting
9771,"Amazing game with a lot to do, Hope ya'll have as much fun as I had!"
9772,this game forced me not to go to work. would recommend 10/10
9773,it is a lovely game
9774,This game is one of the best just kickback and chill kinda games. There is a ton things to discover and some deep lore. Seriously extremely relaxing. But be warned....it is a time vortex.
9775,"After countless hours of grinding competitive games, Stardew Valley was a nice change of pace. During my few hours of playtime, I enjoyed farming, fishing, and bettering our hometown. ConcernedApe does a great job at making an environment where you can relax and experience the small town setting that is Stardew Valley. From connections with the characters to raising your crops, this game is extremely relaxing."
9776,"What a great game, this is full of details and good ideas. You can play and replay and still find new stuff all the time."
9777,"Not for me, i dont like the slow paced boring gameplay"
9778,Multiplayer sucks ass but good game
9779,good

9787,<3
9788,"I absolutely love this game! In general, im not a huge fan of simulator games or farming games, but Stardew Valley fully won me over. Behind Minecraft, SDV is my second most played game of all time. I love the characters, the graphics are cute, and there's so much to do. And hey, you got bored of the base game? The modding community is alive and kicking! You can change the game so much that. with only a few mods, you can add hours and hours worth of game time. I fully recommend SDV for anyone who's considering it. (and you don't have to wait till its on sale, its worth it at $15!)"
9789,the first time playing turned into 11 hours. This Game Deletes your life. it's really hard to pull away from the game.
9790,Playing with girl friend. Much fun. Much farm. Much memory. 10/10
9791,I love this game :)
9792,"love this game, one of my favorites"
9793,BETTER THAN I COULD EVER IMAGINE
9794,"After devoting 680 hours to Animal Crossing: New Horizons, I was a little anxious to pick up Stardew Valley and see how the two would compare. Once I purchased Stardew, I couldn't put it down for 2 weeks straight. I can confidently say that both games serve their own unique purpose and are both worthy of playing for different reasons.

Your life in Stardew will quickly develop as you plant more crops, build more farm buildings, upgrade your tools, and become more friendly with the townspeople. The game gives the player clear objectives and rewards in a somewhat predictable (like the time it takes to turn milk into cheese) but satisfying (end of the day sales numbers) way. There's only so much time in a day however, and as you unlock more of your game, you'll start to maximize the hours in your day to fill it with harvesting, gifting, and exploring outside the valley. The changing seasons and special events keep the player engaged and there are SO many secrets across the game to be uncovered. The soundtrack is absolutely perfect and pairs wonderfully with the charming pixel art design of the valley and its characters.

Every single part of this game was developed by ONE MAN which makes every detail even more impressive and he deserves every sale. Do not think of pirating this game because I will find you. Even if this game was $50, it would still be worth it. I play Animal Crossing when I want to chill in real time talking to cute animals and arranging furniture in a house. I play Stardew Valley when I want to grind, harvesting on the farm in the morning, foraging in the forest, desert or island during the day, and decompressing with the townspeople at the local pub at night. For anyone who enjoys sim/ farming games-- no, even if you DON'T like them, this one is 100% worth a buy and deserves a spot in your library stat!"
9795,is very good
9796,i like the game a whole lot but haley is a bitch
9797,Very nice 👍
9798,Farming
9799,this game is great! i've been addicted to it
9800,i fycjcicg LOVE THID GAME its the only thingive done for luike two days I LOVE THIS GAME ITS SOOOO GOOD I HAVE NOT HAD A SINGUKLAR THOUGHT IN SOOOO LONG . VERY REFRESHING AND YSLAY
9801,"Had a couple hundred hours on the Switch version, and decided to get the Steam version to play with a couple friends of mine, a decision I would not regret. 
It was fun as hell to just boot up Stardew Valley every now and then and just fuck around with friends, planning out specific things, like having one person tend to crops and dealing with debris on the farm, while the other is off fishing, in order to maximize profit, while also trying to gather everything for the Community Center as quick as possible. 
Even without friends to play Stardew Valley with, the game has a lot to do when playing solo. For one, the plot is thicker than Boston's North end on Jan. 15th 1919. Every Character has a plethora of interactions that take place after bonding a large amount with said Character, which is done by gifting specific items to specific NPCs, said information can be uncovered by interacting with specific things, like digging through dirt and finding a missing book, speaking to other NPCs, or through literally just playing the game. (No seriously, your bound to run into TONS of stuff, no matter what you're doing, or where.)
And if you're not too into becoming deeply immersed in the story, the game-play is great too. There's a ton of stuff to do like mining, smelting, fishing, tending to crops, taking care of animals, crafting items to make specific tasks easier, or if you're like me, spending absurd amounts of time making ludicrous amounts of crab traps to get unreasonable amounts of snails.
I would ABSOLUTELY recommend Stardew Valley, it's an overall incredible experience, with large amounts of things to do, it's stupid fun to play when I have spare time.

TL;DR When bored, I boot up funny farming game, because it's fun."
9802,stink
9803,"THIS GAME IS SO GOOD
Stardew Valley is a great game and I would greatly reccomend it but it is also much better with mods"
9804,Stardew
9805,"Good game, lots of fun mods
"
9806,"If you like farming, and having your own space. You'll like this game. Actually, if you like good games, you'll like this game."
9807,Dis a good game.
9808,this is good but i still don't know how to move
9809,I'm in Stardew Valley phase right now :)
9810,"Stardew Valley is a really good Game. It's Filled with so much good content. I have 60 hours in the game and I am not even close to finishing the game. Either because there is so much content or I am slow but whatever. Even if the base game starts to Get a little boring (as if), There are so many mods that basically make the game like new again."
9811,this game appeals to my fantasy of having income.
9812,"I personally play this when I need to relax and chill, and it helps a lot when you're mad at another game. You can also play with friends which is also a very fun experience."
9813,"Cute ass game, which so much stuff to do constantly it's hard to get bored. Wasted good amount of my life on this game on both steam and switch. I will be the master of the world"

9817,i love playing this game. if you are thing of getting it GET IT.
9818,"Super fun, relaxing game. There's always something to do. Expect some grinding, but the features include farming, mining, crafting, and romancing [ the last one is optional, but to get all the achievements in the game, you need to get married and have two kids...but you could always turn the kids into doves and then divorce your heartbroken partner once you unlock that...if you were a monster ;) ]"
9819,LOVE
9820,i pley with mods
9821,"ill never get the chance to live a truly free life because of the elites but i can at least play this game. i was gunna have kids, but instead i can do it here. that way none of my line has to do in the climate apocalypse. no climate apocalypse in stardew valley, no sir. my wife loves me. i have a wife because in this game i can form healthy relationships. yup. its a great time down in the valley, ill tell you hwat."
9822,It's getting late...
9823,Chill out doing farming stuff at your own pace. Wanna be a rancher? Be a rancher. Want to be a farmer? Be a farmer.
9824,"Great game to calm you down after playing intense comp games, very nice"
9825,Very good
9826,"Yeah, uh this game is pretty good (just look at my play time)"
9827,"This is an amazing game all around. Controller support on Mac OS is terrible, so if that is your lane I wouldn't bother, but other than that I could not recommend this game more."

9842,generally a fun game. 1000 things to do on any given day. 100% worth it.

9851,"Good game,  will definitely play it again"
9852,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
9853,im dating shane
9854,"It's so pretty and charming. Easy to play and understand, but not boring at all, since there's always so much to do. A game that can be played in any way you want. It's a work of love and you can see it in countless details. Every single day spent in my farm makes me feel so good. I just love it :)"
9855,played this game for quite a while now :) i find it extremely worth the buy. if you get bored of the base game (you really wont) you can mod it to endless extents. awesome game!

9862,"stardew has always been a safe space for me. its relaxing and cozy and enjoyable. but it can also keep you focused. you have tasks to complete. things to do. chores to accomplish. its something ive gotten my (non-gamer) gf into and by now, i think she has more hours put in. the one thing i would say is that multiplayer is just really not where it needs to be yet."
9863,one of the best games ive ever played.

9878,yes
9879,You can tell this is a passion project as the amount of dedication that has been put into this game is incredible. Definitely worth every penny as there are hundreds of hours of game to be explored.
9880,"This game is a spiritual successor to games like Harvest Moon (which is where I believe the game found it's main inspiration) and Rune Factory. If like me you enjoyed playing such games and are looking for a similarly charming experience, then this will suit you perfectly."
9881,i've been playing for 3 hours and it's already been 29 hours
9882,Best farm simulation game I've ever played. It's like if Minecraft was less pixelated and more task-oriented.
9883,good but when you get mods it go crazy. keep that in mind. ok?
9884,"If I could describe this game I would describe it as an anomaly. I am the type of person to just play a game for like 20 hours and then get bored and buy another game because I already figured out how to do everything, but this game just constantly has me thinking. I don't have a single game over 153 hours and I think I am going to play this for 1000 hours. Great game, very unique, and just all around one of the best games out there."
9885,"To start off I have played way more than 32 hours but for some reason my original save where my character was married and rich got deleted and steam no longer had the hours from it. I'm entirely serious and super sad about it because I'm not tech savvy enough to go to my files and fix it. THAT BEING SAID THOUGH!!! I love stardew valley as a game and though my account doesn't show it anymore i played it a lot. It's fun and has elements to it almost any person can enjoy! Mining, farming, dating, it really calls out to a lot of people. Aside from that one incident it really is a great game."

9928,"Personally, I love open world games and Stardew Valley does this perfectly! You can spend all your time on the farm, in the town, anywhere really. Although I have had some problems with how the game runs on my setup, the game is unique, full of fun details, and absolutely beautiful."

9937,Very good and relaxing game
9938,great game 10/10
9939,"This game is the perfect game for people who want a low key, wholesome farming simulator. The additional quests and storylines add to the experience and I absolutely love it!"
9940,noice game :D
9941,GG
9942,better than the original
9943,Nice game but sadly I have no time to play
9944,Meditative
9945,"One of the most wholesome games I've played in a while - I started Stardew after being an avid Animal Crossing NH player and was hoping for something with more depth and personality to the game. While I still love ACNH for what it is, I've found Stardew to be more enjoyable. 10/10 would recommend"
9946,"yes

9947,"Its a very fun game, when you are not in winter year 1."

9949,SO GOOD FARM GAME
9950,"Virtually unplayable since it always disconnects when on multiplayer mode. You'd expect that after years of it being available, this would have long been patched. And to think the dev is too busy making a new game now. Ridiculous."
9951,i hate stardew valley [spoiler] (lovingly) [/spoiler]
9952,"i didnt expect to be so stressed over if my melons would grow and why my cows arent lactating but here we are.
10/10 game, i bought it this weekend and i already have almost 18 hours on record its so good

9953,"Terraria but for grandparents or people who are living at a snail's pace

(Personally i would enjoy it more if i wouldn't have to wait so long for crops to grow and develop and race against time of in-game day and stamina. GOD I HATE THE STAMINA.)"
9954,<@3
9955,yah
9956,a game you can sink hours upon hours into. i've already played for 40+ hours and there's still so much more to do and explore. highly recommend if you're looking for something chill <3
9957,"amazing game, such an enjoyable experience. it's better than most AAA games of the same nature and a quarter of the price, what's to lose?"
9958,"Stardew Valley is a farming sim game, which means it's a harvest moon-esque game. Yet I had more fun playing this game than when i was playing any harvest moon game. I honestly got addicted for the first in-game year and still have stuffs to do after that.
Simply put, great game, would recommend and 10 out of 10 will dive into gaming coma again."
9959,"i want a divorce but got no money

I GOT A DIVORCE"

9963,10/10 Shmeckles!
9964,"I mean, it's Stardew Valley. If you haven't heard about it by now, I'm not sure that reading my review is gonna be your first information about this glorious game. 

It's escapism for millenials. We'll never actually own anything or be in control of our food destiny, so we play Stardew Valley instead. 

10/10"
9965,love this game. it has the cutest graphics and is endlessly entertaining - its very easy to get lost in this game for hours <3
9966,"Have not been this addicted to a game in a while, you think you'll spend a few minutes or maybe an hour or 2? No no no my friends, YOU SPEND THE ENTIRE WEEK playing this game. You forget to do things in the real world cause you're over here force feeding Leah 2 salads a week or helping Shane and Pam with their alcohol addiction by being a supplier for them.

Overall a fun game IMO"
9967,The most heartwarming game I have ever played. Helped me through the past few year immensely! Would recommend to absolutely anyone.
9968,good game

<3 stardew valaaaaaaaaaaaaaay"
9983,Super addictive
9984,"Ridiculously good fun at an incredibly low price. Works perfectly with a controller (although, it would be nice to have a guide to the buttons).

But why aren't there olive tree saplings (press olives for oil), sugarcane or sugarbeet plants (process for sugar), unidirectional sprinklers with increased range over the regular omnidirectional versions, and better chances for getting mixed seeds?"
9985,i really enjoyed this game while playing it i recomend it to anyone wanting a stress free game
9986,this game is fat poggers
9987,"Stardew Valley is a game that will live in my heart for eternity. Even years after I stop playing it. 
In this game there is truly something for everyone. There's aspects of romance, farming, grinding, puzzle, adventure, combat, and some of the most immaculate storytelling I've ever seen in a game. The character development in this game is better than many movies I've seen. It's simple and relaxing for those who want a calm and peaceful experience but challenging and angering for those who haven't touched grass in ages. On the topic of non-grass touchers, you can experience talking to a woman for the first time. 
When I bought this game I expected a simple farming experience. I usually love fast paced challenges, but I began playing this as a break, or a getaway. It began as just that. However, especially in the newest (1.5) update, there's more frustrating and mind-wrinkling minigames. Despite this, if you want a simpler time, you could spend time with your spouse or your children. Maybe go around and talk to people. Give gifts, forage for fruits, dive into the mines, etc. 
There's different styles of playing. Decorate your farm, befriend the town, produce artisan goods such as wine, cheese, and jelly, etc. The game gives you two different options for early-middle game progression. Bring the town together by giving mysterious creatures various items that they request, with the end goal of repairing various necessities such as a bridge to a quarry, a bus to a desert, or the big prize, a community center for the town. Or you could side with the mighty corporations, and turn the wrecked community center into a warehouse, and pay money in order to repair the earlier mentioned bus and bridge.
Various events, many of which play off on real world holidays, bring the town together and introduce exclusive shops and minigames for the character.
Maybe you could bring the real family together in a co-op farm.
If I haven't convinced you, you can download mods that heavily expand the game. Maybe you can increase the quality of living with automation or tractors.
All of this resulting in what will likely remain for a long time as my favorite game. All made by one man. So, please, I usually don't just blatantly ask this, but buy this game. Support the creator and all of his current and future endeavors. Believe me, you will not regret it."
9988,"A simple, chilling farming game with a good story plot that is full of character development. There are also other activities besides farming, such as foraging, fishing, mining, crafting, cooking. The weather system is lively. It's a fun process trying to get to know the people of the village."
9989,animal crossing but its a farm
9990,"Its old now, but that lends it a simplicity that makes it good fun :)"
9991,i loved how it has lore that you generally don't need to know.It really is such a wonderful game.
9992,it has fishing 10/10
9993,very cute and fun
9994,so cute
9995,yes
9996,"SLAY

10001,broke 3 of my mouses but penny is cute so its worth it
10002,yes
10003,:D
10004,"I honestly thought this was a childish game until I got playing with some online friends. I was thinking Nintendo farm game, which I am not into, I am more of a racing/off-road gamer, but this game is SOOOO relaxing, I mean, if you got nothing to do you just go fish. Could you want more? Well, there is a bar, you can get buzzed on coffee or booze, your choice.

In the end, I think that this game actually blended enough content to keep adults entertained, like dating, trying to get married, having a family and just wanting to make as much cash as possible. 

The single player game is a grind, I mean a grind! With three ppl we've made it to yr 2 have so much stuff on the farm, and its growing each time we log on. 

Issues: random disconnection when in multiplayer, weird transition lines when walking around, v-sync, graphics all where they should be, nothing I have found fixes the issue."
10005,"There are multiple different goals provided by the game, or you can set goals for yourself. There's no set ending, or ""true ending,"" which makes Stardew Valley excellent for long term play. There is a plethora of variables that will change the game experience, so you can play over and over again to explore different options."
10006,twas good.
10007,"A charming and stunningly detailed farming game with a terrific soundtrack, diverse game aspects, and complex social interactions. Concerned Ape poured so much creative work into this game! I always have at least one play-through going at all times."
10008,n b
10009,"Super cute, super fun game. There's simple game play, but enough secrets and tasks to keep you going, super fun in co-op too."
10010,Very fun
10011,Amazingly chill game!
10012,"This game is super chill, you can take it at your own pace, I was recommended playing this game by my friend, and I have loved it since. I can't think of more of a chill game than this one."
10013,fun :)
10014,bruh
10015,Penny is best waifu
10016,chill af no stress
10017,"At first, I thought it would be boring because of the repetitive schedule like always needing to water your plants everyday and maintaining your farm, but it was actually more than just an indie farming game. You have interesting interactions with the many characters in game, each having their own backstories and schedules. It also taught me a lot of things I wouldn't have cared about if it wasn't for Stardew Valley. I really recommend this game to anyone who wants a good open-ended indie game which revolves around the country life."
10018,not bad
10019,"Stardew is a spectacular little gem of wholesome fun.
You can play for 30min or sink endless days into this beauty.
Have re-started my farm more times than I can count, and it's still as fun as ever.
Just play it, you'll love it."
10020,I love farming games and this was a wonderful game that has  SO many hours of content.
10021,"very fun to play with others!

10024,"A Game you can Turn on to ""Turn off"" to.
Simple Game, Simple graphics. Always something to do."
10025,got to marry the old man of my dreams
10026,"This is my favorite game and is the only one I've ever bought twice. For a while, I only had the Switch version. However, once I started seeing more and more about mods and watching videos, I made a Steam account specifically to buy and play this game. No regrets (except for my destroyed time management as I now spend all my time playing this game)."
10027,keeps kicking me out
10028,SILLY
10029,great game
10030,I would kill my mom for this game

10035,"Incredibly comfy and detailed little indie game, absolutely love it"
10036,This game is very fun it is about farming and raising animals also you can grow crops and there is a lot more to this game but is is all related to farming!!
10037,one of the top 5 farming game of all time 9.5/10 (the point .5 is because its in 2d)
10038,"420/69, best game ever, absolutely flawless, lore actually makes sense, gameplay can be slow-paced and relaxing or action-packed, depending on your preference, contains everything I could possibly want in a game. Would recommend over literally any game in existence, ever."

10047,Very relaxing and great for people who just want a chill game to kick back and play without a lot of hassle. I love being able to play this with my best friend who lives on the other coast and its a great way to bond even further!
10048,Very fun game overall. Every time I start to get mildly bored I find some new path to begin and get hooked into it again.
10049,"Don't get this game. It's Stupid addictive. Your life, your career, your common sense will be over before you know it. Before long you'll fall asleep drooling at your desk, while daydreaming about your angry and depressed Alcoholic Husbando who's actually a really big softy when you get to know him, then you do that communal stuff with your friends, and end up fishing like your life, and their lives depend on it. AND THEN you'll find yourself investing in a swanky notebook to write down  a play-by-play plan on how to successfully do a Stardew Farm with your friends. And different ideas you can do for it. As well as all of the potentially splendid ways you can sh!tpost them while playing. This of course is just before you start side-eyeing them for giving your Spouse of Choice a birthday gift... like.. tf, Sarah, get your own man. Leave my sulky alcoholic pixelated boyfriend alone. .... bish.  Next thing you know, all you do is eat, sleep, breathe and ... complete a full digestive cycle of Stardew Valley. Do not get this game."
10050,a very relaxing game to unwind to.

10052,deez
10053,Goated. own two copies
10054,"I love this game, but only for multiplayer. When attempting to mod, I had major issues and it resulted in me loosing the ability to mod altogether. If you enjoy modding, do not download this game unless you are prepared for a difficult time."
10055,"A mix of minecraft and animal crossing, some of the best games ever. Please get this game!! No regerts!"
10056,Is good
10057,Fun game with friends.

10064,"it's literally just the best game ever, like, no words can describe how charming this game is."
10065,"With 363 hours on record, yeah...I think I can say this game is amazing. It's so relaxing (aside from fishing, that's an absolute nightmare), meeting everyone and interacting and learning the secrets behind all the villagers and the town, plus exploring new areas. Stardew Valley is an amazing game made by an amazing developer, and I can't wait for Haunted Chocolatier to continue the journey of my little farmer/chocolatier!"

10073,"I love this game but theres a glitch that keeps happening almost every time I play. I will log on, play for a while and go from like winter year 1 to summer year 2. I make a ton of progress, get married, etc, and then save the game and close it out after its fully saved. Then, I log on the next day, and it brought me all the way back to winter. All my progress disappeared, all the stuff I got is gone, and I'm no longer married. I don't understand why this is happening, it just is. Aside from that I love the game so much."
10074,"Çok iyi oyun her dakikadan keyif alıyorsunuz oynarken, hiç sıkmıyor. Başından kalkmak istemiyorsunuz oynarken."
10075,"If you are looking for a game that you can jump into and play casually, but also a game where you can get incredibly deep and competitive with this game is for you. Some days i'm in the mood for a relaxing game of Stardew, just playing around with a little world. Other days I want to MinMax the entire experience. Making it all as efficient as possible and accomplishing my goals as fast as possible."
10076,"I love how diverse stardew valley is! the characters, their back stories.. its all so immersive! Its like if Minecraft, farm ville, and anaiml crossing all had a cross over, this is the game!"

10108,"I have never heard of Stardew Valley before but it had suddenly gotten really big when it had an update after not having one for several years, and it was cheap so of course I had to check it out. I didn’t think I was going to like it because it was very pixilated and I was used to more 2D games, but it was a farming RPG so I wanted to give it a shot and I have to say that I loved it. It’s so simple in design and you can’t really see the details in your character, but it didn’t bother me after a while. I spent most of my first year just figuring things out because there are no instructions. It really immerses you in what is actually happening because when you get to a farm, do you automatically know what to do? No. And that is what the whole experience is for. To put you in the shoes of your character. So I really had to find things out as I went and it got easier the further along I got."
10109,Very chill game to play with or without your friends.

10115,"7/10
Kinda boring; that's good though.
No time limit is a plus.
Not a lot to do: I find myself getting into a rut after 20 mins and already want to get off.
Love the timeless pixel art."

10154,I can't believe how many hours I've spent rinsing this game. Me and my partner have been hammering it on the split screen co-op - it'd ace how we can both do our own thing but also work as a team when we feel like it.

10184,"Bought it, then gifted it, 3 times, then bought it again for my switch. 
This game is phenomenal, and the ONE GUY behind Concerned Ape understands how game time and game play more than... pretty much any size company these days. UI is simple, works the way you want. NPC have more charisma than most modern AAA games. Great BGM. From ultra casual friendly to modders approachable. 
So many silly little things like multiple screen friendly (not the game itself but interaction with)
Every aspects and mechanics doesn't feel shallow, thoughts and time went into them or at least it feels that way. The game is also getting free updates regularly, which are absolutely fantastic every time.
Thanks you for the GEM of a game."

10186,"This game is very addicting. The storyline is very interactive despite being set. It's along the same line as animal crossing with the amount of ""busy work"" but it's very fun and relaxing."
10187,"Great game, Better Co-Op, and of course there's the Dating Sim.
Played waaaaay more hours then my Steam gives me credit for.

Obv I married Abigail. I mean, I sell things to the store. Her Dad owns the store. He dies, we own the town. Boom. Farming.

Make babes, make scarecrows, make money.

Sunrise, Sunset."
10188,"this game is a hidden gem, the fact that one person made this is insane, 38 hours in still seeing new stuff everyday. Totally recommend if you like a chill and a game to burn through time."

10199,"heres my review on the game, its fun, time killer, lots of things to do and accomplish.

this game is most likely worth buying if you are into farming/exploring/socializing/combat/etc.
knowing that this is all made by 1 person, concernedape. the gameplay/music/dialogues are absolutely fun.

game rating: 10/10 (sometimes you can get softlocked on a scene but its fine because the game saves when you sleep)




[strike] also can i feed my pet, im starting to think that water is my pets whole meal everyday. or because it is... oh no [/strike]"
10200,"I am not a 13 yo father, probably one of the stupidest people playing this game. I am not a single father to my Son, who is 0 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 1942 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son. So i decided to steal a son's Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my son for help and he said I should kill myself because I write these dumbass reviews under every game."
10201,"Awesome
"
10202,This game has consumed my entire life and I'm alright with that

10207,really good game about farming
10208,"Absolutely stunning game. Even after achieving perfection and getting some of the hardest achievements. i still want to play more. 

Gorgeous art style
Lovely characters
Solid Mechanics (even if combat falls a little flat at times)
Calming atmosphere that you can lose yourself for hours in.

All around. Yes. This game is incredible and if you have any doubts, trust me you will love it"
10209,"Ive played around two thousand hours of minecraft, and in the end of the day. I'd always want to have a slow pace game like Stardew Valley."

10212,this a game you'd play after school when you'd want to relax and not think about your grades all in all good game
10213,Easy to drop into; not difficult. Simple and easy going. A nice joyful bliss of a balance ingame.
10214,One of the best game I have played. Never regretted on buying this game. A chill game.
10215,good game but if only they can add WASD to navigating the menu so i don't have to use my mouse
10216,Relaxing game with so many hidden secrets. Cant get enough
10217,maturing is realising that mayor lewis is the villain of pelican town
10218,damn good cross game type
10219,very good a witch gave me a void egg
10220,"I was on the fence about this game because I wasn't sure that I would like the simple, chill, animal-crossing like game. but I have spent almost 50 hours on it so far and it hasn't even been that long since I got it. I cannot put this game down. I see stardew valley in my dreams. It's not as simple as wow cute farm, but the characters are great and I reallly enjoy seeing my own progress in the game. Its fulfilling actually being able to see the results of my hard work. Play this game. I feel that there is something in this game for everyone."
10221,there is more to do then i tought. it just gets better and better :D
10222,trash

The systems are intuitive and not frustrating, you have plenty of freedom while still having some gentle guidelines and a concrete time system. The writing is charming, the music is fantastic.

10245,yes.
10246,yay
10247,"I'm now madly in love with Sam, thank you"
10248,"This game is what you spect from a farm game.

Crops, animals, crafting, minning, woodworking, fishing, etc.
It has relationships, and u can even get maried and divorce.

Tons of items, places to visit, things to do... Damn, it has it all.

The only issue is the movement speed... is so fkng slow for all the things u have and can do.

At the end. is fun as hell, so yeah, get it whenever you can."
10249,My mom has 200 hours in this game
10250,"First played this game on the family Switch, and was instantly hooked! I've always been a sucker for calm farming games, so this game was right up my alley. I got it on my phone, and later on my PC!"
10251,i played mostly offline so my hours dont count up so i dont look like degenerate for having over 100 hours in 2 weeks
10252,"I love this game, i love grinding on the caves, i love killing slimes, its a good game, id recommend if you like grindy stuff, you can marry in this game :O.

play it with 1 or two friends and its even better!"
10253,I've played 100+ hours and would recommend you get stardew valley if you just want to have fun and relax
10254,"It's on par with Battlestate Games' ""Escape from Tarkov"" title.

If you've ever seen it, or played it yourself, you're used to the adrenaline and fast-paced game-play. You're used to doing a thousand calculations a second to figure out velocities, isthmuses, wind speeds and the curvature of the Earth.

You have been painstakingly doing quests and bartering with others in your community in order to raise your reputation and reap more rewards. 

Take all of that and turn it up to eleven.

Welcome to Stardew Valley."
10255,"Calm, very nice"
10256,If i can't get a gf irl I can at least get a gf here
10257,"This is the best game ever you can farm, get wives or husbands and you can get like as many partners as you would like. You can also get cute animals and fish and basically just farm. you can also decorate your house. If that wasn't enough you can go mine and there are even certain festivals doing the year where you can play games and earn special items for your farm. So yes i did play for 8.4 hours but now you know why."
10258,"If you're looking for single-player game that you can play at your own pace, this is the one. I'm a big fan of sim games and this scratches that itch while being so much more than just a city or village builder. You get to design your home and surrounding area however you please, while forming relationships with the people in town and uncovering secrets and much more all around. There's a lot to discover and the developer clearly cares about his fans and works tirelessly to keep the game updated and put some new things in every once in a while. Can't recommend this game highly enough."
10259,good soup
10260,CHILL
10261,"One of the best games I've ever played in my life. The story and relationships feel so authentic and touching, and the way you explore and interact with the world is so appealing and intriguing."

10295,dope game. Elliott and Sebby are manwife material :3
10296,Easily one of the best time wasters out there.  Fun and light hearted.  Okay for anyone of any age.  Enough to keep you going.
10297,Love the game and the mods have made this 4th play through such a new experience.
10298,I really enjoyed playing this game until it stopped working for me. After trying the troubleshooting instructions given on steam I reached out the the Stardew Valley customer support team through email and was never even given a response. I haven't been able to play this game in about a year. I've sent two emails months in between and no response. While this is a really fun game the customer service is HORRIBLE so I can't cant recommend it. I'm just going to count it as a lost and uninstall it.
10299,"Caroline, Robin and Jodi best milfs"

10316,"It's so much fun, a lot of freedom, romance is a lot of fun, and the mods are fantastic! I only wish we could have a darker more slaughterhouse option, but i understand this game is very light hearted and lovely. I love the cooking!! I can't wait to add more exotic creatures to the farm!"
10317,good

Just like in real life."

10324,"Been playing this game for years and always seem to come back to it every few months.  Recently, I've gotten the final steam achievement, but I think I'll still be playing this for years to come.  If the game ever begins to feel repetitive for you, the modding community is amazing and has vast expansions the complement the game perfectly."

10329,good game.
10330,Stardew Valley is everything that makes games addictive condensed into one package. And it's great
10331,"Stardew Valley deserves every single bit of praise it has ever received over the years. The ability to add expansive mods from the community that adores it only enhances later experiences. Currently I am on my third play through, already 100 hours in, and I'm STILL chugging along."
10332,good
10333,"Wonderful experience. I always come back after a break and fall in love with it all over again

10418,Play this game.
10419,"So I had some trouble finding the right words to discribe how amazing this game is - so I looked up all the negative reviews:

1. ""you can't marry the homless dude""
2. ""I can't date the moms""
3. ""I know we all came to see who are the people and what reasons they have to dislike this game, dont worry just buy it.""
4. ""stop searching for a negative review and buy the game""

Well, I guess those reviews speak for themselves - buy the game!"
10420,
10421,good ass game
10422,good
10423,i have a girlfriend (in game).
10424,"Stardew Valley isn't just a basic farm game. This game is a masterpiece. Stop the prejudice and at least, try. it's worth the price twice."
10425,Its stress free
10426,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
10427,Playing this to relax after Elden Ring
10428,"This game has caused me to change my entire outlook on life. I am going to be a farmer, and marry a magic crystal girl."

10446,"Honestly, I am surprised at how popular this game is.. It just feels like a bunch of busy-work, and I hate the energy and required sleep system. It's definitely NOT bad, but it feels like ""daily quests the game"". It just isn't for me."
10447,"I've had this game sitting in my library for YEARS & I kept putting it off. Even after all of my friends highly suggested it, I couldn't see the amusement in the game. But I sat down one night and actually dove into this game - I am now obsessed. I can't STOP playing it. There's always something to do, and everyone & everything is just so cute. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a new casual/cozy game.

10463,"Literally amazing. The only negative thing I can think of is that the music while mining doesn't last nearly as long as I want it to. The mining soundtrack is amazing and I want to hear it constantly while mining. Aside from that small issue, this game is awesome.

10478,"This game Is a blast, I would recommend this to anyone It's fun It's peaceful and there's action. now my favorite part of this game has to be the mines, the mines are so fun that by the time I'm done It's night.
now another thing that's really fun for me Is the multiplayer, I love speedrunning the cc with a friend, or going into the mines with a friend. oh and multiplayer Is really cool you can change how It works like you can change
If you want to split the money or separate them. and for the last two things that are great we have farming and dating now there's tons and tons of content and maybe like 100+ hours of content In this game but
one thing I do for some reason is the first day I start I go the the person I want to dates house and talk to them but that's not really gonna do much If you really wanna get hearts with someone give them gifts 
they like if you need help with that go to the wiki It's a great help. and now for the last thing,
Farming, Farming Is really really fun for me, I just love the feeling of waking up and watering my plants and other things. and farming Is really simple if you need a guide just search one up. find out the rest and your own gl.

10498,"I used to play this game during 1.3 on switch and had a lot of fun. While I have had the PC version for a few years now I only just got back into it recently and have played it a ton. Lots of fun, but it can be quite stressful at times."

10532,Farming shouldn't be as entertaining as this
10533,farmer joe
10534,"While Animal Crossing New Horizons and Stardew Valley are both amazing games for rest and relaxation, what sets these two games apart is the freedom of pacing yourself. In Animal Crossing, many things are time gated in real time such as building a bridge or gaining new residents. This directly limits how much a player is able to play in a given day. This cycle eventually causes said game to feel forced and repetitive to the point which causes the game to feel more like a chore to play. In comparison Stardew Valley's time system can be controlled via in game sleeping. This means that time based objectives such as upgrading a tool or growing crops are much more in control of the player. On top of everything, Stardew valley has a much better way of creating goals for the player to reach, from conquering the Mines and Skull cavern, to completing the Community Center, exploring Ginger Island, to finally True Perfection. The Music, Art style, Characters and large variety of content all created by one man alone (Eric Barone) ultimately fascinates me as to how a masterpiece can be created from the ground up."
10535,i'm literally addicted
10536,Like animal crossing. Good game.
10537,"fram
"
10538,"it's a nice calming game that's for sure
"
10539,GREAT for playing with 9 yr old.
10540,"A friend from Twitch purchased this for me on Steam as a gift so we could play multiplayer, though I had been playing and modding prior to that on Android. Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) is a genius, and Stardew is a masterpiece. I've purchased copies for some other friends and should the need arise I would gladly buy anouther copy to play on additional platforms."
10541,extremely relaxing
10542,its nice

10550,"This game has consumed my friend, sister and I. It's taken us into a death spin, and now all we think about is trash, fish, cows, and cheese. My friend has single-handedly made a starfruit empire. He has turned an island into a base of corruption. He's the truest of menaces. My sister has stared saving the ocean, or just trying to start a snail kingdom, I'm unsure. I mostly have been trying to befriend the town for all their goods. Good game 10/10, don't have much to say."
10551,"Love this game, recommend that anyone who is interested in it picks it up. I'd never played a farming game before stardew valley and it got me hooked. Check out the mods for the game too, I have over 100 mods installed and my game is currently super cottagecore but I also have a horror theme save, traditional Japanese farm save, and a wizard's apprentice in training save thanks to the mod community. You can pack so much customizability into this baby *smacks stardew valley on the side*"

I would describe it as a perfect blend of cozy and adventure. You definitely won't run out of things to do. The start almost could use a little more instruction, but half the fun is in the trial and error of discovery."

And then, every single time I play it, because Im bored or so, I start likeah, here is where I were last and then, 3 hours later I realize I have stuff to do. Writing this while playing. Its a really good game, like, animal crossing on steroids. its nice to interact with the people, see their events and build up relations. Yu always have something to do and you cant stop playing, once you are in. I have no idea, why I forget this every time I close the the game."

10694,the mayor is hot
10695,farming with friends is fun
10696,"I have over 100 hours in this game combining both the Xbox and Steam version. Over those 100+ hours I have gone through many characters, friendships, and story choices in this game.

There are so many pros to this game, stellar 2D graphics, an amazing sound design and soundtrack, a brilliant story with so many different directions, both in the positive and negative based on your actions, not just for the main story, but also the side stories, character development, and even your own character's character arc if you decide to do one. The game-play is easy to understand and is never gets stale since there's so many different things you can do in just a single day. The amount of content and easter eggs is truly astounding and just adds to the overall enjoyment of Stardew Valley, after playing for so long on both PC and Xbox there is still so many things I haven't seen or done, which gives it such a great replay value. Character progression in terms of in-game skills is also varied, allowing you to go for whatever you want, or maxing them all out, truly becoming the best farmer the valley has ever seen.

I don't really have many cons for Stardew Valley. My two main ones (even then they are still minor with in game ways to make it less annoying) are as followed. My biggest issue is that fishing is extremely busted in terms of making money, many times there isn't a reason to really do anything else like farming, foraging, or mining other than doing the missions given out and to upgrade your farm. Although a counterpoint is that any profession can make you ludicrous amounts of money, but fishing is by far the easiest, and quickest way to make a lot of cash in the game, especially in the first year of the game. My other main issue is clothing, excluding hats, the only way to get new clothing once you pick your set of clothes for your character (as far as I am aware) is by using a sewing machine either in one of the NPC's houses or after completing said NPC's special request in which case you are rewarded your own sewing machine. I would love it if there was a clothing store or a clothing catalogue you could buy some of the default shirts and pants from, or allowing the player to pick a few sets of clothes they could switch through via a dresser to make it more realistic/to make the game feel less stale with allowing some variety in wha your character can pick to wear each day, which would also allow for new items and things to do like washing and drying your clothes. I haven't encountered any bugs, glitches, or exploits as of writing this. 

Overall, Stardew Valley is absolutely stellar. There are so many positives from this game that I couldn't list em all, and every con that exists is minor in scale and not that big of a deal all things considered. I absolutely recommend this game to everyone, it is genuinely a 10/10 experience you'll never wanna stop playing."
10697,Very Good
10698,This game is great. Relaxing and easy to play. I love that you can follow a strict goal oriented schedule or you can play leisurely.
10699,its epic
10700,"good game, great game even"
10701,You can make slaves good game
10702,".
"
10703,I played this a ton on xbox and finally caved and bought it on pc during the summer sale. This game is so fun with tons of things for all kinds of players and is works super well in multiplayer. If you're hesitating to buy stop it get it now do it
10704,"I got and immediately racked up 40 hours in 3 days. I was addicted. The game is simple, and relaxing (most of the time). But After my 40 hr binge, I found myself almost not playing the game at all.
Even though I might not play it much anymore, I still got 47 hrs of it and it is definitely worth the price.

If u want a chill game where you can just vibe and not have to worry about logging in everyday, or grinding, then this is a good game for you. Also a good game to sink a crap ton of hours into and then never play again.

Very pog."
10705,literally the grind is insane i am addicted asf

10713,"This game isn't just a calm farming simulator that it may appear to be at first glance. It goes much deeper and progress just keeps going no matter how long you spend in this game.

10717,really fun! very peaceful
10718,"I find this game both soothing and satisfying as I progress through the game and earn achievements. There aren't monsters jumping at you and killing you, making you lose your things, which is nice. But there are a lot of aspects to the game and challenges to meet, which keeps it interesting. It's the perfect game to play after a long, stressful day in the real world!"
10719,this is a good game and a long game that your dad plays that lets you have no free time to play anything!!

10749,"100000% recommend. I started playing this around 2017 and it still has me hooked. I highly recommend if you're looking for an escape, a home away from home. Stardew Valley accommodates for multiple play styles with a primary focus on the relaxation factor. There are so many things to do in this game and I just can't get enough. I couldn't ask for better in a farming sim. Thank you ConcernedApe for bringing me comfort for over 5 years."

10759,"I love the calming vibe of this game. I could play it for hundreds of hours. I have several save files and never get tired playing it. The pixelated style is so fitting for this game, and just when you think you've unlocked everything, there is always another surprise waiting. 
I also have a lot of anxiety with various different triggers, and this game helps to calm me down and I would always recommend to someone who struggles with anxiety or just needs a calm little vibe every once and a while. 
Long story short, buy. this. game."

10761,Catfish need to stop outplaying me
10762,It's relaxing.
10763,"Yes I think that this game is very fun, relaxing, and enjoyable. This game has combat, a sort of pixelated art style, farming, mining, and everything in between. I have only around 4 hours right now but in those 4 hours I have never played a more chill game besides minecraft that actually makes me calm down"
10764,"I played it on the Switch first and am addicted to it. I like how relaxing and fun it is, and recently I started playing Co-Op on it & it's so fun to chat with friends and play. I highly recommend to anyone who likes laid-back and easy going games."

10837,"I love this game!! I used to play it on gamepass before getting it on steam, and it's such a cute game that you can spend hours on without getting bored- with or without friends.
Even if you don't like the farming aspect of the game, you can still form friendships (or more) with the townspeople and do quests to help the town out!

Would definitely recommend for anyone who likes chill, cozy games :)"
10838,"Even tho I don't have the most hours played on Stardew Valley, or I haven't finished every achievement in the game. Stardew Valley is one of the games that I will always get back to. If you enjoy farming simulators, interesting stories, or just relaxing wholesome gameplay, you will most likely enjoy Stardew Valley. Even if you enjoy automatization and maxing your efficiency in Stardew Valley you can do that too! Stradew Valley will always have a place in my little heart."
10839,"Stardew has become and absolute comfort game for me.  I have the game on other platforms as well.  If you are looking for a game to play solo or to start a farm with your friends.  This is the game for you.  Grab your warm drink, comfy clothes, and get ready for the coziest vibes ever!"

Then don't. You choose how you want to run your farm. Crops or none. Animals or none. With friends or solo. Just get it."
10860,Ever thought of running away and building your own farm in a discreet village outside the real world and living a simple life with your own produce? No? This game will make you want to. Also killing slimes.

When a potato died due to the suns harsh weather, a piece of my heart died with it. This game, NO, this LIFE CHANGING experience has made me realize that I want to be a farmer when I grow up."
10869,I have now replaced my real life with stardew valley
10870,"Doesn't replace real life, but I can see why some may choose to substitute this for real life.
Get if you're lonely like the rest of the world, or get if you actually have friends and stuff.

10877,"Best stress relieving game in existence, there are few instances where you'l be stressed out by this game"
10878,"Boring, dull, and tedious, this game is a cute farming/life sims that isn't fun and latches highly on to human's natural desire for nostalgia. The very short length of day never matches the excessively high amount of stuff to do pushing you to rush every activity and miss out on a lot of stuff; thereby turning what would be a relaxing and simple farming game into an overly complicated yet shallow one. I loved Harvest Moon which led mo this game but My Time at Portia took me away from it and I just could never look back. This dev of this game is amazing for crafting such a very successful game but sadly, it isn't for me."

10923,"very good gaming
"
10924,"Good game. Not very different from all others of the same genre but its simplistic look can be good for people with old pc. Always something to do and lots of missions. The crafting is not pleasant in my opinion but that's only me probably. While you might think time passes way too fast, it's actually a good way to focus on one or two things per day at a time. Do not plan to do too much in a day because you will not like the experience. Take your time, relax, enjoy.

I wanted to farm
I farmed
I will farm again
You should try it."

10927,Unfun...
10928,"I keep coming back to this game from time to time to just relax, I dont know why it just keeps it's own little spot in the back of my head I can lean into when things gets rough or you had a bad day.
And Ive uninstalled more times than I cared to count but it somehow keeps coming back and getting installed and played again.

It's like going to a classical concert with a master conductor, it kinda all becomes a blur and you can't really appreciate the full worth and depth of it until you've been away from it and it keeps dragging you back for more and that's the magic of it, it cant really be explained, it just is.

With about 510 hours played and probably a few hundred more coming I can surely say it was worth the price back then and it's surely worth the price today, with or without any offer.


"
10929,It's good. Very good. I pick it up once a year and add another 150 hours to my total playtime

10958,I was interested at first because of the CO-OP I love when I can play games with my friends. A friend bought the game for me and we played together. There was so much to the game. There’s still so much I don’t know about the game. I have been playing on my own too. It’s an amazing game. Something even better you can play offline on your own too. 10/10
10959,The game is perfect in every way for people who enjoy farming sims. It's cute there's heaps of romance options and lots of secrets
10960,just a masterpiece
10961,"The only farming game you ever really need to play (at the time of reviewing). No other farming game comes even close to doing what SV does half right, and the mod community just gives you a considerable amount more of content if you ever get bored of the vanilla version."
10962,its a really enjoyable game!!

10976,"I do really enjoy, this game its a sweet little farm game, where you can also mine, fish, and forage. You can also fall in love with other people in the town! The only thing i wish would be fixed is, if you pause and leave it for too long it may unpause on its own sometimes, this may ruin your game, it recently happened to me and i went through almost an entire season. Other than this its a great game though!"
10977,its very fun and can be simple but also very complicated. very much worth the price as a simple farming sim. recommend 8.7/10
10978,uwu
10979,good game :)
10980,"I recommend this game 
But
Cancel Mayor Lewis
I hate Mayor Lewis
He's gaslit me multiple times, especially when I put the purple underpants in the soup at the Luau. He GUILTRIPPED ME. A BUNCH OF PIXELS MADE ME RESTART THE DAY BECAUSE I FELT BAD.
CANCEL MAYOR LEWIS."
10981,"fun game, its easy to play for hours on end. Very calming to play with the soundtrack going on in the background. I defiantly recommend for people who want an experience for something like animal crossing but have like a constant thing to do instead of having to log off all the time to wait for the next thing to do. Love that."

10988,"I Would Rate This Game A Solid 9.9 Because It is Very Close To Perfection. The List Of Things to Do Is Practically Endless, I always Enjoy Building my Own Things And Going My own Foolish Ways, And This Game Makes Me feel Welcome. Sure I May Not Have As Much Of This As I Should But I seem to always Have Fun In this game, Even When Standing Around Wasting Time. Also I can Get A Girlfriend In This Game SO that Bumps It up A to Solid 8 Already."
10989,The soundtracks and pixel artwork are gorgeous.

11000,"I cannot say enough good things about this game. The realistic situations, farming, etc. and stories. The togetherness of the town and people. Not taking the little things for granted and being there for each other, even if you don't always agree. And then to top it off with fantasy, fighting, role playing, mini games, and the amazing feeling of completing a task or making another character happy is just awesome. The fact that there was an astronomical amount of work made by such an amazing person makes it so much better. Thank you ConcernedApe, I hope you know how many peoples' lives you've changed and hearts you've touched by this masterpiece."
11001,"Amazing game, fun to sit down and calm down while playing, built around a neat community with big choices for the player to make, and to top it all off, multiplayer compatible and so fun to play with friends. Truly a work of indie art."
11002,"Fun, wholesome game. 10/10 would recommend for a deserted island game."
11003,Is good game.
11004,"cant stop playing, im addicted and i havent spent any time with my family the fateful day i purchased this game. All I do is plant, mine, breaking bad, sleep and repeat."
11005,cool beans
11006,"I just started the Stardew Valley game, but I fell in love with it!"
11007,Such a fun and relaxing game. 10/10. Would definitely recommend if you need a game to unwind.
11008,"This game is really addicting really quickly. I got it for PC so I can mod it, but vanilla is just as fun!"
11009,"A wonderful game to play with friends or by yourself, I absolutely adore it!"
11010,"For people who love farming simulation games this one is awesome!
You can be a rancher, a farmer, a miner, a fighter, an explorer.... Befriend NPCs and marry your favorite one - or Co-op friends -plus have children with them (if that becomes one of your ingame goals).

There's a little for every kind of player. Have fun!"
11011,love this game! if you are considering on buying it do it! i would say it is worth it
11012,"this game is very cozy and cool and the multiplayer is well made
"
11013,"This game is very relaxing, and I love it. After a long day, when I'm sore, and tired, I open this game and take care of my farm and my animals. Everybody in the town is very unique and it's fun to just go around talking to people and making friends with everybody except one person you dislike. In addition, the style is very charming, whether it's the town's design or the adorable chickens, I can't really find one thing in this game that it fails at accomplishing. Overall, I'd recommend this game, as it's varying playstyles can help accommodate just about anyone. Want to just relax and take care of animals and crops? Pick the basic farm. You want more combat and action? Go for the farm that has more space, but enemies. Need a break and want to play an arcade game? Go to the bar and play the mountain king game. 

               10/10 - 'The chicken looks like my left testicle' 
                                                                              - My friend"
11014,steals your life
11015,"Without a doubt, Stardew Valley is the farming sim for you. Whether you're new to the genre or an old head like me, this game is approachable and enjoyable, with enough depth and complexity to keep you playing for years to come."
11016,"Iz good
"
11017,This game is what I define as real time killer.
11018,"This game is Minecraft meets Harvest Moon meets the Sims, and I can't praise it any higher than that."
11019,lovly game
11020,I like being the emo's gay awakening. 10/10
11021,"I really loved this game, its a very well made fantasy game mixed with a farming sim."
11022,"Disclaimer: I have way more hours played in this game as shown, but changed accounts since. I wrote this review relatively at the beginning of playing, and since played through the main story. My two only criticisms are the time passing: its fun in the beginning of the game, when you are grinding and it really matters what you do every day. However, once you have pretty much completed the game and just want to check in at your farm and hang out, it becomes somewhat annoying. The other issue I had, before the most recent update, is the few options you have for decorating your farm. However, I LOVE. Lo-ve the new additions. So overall, 10/10 would recommend this game to anyone.

Stardew Valley
An RPG farming simulator that incorporates the best of Pokemon, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Minecraft and Don’t starve together. You can grow crops, raise animals, process farmed goods to artisan products, explore and fight in mines, forage, fish and socialize with townsfolk.
Graphics:	7/10
The pixel art and fixed perspective follows the example of the old gen 3 Pokemon games. This can be a huge plus for some players who enjoy the retro vibes of the game but can throw off players seeking breathtaking high definition environments found in newer games.
Despite the minimalism in graphics, the overall game design does not lack customization of your own character and plot, allowing players to build unique farms. The map is compact but allows the player to unlock new areas to explore over time.
Music:		10/10
The beautiful soundtrack plays a huge factor in the charme of this game. I found myself not enjoying the game as much significantly, and even feeling less urge to play when the sound was off. The sound effects are extremely satisfying, from chopping wood to watering plants, and the ambient music is beautiful and varied that you never get fed up with it. Unlike the Pokemon soundtrack which can get obnoxious to the point where rumours claim it drives people to suicide, Stardew Valley’s relaxing tunes will always be a source of comfort and happiness.
Controls: 	5/10
On the PC, controls can be confusing as both right and left click perform certain tasks. This can lead to some accidental destruction of crops with your axe or the unwanted question of whether you want to eat an item you are currently carrying. Nonetheless. The controls are simple and do not require much practise.
Gameplay:	8/10
As it is a farming simulator, most tasks are concerned with the daily watering of crops, collecting produce and taking care of your animals. This can get repetitive, but as the game progresses, mechanisms that automize the process can be acquired. However, to some these activities are part of the joy in playing Stardew Valley, imitating popular mobile games like Farmville which are entirely built around these mechanisms. Once the duties on the farm are completed, players can engage in more challenging activities like fishing, foraging or fighting in the mines. Additionally, designing and decorating the farm, organizing crops and buildings is a big part of gameplay that many enjoy. Overall, there is a variety of activities which players can indulge in, allowing for different playstyles and preferences.
To top it off, there is also a multiplayer mode available, which allows for friends to help each other out or build separate farms. Edit since the new update: there has been so much new content added, including new missions for players who have completed the “main story” of the game. Absolutely love this.
Story:		10/10
While most of Stardew Valley’s experience is an open-world gameplay that allows you to follow any activity you want without a storyline to follow, there are cutscenes and progressions that unlock when certain conditions are met. Some of the interactions with villagers are very emotional and go beyond simple video game storylines. Throughout the first years, certain events and storylines change, keeping the game intriguing.
Characters:	9/10
The characters are original and interesting, the complete opposite of cookie-cutter Animal Crossing villagers with mostly irrelevant interactions. Some may completely ignore the individual storylines of the townsfolk as it mostly does not impact gameplay, but if players pay close attention to dialogues and investigate houses thoroughly, they will come to appreciate the little story details hidden around town. Each villager has their own personality and schedule, allowing different people to find their favourite character and befriend them.
Originality:	6/10
Many aspects of Stardew Valley are found in other games, the difference is that Stardew Valley implements them so well. Fishing and foraging in Animal Crossing was one major source of income, Stardew Valley has it too – but it is only one activity of many. The multiplicity of activities makes the game more complex than many of its comparable rivals. A bonus is that the game is constantly being updated and receives even more details and additions that keep it interesting even to long-time players. Upon much demand from the community certain villagers were made eligible for marriage which were previously not, and most recently the developer allowed players to vote on the next type of tree that will be introduced in the game (Mangos!!).
Difficulty:	5/10
The game is rather relaxing and does not make it difficult for players that want to take it slow. Of course, competitive players who want to maximize profits and efficiency will find that getting the most out of each day can be challenging. There are certain punishments, for example when staying out too late at night or running out of health or stamina, however these are not too drastic (like in Don’t starve for example, where constantly dying in winter for example can be extremely frustrating) 
There are two aspects which require closer inspection: the fighting and fishing mechanisms. Fighting in the mines becomes more difficult with each level, but overall does not exceed a level of difficulty that would make it hard to progress or frustrating to play. It provides a welcome alternative to the relatively risk-free farming and resource gathering, but can be done easily if players come prepared.
One point of much criticism is the fishing minigame, which can be extremely difficult and indeed frustrating. It becomes easier as the fishing skill increases, but makes it hard for new players to get into catching fish.

Everyone I have spoken to that has played or still plays Stardew Valley absolutely loves the game. I personally downloaded the game and played it for 15 hours straight on the first day, then 15 more hours the next. I have not yet tried the multiplayer mode, but find it best to fully explore the story and discover all aspects of the map and game before starting a farm with friends."

11045,Very easy to get lost in as well as to get started with. Very good looking game despite the 16bit look. Only real point against it is the almost obnoxiously loud music during the intro as well at the main menu.
11046,The only bad thing about this game is the urge it gives me to drag my irl organ container and move to a tiny quaint village and f*ck up capitalism in the name of farming. Unfortunately I do not have the ability to wake up before noon and who really wants to make friends?

11054,I love this game. I can come back to it over and over. It really always feels like there's stuff to do and the multiplayer mode is so fun. All the updates to it over the years have done a great job keeping it fresh while still being the same game that was so charming initially.
11055,It's cool
11056,I decided to get this game on kind of a whim - I will admit I found it a lot more calming and relaxing then I expected it to be - It has helped me with stress management on days where things a bit too chaotic or hectic - I have honestly enjoyed all the hours I have spent on the game and on a few occasions I ended up playing it for 6 hours straight without even realising how long I had spent on it - It's very addictive in a good way!

11088,For those times I just need to dissociate hard...
11089,Cute little fun game. I've finished it on other devices and it's so good I bought it again for PC. Hehehe :3
11090,"Honestly,"
11091,finally i can go outside
11092,"Big Joja corporation big bad, Farm big good"
11093,"i think i am getting the hang of this game and then i watch 'year 10 stardew valley farm tour' on youtube.com and realize i am but a speck of insignificant dust and although my farm may prosper, i shall never achieve godhood"
11094,farm crops. make money. very fun
11095,strawberry
11096,addictive
11097,a good game.
11098,"It's like your in the world, honestly , this game is an experience like no other! the storyline , the characters , the gameplay. 10/10 would recommend."
11099,farm go brrr
11100,"One of the best games I have ever played. Amazing music, graphics, story, and full of amazing scenes that will take your breath away, make you tense up, or relax. i have one of the worst PC's that I've ever seen, but it runs just fine, even with a huge farm filled with crops and machines! If you want a farming game that has a combination of fighting, fishing, romance, and exploration, with sandbox elements, you will LOVE this game."
11101,"AMAZING
"
11102,"

11103,"I like the game. Add modds to it, you'll have more stuff to explore."
11104,"Wonderful game, fun characters and cute dating sim. I myself mod and the modding community adds a lot, but the bad game alone is just as fun, a small detail is not being able to run makes doing things a little slow, otherwise from the farming, the dating, the exploration and hunting it’s a lot of fun and definitely worth getting at full price."
11105,Not laggy at all
11106,adictivo :) excelente para relajarse y pasar el tiempo
11107,I like the part where I stardew'd the valley
11108,"I've spent 94 hours in this game and i haven't completed it yet ;-;

11113,"Stardew Valley is great game all around. No complaints, I recommend it highly."
11114,Cool game.  A little sparse on starting information.  Great info on the Wiki and video sites if you want it.
11115,this game is so good
11116,i love being on the brink of death and eating 20 month old blackberries to heal me right up

11124,"very good time killer and is fun as all get out to see your farm go from eh to OH YEAH
"
11125,"Amazing game and the interactions are amazing as well. The game mechanics and gameplay gives much to offer, farming is fun and I rarely see it as an chore and more as an activity. All in all it's a fun game"

11129,waiting simulator
11130,"the perfect game for many people. there's so many different things you can do from simply farming, to mining hundreds of levels deep. i highly recommend people at least give this game a shot"
11131,One of my favorite games. Very fun and has a lot of replay potential. The characters are really interesting and the mechanics are just complicated enough to keep it engaging after multiple plays while also not driving away first time players.
11132,All my hours in this game has been so enjoyable. Especially fishing that part of the game is S-tier!!! Also like the gift system and the community feel and variety of characters.
11133,"this game was fun and exciting. the variety of quests and the many storylines kept the game entertaining every time I played it. Overall, I highly recommend it! :)"
11134,"it's casual,relaxing and i can have fun times with my friend"

11140,"This game has so much to do and there is story and some how it all comes back to farming and some people say it is bad into they play it bc when i first got it i thought it was going to be bad but no it turned out really funned
"
11141,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

11142,I love it
11143,"I say ""Morning"" cause if it were a ""Good Morning"" I'd be Fishing

11/10 save yourself before you go down the stardew hole"
11144,its good
11145,"Its a relaxing game with a lot of things to do, great for casual play"
11146,"i love the fishing mechanic in this game, i am one with the f i s h"
11147,"i always say ""morning"" instead of ""good morning"" because if it was a good morning i'd be fishing in my farm"
11148,"The Game is worthwhile even if the updates are far in between. There is still a lot to do even if you finished the main-story! Get a girlfriend, get another girlfriend, look in the trashcan while no one is looking, unknowingly get seen by someone, get hated by the town for placing stuff you found on the ground in the pot, end up fainting in your farm when you were about to head home and then end up an alone farmer on Stardew Valley! Things could never be better!"
11149,MY FAVORITE GAME I ABSALOUTLY LOVE THIS GAME I CAN FARM FISH MINE AND GET WIVES WHAT MORE COULD I WANT
11150,amazing game
11151,very fun engulfs you in like a tsunami
11152,it is fun and you can play it however you want
11153,"It's fun; If you liked the old harvest moon games, it's similar to that"
11154,it's very slay
11155,yes
11156,game so good it reminded me of the times my dad was still around 👍
11157,Better than real life
11158,"Very few games can make farming a fun activity, something to keep your mind off the world around you and Stardew Valley does just that. Its relaxing atmosphere is where you will find your escape, it sucks you in with a diverse and dynamic cast of characters to talk to interact with and discover. The actual farming aspect of this game is actually pretty streamlined and is what I would call a snap! Dungeons, Fishing, Mining, Foraging, Building, these all have extensive improvements and discoveries that just oozes not only curiosity but also making sure at the end of the day your having fun! I would absolutely give this a solid 10/10"
11159,"BUY IT OR ILL BURY YOU IN RANDOM STUFF I FIND, FISH AND FARM"
11160,"This is hands down the BEST game I've ever played. With hundreds of hours between mobile and Switch, my world of Stardew is now expanding to PC with mods and it's like getting to explore the game for the first time all over again. Truly, this game is PERFECT."
11161,its like atomicrops but without the nuclear explosions and bullet hell
11162,a game where you farm for long time without getting bored it has very calm and very cute graphics
11163,brilliant game! Very Addictive ive got 47.7Hrs in 4 days

11214,"Great value, LOTS of addicting content."
11215,Love this game its the best
11216,Truly lives up to the hype and I couldn't be more thankful!
11217,"If I had to think of what brings back to Stardew Valley as opposed to other farming type Sand Box styled games, if would have to be for its gameplay. Other games like this tend to be tedious or the beginning of those games tend to be unforgiving, but with Stardew it's much more easier to pick up and there's something pointing you in the right direction. You are also rewarded for exploring the world where you are able to find resources that will help you at any point in the game. Even that stupid fishing mini-game I struggled with when first playing I absolutely love now!

And unlike other farming type games Stardew Valley gives you other options on how you can run things in the game instead of relying solely on planting stuff. There have been many playthroughs where I either didn't touch crops or barely utilized them finding a completely new and fun way to play the game.

This is also a game where I can just set up a system and am able to do that over and over and over, you get that point. And that works well for me because it actually gets me focused as well as calms me down to a point where I find myself not only completely relaxed, but if I play this game before bed time I have tired my mind to where I can sleep just fine! This game is very therapeutic for me and it helps my unfocused brain just shut down and calm itself. That is just wonderful.

There is nothing quite like Stardew Valley, similar yes, but not to the degree of this game, and I feel like other games in the genre have been trying to replicate that. This may have been initially a love letter to the Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons franchise, but it has come a long way to diversify itself from it and I love that we have such a wonderful game."
11218,"Okay fam listen up. This is my favorite game *ever*. I adore Stardew Valley so much. It's been my safe space for quite a long time now! I started by watching playthroughs of it on YouTube back in 2016, and eventually got it on my old phone and quickly put in over 80 hours. Now here I am today, with this many hours on my laptop and working my way into over 50 hours now on my Switch. Don't miss out on this game, you'll regret not giving this one a chance. Five stars all around!"
11219,sebastian <3
11220,i love this game it consumes my every thought
11221,"OH MY GOD, I CANT STOP PLEEASE SOMONE HELP"
11222,:)
11223,i am farmer
11224,"I got so tired of all of these low-quality-graphics-styled games that have been coming out more recently, and that's why I really hesitated to get this game for so long. It just seemed like a boring, low-effort game, kind of like Animal Crossing but 8-bit. It's not though. In reality, Animal Crossing is incredibly boring compared to this game. This game is amazing.

One of the first things you notice is how complex the stories are, and how there's so much to discover. You could probably play this game for 6 months and still not have discovered half of the game's content. I feel like I've not even scratched the surface of what this game has for me. There are a million places for you to explore and a million more people to meet. 

On top of that, every villager in this game is so unique which is why it's so much fun to form relationships with them. While this game is very story-driven, there's a great mix of quests, exploration, and mindless wandering so you aren't stuck grinding one specific thing.

I don't want to spoil anything, so I'd recommend just buying the game and trying it out. It's adorable and just plain fun."
11225,"Amazing game, super fun story line"

11246,i started playing this game at 3 and after an hour it was 2 in the morning
11247,<3
11248,"I have bought this game twice, and each time it is totally worth it.

If you are looking for a challenging (With Mods!!) and relaxing game this is it, this is just IT.  I fell in love with the game years ago finally got it on steam after playing on a different launcher and I have never looked back, amazing modding community that gives the game so much replayability but even better, the vanilla game is so dang good.  You will lose hours and hours of your life but you will gain a sense of accomplishment and a deep love for the community in the process.

One of the only games I will honestly give a 10/10. 

My 40 hours at time of review is nothing compared to the hundreds of hours I've put into this game via GOG etc."
11249,"It is good game. Many farm. Many broken heart. 11/10

But actually a great game and a wonderful cozy experience"
11250,love the game cant stop playing
11251,"500+ hrs in this game... should be enough said there...

This game is one of those games where you start playing at 6pm and then all of a sudden it's 4am the next day. If you are thinking about buying this game, just buy it! Plenty of content, secrets, and ways to immerse yourself into the game. If you can catch it on sale it's an even better deal but for $15 you won't regret it."
11252,very fun game
11253,Its very easy to grasp the concept of this game. Def recommend to anyone.
11254,It's a really fun game!

11302,This game is such a welcome breath of fresh air. Its nice to stop the violent video games and just chill out to the music and go fishing or water crops. The game never ends you can play as much or as little you want and it just so peaceful and chill. 10/10 would recommend for sure

11324,"What you expect coming in: Farming, Ranching, a bit of Romance.

What you get: Cults, TIme Travel, Mega Corporation Takeover, Scandals, PTSD.

10/10"
11325,"I know this is gonna be disliked, so treat this as a ""Mixed"" review, but I'll get to that.

First, the good:

Stardew Valley is a cute little farming sim set in the small hamlet of Pelican Town. It is atmospheric and immersive, with well written characters that certainly feel real.
The music is great and fits perfectly with the current theme of the game, cheery and bright music for Spring and Summer, and calm and tranquil music for Autumn and Winter. Each romanceable character also has their own theme that plays during their relationship events, which can certainly aid you in falling in love with the character.
The pixelated art style makes the game feel cozy and relaxing, provided you can tell what you're looking at.

But that's about where my praises end, now the bad:

The beginning of the game is a slog, confusing, and directionless. I have countless saves that didn't make it past the first in game week from losing motivation to continue playing within a couple hours, then never playing again for months before coming back and starting again.
There is no sense of purpose and the game doesn't show you what is supposed to be your goal until you are hours in, the Community Centre, but that itself provides little to actually do at the start, once you add everything you can from this season you can't do much beyond wait until the next season.
The mechanics of the game are poorly explained with the in game tutorial ending at two boxes at the side of the screen telling you how to walk. You are never even told how to buy crops, and how each crop differs from each other, for example.
The game requires you to have the community made wiki open on a second monitor almost at all times, destroying any immersion it had, as the game never tells you where different fish are located, or what gifts a character likes, unless you are willing to spend many hours trying to do trial and error, and writing down the outcome of it for future reference, which is obviously a lot more difficult than just opening the wiki.
The in game day is hardcoded to end at 2 am, causing you to pass out, and if you're anywhere but your farm, you'll have items and money stolen from you, but again this isn't told to the player until they've experienced it once, which can lead to you feeling cheated as some valuable items are deleted without warning. The closest the game comes to telling you is a ""It's getting late."" popup which to a new player wouldn't mean much.
This time limit can also lead to you wanting to maximise the most out of every day, so you don't miss something important that won't come back until next year, which can quickly lead to burn out as the game becomes more work than game. I have seen people say ""just don't play that way and just relax."" which is ok advice but I know some people, such as myself, that won't be able to rest if they're not constantly doing everything needed, which leads me to my final point.

This game is not for everyone, most games aren't, but on the question of ""Do you recommend this game?""; to a player new to gaming or just the average player in general? No, this game is very niche despite the very vocal playerbase. I could only recommend this game to someone with experience with the Harvest Moon style, who already knows what to expect, or someone with a strong resilience to the poor new player experience and motivation to get through to the second year, where, despite my hatred for this saying, I'd say the game truly begins."

11333,"Although it says currently 4 hours of game play, in reality I played this game for about a 100 hours or more, I played in cracked versions before finally getting the perfect time to buy the game. Totally worth it and I can finally support the developers that made the game.

The game is one of the chillest yet interesting games I ever played, It is one of the best games to play when you are not doing anything of importance."
11334,"It's a good game, definitely worth the price."
11335,love
11336,as an aromantic this game is very challenging
11337,"I absolutely love this game, it has unlimited potential. Grew up with Harvest Moon games my whole life and this is everything HM could have been and more.

11358,Played 195 hours and haven't even touched he virtual grass in my farm yet. 11/10. Seriously one of the best games ever.
11359,"This game has a very relaxing, charming vibe to it.  After having played it for about 11 hours, the gameplay potential still seems pretty big.  There's a lot I haven't done... haven't even tried to do.  The game doesn't force other avenues on you, either.  They are just there.  As a casual game that you can just jump into and out of as limited time demands, its pretty great.  It doesn't demand a lot, and it really helps me to zone out and unwind.  It sounds like faint praise, and in a way it is because I'm not invested in this game in the same way I am other, more intense games, but I still very much recommend it."

11399,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 21 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

11429,"Stardew Valley is one of the best games out there right now in the farm siming community in my opinion since the early harvest moon games. It has everything from Farming, Fishing, Mining, Fighting, and intriguing characters with backstory and lore. That the community can talk about. 

It has some of the nicest community memebers too; from the developers of mods for it to the first timer farmers. I have made some new friends and had fun with old ones on Stardew co-op. I have had the enjoyment of watching the game grow from buying it back in 2016 to regetting obessed with it now in 2022.

I would recommend this game to anyone who loves cozy casual farming games along with my fellow fans of the harvest moon series as this one is one of the best farming games out there!"

I went through the entire game to achieve perfection and while it is very tedious, especially because of all of the requirements around it, it is the perfect goal for those who love the game. Co-op is tons of fun, although depending on connection strength, the mines can be a little iffy for those who are not host."

This game gave me everything I enjoyed about Harvest Moon and more! There are so many cute stories and secret events,. The game also does a really good job at making the repetition of years/events not boring. I had a great time playing it in singleplayer, but I highly recommend playing it co-op with a bestie if you can."

11527,"This game is great for people who like casual games. Something that has action, but isn't overly frustrating. Stardew Valley allows you to choose different paths, friends, and goals, making it a fun game to just explore. If you've had a hard time with another game, then you can just boot up Stardew and have a relaxing evening. Although the beginning is somewhat boring, I really like how after a while, you get used to the gardening, ranching, mining, and fishing mechanics.

Overall an 8/10 :D"

If you want a challenge, it's there for you, but if you feel like winding down and doing a whole lot of nothing then that's a possibility too. There's an endless amount of good things to say about this game, it's great."

11542,"Good fishing simulator!
"
11543,"beautiful game

first off, the music is amazing. every single track is perfect for the themes.

secondly, the prices for things is balanced and grinding overall is good and even enjoyable most times, though i imagine it will end up getting boring at some point, however my point still stands.

thirdly theres way more features than just farming. I mean, you can mine, do quests, forage for stuff, cut down trees, cook food, go fishing, gift the other villagers, and eventually even get married and have children. So even if its winter, you haven't got any crops planted or much, you've always got alternatives so you dont just immediately go back to bed and sleep for the next day.

thirdly it has modding support so you can create and download mods from other people. this has allowed me to add mods for the game so I can progress much faster and stuff

another great thing is that bugs on this game are practically non-existent, which means you can play the game worry-free.

the only downside i can think of is that the game only saves after you sleep, which means you will lose some progress if you forget to sleep before quitting the game. At the same time, this isn't really much of an issue anyway because anything you lose is still re-obtainable.

overall, I rate this game 11/10."

11582,"This game is for those who likes achieving, collecting,  and  profiting as you turn a rundown farm and community center into  order. Your farm can really make some profit with what you choose to farm including animals and fruit trees. As for the community center, you have some choices that will either turn it into a movie theater later or a place that the villagers will use for their crafts. There is mining in some locations that prove challenging for some faint at heart but you can work them a few floors at a time and they are fun. there's relationships and stories to uncover and friendships to make as you adventure your way through this game. Also there's added content now and a whole new places to explore and new villagers to meet too. In these new places comes new trees and things to craft and collect. In this game, you get to choose, craft, and enjoy. The new places makes this game new again so if you've played this game before, try it again and see the new developments to experiment. Enjoy and adventure on."
11583,"highly recommend if you want to spread your seed, become a gold digger, or upskill your hoe proficiency"

11605,I love it so I play it to calm down. You can do whatever you want in this game and the story is great. I love how long the game is too it's not something you buy and finish the same day. I highly recommend this for players that just have a lot of free time or if you liked animal crossing.

Also, mods. So.. yeah. This really doesn't need an extensive review anymore."

11667,Fun and Wholesome. Great relaxing game
11668,i got bored
11669,"After years and years of having this indie darling sit on my library shelf, I finally pulled it out and decided to play it.
I wanted a game that had a really satisfying grind and progression system, and I got just that. Stardew Valley really scratches that work-reward itch, if slightly too generously. Since tons of heap has already been praised onto this game, I will instead try and put into words what I thought might've made the game more enjoyable.
1. More challenge. Maybe there's a mod for this, but I would've liked something more abrasive, more difficult. Most of the challenge I get from this game is remembering what I should be doing next! And sometimes it makes me wonder whether I might not be losing my memory in my old age. 
2. Varying costs of items like in a free market. I'd have liked it if the prices of materials and produce were variable over time, like in an actual market place dictated by scarcity. It would have added another dimension to the game that would've made it a lot more interesting. 
3. More story content. I enjoyed the little bit of story content provided so far, but there really could be a lot more.
4. More mature. Not necessarily meaning to push it into R-rated territory, just to have more interesting and serious themes explored throughout. I think the quick time events could have been used to do this. 
Those are the areas where I would have made changes to the game myself. 
But that said, stellar experience, hard to put down, I'm going to probably see this save game through to the end of year 2 hopefully having gotten married by then and earned 2 mill."
11670,Seems simple at first but has plenty of depth for people that want to try and master/min/max everything
11671,this game is awesome
11672,Everyone hates me in this town :)
11673,I have been eyeing this game for so long! This is probably my first game purchase that i really enjoyed playing. playing this made me realize how much i like pixel graphic games. I hope to find another game like this!
11674,awesome
11675,"absoluetly amazing game <3 so much more than just a cute rural town - one of the best games ive played in such a long time. its addictive and has such a comforting aspect to it, id reccomend to anyone who enjoys humorous, adventuring, cozy, and mystical games."

11712,"It's probably one of the best games that I've played in a while. So much gameplay and exploration and the replay value is really high, and that's from a game made back in 2016. The only gripe I have is the fact that I need more lore and dialogue and opportunities for interactions with your spouse and the other villagers (but then there are mods for it.) Overall a great experience and would recommend it if you love minecraft, harvest moon, terraria and/or a dating sim."
11713,yes

I would most definitely recommend this to other people who want a long, good story-telling game with a variety of activities to do. Highly recommend this game"
11718,was watching rtgame play stardew recently and it made me wanna get back into the game. needless to say this game is addicting
11719,"Always a fun adventure! I've played it for years on my switch and just got it on my computer so I can mod it!! I love the base game and when you add new NPCs and quests it only gets better. 100/10, one of the best games every created! Eric did an amazing job and the more I learn about the game the more I love it! With over 500 hours on the switch I still haven't even 100% complete it. This is because I just love the process of the game and it doesn't force you to complete everything to be successful in the game. You can choose your own path.
"

11721,I occasionally meet people who haven't played it yet and beg them to play!
11722,"A very fun farming sim with a lot of neat gameplay elements, an addictive core gaming loop, gorgeous visuals, a great soundtrack, and amazing characters!"
11723,i love bingus
11724,"Quite relaxing, no high-stakes fighting modes - yet at least - and is a nice change for the fast-paced games I usually play. 

I suggest memorizing the map early on so you don't get lost with low energy!"
11725,i love finishing all my chores IRL so i can load up this game to do more. what is life.
11726,this game patched my divorce.
11727,"If you're curious enough about this game to read reviews, you should buy it, whether it's on sale or not. Stardew Valley is one of the few games out there that's actually [i]underpriced[/i]. It's the best $15 I have ever spent in gaming, and I have gotten my money's worth a hundred times over.

The great thing about Stardew Valley is that it has an activity for every mood. Need some stress-free time to unwind? Spend the day farming, fishing, or saying hi to the folks in town. Want some high-stakes action? Go treasure-hunting in the monster-infested mines. Want a real challenge? The arcade games in the town saloon are challenging enough to be Steam games in their own right. What you do each day is up to you. No activity is required to beat the game, but they are all so engaging and rewarding that you will find yourself planning your actions days in advance so that you can do them all!

A gamer who goes through their life without having played Stardew Valley has missed out on something truly special. In terms of quality, customizability, replayability, progression, and heart, it stands toe-to-toe with any AAA title out there. It's one of the best video games I've ever played."
11728,just a good calming game (except mining) <3 thats pretty much it i've mainly used it to mod

11736,"Very chill and there is a lot to do!

11765,"    If you haven't already, get this game. You are missing out on so much. Stardew Valley is a cute little game where you own a farm, in a little farm called Stardew Valley. You can grow crops or harvest animal products from your animals to earn money. There are some mines that you can slay monsters like slimes, skeletons, and much more. There is also a community center with little cute apple guys called junimos and it is abandoned so you have to find items to put in bundles for the junimos and they will give you presents like seeds for your farm or food and stuff like that. Once you complete a certain amount of bundles in a thing you can get a star and you will get a special reward that unlocks a new part of the map. You can also go fishing and catch a different variety of different fish. You can also marry somebody and have up to 2 kids and tghey are so adorable and fun to take care of! You can also give them little hats that you can get from a hat mouse guy. Overall, Stardew Valley is a cute little farm simulator for all kinds of people. GeT iT nOw!!!"

This game is amazing. You have so many options to focus on, if you don't like farming too much, you can automate it, and go mining, if you don't like that, you can fish to gain your wealth, or you can work to find all the hidden books and find wealth there. I love this game, it's a little addictive but amazing overall. Soundtrack is amazing to enjoy to calm down after a long day."

11806,"Very relaxing and therapeutic for a busy mind. Could do with longer day cycles but other than that, really good."
11807,"I've played countless hours of Stardew Valley across many platforms. Not just PC. It's hard to believe anyone could dislike this game, unless you simply are not interested in farming sims. 

Like many Harvest Moon inspired games, you inherit a farm and leave the big city behind. What makes Stardew so special is the characters. Stardew Valley gives us a variety of characters and a deep look into their problems as you develop your relationship with them. No one is perfect and that is what makes it so special. 

The game also takes all the best aspects of your typical farming sims to create a new expansive experience for the player to enjoy. Even after countless new games I still learn something new, whether it be something I can do with an item, or about another NPC that I didn't know about previously. 

Stardew Valley is a lovely and charming game. And while the game does have a few minor negatives, it's really hard to say anything negative about the game. Concerned Ape did a wonderful job with it."

I've been playing for around two weeks, and the hours I've played on my Nintendo Switch combined with Steam are over 100 at this point.

11852,addictive. ive played 10 hours in a day. save yourself while you can
11853,God I FUCKING LOVE farming blueberries.
11854,"Beautiful Art-Style and a very good experience overall.

There are some cripes, if you want to get deep into customising the look of the farm-house and having different outfits, this might not be for you, those systems are present but they aren't particularly deep. 

The game is surprisingly expansive, there are multiple large dungeons and the upgrades to the farm let you get very far into progression. Your milage my vary on the character interactions. I can't say the village social aspects interest me at all. 

Amazing for COOP, I would not recommend the solo experience"
11855,"It let me live my dream of quitting my day job and owning my own farm while also taking down a corporation, 10/10"

11905,"Very elaborate farm-themed dating sim,

10/10."
11906,thank you Stardew Valley i have emo wife now 10/10
11907,"I'm a huge farming sim gamer and have been playing the classic Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons games since the early 2000s. I can say with confidence that Stardew Valley by far tops them all.

This game has refined the genre so much I truly believe it is now the gold standard for not just farming sims but crafting, survival and lifestyle games. There is so much to play with - just when you think you've hit the end of what you can do, even more unlocks to the point where you could theoretically play this game forever. I just might!

When I first bought this game in 2017, a lot of the features Stardew Valley now boasts had not yet been released and even THEN it was remarkable. With the addition of online multiplayer and other secret goodies I won't spoil, this game is a delight to share with friends and loved ones.

Farming is extensive and excellent. Ranching is optimised for all kinds of play styles, be it selling the animals and their products outright or refining them into more complex artisan goods. The lifestyle simulator is extensive and emotive. It is clear so much thought and love has been put into crafting characters with thoughts and feelings analogous to people everyone will know in the real world.

One developer made this, the gameplay, the art, the music, everything. I cannot fully express in words just how amazing that is or how deeply this game changed my experience with gaming. A hobby I once engaged in alone I now share with friends because Stardew Valley is just so easy and so appealing for beginners to pick up and play. My mum LOVES this game.

If you have any doubt in your mind, please buy this game. And then push it on your friends and loved ones like the addictive, delightful time sink it is.
"
11908,"very relaxing, though the tutorial should be longer."
11909,very cool

Another reason I love it is because one of the NPCs look like my partner IRL (Elliot). It was  atotal shock when I first saw him and I totally had to try and romance.

Love this game and I totally reccomend."

One of my favorites games of all time. BUY IT!
"
11947,its good
11948,"Nothing like Stardew Valley to truly relax. One of the best RPGs ever made that has a fantastic story, soundtrack and general vibe."
11949,"Whenever I need to escape, I go to Stardew Valley."
11950,This is a wonderfully relaxing game. Its simplistic pixel graphics are so detailed and suck you into this world. This is a must have if you need a game where you can just decompress.
11951,very nice
11952,"It's a better harvest moon. I really have nothing else to say about it. Do you like Harvest moon? You're gonna like this game. It's not on any real time system, so taking a break for 3 days won't destroy all your progress. The characters are charming, and the art style is charming, and everything is charming. This is just a relaxing good time. You want to turn your brain off and farm. Do it with this."
11953,"I don't have many hours on steam, but have 800+ on nintendo switch.  In that time, I've decided that I love this game.  It might just be my favorite game of all time.  Sure, it doesn't have great 3D graphics or a deep lore behind it, but it's fun.  It's relaxing.  Or, it can be so stressful as you try to do the math to decide what you need to make the highest profit.  It is a game for everyone and anyone.  Plus, it's cheap- skip lunch some day and check out Stardew Valley.  It's worth it."
11954,:D
11955,"If you love other farming sims then this is the game for you.
Absolutely wonderful gameplay, with inclusive marriage options for your character and a combat system to boot."
11956,10/10. Amazing game
11957,relaxed to play
11958,this is a game where farm crop and sell crop and blueberry is and
11959,There are so
11960,ive played this game for way to long
11961,"Good game, it's like a mix of Terraria and Animal Crossing, so if you like those games it's perfect for you. I enjoy it, it's a nice relaxing game that doesn't need to be rushed through, and there's many relationships and aspects to explore too."
11962,"An absolutely amazing and relaxing farming game with a lot of depth and over all one of my favorite games.
Would highly recommend this to anyone who need to relax."
11963,"this game has so so so much to do its insane, nobody ever plays the game the same and each playthrough is always different. the creator loves his community and works hard to make the game better. you can play this game for hours and never get bored"
11964,Stardew Valley is a wonderful game and has set the standard for all indie games. Most games will compare to this game!
11965,The perfect casual comfort game.
11966,it's good
11967,VERY FUN
11968,good game 10/10 (alex my beloved)

11971,Great game to play both singleplayer and multiplayer. Relaxing with so many things to do.
11972,amazing
11973,"Its supposed to be peaceful: heads up, for me, it's not. But as a person who sets goals and fights like hell to achieve them, the stress is worth the reward. I would definitely purchase the game for such a greatprice with all the fun hours of gameplay you can get!"
11974,"Such a good game, wasn't sure but it's like minecraft in a pokemon format and its fire"
11975,is a releaxing game and fun. :3
11976,its cool tbh
11977,"While my playtime isn't high yet, I've watched hundreds of videos and I am addicted"
11978,Fun Game Play It
11979,play this game rn.
11980,Amazing
11981,this game so realistic i can waste the entire day doing nothing and then get surprised when it's already nighttime

11989,abigail got the best stardussy HANDS DOWN
11990,"Really reminds me of the old Harvest Moon games, 10/10 would recommend!!"
11991,stardew valley is not a game. it is a lifestyle. it will consume you and ruin your life. you will play for 12 hours straight until all you can see is pixels around you.
11992,selling my soul to this
11993,Amazing and relaxing game it’s super fun solo but with friends it’s possibly the most fun you will ever have.

11997,"I LOVE this game, but I wish to know how to download the mods I want for it that won't fight and crash my game ^^"
11998,"The story is really nice and exploring the world of Stardew Valley is so cool. Characters are all pretty great, except Morris of course, no one likes him."
11999,literally moving to pelican town don't @ me
12000,Nice
12001,good game i suppose
12002,"yes very good
"
12003,"good game ;D
"
12004,Foda pra jogar multiplayer
12005,"This game is for everyone it has a bit of everything it has replay, forging and some fighting it is so much fun I could play this for days."
12006,"꧁As a person who has obviously played for years, i wanna say a personal thank you to Eric Barone for creating such a beautiful game. (Hope he reads this!) I highly recommend this game, and most of my friends online have also bought it upon my recommendation. The game is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE. ꧂

꧁ If you are thinking about buying this game just do it you wont be disappointed as its overwhelmingly positive for a reason.  Abigail and Maru are my absolute favorite characters in it. I'm hoping in the future Eric will expand upon the wizard and the witch's story line.. and bring some alchemy into this game as i think it would be a fun addition. Eric are you reading this? lol ꧂

                                                            ♡🍒♡🍒♡🍒♡KissMyCherry♡🍒♡🍒♡🍒♡"
12007,so cute
12008,Yes. Idk who wouldn't like this game. Playing on the PC is the best experience because if you get bored with vanilla there are so many mods to customize your experience.
12009,"The 1000+ hours should speak for itself. Great replay value, vibrant-ish modding community, amazing multiplayer function.  Not combat heavy but the story is amazing!"
12010,"If you haven't played this game before, I don't know what you're doing with your life."
12011," Very fun, simple, and obviously relaxing game 9/10"
12012,my 6 children can't eat the digintal patatos
12013,really good game with friends
12014,"I've played a lot of farming games, and none of them have the same depth or re-playability that Stardew has. My favorite game ever, hands down!"
12015,so epic and fun and cozy im gonna scream
12016,best game ever stright up
12017,very full game
12018,"Very relaxing, yet filled with interesting and complex game mechanics, many secrets, and I love the NPC interactions"
12019,:)
12020,I could not stop playing this game. Too good
12021,nice calming game
12022,very similar to terraria but instead of killing gods you marry men
12023,Very cute and cozy
12024,it's for sure one of my favorite games. I play it some much. definitely something I suggest to all my friends who are looking for something new to play.
12025,"Good Game Get It 
"
12026,this game is fun
12027,Very Fun
12028,"This is quite possibly one of the greatest games of the 2010s, if not all time. Not only is there an insane amount of content available, but the developer has consistently added updates of new stuff to play with, including multiplayer and a lengthy post-game.

You play as a farmer who has inherited your grandfather's land in the small town of Stardew Valley. However, farming is not the only thing available. There is dungeon exploring, fishing, foraging, and a town of people whom you can befriend and eventually marry. Fans of games like Animal Crossing, Slime Rancher, Farming Simulator, and most of all, Harvest Moon, will love this game. There is a little bit for everyone available, all for an affordable price."
12029,"Great for players who are completionist types. There are tons of different parts of the game that require time, effort, and puzzle solving. when you complete one set/bundle/friendship/skill, there is ALWAYS something new to collect/earn/farm/mine.... The list goes on and on! Co-op version is also fun to play, as you can get more done with a partner, as long as the partner you choose to play with isn't insane and names all the chickens MURDER and dig through trash in front of ALL THE TOWNSFOLK. Shout out to my brother, Psycho Pete."
12030,"i got this game 4 days ago and already have 50 hours in it
i need serious help
anyway, time to do some fishing"
12031,laid back chill game for solo or even co-op upto 4 players.
12032,cute game :)
12033,Amazing game
12034,krobus <3
12035,very fun coop
12036,THIS GAME IS SICK! i know i don't have too many hours on it but i only got it yesterday so...
12037,"I had a fictional kid with a fictional character only to have a change of heart and want to be room mates with a crow who lived in a sewer. Best decision I ever made. 





Weezer."
12038,Boring
12039,"cute game, fun with friends, retro graphics, but modern feel to it."
12040,best game in existance
12041,very fun game i reccomend it to everyone
12042,Good. Yes?
12043,"farm good
"
12044,i want to give shane the gluzziest glizzy 3000 that he's ever experienced.
12045,I love farming.
12046,"Game Is very Good And Beeg, Lot's of content and fun"
12047,"Good. Get it. If you are wondering if you are going to like it bc it looks like a farming sim, get it, you will like it.

Only thing, I like to go into games blind and not knowing much, and while you should definitely avoid spoilers at all costs, you definitely look up a beginning guide, or tips and tricks because I realized when I started playing co-op with a more experienced friend that I was playing the game completely wrong."
12048,The game is fun and it allows for the player to have a lot of freedom in creating and running their farm. 10/10
12049,I don't actually need to write a review to explain right?
12050,"Helped me to fixed my life 🙏✨

12062,"base game is great and you can see the creator actually enjoys his game. If you ""beat"" the game there are SO many awesome mods by wonderful modders that makes your second, third or even 100th play through even better and different in almost every way! I 100% recommend this game to new players and i hope yall enjoy it as much as i did and still do!"

12067,"Very fun game, except Clint


I’m going to CURB STOMP Clint"
12068,"I don't have enough nice things to say about this game. I grew up with Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing, and Stardew Valley is worlds better. The defining and inarguable pinnacle of the genre, to me. Top-10 game all time territory."
12069,Relaxing game. Enjoying it.
12070,"I spent every day for a while building up friendship points with emily. I finally marry her, i hate her, i divorce her. Emily mad, me happy. 10/10 game"
12071,Everybody is ugly
12072,This game is super relaxing and fun. It can legit suck me in for hours at a time. I would highly recommend this game for those who like Minecraft or Terraria. And especially if you like farming games!
12073,Just play it homie
12074,Best indie game developed! Super catchy for gamers or non-gamers :)
12075,"nice game
"
12076,"started playing for a mod that replaces the wizard with emet-selch from FFXIV and makes him romanceable, stayed for the genuinely addicting and delightful gameplay! 10/10 couldnt possibly recommend more, best purchase ive ever made on steam!"

12082,"Peaceful game 6.9 hours of gameplay through and let me tell you just kinda vibing
just recently figured out that getting exhausted makes you gain less energy when waking up so dont get too tired before sleeping

all in all check someone elses review probably
might redo my review later idk"
12083,"Have paid over $50,000 in doctor's bills for passing out. Not enough time in the day. 12/10 would pass out again."
12084,Most worthy farming game.
12085,"Really fun, this game is really growing on me!! totally get this game its worth it"
12086,yes
12087,"This is easily one of the best games I've ever played in my life, it has so much for you to do but it's all optional. The game never forces you to do anything, and that's what I love about it. You can pick your own path and do whatever your heart desires. I absolutely love this game, I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a new game to play :)"
12088,"Don't get this game if you want to play Multiplayer. 
You keep getting disconnected every 2-5mins for the rest of you and your farming partner's experience. 
The worse part of being disconnected is when you reconnect, you will be forced back into your cabin/house. 
This is especially disappointing when you get disconnected halfway through an event. 

Googled for ways to fix disconnecting issues, but none of the solutions fixed the problem, and no one in the community/forums have a ""definite"" answer as to how to fix the connection issues.
Game was fine at first, and it was fun. The amount of times I disconnected at the beginning was 1hour at least 2 times. 
But as you progress further into the game, you get disconnected more and more often that the game becomes unplayable. 

Hope this is fixed soon, else don't buy this game if you're playing it just to play multiplayer."
12089,great waste of time
12090,"I never thought I could love a game so much in my 30""s."
12091,10/10 for chill gaming
12092,I find this game very calming and so much fun. It's even better if you play it with friends
12093,"I started playing May 26 2022, and it is now July 2 2022, and I already have over 125 hours in the game. If that doesn't tell you I love this game, I don't know what will. I jumped in headfirst after a friend recommended it to me, and oh my lawd I love it. There's so much to do, and honestly the fact that you just have to figure stuff out as you go is something I enjoy a lot. If there's ever something I need help on, all of the forums and such are always so willing to help. This game is great and has an amazing community."
12094,Minecraft + Terraria 8/10
12095,chillin
12096,Yes its a really fun an addicting game i've only had it for 3 days and i'm already almost to 40 hours
12097,Recommend and the new update with the island is a great free thing to get. I would look at stardew valley expanded on Nexus as well.
12098,"suuuuppper relaxing, also hot emo man, 10/10 game"

12109,it's not bad
12110,GO. Be a farmer.
12111,I have almost 500 hours on a farming game. I think that speaks for itself.
12112,"A good simple game, it will give you content for at least 50 hours :>"
12113,Great game
12114,"I love escaping the non-awesomeness of city life and choosing the delectable, splendourous, and often yummy yummy farm life!! :]

"
12115,This is one of THE best games I have ever played in my liiife
12116,"Absolutely a great game if you like to farm, raise animals, mining and etc. If you liked the Old Lovely Harvest Moon, you will definitely like Stardew Valley. When I play Stardew, i personally don't notice the passage of time cuz i only enjoy the content that there is in the game. Definitely recommend it if you want to chill and have a good time with ur friends."
12117,If you love life simulator games that have a similar feel to harvest moon this game is a must. The fact that they update this game with a major update that adds something new to the game about once a year helps too.
12118,"I love this game! It is so cute and wholesome, but it has it's sad and serious moments too. There's so much more than what meets the eye and honestly this can keep you busy for hours!"
12119,mmmm egg
12120,Best game i've played in my life.

12135,"Very Fun with friends, Very fun alone, Rate it"
12136,yes
12137,I love this game is so fun the music is good too and i am very proud of this creator for making this awesome game
12138,fun
12139,good.
12140,"Best game ever, I'm 160 hours in and am still not bored :). It's got really great interactive characters, and I really enjoy the plot-line."
12141,"I grew up a huge fan of Harvest Moon Back To Nature.  At first Stardew Valley felt like a sequel.  After years of playing Stardew Valley is without a dbout a far superior version that has made all farming simulators including the Harvest Moon series obsolete.  Stardew Valley has been there to help through depression, financial troubles, heartaches, and most important loneliness.  It's unreal to learn that there was only one person who created this game.  What vision, talent, simply a masterpiece.  Definitely one of the greatest video games ever created."
12142,"It's just a cute, cozy game that you can play your way. If you want combat, go to the mines. Crafting, collecting? Go foraging. Just want to farm? That's dope too. There's just enough guidance to give some direction, but no punishments (as such) if you don't ""do it all"" by the ""right"" time- first year, third year, whatever. It's cute, it's chill, I love this game and own it on multiple platforms. Playing on Steam especially rocks because of the ability to add mods to enhance gameplay as you see fit."

12149,"Too much text, too much walking, meh."
12150,"Stardew Valley is a one-of-a-kind true masterpiece of a game that totally sucks you in as soon as you take your first step. There's so many things to do because the sheer amount of content and replayability is absurd. I've been playing for years and on multiple platforms, and have made so many memories whether it be alone or with friends. It's both fun and addicting, and usually a chill game but can get intense when you want it to be. Also, need I mention ConcernedApe being an absolute legend for making this labor of love by himself with so much dedication and passion, not to mention the price of the game itself and the free updates that we receive. Genuinely a 10/10 game for me."
12151,gay shane
12152,Nostalgic Harvest Moon type vibes 10/10
12153,Dude this game is like when you go to play a good game of fortnite BUT its actually a farming sim with tomatos and fish. good game (:

12169,Awesome game
12170,"Been playing in mobile for a year now and I still have a lot to discover. Until now, it has been my go-to for de-stressing and guilt-free leisure. Concerned ape's game creation is inspiring, same as the in-game character stories. Been hooked with SDV wiki and SDV youtube streamers. Even joined FB SDV groups. Plus, with only one time payment, the succeeding updates are free with no hidden in-app purchase. Makes you want to support the developer more. I can delete all my games and have this one only. Super thank you Concerned Ape, can't imagine living a different generation without Stardew Valley! :)"

12182,"Great game, you can become a Millionaire off of pumpkin juice."
12183,Great game! Got addicted super fast.
12184,one of my favorites
12185,"I played this game on 3 different platforms (Playstation, Switch, and PC), and would absolutely recommend this game to anyone. It has something to offer for everyone, from the miner and fighter type to the domestic farmer, Stardew has nearly endless content for anyone. Even if you aren't interested in developing a romantic relationship with the various bachelors and bachelorettes, there's still hundreds of hours of content for players."
12186,"10/10 hands down the best game i've ever played, amazing replayability, tons of things to do, very cute and wholesome, i love it"
12187,it's fun
12188,"Stardew Valley is a great game (although I am only 14 hours in while I am writing this). I love the ways you can interact with the people of Pelican Town, slowly developing friendships while helping your town grow and evolve through work in the community center and your farm. I hope to update this review as I go along but I may well forget I wrote this in the first place and never come back. We shall see."
12189,Best Game Everrrrrr
12190,good
12191,Love this game and the variety of ways it allows you to make profit to expand and grow.
12192,"its a relaxing game to play and a lot of fun
"
12193,EPIC but crashes
12194,First I used to play this game one every blue moon before I decided to pick it up again. In th past 2 weeks I've gotten 61.9 hours on it help when does it end
12195," This is a wonderful, mostly chill game start to finish.  Relatively bug free with minor quirks.  Easy to pick up, no in your face tutorial, plenty left to discover on your own.  The in-game days give decent time to accomplish multiple tasks.  End-game challenges seem imposing but are not impossible, even for casual gamers.  

The visuals are pleasant, music is endearing (and not on constant loop), and characters involved all have their own distinguishable traits to be memorable.

I own this game on Steam and on Xbox and have played both approximately 500 hours each.  I've started up new games with personal goals in mind.  Needless to say, I really enjoy this game.

I, and many others, highly recommend this for all ages."
12196,I dislike that it's not cross-platform.
12197,Super cool game. Don't let the look of the game fool you. It's not boring at all. Really nice to kick back and relax while playing.
12198,I have no life
12199,straight fire game
12200,non-stressful great way to spend you time
12201,"This is one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life! I feel connected to everyone and really feel like i'm part of the town. If you have Anxiety this is the game for you, best 15 dollars I have ever spent."
12202,"Super relaxing game. 
Now these types of games comme with a buttload of microtransaction. 
Farm, minigame and community simulator."
12203,i cant stop playing
12204,chill game
12205,slay
12206,"i first played it on the time limited demo version on the nintendo switch recently, and it has been a lot of fun. The game exceeded all my expectations in terms of gameplay, there is so much fun, relaxation and satisfaction to be experienced. I bought the game here on steam because there was a summer sale going on. 
Highly recommend it"

12224,"I absolutely love this game, would highly recommend"
12225,"Controls suck, boring interactions, there are other games that do the whole chill out and build up a farm vibe better.  Maybe it gets more fun if you put like a month of your life into it, but who has that kind of time?  They have played us for absolute fools."

12241,"Stardew Valley is a pretty relaxing game (unless you consider the arcade games in the Saloon), and it gives you freedom to do whatever you want while also giving you overall goals to keep you going.

I've played 100+ hours on the PS4 so I got back into it thanks to the Steam Summer Sale.
Very good game, 10/10!"
12242,Stardew Valley is a very rich game not for all but for people who like to feel liek they are in a different reality when they play games if that's you this game will be your favorite game
12243,"I used to hate this game, then loved the farming and rpg aspects but hated the social part and now love the game fully"

12246,yes
12247,"I am a 41 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
12248,I think this game is alright. I would buy it again. In fact I did for my girlfriend. The motherfucking shortness of every day pisses me off to no end.
12249,takes me back to the old days playing harvest moon 64

12281,More cozy community-building vibes!
12282,I have played this more than I have seen or visited my family in the last few years and I would do it all over again
12283,VERY CUTE AND FUN
12284,good game
12285,"If you enjoy games like Harvest Moon/ Story of Seasons, this is for you! It is a game that will keep you occupied for many hours. I mainly play it on my switsch but enjoy the PC version just as much."
12286,it's perfect escapism from the reality we are all forced in
12287,"Bought this about eight years ago in a humble bundle, didn’t really click with it. My fiancée’s twitch friends started playing it two years ago, and I told her I already had it. She told me to shut it and bought it on switch, where she’s put about 1500 hours into it. We got married the week I’m writing this, and when we got home the next day, said she wanted to try it on PC for the expanded mod. In the three days since, she’s put in 24 hours of play time and is refusing to come to bed at night. 
Stardew might ruin my marriage, but it’s a damn good life sim if you’re into those, or like Animal Crossing but want a more involved and varied gameplay experience."
12288,"i love this game and i will love it even more when 1.6 comes out 
"
12289,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104"
12290,An incredibly relaxing game with surprisingly in depth characters. Highly recommend.

12306,Good Game
12307,Potato
12308,"A fun game to play alone or with friends.

The farming mechanics are sound, combat can be a bit tedious at first, but you quickly get used to it. Decorating your farm is also loads of fun. 

Be sure to enable the tool hitbox in the settings however, or you'll misclick so many times."
12309,"I have played 56 hours in the past week, i highly recommend"
12310,i just want harvey to love me
12311,Such a cute and beautiful game. Do not be discouraged by your lack of money at first. I was a bit disappointed by the sum of money I would receive at the end of the day but after a while and constant work being done you finally earn a lot. Fishing is a good way to earn a lot of money at first. 100% recommend this game if you are doubting it :). If you like Minecraft and Terraria then you would like this game.
12312,good
12313,This game has no right to be as good as it actually is
12314,very fun and relaxing. like a cross between terraria and animal crossing. didn't realize i had 15 hours on it already
12315,it`s amazing <3
12316,Good game nod nod
12317,"Got depression? Grow vegetable

12320,"It's amazing, honestly."
12321,"Really charming, relaxing and fun in single-player, and even more with your friends."
12322,11/10! :3
12323,DO NOT EVER TELL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT THIS GAME MAKES SURE THEY NEVER HEAR OF THIS GAME PLZ
12324,It is a lot of fun to play but I would suggest having friends to play with it makes it more fun.
12325,"Amazing game! Super cute, multiplayer, and I learn new things every time I play"
12326,yes
12327,copium
12328,Honestly when i first saw the game on youtube didn't like it but i gave it a second chance and now i have 200 hours on mobile and another 100 here. I totally recomend this game to everyone who wants to try something new.
12329,My favourite game!
12330,"awesome game, lots to do and fun with multiplayer"
12331,Niceee game
12332,it's like therapy except it's a hundred times cheaper
12333,"Great game for such a low price that i can easily sink hundreds of hours into without realising it, 10/10"
12334,"Stardew Valley is a great game to just chill and play it, u can determine your own speed of progress. I would really recommend it because of the calming, nice music that the game has and a friendly environment. There are a lot of features and locations in the game which creates a varying location."
12335,Kalergi plan
12336,yes
12337,There's really nothing to be said that hasn't already been said. Just buy the dang game!
12338,Good stuff
12339,pretty good
12340,"So addictive, seeing that massive cash influx after harvest gives me a hard on. Great game, super cute, funny, sad, thought-provoking."
12341,"50 hours for everything; if we consider the price of it, yeah it deserves"
12342,fishing
12343,This great game got me addicted.
12344,"What do you want from me? It's Stardew Valley, of course it's good. There's a reason this is THE farming simulator."
12345,nothing beats this game! the simplicity and just the vibes is off the charts.
12346,good
12347,"This game, it transcends the word 'aight' which I have used so much in my previous reviews. This game, no, this MASTERPIECE can only be given a new, greater word for its description. I hereby grant this work of art an 'aight²'."
12348,"Most reasonable games I ever bought!
"
12349,"While i do enjoy the game their is this continuing issue where the game will crash while going to sleep and saving, this has happened a few times and each time i have lost all my progress. It has happened around 6 times now, i want to be able to keep playing but i don't think i can if this continues"
12350,This game is so good and relaxaxing
12351,"I think I must have started a new game 10 times already over the past years. On paper it seems amazing and everything I ever wanted, but for some reason, I just can't get into the game at all. I guess it's just not for me after all."
12352,im addicted and nobody can stop me now
12353,christ how is chop plant farm game so addicting
12354,"If you want to play a game that makes you feel like you aren't just procrastinating, this is the way to do it. 10/10"
12355,"WOW This Game Is Amazing! Im So Happy I Got This When I Did, Really Relaxing Gameplay, With Great Npc's, And Lots Of Stuff To Do!"
12356,"I HEAVILY recommend. It's one of those games you can play for hours and hours without realizing. There's so much you can do, you're constantly busy. Whether you're clearing out forests, mining for ores, completing tasks, or charming a villager. Its so fun and I will probably play for months!!"
12357,"super cute
"
12358,fun game
12359,"HARVEY YOU IDIOT WHERE ARE YOU, I WANNA GIVE YOU THE CAVE CARRRRROTTTTTTTTTTTTT

12361,whippa on the trap
12362,i love me my emo boy
12363,"fun to grind on. love the laid back play style. low risk, low stress. calming and engaging"
12364,Such a nice game just to casually play. Plus it has lots of content to keep you busy.
12365,Good
12366,You should be able to do more with your spouse in this game.  Like a walk at night or maybe some kind of board game.  That would probably bring more immersion.
12367,"This game is NOT BAD, Its a MASTERPEICE the farming the animals the processing quests friendship multiplayer i could go on for years! If you like farming and generally mostly chill games Stardew Valley is for you!"
12368,shit
12369,"Awesome story, great for friends to play together :D"
12370,You can fish 10/10
12371,An amazing chill game to lose hours of your life playing.
12372,"once you start you will get addicted. Really good game, there's a lot you can do so you'll never get bored!"
12373,This game is for brain relaxation.
12374,Amazeing game!
12375,I'm addicted
12376,"I have played Stardew on my laptop and Xbox, and it has been the most calming yet intriguing game I have played to date! The characters' dialogue is enjoyable, the events are great, and there is always something to do. I can easily play this game for hours on end lol! One thing to keep in mind before purchasing is that it is a bit confusing to start playing, especially on Xbox. It took me a good hour or so to learn to play on the Xbox ; Laptop took me a good 15. Other than that, I have no complaints. Peace and love to those reading!  :) <3"
12377,i can't fish but yey farm
12378,wormg
12379,Harvy is the best. Its awesome
12380,This game has been a total blast! It's a lovely cozy game I recommend everyone gives a go if you just wanna wind down and have a nice time! The story is lovely and the characters are great! The world it's self is beautiful and great to explore! I own it on my switch as well and have put well over 100 hours in it.
12381,The farm
12382,haha funny chimken
12383,trdf
12384,Very cool and laid back game
12385,ye
12386,I like that its an adventure farming game that no matter how much i play there's always new things to learn about the game.
12387,"Would highly recommend picking up this game. Find it to be relaxing. 

It also has fishing, so 10/10"
12388,i love fact thet you can move up your home levr
12389,"relaxing and enjoyable
Just do what you want to do"
12390,"I'm amazed at the flexibility and creativity built into this game. There's a seemingly infinite number of things to do, and seemingly all the time, yet hardly any time, to do them. It's not a farm sim (but it is), it's a deep and challenging RPG that is both compact and limitless at the same time. This game really surprised me, and I find myself saying ""just one more day then I'll quit"" far too often."
12391,yes
12392,It's like minecraft... but with circles
12393,"very fun to play, especially with friends"
12394,"i like game
"
12395,DIS GAME SUPER GUD! I am in love with Harvey.
12396,10/10 highly recommend. I have spent upwards of 50 hours in a single week on this game and I wouldn't have it any other way.
12397,LOVED THIS U SHOULD TOTALLY GET IT!!!!
12398,emily best girl
12399,"I've sank hundreds of hours into this game, I come back to it often and I've been looking for games like it ever since :( it's like a lover I can't let go of"
12400,I love stardew valley. I have easily logged over 100 hours on my phone but am playing laptop to get ginger island.
12401,My girlfriend got me addicted to this game and now we both sleep in the same bed and kiss Shane goodnight on his little forehead as he questions why the fuck there's two people in his bed and he's only married to one of them. Packaged deal.
12402,good game
12403,it is a fun and relaxing game can also be very addicting
12404,good game
12405,"If I never leave my house again, you know what I'm doing"
12406,grow stuff and kill some things. 10/10
12407,Very relaxing game and is reminiscent of the Harvest Moon series. Haley best girl.
12408,sux
12409,For those who enjoy a simple grinding simulator that is also very zen inducing
12410,"Game got me laid, so solid experience."
12411,i like it yes
12412,good
12413,great game me a farmer boy thats why
12414,"Stop looking at reviews and just buy it already.

Probably the only game I've ever purchased on multiple platforms - and definitely the only one I've purchased more than twice.

PC, PS4, Switch (x2), and iOS. 

I regret *nothing*"
12415,"I like the game because it's a nice little laid back game with several different modes of activity like spelunking, farming, and adventure. It doesn't require time-in-game, you can play when you like. It's a lot of relaxed fun."
12416,"this game has taken over my life, my chickens own me now."
12417,i framed john wilkes booth
12418,Crazy depth i barely scratched the top because i have adhd and boy howdy it really is man something really. Best part is the fishing oh uyeahs buddy
12419,Fun
12420,"I love this game! I can't seem to get enough, even almost perfecting the game I still find more things to do, and just enjoy running a farm! Vanilla or modded this game is tons of fun!"
12421,"Game good, I like. <3"
12422,fuck pierre
12423,This game got me through my depression. I can never say enough good things about this game
12424,"Quaint. Excellent story. Great characters. Perfect music. 

It's a great game."
12425,farmb . . . . .

12428,music man and alcoholic <3
12429,"Its a time consuming frenzy, but i love it!"
12430,"Obsessed with this game, will play for hours on end without realizing it. Love my alcoholic husband"
12431,I seriously love this game! I have anxiety and this game is the perfect one to be cozy with. Highly reccomend
12432,simply wonderful.
12433,yay
12434,"It's a very stressful game sometimes. BUT, thats because there is so much to do!"
12435,Certified hood classic
12436,"It seems like a boring game at first glance, just a ""farming simulator"" its much MUCH more than that, somehow you'll spend 5+ more hours a day playing it and it'll feel like 3 minutes. if you want a more laid back game to just relax this is the one for you."
12437,Quite fun. worth buying if someone else gifts it to you
12438,is good game
12439,"This is the most wonderful game ever created.  For years I've happily fished, farmed, mined, and wooed the townsfolk for hundreds of hours on my Playstation and Switch. 
Playing Stardew Valley is like being in the sun on a summer day, you feel warm and content. You can get lost in it. Just hearing the music brings a smile to my face and I don't smile that often. It's truly magical. You'll lose hour after hour thinking ""I'll play just one more day and then I'll stop.""
Thank you so much to Concerned Ape for all the joy this game had brought me. I'll be playing this one for the rest of my life."
12440,"Amazing game would recc 10/10 for people to try. It's a cute farming sim where you have around 15 minutes to do something in a day while you talk to the villagers and build your farm.
Currently on 2nd run (after a 4 yr farm+small co op worlds) to try remix bundles, still love it <33"
12441,"Without doubt, the best farming game ever created. It's a love letter from the world's biggest fan of the genre."
12442,"Beautiful scenery and plot line, intricate relationships and attention to every detail."
12443,fishing
12444,goot farmer gam

12450,PEW PEW FARMING
12451,"An awesome game, really. I have it both on Xbox and Steam and I'm addicted. That says alot since I normally don't play or have time to play video games, but this, I give this game most of my time"
12452,"My favorite game of all time!! I can't recommend SV highly enough, everyone should play it"
12453,"i like the game play, always so calming and fun!

12457,"grobus go brrrrrr

"
12458,good
12459,"I am a 40 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 13 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
12460,"

Game looks great!Good mechanics good lore.Also very cheap.This was my first time playing a pixelated game so i did not know if it was for me.I tried it and didn't like it.In the end main i reason i disliked the game is because i do not like pixel games .If u do like pixel games this game is for you if you don t no matter how good this game is you will not like it.You might love sports but u might not like basketball.

To make it clear pixel game is not just the display of the game.
Lots of reading if you want to do choices and understand story and playing in small areas which u can leave by going to furthest point and you will enter a new area.

I do not want to make it too long and take your time.
Have a nice day everyone."
12461,great game so addicting and fun it gave me a little more appreciation for farming overall fun game
12462,good game
12463,This game was like a theraphy for me. I've had such fun playing it. I especially love how detailed it is in every way. I recommend it for everyone who needs a game to relax.
12464,:D
12465,farm game

12472,"Do you enjoy the old harvest moon games? 
Do you enjoy sitting down to play a video game for an hour but then realizing that its 3 in the morning?
Do you enjoy being able to efficiently manage your time and organize things (in game)?
Do you enjoy there always being some fun new thing to discover and play the game again?
Do you enjoy great deals?
Do you enjoy enjoyment? 
Then get Stardew Valley."
12473,"One of, if not, the best games I've ever played. I only have a few minor gripes that are easily fixed with mods :)"

12475,it makes me feel less lonely
12476,"it makes your friends turn into pixel girlfriend addicts

no life/128"
12477,"Stardew Valley is a game of endless possibilities in a confined, yet freeing world. As someone who normally plays singleplayer games with set objectives or competitive multiplayer games, it is very refreshing to throw away structure to grow crops, explore underground, fish, or interact with the NPCs in an immersive world. The NPCs, although limited in day to day dialogue, do not feel fake or unrealistic. Instead they feel like real people, everyone has their likes and dislikes, each has their own problems. (I.e alcoholism, depression, etc.) Through your actions, such as giving gifts, you learn more about the townsfolk and become friends with them. Eventually you can sometimes even help them with their problems, or increase friendship by doing tasks submitted to the community bulletin board. In short Stardew Valley is a sandbox game against the normals of gaming in the best ways possible. instead of fast paced competitive gameplay, Stardew Valley slows things down to let you enjoy your time doing the simplest things."
12478,Its a good game
12479,Stardew is the ultimate comfort game. I log on whenever I'm feeling stressed and the calming environment and interesting story that players get to unfold always helps to make me feel better.
12480,Marijuana farm
12481,fun time when you trick a friend into watering your plants every day.
12482,Great calm game
12483,Super fun and relaxing! Great way to take your mind off the current state of the world and live in your own little space.
12484,It's a really fun game. My only complain is the controls are kinda awkward sometimes while playing with a controller.
12485,"I love how you have so many options to choose from and the way that it looks so simple yet has so many details, like dialogue advancing as you become better friends with people."

This game is a gem to play, it's relaxing and has great music, as well as fabulous audio design. The relationships and story you get through interacting with villagers of Pelican Town is fed to you gradually, and you will have to be in it for the long run in order to get everyone's individual stories as well as your own, so if you don't want to spend hours on end for this, then I would be wary about that. (At the time of me playing, I haven't finished the story but I am enjoying everything I have discovered so far!) 

My favourite thing about this game is the animals you get to take care of, and your own little pet after 10 days, which if like me you chose a cat, you can walk home to your little buddy curled up on your bed which is  always adorable. The addition of Co-op to the PC version is also very fun, I've found my time spent more playing with my friends on this game than I have alone, and there is a lot of potential to work together on quests and other activities such as mining and fighting. 

The added addition of mods does make some of the gameplay slightly better, such as the NPC locations on the map or faster walking speed, which means that you can get even more done over a day and not have to walk around trying to find out where someone you need is, but this is just for me personally, you may like that sort of thing! 

Overall, I wholly recommend this game to anyone and everyone, I'm sure there is something that you would enjoy, from the mining and fighting to the fishing and farming, there is really something for everyone, especially when you play together 
"
12487,"You know this game is honestly great- has nice pixel sprites and cute houses with also cute concept of a farm, visuals are great too with a range of 4 seasons throughout the year and whenever it's on sale (which is pretty often) you can decently snag it up with 9 bucks ez clap and then have a nice farm sim game. 

You can do a lot of things with the farm sim alone- fishing, caring for animals ranging from pigs, chicken, cows, sheep, and ducks while also being able to produce multiple stuff with the items they produce daily increasing their happiness will also add to the quality and item they produce, farm a wide variety of crops depending on season which I find quite neat, produce goods like wine, cheese, clothes etc- you can also go mining and fight off monster rpg style.

Not to mention the town events and seasonal festival which offers games and limited item shop, and you also get to help the community. 

The story part of this game is also pretty well built we got the nice little town with nice community and magical lore stuff- as well as the joji mart which is trying to take over the town- and guess what? You get to choose that, thats right you get to choose which fate this town ends up in, its all in your hand you're god now- yea thats for the god complex people but anyhow there's quite a few route you can take with the story which is neat, in addition to multiple side route and cool little cutscenes that comes from interacting with certain characters. 

And- wait for it... 

Do you want a girlfriend/boyfriend? Yes you, do you wanna date pixels?! Well look no further with stardew valley's selection of bachelors and bachelorettes you can certainly find a men/women that fits into your taste in romantic partner so what are you waiting for?"

12490,"Dang, this game is the best, you can marry someone, you can date someone, you can see the cutscenes and most of all, you can farm and mine, I recommend you playing this game."
12491,This Game is so f*cking perfect I love it!

12511,"Listen, I never used to like these kinda farming games or whatever.
But this game is so chill. It is so fun, and so well made.
If you're tired of monotonous Animal Crossing or other village life games then play this.
If you wanna relax and have a fun, light hearted time, play this game.
You can put as little or as many hours as you want, but you might get hooked to this game anyways and do loads of hours. (I have a lot on Steam and Switch combined)"
12512,"If there is 1 game that I would recommend for literally everyone. It is absolutely this. Easy to navigate, easy game mechanics, peaceful, no DLC fiddling. A classic piece of gaming history for sure. Highly recommend!"

12530,It's such a simple but enjoyable game...time flies and the whole mechanics of the games are pretty nice and you can do a lot in this game! You actually have lots of options in what you want to accomplish so it's superrrr fun! I would def recommend it to anyone who is interested!
12531,"I mean... You get to take care of your farm and date, what else would you want?"
12532,Such a cute little farming sim! It's very relaxing and fun :)
12533,"Fun game, don't talk to Haley or Shane though"
12534,"One of my favorite games. I've played over 200 hours across platforms. It has a very unique and charming style and sense of humor. Lots of content, even in late game. It feels very busy and “alive”, with a large cast of interesting characters and lots of unique world events. Very replayable with many different character and farm builds to try and choices to make. A bit addictive, every time I come back to it I end up playing it all day for a week or more lol. It’s often compared to the Harvest Moon series, I would say it’s also like a mix of ACNL and classic Sierra games."
12535,"Really fun, sometimes confusing but you get used tp the layout really fast"
12536,It's a great game and if you haven't played it yet -- you should!

12565,Farm is life
12566,if you need to release tilt and just want to relax. this is the game
12567,Winter got me buyin clothes
12568,"It's such a cute game with very nice characters. If you befriend the villagers, they give you nice tips and you get to know some awesome background story. You can also decide, what you really want to do. Be a farmer, miner or just have fun with some animals! 
I personally think that it's easier to play in multiplayer mode since you can devide tasks but if you don't have anyone to play with or have a depressing day, it is a nice way to cheer yourself up! Stop with alcoholism and play stardew valley lol?"
12569,cheese
12570,I like that I get to talk to girls. I can't do that in real life. If you also can't talk to girls in real life this is a great game for you. There's even an emo one. Also chickens are cool.
12571,Very fun
12572,"You would think a game like this would eventually devolve into a repetitive, boring ball of disappointment, but it doesn't. Instead, you continue to find more and more motivation to play in building relationships, advancing your farm, leveling up, exploring new areas, or even adding mods (which are super easy to get). I've played almost entirely with my IRL gf and it has been relaxing and enjoyable all the way through. I do not know if there is a single person I wouldn't recommend this game to."
12573,cute and fun
12574,noice

12576,"This game is so much fun, I have waisted so much time on it and it's definitely worth the money!"
12577,it gud
12578,I love this game so much!! It is my favorite cozy game and I always find new things to do.
12579,"If you haven't played or seen this game before then I really think you should try it, it's truly excellent and very wholesome."
12580,Best game for though who like to play casually with friends or by yourself. worth the purchase
12581,best simulation
12582,"Helps anxiety and super fun!! It can become quite the ""competitive grind"" by yourself or with friends if you want it to be! 100/10 recommend. I have put in 65 hours in just exactly 5 days of playing and owning it; it's addictive af."
12583,Absolutely love this game as a wind down after a long day. There's plenty to do and heaps of customisation once you figure it all out. Although it's repetitious its still engaging and fun. 10/10 would recommend; only thing i'd like to see added in the future is potentially farm hands you can hire or the ability to upgrade the size of a farm/ bring in more players to help instead of the cap being at 4.
12584,leah is very hot.
12585,"I grow plants yes
"
12586,gets kinda boring by yourself after a while but its a blast with friends. think animal crossing but humans and none of them are insanely annoying.
12587,One of  the best Farm  Simulator Games :)
12588,"something about this game just really does it for me. i just like being a silly farmer and planting my silly little crops with the silly little townspeople. also, the cutscenes where you get to hang out with the town/help them with their struggles and insecurities is really heartwarming to me <3. really fun and addicting in the best ways!!"
12589,fun to play with bf :D add sex
12590,Game is meant to make me happy not make me sad about a town
12591,Yes
12592,"I really enjoy this game as it has everything that I had hoped for if not more when I bought this game. There is really emerging content that lies within this game. You can even play in a coop with your friends, creating many funny and enjoyable moments among yourselves. I would give this game a 11/10 if there was a rating system. I would highly recommend getting this game and trying it for yourself."
12593,Wholesome
12594,"Love this game in almost every aspect. Clearly with the amount of hours I have on it proves that much haha. The game is not very story driven which leaves pretty much everything in your hands. The events are well scripted and there are both challenging and easy parts to the game. Like most of the Stardew Valley community ... I hate the fishing mechanic. Regardless, 10/10."
12595,"Great game, going for Shane, I don't know, he just seems fun."
12596,ive learned just give women what they want dont make a mistake and you get laid

12607,"It is one of my favorite games because of all of the cute animals and also its in-depth, round characters."
12608,what can i say about this game that hasnt been said already?
12609,I play with a wireless controller and its an easy enough set up I could get lost in this game if not to careful.
12610,"Stardew Valley is a very relaxing game to play and there's a lot of lore to discover not only about your own character, but the world, town, and residents as well! There are lots of different skills you can develop in the game, so there really is something for everyone! Overall I really like the game, and I think others would it too."

12627,its cute
12628,Great game overall. Very relaxing.
12629,"A very easy to learn and enjoyable game. Plenty of content to keep you busy and allow you to play the way you enjoy most. Even after doing that to your hearts content, there is a wonderful selection of mods to expand and improve the game as whole. Though I may not play this game all the time, I can easily come back to it at any point and continue to enjoy it. Would most definitely recommend to anyone."

It's a cutthroat world of which one of us can get this beautiful man a fish fastest to win his heart... and chill on a farm. We live our lives like a rom-com and it's beautiful.

12641,"Overwhelming at first (especially if you look it up), but very addictive once you get the hang of it. Note: Wiki is your best friend here."
12642,"It is a pretty cute game. Story line is cool and all characters have their own story. If u like hang out by yourself, im sure you will like this game. I spent my hours in my first days. Im addicted it"
12643,"This review is for the Steam version specifically, not Stardew Valley as a general game: I would give it 1 star if you only own a keyboard and mouse, and 3 of 5 stars if you own a controller, because this game was for sure ""ported"" from a mobile platform to the PC and is **indescribably** frustrating to play with a keyboard and mouse. If your character is facing one way, but you accidentally left your mouse pointed somewhere else (because walking is still WSAD, not mouse) then they take action toward the mouse, not the direction you're facing. This elevates from ""annoying"" to ""enraging"" when the game penalizes your ""stamina"" for every action as well as consumables like water or fishing bait

It's also one of those games where you just have to guess what's part of the scenery and what is something you can take action upon, and that's usually by walking over to it and seeing if some magic icon appears, or (of course) learning that you can't walk over to it because it _is_ scenery but you're not a big enough person to crawl over the mighty tall impassible fence or whatever. Related to that, it really jams me up when games say you can't walk over grass. Like, how tall is this grass that a character has to walk around it instead of over it?

This game is seems to be trying to be ""realistic"" in that the character has to sleep and eat constantly, which if you're into that, fine, but it's not _fun_ to be constantly managing that stuff. It's like if they turned the heart system in Minecraft up to 11 or whatever

Also, the fishing minigame can die in a fire

Look, I know it has gadzillions of ""we love it"" reviews, but this is my experience, and my advice: buy a controller for this game"
12644,"this game is a super fun and laid back experience, which i feel has drawn myself as well as a lot of other players to it. As someone that normally plays fighting games, FPS games, and MOBAs, coming to Stardew Valley after a long stressful session of ranked is just what some people need. :3"

I absolutely love this game, I originally played on Xbox and now with PC I have capabilities to mod, however, the game doesn't even need to be modded, it is just that amazing. I have barely dived into the content with my current playtime. The game does a great job at immersing the player within the world. I recommend this game 100%!"

There are so many things to discover, I still find things I haven't seen before. The great community and wiki can answer every wuestion you have."

12756,"I am a 49 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

12771,"Stardew Valley, my beloved, most cherished game. The superb craftsmanship of this smash hit indie game is one to invest in for ages to come. I simply become the town wench in every play-through. It is so hard to decide which man or woman to commit to... but for some reason I can't fathom a life without Shane, the town's raging alcoholic. I can fix him... I know I can. All it takes is 50 mods to do so... including the one where I can watch him stroke his meat stick lovingly in the back of the saloon. I especially find him endearing when he is laying in the middle of the field drunk out of his mind. It reminds me of when I went into anaphylaxis and almost died in a field. He is just like me fr. Enough about Shane though, for he is only one of many sexy little munchkins waiting to be romanced... only one of many hearts you can break. You think this is an ordinary farming sim... well you are wrong. You will experience love and loss, hate and betrayal, rivalry and victory, all in one 8-bit experience. This game is not for the faint of heart, but you will grow exponentially as a person through this life-altering coming of farm."
12772,"I can't recommend this game enough. There's so much depth and replay-ability to this game, the fact that it was created by one person always blows my mind."
12773,yes
12774,Christ in Heaven I've never experienced a bigger loss of time than I have with this game.
12775,"I downloaded this because it reminded me of the Terraria art-style I love, and also because so many people said it was calming to play. I AM SO NOT CALM. My energy runs out?? I have no idea how to get seeds without paying for them, but I can't get money unless I sell fish, but fish are so difficult to to catch!!!!! And then I have to EAT?!!?!? The map is HUGE and I can not keep up with all the tasks I have to do. Also IN.VEN.TOR.Y. It is TINY but to get the expanded bag I need money, and we all know how THAT goes. 
I know it sounds like I'm complaining, but I'm not. The game is lovely, and peaceful, and goes at a nice pace. These are just things that caught me off-guard based on comments I'd heard from those who recommended this to me. Stardew is a VERY enjoyable game, and I can feel an obsession on the way. Absolutely worth a download - just be prepared hahaha xx

(I love clearing the land it's def my favourite part)"
12776,its so addictive
12777,really fun
12778,"[h1] I liked it, I've played better games though. [/h1]
Great farming game, never played Harvest Moon all the way through but I heard if you ever played it, you would like this. Besides that, I do think the Villagers could be more dynamic but the coop isn't too dry if you're looking to play this with friends. (Separate devices btw) I've played 3 years on console and just a bit on PC and either way I personally prefer the PC version. The game with mods included such as cheats and such can get kind of boring but if you want a nice reinforcement version of the game I recommend Stardew Valley Expanded. I'll admit when I played that mod at the start it felt like a whole new world, or should I say valley? 

This review is getting too long, sorry. All in all, pretty decent game play time is around maybe 20-30 hours."
12779,"Kinda makes you relax, its pretty fun"
12780,"Love the gameplay, animation and character development"

12788,Very heartfelt game. Like traditional vibes. Liking it a lot so far. It’s so calming. Can’t wait to learn how to raise animals and grow crops:

12791,Love the art and pretty much everything about that game 10/10!
12792,pretty good
12793,Prepare to see your time and social life slip away.
12794,love this game
12795,A fuking beautiful game.
12796,My friends looked for love interests but the real way to play this game is to capitalize on grapes and wine to sell them off for massive amounts of profit $$$ (Don't give your money to your friends😋)
12797,Very good game
12798,Good game! A pleasure to lose yourself into.
12799,good game i have to say

12806,Got me laid IRL and in-game 10/10 definitely recommended
12807,I named my chicken chop
12808,"I named my farm Cannabis farm and set my favourite item to Cannabis. Glad to know Grandpa's pride and joy is Cannabis farm. Every time I get a stardrop, it says that my thoughts are filled with thoughts of Cannabis, or that it tastes like Cannabis. There was a dialogue where Lewis said that the local economy has been picking up because of Cannabis Farm. I recently did the quest where you give Gus eggs, and he said it wasn't from Marnie's farm, but Cannabis farm, and then Marnie said ""Mmmm... Cannabis eggs."" I can't escape the Cannabis. Any second somebody could mention it. I am at the mercy of my own Cannabis even though you can't actually grow Cannabis in this game.

Petition to make Cannabis a plant in this game.

420/420.69"
12809,yea
12810,nice game
12811,"I've wanted this game for years, and got it 3 days ago and i've already got 46 hours on it! Great and addicting game, with great story and indepth farming and grinding systems that rewards you for collecting everything. Gotta give it a try!"
12812,"duh its stardew valley its the modern harvest moon with endless replayability, and with constant content mods by fans

12817,"i like everything about this game, the fact that you can build relationship with the npcs and there are lots of quests to do so you will never be bored."
12818,Sex dlc when?
12819,"Stardew Valley is one of the most relaxing games to play. To farming, to fishing, to combat. Everything in this game is an enjoyment and the wholesome vibe that Stardew Valley exudes is a delight. The NPCs are all worth knowing and you really feel a part of the entire small town which is really nice and adds to that wholesome vibe. I definitely recommend this game to anyone."
12820,gud
12821,bit lost
12822,wholesome af :)
12823,"Super fun game to play alone or together with a super passionate developer.
If it looks fun to you, get it!"
12824,nicw relaxing game
12825,"this game brings me such internal happiness. i don't know if its because its so nice to farm and live a life where i can sell fish everyday. there's something so welcoming about this game, it doesn't matter if i've had the worst day or the best i can always come to this game and give shane a beer. because he'll always be there to offer me a cold one and share the same burden of working a crap job. this game is wonderful, you will love this game and it will love you back. (also everyone wants you, you're that guy ;)"

It's very full, I've been playing for several years and, well especially with the most recent update, there's just always stuff to do. The music is great, the mini games are fun, the characters are cool and well written, it's just. Two chefs kisses."
12833,"First played this on my Switch and fell in love with it after watching a youtuber play it, and watching him play a modded version made me curious. I got the computer version while it was on sale and I'm having a blast with all the modded versions I can do. Definitely recommend this game, and recommend modding it too for even more fun."

The community is so friendly and helpful, it's a real joy to be apart of this wonderful experience we've been given. There are constantly new updates being released too. I honestly couldn't be any happier with a purchase. 10/10"

12858,"This game is so good. It's the perfect game to relax when you don't know what to do. I love the music, the gameplay loop, the art style and I especially love FISHING."
12859,"I honestly don't get the hype around this game.

I've obviously put an insane amount of hours into the game already and I'm still actively playing. The graphics are what made me hesitant in the first place but I've been kicking myself for not getting this game sooner.

Thank you ConcernedApe! We can tell you really care about the game and the community"
12877,"This game has embedded itself into my brain and I am perfectly okay with that. Love it dearly. Great music, love the art, very fun to play with friends or just on your own."

12888,It is Fun
12889,"There is so much to do, but it can all be ignored. The game spells itself out in the intro. You are free to play the game as you wish: be a normal farmer, a miner, a fisher, or some combination. There is no mandatory missions to progress. It might be slower, but even enough plant fiber can afford seeds, ore, and other items."
12890,stradew balley
12891,Love the game < 3
12892,hella good
12893,":) genuine peaceful game, i enjoy"
12894,"This game is a masterpiece. To think just one guy was able to pull something this amazing and complete just baffles me. This game is much more than a farming simulator, it feels alive and so do its characters. The lore is very deep and the variety of content it offers is extremely wide. It does not matter if you are a very dedicated gamer or just casual, there is content for everyone on this game."
12895,good game
12896,"it's honestly super fun and relaxing. if you like animal crossing, you'll 100% adore this game! they give off the same vibe. haven't been able to stop playing since i got it and i'm supposed to be studying! oops..... :)))
"
12897,I love stardew valley. It's so relaxing and simple and it's something that grounds me when I need time to calm from a hectic day. Thank you for creating an amazing game!

12926,"As someone who used to work for a toxic corporation (from 2017-2021), I would often seek solace in the world of Stardew Valley. After all, what better escape from our capitalist hellscape than a video game about quitting your soul-sucking corporate job and becoming a farmer? While it's no substitute for therapy, Stardew sure as hell comes close."
12927,"This game has taken over my life. I have played nearly 40 hours in a week, its all i can think about. The worse part is is that I'm not even that good at the game, I'm running around like a headless chicken half of the time."
12928,"this is my favorite game, I only play this game"
12929,"It's a fun and very addicting little farming sim, with a lot of things for you to do. It still amazes me that this whole thing was made by just one person."
12930,great and relaxing
12931,Its amazing.
12932,"this game is such an experience, it is too bootyful to even put into words. I am so enamored that I would recommend this to my grandchildren once I am no longer living. I love this game."
12933,I lo
12934,"Honestly, a really fun game. I don't play that many video games anymore, but I do not regret buying Stardew Valley at all. There is so much to do, all plenty of fun. I love just wandering around and like relaxing. You never are pushed to complete the goals or anything before you are ready, the game can go as fast or as slow as you'd like. I appreciate the characters too, pretty fun dialogue. So many choices and ways to play. If you have friends that are into Stardew, you can even play with them. Overall, lovely game, no matter who you are, I think you'll be able to find enjoyment in this game. Highly recommend :)"
12935,Good
12936,"Very fun game, with a lot of replay value. I have played over 100 hours on my switch and just got Stardew Valley on my laptop. Great game."

12939,"Fantastic game! Harvestmoon-influenced game, but 1000x better.  I Cannot praise the Developer, Concerned Ape, enough.  He puts most AAA title games to shame.  I will anything this developer touches."
12940,"Yes, tis good
"
12941,"poggers,mods are insane"

12956,We love daddy Elliott.
12957,This game is really fun! I love the characters and the whole vibe in general!
12958,I played this game for 9 hours straight what the hell is wrong with me
12959,"Me and my sister got this game and preceded to play for just about 6 hours straight. If your looking for a chill game you can play with friends then stardew valley is perfect whether you. Want to farm, fish, or mine in the caves while your buddy's fight of monsters? There's always something for you to do and I think it's definitely worth the price especially if you get it on sale."
12960,Amazing
12961,"As a completionist, there are very few games who can not only be fun for both the casual player and the skilled player and have a lot of content, but ALSO stay fun throughout the experience all the way to completion. And even when you complete it you can go back and do challenge runs and things like that."

12971,This is hands down the single greatest game I have ever played! I come from a main background of FPS games and games alike and no game has ever gave me so much enjoyment!
12972,This game is very nice. also you can put hats on your horse :)

12976,Game Good.
12977,"I think this is a really good game for anyone, not just girls (I feel like games like these are marketed towards the stereotypical teenage girl). The story, alongside the creative freedom of the player, makes for an extremely interesting game. I haven't been playing for that long but I have honestly really enjoyed what I've been able to do, and have been exposed to, since I started playing. I wholly recommend getting this game."
12978,"Loved the game, I think its got a wide range of things to do so you're never bored even if you've ""finished"" the game, only problem is that its hard (at least for me) to mod but I think the vanilla game its pretty good anyway so its not the end of the world."
12979,i have a combined playtime of over 470 hours across all platforms. please send help im starting to still play stardew in my dreams

13013,It's a very cute game that is sure to bring a smile to your face if you just want to chill and relax and find a nice escape.
13014,"Having just recently bought and played the game, it is definitely worth it! Love the little story progression as well as the freedom!"

13032,"Great game since covid came out, isolate at your farm and sell things through a chest where the mayor himself will come out nightly and check the chest and pay you for what you left in it. Just like real life!"

13042,I got Stardew Valley about a year ago and it is one of the best games I ever got. I wouldn't take back all the time I spent on the game. The game is very re-playable and fun to experience. Very relaxing and has just enough action in the mines to be fun for any player. Stardew Valley will make you come back time and time again. Would 100% recommend getting it.
13043,Great game for sitting back and relaxing!
13044,"eu tinha mó preconceito com esse jogo por já ter jogado harvest moon, mas quando comecei a jogar, ME VICIEI MUITO!

I've actually bought the game on multiple devices as well and logged over 200 hours (just not on PC). Can't wait to try a co-op game! Highly recommend! :)"

13081,"What an amazing game. I didn't thought this game were so fun to play. If someone is looking for a game to play and get endless of hours in it.
 Than buy Stardew Valley. 

The gameplay might be simple but fun and some time repetetive. The dialouges in the game are some times simple but effective to the player like ""I really like this"" when you give someone a gift they like. A bonus with the game it has pixelart graphics that looks astonishing good.

Stardew Valley do offer some great soundtracks in the game that you can listen hours of and never get tired of. 
It's a well made game when it made by one person. 

If you want more of this game you can get mods like Stardew Valley expanded, 

After all Stardew Valley is worth buying you ain't regretting  it"

13099,One of my alltime favorite games. Highly recommend if you just want to relax and have fun.
13100,"This is one of my go-to comfort games. It's a chill farming game with interesting characters to meet (and possibly romance) and there's also some rpg aspects with the mines. I love that it is multiplayer! I have a lot of great memories playing this with my friends late into the night. Also, even after playing everything the game has to offer (which is surprisingly a lot), you can continue playing using the countless community mods! 

One of the best farming games out there. 10/10 for sure!"

13123,"Stardew Valley is an amazing game. I've played more hours than what steam shows because I play on multiple platforms. In total, I've probably played around 750 hours and there's always more to the game. I love the little town and I enjoy how it makes you want to help others. Shane is my favorite and I always have to get my blue chickens. Money well spent."

13129,"AITA for telling a pregnant coworker to stop about her pregnancy to me?

I (28M) have a coworker (30?F) who recently found out she was pregnant and she has been talking about it non-stop. I get that it’s exciting for her and even though I couldn’t really care less I’m not one to strike down small talk just because it’s not relevant to me personally. My issue really is with the amount of talk. At first it was fine, but for the past 2 months that she has known she has talked to me at length (minimum 20 minutes) about her pregnancy every single day. I feel like I know the ins and outs of her pregnancy better than her gyno at this point.

The other day I told her that I wasn’t really all that interested in the particularities of her pregnancy and that she was talking about it a lot and to maybe strike up conversation with someone else. She then told me that she only talks to me about it because she’s one of the only women in the department and no one but the 2 other woman and me, ‘the gay guy’, would wanna hear about it. Honestly that pissed me off a lot and I responded harsher than I think was maybe appropriate.

I told her that I didn’t care about the inner workings of her uterus and that she should keep it to herself. I’m not her OBGYN and it’s obnoxious. I also told her that we aren’t friends, and that coworkers, gay or straight, don’t wanna get regular updates on how the pregnancy sex she’s having with her husband is so much better, or how she craves drinking peanut oil, or how her boobs have gotten bigger.

She was pretty upset after I chewed her out and has been avoiding me ever since, she’s barely willing to talk to me even if it’s work relevant. I overheard her complaining about how vicious I was to her and that I made her feel ashamed for being pregnant/having a pregnant body. That wasn’t my intention, but I do now worry that I crossed a line and that I was the asshole."
13130,bought this because i watched some irish maniac play it while roleplaying as walter white

13134,"Lovely, wholesome game that I became quickly engaged with (slightly addicted MAYBE) and enjoy playing solo or with friends! It does a great job of slowly adding new events or challenges to keep things interesting but still remaining built on the basics and being a great game to just play to unwind and relax."

13151,I like the game it is cool especially when I get to farm the plants! :) The plants make me lots of money. I love plants they are so cool. Starfruit is very profitable so I like to farm that and make lots of alcoholic beverages in my sheds then sell the alcoholic beverages for money. Farming the plants is so fun 10/10 would recommend. You should definitely buy this game so you can farm the plants.

13183,Super cute and charming game. Gives you a new appreciation for the environment and community. Definitely recommend if you're looking for something fun and relaxing! :)
13184,fun to play with friends and alone. love that you can love almost anybody
13185,Stardew Valley is a delightful farming/adventure game that can be as relaxing or involved as you want it to be. Just a downright fantastic game.
13186,good
13187,"I thought the game was just farming, but it really is about the entire town that your character becomes a part of!  The game can be peaceful or exciting.  I also love a game with fishing mechanics!"
13188,amazing.
13189,gets REALLY addicting once you get the hang of the basics.
13190,"I love this game! I have bought it on multiple platforms and for numerous friends and put in almost a thousand hours between platforms. If you're into farming simulators like harvest moon, or animal crossing, give this a shot if you haven't already!"

13203,"tltr: I like the game. It has a lot of repetitive actions, but is relaxing. I would recommend. If you're not sure, just buy on sale. Many hours worth of gameplay.

I personally wasn't sure if I would like this game or not; as repetitive actions in a game are either hit or miss with me (dopamine craving yk). But I bit the bullet and ended up loving this game. I often play it when I just want to use up time because I find myself playing for hours at a time. The characters in the game are cute and often lovable. I like how you learn more about them slowly and experience moments with them. The farming, mining, etc, are also easy to understand and do. The game is just very relaxing (personally) to play."
13204,farm.
13205,Great game if you got a couple close friends!
13206,"I really love this game and I can't think of any downsides.

Every game I get I always google ""games like stardew valley"" and none compare! The characters, the lore, the experience. Its just great."

13213,Good Game
13214,I like it
13215,mk oyununu bir kere adam gibi bitiremedim
13216,"This game is a little but older but still a treasure. Game-play is good, tho a little hard to follow or figure out what to do. Would recommend to someone with a little time to spare. Not for those who want extensive interactive game play. Similar to Minecraft in some regards yet uniquely distinct."
13217,farmer grindset
13218,So you wanna be a farmer huh?
13219,"Great and well-designed game if you like Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing, but if you're on the fence because you don't typically like these kinds of games, it's not so good that it's going to convert you."
13220,awesome price of a game with the amount of replayability (is that a word... or the wrong word ? oh well to lazy to look it up)... i will say that it does take a while to understand the game at first and the beginning can be a little boring but once you get the hang of it... its really fun and a wonderful gaming experience. theres so much to do and with each time you create a new save in the game it will be different from the last which is an awesome element. yes yes
13221,"This game,,,is so much fun and I cannot explain it. I prefer multi-player and have a farm with over a hundred hours with my best friend.
There is SO much to do in this game. Want to get married? Go for it ! Want to barely interact aside from one or two npcs or maybe just with your friend on the multi-player? Yep Go Ahead ! The only thing I don't like is the fishing mechanic and I think that's just cause I've never been able to grasp it, on Switch, Phone or PC so I just don't do it because I don't like getting frustrated with such a generally calming game.
That's another thing about this game I love though, it's calming and relaxing to play. There is no rush, there is no high stakes really. It's my favourite game along with Powerwash Simulator to play when I'm not doing great mentally. I adore this game and highly recommend it if you want to play something casual and calming"
13222,One of the greatest games of the decade. Very thoughtful and immersive. I recommend it to everyone.
13223,Fun to play when you're bored and just wanna vibe and listen to music.
13224,"I love this game so much, it's a super chill game that is great for relaxing or killing time."
13225,.
13226,Amazing game! I shall charge the creator for my therapy fees because when I first went through Shane's romance i was depressed. I then went on to marry him again.
13227,chill
13228,goos
13229,super relaxing and cozy but needs couple of tutorials to new players
13230,"[spoiler] Stardew Valley Fair Event: The prize wheel is a 75% win chance for green and 25% win chance for orange even though it does look like 50/50. That alone is a 1/10 for the game. Just no. 
On top of that it seems that there is a thing going on where the chances switch sometimes because its just not legit that you can lose 4-5 times in a row while betting on green (75%) and that a total of 6 times. Every time playing minigames to get some points again just to lose them exactly like I mentioned before (at this point I wouldnt be surprised if these devs actually implemented something as ridiculous as that) ... nice fun game

Also after finally collecting those stu**d points after about 30min you get a random dc and cant join the Event after rejoining (so.. everything lost. wow.)

So as nice as this game in itself can be I am baffled that with all the things going on in stardew valley and all the thought put behind it the developers still managed to fu** up so many of the most basic things that you would expect a game like this one to have. So many Qol opportunities missed or straight up ignored. [/spoiler]"
13231,"You can probably tell from my ever increasing number of hours that this game holds a special place in my heart. Not only is this game a massive inspiration to me personally as an aspiring game developer, but it's also just a fun game in every way. There's always something to work towards, and it's always fun! The NPCs are charming and unique and the gameplay just has so much to offer. Even after over 400 hours, I still find new little tricks and tips that light up that lightbulb above my head and make me go ""how did I not think of that? That's awesome!"" If I had to pick ONE game in the WHOLE WIDE WORLD to get everyone to try out, there isn't a singular doubt in my mind Stardew Valley would win, every time."
13232,"fun with friends

After 167 hours, this game still feels fresh and is a go to whenever I have some spare time. There is a great online wiki to help you progress and answer any questions you have. Plenty of mods to spice up the base game as well."

13252,"Each time I start up a new farm in Stardew Valley or return to my 100-hour save on PC, I feel like I’m going home. There’s a comfort in Stardew Valley that I’ve rarely found in other games. The music that changes with each season perfectly fits the mellowness of the 16-bit countryside town, and all the activities that await offer both peace in my daily routines and excitement in the land’s mysteries. Whether you want to farm, fish, fight monsters, craft, mine, become everyone’s best friend, or do a little bit of everything, this farming adventure has plenty to offer. "" Miranda Sanchez""

13274,"I absolutely love this game. When I got it on the Switch all I did was play it on the go. This is a fun little Harvest Moon clone, but in a good way! Very relaxing. You don't have to just farm all day. If you want to hack and slash enemies, you can go down into the mines. Overall I love this game. I've purchased it on every console and steam and I can't recommend it more."
13275,super fun game!! esp if ur a hottie like me :)
13276,"it pretty good game, grow the plants, make th e moneies"
13277,Ngl this game has saved my mental health quite a few times. It's a peaceful game about farming that I initially thought was a horror game in disguise because I was so tense when I first played. Now I just find it relaxing.
13278,fun
13279,"Fun and cute, easy and also good to play co-op... brilliant single player too"

13286,"[b]General review[/b]
Stardew valley was initially made by a single developer and the first version was released on February 26, 2016 on PC. Later the game would come out on other platforms and even on mobile. In this game you create your own farm, meet with all the various characters of the world and take part of the community in whatever way you'd like. Aside from farming there are other 'Skills' to learn such as fishing and mining. This game is an amazing piece of art and should be part of everyone's library at some point. Let's grade some of the core aspects of the game;

[b]Technical aspects[/b]

13287,Farm make brain happy
13288,haha nice.
13289,"Words cannot describe how much I love this game. I've played for years and will probably continue to. The lore, hidden secrets and personalities of all the characters make me feel like I disappear into their world. So good, and I'm super obsessed with it."
13290,this game will give you the chillz
13291,ممتعة ولكن تبلع الوقت، انصح تنلعب كووب لاختصار هدر الوقت فيها و ممكن تكون ممتعة اكثر
13292,"That feeling when everything is going right is amazing, you got your farm working fine, making friends with the villagers, progressing smoothly. Love it"
13293,I hate sun
13294,it is not mc?
13295,:)
13296,"yes, do it."
13297,I have this game on all my things from switch  to ps4 lol
13298,"very great game if you like farming and hard work and the grind 
"
13299,very fun game
13300,Literally one of the sweetest games ive ever played. Great to waste a lot of time.
13301,good
13302,cool
13303,Nice Relaxing Game i ever played
13304,My friends on discord were extremely concerned when I played for 10 hours straight.
13305,i didn't get this game long ago and already have over 70 hours. so i would say its pretty good.
13306,i dont like it
13307,"I dont play this much because i have over 500 games on steam, but when i do it instantly relaxes me, It is fun to play solo or with a friend and its just peaceful. In a era where e-sports become more popular and fast paced games are dominating the market, there is something really refreshing about playing a game where the moment to moment game-play is farming, fishing, mining, exploring, chatting, and house building. Its got a ton of variety and every single thing, even the combat is slow paced and relaxing. This is one of the easiest recommends i could give to someone who wants a nice wholesome game to play."
13308,there are no  good hoes in the game
13309,It cool
13310,Married Haley after the first winter and my love for her is undeniably too much.
13311,"super fun, and very relaxing too. the characters are cute and theres lots of stuff to do"
13312,it good :) me likey
13313,"efaefaefadfaWf aef seta st abrhndty dtculn sryjyu k,m.jykhu 68fluod4wr A"
13314,"SPOILERS

fun game. really good time waster and the fast-paced curve of starting out with two dollars and then farming your way to ten million is great. one gripe; SO MUCH of this fucking game feels like homework. I don't want to have to wait until its raining during fall while my asshole is exactly 3.14 inches prolapsed and completely clean just so i can catch the fucking magical carp whos scales make you instantly orgasm when you eat them. This can be subverted in the early-game by being a sellout and just buying the upgrades that usually require a year or twos length of time (if you haven't googled a fucking spreadsheet the size of mars so you know exactly where everything is and when to get it). you cant buy your way to victory in the end game, though. the endgame where you go to a cool island that has 130 of a unique currency (some which are hidden in completely unique spots, others based on luck during minigames). you need to unlock more of the currency to progress the island, and you have to find 100 out of 130 to unlock a super secret room filled with MORE HOMEWORK. achieve ""perfection"" by sucking off all the villagers and selling every type of crop fifteen times during winter or some SHIT just so you can buy the golden chicken egg and actually start using coops to make MONEY. 

if you like grindy bullshit then get ready to learn EVERY nuance of the game and how to work with it. otherwise youll just have to live happily ever after with your sub-optimal end game farm."
13315,Very fun game
13316,this game is very fun alone or with friends :D
13317,So fun and so much to do!
13318,Yes <3
13319,"One of the best games, so addictive:)"
13320,The thing I love about this game is that it is pretty addiciting and also that my boyfriend never really felt like playing it because he thought it wouldnt be that fun to do for a longer time. Now we are at year 2 almost after 3 days. :D
13321,SO CUTE & FUN
13322,THE STOLE MY CHILD but it's alright I have a dino now

13326,"Me play long went potty in pants

13327,Ah yeah watering 150 plants = fun. Shops open at 9 o'clock. why. Blacksmith takes your stuff away when you want to upgrade them for a few days. why. All the spriklers except the last one are dogS'H'I'T. why. No tractor. why.
13328,Love it so much.
13329,"One of the best casual games out there! Spent almost 50 hours with my friends playing this game.
A must buy game <3"
13330,"To much Stardew, not enough Valley."
13331,"Stardew Valley is.. Nice.

Jokes about my playtime aside it's a genuinely amazing game and a great one to play on a day you just need to unwind and relax."

13353,chimkin
13354,MEGA PIZDATO
13355,fun game for relaxing
13356,"Stardew valley is a great game to just chill and grow crops, fish or explore the mines. There are hundreds of quests you can do given by the npcs of pelican town. Personally, i really enjoy it"
13357,nice chill game
13358,Good game with alot to unfold meaning there is always something to do or work for
13359,"Day 1025 of not getting outside, it’s getting weird… WHY I CANT MARRY ALL OF THEM !?!?!!

pretty addictive and you can get yourself a free goth bf :3"
13360,"Cute game, relaxing, it's nice to come here with friends and just vibe and mess around. Good game to play and pass time by."
13361,Perfect game to just relax and zone out to 10/10
13362,Good game
13363,SO FUN!!!
13364,"Friend has all my hard work on his farm...

13365,Game
13366,its very addicting
13367,blue chicken
13368,what the hell is going on
13369,farming has never been this fun
13370,"this is a ""farming sim"" where you really don't have to do that much farming if you don't want to. I spent most of my time in the mines. 10/10"
13371,"This game is a very relaxing game, and is very nice on any day, anytime. The fact that this game has multiplayer is amazing because you can play with your friends, and you can marry people like a friend that is playing with you or one of the villagers. (*My pick for marrying someone is probs Sebastian lol*). Anyway this game is very mild in difficulty but it's very fun I will say. And, when the train passes by, that noise (plus the free ores) is the best thing everr! I hope you like my review and thank you for reading all of this maybe beautiful mess of words put together to hopefully complete my school essay I have due at 6:00 am, and it is 1:00 am lolll. <3 <3 >:)"
13372,.
13373,So freaking addictive! Where does the time go? lol
13374,"Relaxing, mindless fun."

13379,"It's like you're really there, passing out every 5 seconds every day!"
13380,I love this game. But I've yet to make it to year 2. I would love to see a Stardew Valley 2. But I still have lots of play through this. Just wish it would support workshop mods. In time for the Steam Deck. I want a modded handheld stardew! :)
13381,"Nice
"
13382,"very fun, but time consuming. This game is very chill and it is very well produced

13394,"farm, forage, fish, fight, mine. amazing game"
13395,"It has quite the Animal Crossing feel to it, except the days progress faster than that of the former. Animal Crossing is an adorable simulation game, however, Stardew Valley seems more immersive to me. I could play Stardew Valley for hours and not tire of it. It is even more fun with friends. Having that perfect pair or trio will help to progress the game even more. With my two friends, we have gotten very far in the game and it is so much fun. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone who likes this genre of game. Or even, those who don't like it. You never know, it could surprise you"
13396,Reminds me of Harvest Moon! sends me straight back to my childhood!
13397,fun with friends
13398,Plss play dis it great. And if u great like me you can make urself have infinite ♾️ money uwu
13399,"Put a few hours into it. Like it a lot.

Then I played co-op.

I gifted my partner hardwood. Love it a lot."
13400,yes
13401,good
13402,LOVE Stardew and finally got it on my laptop to experiment with Mods...I feel like a kid again! Now I need a real gaming laptop!
13403,"My absolute favorite game of the last decade. I regret not buying it sooner. So far I've made 3 different farms, and a few with friends, and each time is an absolute delight. If you like the rush of checking things off a list, and getting things done, this is the game for you. It's just peaceful enough that I can relax while playing, but with enough excitement to keep my entertained for hours. It's also easy to sit down and play just 1 day cycle (around 15-20 minutes of real-time time) if you don't have a big window for gaming, and it's a great game to sit down and play a whole season in 1 session (can be a few hours). I will be playing this game for years and excited about it every time I start it up."
13404,"This game is so fun, but I really wish there was an option to lessen the time constraint. So frustrating to forget what time it is and then it's too late to make it back home."
13405,epic
13406,Very nice game I like it a lot
13407,Me when my 30h of playing are basicaly just fishing and killing things in the cave
13408,great game
13409,Amazing game especially when you need to de-stress and escape from the real world
13410,"very slay

13411,A very deep game that's super relaxing!!!
13412,"There isn't a device i don't have this game on. 

Get it."
13413,i FRICKING love this game it has helped me relax and actually enjoy playing games
13414,nice game
13415,it good
13416,"So far, very new, enjoying what the game has to offer. Having a lot of fun exploring blindly. Do recommend. I'm the type of player to play really really hard games and get frustrated a lot by said games and I thought of getting something less stressful but that my brain could still be teased and tested to relax after such frustrations."
13417,farm
13418,"really makes you feel like a vinland saga arc

10/10 fr fr"
13419,"super cute and fun

13420,"The best game ever, farm, mobs, romance, events, all, amazing!!"
13421,Cool Game
13422,yes
13423,its gud big pog
13424,its ok.
13425,This game is so fun & it has so many mysteries & quests & mini games & It's so wild & free & so much adventure & exploring & Relationships & making your own charictor & starting from nothing to me getting to the 3rd year & I LOVE IT!! I think it's my favourite game on steam! You must try it!
13426,What I thought was just a random chill farming simulator (which i would have been happy with) has turned out to be a wonderfully deep and complex adventure. I've sunk in many hours already and I am fully ready to sink in hundreds more :)
13427,"very cute and silly, makes me feel productive and cool"
13428,starjew valle
13429,"Absolutely love this game and constantly recommend it to anyone who will listen (and who enjoys similar farming/life simulators). It's one of those games where you will play it non-stop for awhile and then let it go, only to return to it months (or even a year later) and pick it right up again. The multiplayer is enjoyable too if you have someone to play with, and it's nice to see it is still getting updated now and again. It gives me the nostalgic vibes of Harvest Moon, but different enough that it is a classic in it's own right. If you enjoy Harvest Moon, Rune Factory, or Story of Season series and haven't tried Stardew Valley yet, do it!"
13430,yes
13431,joined a friend's game. there was a cat on my bed. i right clicked the cat. a heart appeared over cat's head. 10/10 game.
13432,its great and has a lot of replay options!
13433,it good:)
13434,cuite
13435,farm go brrrrrrr
13436,"great game, fantastic, but i personally find it ridiculous how badly this game punishes you for dying in the mines. like fuck off. i'd rather instant alt + f4 and redo the day."
13437,"If you like farming games and don't mind things getting a bit repatative, and like to find ways to break profit margins, then you'll enjoy the game. It's got fun interactions with the villagers as well, and Concerned Ape does a good job and keeping the games longevity going."
13438,Its a Really good game I 100% Recommend this game.
13439,10/10 I marry Elliott every time
13440,"its soo much fun but.. i didn't know how dark it really could get. I have always wanted too play stardew and it has been a dream come true!!!

13443,"very cool and very good aslo guess what it is very good

13444,fun with friends
13445,i like when the farm does the thing
13446,"Great game! They've recently added a lot to it, especially late game and I'm very excited to explore it. the game is fun from the beginning and gets even better the more you play and learn about the townspeople. :)"
13447,"One, if not one of the best games ive ever played.

Adding the SVE mod and playing with friends makes it even better.

10/10"
13448,This game is great. Pelted Lewis and Morris with eggs and reset the day so they never recalled and I got to sell the eggs instead. 7 stardrops/5
13449,yep
13450,"This game is amazing. I've played so much of it, the mods make it a great experience, with full reskins and feature addings, great QOL and so on, but the main game shouldn't be underestimated either! It has a lot of content to explore, and i've not managed to finish it yet, even with 280 hours.

Also the multiplayer is amazing."
13451,yes
13452,"Probably one of my favorite games, it is truly amazing. Easy enough to learn, lots of things to do.
A great game to play solo or multiplayer with your friends! :)"
13453,very fun
13454,"This game is going to take your brain, twist it up, soak it in potato juice, and spit it back out. Amazing game, 10/10. Would've preferred a warning about the emotional toll and mindfuck but I love it nonetheless."
13455,i have this on switch for a vanilla run and on my mac for a modded run. it is so much fun and has so many objectives. i absolutely adore it!
13456,very very good and gay!
13457,Really fun and mostly relaxing game. I especially love the Alex's and Sebastian's heart cutscenes.
13458,Brilliant
13459,mmmm
13460,Very gud game. I farm. I go mine. I go fish. Yes

13487, Great
13488,SO GOOD I LOVE IT SM
13489,"THE farming simulator, period"
13490,I LOVE EVERYTHING
13491,Very fun and mind numbing but in the best way
13492,its pretty good
13493,"Growing up playing Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley is exactly what I always wanted!"
13494,"10000000000/10 Get it bought and play it!

It took me so long to play this game, so many people recommended it and I kept putting it off and off. Mostly because of graphics among other things. I played all Harvest Moon/SOS games and those type of games in recent years were getting really stale with the same tired formula. But eventually I got Stardew Valley on Switch so I could play it on the go like a DS- and my god- I wish I'd of picked it up back then!

I've sunk hours and hours into this game but one of the best pluses is that I connected with my friends/family playing it co-op. I love the gameplay, it's suited to any playstyle- you wanna just play a dating sim, it's that, farm sim? Go raise some livestock or grow crops and trees. Just like designing stuff? You've got numerous Farm layouts to choose from and go ham. Maybe you like combat- or just plodding about adventuring. There's always something new in this game and was addicted well and truly. And I am in the minority that absolutely love the fishing game!

Then, I bought it on steam and was introduced the modded community and fell in love with the game again. It opens up the game completely and there are so many mods that turn the game into something completely new. Or if you're like me and loved the core game, just adding stuff into it that's just for aesthetics or adds new places/people. Similar to how you would add DLC to a game. My favourites and 100% must haves are ""Stardew Valley Expanded"" ""Ridgeside Village"" Hell there's even magic now so you can be your own wizard!!  

What I will say is that SMAPI- the modding device is pretty complicated to put in, but the mods themselves are really simple once you get past initial setup! 

I do appreciate that I played it vanilla first and I would recommend anyone do that FIRST because like a good book/movie you can't experience twice, this you actually can and it's worth it.
"
13495,"Bought this game in 2017, it says I only have ~50 hours but I know I lost about 3 days in the first week of owning it.

Super tranquil, easy to sink time into."
13496,farm
13497,"this game is the best game I've ever played, Stardew valley is so relaxing and it has so much in it to do. I truley love this game and if you like faring simulators you might too!"
13498,"Relaxing, kinda of addictive ngl"
13499,"This game I would totally reccomend it is nice, relaxing, and is very productive! you will never run out of things to do in this game there is either mail coming in our just doing the requests you start out with. it is also a great game to play when you are bored of doing the same things over and over in other games. its price somewhat fits the games quality. Another good thing about the game is personality with npcs, every npc in the game likes different things and dresses and you may be saying well no duh dude all npcs have to be different but one npc may like sports while the other likes fashion this gives some variety between the npcs. but one bad but really small thing in the game is the npcs photos when you talk to them is whenever you do talk to them they all have the same face and maybe even the same expressions on the face and im specificely talking about the adult women npcs but that is not big problem and either way i still enjoy the game i would give this game a 9.6/10"
13500,women be shopping
13501,its pretty good
13502,I hate the season system
13503,E
13504,it has a fishing minigame
13505,So much fun - definitely recommend as an escape from stressful everyday life :D
13506,"this game has kept me busy for months on end and I am still barely even half way through one of my saves, and I have already made a second character so I can unlock things that I cant on my first save. I will forever recommend this game to people who are looking for something to distract themselves so they can relax"
13507,good
13508,It's good.
13509,"After playing this game, my grandfather decided to entrust me his farm.
Thanks Stardew Valley, now i get to play this game irl, 
I just hope that when i pass out i get teleported back to the house, otherwise im screwed."
13510,"a
"
13511,must not sleep. must keep farming.
13512,Very fun and chill would buy for myself and my kids
13513,"Stardew Valley has become my favorite game ever. It is such an exciting and relaxing experience. This is more than just a typical farming game. You can fish, forage items, go mining and fight monsters. By doing certain quests, for example the community center, you unlock more places in the valley for you to travel to. You unlock better methods to complete your work. There are festivals held by the town which are always a joy to attend to even though they're the same every year. In my opinion, the most underrated part of this whole game, is building friendships! By building friendships with the villagers, you learn more about them, and you dig deeper into their personal life, which I find super neat. You can even make some of the villagers better people! Like Haley and Alex. Even the little things in this game I find so cool. Let me talk about the farming now. You can grow crops (duh), you can buy coops and barns, then buy your very own farm animals! You even get your own house pet! You can get married and have children as well. There is so much more to this game believe it or not, but I won't explain any more because the rest are spoilers if you have not played this game. I 100% recommend this game :)"
13514,love it very addicting
13515,morris
13516,Love it!
13517,seems fun idk
13518,addicting but in a good way. super enjoyable game

13522,Muy buen jugo
13523,gud
13524,Good
13525,Really fun and good to play with online friends
13526,"I absolutely adore this game, it is very well made and so fun! Always things to do and money to make. The lore is amazing and its fun chatting to the villagers."
13527,"Brilliant game.  I love that the entire game was produced by one person.  Truly a work of art.

You can get into the story, the progression, the optimization of your farm, the mini-games.  This game scratches so many itches.  I  even heard of someone who feels the game improved their mental health by providing a new framework for thinking about their daily tasks in real life.

Just give this game a try.  It's a classic.

"
13528,The simple yet engaging gameplay great for a peacefull and fun time with a friend
13529,HOORAY I CAN FINALLY GET A GF
13530,it is a good game if you have time

Pigs goes oink oink 
Cows goes mooooooooo
Abigail goes “The wedding was wonderful... wasn’t it, dear? Well, we can’t forget about the farm... time to get to work!”"
13545,I've had this game for the switch the day after it was released on there and have put so many hours into it. I have to admit tho that this version is soooo much better! I love that you can play the vanilla way or add mods to spice things up! 10/10
13546,its so good and fun
13547,cant stop playing! highly recommend
13548,"stan robin

13564,fuck pierre. All my homies hate pierre
13565,"Really fun and chill there is surprisingly a lot to do, it's not just a farming game"
13566,"Just realised I haven't given this the big blue thumbs up yet, so here we go.

This game is still one of the best examples of the greatness that are indie games.
Its cute pixelart style and animations, which are somehow able to convey pretty detailed emotions and humour, are paired with a relatively easy game premise. The core game mechanics are varied enough to allow the player to keep working on their farm without getting bored.
It is also quite impressive how much the game has evolved over the years, allowing players to discover new areas or secrets quite some playtime into a save. And boy are there quite a few fun secrets / ""mini side missions"".

Just buy it already."
13567,"Rimworld, but without the guns and malaria."
13568,altered my brain chemistry permanently
13569,Addictive
13570,"Awesome game, countless hours of very chill gameplay. You have variety of option how to play the game, you can farm crops or explore the caves or raise animals. Also, it was made from 0 by just one very pasionate person. You won't regret buying this piece of art."
13571,"Love the game. Great to add to the collection of like minded games in my library such as Starbound, Sun Haven and many more. Fun for all ages who want a simple game to play."
13572,best simple game ever. Love to just sit down and relax playing this game
13573,"So, i like it."
13574,gut
13575,"Great game, love everything about it"
13576,"I love this game, but i don´t like when im about to sleep to save my day, i get kicked out of the game and it doesn´t save. So i have to do the days over and over again, at least two times."
13577,nice music
13578,"A very colourful chilled out game!
Yet still slightly challenging if you're one for keeping to quest deadlines and such.
Serves quite a few different styles as we have collections, farming, crafting, fishing, mining & the occasional slaying!
Definitely worth a go. I love it! 
"
13579,👍🦵
13580,super chill and fun to play. definitely recommend.

13598,"I've logged a couple hours so I might as well make my review.

This game was one of the first games I've ever bought and I don't regret it. This game was the product of one man's passion project. That man is ConcernedApe, one of the best developers that I know about.

It's like harvest moon, but better in pretty much everything it does. I loved making my farm look good while still keeping it productive. During early game winter, I usually spend my time fishing, mining, befriending townsfolk, and the likes. Once I unlocked a certain end-game area, I spent my time transforming it into my home away from home.

Pros:
🞄Fun life simulator with lots of neat easter eggs and care
🞄Beautiful Pixel Art 
🞄Well written imperfect characters
🞄You can put hats on the Alien Rarecrow, your horse, and your child
🞄Lots of mods

Cons:
🞄Lackluster friendship system
🞄Takes a while to get into
🞄Days don't last very long which can stress out some people
🞄No tutorial, but for a game centered around interacting with the community, is quite poetic in my opinion

Some nitpicks:
🞄It's too easy to accidentally delete items
🞄You can't mark items as favorite like in Terraria
🞄Trash can instantly gets rid of items instead of keeping them until you add another item (like Terraria)


All in all, it's one of my top games, up there with Terraria, Enter/Exit the Gungeon, etc. 9/10

"
13599,"50 whole hours of my life spent barely touching anything important, i just want the fucken sporty guy with the silly smile"
13600,"hehe farbm,in:)))"
13601,"Lots of variety in crops, multiple methods of making money, lots of interesting events, hidden features, and it's difficult to run out of things to do. 

However, you can't drive a tractor. 0/10."
13602,good game
13603,"fun and chill game with many directions to go, the ability to play the game at my own pace makes the game so peaceful compared to other games. /b Thanks RTgame for giving me such a game to enjoy.
"
13604,Yeet
13605,I like chickens
13606,I love the calm aspect of the game <3
13607,farm go brrr
13608,ta chido
13609,"I'm sorry but if you think this game is not worth your attention you're goofy. One of the best games for de-balancing combined with creating relationships in the city. In addition, a lot of tasks and curiosities in the game. I'm amazed"
13610,"Fun farming game with some fantasy elements like monsters - however some of the fantasy is just too unbelievable and clashes with the setting, such as with the woman carpenter and her husband, the black scientist. Other than that, the game is enjoyable."
13611,very good game
13612,very fun the quests will keep you occupied for hours without even modding it which is really easy to do
13613,Quite fun single player or with friends

13621,Good
13622,!
13623,"I own this game on pretty much everything I own, that's how much I love this game. I love everything about this game, from the amazing soundtrack to the epic dungeons! After I picked up this game I didn't foresee the amount of time I would spend. Spend playing a game. ""This game is really captivating I never want to leave"", I would say to myself thinking who the hell uses the word captivating, but even then, I never thought much of it. Every time I would put the controller down the game would call me back. The hours that would pass with me staring at my screen. The hours of my life that i'll never get back. This god forsaken game consumes me and everything I live for. It corrupts the very being I call me. But, no matter, it's just a game right? Just a fun game for all. Be careful, It's hungry and craves more. . . MORE. Honestly who needs anything else, It's Stardew F*cking Valley my dudes!"
13624,it's sick bro

13630,you can gay. good game. (penny is best girl)
13631,"This is honestly one of the best games ever. The mechanics are great, the story lines are awesome, and the progression is very balanced. Highly recommend if you are into simulator games."

13636,Oh my god.
13637,hehe funny shadow man go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
13638,"picture this:
me, samson (thats me that is my name) deeply engrossed into the game, i say hello to shane (kiss him on the mouth), plant my crops, pet my animals and i see a black blob moving ever so slightly in my peripheral vision. i think to myself ""a fly? how did you get in here!"" and turn my attention to the (supposed) winged insect. me, not wearing my glasses (blind, oh so very blind) in that split second realise far too late. 
it was not a fly. it was a spider. it falls off its silk line and flails just inches from my arm and starts fucking booking it. i jump up, start freaking out (obviously) and try to reach for something, anything! i grab a cup and try to trap the would be assassin but it runs and oh god does it run. we have a standoff, staring into each other's eyes (romantically?) and it scurries away between the trinkets sat on my desk. i panic and start moving things around, shaking like a leaf but i cant find it. my eyes water and my knees are about to give out. i step back for a moment, devise a game plan. bug killer? shoe? what do i even do once i find it? am i even allowed to take another's life? maybe this spider is just like me. maybe it has dreams, a family, a life it wants to live. but i have no time to think about that. i don't know what kind of guy this thing is! what if it's venomous? what if there's more of them? i have to find it. and i have to find it fast. i gather myself, picking up the cup once again. i slowly move the items sitting on my desk, caution in every move i make. 

it's either me or the spider. 

i get to the last few things and go to pick up my junimo plush (hehe). i grab it with both hands, looking where it once stood. and thats when i realise my mistake. the spider was on the junimo plush. waiting. lurking. right. next. to. my. hand. i breathe in, removing a hand and reach for the cup. 

IT'S EITHER ME OR THE SPIDER. 

i SLAM the cup onto the junimo causing the spider to start running, panicked. we make eye contact through the glass and it stops. it seems to have accepted its fate. i flip over the junimo/cup and start shaking it, trying to get the spider to fall into the glass. it falls and sits at the bottom of the cup, defeated. i've won. i sit there for a while. unmoving. it takes me a bit but i eventually get up and take the spider outside. as it scurries out of the glass we meet eyes yet again.. we have a moment. and then it gallops into the distance. i step back inside, the loss looming over me, but it was the right thing to do. we're from different worlds, different walks of life. and i accept that. 
i walk back to my room, melancholic, filled with sorrow and sit down at my desk. i glance to the place where i first saw it. i think back to all the memories we shared, all the glances between us... and i feel empty. all those moments are in the past and i have to move on. i wipe my tears, compose myself, and stare back at my screen. at some point during the struggle i had paused my game, 4:20pm. i straighten my back and put on my headphones. i rest my hands on my keyboard and mouse and unpause.

and then i forget all about it and play the rest of the day. recommended! very good game"
13639,it is fun.
13640,"Anytime I can procure ducks, whether in a video game or real life, I am implored (also legally bound) to say that whatever it is that allowed to me to procure said ducks, is nothing short of a miracle. Stardew Valley allowed me to procure, and keep ducks. They lay eggs, they don't do much else, I named one Beyonce, and I would do it all over again. Get this game if you enjoy ducks, you won't quacking regret it."
13641,"very fun, but more fun with mods for people like me with severe adhd"
13642,i have nothing bad to say about this game. it is literally perfect in EVERY WAY. 20/10 i love it!

13646,very good
13647,Yes
13648,lovely faming sim
13649,If you play you may not want to stop playing. Oops.
13650,I love the peacefulness and wholesome charm of this game its nearly as incapsulating as minecraft was for me growing up :)
13651,"The game's fine, definitely overhyped, it's an Americanized knockoff of Harvest Moon [spoiler](I absolutely guarantee the dev lives somewhere in the western US, in a big city, probably paying $1000+ a month in a tiny apartment. The game definitely gives that feeling),[/spoiler] somewhere in the early Rune Factory days, back when they were starting to realize RPG mechanics would be a fun thing to add to the franchise, but hadn't yet fleshed it out.

I'm a bit too late to give a heartfelt, proper review, but the gist of it is that it's like the games I mentioned, but missing a lot of the innocence and fun; you know, lots of hamfisted stuff about evil corporations with too much power, NPCs cheating on each other and such, and weird balancing issues like the starter sprinklers being worthless and the only weapons worth using being swords (despite there being four weapon types).

Yadda yadda, you get the idea. Fad game, solid 6/10, big modding community, whatever.
Would've given it a no, but you can definitely tell the game's made by one person. If I find out later that it's made by a team, I'll change it to a no, but in the meantime, yes."
13652,I love this game! Very fun to play by myself or with friends.
13653,Farming. :)

Farm or forage, mine or fish. There's always something to find and something to do! In some ways it reminds me of the old nintendo pokemon games! Love love love"
13672,"great game for someones passion project, keep the updates rolling"
13673,hehe chimkin round
13674,Maravilhoso
13675,Greates Gmae Evr
13676,Great game! Very relaxing and yes! :D
13677,"I have Stardew Valley on PC, iOS and Switch. I paid for all three separately. That alone should speak to how much I love this game. 

Since I've previously only played on the iOS and Switch versions, I've never used mods before. Let me tell you - they are life-changing. My farm has never looked more beautiful. 

The game is fun, the community is great, and there's a ton of replayability. Whether you go for min/max and organize the heck out of your day or just simply throw caution to the wind and enjoy your life doing only one thing at a time, it's all up to you. There's never any real pressure or deadlines - unless you want them yourself. It's a game you can pick up and drop whenever you want and if you get tired or want something new, you can start all over and I appreciate that. 

10/10"
13678,Is great game.
13679,This is a good game for sure. I thought I was done by the second year but boy was I mistaken.
13680,Awesome

13682,Good.
13683,play it the way it wants you to for a better experience
13684,it's stardew valley what more do you need to know
13685,Yes
13686,This game starts off so addicting. Each and every character is designed perfectly and their character arcs are all executed with perfection. Gets a little less entertaining after a while but has high replayability. Overall just a very cute and entertaining game.
13687,great cute game.
13688,It is the most delightful game
13689,yummmm
13690,"farming simulator 8-bit edition

13694,"way more fun then terraria, i dont know why i never got this game until now"
13695,"When i play this game. I can feel my remaining 2 braincells slowly releasing seratonin into what is left of my small small brain. The animals are cute, the people are pretty cool and the world is expansive and full of neat secrets. I played this game for over a hundred hours and switch and godamnit im gonna play hundreds of more on PC."
13696,"I like how chill most of the game is, and building my own farm just makes me happy for some reason."

13705,"very fun! i went into the game absolutely blind and i understand pretty much everything off the bat, and for the things i dont understand, the wiki covers it!"
13706,10/10 lore
13707,"Okay, so i really didn't played it much on the PC but i played it much on the Nintendo Switch and the XBOX Series X and this Game is just amazing. The Graphics is gorgeous and doesn't need a gaming PC to run this Game, the Story and NPC's in the Game are just great and the Things you can do in the Game is just WOW. You can go fishing, farming Stuff on your Farm, mining Materials in the MIne, fighting Monsters in the Mine, create friendships with those NPC's and so much more by just 1 Developer. This is Gem and you should get it."
13708,"Very relaxing but still a very intricate game. Lots to learn, dig deep into, and to occupy your time with."
13709,Great game
13710,pog
13711,"One of my favorite games for relaxing! You can play it however you want - a daring adventurer, a peaceful farmer, a lonely fisherman, the town flirt. Plenty of quests to follow, back stories to unlock, and goals to achieve. Great game! I hope they consider making similar games in other settings. Would love to see some new valleys with different characters and back stories - big city, old west ghost town, sci-fi or fantasy world, etc.! Would farm in any valley created by these folks!"
13712,Simp simulator.
13713,"I'm still quite surprised by this game. A game made by an individual developer turned out to be much better than I imagined. I'm not a big fan of the RPGs that have come out recently, but this game has refreshed my perception of the field. In terms of gameplay, it basically revolves around farming. The things you start with are a piece of land and a house, and you can choose between them because they have different properties. My favorite part was interacting with these NPCs because they were so much fun. So overall, the game was very unexpected and I think Eric Barone did a really good job."

13715,"Fantastic game filled with hundreds of hours of content. If you enjoy Animal Crossing, this title is a must include in your colletion!"
13716,"This isn't just harvest moon like I thought it would be, the game is huge and very profound at times, I really enjoy playing it and I usually don't like playing games, but this one just feels so personal and happy, it makes me chill and forget all my problems for some time, and also since each day lasts for like 20min irl time, and you can only save at the end of each day, it ends up being a great game for when I just wanna take a quick break from homework. I'd 100% recommend this game to everyone ever, really good."
13717,IT'S RAINING
13718,why is Shane such a lil bish?
13719,A fantastic relaxing game for all ages.
13720,"Strongly recommend! Literally a time killer, I am on my fourth year and yet there are still so many things to do! Funny thing is, I think I made the character even busier than before, get up at 6 am, go to bed at 2 am, no day-off no vacation. My character must regret quitting job to take the farm XD."
13721,卐
13722,"I have never had a cat in my life, but after I chose to have a dog on here.
I have never been so sure of how faithful a dog's companionship can be.
I went 2 and a half years without realising I could fill up his water and he still ended up loving me.
I don't think a cat would be that understating and because of this I think dogs truly are man's best friend."

13729,"This game is not only very addicting and fun, serving as my personal favorite method of escapism, but also includes interesting and endearing character interactions. If you want a farming sim with plenty of depth and a pick-up-and-play style, this game is flawless."
13730,"Stardew Valley is a game with a simple concept that's easy to get into. It features a memorable cast of characters and decent variety in its gameplay. There's plenty to do for players who want to fully complete the game, as well as incentives to restart from the beginning and experience things in a different way. The day-to-day farm life offers a relaxing escape from the real world, while the dungeon-like mines are great for players who want a more thrilling experience. 
If I had one complaint, it would be that the characters, while lovely, begin to lose their charm as dozens of hours are put into the game. Dialogue becomes repetitive, and even marriage starts to feel stale after a while."
13731,"there was no tutorial for most things, i had to keep looking up tutorials on yt"
13732,yes
13733,it good i enjoy

13754,"The glorious Communist State Ministry of Agriculture has, in recognition of my exemplary service during the Invasion of Chechnya and my loyalty to both Lenin and the state's Bolshevik ideals. has awarded me 4 acres of land in the North Ossetia-Alania Oblast, a dominantly Russian-speaking Village called Stardew Valley. With the spirit of our great Bolshevik Party, I have cultivated the land to provide for our great Communist [strike] empire [/strike] collective, and have driven the corrupt, perverse capitalist from our village. Long Live Lenin and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"

13765,"It is definitely a game to play when you get off work or to relax. Its just farming, fishing and meeting people. You can do what you want for the most part while staying in the base game. Its an absolutely wonderful way to wind down."
13766,Favorite Game!! i play it more on the xbox and switch! i need a better computer at the moment!
13767,"very relaxing and fun game to play with frens, 0/10 would not recommend"
13768,absolutely worth it
13769,"It was fun playing this game with Termite-kun for the first time. The graphic configuration is simple but cute, which can be customized according to preferences. The game has many missions and each one is a journey, a small story of the characters in the game. Termite and I have small houses ( far far away from town), with a large field ( full of flowers and fruits) in the front yard, a chicken coop, and we have a little cutie cat. Termite is always good at this game, he always catches rare fish, and I often get teased for only catching seaweeds. On rainy days, Termite and I would go into caves to fight monsters, and dig mines. Another special thing is that the game has seasonal festivals. There are always special items, interesting little activities here. For me, Stardew Valley is a miniature model of farm life that I can find feelings of peace, and the melodious music and sound took me away from the hustle and bustle of reality."
13770,2d Minecraft and I love it! Also u can get a girlfriend!?!?!?!!! WOWZERS

13802,its ok
13803,"I found this game years after the hype, and I can see why it's so well loved. 

There are myriads of ways to play this game. You can stay on your farm and farm to your heart content, or you can spend your time mining, or maybe you prefer fishing! Base game has, if I remember correctly 5 different farms to start on, from a basic all around little bit of everything farm, to one that is more for fishing, and another that has a rock spawn. 

There is tons of NPC's to become friends with, and even marry eventually. Slowly getting to know everyone is such a treat. 

It's a great little slice of life sim that is great to pop into and relax"

13828,"A good way to run away from real life and actually chill. 
I just started and i'm having so much fun...not that many games give me the PS1 games vibe...but this one does. 
For people that like minecraft this can be a good game...and if you have people to play with you, then you will have a blast!
It is a very easy game in terms of interface, so almost everyone (with exeprience or not) can easely play it.
The game has lots of things...so don't feel overwelmed if you need to watch videos or ask for help...THIS IS A WORLD!"

PS: I now primarily play it on mobile and so my played time here is not a true reflection of my time playing Stardew Valley. My mobile time is way more by now."

13883,"This is seriously such a cute game. It can be as complex or as simple as you would like it to be. It is a very relaxing game and there is so much content in such a little bundle.

13891,One of my favorite games by far and has gotten me through many rough days including today. I highly recommend this game. Don't let the looks fool it. The game mechanics and stories are by far one of the best.
13892,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLAY THIS
13893,"I have the switch version of this as well, I like the game so much I have it on every platform, that should speak volumes about this game. It's really fun and you don't feel forced to do anything, you can just plant crops and avoid human interaction or forage your way through the game, the mining is fun, probably one of my favourite aspects of the game. I highly recommend it, it's lightweight and provides hours of entertainment."
13894,"Objectively, this is a very good game, relaxing and experiencing the feeling of being a farmer, but

i bought 1 version on ios and it has savebackup mode, please add this mode to PC version, because every time want to backup game without save backup mode, player will have to go to sleep to finish End of the day and this is really inconvenient, please fix this"

If you want to explore the mines fighting dangerous mobs along the way do it! If you want to take a more relaxed approach and meet and become friends with NPCs while earning money by farming do it!

13910,"I used to play this game on an Ipad. My friend let me know that the PC version has more content and is co-op-able. So, when I have a chance, the game is on sale, and I finally have some free time. I bought the game without second thought. The story is nice, the art is cute. The game controlling experience is good, I'm more of a mobile  games person, but it is not too difficult to get use to PC control.
I did encounter an issue tho, I had sound issue. It's like a zz sound (how to explain this.. like a broken TV sound, if you know what I mean TT). I don't know how to fix it. I tried deleted the game and re-down load, and restart my PC, but both didn't help.
I would still recommend the game tho. I'll figure out how to fix the sound issue later."

If you like calming games with interesting characters and stories, and simple to learn gameplay mechanics, you'll love Stardew Valley!"
13914,"I love how relaxing yet challenging it is. You can chill out and fish all day or explore mines and fight monsters. The main story line is cute and intriguing, Plus there are tons of fun side story lines that keep everything interesting."

13961,If you play it you can't stop
13962,"Just a chill farming sim. Runs smoothly, has joyful music, as well as dynamic characters to build relationships with. Across multiple platforms, I've spent close to 300 hours playing this game, and it is definitely one of my favorites."
13963,I loved everything. This game is Stellar. I am a stardew valley fan. If Stardew Valley has millions of fans I am one of them. If they have no fans I am dead. <3
13964,"no matter what i am going through in life whether it be the happiest or saddest ive ever been, stardew valley is one of the few things that is able to consistently keep me relaxed and make me happy.  thank you so much concernedape for all your hard work!!"

13966,fish
13967,"11/10, cute game! It's very peaceful, but you can also go in the caves and fight monsters if you'd like. I love the festivals, ability to romance and make friends with characters, etc! It's a well-rounded, great game! I'd definitely recommend giving it a play.

(P.S: Shane isn't so bad once you get to know him- ;0)"

13973,"Nearly 500 hours in, the only issues I have is that I don't have enough friends to play co-op with!"
13974,"Love this game! that much that I also have this on PlayStation :)
It's one of those games where you can just chill out & play.. Minutes turn into hours :D
You can have a friend come play too & help you out on your farm. 
I play with my sister who is also a massive fan of the game lol she was the one that got me into it <3"
13975,I love it
13976,"This game made my 3 week quarantine feel like 2 days. Great game, recommend to anyone thats looking for a slower paced game."
13977,good
13978,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
13979,"great game nothing on the market place like it
"
13980,Calming game with short and long term goals to keep play engaging. I used to play years ago & I really like the updates to the game.
13981,Fun and relaxing game to play by yourself or with friends
13982,"an insanely great game with an addictive play style that has even veterans coming back for more
totally recommend this game to really anyone, as it is fun as it is versatile ^^"
13983,"Stardew Valley is one of the best, entertaining games I have ever played. I deffinatly beleive it's worth buying, and there's always something to do on Stardew (Unless you play 24/7). The style is beautiful, and it's a peacful, fun game to play."
13984,This is the best update to Fortnite in years!!!!
13985,Verycute
13986,It is a family staple now. We allll play - even mom!!
13987,good
13988,it was hard at the start but then got really fun
13989,comfiest game on steam
13990,"There is just so much to do, it basically never gets boring.
Even if the main goal is achieved you get many small ""sidequests"" that keep you going.

The NPCs are written in a way that represents actual human relationships, the better you know someone the more you understand why they were behaving in a certain way in the beginning.

The options on how to play the game can be adjusted to the player.
You want it cozy, relax sit back and talk to the NPC.
Wanna do it speedrun style? -what are you waiting for hurry up!

One of my favourite games!"
13991,"I wasn't sure if I'd like this game at first because I don't usually enjoy RPG games like this, but man was I wrong. This game is basically perfect. It's a one-person game, which makes it even more impressive; the art style is unique and amazing, and I personally adore it. It's essentially a farming simulator with a unique story; you begin as a worker in an office at Joja Mart, which is similar to Amazon in real life, except this time it's the evil corporation. Anyway, you get tired of working at Joja and decide to go to the plot of land in the small town of Stardew Valley, To begin, you are greeted with a farm and some money known as ""gold,"" which you inherited from your grandfather. The first thing you should do is talk to all of the NPCs. In Stardew Valley, there is a store called Pierre's General Store that competes with Joja. You can either support Pierre or sell your soul to the devil and go with Joja."
13992,LOVELY!
13993,Is good
13994,yes
13995,"Love this game! On my other account I had almost 1k hours, I first got it many years ago and still love it!"
13996,GOOD GAME
13997,So far I have been thoroughly enjoying this game. It is for sure worth the purchase.
13998,"amazing game, just don't ignore the community center"
13999,"Hours of fun, and mods for days."
14000,i can get absorbed into this game for days at a time- dangerous
14001,"Very fun game, suitable for casual or serious players. Can just tootle around vibing or alternatively you can play in a focused manner to achieve things. Personally, I love that it is kind to me as a not-very-good gamer. It's very relaxing to hang out on my virtual farm, making unrealistic amounts of money selling vegetables, and trying to befriend the locals. This game got me through lockdown, and I still love it!"
14002,My favorite game of all time. So relaxing but you can also play it in a more stressful way if thats what you're into :)
14003,Enjoy chilling
14004,"Amazing Game, just so much to do its crazy that just one person made this giant game"
14005,I’m addicted to this game. It’s so good!

14013,it good
14014,"A must play for people struggling with stress. It is a lovely, heartwarming game I have fallen in love with and plan to play for many more hours. The only issue I have is that there is an artifact missing in the museum so not every slot is filled!"
14015,It's addictive ! Just play already ;)
14016,blue chimkens <3
14017,"A comfort game if ever there was one. 

I have been playing stardew valley for about 7-8 years and I can still say with absolute confidence that it is one of my absolute favourite games ever. It really was worth every penny. I even got my sister, who doesn't really play games, hooked. (And I'm planning to get my boyfriend into it too.) From character creation to romancing and friending people in the community, its beautiful and I will always always recommend it. The array of characters you get to meet, the stories, the development between you and the town and farming at your own leisure? There's also no wrong way to play this game which is great! And the fact that they introduced multiplayer so now you can play with friends and experience it together? 200/10! (And can I just say: Sebastian 😌👌❤.)

If you haven't played this yet or you're wondering if its worth it, this is your sign. Go for it. You won't be disappointed. It's literally a game for everyone."
14018,gud
14019,Relatively open play with lots of different styles for people who are after slightly different things but an all together cute calm game to play casually. Its honestly everything I want in a game at the moment.
14020,farm time
14021,It's good.
14022,"If you like the Harvest Moon games, you will love this. 9/10, gg"
14023,very nice. always more to do. what's that? 100% completion? start over and spend another 2 years on the same farmer.
14024,i love my goats
14025,"if you wanted Harvest Moon but overcomplicated, you've got it."
14026,casual and comfy
14027,shane best boy
14028,"Do I recommend this game? Abso-fucking-lutely, and here's why: It got my brother hooked, even though he's usually not the type of guy to enjoy playing anything besides League of Legends or Minecraft. Granted, he would spend most days in the mine, just breaking down rocks and killing monsters, but I would be lying if I didn't appreciate the bug meat. I also restarted the game so many times because I just couldn't decide who to romance. I'm now Sam's boyfriend, because I forgot to change my gender to female, but it works nonetheless. I will probably romance Sebastian next. Why? Because he's just so damn cute. Or Elliott, because those luscious locks need a farmer GF. Or maybe Shane... I CANNOT DECIDE.

Anyway, hard recommend. Would wanna play it for the first time again.
xoxo"
14029,I spent almost 100 hours on this game I think that says something.
14030,11/10 <3
14031,"The game has made me even more productive in real life, if you want a relaxing game that can motivate you to do things, this is the game!"

14043,"loved it, got addicted quite quickly but it can be a depressing game and i wish there were more variations and options"
14044,"This game goes beyond a farming sim. This game is absolutely packed with content and you will find your selves playing for hours on end. Easily the best ""farm sim"" of all time."
14045,leah

14055,很难想起这本是个休闲游戏。
14056,Just wonderful.Thanks concernedape. The ginger island stuff seems a bit colonising though but its not done with any iintent of harm just could use some diversity. Gameplay is absolutely amazing! Big fan
14057,love art work.
14058,Fantastic game with a great soundtrack and a relaxed vibe
14059,Best indie game ever!!! Can't believe it's made by 1 person. ConcernedApe ur the best!
14060,farmer dating sim makes the big sad go away

14069,get it. get it now.
14070,.
14071,Farm
14072,"An easy game to slip into playing. After the 2nd year or so things get a bit stale, though. I recommend that you avoid min-maxing unless you want to speed run the endgame, which stupid expensive. I used an online planner to restructure my farm and it ended up one giant sty."
14073,Pog
14074,"pretty pog ngl
"
14075,this is what i call addiction i have it on every device i own i would recommend only if you like farming and spending time on 1 game at a time its slow paced but really addicting omg like its beautiful i say the price is worth it the price quite cheap as of when i bought this game. p.s i love playing this on a rainy day its amazing
14076,this game is the best thing that ever happened to the universe and humans don't deserve it. it is on another plane of goodness like puppies and sunrises are. infinite out of ten stars
14077,"This game is NOT a Harvest Moon clone.  It basically just took everything I liked about the 2 Harvest Moon games I played, slapped them together, and gave me so much more than Harvest Moon ever really did tbh.  Absolute banger if you like fantasy/farming/fantasy-farming games."
14078,fishing
14079,phenomenal
14080,"One of favorite games that I consider also as one of my comfort ones. Lot to explore, do, go at your own pace and just relax while playing it. Absolutely would recommend this game!~ (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤"
14081,"Game is so addicting
"
14082,I wanna live in this game
14083,"I don't even enjoy farming simulators that much, but all the different ways you can farm, make money and have fun really make up for that. You can just find your own way to do everything, and it all gets easier once you get upgrades and start automizing stuff. The combat is also fun and there's actually more story to it than you would imagine. I've been playing co-op since the beginning, which is also a wonderful feature. It's really worth it!"
14084,great game
14085,"I've never even beaten this game. I don't even care. This is probably my favourite game ever. Literally my only complaint is that I'm not the biggest fan of the dirt colour, and that's not even a valid complaint. I couldn't recommend this game enough."
14086,you cant see krobus naked and it makes me sad
14087,"its a cute lil game, love to play co-op with friends!"
14088,...
14089,"This is the greatest game ever made, if you wish to experience serotonin play stardew valley"
14090,"Honestly, man Penny is the best waifu, doesn't ask for much, has the cutest children, is a redhead with freckles, and out of every Stardew character, honestly... Nvm, nvm.

Legit review now, this game is great, and has amazing grinding because they did what No Man's Sky never could. That's right, they made grinding actually fun, especially the mines, and the dating sim part of it. Man, honestly this game has it all, it makes you feel so sad, because real life doesn't have it all.

There's no Penny in real life."
14091,I really love this game <3 It helps you relax. You should try it!
14092,"Stardew Valley has taken up too much of my time on Xbox, so it will take up even more of my time on Steam."
14093,More fun than I thought it'd be
14094,i have an addiction help
14095,Stardew Valley has so much to do and discover. It's such a nice and cozy game to play by yourself or with friends. I also love that is has so much depth to it. I come back to this game time and time again. It's my all time favorite.
14096,I don't need real human interaction anymore
14097,"The game has a certain calm feel about good for people who don't like raging

14111,it is fun
14112,"Cute, cozy, and addicting!"
14113,It is very fun and exciting!!
14114,"One of the most wholesome and amazing experiences one can hope for. An incredibly fun and complete game, where at every milestone, you have a sense of accomplishment and new challenges. Definitely a 10/10."
14115,Absolutely beautiful game. Add some mods and recolors and its the best thing ever

14126,"I really turned ""living as if I'm inside Stardew Valley"" into my #1 goal for life. Yes, I need a pretty farm. Of course, I need friends and a partner. And obviously, I must have a cool soundtrack for my dream-like existence."
14127,"This is your sign to stop looking at reviews and buy the game. I'll promise you won't regret it!

Long story short, loved this game trough and trough, ,it's immense fun and something that you must experience at least once in your lifetime. I'm not one who would play with indie RPGs so this game was left for many years gathering dust in my library...but once I started playing, oh boy was I hooked.

You may not necessarily know what to do at first but don't get scared, just as in life, you'll figure it out. Besides the introduction, there is no predefined story. You'll get hints but they will just guide you. This is YOUR adventure. The choices are yours.

I won't say any more. Go and experience it for yourself. You're welcome!

Highly recommend the game. :)"

14145,i like it
14146,"ConcernedApe is a beast. This game is a lesson in game design not only for farming sims but to every game. I have it on Steam, Android and I'm gonna buy it on Switch as well. That's how good it is."
14147,"If Stardew Valley has millions of fans I am one of them. If Stardew Valley has ten fans I am one of them. If Stardew Valley has only one fan and that is me. If Stardew Valley has no fans, that means I am no more on the earth. If the world is against Stardew Valley, I am against the world. I love Stardew Valley  till my last breath."

14175,"AH SO GOOD. It's a game where you can just grind and build your farm for hours and still be entertained. 
     There is endless things to do in this game, cave exploring, fishing, harvesting, and building relationships with the townspeople. I'd recommend everyday."
14176,It's simple yet so entertaining and captivaiting.
14177,yes
14178,cured my depression
14179,"This game is a little bit.... T H I C C
Recommend it to everyone its very instructive and fun!
Check the game and explore it alone in single player or in co-op mode!"
14180,"Honestly one of the greatest and most fun games that I have ever played. If you like adventure, story, rpg or farming games, you won't be disappointed with it. Highly recommended."
14181,This game is Soooo goood. Its rare to find a game thats sucks you so much
14182,based cool and also pog
14183,I really should have gotten this sooner. It's easy enough to work out how the game works but there are different ways you can do things so it doesn't feel stale. Can easily sink in hours at a time and very fun to play with friends!
14184,Grandpapa dies so sad but then you get a free farm in a quirky village where you can be friends with everyone by bribing them with their favorite things. Dominate the children during Easter by collecting all the eggs and buying the toys for yourself. You are not allowed to marry the #1 bachelor Linus unfortunately we all tried sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
14185,: D
14186,"I have purchased this game on pretty much every device I can play it on. it's a work of art. If you are unsure how you feel about pixel art, I was as well and this is the game that made me realize that it's not that bad. You can play at your pace whether that be super fast or very chill. Honestly believe that this is one of the best games ever made (don't come at me I'm not a big gamer)."
14187,10/10 would cuck an emo again

14190,"This is a very addicting game! You will always say ""Just one more day."" next thing you know it is the next season and you should have gone to bed 2 hours ago! Highly recommended."
14191,its like animal crossing but better
14192,"Is good, can fish"
14193,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
14194,yes
14195,n1ce
14196,"Honestly I don't know who doesn't have this game already installed. Get it, it's too cozy."
14197,"Addicting and so fun, worth a try for anyone looking for chill game to relax to. And if you like ranching or farming games to get lost in."
14198,"If you need a Chilling Game, Relaxing or need a Slow life Game. Yup This game is what you are looking for."
14199,very nice love everything/everyone except joja and Pierre

14201,"The game's settings are saved in the save file, so when deleting the default_option or startup_preferences file, the Genneral setting is not reset. I need a button that can reset everything in settings."

14208,"I love how cosy the game aesthetics are, the detailed storyline is also a bonus as I usually get bored pretty quickly so this makes it much more interesting and makes me want to play more."
14209,This game quite literally cured my depression
14210,"Lewis forced me to write this review

14222,Why can I date 20 npc's at once
14223,A lot of fun. Currently playing with the Forest farm layout
14224,There's a lot you can do in this game while still being a good way to slow down and relax. It's worth checking out.
14225,This game has me acting like Joe Goldberg.
14226,simple but fun game. if you like animal crossing or just super chill games then you'll love this.
14227,"Pure goodness. This game is what games should be - you play it and it makes you feel better when you are upset. You play it - and you want to play again. Its is calm, kind and entertaining. Great multiplayer."
14228,Es muy divertido y yo quisiera jugar más. Gracias por los momentos de feliz cuando yo jugar Stardew Valley. ¡Besos y Abrazos!
14229,comfy game makes me happy while playing luv this game sm<3
14230,I made Shrek in the game.
14231,one of the best games ever made
14232,yes
14233,"incredible for the price, countless hours of joy <3 never thought anything could come close to the sims 4 for me as a life sim, but stardew is special"
14234,"Love the aspect of open world exploration. I also like they took inspiration from terreria and the ""old"" like 2d gameplay!"
14235,This is absolutely my favorite game of all time. It's a seriously feel-good comfort game that I've consistently come back to since it first came out. Couldn't possibly speak highly enough about it :)
14236,"Dont know if you can tell by my playtime, but this game is the best. its so entrancing to play day after day. seeing the gold rack up, relationships made. It is an amazing escape. customization is everywhere in this game. AMAZING!!! and the sound design <3"
14237,"big farm big farm big farm big farm big farm
"
14238,19 Hours after 2-3 days of having it installed. Love it. So relaxing.        Edit: 9 days and 58 hours later. Still in love
14239,Fun
14240,"First, I appreciate that this game is amazing amounts of fun for some people. For those people, I wish them all of the happiness possible with replay after replay of this game. I congratulate ConcernedApe as an independent game developer and admire the effort and quality of the product put out. I am delighted a loyal fandom has gathered around this game, and I wish the Stardew Valley fandom only the best.

For a gamer like me, this game is the opposite of fun.

This game is brutally hard work. Its mechanics are finicky and frustrating. It's a miserable experience despite the hope that each new attempt at the first two months of gameplay won't be horrible. (It always is.) I hate the stress of playing it. I hate the feeling of utter failure every day in game. I absolutely loathe the fishing game mechanic; it's sloppy. Sometimes the reload decides to just halve my day's energy even if I went to sleep on time. I appreciate there are mods out there, but if I have to mod a game (and risk my computer's security) on the remote chance I might eventually enjoy it, then that misses the point.

So for gamers like me who are looking for a relaxing and casual time with a sim RPG to get away from the stress of everyday life, then I cannot recommend Stardew Valley. For sim rpg gamers looking for an immersive and brutally challenging RPG that has a broad array of modifications and a solid fandom, this just may be the game and community they've been looking for."
14241,"I have around 180hrs on mobile and recently got it on PC and this is literally my favorite game ever. My relationships have decayed. I haven't seen the sun in a month. However, I married Abigail so I think it's a fair trade off."
14242,"imma be honest, i dont dislike that much in this game. the only thing i dont like is the fact that i got swarmed by bugs while mining and i almost lost all of my health, but i think thats just me sucking at the game"
14243,"This is one of the most enjoyable experiences ever. I love this game, i love the characters, i love the music, its all perfect. a MUST buy. This is one of the best games ever"

14249,very fun epic
14250,plant water sleep repeat and occasionally sell would farm again
14251,"An easy going game to pass the time. You can have a movie on in the background while you explore your maps and learn about your neighbors. Also a really fun time if playing with friends. You can focus on Farming, Fishing, Mining and more in this fun game!"
14252,sooooooo fun!
14253,Sim
14254,I really like the large aspects that the game includes
14255,fun farm game

14261,funny shadow man in sewers make pants tighter
14262,"100+ hours on PlayStation and I decided to buy it on Steam/Desktop as well. Absolutely love this game, it's a great cozy game, with enough filters and settings you can change to give yourself a challenge. If you're that kind of gamer. Also great as a co-op game if you're like me and love to build and have a friend(s) who love to harvest/mine. Old Minecraft friends? This is the chill after work game for us burnt out adults."
14263,This game is down right relaxing. I purchased it for steam and switch. Sometimes I like to just sit and play a cozy game without stress and this is one of THE BEST when it comes to de-stressing. This and animal crossing are really great cozy games.
14264,This is my favorite game. It always puts me in a good mood and helps with my depression.

14276,yes
14277,"good game, very nice
"
14278,"Very fun game, there is much to do and see. Farming and all of the other activities have so much depth to them. Co-op could use some work, the fact that I disconnect from a friends farm every ten minutes is very infuriating. Attempted every possible ""fix"" and the issue wasn't resolved. Despite the co-op issue, I recommend you play this game."
14279,good
14280,"one of my favorite games, and it inspired my love of pixel art!"
14281,uwu
14282,"Farm.
Absolutely bussin."
14283,"I play this game with my girlfriend. I introduced her to Stardew Valley a little while back when I created a world on my Switch which we would play split-screen multiplayer on and she really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, we live seven hours away from each other and only visit once per couple of months so it can be hard finding things to do together when we're not together. Luckily, this game has streamlined multiplayer (one person hosts a saved game on their PC through the click of a button and the others join) making it easy for us to play together. She's too scared to go in the mines so I mine for the both of us :)"
14284,If you have played Animal Crossing before then you are going to love this game expanded with a variety of things to do.
14285,"I HATED THIS GAME AT FIRST, then i played it again after i got the xbox game pass. i played for 40 hours on xbox then bought for steam and played 30 more. No regrets 11/10 game"

"
14293,"Such a good game, very similar to harvest moon"
14294,"I'm a little obsessed with this game, as you might see by the hours played, lol. I've had it since the game came out, and its one I always come back to just to relax and ease off some stress. I tend to start new games just to check out the recent updates, which have all been consistently fantastic, and recently I've been getting into the mods developed by the community for some extra fun. Even after playing it for this long, its never gotten boring."
14295,"I love this game, and co-op with friends is a blast. it's well made- but i usually play modded because i like the customization."
14296,Farming :)

14311,"This game is some of the most laidback, relaxed time I've ever had in game. Either use a wiki or go in blind, it doesn't matter. You'll have tons and tons and tons of content. I have 78 hours in this game and I [i]still[/i] have tons of stuff to accomplish in the main game. Not to mention the soundtrack, which is a perfect accompaniment to the relaxed, comfy style of the game. A perfect little farming slice of life. Absolutely worth the 15 bucks."

14332,"Stardew is an excellent, entertaining game if you ever need something slow and relaxing, at times it can get intense but the overall vibe of the game is genuinely mesmerizing. The Steam achievements also encourage you to keep playing, which is great. Definitely helpful whenever I don't feel like playing fast-paced games."
14333,It's nice and relaxing
14334,gud farm game
14335,Obviously one of the best games of its kind.  Love it.

14343,"One of the greatest games I have ever played. Besides Minecraft, it is pretty much the only game I have gotten my non-gamer wife to love. Its artstyle is iconic. The modding community is supported. It runs on nearly any system. I fall in love with it over and over again."
14344,10/10 would break shane's emotional wall again.
14345,Yay... another addicting game to add to my laziness.
14346,"Excellent game, I don't know what else to say, it's great"
14347,i have a problem :33
14348,"very chill and nice when you need an escape from your daily life. Also good for people who like to grind and collect achievements while progressing through the story. Different ways to play the game as well: if you like exploring and fighting, you can go in the mines and defeat monsters, if you like farming or foraging or fishing you can do those, if you like learning more about stardew valleys story there's plenty of that, if you want to design a super aesthetic/efficient farm you can do that etc. Also the characters all have pretty interesting backstories. Overall very fun and addicting and lots of stuff to do."
14349,its a fantastic game
14350,Its ok
14351,its amazing

14362,review
14363,Relaxes the hell out of me
14364,Game lags often even if I exit and launch it again. My internet speed is not the problem and I am running on a fairly nice device.
14365,"if you like relaxing games, this is for you. it relieves my stress and has lots to do, backstory, romance, mining, farming, etc."
14366," Not good for my anxiety. Not really in my wheelhouse, though I'm an RTS player - this game and its overall popularity had me giving it a go. I can absolutely see why it's so popular, and I could see myself playing it for hundreds of hours if not for one thing - the 14 minute day cycle. As someone who constantly stresses IRL over time, being forced to be in one single place every 14 minutes while still being productive stresses me out. So, reluctantly I'm putting this game down."
14367,d
14368,super chill and relaxing game to play with friends or by yourself. try it with mods. love it

14392,"Amazing Game! I love it. You can be creative with your Farm design, grow crops, mine, fight, take care of animals, make freinds and so on. i have a lot of fun and a lot of content to play. i recommend watching a starters tutorial tho cause for me it was frustrating how few money i had in the beginning, not knowing how ots best to start. also there are very many fun mods to explore on nexus. its also family friendly and fun for all ages. tho id like some better combat options as i am very bad at it. VERY much worth the money, id even pay more for it ( the game is made by one single person btw)"
14393,"Build farms, harvest crops, and murder cave dwelling creatures. But the real treasure are the friends you make along the way."

14400,"For the longest time, I believed this game was not for me. My wife and friends recommended it but always I just told them it didn't seem appealing based on the videos I'd seen from youtubers that showcased or discussed the game. I've played other games that seemed similar like Animal Crossing that weren't really my cup of tea. However, after finally giving in, I played with a friend on Xbox Game Pass for about half an hour before it ended. A week later, I had logged 70 hours of game time. When I am off of it, I start to experience withdrawal symptoms and. Life seems duller when I am not playing. My family relationships are becoming strained and they wonder what is going on. I feel the need to hide my dependency on Stardew Valley from them because I'm not ready to give it up. However, I fear that they will eventually break down the door and get through the barricade so they can force me to have an intervention and possibly commit me to a recovery program."

14416,VERY FUN!! i enjoyy it

14429,"love love love :)
"
14430,hes
14431,When i first bought this game I was obsessed with the idea of it being like Harvest Moon. And then I started to play it. This game has it's own feel and more modern concepts and I love the differing cast of characters.
14432,its a nice game mostly fun with friends. ^-^
14433,good game
14434,love it
14435,"Very fun and entertaining game. Nice to relax and destress. Personally I prefer playing it with friends, but it's also fun to play on your own. If you love games like this I'd definitely reccomend getting it. It's worth the price!"
14436,I can see why this is addictive and such a great game.
14437,Yup
14438,"very relaxing having a lot of fun
"
14439,"Love this game, find it very relaxing."
14440,"It's really fun, and multiplayer is amazing to play."
14441,Stardew Valley is very cash money and I love it very much (no homo).
14442,addicting in a good way
14443,"This game was made extremely well! I recommend it to people who like Harvest Moon, Minecraft, Terraria, or RPG games with friends. Thank you Concerned Ape for this amazing game"
14444,"Good.
"
14445,"Amazing, everyone already knows this."
14446,"If you're a depressed gay or bisexual, you find comfort in games that make you feel needed, and like doing the same thing every day because its nice to know what you're suppose to do, then this is the game for you."
14447,faerm
14448,"This game is super addicting and I can't get enough of it. It will most likely take me another 60 or more hours to finish the first play and after that I want to go play it again but with expanded mod! This game is just too damn good. 

Also Emily is a drug lord."

14452,"This game is the most amazing game I've ever played. there are not words to justly describe this game. the lore is amazing and just the controls are good aswell.

DON'T DESTROY YOUR CROPS WITH A PICKAXE OR AXE"
14453,"When you want a new game but you don't want it to be complicated, you can play this. The more you play, the more complicated it can get, or you can just chill, farming and socializing in a friendly little town. They even have a spa that opens a few days into your first summer. More forgiving than Don't Starve, and more direction than Minecraft. Felt like a nice break for my brain, in the beginning, then addiction set in and I found plenty to do for more hours than I care to admit."
14454,best game
14455,Mods make this game really interesting if you completed it without mods
14456,i've played over 500 hours in this game and have loved every second. Amazing game with so many hidden easter eggs that i'm still finding more even now!

14475,Sometimes I revisit the farm which my ex-gf and I played to remember the good times. But in the end I only remind myself how badly I fcuked up. If I am ever to play the sequel to this game it must be with her or not at all Sadge
14476,This game is very fun and I would definitely recommend it to other people
14477,I can't stop playing this game. Help.

14499,made me start gardening in real life.
14500,"I fell in love with the game on my Switch and had to buy it on PC, I also recommend getting the expanded mod as it just takes this game into a whole other place! If you like games where you will have to do a ton of farming then I say buy this :)"

It is by far the best offering of it's genre, and I've spent hundreds of hours playing this game, idly passing the days in bliss. The developer has added so many free updates since release and the game has something for everyone. 

If you haven't played this game yet, you need to stop denying yourself the experience. buy it now."

14543,Great grindy game to play and chill.
14544," Fun game with a surprising amount of things to do. I've never been a huge fan of laid-back games myself, but this one captivated me. I've yet to marry anyone (though I have my sights on Leah!) but the characters are quite fun. Not sure why none of them like the shiny bars I've been gifting them, though... Personally, I would've been THRILLED if I was given a copper, iron or gold bar!"
14545,yes
14546,"This is a absolutely great game. Though at the time of writing, I have only 20 hours, I have played a ton on my Switch. It is a very , yet exciting farming sim with many other features! 10/10 100% recommended. More than worth the $15."
14547,peaceful
14548,mmmmmmmmm stardew valey game scrumptious
14549,"Imagine a world where fishing, chopping trees, and planting veggies could make you a millionaire in a couple years.  Then look at the reality you live in.  Which is the better one?  I think we all know."
14550,i lovw hot pixel art doctor and farming yass
14551,"If you like farming, socializing, and being the main character of a story, then this game is perfect for you. You can be friends with anyone, but nobody would actually be friends with pierre or clint, right?"
14552,So you are telling me that one guy made everything in this game? And its infinitely more polished than games made by game studios with hundreds of employees? Concernedape is a god among indie devellopers.
14553,Farm
14554,"10/10 Adorable Game
Very Addicting"
14555,the best game i have ever played

14564,"I played 75h in 2 weeks please help, I have COVID and my Stardew Valley addiction is probably my biggest health problem currently"
14565,"I have been playing this game for years. I ALWAYS come back. This game is the definition of ""Comfort"" This is not just a farming sim. This is an in depth game that will have you finding secrets - years later. I will never NOT tell anyone to play this. If you haven't played Stardew Valley, what in the world are you doing? Get to it!"
14566,i want to skin hailey alive then hang her upside down by her toenails
14567,"When i first played it I wasn't to invested and dropped the game after a few in game weeks... I then got bored and gave it another go and it literally sucked up so much of my time to the point my play sessions go well into the night and I only then realize just how hooked I really was. Not to mention it's just a chill game and if you want to you can even play with your pals. Honestly this game truly is a relaxing time and a ton of fun. Honestly I've never been much of a fan of these types of games save for slime rancher, but this is honestly a really nice game to just veg out and relax with. If you're looking for something to take the edge off then I highly recommend this game."
14568,i love this game
14569,"I have played this game for countless hours and I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys farming, crafting, slice of life, relaxing yet challenging gameplay. It feels like there is always something to do. 300+ hours of fun and still much more to come."

14580,very relaxing yet engaging. Well worth the money
14581,Great game
14582,Very fun and addicting! Worth every penny.
14583,"I love this game.  It's simple for casual gamers, but provides depth enough for more mature players who are looking for something other than a shooter or some such."
14584,very fun game to de-stress with
14585,"You can go from ""oh man, I haven't played in a while"" to ""You've played for 10+ hours""

Overall pretty fun :D"
14586,"A friend had gifted me this game a few years ago and although I wasn't too motivated to start this game, it completely and utterly captured me with how fun, engaging, and adorable this game is. This game is one of the greatest games I have ever played and it's a must for every Steam user (especially considering how under-priced it is). You'll find your hours racking up with how much content there is in the base game, and how many mods are out there."
14587,I liked it.
14588,I love romancing pixels while also selling potatoes in bulk
14589,awesome

14594,"its really cool AND WORTH 15$!
Trust me"
14595,"it may say one and a half or so hours but i have like hundreds of hours
anyway
this game is amazing
i can spend hours at a time screw around fishing or mining
maybe farming but that takes hella time
anyway
buy the damn game"
14596,Cool game!
14597,Leah likes driftwood.
14598,"great game, highly recommend it"
14599,it gave me the boyfriend i wished i had 11/10
14600,"just like in real life, stacking grain and cattle will earn you no meaningful admiration among your peers, no real fulfillment to your soul and mental well being. but the relationships that you cultivate with others will bring innumerable joy to life. so please, ConcernedApe, let me marry linus and live in his tent."
14601,Emily  (⁄ ⁄>⁄ω⁄<⁄ ⁄)
14602,"good game, best on multiplayer"
14603,"I enjoy this game to pass the time. I am so grateful for the MODS. OMG, thank you for the pile of MODS. 

I have a hand injury, and on a bad day, that fast timer of a day is not my best friend. The Mod to stop the clock helps me handle playing when my hands are not co-operative. Otherwise, until this sweet handicap-able mod was created, I did have to stop playing because I was tired of hurting myself to get anything done. 

Other mods which help are the seasonal clothing, friendship, changing the look of the animals, the look of the farm. Oh, and the mod for the fishing, another thing which makes me happy I don't have to hurt myself over. 

If you want a huge farm and not have trouble with co-op when someone else doesn't have that same large farm mod, go for the Co-op farm. Best map by far, at least for me. 

Are there improvements to bring to the game? Yes, such as letting kids grow up, have a bit more passage of time somehow with age and events. Even be able to have a couple more holidays or a way to throw a party would be awesome. 

Otherwise, it is fun to organize, plant, and figure how you are going to find all the items, meet the goals, and have some days you just fish away. Don't think this is just a 'kids' game. It isn't. It is for anyone who likes this kind of time management farming set up. 

Have fun, get your mod for a unicorn pony with rainbow hair, and dive into your choice of farm."
14604,"solid game, farming good."
14605,Very  good
14606,cool
14607,"Help, I need to do others things than play this

14610,Cute farming for communism
14611,cute
14612,I like this game because it has quests
14613,"Amazingly done, there is a lot of love that has been put in this game"
14614,"Absolutely amazing game with hours upon hours of entertainment and enthrallment, Stardew is definitely a good one to get if you want to be able to spend hours doing almost anything you can think of, and if the game itself doesn't have it then the amazing modding community will!"
14615,"Enjoyable and relaxing
A game made for those who want a change of pace from any intense moments and just want to chill!
"
14616,Games Good very addictive if you have a goal
14617,<3
14618,great game
14619,"Super relaxing and fun, especially in terms of all the hidden content."
14620,"Fantastic game, doesnt include the other half of my play time on console, meaning i bought this twice. 

If youre like me and have trouble with games without clear end goals, you can always make them for yourself, like doing certain tasks within a certain timeframe, like could you make 1 million gold in a year? that sort of thing. 

That said, i feel people who like people who enjoy taking their time and exploring all the little bits of the game may find this a more enjoyable game.

Mods are fantastic as well, they can even fix grandpas weird bed."
14621,One of the best games ever made. I never get tired of it. Love the options for both singleplayer and multiplayer.
14622,bruh

14629,"This game is great! It’s fun, it’s got a storyline, and it’s also so easy! I love that I can just do my own thing with the farm and the characters. It’s just a really fun game!"
14630,"Best game I have ever played. Stardew valley is an amazing experience where your on a farm and get to plant crops, raise animals, meet new villagers (even being able to marry them and have children) and exploring. It is very cheap compared to how good it is and i definetly recommend this to everyone. This game even made me want to be a farmer! So.. if you havent got it yet and looking through the reviews... BUY IT NOW!!!!!"
14631,"game is very nice, sadly ive become so attached to Shane i cant marry anyone else anymore.
(also there is alot of content and its easily modable if thats what u like :))"
14632,Mayonnaise the Pig approves

14638,sexy addictive
14639,amazing
14640,"This game is literally amazing. I was thinking about getting it since it came out, but never did until 2022. I should have gotten it sooner."
14641,"Top tier game , never seen a better life sim"
14642,Good Game
14643,"This is a game I come back to time and time again, and have been since 2018. It's a comfort game, at this point, and even though I've played it so much (not on this account), I'm still finding new things to enjoy about it. It's a great game!"
14644,"This game reminds me of everything I loved about playing Harvest Moon on my gamecube as a kid. Also love the LGBT marrying option!! It's a relaxing game with good character storylines. I haven't played for too long, but I can't wait to keep unlocking quests and building my little farm."
14645,soo fun :D
14646,it is boring
14647,FARM
14648,10\10 would play 100 hrs more.
14649,"The 35 hour on Steam is minuscule. I have a mere 310 hours in this game on the Switch (my brother probably has a thousand or more). Clearly, I love this game. It helps me with my depression and anxiety. It's comforting to play."
14650,"Endless layers to this game.  Most people say ""how relaxing,"" or whatnot, but really it requires a lot of patience, thought, and planning. ""How rewarding"" is more like it.

Great, balanced, awesome game all around."
14651,"Amazing, wholesome game"
14652,"Yes, I love this game because I can plant and farm lovely flowers and animals."
14653,Fun fun
14654,"Literally the cutest game on the planet, so many things to do! Different tasks/quests never leaving you bored! Building friendships and relationships with the characters, farming, mining, and other amazing secrets for players to find! This game can never leave anyone bored!"
14655,Surprisingly good RPG elements for a dating sim
14656,"its pretty fun
"
14657,"This game is fun, relaxing, and honestly not super complex. Crops have certain seasons they grow in, and certain lengths of time you need to be careful of, but other than that not a lot. The people are fun with a surprising amount of drama, and there's a pretty interesting plot. If the only reason you don't want to buy this is because you don't like farming simulators, see if a friend will share their steam library with you so you can give it a shot."
14658,i play this wayy too much. you should do the same!
14659,"this game is the best animal crossing experience without the animal crossing

14672,"Now you may be wondering: [i]'what business does someone like me who has a library full of war games and turn-based roleplaying games have with a farming simulator like Stardew Valley?'[/i] and I would tell you that it's because it's addictive for many reasons. The farming mechanics are simple yet potentially rewarding, the characters are endearing, and the goals which include marrying one of the characters and obtaining town developments for instance feel achievable should one possesses enough determination and patience.

Now I would admit that I may not have even touched Stardew were it just a farming sim without some combat. However, in an ironic twist of circumstance, I spend more of my time farming and foraging than partaking in any actually combat. In fact at the time of writing I'm level 8 in both farming and foraging but only level 1 in combat. The game is just that additive and has ignited a love for farming sims. I'm still very picky though.

The only nitpick I haswith Stardew is the damn fishing minigame. Expecting the player to [spoiler] be capable of immediately shifting the speed at which they click the mouse button just to keep the fish within the green box[/spoiler] without tiring themselves is expecting too much. Maybe that's the whole point of the game, to raise in-game fishing level in order to make it easier, but it has often resulted in no small amount of frustration for me. 

Other than the above complaint, Stardew Valley is one of the best games I've ever played and I would recommend it to anyone interested.

"
14673,"Well I love it. I'm usually a single player kind of person which I am loving btw but for one of the rare times in my own gaming history I also really love the multi player aspect as it's fun both with friends and alone, kind of a cliche review but hey I really think it's great, gives me something to do at least."
14674,"I love this game. I find it extremely relaxing, it is a comfort game I come back to every couple of months, similar to how some people are with Minecraft. The ability to farm is calming, I love taking care of my plants and animals! I also love being able to decorate, and Stardew allows you to decorate and be creative, with certain limitations of course (some bushes are not able to be cut down, there are some places you can't place furniture down). 

There are small complaints I do have about the game. I believe time moves a little too fast for how slowly you move around, but this could possibly be due to my ADD and the inattentiveness I have to slowly moving around, lol. I do also wish that there was a less-than-predictable formula with the NPCs. While I have my loves/likes/dislikes about each character, they do get a little boring after reading the dialogue all the time. Both of these problems, however, have been fixed by modding. 

I am terrible at fishing. 

Overall, 9.5/10."
14675,"Have I never left a review of this game before? I'm too lazy to check and see if I have in the past. But I just wanted to say, possibly once again, that this is the best game that was ever created. And all by one human being?! It deserves all the praise it has gotten, and then some. Stardew Forever. It's kinda life-changing."
14676,FUN!
14677,"good game, would smash robin"
14678,this is like my fourth time having to buy this game because of moving(long story) but its totally worth it this is possibly one of the best games ever made

14712,i love himbos
14713,Amazing Game!
14714,i love stardew valley
14715,"Stardew Valley is one of the best farming RPGs and every run-through I find more things I've never seen before, it's very open-ended so you can go at your own pace. The wiki is very helpful if you get stuck on something 😊

I recommend modding your game if you get bored of the base game, the modding community is absolutely amazing!"
14716,good game
14717,"i would highly recommend this game, if you like sandbox then i think you should try this game and if for some reason like farming then it would be a awesome game for you. You can also have character relationships even being able to have npc's as your boyfriend or girlfriend and then if you want you can even marry and have kids. Other things you can do are farming if your reading this then you should already know that but also you can mine look around the map for things on the ground and re-build the comunity center. Overall i think you should give this game a try 10/10"
14718,Visually exhausting from boredom
14719," I am a beginner in this game, but it is very cozy, uplifting, and I've grown attatched/addicted to playing :)"

14726,im loosing my virginity
14727,Great escape
14728,"Everyone should play this game. If you liked Harvest Moon, My Time at Portia, etc, you'll like Stardew Valley! Plus, ConcernedApe is creating a Haunted Chocolatier game so this is a great warm-up for what to expect in terms of world-building, soundtrack, character backstories..... I have loved all 300 hours I've put into this game, and that does not include the time I've played a modded version which can make it even more entertaining. Be prepared to spend hours farming crops, caring for animals, exploring the mines, and befriending the local townspeople. You get to marry someone in-game, if you'd like, and I always marry Sebastian - but there are lots of sweet souls in town (though also a few I was not a fan of). It's a great RPG, and a cozy, light-hearted game. 10/10."
14729,"it's such a slay.
i love mining and fishing and trading and giving diamonds to alex and farming and giving diamonds to alex and slaying creatures and picking up seashells and giving diamonds to alex!"
14730,"It's a great game. Creative, Fun, and extra fun because you can play with friends. I already have 27 hours on this game I'm pretty sure I've only had it for 4 days. It's definitely worth it."
14731,"One of the most relaxing games every.
I highly recommend you give it a try and lose yourself in the diverse and wholesome world of Pelican Town.
You get all with this game, cute farm animals, farming (even strategic if you like), mining and fishing which is very important because every good game has fishing. :)
You can advance in your own pace, chilling or going for maximum profits. You explore the town and meet unique citizens which all have different background stories.
Highly recommend, it is very satisfying!"
14732,"finally actually played this game and its as good as everyone says :)
"
14733,"I know more about the characters in game, than the people in my life. 10/10"

14755,"Stardew Valley is an EXPERIENCE. It combines farming, social interactions, combat, and relaxation all into one game. You grow quickly close to the NPC's in this game. You can form relationships and invest in each and every character. The farming is satisfying and the ability to build your farm as you'd like is a plus. There is combat that is very similar to Legend of Zelda though not as complex. You can gather, fish, mine, farm, etc. Stardew Valley is such a relaxing game that will pull you in. Every aspect of this game is enjoyable."
14756,the game is good.

The aim of the game is not just farming: it's a great game where you can fish, dig and fight.
Many characters can be interacted with.
Plenty of decorations can be made.
Horse, slime, chicken, duck, rabbit, cow, sheep, goat, pig and ostrich can be raised on the farm."

14849,"This is a very Addicting game to say the least. It involves all the key concepts a Good RPG needs: Farming, Foraging, Mining, Fishing. All into one game. its easy to understand, which for me at least, is a must have for any game i play. Not to Mention the Feature where you can talk and make friends with NPCS in the game. Many would think that if a game was good alone, its multiplayer Feature would be Trash. But This Games Multiplayer is honestly better than single player, if you are playing with the right person, that is. It can get a little tedious at times, but i find that with some good music playing and a drink next too me, its easily manageable."
14850,"Its alright, not entirely convinced its in a valley.
"
14851,"it good good

14852,Can't wait for the creator to come out with the new game Chocolatier. If stardew valley is any indication of how great of a game it will be I'm more then excited.
14853,good
14854,This game is really addicting! The story line is very well built and funny when it can (e.g Lewis and Marnie). I've done so much farming but the community center still brings me right back in. I can't say I've ever played a game this fun!
14855,more than a farming game

This is one of the best games that i have ever played and continue to enjoy it after two years. this game has thousands of hours of entertainment and I have only scratched the surface of this game. Even people who dont like this game should be able to enjoy the hard work and effort that went into producing this masterpiece of a game. I highly suggest getting this game if you like a relaxing time with friends, a story that can trap you in and a game that you can lose track of time while playing. This game is amazing and it is a mistake to not have it."

14911,"its a game yep
"
14912,"Absolute. Masterpiece.
Stardew Valley revolutionises the farming simulator concept, taking the genre to make it enjoyable without constant repetition. The game contains hours of content and aspects to explore (fishing/mining/farming), and won't leave you bored after completing the main story. I've owned this game on mobile, prior to purchasing it on Steam and I have elapsed around 100 hours there. Although, at times Stardew's progression can be slow, tedious and annoying to come by. All of the many features (and mods) available make the experience always feel fresh. In addition, the developer has worked so much and hard to bring the game to where it is today. With constant free updates and dedication to community, this makes Stardew Valley what it is today.
A Unique Masterpiece in Video Gaming."

14937,"Very nice and relaxing! If you're just starting, you'll have to reference the wiki quite a bit to know what to do since the game doesn't really tell you much, but once you get the hang of it, it's wonderful!"
14938,Love stardew valley. Endless content <3
14939,"I absolutely adore this game. On the outside it seems like a simple farming simulator, but it is so much more than just that. This game has everything from cave dungeons/monsters, ghosts/supernatural aspects, magic, deep stories and character developments, and soo much more. This is a game I've played for hours and I really recommend it."
14940,"I bought this game years ago, but it still gives me hours of relaxation and entertainment to this day. 10/10 would harvest parsnips again"
14941,fab
14942,it slaps
14943,Classic!
14944,"I love this game a lot more than I thought i would, highly recommend for anyone who doesnt mind a slow paced RPG with a few timed tasks thrown in that make you stress out a bit. To anyone whos considering, I would like to point out that its MORE than just farming, you fish and forage and mine as well. There are bad guys in the mines, and they get harder as you progress. 

*side note for new players:* there is a stardew wiki, and i recommend it HIGHLY, especially when youre trying to gather items for the community center bundles."
14945,gud
14946,"Honestly the best game i have bought on steam, 10/10"

14999,Jodi kinda bad *_*
15000,"Good game, great game in fact. Give these people your money in exchange for happiness."
15001,this game is good and even more fun when you're playing it with friends
15002,Fun game. Love playing co-op
15003,this game is everything to me
15004,Best game ever. Nothing more needs to be said.
15005,good
15006,I absolutely love this game so much and you should definitely get it.
15007,A great farming game where if you are looking for some chill time to sit back and relax this is a great game with tons to do. I played with some mods to make some QOL things better and to make the game more fun but that's for me personally. I do not know anyone who has ever played this game and didn't enjoy there time.
15008,great game! I would definetly reccomend ffor people who love nature
15009,"My soul gets drained the more I play, but the more I play the better my farm is..... Who needs a soul anyways"
15010,Good
15011,one of the grates
15012,good
15013,balla
15014,Perfect game to lose myself in.
15015,the game keeps getting updates and it's overall just very enjoyable
15016,I really enjoyed playing Harvest Moon on N64 growing up. This game is the closest I've found to that apart from Farmville on my phone. It's super addicting and satisfying to play!
15017,Lots of FUN!
15018,"Worth the small price

This costed me a fraction of a price against other games ive bought and has easily given me more enjoyment
Its more than just a farm sim, various mechanics and a design that gets you hooked
My complaints with it are mostly nit picky, very often had the problem of needing an item that was from another season, and while yes the travelling merchant exists, theres so many items that you will likely never see that item there, and when these items are required for story developement you are basically stuck. theres also the very limited interaction with the npcs, once a day and they get repetitive quickly
apart from that its a great game, glad indie devs are picking up where the triple-a devs basically dropped on the floor"
15019,super cool
15020,a great game
15021,Would sell 1700 jam again
15022,Love everything
15023,"The game is varied enough for daily play, interesting story lines, so many choices of interactions with NPC."
15024,"Good game
"
15025,"i spend 67 goddamn hours in this game just to get rejected by a blonde woman who says ""ew no"" real life sim 10/10"
15026,very nice game
15027,Very addictive love this game would recommend
15028,this game is fun i think
15029,"I have had this game for a while now but only played hours on end in the past two weeks because I've had more time. This game is ruining my life and destroying my ability to make in-person connections because I am so emotionally attached to these NPC's. I am so emotionally invested in this game and now all I think about is Stardew Valley. If I could give this game a rating out of five stars I would give it six stars. If there were 10,000 Stardew Valley players I'd be the most devoted one. If there were one Stardew Valley player it would be me. If there were zero Stardew Valley players I would be dead. This game is probably one of the last threads keeping me alive. I'm only at 32 hours so far and summer has just started."
15030,Kinda fun I guess.
15031,"This game has been a joy to keep coming back to.I won't repeat what everyone says because this game is a masterpiece. However, I have some advice if you are the type of person who has a hard time 100%ing a game or even completing the main quest. Consider finding a close friend or partner to play with. 

I normally don't finish anything. But my lovely girlfriend is a HUGE fan of the game. She's obsessed. It's a joy to see her happiness and spend time with her. Particularly in this relaxing little game. There's a surprising amount of depth to it that I would not experience without her.

10/10."
15032,tricks my depression into feeling like im productive
15033,Stardew Valley is a wonderfully relaxing farming sim game with beautiful style. The gameplay is varied enough that you can always find something interesting to do and playing with friends adds a whole new dimension. This is a great game to turn on and spend a rainy day indoors falling in love with.
15034,Fun to play with friends
15035,It good game
15036,"Almost 1000 hours spent playing this game and I still play it! If that doesn't say I love it, I don't know what does! <3<3<3"

15041,love this game
15042,help i cant stop playing
15043,"Great farming sim game, plenty to do"
15044,"I use mods on this game and it has taken the game from great to amazing. I love the little details, and how you get to learn what works best for your farm, as well as getting to build relationships with all of the characters. I definitely suggest this mod. There is a butt-load of content here considering that it is only $15."
15045,I love this gay game
15046,"Dear Stardew Enjoyers,

Unfortunately, I CANNOT recommend such a game. My disappointing and lacking experience fell short of what I expected, as well as left me wondering what incel could possible enjoy such a game. This dating simulator simply is too slow and materialistic as the women KEEP TAKING MY HARD EARNED THINGS. Hunting down your woman of choice and gifting them flowers and nonsense everyday for WEEKS at times seems to realistic for the one and done man I am. When I want to marry my virtual sweetheart, I don't want to have to go through the realistic and grueling process of earning both their trust and respect. I want to be able to take advantage of the advanced coding and technological skills that we have spent thousands of years to acquire, to enjoy a proper experience that I payed for. To waste that on such mindless tasks such as farming and finishing is primitive. My only hope to play this game past the 7.8 hours I have on record, is to play Stardew Valley Love DLC which I pitch as an alternative and more enjoyable Stardew experience. I think that I speak for all mega-chads when writing this review, and I heavily recommend that Concerned""Ape"" (I mean it's in the name) takes this opportunity to turn a new leaf and give the paying gamers the experience that they deserve.

Sincerely,
Zerango (A Mega-Chad Gaming Boss)"
15047,"This game is a laid back, interesting farming sim with cute graphics and adorable music."

15056,this is the only game that would let me live my dream of being happy.
15057,better than animal crossing
15058,Mods make gameplay more fun and should be easier to update & integrate!

15075,it be nice
15076,Very Fun to play if you have nothing to do
15077,Very fun game! I got it in steam because I enjoyed it so much on the switch and I wanted to play with my friends! So I have actually bought this game twice.
15078,fun

15101,farmville is a terrible game
15102,very
15103,"I hummed and hawed over getting this game because someone (an ex) told me it was a waste of money. Over a year later I purchased it through steam and on my Switch, and this game is literally the perfect game for anyone to try out. It's what my bf and I use to spend quality time together, as LDR don't give you many things to do together. I also play a solo game on my switch. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a new casual game or something cute to do with a significant other, or even with friends"
15104,blueberrie !
15105,Stardew Valley
15106,"I love this game!! If you are looking for a well made, aesthetic, and chill game then you NEED to buy Stardew Valley."
15107,<3
15108,you need to play this game with your friends or else it is no fun
15109,"just reached perfection in winter year 4, best singleplayer game i've ever played"
15110,!!!
15111,"Love this game! so fun and cute if you enjoy the gathering, farming, resource building etc. Also has combat if you like that, and relationships with townsfolk."
15112,Kool game
15113,"I love this game soooo much. The NPCs and the storyline are amazing to uncover, everyone is so unique and complex. I love the hard work you put into being a farmer and seeing the returns of that hard work compound daily. There's a lot to explore, it's a great mix of sandbox, RPG, and adventure. You never know what you're gonna get and the storylines available for your character are plentiful. Great creative community of players as well so it's a really good game for mods whether for aesthetic, utility, or gameplay. This is especially when you've finished the game and want to expand it. Essentially, the game never ends. Super recommend. I haven't loved a game this much in a long time!"
15114,"fun especially with friends, pretty setting"
15115,Willy >
15116,Good game would be better if I could eat rocks
15117,"It definitely has a learning curve- it's not the type of game where you can jump in and just figure everything out on your own. I'd watch some videos on things you should know, and look at the Stardew Valley Wiki if you're unsure of anything as you're playing. Once you get over the initial ""new game"" bumpiness, it's fun, and you can play for hours without getting bored. The art is beautiful as well."
15118,yes buy
15119,"A really relaxing, fun game, with mods replay value is infinite."
15120,This little farming simulator is ridiculously addictive and actually just a whole bunch of fun. 10/10 recommend it.

I originally played this game and expected not to enjoy it but I literally couldn't put it down, I'm now 500 hours deep on the PC version and own it on as many different devices as I can. I recommend this game to the moon and back, best purchase you'll ever make from Steam."

15132,"I have been playing for years and I promise I will never stop. This game brings me joy and peace, talking with villager and making room for new crops. I constantly recommend this game to my friends and recently got my boyfriend into it. Couldn't have more fun playing a game, it genuinely has it all."

15150,Be gay do crime!
15151,"When you start playing, it starts out simple enough. Planting crops, tending them, harvesting them. But it's more than that. There's other skills to work on, there's quests, relationships with the villagers, and so much LORE! This game really sucks you in on a simple premise, and then you discover how complex the characters are and how many things you have to do. Even in the end game, I'm keeping myself entertained with decorating every area I can access. Then I'll be starting over with a new farm on a different map. 

And if you're REALLY into it, then there's mods that expand the game even more. 

This game is perfect if you're looking for an escape, by yourself or with friends."
15152,everything about this game is perfect.
15153,"Great game, Easily spend hours on this addictive farming/mining simulator, The amazing soundtrack almost lulls me to sleep"
15154,yes
15155,"One of the best games of all time. The levels of depth and charm are astounding. If someone turned ""cozy"" into a game, this would be the result."
15156,best game to exist
15157,"This game had a vice grip on my life for so long that I bought around 8 copies just so I could get other people to play with me. The modding community is so rich that I can constantly change what I'm playing to be something completely different, and it's awesome."
15158,ADICTIVO

15166,"hello, i played this game for 1.9 hours, and that is 1.9 hours i'll never get back. I didnt even buy this game, i gameshared it from my friend and I said please take me off ur gamesharing this game was so horrible it made me actually vomit. I legit bought my 3080 and this was the first game I played because all my friends were telling me to hop on and I was like ok :D but little did I know this would be the worst day of my life. I refunded my 3080 because I did not want to play any more games after that. i went back to college and start pursuing my PhD, finally am graduating this year all thanks to stardew valley. great game!"

15184,I personally don't like casual games like this but I can see the charm.
15185,"This is a really fun farming game for when you have hours to spend doing nothing. Complete, concentrated dopamine. Only thing I hated about this game is how big the learning curve is, it takes a very long time to figure things out"

15195,"Just play it. it gud. btw go the jojamart route
"
15196,I hate jodi. She doesn't need to be in the game.
15197,SO GOOD ALREADY HAVE 110 HOURS
15198,"This game has it's issues, namely the lack of diversity and colonialist story-lines, ableism, classism, sexism, and the fact that your character is at least in their mid to late twenties and has the options to date NPCs that are almost certainly teenagers. This is most certainly due to the fact that it was coded single-handedly by a white guy who doesn't believe in hiring sensitivity readers. Just putting that out there for folks to use to make more informed choices. I mod the h**k out of this game and enjoy it quite a bit. I did receive it as a gift, though. The mechanics and gameplay are very addictive, and mods add some diversity, expanded character arcs, and many many quality of life improvements. There are quite a few games in this style now so there's much more choice and many of them handle ""the issues"" much better."
15199,yasss

15209,very fun game played so much on my switch and decided to buy on steam dont regret at all
15210,parsnips.
15211,GF forces me to play
15212,now i can have a wife and my own farm at least in the game. thanks for the opportunity to touch the grass.
15213,"very nice, would spend thousands of dollars on microtransactions"
15214,I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game to relax and play with no pressure whatsoever. Cozy game with many things to do for few hundreds of hours of content. 10/10 for my taste honestly.
15215,Awesome!
15216,Let me live on a farm in Stardew Valley I'm begging you
15217,its good
15218,g o o d   g a m e

15220,good
15221,"Do you like Harvest Moon or any of those other farming dating sims? Then here's another. Except clearly more adult oriented. No cutesy romances and light-hearted all the time aura. Nah, we go deep in this game. Want to date an alcoholic? There's one for you. Maybe you feel like a girl who just likes to do her art in a cabin in the woods. Better yet, why not date them all? Cause in this game, you can. And if you feel like you chose the wrong one? Why start all over when you can divorce them. 

And I guess the animals are cute. You an get a black chicken after awhile. Also, hint. If you have a river or farm on your land, put the coop beside it and fence it in. You won't regret it. 

And if you're like me and get into 200 hours, still love the game but want a little more, then Mods. There is a mod that expands the game and ads more characters, cut-scenes, and areas to explore. 

Sooooooo 100/10 would recommend."
15222,Stardew Valley
15223,very nice

15230,"Literally addicting like ong. I love it sm, its one of my safe games. I love to play it with my friends, as well as alone! Its just something that puts you in a good mood when you play it"
15231,"A relaxing experience that teaches the player to slow down. The days are short, but life is long. You always have next year.

When I started playing this game, I was frantically running around each day giving things to the people of Pelican Town. I wanted them to like me as fast as possible, but I quickly realized I wasn't getting anything done on my farm. By the end of Summer, I finally kicked my farm into gear, and now I have a beautiful farm with chickens and a cow before winter. I enjoy the little things, and I'm not bothered by time limits imposed by quests. My motto is now ""just take it slow"". I'll be able to do anything I missed next year :). Use the Stardew Valley wiki if you want, but the best experience is one where not everything is known.
The only tips I'd give is there are universally loved, liked, neutral, disliked, and hated items. Most cooked food is liked. Aside from that, everything else is discovery!"
15232,It is very fun
15233,"An all-time favourite. I`ve come back to it a few times, which says a lot. There aren`t many games that can hold my interest as long as this one has."
15234,"Play it, trust me. It's a fun, cute game. Be careful, you might get addicted"
15235,love it
15236,"grind-y, cute, relaxing heaven. love the soundtrack, graphics are adorable, and the perfect mix of story-driven quests and room to brain-off grind materials!"

15245,​
15246,"This Game Is So CUTE!!

I highly recommended this game. Its cute fun and relaxing for players. 
"
15247,I like this. It's involved but also has a chill vibe. Makes a good life replacement at times.
15248,"This is probably one of the most relaxing experiences you can possibly have in a game. I have a lot of social anxiety and after a long day at work, I'll sit down and play this. I haven't played much of the PC version but across all the platforms I have played it on I have gathered about 200 (maybe more) hours in this game. Now before you say ""go outside"" I just want you to know that it's definitely partially due to lockdowns and all that. If you're ever feeling a bit down or something along those lines. This is the game you want to play to cheer yourself up. The wholesome storyline and characters make it such a heartwarming experience. For those on edge about this game, I absolutely recommend it to anyone who has high-stress levels or wants a calming game other than Minecraft to play. 11/10"
15249,"is very fun
:)"
15250,delightful
15251,Very fun relaxing game that you can enjoy by yourself.

15272,"its a really chill game but also has some kind of adventure that keeps the game from being only a farm simulator. When I had this game for two days I had already 28 hours in it

15294,"A true masterpiece, built with love."
15295,:)
15296,"If you haven't played or seen this game before then I really think you should try it, it's truly excellent and very wholesome.

[h1] Playtime and Time/money [/h1]
At the time of writing this I've put in about 60 hours and the game is 15$, that's 25 cents per hour of enjoyment. If you compare that to 15 1$ tacos you'll quickly see that this is well worth your time and will give you more enjoyment. plus you can come back to it and get more and more out of it. The game can be modded, and plenty of people are more addicted to this game format than I.

[h1] Exactly what is this game? [/h1]
This is a farming simulator RPG with romance and combat, with a heavier emphasis on the role playing part of the game. Its very enjoyable to get into, and it can be played with your friends to make it even more interesting. The only person worthy of my love is krobus, be sure to give them a pumpkin from me. <3

[h1]So now the standard game rating:[/h1][list]
[*][b]Story: yes/10[/b] Role playing game, make your own story out of what you're given.
[*][b]Gameplay: 7/10 [/b] It's a solid loop.
[*][b]Presentation: 9/10[/b] great artstyle and aesthetic.
[*][b]Soundtrack: 7/10[/b] It's good, but it annoys me over time.
[*][b]Replayability: 10/10[/b] Great to come back to, playable offline, playable with friends, and modable."
15297,lovely game
15298,The best game
15299,"Very fun game, bit hard to understand on first playthrough but still a great game to sink some hours into with some friends."
15300,"Legit, one of the best games to play when you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed. It's such a relaxing game to play when you just want to chill. It's a lovely game and I can't recommend it enough. One of my top 10 games of all time for sure. (I have over 300 hours on my switch as of the time of writing)"
15301,"maybe if i plant enough crops, they'll finally love me"
15302,"For me, its a very nice and casual game, something to ease the mind after a long day, and the pixelated style is pleasant on the eyes, colours can be a bit bright, but i think that adds to the charm of the game. :)"
15303,"if this game had me staying up late because of how relaxed i felt while playing it, then you should definitely play it too"
15304,little farmers
15305,Its really fun and it's been a week and I've already played for 95+ hours. Mostly on the PC edition but also on the mobile and switch editions

15312,I love this game!
15313,farm game good
15314,"If you like to chill out (I mean really chilling out) while playing games, this game is for you. You just plant crops and take care of your animals, and when you feeling like it, decorate your farm."

15326,game fun !

15328,"12 of my 149 hours in this game have been from the past 2 days alone, after I discovered the modding for this game. The prior 137 hours were all vanilla/base game with absolutely nothing, but hard work and multiple saves to get better achievements. AND I STILL HAVE SO. MUCH. TO DO. 

It's ridiculously fun. Even more fun when playing with friends or family. Especially if you're in a relationship. He goes mining, I go fishing. It's the trade off. 

Get this game."

15357,game is good
15358,GOOD
15359,yes
15360,"Honestly, it's incredible that this masterpiece of a game is only $15, truly incredible.
This game gives you everything you could possibly want in life, a stable job, minimal stress, a loving partner, and plenty of work where deadlines are optional, so you rarely have to worry about getting things done. of course, if you take villager requests, those have deadlines but they're never super difficult and completely optional.
The music is great, the atmosphere is great, visuals are great, NPCs are great, etc.
It's always so much fun to play, since there's always work to be done, always a goal to work towards, yet it never feels overwhelming, it never puts any sort of pressure on you to get things done, it's all done on your own time at your own pace.

Really the only issue I have is that the dialogue can get old, and it's not super difficult to wear out every dialogue option a villager can have. However, that's a minor issue and one that just about every game is going to have, so I don't really mind.
Also, this game can really take over your life if you allow it to. I can barely go ten minutes without thinking about things I could do and what I need to do. Even if there's no real deadline, you may start thinking about the game constantly and what you could or should be doing.
However, as long as you can push past an incoming obsession, you'll be ok. I hope. The obsession quickly overpowered me, so I have no idea if it's possible but hey that's just me, I'm sure you'll be fine. :)

Overall, this game is absolutely amazing, and if you have time to spare, you should absolutely play."
15361,"Disappointment: The Simulator. Oh you got a chest? Yeah, there's coal in it. Oh you got another chest? Yeah, nothing in it at all. Did you plan ahead going into that mine and bring extra food for extra energy? Too bad, we put a time limit on your day, it takes a full hour and a half to get home, and you'll pass out on the way and have to pay. Oh, you want to earn enough money to buy a single upgrade to a single one of your weapons? Be ready to spend the next six hours standing at a pier fishing because everything you need to buy is expensive, everything you sell is cheap, and hell I'm already in summer and don't have enough money for a sprinkler."
15362,SOOO GOOD
15363,fun :)
15364,Worth getting just for the fishing mini-game.
15365,"Farming, aliens, fishing mini-game, romance, mining mini-game, evil corporation trying to take everyone out... what's not to love? There's always something going on and you can choose to worry about it or choose to go about your day and farm to your life's content."
15366,pretty good game

If you want to play ""tedious clicking' or ""walk back and forth a lot"" then this is the game for you."
15371,cool game
15372,good game.
15373,It should be illegal to be this good at making games.
15374,"I've been playing on a different Steam account for years and have over a thousand hours combined from both accounts. I play both vanilla and with mods, it's really fun and there's so much to do early game and late game. Some things are tedious like Mr Qi's quests and Junimo cart, but it's really amazing and I recommend it to everyone"

15385,"Stardew Valley is a rare game. Not only is it outstanding it sets a new standard for the genres it occupies that will be seen in the games that follow it. While i have my gripes with the game it is also my most played in my library, which is quite a feat as I am often rather impatient and struggle to dedicate much time into anything. 

If you have not played this game I recommend it with all my heart and my only advice is to play in what ever way you want, whether you min max and beat most of the game before year 3 or don't marry someone until year 5 just figure out what you enjoy and just play. Once you are tired there is a whole modding scene that adds even more content and quality of life options that can massively change the game for you."
15386,"it relaxing. it radical. it beautiful. what else can i say

Ok fr though, this game is beautiful. It takes what harvest moon did and made it 100,000x better than it's original source. check it out"
15387,I think this game is so much fun and sooooo relaxing. Sometimes it can be stressful but I absolutely love it. I have been playing for a couple years now and I literally can't get enough.
15388,hot ladies
15389,good fun and relaxing
15390,Stardew Valley has an amazing set up with tons of content to explore and has been the most pleasant game experiences I've had by far.
15391,Simple yet such a sophisticated game. It is very relaxing since you get to decide what tasks you'd like to complete. Would highly recommend :))))
15392,"I am absolutely in love with this game, I love taking care of animals and growing crops. There is so many different scenarios and cut scenes. An overall good game!"
15393,"game good, monkey happy"
15394,Funny farmin
15395,Nothing like doing manual labor from the tips of your fingers.
15396,"Happy and mellow game, build a peaceful little farm without worries."
15397,"So fun, the best part is to make friends with the town people."
15398,"I'm a huge fan of those calm type games, like animal crossing or tomodachi life, but I could never get into a farming sim. This game though, it's completely changed my perspective, I absolutely love this game, it has amazing characters, a charming visual style, and a surprising variety of gameplay! and this game can also be amazing with friends if you all have the right intentions in mind"
15399," Stardew Valley is an amazing game that's simple, yet has challenging tasks. When playing, you can find time flies and your mood gets better. Absolutely reccomened."

15413,I LOVE STARDEW VALLEY
15414,"A game I keep coming back to, years later, or a nice relaxing retreat"
15415,"Overall a pretty solid game which becomes more complex with the player's engagement. I like how there are always numerous activities for the player to do such as farming, fishing, domestication, etc, with constraints the player need to keep in mind. I do dislike the times where you have to depend on the Stardew Wiki as opposed to finding the info in game. Otherwise I would recommend this to anyone in search of a more laid back but fun game."
15416,"This is one of the best games I have ever played! It's calm and relaxing, but also competitive and fun! Would totally recommend and worth the money! :D"

15446,"Steam tells me I have played Stardew Valley for 7556 hours. That' not totally accurate as I leave the game running on pause all the time and play in short bursts, but since the game has launched I have pretty much had a game going at all times. It's chill when I need to relax, but when I need a challenge or something interesting to do it's always there. I have 65 mods running. It's a classic now, you'll either love the world or find it frustrating and too slow paced. I probably will never find a game I love as much!"

15457,hell yea
15458,"I've always been a huge animal crossing fan, and of all sorts of that stuff for that matter. My friends have always told me to check this game out. Naturally, I LOVE it. wholesome, funny, relaxing, and even a bit of a thrill at times. and the co-op? highly recommend."
15459,"Very nice game
"
15460,Get this game
15461,Fun Game~
15462,Y E S
15463,awesome
15464,"Love this game. The developer/s put so much love and depth into a simple ""farming"" game. You technically don't even need to farm. You can chat up everybody you want, even some entities you might not expect to make friends with, marry most young-adults in the town, explore Stardew Valley and many other places. The only bad point about this game is that it can be quite tedious to grind for all the money and resources for upgrading farm-houses. 
Overall an insanely peaceful, interesting game that promises less than it actually gives us. Over time, the addition of so many new resources, places and dialouge can be overwhelming, but it plays perfectly into the more laid-back ""take your time"" attitude the game presents.
Definitely a 9.5/10"
15465,"I've bought this game 4 times in (once in steam, once in android, and twice in Switch - digital and physical). That says how much I really enjoy this game. I used to play this game way back in college and harbored over 300 hours on it. Now that I am older, more cynical, jaded and have worked a corporate job where sometimes it feels like your soul gets crushed, it's nice to come back to this game to be reminded of nice things in life. ConcernedApe really didi a great job in developing and maintaining this game. It is no exaggeration to say how much this game cleanses my mental state. Thanks, Eric."
15466,relaxing
15467,very good
15468,Shits a therapy
15469,better than squad. squad sucks dude.
15470,"yes, just yes"
15471,Playing solo :'(
15472,love
15473,It's the cutest farming builder you ever did play. Don't play it with your friend if you're hyper. It's too chill for that.
15474,"farm, water, take crop and than repeat till everything feels numb 10/10"
15475,"There isn't much to dislike about this game. One of the only complaints is fishing in the beginning is very difficult and depending on each person it might or might not get better. Other than that everything else is beautiful from the soundtrack to the sprites/sprite portraits, and the game-play."
15476,"Love this, if you love slime rancher you will also love this"
15477,"This is a very calming, well known game! I definitely suggest it!"
15478,Best game I ever played 10/10!
15479,Bom jogo.
15480,Donno how to review this game. It made me waste some real life days until I snapped out of it. Good game
15481,"It's a good, cute, and wholesome game :)"
15482,Game
15483,this game is what so many others are trying to copy it's so perfect. It's relaxing and fun to progress. 10/10
15484,It's good.
15485,luv luv luv
15486,
15487,very cute and i like the chickens
15488,"While I've only played the pc version for 4 hours I have put over 100 hours into the switch version of the game. I absolutely love both of them! The calm atmosphere and easy going nature of the game leads it to be a good way for me to sit back and relax for a few hours. While I do wish there was a bit more instruction for a few things, I'm glad the game doesn't hold my hand or expect me to follow through with things in order to proceed. Stardew Valley is definitely a game for people who just wanna relax and farm (and fish, mine, etc). But keep that wiki tab open because how else are you gunna find out what Elliot's loved gifts are for his birthday?"
15489,Great relaxing game for when you just want to wind down after a long day. It also has lots to do so you wont run out of things to do for a long time.
15490,buy my cereal
15491,"i could not handle playing this game
the in game time system caused me anxiety

i feel like i would blink and another day would pass
Stardew Valley causes existential nightmares
the time system moving fast mirrored how fast time moves for me in the real world and i was unable to handle the overwhelming terror of looming doom"
15492,I like this game
15493,how do i get achievements
15494,"This is just a real chill time. 
the fact that it isnt telling you explicitly what to do is nice, and you never feel bored cause you always have to take care of animals or get more rocks.
its just nice."
15495,:)
15496,Game smacks
15497,this game allowed me to release my creativity! Loved it very much
15498,"Fun, relaxing game"
15499,gaming.
15500,"This game is one of my favorites. I can focus on this and not have any opposing thoughts while I play this. This helps me with my anxiety and depression, and I enjoy how it will hold your hand at times and leave you in the dark. Concerned Ape made a great game. I thank him dearly for this game."
15501,it god
15502,I don't like 2D pixel games; but I absolutely adore stardew :) its super cute and relaxing with all sorts of different things to explore and specialize in.
15503,"I could not rate this game higher if I tried. I have it on three different platforms, and have been playing for YEARS. And yet, I'm still not tired of it. It also helps that it is mod compatible, adding new layers of fun.

Before playing this game, legend of zelda: ocarina of time was my most loved game of all time. But this sweet, simple, mystical farming game made by CancernedApe took that spot. 10/10"
15504,sheep
15505,Bad PC port.  You cannot change the buttons on gamepad/controller.
15506,"I find stardew valley is a unique, relaxing and fun game. This game(though i have a lot to discover) has given me so many fun and interactive things to do and i cant wait to get further through. Over all i would say stardew valley is a great game though if you go into and expect to get souly great game play due to it being praised by most of the people who own it, your not gonna get the full experience and enjoy it to the fullest, due to a lot of the effort in the game being put towards the npc's."
15507,absolute favorite
15508,good game
15509,"I've played this game on and off (solo and multiplayer) for many many years now and it has genuinely given me some nice relaxing times. Recently, I added in some basic mods to the game without altering the main game play or general feel of it. Definitely do recommend ones like DCBurgers High Resolution Profiles and another one on Nexus that allows you to see where each character is on the map without having to google their locations to help making romancing easier ;)  Highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys casual games, minecraft, or simple farming sims with romance options"
15510,Much better than Animal crossing and gives me an actual reason to keep playing and talk to the NPCs
15511,One of my all time favorite games.
15512,3
15513,shit
15514,life
15515,stardoo :)
15516,can't marry any of the milfs
15517,"fun, easy-going game; not stressful at all :)"
15518,I own 6 copies of this game.
15519,This game is incredibly addicting.
15520,good
15521,Addicting farming sim. Nothing crazy just an incredibly enjoyable game with a long lifespan. 8/10
15522,Amazing game if only it had open world with no limits
15523,"Stardew Valley was recommended to me by a few friends and so I thought about giving it a go. First impressions, the overall aesthetic and music is really pleasing and I could honestly play it for hours on end without having the urge to play something else. It reminds me a lot of Minecraft and Terraria combined, but what I found most unique about this game is the fact that it allows for more in depth NPC dialogue through the means of quests and events to better create different relationships with each character.

Despite feeling a little overwhelmed at first glance because I joined an already built-up world and struggled to find my way home a few nights in, I'd most definitely recommend this game to anyone else!"
15524,"awesome game filled with great characters and lots to do, perfect way to pass time."
15525,IVE PLAYED THIS GAME FOR 12 HOURS ALREADY??? WHAT THE FUCK???
15526,great game 10/10
15527,it's fire
15528,Stardew Valley is the best game ever!
15529,Highly reccomend modding to have double time each day but overall if you love harvest moon you'll love this
15530,Watch out. it's addictive..
15531,game got boring after like 5 minutes tbh

15537,is good you buy you like
15538,this game is cool as hell that's all
15539,Im still looking for the valley. Sneaky bastard
15540,honest work
15541,I didn't think I'd like farming simulator games. And yet here we are
15542,It's very fun and relaxing
15543,"Best chill game ever, especially with friends!"
15544,sucks hours but fun with friends
15545,Farm game good

15559,"Surprisingly complex, certainly surpassed all expectations and well worth the money! Great multiplayer experience as well."
15560,very good
15561,vvery fun but not for people that like fast paced games
15562,Better than fortnite
15563,Lewis is pretty hot
15564,Best Game Ever.
15565,"It was a nice gift from a dear friend, I only played like 2 years later sadly, I wish I had started earlier! It's so relaxing, beautiful pixel art. Only 9 hours in and I still have so much to discover... there is some mysteries going on, anyway, I recommend if you just want to relax after a long and tiring day!"
15566,"love it
"
15567,gud game
15568,good game...
15569,"I have over 400 hours on this game, and I still haven't beaten it/completed the perfection tracker. It never gets old and is incredibly wholesome. I love this game so much."
15570,super fun and calm
15571,You can farm
15572,   .
15573,is good
15574,"Probably my favourite game! Literally nearly endless amounts of things to do. Even after playing so much, I still love coming back to this game."
15575,"Stardew Valley is a game I like but forgot to review.

You play as you.
You are given the deed on a farm from your Gpappy after he died on a very uncomfortable looking bed that they apparently fixed but I refuse to accept that.  After deciding that working at Google/Wal-Mart/Amazon/insert company you don't like, you decided to take the deed and leap out on your own, creating a life near the town of Stardew Valley,  an ideal town filled with dirt bags that I like.

Stardew Valley is a farming sim made by one guy who really likes Harvest Moon. You go about your days farming, doing chores, talking to the townsfolk, and other activities in your quest to industrialize and become everything you hate. 

If you're somehow unfamiliar with the concept, Farming RPGs like Stardew Valley are laid back, relaxing games where you just sort of live out your life as a farmer, a concept started in the 90s with the Harvest Moon series. The genre has come a long way since then, and Stardew is considered one of the best in the genre by many. I think its pretty good as well, but you shouldn't listen to me, take nightmares as prophetic dreams. 

While the gameplay is solid as [b]just[/b] a farming game, you have a bunch of  activities to do so the game doesn't get boring. You can go fishing, dungeon delving, mining, courting HOT BABES, and scavenging on the side. Not to mention the mini-arc of restoring the town center so the big bad mega corp doesn't take it over.
Or sell it to them. If you're evil. Like me. 

The people of Stardew Valley are, well, they're flawed, but that's how their written. They're not supposed to be idealized or perfect human beings. Everyone has a nack or an a flaw that humanizing them, like the hobo that's roleplaying as me or the dude who literally came back from a war.
By the way, there's a war in the backstory. 

After reaching a certain affinity with people in the town, events will play out that move your relationship with said person forward. Sebastian has an inferiority complex, for instance. Or how Demetrius threatened me about his daughter Maru because she has a “bright future” and he didn't want to see her held back by me.

So I married her and put a baby in her.
How'd you like them apples, “dad?” 

Stardew Valley does have the problem every farming life RPG has where you eventually run out of interactions with the town folk. Which is understandable until true-AI becomes a thing and we use it to make video games more realistic before it nukes us/uses us as batteries. 

But the biggest draw of Stardew is the modding scenes which actually fill in a lot of gaps from game development. Things like more interactions and events, new portraits, quality of life improvements, to straight up new areas, including new towns and even NPCs.
That's nuts. 

Stardew Valley also has multiplayer. So you can drag your fellow hobos kicking and screaming to work on your [strike]plantation[/strike] farm.  This game does everything, huh?

Stardew Valley gets a 8 indentured serfs out of 10. 

The best place in the world to see rainbows is in Hawaii.

15576,"gud game, much fun"
15577,.
15578,Pretty poggers
15579,Sad? play cute farm game!
15580,Poggers game
15581,"It is good. I haven't played the new update but I know it's good. Well I mean I remember it being good. Hey also people who reply to this can they tell me what is that like Minecraft x Stardew Valley game is called I'm lazy to look it up

Kidding, I just want to type more to exercise my fingers since I just got out of a hospital bed."
15582,it slays and i love it
15583,"130 hours have been put into this game and I loved every second of it, obsessed would be a good word to use because it was mostly almost always on my mind and then I came to a stopping point in the game because I feel like there could be new additions to it to make the game longer or different quests to do but lets be honest I will still probably play this game because its just that good!! If your thinking about it, in the words of Nike, just do it!"
15584,farm game:)
15585,This game is so much fun! I love to play when I just need to relax and chill. I also love being able to have a co-op farm with a friend.
15586,Not my normal style of game but man I am addicted already
15587,good
15588,"Awesome game, Love it!!!!"
15589,"GOOD FARM YES
"
15590,Make me feel like i'm actually doing something productive
15591,"Such an amazing game with adorable animals, interactive npcs, and so much stuff you can do. Super wholesome, and you can do what you want at your own pace."
15592,ywa
15593,absolutely love this game. i've had it on the playstation 4 and the switch and havinv it here on the pc is even mor efun with all of the mods i can add.
15594,"good flirting material, worked for me"
15595,I own this game on three consoles and now the PC version. Hundreds and hundreds of hours playing this wonderful game. Highly recommend to players young or old.
15596,Good game with high replay ability. I have this game across multiple platforms and it can be highly addicting!! It feels like there is always something to do and you can have different experiences with either play through because there are different paths you can follow for the over-arching story.
15597,BWESAET GAME EVER
15598,emily.
15599,I like it.
15600,"I love this game, I've played about 570 hours so far and still enjoying myself. 
It's relaxing and immersive, but also engaging and at times slightly stressful (catching that Legend fish, trying to get through the skull caverns, etc). I can spend hours at a time playing it as it's quite addictive and draws you in, the immersiveness means you tend to lose track of real life time so be aware of this (if you start playing at 9pm it will suddenly be 3am before you know it!).
The characters in the town are well written, their storylines are interesting, emotional, fun. I've got 10 hearts with everyone because I wanted to see all their stories.
I love how customisable it is too, with decorating the farm house, placing items, arranging the farm, your characters outfit..
If you get frustrated with the fishing early on in the game, it does get easier as you progress and level up so stick with it."
15601,[b]spongegoob[/b]
15602,"I was a bit skeptical of this even though i'd seen all the great reviews. I think the game has so much too it, down to how you play and what you want to customise. It's easy to get lost in it for hours. I really do recommend, especially for those on mac, as we don't have many options!"
15603,best game
15604,its a really fun game
15605,When I first saw Sebastian.......................... it was like I had never felt anything before. Sebby is so perfectly curated for me. He is my sole reason for existing and I will only ever romance Sebby. He is my one true love ;-; sorry to my husband but he's not sebby.
15606,"Likes: Yes
Dislikes: Yes 
*thumbs up*"
15607,"My favourite abstract metric for how good this game is is simply the top games on Nexus mods, it's an unusual gem for that list of multi billion dollar hits but it fits so snugly;

15608,"Tasty game. I play this 14 hours at a time. Shane's cut-scenes make me Sad, but I like that in a man. 12/10 game. Lets me live out my Polish dream of having a farm and being gay."
15609,good game omg super nice
15610,I don't dislike anything about it. :)

15612,good game
15613,"wonderful joyfully relaxing time, still on my original early release save, love coming back and potting around"
15614,JESSE! I MADE THE BLUEBERRY WINE JESSE!
15615,anyone who plays this game is a certified cutie
15616,"nice
"
15617,i can fix them
15618,"Seeing as I now own this game on 3 platforms I think it's safe to say I absolutely love it.
- Gameplay has a nostalgic HM feel to it (as ConcernedApe intended when he created it I believe) and NPCs are written pretty well and fairly relatable. 
- There is no shortage of things to do at any given time and I can literally get lost in designing and building up my farm for several hours at a time. 
- The choice of multiple starting farms gives the game plenty of replayability and challenges you to set up different things or try different things for profit. 
- Multiplayer is everything above enjoyed with a friend! Or with 3 friends!

Overall a solid 10/10. Will be buying ConcernedApe's next game for sure."
15619,"chill

15620,zz
15621,"Stardew Valley is one of my favorite games I have ever played. I picked it up in search for a game that will help just relieve some stress and be a fun game to pick up here and now. Turns out it was that and much more. The past few weeks I can't wait to get home to play this game. Making a life, making relationships with nice townspeople, and experiencing different roles and jobs is amazing. Can't wait for Haunted Choclatier."
15622,"Like any review, my feelings on Stardew Valley are the result of my experience with it. Maybe you don’t thrive off random adventures like I do, or maybe you won’t feel the same sense of accomplishment I did when I completed my first house. If not, then you likely haven’t or won’t enjoy Stardew Valley in the same way. And that’s OK. Stardew, more than any other game I know, isn’t about playing it a specific way; it’s an open-world, a blank page just daring you to jump in and do with it what you will. The question, then, isn’t what you need to do to succeed, what’s needed to win, but what are you willing to do to make your dreams come to life?"
15623,Farm
15624,Fishing rules!
15625,"farm, buy stuff, repeat. 9/10"
15626,wake up water a million crops go to sleep repeat 10/10

15630,BEST GAME EVER
15631,Great game for solo and co-op play as a pass time
15632,dont forget the egg festival also fuck you abigail
15633,I love this and hope they keep updating it
15634,"i already have like 100+ hours on playstation, got it on steam for the SVE mod. 100% would recommend the mod and the game."
15635,yA
15636,i love everything about it.
15637,"this game has egirls.

10/10 recommend their onlyfans
"
15638,"Honestly, a very beautiful game, I have played it over and over again, I can't get enough of it!"
15639,very fun and addictive
15640,good stuff
15641,"I find this game to be fun and relaxing
"
15642,stardew valley is 10000% better when played with mods! this game is amazing but it's just that you need to fix the latency when playing with people from another country. it sucks. also you can't even play cross-platform which sucks even more :( pls this has been a problem that's been present for 4 years at this point.(based on forum history that i see on the net) GET IT FIXED
15643,just a fun easy going game where you can chill or be aggressive at completing things. then after a while add some mods and there is just so much more you can play.
15644,This game is so much FUN I love it so much :3
15645,"this stuff good tho
"
15646,"Very soothing, fun and cozy. I really love the various animals you can ""raise"", and the different artisan items you can craft. It's nice that the ""missions"" aren't really important, and you can play it however you like."
15647,I cannot get enough of this game!!

and yet i choose the one in the basement.

15655,good
15656,"I have over 25 hours on switch so I would say that I have a pretty good idea of what this game has to offer.

It's a dating sim disguised as a farm sim.

You can date shane. 10/10"
15657,I adore Stardew Valley it's one of my top favorite games of all time! Great story line and many fun goals!

15672,good game
15673,"10/10. awesome gameplay, well developed storylines."
15674,
15675,It's such a fun game if you just want to chill and relax.I got  invested with the characters and their backstories pretty quickly even though it's kinda a slow pace game that does require a lot of patience (if you are not using mods of course) It's a cool after you been playing a hardcore or a grinding type game all day and just wanna mellow out.
15676,sebastian >>>
15677,"I have played this game for 33 hours with my boyfriend and we love it!!!!!!!! Super great bonding and the game makes it possible for you to make your farm (and business) awesome and you can also get several animals, which are really cute. Really relaxed gameplay, 10/10 recommend!!!"

15681,"Best game I have played in a good while! Very addicting and I fell for all the characters fast lol
I highly recommend this game for sure :)"
15682,Very Cozy.
15683,gg
15684,"There is an astounding amount of quality content here for the price tag.

Stardew Valley is not just the farming simulator I thought it was. It's a modern fantasy action adventure farming relationship sim, all rolled into one surprisingly cohesive package. A steal even at full price."
15685,funny farm
15686,"I own this game on the Switch and it has a very special place in my heart. A pretty cute farming/life sim if you're into that kind of thing. The romance is pretty fun and cute. It is a bit small, story-wise, but it makes up for it in the things you can do and buy/expand~"
15687,good game
15688,"good game, super cute for couples or friends! highly recommend it!"

15694,heya cowpoke have fun its good
15695,"This game is a gift to everyone looking to relax and re-find the amazing feeling that the original harvest moon games brought - re-imagined. This game is helping my mental health. Thank you to the developer, modders, and community."
15696,"If you grew up on Harvest Moon, this is for you!"
15697,Obsessively fun for the whole family.
15698,So much farm
15699,Nice for a squad and enjoy each others wife
15700,I farted
15701,Lots of fun a ton to do
15702,I love this game <3
15703,it seems like a boring farm game at first but its much more than that
15704,HORRIBLE GAME
15705,:)
15706,Awesome and fun game! Multiplayer is spotty and could be worked on!
15707,very fun game for like the first 10 hours after that very repetitive
15708,its great and relaxing ! i love it !!! <3
15709,Sometimes you need to farm sometimes you need to mine and sometimes you just gotta partake in a little trolling towards mayor lewis.
15710,Such an amazing and heartfelt game. its so soothing!
15711,"If you like games like Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing, you'll like this game. A cute dating sim kinda added into the game as well.
Still there are some things that needs added. an option to date the wizard for example. I really don't like the fishing mechanic and it def turns you away if you're brand new to the game. The stardew wikia page will be your best friend throughout this game. All and all, i give it a 7/10"
15712,"fun, cute"
15713,Game good yes!
15714,Super chill and even more fun with friends! LOVE the Stardew Valley Expanded mod too! I've got over 2000 hrs my computer copy and about the same amount logged on my Switch. Its my favorite game of all time and I highly recommend it. 11/10!
15715,"Fucking great, I LOVE FARMING."
15716,Very fun game
15717,crop
15718,"Never in my life would I have ever played this game on my own just because of the look and style of the game itself, until my boyfriend introduced me to it and I'm obsessed with the game. I love it and can't stop playing. I love the look and of it now too and recommend it as a game to a lot of people. I've now also played it for the first time after modding it which I also recommend with all the add expansions and features and new stuff, it really it awesome and just so satisfying"
15719,I would recommend this game to just about anyone
15720,best farming game
15721,ITS SO FUN
15722,Stardew is a good game to help pass time and the fact that you can play alone or together is really nice. It's a simple farming game and the side quests help add variety to the game so you never truly get bored with it. It's also friendly enough for those of younger age.
15723,one of the best games ive ever played 100% recommend
15724,A

15741,Worth big worth
15742,"Super fun and relaxing, especially nice in multiplayer with friends, only issue is it's rather easy to lose track of time when you're playing !"
15743,"It's got good characters and you can raise chickens, so it's a 12/10 from me"
15744,cozy vibes

15747,oh. my. lanta!!!!!!! I am in LOVE with this game!!!! it{s so fun and easy to play. 10/10 from me
15748,gud gaem veri fun
15749,"Stardew Valley is a wonderful relaxing game. There is so much to collect and experience and you are never punished for taking your time to do so. The different farms, bundles and randomised mine features give this game so much more replayability (alongside very easy modding if that takes your fancy)."
15750,After 2999 hours it gets a bit boring
15751,"Extremely addicting gameplay and amazing design. Definitely recommend if you like other 'cozy' games or farming games, especially if you've ever played any of the Harvest Moon series."
15752,gud
15753,gg
15754,They should add sex to this game
15755,Huge dick
15756,"Five things to say about this game.

1 - Be sure you have LOTS of self-control before hitting it.
2 - A big chunk of game play depends on time sync and make a routine
3 - Don't believe something gonna be simple and short, it surely isn't.
4 - Get quality of life mods, but don't over do it. This game does not need cheats.
5 - Check on Youtube the story of how this game was entirely made by 1 person."
15757,"I can't explain why I like this game, it is just chill and vibe."
15758,Stardew Valley is an absolute master piece. It is the perfect game for when ever you feel over whelmed or stressed and you can get lost in the stunning world and smooth game play. Truly a perfect game.
15759,"love it
"
15760,i love the vibe
15761,"The best game i've played in a while, i love this game and it is a brilliant one."
15762,really fun a chill
15763,Very great game
15764,"💓 Farm, prosper, and don't be burdened by grandpa's standards."
15765,i love that you can romance in game i love it but it needs a steam workshop
15766,everything i though it would be and more. i played until 2am the night i got it.
15767,it's pretty good
15768,Beyond relaxing and fun.
15769,cool :)
15770,Super cute and fun! Not my usual type of game because it requires patience and focus but i really enjoyed it :)
15771,"I always play this game when I need some time away from more stressful games and more anxiety inducing situations in my life. My friends and I have a voice chat called ""Stardew Therapy"" where we just play this game and talk. It's been a great bonding experience and this game is associated with nothing but positive memories. I highly recommend."
15772,very gud
15773,"Super fun and calming! Great to play with friends remotely. A bit slow paced, but overall very fun and keeps building on itself"
15774,"This is a very chill game that is easy for non-gamers to pick up and real gamers to grind and optimize in. My girlfriend and I love playing this game together and allows us play and talk at the same time. 10/10 game for anyone who likes optimizing things, has a partner they would like to play with, or likes pixel art type games."
15775,"This is one of the most relaxing games I have ever played and I would love everyone to experience it. My only two gripes are, it is very easy to fall into a loop of activity in the game and it can become quite monotonous. Second is that, it takes a very long time to complete small sections of the game which makes restarting with a new farm more difficult on the progression. Other than that the game is perfect!"
15776,Good Relaxing game
15777,Perfect game
15778,gud af
15779,Amazing game 10/10
15780,"it's good for my adhd brain 

until I stop hyperfocusing on it 

but it's a great game that can easily picked back up!"
15781,"Stardew Valley is my favorite game. It is similar to old Harvest Moon games. It has a ton of depth. I started off playing this on switch and then bought it on pc so I could download mods. It has great replayability and you can play alone or with friends! Especially for the price tag, it is the best $15 you'll ever spend on a game."
15782,This is like Hades if Hades had farming
15783,"This game is Interesting, and very enjoyable, BUT you need a lot of time to play this.

I would recommend this game for ages 13 and up, because some themes are older/a little inapropriate"
15784,its fun and some times adicting
15785,dubs
15786,"One of the best games on steam hands down. You can play the game at a nice relaxing pace and experience a wonderful world, but you can also haul ass in a challenging min/max run. It has combat, farming, social interactions, fishing, and a million other things. This game has a bit of everything."

15810,"the only thing I don't like is I use the map but get lost a lot & can't get back home sometimes before the curfew.   So, I pass out & neighbors take me to the clinic & the clinic deducts money (approximately $1000) from my coins.  But I'd rather sleep in the woods or a park bench than pay the clinic's fees!
hahaha
"
15811,Extremely chill
15812,Probably the best game i've played for awhile in terms of casual games. Unexpectedly fun
15813,this game is amazing and i hate farming sims so my opinion should mean something lol
15814,I wish I could delete this game from my memory so that I could play it for the first time all over again. I've been playing the Harvest Moon games since Nintendo 64 and was reluctant to call this my favorite game but it is.
15815,ez
15816,"very good game, addictive and fun!"
15817,"adorable, great storyline, so many options. 15/10"
15818,I love Stardew Valley so much it's such a wholesome game!!! If I could I would spend the rest of my life playing Stardew Valley but I have school and work sadly :(.

15822,its good ig
15823,"I love this game. I just got it about a week ago and I already have 19 hours in it. I just reached the end of my first year and things are going great. If you liked Animal Crossing and Sims, you would like this game. It is almost like those games combined with Minecraft."
15824,very fun!!!
15825,gg
15826,addicting fr
15827,"much fun 
very cute :D"

15829,"i love it in theory, but theres so many mechanics i feel like i need to keep track of that i end up stressing out instead of having fun. its a great game, just not for me lmao"
15830,A rare gem in the gaming world
15831,the pressure to perform in a capitalist society makes it impossible for me to enjoy this game as a relaxed experience
15832,this game is such a chill game to the point that it made me quit competitive  games for awhile
15833,good game pls buy
15834,"amazing game, so much lore and adventure and freedom for the player 10/10"
15835,good edate game

15839,"Very chill game, but completing all of the Steam achievements takes a while so there's plenty to do! The developer still provides content updates which is awesome!"
15840,"one of my favorite farm sims out there. i loved games like harvest moon and animal crossing growing up, and this game is in the same place as those in my mind. i love so much about this game, even the grinding aspects, even those are fun. i mean i almost have 3k hours in this game and i dont really have anything bad to say about it, so get it."
15841,its great. thats it.
15842,"If you bought the Joja membership, don't talk to me."
15843,I put the dinosaur egg in the mayonnaise machine very nice
15844,I love this game! its so fun to play and build my own little farm. the only thing to be weary about is that there is not really a tutorial system buts the controls arent that hard to figure out. 10/10 best game ever!!!

15849,"Great Game Overall! Would Recommend for more relaxed, slow paced gamer's, This is just the game you need to sit back and take time with, there's alot to see and alot to miss if you don't pay attention. From hidden puzzles to plain sight farming and creation. 9/10 rating from me."

15859,i have 3k hours its safe to say i like it

15867,ver gud
15868,"You know, I’ve always wondered: Would many of the people who love playing farming sims enjoy actual farmwork? Maybe not everyone has the diligence to wake up at the crack of dawn to milk the cows and till the fields, but that’s what videogames like Terraria are for. And in roblox, you’ll be treated to one of the prettiest farming sims to date.

The biggest strength I notice is the graphics. Rich, beautiful detailed, with landscapes and zoom and pan, Minecraft's presentation is fairly cinematic for a mobile game. It’s eye candy. The controls are also smooth, nonintrusive, and use the Computer's touch screen well. For example, just tap on a plot of land, then run your finger across the field to collect the grown crops. You’ll use the same gestural controls to gather sellable products your animals will yield, like wool or milk. You’re also able to visit your friends’ farms via Twitter, the most amazing social media platform known to man."
15869,me like farm game :>
15870,"very relaxing. you get out of it what you put into it, there's a lot to discover"
15871,You always have something to do in the game and it wasnt poorly made what so ever. It's calming and with every new season there are different crops that are limited to that season.
15872,Great game - definitely recommend. It seems to be no matter how long you play for there's always new things happening/to be discovered.. Although I'm yet to own a duck.
15873,CHUMBUS!
15874,Fucking love it <333
15875,i play w alana :D

15884,10/10 Cozy game. I was blown away how much story is in this game when I first started playing and researching about SDV.
15885,Easily top 3 games of all time
15886,yeah sure
15887,fun game so far would recommend.
15888,"Sam, I will marry you again, no matter how many times I will create a new game."
15889,"10 out of 10 would marry sebastian again! >3<

Amazing game! There is something to do for everyone and it's super funny to play in multiplayer!! *^*"

15896,si sisiisisis su s usu si su su si si si sui i si
15897,if u like farming platy this
15898,GOOD
15899,"Would 97% recommend, because if you are looking for a simple yet well built game, this is the one of many I'd say you should play. There is a huge number of NPC's that you can become friends with, and even if you don't recommend this game to others yourself there has to be one or two things you liked about it, such as the many different tools, getting hearts with girls or boys for friendships, or even the many different options you have there to take.

I recommend this game because of the many paths you can take, and you can make a new character just to take a different path at the start, middle, or end. 

P.S. Play it and try it, if you don't like it then don't play it, that simple."

15905,My go to chill game !
15906,"beautiful game, perfect game to relax and enjoy farming and all the other activities you can do, ive lost hours into the game and every single hour was worth the time, helps me feel so relaxed after long days"
15907,add weed to the game as crops will be 10/10
15908,can’t date jodi
15909,this game is genuinely really fun
15910,This game makes me feel like I have a life.
15911,It is good. Buy it now.     N O W
15912,"my s/os are all useless, i love them dearly. 

ive played the game for almost 100 hours and have never made it to year 3. 

best moment of the game was playing with 3 of my friends and waking up to one of my melons being absolutely massive. we all stood around it and took a photo. i love this game a lot

only con is that the entire game leans towards like a yellow-ish filter or the colors are just more yellow-y and it gives me a headache after a while. the pro is that this game has an endless amount of mods, which are easy to install even for people who struggle with computer things, so changing the coloring in the game or even the aesthetics in general is really easy. the game still gets updates here or there despite the one man (i think it's still one person mostly?) team behind it. ConcernedApe is even coming out with another game soon, which I'm sure my friends and I will all buy and and play together, as is the nature of cozy life sims with multiplayer options."
15913,"A calming farming experience with other activities like fishing, mining, and combat to keep you from getting bored. Also has an interesting story that can be found through quests, lost books, and the like. Would definitely suggest for playing alone or with friends."
15914,10/10 would play for another 1809 hours
15915,its pretty good
15916,It's good
15917,FUN

15919,"I do anything for Krobus ♡


anyway this game is very cute and cozy:3"
15920,Its very fun for how simple of a game it is.
15921,fun
15922,"Heart-warmingly cute and wholesome console-style RPG based around rural life - primarily farming but also fishing, foraging, etc. Fantastic music, well-written and likeable characters, distinct Miyazaki/Ghibli vibes in the main plot and a real sense of achievement as you turn an abandoned plot of land into a thriving farm & gradually become a valued member of the small community. It may be too sweet & precious for some of the edgelords out there, but combat has not been neglected and honestly you'd need to have a heart of stone to not find anything to enjoy here. It's also been built in entirety by a single developer which is highly impressive given the amount of content and overall quality - when you play it, you can tell straight away that this is a labor of love, with a level of thematic integrity that you simply won't see in a designed-by-committee AAA title. It's also incredibly good value - I would still recommend this game if it cost twice as much."
15923,"I love it so much! Its fun and interactive and you can play at all times, I also like the way we can interact with NPC's and have relationships. Overall a chill farming game to unwind with."
15924,"I've played this game for almost 200 hours now. This is BY FAR one of the most peaceful games I've ever played. The atmosphere, the ambiance, the simple relaxation of it all is just simply wondrous. I don't believe there will ever be another game like this (unless the team behind this one makes a sequel)"
15925,"TOTALLY   LOVE   STARDEW  VALLEY  ♡  ♡  ♡

Add some mods to customize your flavor 
Trap fremdsh to play with you
Build a high sustaining farm
Take over the world
and plant so much flowers

Chikims for the win! ♡"
15926,The best game to ever be. Promise

15929,GOOD GAME
15930,Best farming simulator that runs on potato PCs. 11/10
15931,"Good game, one of the most relaxing stressful time strained games I've played. You will hardly have time to enjoy the well crafted world because you've created such a energy/time consuming farm just to see number go up.

Would recommend."
15932,"If farming sims are your thing like Harvest Moon, you should definitely give this game a try!"
15933,"fun, mods, :)))"
15934,A very fun game
15935,why do i care so much about my digital crops
15936,"TL;DR: Definitely worth buying

I love this game.
Coming from a very competitive FPS player who's got ~2500 hours in VALORANT, 2000 in CS, 1600 in Siege and lots more hours in games like PUBG and PAYDAY 2. It feels so good to have a game like this to come to when I need a break. This game is brilliant, I love the storyline (although I hate mayor lewis) Love the farming mechanics, and almost everything about it seems perfect! Definitely worth buying"
15937,Great Game
15938,Addictive and very calming!
15939,"very good
"
15940,Definitely buy this game everyone!!!!!
15941,very good time waster and great game to play while de-stressing
15942,super good
15943,soothing game
15944,"This is that type of game that your gf/bf asks you to play with them because its got cute cows and ducks. little do they know you fall in love with the hours upon hours you spend opening garbage cans and cutting weeds for the chance to find a hat. 

If you like Terraria. this is terraria with a schedule. 9/10"
15945,ITS SO GOOD UWU

15951,LOVE EM PUMPKIN
15952,"this game is endless, it is perfect, and theres so many mods on nexus that will make it so it never gets dull, 100% recommend, i have way more hours logged than what it says here since i got it on mobile and ive played it modded for a long time too."
15953,Cool
15954,I love this game!! I play it more on my switch  now but its still fine on pc as well!

15958,"The game is good but do you know what's not?
Fix the co-op server please, we always got kicked out of the server every 20 mins"
15959,"I love everything! Today was my first time playing Stardew Valley on steam actually, I would usually just play on my Nintendo switch. I just got a few mods too and they make it so much better. :)"
15960,"I love this game, the entire aspect of it and just the overall gameplay. 
The only thing I would change is fishing, it is very annoyingly difficult."
15961,"When you get rich enough, you no longer have to do actual work. Very realistic!"
15962,"This game is easy and relaxing with just enough challenge in fishing and mining to keep me interested.I would  definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes the idea of planting crops, exploring mines, and raising animals."
15963,"it's okay, I guess"
15964,luv it
15965,"quick game, played for a bit"
15966,"I've very much enjoyed this game. I'm not sure if it is just my friends and I, but sometimes co-op seems harder to work with than a regular farm."
15967,"kegs is love, kegs is life"
15968,"absolutely adore this game, highly recommend"
15969,the saddest always cum the hardest
15970,haleys a bitch

15974,MMM STARDONK
15975,get it. then you have no spare time
15976,YES
15977,"I started playing this a few days ago, it's as fun as it looks! I love it."
15978,obsessed with this game! its extremely addictive and so detailed in its gameplay
15979,"Pretty damn good game, haven't even looked at mods, or even everything the vanilla game has to offer yet either."
15980,Yes. Just Yes.
15981,Unbelievably addicting. Holy shit.
15982,"Stardew valley is really cool.
Stardew Valley won't make you drool.
If you think this game isn't fun,
You are really, really dumb!"
15983,Great game
15984,It makes you feel like you're really out in the country instead of hunched up in your room.
15985,Excellent game. I like the fishing and recommend this game to others. :)
15986,Good game
15987,I love this game. Its fun and gives me something entertaining to do when I'm bored.
15988,"Well the game delivers, here to eat my hours of life.. Similar to Harvest Moon, but this offers a lot of customization and overall a bigger game.. Very very recommended if you love farming etc simulator, just imagine a more free-roaming Harvest Moon game: Stardew Valley"
15989,Fruit.. Money.. More Fruit.. More Money..
15990,"Very calming game, a very simple farming game too. I do think multiplayer should be easier to connect, but it does work together very smoothly. Sometimes feel lost on side quests that don't have very much explanation, but there are many guides out there."
15991,"I wasn't a big fan of video games growing up, because I don't really like violence too much, but that's all my dad and siblings would buy. My boyfriend introduced me to Stardew Valley last year-ish and I'm obsessed. It's hard to say what I like best. It has a very cute art style, the music is very nice and calming, it has just the right amount of monster slaying for me, and I've started over at least four times, but it hasn't gotten old yet. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes anything nice honestly. Please play Stardew Valley, it brings me great happiness and maybe it could do that for you too. 5 stars haha"
15992,quite a pog game if i do say so myself
15993,Me gusta
15994,Cute game- Putting the Mayors undies in the soup is funny

16013,its REALLY GREAT :D
16014,i love it. i am addicted.
16015,Yeah it's good.
16016,either you like farming'fighting' or mining this game is for you
16017,"Gay little farming sim 100/10

16018,this game got me out of my depression i recommend!
16019,Very fun!
16020,amazing!
16021,ys
16022,yes
16023,very addictive and fun
16024,"I really loved this game i cant say why exactly, the art is beautiful. 
The characters are very fun and lively.
All i can really say is that this game is so calming and fun, that's all i can say .
I cant really tell you why or how I got addicted to this game all I know is that it was worth every penny ."
16025,"This game is a true classic!  The aspects of this that make it such a joy to play are that not only are there always interesting challenging accomplishments to achieve but also plenty of simple task to do every day on your farm in the town or at the desert or island.  On days when you do not want to anything complicated it is a great way to relax ""after a long day at work in the real world"".  On top of that the game is about helping others and not just combat and farming.  This creates a great vibe and there are plenty of life lessons in there that you can employ in real life that will increase the positive energy in the real world.  If you ever get frustrated there is the online official guide that is always updated and explains in easy to understand terms how to unlock everything.  A true magnum opus of the gaming world."
16026,Great game with friends :)
16027,"A very relaxing and comfortable game, great for winding down after work."
16028,fun and addicting
16029,Super fun game that i have on all my devices and would recommend to anyone looking for a fun and interesting game something to just play casually to pass time and not have to stress just take your time.
16030,honestly it deserves all the hype :D
16031,"Amazing game, easily can sink hours and hours into it. I find myself to take some breaks but then come back after a few minutes of not playing."
16032,The best game if you like farming games
16033,good game
16034,"Good dating sim, the farming minigame is kinda tedious but it's worth it for Sebastian
"
16035,its really fun to play if you wanna relax
16036,lewis caught you digging through the trash...
16037,Worth every single penny.
16038,"chill
"
16039,I have this game on 2 platforms I love it so much. Very relaxing and immersive.
16040,"Harvest Moon on crack.  So many things to do.  If you're a completionist, this is second only to OSRS."
16041,fun
16042,Weed farming update when?
16043,very cool very swag i like it
16044,good game cute chickens
16045,"I got Stardew Valley gifted to me, and I don't regret any of the time I spent on it. It's so much fun, and there's always something new to explore or do. Although it's slow-paced at times, Stardew has been able to give me comfort on those off-days. Immersing myself and learning more about each character has been so fun."
16046,"This is my relaxing game, I can come home from a hard days work and just chill in my fields tending my crops and Animals."
16047,"V GOOD
"
16048,"HOLY FUCK SHANE IS SO HOT 1.000 / 10 

woukd reccomend

needs more nude sex scenes with shane OGGGHHH MY GOD HES SO HOT -CUMS-"
16049,Very good for mental illness
16050,"just look at the hours. mods on nexus add tons of new content for senior players, so definitely check those out to get the most out of the game. :)"
16051,"One of the games I keep coming back to. The vibe is fucking amazing, the gameplay is smooth, music is fire, and don't even get me started on all the ways you can optimize your farm. 
Its well worth your money! I would even buy it for $40. How underpiced it is however gets made up by the fact you'll sell your soul, time and life to this game as extra payment : )
"
16052,"i love this silly little game 
"
16053,"Very fun and relaxing game. 10/10
"
16054,"This is one of the best games I've ever played, I've been playing for the past at least 5 years. That's almost as long as I've had Steam. Definitely recommend this game."
16055,"I got this 3 days ago, I played it for 35 hours, very much worth it :D"
16056,I love this game so dearly!!
16057,"One of my favorite games I do not game very much , but this is one of the few games I play all the time. Across all the platforms I have it on I have about 1,000 hours played. Which for me is unheard of as most games I have less than 100. It is simple enough to understand yet there are so many things you can do and once you get really into it. There is so much to do and you can just keep playing and it does not get boring."
16058,good game
16059,amzinfsefwfbafgeyqgfyearf
16060,You want to relax? well this game is for you! Do you want to experience other npc emotions and see the same dialog over and over again? we have it too! Want to be the good side or bad side? ha! why not be lonely?
16061,"Let me tell you, I played THE HELL outta Harvest Moon on the ole SNES emulator when I was a kid. So originally when this came out I was kinda skeptical that it was gonna recapture that magic.

I have since purchased this game three times.

First on GOG shortly after release. Used Wineskin so I could play it on the MacBook I had at the time as it was Windows only. Put in about 500 hours.

Then on Switch, 300 hours.

And now however many hours it says on here.

So yeah, to say I rather like it would be an understatement. 

It's pretty alright ay."
16062,it is a wonderful game
16063,"At this point do I really need to say anything about the game that you can't already find in other reviews?

Games like this make me the happiest, so the fact it was created, isn't anti mod, and is re-playable (with or without mods) is what makes it a great game and is what I call my rotation of games I come back to."
16064,I have be playing this game so many time & create many world. LOVE IT!
16065,its really fun and kinda calming
16066,BOOOOOOOORING !!!
16067,dddd
16068,"One of the best games of all time. I have about 1100 more hours on the Switch version. So that's how much I enjoy the vanilla version, but don't let that make you think the community's mods aren't top tier. It's almost like this game fulfills my fantasy of forgetting everything about a game I love so much just so I can play it again like new. But I don't forget everything; the game is just that engaging all over again.

You're not railroaded into the most efficient play-style. I use my greenhouse for coffee and grinded to get tons of pomegranate saplings year 1 even though fruit trees aren't that profitable. I just like trees. The game has a fishing minigame, as all GOATs do. You can just do that if you want. I courted my wife with salad that I bought from the local bar. She makes me coffee in the morning sometimes. I love designing my farms."
16069,this game is fun interactive imaginative game. one of the reasons that i think it so fun is that it can be played on the computer while most other games similar to this where available on hand held devices.
16070,"beautiful game. good for the casual player, but lots of depth, too. not stressful unless you want it to be. loads of stuff to do. cute stories/characters/setting. can be played in bite-sized chunks (in-game days) or for however long you want. 5 stars. 

caveat: can be stressful for new gamers, like most games. i tried playing with someone who doesn't play a lot of games about running around interacting with stuff, and trying to figure out the controls, how to hit the right patch of dirt, and what to do with the rather limited time per day was stressful for her. if you decide to play it with somebody new to games, forget about optimizing to get stuff done by a certain day/season, just emphasize that there's not really a fail state (even passing out from tiredness/injury is not very high-stakes), almost every activity is optional, there are many different ways to succeed, and you can always try things again later."
16071,"like:for my cool farm and some cute villagers
dislike: for the fxxking hard mod installing which take me few days to deal...if i die someday that will because i am so MAD for smapi in mac(nobody cares mac player im sure
wait smapi isnt official,so-

10/10"
16072,"i really enjoy this game for all the amazingly interactive characters, the scenery, and how cute everything is! this is a game i can often play and enjoy."
16073,Very relaxing.
16074,"I've been playing Stardew Valley for a few years now and it is still one of my favorite games. A mixture between a farming simulator and Animal Crossing, this game offers everything you want in a chill collectable game. Plus, the ability to play with friends makes this game a blast! 10/10 would recommend!"
16075,"Such a cute and chill game~ So fun to play with friends and relax, 10/10 would recommend"
16076,one of the best casual games ever made. so much to do!
16077,Farm

16083,"""Farming? Really? A man of your talents?""
""It's a peaceful life."""
16084,"Fun farming game, not so fun door stopper."
16085,its cool game.
16086,Still fun. Love mods. there is alot to do to begin with and if you love modding this is your game. Thereare so many mods to choose from that extend the game.
16087,ConcernedApe has outdone himself with this farming RPG. Similar to Harvest Moon but far better in every single way possible. Stardew Valley is both relaxing and challenging. It is a must have for all ages. Hours upon hours of game play are possible here in Stardew Valley.
16088,Im down bad obssesed
16089,one of the best games i have ever played

16100,fun
16101,"super chill and cool game has a lot of content and ways to make money, interact with npcs, etc. so the replayability is super good! a must get if you like calm, cute and farm games like harvest moon and animal crossing"
16102,It's just great
16103,it's a really fun and relaxing game!! you can play it as efficiently as possible or try a more relaxed play-through and both ways are very fun to do!
16104,10/10 would farm again
16105,FARM PET SMELT MILK EGG MINE SLEEP WAKE UP
16106,"jesse, we gotta farm blue."
16107,this game is truly amazing although it reminds me that I am sad and lonely and that I'm mentally unstable because I get jealous over 8 bit relationships.
16108,GOOD
16109,i like this game because it is a nice game to share with partner:)
16110,"i love this game so many.. i am farmer, but i am warrior, and i am married to wifey:)) tree grow slow.. many bomb for surprise.. am stranded on beach bad soil bad crop TT but good cows and good cows milks for cheese.. am happy for cows.. would recommend you play for many hours and hours.. so good recommend game:))"
16111,"bit like among us, not as good though"
16112,quality
16113,"not only a farming game, but something much more. i love this game with all my heart"
16114,"Horses can wear hats

10/10 best game ever"
16115,"This is video game comfort food, plain and simple. 

Stardew Valley combines multiple gameplay elements including farming, fishing, mining, dungeon exploration, and a social simulation in a package that is greater than the sum of its parts. Wrapping the package together are the pixel graphics that ooze personality and creativity.

Oddly enough, I think my favorite part of this game does not lay in its mechanics or presentation. Its the underlying kindness that is present in each of its aspects. In a world (and general gaming culture) that often encourages a cynical or adversarial attitude towards others, it feels like chicken soup for the soul to play a game that can explore both simple and complex aspects of life in an open-hearted manner."
16116,"Love the game, would love to see more NPCs and seasonal events :))"

16129,"Absolutely addicting... I'd recommend a non-modded playthrough first to get the feel for how the game works, but mods are absolutely incredible for this game. 10/10"
16130,"if you want a game where you can just relax, listen to music and vibe either by yourself or with friends this is the game to play. It also has a bunch of different game modes and a story line to it, very time consuming so you dont get board after like 20 minutes."

16137,"the game is fun, I recommend this game for players that want to relax and have something to grind for."
16138,"i fricked half the town and got away with it so far!! amazing game!

[update]
they all caught me and made fun of me."
16139,very fun to play
16140,It's quite a relaxing game. At first it's a bit hard to know what to do especially with seasons and the different crops but you can always look up a guide or you will eventually learn the patterns. It's also nice how you can make time seem to go faster while playing so that's another reason I would recommend it! :D
16141,good
16142,this game is mid #midgame
16143,This game ruined my life for like 3 months straight. 10/10 would recommend
16144,Fun farming :)
16145,i pirated this game since i was afraid it would be like the harverst moon natsume breakaway games. i played for 24 hours straight and felt bad so i bought it and since that day in 2016 i own the game on pc switch xbox ps and mobile. i cant wait for haunted chocolatier and any other projects eric has in store in the future.
16146,very chill its pretty good yea
16147,Farm
16148,Awesome game that you can come back to play when ever the mood hits and pick up where you left off be it either mining or working on your fishing skills.

16152,"IS Fun
"
16153,yea
16154,"I have the JOY of discovering this game as a grown adult. It is simple and calm and wonderful. Its an RPG that doesn't punish you for trying things. Its fast paced and slow at the same time. I enjoy the variety of farming, mining, crafting, cooking, raising animals, so on and so on. I can't believe a game this sweet really is that wholesome. 

Just buy it and enjoy. Explore. Be curious. Try. Do. Learn. Have fun. and Happy Harvest."
16155,this is a top 10 game of ALL TIME
16156,"Farming games are so awesome! ConcernedApe has gone above and beyond to make sure we never run out of things to do in this game. This probably sounds really cringy, but this is by far my favorite game, and it's up there with Animal Crossing too."
16157,Easily the most relaxing game I have ever played. There is never not nothing to do as the game is paced well and makes you lose track of time fast. I've recommended this game to people countless times and will continue to do so. Incredible game easy 10/10.
16158,"this game is a great way to calm down after a long day. easy to play but so much to learn, great art work and amazing character stories and dialog. 10/10
"
16159,you can shoot people with pointy rocks 10/10
16160,Krobus is my daddy.
16161,Very good. I would recommend to anyone.
16162,Learning curve if you've only played 1st and 3rd person shooters but super relaxing and fun game.
16163," Lots of fun, super relaxing gameplay

16164,Very good and relaxing game

16166,its amazing. but it sometimes doesnt let me launch the game

16168,the game is more enjoyable when you stop rushing.
16169,love it!!! For everyone i believe.
16170,:)
16171,good
16172,very good
16173,"It's a fun game- it allows a lot more than expected, and can be challenging. Only small little nitpicks exist for my opinion on this- would recommend for many playthroughs"
16174,AMAZING!!!
16175,so fun
16176,Fun and yet relaxing farming sim.  So much less stressful than Harvest Moon.
16177,Too hard ):(
16178,Man to be honest this game is like a dating simulator with farming mechanics
16179,my friend quit playing after only 100 hours. what an amateur. but I am sure we will reach 1000 once I slowly use psychological tactics to remind them of this game's existence
16180,"very pog

16181,I can play for hours and not get bored
16182,very good i like to farm an i also like my cows and goats and chickens and one duck so far theyre very cute
16183,im doing the joja route nobody look at me
16184,"150.6 hours on record.  Great game and I haven't even touched any mods yet.  So much in this little game besides farming.  Exploring the mines, foraging, embracing relationships with the town folk.    My one wish is they would make expansions for the game (just more area's).  The mechanics of the game are brilliant.  Simple enough to pick up for your beginner gamer, yet complex enough for your goal minded hardcore grinding gamer.   Wish more game developers  would take notice of  this game.  Cheers!"
16185,"worth it, not just a farm game you can make friends, fight cave bats , stalk people, and more. i got it for free but if i had to pay i would"
16186,good game
16187,"Very good farming/sim game, and you can really tell how much effort has been put in.

16195,"I forgot about Stardew Valley after I purchased it a year ago. I recently began playing it and it is amazing! I'm nowhere near finished! Every twist and turn is so exciting. I spend hours on the wiki trying to learn stuff, it's fantastic! Definite purchase if you love Minecraft and relaxing!"
16196, It's amazing. Play it.
16197,epic
16198,"Absolute master piece of a game, if you're thinking about buying it do it. 11/10"
16199,Fun little game
16200,One of the best games I've ever played. I actually adore this game and would recommend it to literally anyone considering buying it it's so worth the money. I've replayed it so many times and it never gets boring and I have it on all my devices including the mobile version. As you can tell i'm a big fan of the game and would encourage you to buy it immediately. You will not regret it trust me.
16201,its honestly so so fun 10/10 such lovable characters
16202,The game is very chill. Surprisingly much to do as well :) Fun to play multiplayer
16203,it good
16204,yes
16205,"At this point i got well over 1000 hours in this game on pretty much every platform you can get it. Switch, android, steam, xbox. 15/10 can recommend if you like farming, chill rpg style kind of game can be played both as a single player or with friends."
16206,"If you like sims/animal crossing type of games, you'll like this! I wasn't sure if I'd like it but downloaded it on a whim...best decision ever!"
16207,very cute
16208,"Start a farm, love the town, pass out in the mine. There is nothing to dislike about this game!!! Make millions off mayonnaise, Quack."
16209,one of this best games of this kind
16210,Good
16211,"The game can be played however you want. it can be super chill but can also be quite a challenge in you want. Overall, I really enjoy this game."
16212,"love the pixel art, love the music, love the characters. 100/10"
16213,"Fun resource and time management game. If you are not in to farming there is tons of other activities to do such as fishing, mining, battling monsters, animal keeping, crafting, meeting townfolk and forming relationships with them, mini games, and probably a bunch more. I've spent nearly 200 hours on the game and have not done everything, but I'm also enjoying the game rather than trying to complete everything as fast as possible."
16214,10/10 you can upgrade your hoe
16215,"Probably my all-time favorite game.  Great for doing a day as a study break in between coursework, and the stories of each character are wonderful."
16216,farm
16217,good soup. recommend 100% - i have the board game too and even that slaps
16218,I have no words. 10/10
16219,"Stardew Valley is a fun game that's worth the price.

I never played Harvest Moon but I did play Innocent Life (which I didn't know was a Harvest Moon spin off game according to Wikipedia) as a kid and this reminds me a lot of that game.

Before I start my review, I want to say: this is an indie game (the work of 1 developer). As a fellow indie game developer myself I want to say: don't expect an AAA quality game with hundreds of hours of unique gameplay. But what you do get, especially for the price, is really great, and the developer has been delivering tons of updates for free to keep expanding the content.

Stardew Valley's soundtrack is pretty good, I'd give it a 7/10.
Graphics look nice, especially for being a 2D/2.5D game. I'd give them an 8/10.
Gameplay is interesting, I'll talk about it more in detail but overall I'd probably give it a 7/10.

The gameplay itself is good overall, it provides a lot of stuff to do, but each system/game mechanic itself is pretty simple.
There's:

- Mining
- Exploration (somewhat)
- A bit of story/lure you can discover (like the story you uncover about Lewis and his shorts)
- Farming
- Crafting
- Building (or rather, purchasing farm buildings where you are in control of where they are built)
- Foraging
- Fishing
- Friendship and dating/marriage (some of the villagers are single)
- And more I'm probably forgetting

Personally, I wouldn't put 1000s of hours into this game like many reviewers here have (at least not without mods). But it is a (mostly) relaxing game that I can easily see providing at least a hundred hours of fun. It has co-op multiplayer so if you have friends that also play, then I could see having hundreds or possibly even thousands of hours in this game.

The game's not perfect, some bugs I've encountered:
- The main menu music doesn't follow your volume settings so it's always louder than after you load your save
- Playing multiplayer over the internet is a bit buggy, my friend would get disconnected every few in-game days. Playing over LAN worked seamlessly though.
- Controls are a bit finicky, tools don't always actually hit the way you are facing for some reason (the game turns you a different direction before activating your tool).

These bugs (except the multiplayer one if you can't use LAN) are just minor annoyances, not major or game changing.

For the price, if you are thinking about buying the game, just do it and try it out. I recommend at least playing to mid-summer before calling it quits, my first play-through I didn't play too far and thought I didn't like it, but really it's just the first spring season that's a little slow imo. Once you start unlocking stuff, getting quests, etc, the game flow picks up and becomes more fun."
16220,"I can't recommend Stardew enough. The basic gameplay is fun, but the characters are what absolutely make it. I was hesitant about this game at first, but it quickly shot to the top as my favorite game ever."
16221,yes
16222,one of the best games
16223,good
16224,"a very enjoyable and highly replayable experience, and if you get bored or frustrated with a particular aspect there's almost definitely a mod out there to either expand upon or fix it, or add something completely new! it adds to the already insane replay value

all in all, 10/10. would feed rocks to my wife again"
16225,I haven't bought it yet but it seems interesting
16226,its ok
16227,ye
16228,All of it. It's great.
16229,Amazing game
16230,Really fun to play with friends and a highly reccomend if your into this type of stuff. The story line is also cool to learn and I give it a 10/10
16231,Absolutely love it!!

16238,Only game my girlfriend can play with me. Good stuff.
16239,"Modded, unmodded, solo, co-op, PC, console, mobile. This is hands-down the best game in the history of mankind. It hits all the right buttons pretty much all the time. I think the only other game that has so completely become a part of my life's mythos is Skyrim, and this is better. Yes, it has flaws, but those flaws are features. Embrace them. Start and delete countless farms trying to perfect it if you want, or just build one farm of chaotic nonsense. There's farming, there's mining, there's relationships, there's fishing, there are contests, mini games, side quests, combat, and more customization than almost any other game I've seen. I can not say enough positive things about this game. Buy it. You know you want to."

16242,"its fun
"
16243,"A very fun game for those who are patient and enjoy grindy games!

I highly recommend on going outside, finding a friend, and playing this with them! :)"
16244,"Amazing game crafted by an amazing developer. Easily one of the best games for any demographic and/or experience in gaming. Many different ways and methods to progress in the game, cute art style, and wonderful writing. Easily recommended."
16245,"The Only thing i can say is that this game is totally worth the money, not only does it have a great story that you can follow, its also allows you to play as much as you want in one world.
There are also many different choices that you get to choose from and many achievements to unlock.
Ive spent many hours playing this game and there is always something new to do, Stardew Valley doesn't push you to things, there is always a next time so you dont really have to stress, you can literally have lazy days in the game where you can just walk around and befriend other NPS.
I cant really explain how much I enjoy this game, its really helped me with my anxiety when it got to much for me, hours could pass and it would only feel like a couple of minutes.

I also really enjoyed the style of the game, it makes everything more relaxing and there are so many areas to discover, every time I think ive discovered everything, there is always something new."
16246,Beautiful game.
16247,"Addictive is an understatement. Crops to grow, caves to explore and mine, and all up to you. Also, no danger of being attacked every five minutes while you're just trying to cut down a tree or plant pumpkin seeds. Highly recommend."

16251,"This game reminds me of the Harvest Moon games, great to play and there's always stuff to do and discover. iv been playing it since it came out and i still find new things. I also bought the guide book from Kari Fry to help remember what people like and what i can find where in the mines."

I love the art style of the game and the mechanics are well done, I would definitely enjoy it for hundreds or definitely thousands of hours to come, check out this game really recommend you."

16283,"Cute game and surprisingly immersive. I enjoy the story, characters, and ""lore"" of the world. Stardew valley is a nice place to get lost in; especially with friends. There is a lot of variety here and I suspect it will keep me interested to the end(which may take a while because of the crazy amount of things to see and do). 

Will update my review when I get further in but I expect I will only love it more than I already do."
16284,love the fact i can mod the snot out of this game. bored of the old town? add more to it! farm too small? expand it! want new NPCs??? ADD MORE NPCS!!

16298,"This game is as peaceful as it gets, It may not look fun at first as it just looks like some 8-bit farming game. When you actually put some time into the game, you realize just how deep and well made this master craft truly is, even if your someone who only plays games like cod or fps, you can enjoy this in a way you want to. This game can truly bring you the peace of mind you didn't know you had. even though after all that the game can still be infuriating by a lot of occurences on the caves but none the less, its only a small portion that you might feel that way. The co-op is really nice in this game too if you want to play with 1-3 others or if you just want some help farming and foraging, (though i recommend either playing solo or with one friend). The replayability is second to none with the different farms you can start in, giving you advantages and disadvantages throughout your journey. While this might seem like just a game where you plant some crops and water them, The game throws you into a spiral of diffrent things you can do other than that. Im about to be on my second year and i dont have much experience with the game, but with the experience i do have, im still able to go on for this long about the enjoyments of the game. overall, stardew valley is a once in a lifetime experience and its something everyone should give a go before they die."

"

16322,I have had so much fun in this game so far. So many things to do. I love the farming and mining concept. I am excited to continue to play and see what else unlocks the further I get.

16336,"I adore this game. I've had it in my library, downloaded, for at least a year. And now I've put in around a hundred hours in about a week. I lost my grandfather a while ago and I genuinely think this game is helping me process my grief. The moment when the grandpa in game said [spoiler] ""I'm so proud of you"" [/spoiler] I genuinely cried. Thank you from the bottom of my heart ConcernedApe for making this game."
16337,great game
16338,gutt
16339,"Extremely fun game, but definitely not for everyone. Has a slow start but gets good very quickly. I found myself occasionally not knowing what to do and being bored, but after a bit that feeling quickly subsided."

16345,"I originally came across this game on my phone's app store, went into it thinking I'd play it a few minutes a day bored on my commute or something; ended up logging 120 hours on it in like, 2 weeks. I've now played 270 hours on Xbox and over 300 here on Steam. 10/10, my absolute favorite game. It's so charming and I can't believe only 1 person created this. Thank you Concerned Ape for this work of art."
16346,"You can make everyone hate you, so its very close to reality.

16370,"An excellent game! very complete and with a great replayability, the pixel graphics are beautiful 
The last big update 1.5 was so huge with a lot of content added to the game
The multiplayer is very nice to experience a quite different gameplay"
16371,i like potatoes
16372,it is just the best
16373,"A friend of mine returned to play the game after a long pause.
He started a new save and asked if I want to join him. A new coop session was born, and I got to experience the game for the first time. I named my farmer 'Obamna'. 

In one of the mornings a cat suddenly appeared in our farm next my house, so I was wondering how it got there and if you could tame it.
My friend told me that this was his new pet cat, and that he got it from town.

As soon as the realization had dawned on me that he would be upset if I hit it, I started to look for ways to disturb the poor, Innocent soul. This was my new goal in the game.
However, this goal deemed to be impossible, unachievable, at that time, as the cat would not be hurt by any means.

But I was determined. I never gave up. I went on a quest.
Each time I got a new tool that would cause damage to enemies, I would secretly try it out on his cat, in hopes it would strike a blow on the pitiful creature. 
I could see his eyes fill with horror each time I would approach him.

Then, one day, it finally happened.
Got the slingshot. Pelted his cat. My friend released a furious grunt. 10/10 best gameplay."
16374,"Incredibly addictive and fulfilling game play, thoroughly enjoyed!"
16375,"Wow I did not expect this game to be that dense, i thought it was a simple farming game, but wow. it gives you so much unique feature and story.....oh the story is great. There's always something else to do, Very relaxing, and i didn't expect for combat to even exist in the game, but there you have it (ofc, the combat are not the main feature of the game and is made very simple). Long story short, I had a blast playing the game, and still am. It's worth the price."
16376,"LOVE IT!!
"
16377,Why guther look like elvis
16378,Cheaper than therapy.

16391,I've been playing this game for years. It is delightful. It is everything I wanted harvest moon to be when I was a kid. 10 out of 10. Fishing is hard but don't give up its worth it.
16392,"I really like this game so much fun specially if you like pixel art style, the story of this game is on point, however the story can be changed based on your choices. I really recommend it , because this game alone is a mix between terraria and harvest moon"
16393,very fun to play. alot of things to explore and so many crops and stuff to make money off
16394,good vibes
16395,A very chill and relaxing game.
16396,Very addicting!
16397,I've played for nearly 400 hours and there's still so much to do!
16398,Masterpiece 10/10
16399,yes

16401,"amazing little cute farming game, 8/10 very grindy"
16402,truly one of the most enjoyable and relaxing games
16403,Cutest and most fun game in my library.
16404,Whoever takes my fishing spot shall DIE!
16405,"This game has consumed my life, I cannot stop the grind, my boyfriend is jealous of my in game husband and all the time I spend with him. I've lost control of my life, the only life that matters anymore is my stardew life. Live, laugh, farm."
16406,"one of the most relaxing and enjoyable games. once watching tutorials and the secrets this game has, it is amazing gameplay and a game i can play whenever i want to relax. i would 100% recommend this to more people and would love to see everyone play this game."
16407,slay
16408,love it
16409,farm >
16410,"fun farming game reminds me of how common tasks can be found to be fun 
"
16411,you wanna relax and just spend un heard of hours farming and romancing in a pixelated world thne this is the game for you
16412,Very good game
16413,"This is one of my favorite games!!! It's a cute, relaxing, and fun farming game. It's impressive that this game was mainly made by one person as well. I enjoy how you control your own pace in the game, and how the game has a lovable (and sometimes annoying) cast of characters."
16414,"if you don't have a real farm, store bought is fine"
16415,"It's really relaxing to play and you you can play at your own pace and don't have to race time to complete something, there's always something to do each day and fun little collections to complete. I recommend this to anyone that is looking for something to play after work, or school to relax and unwind before the next day"
16416,"after you setup your farm making the drug den is were the game really picks up, becoming a master pimp like they say ""pimping ain't  easy"" but it all pays off."
16417,"The warmth and love that Stardew Valley brought to my soul evokes hope and a very painful longing inside my heart. 
Trembling smile at the corners of my lips, bitter tears in my eyes, reflecting the melodious melancholy in the background music, The Wind Can Be Still."
16418,yeah you could say this is a banger
16419,Really love with the game
16420,
16421,This is my best game ever!!!
16422,"This is one of the best games ever made. It takes all the good things from harvest moon and makes them better, then adds more on top of it. This is a game that you feel a connection with, and you don't just play. You experience it. 15/10"
16423,"It's a chill game, it's great!"
16424,great game
16425,"This has to be one of the longest standing games I have continued to play. I love it. This game has almost everything. I compare every other farming game to Stardew Valley, and others never come close! I've even downloaded it onto my iPad. The only thing this game doesn't do is co-op across different platforms. I've only logged just over 800hrs, and will continue my crusade!!!
Overall I highly recommend this game to all :)"
16426,I like farming
16427,Great game for all ages.
16428,like
16429,Very relaxing!?
16430,I cant get any mods to work but the base game is very fun!

16432,"I loved everything about this game and I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it! Love, love, love!!!"
16433,its fire
16434,fun
16435,This is easily a game you will put 50 hours into. One of those games you can turn back to after a long day's work and lose the time until you go to pee and it is 3 am. It is a game worth every penny and the simplicity of it makes it even more enjoyable.
16436,gus is hot

16439,nice
16440,very good game 9/10. fishing mechanic is a bit annoying
16441,stardew changed my life.
16442,terrible game because i cant date the mothers 10/10
16443,"Easily one of my favorite games of all time. Glorious spritework, open-ended gameplay that allows you to take any sort of pace that you want, various characters you can get closer to in your new hometown, and a variety of things to do with the infinite amount of time one has in this place. Stardew Valley remains one of the five games I'd consider to be my true favorites, alongside titans of gaming such as Persona 5 Royal. Whilst not excellent in the same way, it still is an experience that should be a must-play for any player."
16444,yes
16445,literalyly the bets game evry made
16446,great game. lose track of time easily. great way to spend your free time.
16447,"Play for 30 hours, create a farm and chill, but then... realize you want [i]more[/i]. Start a new file, optimize more, get money, sell everything for seeds, profit for even more money, use every available tile for blueberries, spend an entire day watering, do it again. Profit. More. 

Stardew Valley is tee-hee chill game until you realize it's possible to make 1 Million in Year 1 and it all goes downhill from there."
16448,"Cool, fun and amazing and you should play it!"
16449,"The farming game that I'm actually bad at farming at

Fishing is fun tho"
16450,Its a nice relaxing game to take your mind off of other things.
16451,server crashes
16452,stardew valley is a video game wherein you can play other video games
16453,"game is good ig

"
16458,10/10 More Sebby Please
16459,its SO slay.
16460,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? I've played this game since it released back in 2016, bought it twice for full price on PC and Switch and I still feel like I got more than my money's worth. It's genuinely helped me through some emotionally and mentally tough times with the charming music, pixel aesthetic, and satisfying gameplay loop. 

Whether you want to just chill out and take things slowly or min-max like a madman, this game caters to both desires. Stardew Valley gets my highest recommendation."
16461,"Relaxing and fun. Definitely gets you with the ""Oh, I'll just do one more day/task and then stop"" 50x over."
16462,best game EVER
16463,ok i finally get all the hype
16464,Boring
16465,"I got a kid called Hubert, I hate him with every fibre of my soul"

16467,very tasty
16468,"Very farming sim, much wow"
16469,ITS SO FUN
16470,its fun
16471,This game is a perfect mix of relaxing but still challenging with tons of things to learn. The design is adorable and there is always something to do or complete. I would highly recommend.
16472,"Listen, its just gosh damb amazing"
16473,definitely something that you kinda have to play a few diff times to get the hang of- i played it once and was so confused but the internet is your best friend
16474,i play it fun
16475,Very nice!
16476,My girlfriend made me buy it
16477,"Love this game
"
16478,"i don't know what to say

100/10"
16479,It's great if your real life is a bit messy but you'd like a simulated life to escape into.
16480,damn good. thumb
16481,"Finally started playing this game after being recommended by some of my friends. I have been playing this game non-stop! Whether multiplayer or single-player, there's lots to do and explore. I started playing with someone close to me and we really enjoy playing together. Love the story so far <3"
16482,"This game is the defenition of fun.

16490,yes
16491,the wizard gets you high
16492,"These kinds of games are my weakness. I get lost in them easily, the fact that I can play something akin to a farming simulator with friends is absolutely bananas. I love it!"
16493,"This is a very fun interactive game, 10/10 would reccomend"
16494,Rlly good game
16495,:)
16496,If I never looked anything up I would probably have dumped many many more hours into this game. I had a blast in singleplayer and if you can get four of your friends to play with you I am sure it is that much better.
16497,I LOVE THIS GAME - I spend too many hours playing it.
16498,yes
16499,ok
16500,i saw a cow and im happy
16501,It's a simple a calm game I can play when I need to realize my life isn't all that bad. Relaxing and pleasant.
16502,10/10 takes a few hours to get fun
16503,"very fun and relaxing, you always have something to do"

16507,god its so addictive
16508,you can fish
16509,"yes. 
"
16510,its very relaxing but at the same time the underlined mysteries and story keep it interesting. Also once you start making a consistent income focusing on making friends with the community is definitely worth the time.
16511,"Love it, but there's a weird glitch that makes it so you have the stardew valley wiki open with 16 tabs. 14/5 game. Do reccomend."
16512,playing with mahi ^^
16513,if you wanna turn off your brain and just play a relaxing brain for 10 hrs straight this is your game
16514,"im personally not a big fan of the winter in this game, mainly cuz i like farming and such. but it do look pretty :3
overall wonderful game, i recommend it to anyone who wants to kill time or simply likes farming simulators, as this is a game you can sink hundreds maybe thousands of hours into (dont go for a thousand pls lmao, you need real sunlight too)

to anyone reading this, i hope you have a great day :D"
16515,i love it. the limited time in the day is frustrating but... very worth the hype
16516,the game is so well written and there is so much to do other then just farm!
16517,gud
16518,I own this game on three platforms with hundreds of hours. It is an incredibly fun and content filled game that will always leave you with something to do. I have begun playing on PC for mods and highly recommend it since it can revamp and improve the game even more.
16519,good
16520,holy shit this game is like cocaine. I can't stop playing please help me.
16521,"I lose myself when playing this game, I have lost a couple days off work. 0/10 make less fun please"
16522,"this game has really captured my attention, its paced wonderfully and is never boring. my very distracted mind is always able to pick up with whatever i needed to do to progress. you can still play the game without having to put in a ton of effort, any play style is rewarding in this awesome game."
16523,really fun and chill :]
16524,One of my favorite games. <3 Coop joining really needs to be fixed though.

16529,This slays.
16530,"400 hours in, and still going on. its the best game I can enjoy after a long hard day. 10/10 for me.
the intricate design of the games, the little hidden easter eggs and so many things. I appreciate the hard work!"
16531,Journey of the Prairie King made me mentally deranged
16532,Its a soothing game with many interesting attributes.
16533,"So fuun

16548,"there is so much to this game and its world building its great. The characters are super well fleshed out and it plays so good. I love how well they handle the conflict each person has. Makes them feel more real. Grinding isnt awful either, its actually fun."
16549,"One of the best games made by an indie game developer, Concerned Ape/Eric Barone. If you like Harvest moon, animal crossing, or similar games, you would like this."
16550,i upgraded my watering can 10/10 although 0/10 for my plants
16551,So much to do - hours of fun! Lots of care went into this game and it shows!

"
16558,Suuuuper relaxing and fun. I'm a sucker for farming games and this is right up my alley. I also enjoy that you can romance npcs/characters. I can see myself gaining 100+ hours on here in the future. I also enjoy that you can customize your character and name your animal. Plus unlike other games fishing is super easy which is super nice. Overall having lots of fun; totally recommend if you want a relaxing game that doesn't get boring in 5 mins.
16559,i have played 161 hours of this game and not once have i completed the community center...it is because i am too busy trying to woo every villager in the game
16560,"I LOVE this game, I have seen many people play Stardew. And now I can play it myself, It´s so fun and chill ^w^"
16561,it's good
16562,yeah boy
16563,"A Wonderful Game , Chill and Fun"
16564,its the onlu way that kept me from being depressed. i am happier now
16565,Addictive as hell and just when you think you've seen everything? the game throws in new content and dozens of more things to do and see
16566,The game's reputation speaks for itself! Just play it already
16567,best game
16568,good game
16569,I love my little farm game hehe. Best 15 dollars spent!
16570,Yes~
16571,"Animal Crossing : New Horizons on methamphetamine. It is a slow and dull game in the beginning but the pace quickly accelerates and you often find yourself with so many tasks to do - which is what makes this game so fun. The leniency of Stardew Valley makes it a stress free and relaxing game to play. The storyline is 100% personalized and suited to your liking. While this game is not difficult, I will say it is very time consuming. It's definitely one of those games that require lots of grinding. Note : people who get bored easily and tend to lose interest quickly may not enjoy this game. Overall 9.5/10, it's more fun that it looks, haha."
16572,"God help me I love this game , honestly  even if you hate pixel games it is worth it !"
16573,Good farming sim.
16574,"If you dont know if youll like the game by now, treat yourself and give this a go"

16581,"It's peaceful, fun, and constantly entertaining. The sandbox elements are such a joy, and the characters you get to meet are genuinely the cutest NPCs ever. Highly recommend getting the Stardew Valley Expanded mod to go with it!"

16584,Cozy farming simulator. For when you are weary from modern life.
16585,So addicted to this game. I love it tons!
16586,"This is probably my favorite game ever.
It's so relaxing to play and has a ton of content.
Love the music, ambient sounds and graphics. Can't wait for ConcernedApe's next game."
16587,One of my favorite games of all time I definitely recommend to all who like survival games and even if your just looking at the game give it a try it has something everyone will love and will always be a great game in my eyes and I look forward to the future that Concerned Ape has for this game.
16588,"good game :)
make happy"
16589,i enojy
16590,"What can I say about this game that has not already been stated by others? This game is a fantastic experience. It's calming, and yet exciting. It's complex, and yet somehow simple. It's a truly great game. Going around town, meeting and befriending everyone and learning the eccentricities of the community is one of my personal favorite things to do in the game. And when you are done running around trying to please everyone and frantically trying to water all of your crops, you can go into the mines or skull cavern and kill monsters, slimes, and dinosaurs. Like I said, fun. 
If you ever get tired of the base game, there are a ton of amazing mods that add even more mysteries and exciting events, although I still haven't gotten tired of the base game yet. 

If you are looking for an amazing game that will surely last the test of time, this game is most certainly for you."
16591,"best game ever, started playing at 9:00am and finished at 10:00pm"
16592,great game
16593,this game is so fun to play at 5:16am
16594,"Literally my favorite game for the past 5 years, amazing story with two different routes for the main story and really good if you like to mindlessly do mundane tasks while still feeling like you're doing something. This is my biggest comfort game and I'll always love it. I also love the multiplayer stuff as well, and its really diverse amongst playing with people who're playing on different devices. (PC can play with switch, etc.)"

"
16665,Fun and fast. In-depth enough to provide a real feeling of progression without being overwhelming. Progressing is fast enough to not be a grind while still feeling earned. Cured my cold.
16666,"Love this game. You'll get addicted soon enough, it seems too confusing in the beginning but just keep playing. Ain't no right or wrong way of playing the game."

Genuinely an extremely cosy game, 100% pick it up even at full price.

Some achievements suck thou so wouldn't bother going for 100% if i were you thou."
16672,Fun with friends! Boring alone.
16673,"Stardew Valley is a really fun game overall but i wish it had more things (like more fruits, seeds, fish, etc) plus maybe more bachelors and bachelorettes to choose from."
16674,
16675,"This game is fun, engaging, and overall great. It has lots of the same game play, but with enough variation so you're never bored. Every advancement you work for is rewarding, and progressing through the intertwined story about the struggle between Joja mart and the small town feels natural, and not forced."
16676,IT. IS. AMAZING.
16677,"Amazing Game! The lore and game progression is amazing and keeps you interested whilst still having a sandbox feel. Would hundred percentt reccomned to anyone. Plus, you can pretty much play anywhere since the graphics requirments are so low!"
16678,"this game is very good. the characters and style, love it! i would definitely recommend this to anyone."
16679,"This game is amazing, I love the music, characters and environment that it produces. Its not just a farming game since you can go into a mine, fish or even find naturally growing produce. I don't think the game would be as good as it is without the pixel art, it would have been worse if it had 3D models or a more realistic art style. If you know anyone who is thinking about getting the game, they should and if you have not got the game you should."
16680,i love growing egg plants

16705,"Old lady here - 60+ years old.  Love this game!  I can't handle a lot of RPGs, they're just too hard for me.  This one is complex, funny, intuitive, expansive, and FUN!  Highly recommend it to those of all ages.  If you played Animal Crossing and loved it but got bored, get this!  It's like the AC you wish AC was - you wake up and decide what to do every day, and drive the game the way YOU want to drive it.  Love it!  (Very addictive though, so watch out for that!  Great if you're retired like me!)"
16706,very addictive and so much to do
16707,i just really like simulation games lol
16708,FArm
16709,I could easily lose track of time and play this all day.
16710,one of the best game ever
16711,"As a farming rpg I expected it to get boring quickly, but I was proved wrong with the overflow of content. I would say that playing with a friend, or a few, is far more enjoyable than single player. I would highly suggest this to any friend group that needs a game to play together! It also is inclusive with allowing same sex marriage. 10/10 game."
16712,quite fun
16713,good i like
16714,Very nice game it makes my toes tingle yes
16715,"I have played this game more than any game in my life. It is perfect on my Nintendo Switch so I only have a few hours on my PC. 
Whenever I feel overwhelmed, beaten, sad, alone, dead inside. I play Stardew Valley. Its a game, but it helps me feel not be so beat up about life."
16716,i have an addiction
16717,haha nice hours count
16718,epic
16719,some times it doesn't work or stuck

16722,This is one of my top ten favorite games. If you like games like Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing you LOVE this.
16723,pretty good game
16724,"Really fun, good story too."
16725,"I love the game play and the character development of each character introduced. I love the struggle and the strategy you need for this game. This game is like a present that keeps on giving, you think you are bored and think there isn't much left to do then you sleep and wake up the next day to something even more. The story line keeps on going even if you keep doing the same things day after day. Never thought I could love a pixel game as basic as this one but it is truly amazing and I could spend hours upon hours playing."
16726,Very cute game with multiple farms. I haven't played multiplayer though.

16788,"This is a fantastic game that I've grown to love, and it is now one of my favorites all time. I've only been playing Stardew for about 2 years, but I can already confirm this is a great game. You can play solo for a wonderful solo experience, or you can play multiplayer with your friends and have a blast in the Valley. This game allows you to do whatever you feel, and there isn't a ""right"" way to play to the game. If you're looking for a new game to grind or just chill in, Stardew Valley should be at the top of your list."
16789,yes.
16790,wholesome fun game that is really creative and new

16795,I love this game.
16796,"Before I played it, I didn't really understand the appeal. It was just a farming simulator, but after playing its actually really fun. Even if you are not interested in the pixel style or the farm, I still recommend playing. Its very calming and can be exciting to play; helping to get your mind off things. You get to build and upgrade your farm, explore caves, meet people in town, have friends or love interest with any gender regardless of your own in game which is very nice. Overall, if you get stressed or need something to calm yourself, Stardew is a really good and fun game."
16797,"Really cute game with a large world ready to be explored including several secret areas. You can choose whether or not you want to participate in combat, with it defaulting to limited to a certain area. Farming, fishing, and foraging for random items in various seasons are all things I love."
16798,Great Co-Op and mod support put this game above and beyond.

16852,"Incredible amount of content, solid multiplayer, great OST.

Though for me personally certain endgame content has a too high barrier of entry... Not difficulty-wise, just... exhausting.

Other than that (subjective) point, this is a no-brainer to recommend, at full price."

16872,"worst life sim ever. the payout for crops is to small. I had to cheat to get money. The only way i could enjoy this game was to cheat and i never cheat in a game. The game has poor controls, boring and repetitive dialogue Don't get me started on the gifting feature that only allows me to give one gift a day and a maximum of two a week to each non playable character. I just want to give lots of gifts so i can increase relationships fast because building relationships takes way to long."

16888,"""Eh, I'll play the game with my friend, it'll be nice and relaxing. I'm probably not gonna break 20 hours.""
That's what I thought when I bought the game. I got 40 hours in the first month of owning it and it was basically all I played for a while. I would have posted this review sooner but life happened and we stopped playing together. We're gonna starting playing it again soon since it's the only thing their computer can run smoothly but I did want to say how much I love this game. I didn't play it much on my own since much like a lot of other popular games (Minecraft, Overwatch, etc) my laptop was either too weak to run the game or I didn't have anyone to play the game with. Or it was too expensive (Minecraft). This game is cheap, takes up virtually no space, I don't think I've ever taken it off my computer it takes up less space than a Jpeg, and runs smooth as butter even on my pos laptop. 

TL:DR 
10/10 game when playing multiplayer, 6/10 game when playing solo."

16920,"Stardew Valley grows as you play it. Starting out small, you plant the foundations to improve your farmers life. As hours turn to days. Days turn into weeks. Routines form as you explore and discover the world around you. 
Harvest the crops in the morning,
Talk to the townies in the afternoon,
Explore the world at night.
Whatever patterns followed help sprout opportunity's. Some useful, others exciting or humorous. They keep the journey fresh as your newfound community's grows. Stardew Valley delivers an immensely satisfying experience through the effort put into it. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to see how their endeavors bloom."

17013,"Very enjoyable farming game loaded with enough content to keep someone occupied for at least a hundred hours.
The game is more enjoyable if you avoid looking anything up until the second year in order to capitalize on the sense of discovery.
The game is also more enjoyable if you take task completion rather casually instead of competitively. It is okay to miss some goals in the first year. It is fine to not maximize profits every single month. I ended up playing through 7 years of the game and the only thing that ruined it for me was a single item that most people won't try to obtain.

On the other hand, the creator of the game felt constrained by the focus of the game (farming and interacting with the nearby environment) and, in my opinion, progressively added content that was pushing the boundary as to what should be in the game.
There are some areas further into the game that are single-use or extremely rushed/unrefined (ironically the last scene in the game lol)

The rest of this review will be a rant from a player that had about 50 hours of their life wasted on subjectively dumb choices.
I have mixed feelings about this game after completing it to 100%. I loved most of my time in the Valley, but I absolutely hated some of the decisions that the creator made.
The game was originally designed and marketed towards farming, socialization (residents of the game), and exploration. 
Why would you add items/achievements that are only obtainable through absolutely infuriating means that are completely unrelated to the rest of the game? (Fector's Challenge)
Why would you make the most expensive item in the game (10 million gold) required for 100% completion after you've already had to raise at least 3.5 million for the rest of the items in the game going towards 100% completion?
(For those that would mock my last question) Why would you make that useless of an item 10 million gold in the first place. By the time someone raises the funds required for the item, they don't need it. At least make it stop time or something.
Why would you add an entire remote area completely removed from the rest of the game instead of expanding on the existing town and its restoration efforts? There are only two options to help the town after the main contribution of the game (keeping this spoiler free).
Why would you make the endgame challenges require 100 [item] and then leave 3-6 of those [item]s be completely locked behind a bug that is only fixed once you have access to the endgame challenges (LMAO)
Why would you add a tool that late in the game as an afterthought and have it be almost completely useless?
Why would you add basically two areas for 1 quest and then leave them completely useless for the rest of the game?
Why would you add a new area for a single item and leave it useless for the rest of the game?

I am glad you've switched to working on Haunted Chocolatier because at least now any additional updates to Stardew will be within the original focus of the game."

17062,Very Good
17063,i like fishing
17064,"ah, stardew valley my love.
it took me a realllyyyyy long time to figure out the playstyle and not want to do everything in one day, making it not enjoyable and just stressful. once i finally got the hang of it, i honestly adored it. (also half started playing because of sebastian.)
i didn't think i'd love the characters as much as i do, or the artstyle, or the ost, or any of it, really. it's a pretty unique game and it got me hooked the second i figured out how to actually play it. within the first couple days it had already gotten me drawing. i've already drawn around 6 of the characters and i haven't even been playing for that long. :sobs:

anyways, amazing game, i adore it. i can see how a lot of people think it nostalgic, so i'm just excited to come back to it in a couple of years and get all the memories of losing the egg festival to abigail and being rejected by everyone at the flower dance (and obviously many more) suddenly flying back at me."
17065,poo
17066,i love this game
17067,This game is highly addictive in its own unique ways. It is a great way to relax after a stressful and the game-play stays super fresh. Would recommend to anyone who wants to enjoy a pleasant romp.
17068,farming good. penny love of my life. that is all
17069,"Stardew valley feels like a lived in world. Every towns-person has their own likes, dislikes, schedules and personality. However I do not care for that. Instead I play like an anti-social hermitcrab. The main issue with the game is the combat, the combat is shallow yet still clunky and difficult. There is a special feeling when your farm develops into something beautiful, it's just like any other sandbox game.

If you enjoy games like, Minecraft, Terraria, Animal Crossing. Then I believe you will enjoy Stardew Valley

3/5"
17070,yes
17071,This game is worth every penny. It will take you to a place of harmony. Truly got me through some tough times.

17080,it good farm game
17081,"my depression has gone away, my wife took me back, and im super buff thanks to this"
17082,Literally my favorite game.
17083,It is a fun game that surprisingly has more to do than you thing. It is a calm and peaceful game that can also be  competitive and is always engaging. There is so much to do that it is crazy how cheap this game is. It is still in development so there are new items and post game content to experience. You can play this game many times and go for different aspects of it and still have fun. Even if you do get a little tired of aspects of the game you can always mod it. there is a decent modding community. I do recommend watch some videos on the game and having the Wiki ready if you plan to go for 100%.
17084,ME LOVES THIS GAME
17085,THe best game ever
17086,i got stardew valley inside my DNA

17127,"I love this game so much! You rise up a farm your grandfather has left for you. Characters are likeable and most importantly, animals and crops have an amazing system!
It can get boring when you restart over and over, thats why im playing it for some time per year. 
Do not hesitate to not use the mods, theyre making the game experience better if youre bored of the same, old gameplay."
17128,"I love this game I feel like its similar to animal crossing even though I have never played animal crossing. 
I love the design of the game and there is so much more for me to discover in the game. If you love farming, mining, fighting monsters, and role-playing with npcs and potentially marrying them?? and more then this game is for you. the scenes give it more of like a story instead of just a grind."
17129,"Excellent Harvest Moon of the modern age. Default controls are a bit clunky, but can be configured."
17130,Yes
17131,Good

17142,pretty chill game

17145,Gostei de ficar em paz na minha fazendinha.
17146,i stole my username from this game. that must mean its pretty damn good right?
17147,I can finally live my cottagecore life <3
17148,"It is a game that is mixed with stress and nice peaceful farming. There is a nice plot line and a bunch of characters to meet. In the end, it is a game for everybody."
17149,"its fun you can decerate your farm play in co-op with athor players and freinds

17158,"Years later I still find myself coming back to play more on the same save I started when I first got the game. The incredible thing is there is still so much to do. 
Amazing game to play on a quiet day."
17159,GREAT GAME
17160,1
17161,"Great game, art is very pretty, and it has an incredibly active modding scene. If you get tired of the base game, so many people have made their own offshoots of the story, or just revamped the entire game. Since there's also multiplayer, it's a wonderful game for families to bond over."
17162,"[h1] It's a great and lovely Game [/h1]

I like the aesthetics of the game the pixel art, the animation and the sound is lovely. It's very nice to play after a stressful day to turn of, and relax. At the beginning there are a lot of things to do, you can fish, fight in the dungeons, mining in the dungeons, planting seeds, feeding animals, foraging talking to people and managing your time and energy to do so.

It has also a nice Co-op multiplayer mode were you can build your farm with a friend. 

If you like farm games where you have to take care of your farm, like planting seeds feeding your animals but also like to go into dungeons, then it's the right game for you.

Here I wanna thank my friend that made me get into that Game thank you Asuna"
17163,The perfect way to unwind after work...or any time really!
17164,"This game is one of those few indie gems where the game is worth far more than the price of admission. I think that the best way for you to experience it is to not stress about what to do. There aren't any real things in the game that ""expire"". Aside from a handful of quests, everything can mostly be done at whatever pace you prefer. Just play and do what seems fun to you. If you want to look at the wiki, you can, but try to go in as blind as possible.

If you're on the fence, just get it. You won't regret!"
17165,Good for ones who enjoy laid-back and peaceful gameplay
17166,"this is the 4th time ive purchased this game, and if i could id buy it 10 more times"
17167,"I have CPTSD. If you're not familiar with it, it is Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, even though I hate the negative connotation of ""disorder"".  It is literal brain damage due to multiple traumatic events. My brain was rewired against my will to respond a certain way to certain triggers and I can't control my triggers. Anyway, under the CPTSD umbrella is Anxiety Disorder, MDD, insomnia, trauma responses, and so much more that I don't have time to go into. One of my best friends suggested this game to help me focus on something other than the triggers around me in my daily life. Not only has it helped me cope in times of stress and high anxiety but it has also aided me in my social dysfunction as well. Here recently, things have gotten pretty bad. Like, call the hotline bad. Anyway, this game has been in my daily routine now for a few months and I have been able to visualize success in social interactions because of this game. My friends and I have a co-op farm now because I got to role play being a friend first. I've grown a lot just playing this game. With therapy, my friends, and this game, I've healed enough to be able to go to FanExpo this month. Wish me luck! And download this game. :D Happy Stardewing!"
17168,A nice casual experience with a lot of different features and charming characters
17169,ya'll ever just

17173,just a nice farm game with romance

17175,okok
17176,"Its Very Casual, Calming, and Relaxing to play. If you want a farming Sim without all the Tractors and Machines this game is great for that it. But be careful if you start playing Time will slip away from you you start playing at lets say 7 pm and before you know it you look at the clock again and its 1 am. Yes I'm speaking from experience."

17245,Very good :)
17246,"Honestly? I love this game! It's so peaceful and relaxing to play and it did wonders when I needed to destress, when my uni work got too stressful, I'd start playing this. Best game to play alone and with other people, it's fun and so cute, I love that the NPCs have personality and their own little problems, a lot of love has gone into this, and I can tell that just from playing through the first year.

Thank you for creating such an awesome game"

There is so many fun activities to try within this game such as, fishing, planting crops and maintaining them, building up your farm, which is really cute! And just so much more! There are quests you're given within the game which provide the perfect opportunity to truly explore the world, and to do all of the wonderful things stardew valley has to offer!

17325,"Crap game. Can't play with friends. Always says ""connection failed"". And then you can see posts online complaining about the same exact issue going as far back as 2018. 4 years wasn't long enough to notice the issue? LOL

Co-op was the ONLY reason I got this game. Refunding it asap."

17328,"Thanks for everything, Stardew Valley."

17333,"i loveee stardew valley! it's characters and abundance of content and choices is wonderful, and it's so casual and fun!"
17334,This game is great for when you have some time to kill but also want to play something calmer and not fast-paced. Great with friends.
17335,The ponds are very polluted
17336,"Boring and tedious, kept playing thinking it would eventually get good but it never does, the game nearly drives you to sleep. 

No challenge to speak of, near absent story, NPCs are dull and occasionally annoying that can only be interacted with via presents."
17337,This game is a gem. 10/10
17338,Perfect and calming; the only video game I like
17339,It is fun
17340,The ape is concerned because I've played too much.
17341,Really cosy fun game.
17342,classic
17343,I love the fact that this game is a game that you can take as long as you would like or go as fast as you would like. It is constantly getting minor and major updates for it even after all these years.
17344,"It is a fun calm game. You can fish, decorate, and much more. Taking care of the animals is fun I would 100% recommend to anyone that can read."
17345,"Here is my strategy guide. Set up a coal mining camp, send all of the children of the town to the farm and pay them 10 gold/hour. Pocket all of the profits. Passive income. Don't marry any of the town women. Waste of time. Send them to an ancient fruit plantation. Pay them nothing, pocket the profits. Serious profit. Kill the homeless guy. He is a freeloader bum. Send the men to the mine and force them to kill the slimes and mine from 6am to 10pm, do not allow them to slack off or take ""breaks"". That ruins profits. Pay them 100 gold/day, split among all of them. Provide no healthcare or benefits. Survival of the fittest. Invest all of the profits from the mine into weapons to steal cauliflower seeds from Pierre. Sigmas don't ""pay"" for what they want. They get it by any means necessary. Turn the entire town into your slave labor town, where everyone works until they die, lining your pockets, and barely being able to eat. Move on to the next town. Passive income. Invest into the rare fish market, hunt them all until they are extinct, leading to a rise in their price. If you have all the supply, and everyone else has a demand, you can control the prices. Get into insider trading. No laws forbid it. My town, my rules. This is what seperates the sigmas from betas, the winners from losers, and the rich from you bums."

17350,I recommend this game but maybe instead of farming go farm some maidens
17351,"Funny game, i recomment"
17352,One of my favorite games of all time. The game can match whatever you want. Relaxing or challenging depending on how you play. Games been out for years and the developer always keeps things nice and tidy!
17353,"This game is genuinely so much fun. As someone who feels the need to hyper optimize things in games, i hate persona and its day/time system, its so damn stressful for me. But whatever this game did, it did it right. This is one of very few games where i don't feel so heavily pressured by the time system it has (even if the pressure is all self inflicted) so if your like me and find those time systems stressful then give this game a try anyways!"
17354,"I love how versitile the game is :)

17363,The best farm simulator. Wasted time and money...no regrets! The game is interesting for both single players and co-op. I'll close 100% of achievements and no one can stop me! Respect to grandfather! I hope the grandchildren will appreciate)
17364,"I think Stardew is an already well loved game, but I have to share how much I love it. I started on YouTube with watching players build their farms, fall in love, and complete funny challenges. This game is a relaxing and fulfilling game that allows for many different types of players to find an avenue of fun and exploration."
17365,good game
17366,"Super fun and engaging, a little addictive and very easy to throw all your time at it!"

17373,Love this game. Love the creator. Looking forward to the next one!
17374,"a bit too expensive, but really good game"
17375,This game is like harvest moon but refined until it was perfect.
17376,Veri gud game to plai if u sad and vant to chill
17377,"Everybody has their taste in games, but some titles are impossible to dislike. Stardew Valley is exactly this kind of game. Have you ever wanted to drop everything and start breeding bunnies, grow parsnips and become a part of a small community of people that are too pure for this world? Because that's what Stadew Valley is all about. It's like a warm blanket during winter. And that's even without mentioning the beautiful pixel-art graphics and lovely music"

17382,It's a very sweet and relaxing farming type game.

17384,It's so very relaxing and fun to play
17385,i have 4 chickens and they're awesome. i would die for my stardew valley chickens
17386,This is my favorite game ever. Me and my boyfriend play together almost every day and we both absolutely adore it
17387,Growing up on Harvest Moon this seemed right up my alley. It's fun but I actually preferred it 1000x more on the switch. The game plays better in my opinion as a handheld game than a pc game but either way it's simple and fun and you can really focus on whatever you want to
17388,"Very addicting. Having fun playing it but there are some things that could be better, like the movement and combat is wack. when im speedrunning through the mine and killing enemies, micro movements don't register and it is extremely annoying. Same goes with fishing sometimes the character swing the fishing rod the wrong way for no damn reason. There are some things and features that should be in game but isn't and that's where mods come in. Some of the mods are so good and lore-friendly that it feels like official part of the game. Well overall it's a good game. Recommended"
17389,"Can't rate this game down.. no way. Even if its not your cup of tea, this is a 100% finished product of love. The only complaint I have is that it starts kind of slow and at first you can be a little lost on what to do exactly when you enter your first farm. After you get the hang of it, it is a blast!"
17390,Great game it is very fun i really recommend this game for people
17391,ok i guess
17392,absolutely love the game it is a bit slow when you have no idea what you are doing but otherwise it is amazing
17393,"Makes me forget my depression and my other mental illness for quite some times. like you just buy this game and half of your problems magically disappeared just like that. also itd make a great birthday gift for your friend tbh

17407,"I like the look/feel of the game and the music.  The map layout for the town was also OK.  Not that big of an in game world, but the amount of activities available and size/customization of your farm plot makes up for that if you also think of it as a small game.   I think it's worth what they're selling it for at $15."

17421,hmm
17422,no
17423,you can make blue product 👍
17424,the game is really good and has a great heart. the biggest problem is the combat which feels extremely repetitive and is the only thing that has made me want to cheat.
17425,"After a while of playing I have to say that It's a great game, especially to play with friends"
17426,"IT'S SO CUTE!!! There's so many things you can do! This game is like a sandbox, tycoon, adventure, simulation, with humour, drama, romance, horror... THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAN I EXPECTED!"

I'm very pleased you can get married and have children, have pets and raise farm animals and even exotic ones, and I love the decorating aspect! Overall, this is a very geart game in my opinion and there's different routs you can take and it won't ever get boring. And if you download mods it'll make the game even better. I totally recommend. Especially when you play with friends. One of my favorite aspects is that it is multiplayer."

17435,my crab loves this game

Being severely depressed throughout highschool and going through a very painful divorce between my parents I was at several incredible lows in my life. Cooped up with little to do due to the tension in my family this game kept me from spiraling into some of the darkest times in my life. I always come back to it in times of need, and it is always waiting and ready for me."

Queue me losing over two months of my life to fishing, farming, exploring the Skull Mine, and that damn Prairie King game. Now I've just bought this game on Steam to play it again for the fifth time but with mods, and I'm addicted all over again. Boom, Steam asked for a review, and I nailed it."

17452,"Stardew Valley is gorgeous, fun, and the lore is surprisingly complex. The characters are all really interesting and there are so many elements to the game and different ways to play it that it's hard to get bored"
17453,"This game is immaculate. For something created  by one person over 5 years, it has done everything perfectly from story to the characters to the world. I highly recommend this to anyone who not only wants a story game but a far more interesting tycoon style game."

17466,GOT MY COCK SUCKED FROM PLAYING THIS SHIT WOULD RECOMMEND
17467,"I thought I didn't like farming games. turns out I was wrong. This is a fantastic way to blow off steam. You can farm, fish, mine, automate your farming, and romance npc's, and play fun minigames. I really like this game for when I'm blowing off steam."

17487,"If you find yourself preferring to manage tasks in sim style games rather than manage tasks in your RL - then you many not want to start this game because nothing in your RL will get done. Your children will starve, your house will be messy, you'll fail your classes, you'll get fired from work, etc ; )  Stardew Valley is about as addictive as it gets.

This game has the usual goal oriented farm tasks that you would expect like gardening, animal husbandry, crafting, house and land upgrading opportunities - but what sets SDV apart from some others of this ilk is the extended world beyond your farm.  There's extensive mining,  fishing, and monster hunting opportunities that will reap rewards that you can use to improve your SDV farm & life.  The SDV world is populated with towns folk for you to get to know and has many community activities for you to take part in.  Not only will towns folk send you on paid quests, but you have the opportunity to nurture relationships with them - even marry one of them and have a family of your own if you wish. 

The animation is charming and the interface is relatively simple and frustration free.  The tasks never become too repetitive as there is enough variety of things to do in this world, and this variety also allows the user to customize their approach to the game. Is the farm going to be your focus, or are you going to loose yourself in the depths of the mines, or are you going to become a bold monster hunting adventurer, or a master fisherman?  There are several different farm set ups to choose from and you'll have fun upgrading, improving and customizing your buildings and land.  Just don't forget to feed your kids - the RL ones, that is.

17501,"After playing this game for a little while, i have discovered that this game is much more than just a farming game."
17502,This is a good video game.
17503,The reason I like Stardew valley is because it's a great everyday game but the fish is a bit hard but it's nice when you catch a fish once in a while.
17504,"This Game is Amazing, i own it on 4 platforms"
17505,"So much fun with SOOOO much to do, overwhelming at first but amazing when you get settled. I've enjoyed every moment of this game so far. I've played three days straight just addicted to getting my farm how I want it, and with so many ways to live your life in this game its tough to figure out just exactly what I want to do. I'll have fun spending another 50 hours doing just that."
17506,I wish I could live a life like that 10/10
17507,"If there was ever a way to find inner peace, it's with Stardew Valley.  I would like to live inside this game."
17508,Very fun chill game something to do to get away from the competitiveness.

17516,woman can marry woman. 10/10
17517,"Stardew Valley is really fun to play, and personally it thought me many things that I was able to also implement in my everyday life and It's really fun to be able to play with friends now and be able to share ideas with them in our farm,"
17518,"Between Steam, Switch, PS, and that time I acquired it from a sketchy site, I have about 1000hrs in this masterpiece. One of the few games I took the time to achievement hunt on, and strangely one of the hardest ones to get 100%. 

Absolutely would recommend to anyone and can't wait for ConcernedApe's next game."
17519,My wife's favourite game. Pretty cool if you like'd the Harvest Moon games from GCN - Wii era

17548,"It's meant to be a game where you get away from the wretched grasps of capitalism and the modern dystopia that is the concrete jungle, but quickly evolves into you industrialising the quaint patch that your late grandfather left you into the backbone of entire town's economy."
17549,cat cute
17550,"Its perfect, the developer did everything right :D"

17565,I love my husband harvey
17566,"I bought this game as a gift for myself for completing my first year of university. The stress of the upcoming final exam though was a lot, so I decided i'd buy it early to just make myself chill out. Ended up spending all day on it, and the following morning, and was so addicted to it I was almost late to said exam which would of probably lead to me failing the year.

10 outta 10 would almost have to retake a years worth of uni for this game again"
17567,Love farming...!! I have a crippling addiction to playing this game in Multiplayer and it'll never be the same ever again I've never played as singleplayer ever again this game is 100% fantastic for multiplayer
17568,very nice
17569,good
17570,"stardew valley is one of the best games to play casually; its stress relieving and so much fun its definitely worth the money and even if you somehow get bored there are so many good mods, just the feeling that you've grown so much in a few stardew years if amazing."

17586,"Be careful. I avoided stardew for years thinking it seemed boring. I've had this game less than 36 hours, and I've lost half of those hours to this game. Bought it thinking it'd be a great game to play with the girlfriend, yeah that may be true, but even more so solo"

17596,good good game
17597,"I love this game, Its a very simple concept, grow a farm and make friends, but its so much more than just that.  you can play however you want, laid back and relaxed or hyper efficient, the game doesn't make you choose you can just play your way.  

Its the kind of game you keep coming back to when i get stressed. A visit to Pelican Town in stardew Valley always makes me feel better."

17627,"W game
"
17628,"Absolutely amazing and adorable !! I think this is definitely one of my favourite games ever. I haven't even gotten a 100% save file yet, but I still love everything the game has to offer. I mostly play on the Switch port, with upwards of 100 hours, which is why my steam account hours for this game are low. But trust me when I say, Stardew has gotten me through many tough times in my life and it means alot to me. I recommend this game to everyone, even people who don't often play video games. I'd go as far as to say that this is the perfect game for me, and alot of others."
17629,Just sell alcohol.
17630,"Stardew Valley is a great experience, this game really takes the cake for farming sims. Personable characters, rewarding progression, fun day to day tasks that don't feel like a chore. I need just one more achievement to say I truly finished this one to the full extent. The modding community can take the game and add so much more onto it as well, great community behind this one. The amount of love that went into this one is so evident when playing it, if you have not played the game yet I highly recommend you give this one a shot."
17631,yes i love it i lvoe chickanes
17632,Its good but confusing at first. But its very calming. Would recommend 100%
17633,stardew valley cured my depression
17634,"i love stardew valley!! this game is so relaxing and fun to play. it can be confusing in the beginning but once you get the hang of it you can never stop playing. farming, fishing, adventure, fighting, lore, this game has something for everyone. concernedape is constantly patching the game and releases free updates that are literally like whole DLCs.

17643,very fun
17644,Time IRL passes insanely fast when playing this game.
17645,"Been playing Stardew Valley for a good while on the PS4 port of the game. The console versions are absolutely phenomenal, but the PC copy takes this game to the next level. This game is fun as hell an a joy to play, especially if you download mods for it. Speaking of mods, they're very easy to install and add a shitload of extra content to the game, so pretty much anything you can think of there will be a mod for it.

Highly recommend for $15. Definitely worth it"
17646,Gatis is trying to sleep...
17647,"игра збс, пока играла с парнем чуть  не расстались из-за того, что он срубил мою яблоню, перепутав её с клёном"
17648,"After playing this game for about 400hrs on GOG (and losing my save) I can say that this is my go-to for a good dose of unhealthy escapism via a 7hr gaming marathon (which I do a lot). 

If you're in need of cozy, heartwarming, addictive and slighty anti-capitalist game to hyperfixate on and use as a totally healthy coping mechanism, try Stardew. If you're not still do it anyway :)

17664,Best farming sandbox game ever
17665,Throwback to when wildfires made it apocalyptic and literally dangerous to leave the house and this game was the only thing keeping me sane. I played it for an entire summer straight. Would recommend.
17666,farm
17667,"GOoD GaME!!!!
 some quality of life things could be addressed (such as certain terrain feature editing, and the horse being inconvenient half the time, and the inability to get certain items if they are ever lost) but they dont come up much if ever unless you play it a lot. all this can be fixed with mods if you wanna go through the trouble, since theres no steam workshop integration for them

I'm proud of concerned ape and hope their next game does well too!"
17668,very good very nice

17677,"good game. v calm, v chill."
17678,"This game is very unique, theres alot to be said about Stardew, but mostly it is one of those return to games that live in my heart.
Its a very easy (or more challenging) game dependent on how you approach things, however the game itself is very cute with its graphics, and the story lines, and indepth ability to hone on specific skills in game is amazing.
Theres no start or finish, just good soup.
I highly recommend anyone check this game out if they enjoy farming games, Or if they enjoyed Harvest moon. <3"
17679,"farm,mine,fish  and destroy the will of capitalist that tries to ruin the lives of the american poeple"
17680,It's Stardew.
17681,pretty good fishin is shit but other than that good game
17682,"I LOVE this game.  There are a good amount of tasks to do to keep busy, but it's still casual and can be done at a leisurely pace without consequences.  I love how the map keeps expanding as you play."
17683,"How much do I like this game? Yes.
Even when I don't play for a few months because I'm busy or focusing on other games and hobbies, I come back to this and go straight back into obsession. I'm not even good at it (like at all... I suck). But having a cute little farm with weirdly named animals? Don't talk to me or my twenty satanic chickens ever again, Stardew Valley is really good no matter if you're a pro aiming for all achievements or someone who just wants to enjoy what they can whilst tending to crops and feeding cows. 10/10 fleeing from reality points"
17684,it is very fun
17685,Sardew Valley is one of the most relaxing games I have played ever. It should be in every ones library.
17686,"This game is so relaxing and fun! As soon as I am almost complete with one farming location I immediately start a new one. It is a must play for all!! Even my little boy loves playing it helps with his autism and talking!
"
17687,"After Almost 100 hours on a single file, I must say that I could probably play this game for a thousand years"

17694,This game is so good that I'd feel bad buying it on sale.
17695,farm
17696,"This is the most wonderful game there is and I do not say that because this is a game which you can optimize into oblivion but because of the charming writing, the strong sense of progression and worth each day has and  a very easing aesthetic with a fitting rotation of background music.
The only complaints I could have is that the music isn't as strong as the music from Minecraft but it is palatable."

17718,fun very fun
17719,obviously duh
17720,"I look for Stardew Valley in every new game i want to play. 

*SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD*
Sandbox games get dull quite fast, even if there's a end goal you're working towards. In Minecraft, although the game technically ends when you defeat the dragon, the journey along the way is what most casual players enjoy the most, and that's where Stardew Valley shines. At the beginning, you are constantly frustrated at the fact that your energy and gold is too low to do anything productive, but somehow, every little bit of progress inches your further towards success. All of a sudden, you're in the midgame phase with around 10k profit every night, incubating void eggs to hatch cool chickens, and working to finish the community center. The game just feels very rewarding with every milestone you complete. It feels good that when you complete a difficult task, you're rewarded with a helpful item or sparkly sounds and a new star badge. I completed the 1000 slimes quest and was rewarded with the Slime Charmer ring, one of the most game changing rings for the Skull Cavern and combat in general. 

The small dev notes when you cheat are hilarious too. You want to glitch the game? Go ahead! Just know that CA is going to give you a snarky little message for abusing Clint's telephone line. Speaking of, ConcernedApe's story is amazing. Coming from someone who grew up on mobile and classic games such as Farmville, Penguin Diner, and Cooking Mama, this is the perfect implementation of nostalgia and modern gaming technology. There are videos up on his Youtube showcasing early previews of the game and it's just inspiring to see how he's reworked many of the games graphics and animations to what it is today. It's also just nice to see game devs interact with their community- CA hosted a Stardew Valley Cup not too long ago. I think the community surrounding the game is what caught me and kept me compelled. All the different metas creators have created and many people use in their games today and all the dedicated modders that work hard to build onto an already incredible base game.


At time of review, I only have 2 save files and one co-op save file that we abandoned in year one, but I truly just find a getaway in this game. There's just the right mix of RNG elements that makes the game alive. Waiting for lucky days to go out and do anything is another reason why I thiink I've lost so many hours to this game. The ""oh, I'll just do my mundane tasks until my Skull Cavern run,"" makes you get a lot done, imo. All in all, if you're seeking a slow-paced getaway game, Stardew Valley is for you. There are so many surprises and easter eggs that just cannot be covered in a Steam review, you just have to play it out! Worth every penny."
17721,fun relaxing game no matter the playstyle
17722,"Amazing game! I tend to get super interested in a new thing and then completely overplay it, resulting in me getting bored and then not playing it again. This game has been my favourite for 280 hours and I have yet to get tired of it. There is no end to the things you can do in this game, and no end to the kind of game you want it to be. You can be an achievement hunter, trying your best to get 100% perfection, or you can be a casual farmer, enjoying the relaxing atmosphere of Pelican town. You can try to earn as much money as possible, or you can take your time exploring the world. This game is truly well made and I look forward to spending an absolutely unholy amount of time playing it!"
17723,"This game is kind of like a more complicated, pixelated Animal Crossing. I love it."
17724,"is so sweet and i loose track of time playing

"
17725,"Stardew Valley is a great game. You start off with a farm, inherited by your Grandfather, and you get to work. There's tons of stuff to do, you can grow crops, go mining, forage for some cool stuff, and more! I love this game because you are free to do whatever you want, and have any relationship you desire with anyone (unless its marriage, there are only 12 candidates you can choose from to marry)! You can also go in co-op mode and play with your friends, just make sure you get home by 2:00am ;) (iykyk)"
17726,if u dont already have this game genuinely what r u doing
17727,"[b] Stardew Valley is a masterpiece, it filled the void Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town left behind as a kid. [/b] 

Everything from the great music and the interesting villagers to the fishing mechanics makes it a highly enjoyable experience. Stardew Valley has perfected the genre [i] (or has come very close to) [/i] of farm simulator role-playing games. Play it without going through any guides (the library has most of the answers you need), it makes the game even more rewarding."
17728,"I'd neglect my real life partner for Shane, if need be. 10/10"

17751,"One of my favorite games to relax and play. It's a game where there's almost too many things you can do, but it's well worth it. Highly recommend to anyone who has played any game similar to Animal Crossing as well. I haven't played it but I hear it's similar in play. I love all the stories and options so you can take the story where you want it to go."
17752,farm!
17753,I loved this game
17754,farming is fun
17755,"Farming AND romance? on MY computer? More likely than you'd think.
Best game I've ever played. 85% Sabastian simp, 9% Sam simp, 3% Abigail simp, 1% Harvey simp, 2% Robin simp"
17756,
17757,fun :D
17758,this game is obvi for the gays and we love it
17759,"I cry for anyone who has not yet experienced this masterpiece, that is all"
17760,"really relaxing, just don't make the basic sprinklers. Save for the upgraded  ones."
17761,W
17762,I LIKE THIS GAME A LOT IT HAS A FEW HOT CHARACTERS
17763,YES GOOD GAME :D
17764,"Not a fan personally, but i wont deter others from experiencing it for themselves"
17765,haley 4 life
17766,good
17767,"After me playing stardew valley every single day and after so many hours of me playing this wonderful game, I'm really glad that this game exists. It's calm, amazing and peaceful to play and it helps me a lot especially when I'm unhappy and want to play something nice.Stardew Valley will always be one of my most beloved favorite games"
17768,"Pros: I get to live out my twisted fantasy of being KFCs chicken supplier... the secret is the blue ones taste better...  Cons: I can't do the horizontal tango with krobus, nor can I raise what I can only assume would be the most adorable shadow monster/pixel person hybrid to ever exist. But I think concerned ape knows the world is not ready for such unrestricted power and is biding his time to give us this in his new game. For now the dream will solely live on in my big book of Stardew Valley x  Sonic Adventure 2 Battle rule 34 fanfic... But lets be serious for a second here guys #LetMeBangWilly"
17769,"this game is pretty good at combining potentially frustrating things like combat with potentially boring things like farming to make an overall varied and enjoyable experience. the fishing minigame sucks, though, just go ahead and download a mod that lets you skip it. four outta five stars overall from me"
17770,down bad
17771,"I've played Stardew Valley since the mobile launch in 2018. And no matter how much time passes, this game continues to be a masterpiece. Whether your playing by yourself, or your playing with your friends, you can count on Stardew Valley to be a beautiful and wholesome experience. To anyone who still hasn't played this game,  your missing out."
17772,"I played this game for two years and loved it then decided to pony up the money to get it on my mac, Now I love it even more."
17773,it good
17774,"Very fun, I would have liked to have known more about the game before I started, and since I like more action games this was definitely different but in a good way. I enjoy the mining aspect and that there is some form of fighting in this game. I have only scratched the surface but so far it seems like a very good game. Would highly recommend to anyone in their gaming journey."
17775,Great game
17776,i love being a gay little farmer and tending to my crops and marrying gay little villagers and petting my animals in the morning yes 11/10
17777,love this game
17778,Its just the best guys
17779,farm cool
17780,i like
17781,very good indeed
17782,"I recommend it quite highly. Once you've played it through normally once, I recommend trying modding! There's a healthy modding scene! Make sure to grow multiples of everything and put down a bit of path before the scarecrow. Have a nice time."
17783,Farm go brrrrrrr
17784,this is a cry for help. i have not left the house in two weeks because of this game. i am trapped.
17785,"The only bad thing about this game is how much it makes you want to quit your job, move out to west bumf*ck, and start life as a farmer and meet a charming townsperson your age and fall in love with them. The urge to drop everything in real life and live off the land is overwhelming and I have seriously considered the pros and cons of doing so.

I have never played a game that was so obviously made as a labor of love as Stardew Valley is. Not only is the game engaging, fun, and immersive, but it is also clean, polished, and visually pleasing. The story and mechanics are great, the activities are diverse and each one has a very simple ""skill tree"". I have put the SDV soundtrack onto my regular playlist because it is just that good. There is not a single aspect of this game that disappoints. If I could only purchase one game on Steam this would definitely be it.

17795,Addicting af
17796,"I'm not sure that a review can honestly explain the love I have for this game. I have played nearly 150 hours on PC, and twice that on my switch. This game is so full of things to do that I've never truly been bored. I find I come back to this game more often than any other game I have played since high school. I always loved harvest moon growing up, and I feel Stardew has expanded and grown far beyond anything that harvest moon ever did. I can easily say that in my nearly 20 years of playing video games, this one is by far my favorite. I can not wait to see what ConcernedApe does next! :)"

17854,Stardew valley is really fun and relaxed so I would recommend it if you have the time to
17855,Farm
17856,fun
17857,This is one of my favorite games of all time and honestly i would recommend this game to literally everyone especially my fellow cottagecore lesbians
17858,One of my absolute favorite games. It's got lots of things to do and work towards and he still patches and updates the game from time to time. Concerned Ape made a really great game with this one. I know lots of other games that cost more and don't have half the content that this game has. I've played weeks worth of time on this game and I still have't completed everything and still find new secrets all the time.
17859,Best game ever
17860,"Positive relaxing game, still with plenty of challenge for a senior : )"
17861,"Woman acquired

New terraria update looking kinda wack..."
17862,why wont it open!!!!!
17863,This is an amazing game and i have had a lot of fun and amazing times with this game
17864,good soup
17865,Great to play with friends who are far away
17866,farm
17867,"At first I didn´t think I would like this game, but I bought it on mobile first and it hooked me up. Later I discovered (through SV streamers) about Ginger Island and that it´s not on mobile yet (take your time Concerned Ape), I said fusk it and bought it on pc. Best purchase ever. This game is calm and ineterstng. The lore and all the character developments are so good! It´s game that can be enjoyed by different generations and I love this aspect of it!"
17868,very fun game. I have this game on switch before i got it on steam. So good
17869,"I can't remember how many times I had to drop this game and tried to give it a chance. The game is too 'grindy' and it's not even worth the grind. I had to to make several new playthrough just to see it in a different approach, or different strategy or perhaps I might have been playing it wrong.
Not sure what the hype was all about. But I guess it's just not for me.
Oh yeah and the NPCs are boring."
17870,Pretty sweet tbh. Harvey best romance
17871,love this game!
17872,"Love this. additcted, so calming, 10/10"

17879,yes !
17880,"This game is great! The characters are interesting, the gameplay is calm, only downside is that it promises you a lovable adventure frolicking through aforementioned Stardew Valley before you eventually become the next Walter White trying to produce and sell your goods."
17881,sigma game
17882,"12/10

17883,Good Game

17891,10/10
17892,yeah
17893,"why can't i marry jodi, i can provide more than kent can, screw him"
17894,"This game is so fun and cute too. It dose feel hard in the beginning but once you get the hang of it the game actually becomes pretty easy to play. I definitely recommend playing with others aswell makes the game so much more fun working as a team and helping each other out, plus it makes the gameplay so much easier than playing alone."
17895,"Honestly one of the best, most wholesome and mildly addictive games out there. Ape killed it."
17896,is pretty good
17897,Too easy to fall into spending hours farming :)
17898,very clam and nice the story is very interesting
17899,i rate this game grandpa's bed out of 10
17900,gay
17901,Just play it
17902,"I started out playing on my ipad and have since migrated to the pc version and was flooded with new stuff that ive never seen when playing on ipad. Great game, by far one of my favorites!"

17904,"very good
"
17905,yes
17906,very noice
17907,its fun
17908,"Stardew Valley is a very good game to play when you are bored, it is the best singleplayer game  and finaly its old but gold!"
17909,This game is very good it has a story line fighting and farming you can do all sorts of stuff in this game.
17910,Amazing game
17911,Game is fun and has lots of depth. However movement speed early game can be painful.
17912," Ah Haley Üzümlü  Kekim  :)
Alex'in ***"
17913,"Such a relaxing game, really helps to calm me at the end of a stressing day"
17914,i have never obsessed over a game like this 10/10
17915,lovelovelove
17916,Great game! Highly recommend mods if you already know what the game is like to play. Otherwise the base game is frequently updated and tons of fun! So support your local indie dev!
17917,optimizing production and getting a huge payout of cash each week is like crack
17918,"fun cute and actually quite deep and expansive. very repetitive at first and super grindy if you dont know what you are doing. but if you dont mind a bumbling grind for the first few playthroughs, you will get there. Also if you dont care about getting the ""best ending"" fast you can take your time with everything. the best ending needs a super complicated main objective completed with in a set limit. but there is so much to this game, that just putting the hrs in on a save you dont care about semi ""speed running"" on you will learn all you need. I still havent gotten the good ending, but i play infrequently, but i will do it this time, i will reach the awesome end game shit, then maybe go back replay it and get the good ending. 

long story short, if you have 100+ hrs to learn the game, you will then have 5hrs to do it. lots of fun, what is that missing dialog? one day ill get there."
17919,10/10 would recommend. its a little slow at the start but then... wow do you get into it. addictive as heck. and actually kinda deep at times. so worth it.
17920,A slow paced but nice game to play.
17921,Nice relaxing game. Fun either solo or with friends
17922,i get so many wome n its a good game perfext
17923,goooooooodddddddddddddddddd
17924,"Ah hello friend, so good of you to drop by. Pull up a chair and enjoy this warm cup of green tea. The harvest is good this year and the spirits are happy."
17925,It is currently 2 in the morning and i spent all of tonight playing this game. 10/10
17926,Great game the BEST zone out game in my opinion while base game has enough to do for hundreds of hours I highly recommend modding through smapi for an even better experience base game id give it 10/10 modded id give it 11/10
17927,stardew valley gud
17928,"A very calming and joyful game, its surprising that it was made by just one person due to the quality of everything and how much my friends and I have gotten out of it. Its was wonderful to play with my girlfriend when we were unable to go over to each others houses...and now my fiancee and I play from across our desk.
I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a good time on a cute farm in a quaint little town."
17929,love this game
17930,10/10 game

Wanna live the simple life and become the most successful farmer in the valley? 
Wanna create an aquarium full of legendary fish? 
Wanna raise a slime army to attack the town?

17980,It is a really fun but laid back game.
17981,like it
17982,8/10. Would have been a 10/10 if I had the ability to change my children into birds using witchcraft.
17983,"Uma belo remake do jogo Harvest Moon, só que bizarramente melhorado e mais divertido"
17984,best game
17985,Great for passing time... Better with a friend or friends. Definitely worth the purchase in my opinion.
17986,good game
17987,wholesome farming experience
17988,It's aight
17989,Good game after a long day at work when you are looking to relax. i usually play it in windowed mode and have a TV show going on the side. recommend for anybody.
17990,BEST GAME EVER I LOVE IT SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH YOU SHOULD PLAY IT
17991,"This is such an amazing game! I've enjoyed playing it alone and with friends and it's so relaxing! This is my happy place after a stressful day!

You do what you want and you can work at your own pace. I love varying between farming more seriously and regularly or skipping a farming season to focus on mines or quests or fishing. I now have 2 junimo huts, which makes this much easier and I can still have some income because the junimos will cultivate the crop for me. 
I've also enjoyed building friendships with villagers and seeing the cut scenes with silly or sad stories. But if stories aren't your style, you can always skip them. 

It's a game filled with quests, puzzles (especially on ginger island), and so many different activities including crafting, farming, cooking, fighting, fishing, mining, gathering resources, foraging, etc.  I'm very much enjoying trying to achieve complete perfection on the farm, which is the big, main goal of the game. (if you feel like doing it)

I can't wait for Haunted Chocolatier from the same creator to come out!"
17992,Wholesome and funny game to play by yourself or with friends. Having company imo is more entertaining. Teamwork really pays off. I completely recommend this game. Also be nice to Shane :(
17993,I love this game; so fun to play long distance with my dad and my sister. :)

18002,"This game is an all-time favorite of mine! For $15 you get literally endless gameplay because there are so many different ways to play and paths to take. You can use this game as a cozy farm simulator or you can fully immerse yourself in the rich lore and quests of the game. I have many saves, and they are all completely different! Could not recommend this game more."

18047,I love the game! I always loved playing farming games since I was a child and after playing stardew for many years its still enjoyable. i would 100% recommend the game to anyone wanting a relaxing time on a farm
18048,probably the best game that i ever played
18049,"Great game, all of these years later still the best farm sim out there"

18054,I LOVE THIS GAME V FUN TO PLAY 10/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18055,"great game nice and relaxing. If you want to play a game that is pretty chill and doesn't require a lot of focus and rather upbeat i recommend Stardew Valley. With its cute characters to its fun farming, mining, and dialogue you'll find yourself having a blast while playing this game."
18056,"chill, love it."
18057,"Stardew Valley sure is a peacefull expierence... I did not finish the game, since I burned out, but I really want to come back to it. The art style is great, the gameplay mechanics are really polish and the charcaters are incredible and one of the game's greatest aspect. The music is also really good, I found myself humming at some of the game's songs. Again, I couldn't finish the game, I didn't even advance that much in the ""story"" because I was too focused on playing at my pace, completing the things I myself choosed to do, and I believe that is the best aspect of the game, that no mater what it gives you as a mission you can choose to ignore it and play however you want and as fast or slow as you want to, and I believe that playing at your own pace is the best way of playing this game. 
9/10 great game, really looking forward on getting interested in playing it again."

18065,Best farming sim to divorce your husband/wife to.
18066,"Stardew Valley is such a relaxing game, from chatting with the NPCs or planting your own parsnip garden. Even the mines, which can be somewhat stressful to conquer, are enjoyable and present a good time for anyone who plays. The seasons in-game give it a wonderful dynamic, and I can't help but get attached to all the characters, even the ones I don't like. The dialogue is often witty and the characters are all unique, with special traits that make them who they are. With hundreds of recipes, you'll never get bored making new meals, and finding secret missions and items, the game never loses your attention. There's always new challenges and items to find, or just new dialogue to see."

All the characters are unique and interesting. You have lots of creative freedom. There's so much content to unlock and many many quests. It's almost impossible to get bored!"
18080,Absolutely adore this game. There is so much content and I'm always finding new things to do! Had to grab it on my PC so I can have completed it here as well as on my xbox!

18106,"Honestly, I dont like the game at all. But thats a personal thing. When I was younger, this type of game was one of my favorite genres. Today, I am older, I changed as every human changes over time. So, it's wasted money for me.

Why the positive review? This game seems to be good. It works flawless from a technical standpoint and many people really love it, so if you like the ""farming/social"" types of games, here you go, buy it. Its worth it."

There's so much content and things to learn, the community is so sweet, the characters are adorable, the gameplay is fun, its hard to get bored of it. It sucks you in and, at least in my experience, you end up playing it for hours upon hours and it only feels like its been 30 minutes. It is very relaxing and a great way to unwind. The fact that this game was made by one dude? Astonishing. If you're wondering if you should get it or not the answer is yes, without a doubt you should."

18188,"This is the best game I have ever played. So wholesome, relaxing, and real. Managing a farm is absolutely satisfying. The changes to the seasons make it more interesting and refreshing making every season feel new. The townspeople are way more than meets the eye and all have a story to them. Some of their stories will bring you joy while others will make you sad. You essentially become a huge part of their lives and bring about significant change. What a beautiful game!!!!! I can't wait until the developer releases The Haunted Chocolatier."

It's very easy to lose time while playing Stardew Valley between building up your farm, the community center, relationships with the npcs, and exploring the world. It's also a treat and a joy that there are so many mods that help to enhance to experience of the game or even make it feel like you're playing the game for the first time all over again. I can say with 100% certainty that this is not a game I will ever get sick of playing, and I will always recommend this game to anyone that enjoys games within the same genre.

18260,"Very fun farming/community game.
Multiplayer does not work for my self. 
7/10

18261,very cute and chill game
18262,tomo
18263,2nd best chill game
18264,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmusic
18265,"I found it really fun, but very time consuming. If you're gonna play it, make sure you have time."
18266,"After 6.9 Hours, its SUPER fun, just need some patience."
18267,"At the time of this review I'm currently at 137 hours in this game. Even though I have spent so much time in this virtual farming simulator, I feel that I have yet to scratch the actual surface of this game. There's so much more for me to explore and plenty of villagers for me to befriend still. I get caught up in the farming and money generating that I spend hours watching the money go up and down with the new seasons. 

12/10 game. Highly recommended for a more relaxing experience."
18268,masterpiece
18269,"A Charming little farm game. Moves a little slow, but that is kind of the point and alot of fun"
18270,Always play this game when I wanna de-stress and relax. Very calm chill game to just play in the background of anything else you might be doing
18271,10/10 would marry shane's toxic a$$ again

18277,w
18278,One of the best games I've ever played
18279,"I got back into this game once I got my Steam Deck, and I gotta say, it's the perfect game to play away from the computer. While fun to play with a mouse and keyboard, being able to game on my couch makes it even better.

The game itself is both addicting and forgiving. I find myself thinking of how I can optimize my farm while I'm at work.

10/10"
18280,Best game for relaxing and creativity.
18281,Is Nice
18282,i like 2 farm
18283,I have fucking dacha. But this game is fine
18284,"Farm crops, get laid, delve into dungeons... Live life."
18285,"cute game, slightly addicting. Has a cute cat. <3"
18286,"Absolute banger of a game- so much content and even if you want more mods are so easily accessible. 
You're not forced into just farming, which was something I wasn't aware of prior to getting the game, I spend my days in the mines! This game has so much character to offer and has raised my standards and understanding about what 2d life sims can offer. 
My favourite game to play after I've finished work, however is a rather rude awakening as it's a stark contrast to my actual life :DDDDDD"
18287,Lovely Game
18288,"Love this game 
I have it on my phone, playstation, macbook and nintendo switch
Its just so much fun"

18295,lets you hyperfixate on fishing. good game
18296,"I Love this game. I've played this game more than any other steam game, even with my 405 hours on this game I've never beaten it that's just how much content is in it. This is 100% THE best farming simulator ever no doubt in my mind."
18297,"very calm and chill game, fun to play"
18298,good

18309,"According to Steam, I've played this game for only nine hours so far, and already I'm in love! Stardew Valley combines some of the best elements from my favorite games, which I will not name here for the sake of the developers. (as a creator I know how hard having your work compared to other peoples can be) I love the melding of classic RPG mechanics like combat and spelunking with a calming farming aspect, as well as amazing character designs and dialogue between the characters. The energy and schedule mechanics are also a great way to keep the pace up, and it can be really stressful (in a good way) when you're 10 layers deep in the mines and realize you have 1 in-game hour until your character passes out then and there. I'm always kept on my toes in there!"
18310,god i love this game           give me corn
18311,amazeballs best game ever tbh

There is so much content and even if you get bored of that... the modding community has your back. I love the NPCs, story and the art style very much. Leah or Penny are definitely my favorite NPCs to marry."
18319,"i never close the game so i can open it back up wherever i leave off and my discord status said i had been playing it for 10 days and my friend dmed me a screenshot of my profile and the message ""i know you have depression but i didn't know it was getting this bad. you can always talk to me if you want"

18334,Fun and enjoyable experience overall
18335,Its cool I guess
18336,fun

DROP THAT BABY AND GET IN GAME BABY, EZ, DO IT."
18347,"Incredible game. The characters are 3 dimensional (not literally), the mechanics are very well executed. The farming is relaxing, and the mining is terrifying. Also all the bachelor(ette)s are so well written that you will play again and again, just to marry them all."
18348,pog
18349,I don't see what the hype is about. Extremely boring.
18350,"this game sucks so fucking badly, fishing fucking sucks the fish is like stroking a dick and sucking it goes up and down up and down and doesnt even fucking stop the mine also sucks the monsters do at least 1000 damage per fucking hit like why do you do so much and the only damn armor are some fucking boots and they just somehow protect me like add some fucking armor so i dont get raped and dont even get me started on the fucking desert mine holy shit  that mine is actual fucking hell i guess they should rename it dont even get me started on the carnival as well its always green until i need to win one more time ""i feel a orange positive energy"" kys fresh the only thing i enjoy is sitting outside waiting for the person i love and sit there for 3 hours jsut so i can give a gift and get 4 hearts before the fucking flower dance so i can dance with her and shane is a piece of shit and goes to work 9-5 just to get paid 50 cents per fucking year and goes to the bar jsut to drink the pain away what pain? how fucking lonely and fucking depressed you are you are mroe depressed then fucking sebastion and he lives in a fucking basment."

18356,love love love
18357,it is soo funn!!!
18358,"If you like grinding and long games, this is right up your alley! I started enjoying it all the way up to the end game, but then it became a lot slower and more about grinding than anything else (especially as someone who likes to 100% games). However though, I don't regret getting this game, as I can play it with my friends and it has a good bit of customization to it! 

One downside though is that I wish we had a catalog for which dyes made which clothes once we've made them!"
18359,.
18360,i learn how to garden irl because of this
18361,"in my own honest opinion, every person should at least try this game"
18362,e
18363,I spend many hours a week playing this game both with friends and by myself. I have well over 300 hours on my switch and nearly 150 hours (so far!) on PC! Well worth the few bucks to get! I recommend it to anyone who will listen!

18419,"Great game. Lots to do and customise, so many things to do (such as community centre, ginger island, pefection). Love every aspect of the game. I would describe it as somewhat similar to animal crossing in the farm decoration and NPC aspect, and somewhat similar to minecraft/terraria due to aspects such as crafting, combat and even the graphics. Overall very fun game and v relaxing."

18460,"you should totally buy this game. but why is the summer song ""the sun can bend an orange sky"" so unpopular on spotify. like. have you heard the spring music?? there's too much banjo going on there. i hate that nobody has the same opinions as me and im really lonely. i miss my dad."
18461,farm much. big farm
18462,gifted by a friend of mine. this game is so cozy i love it
18463,good game BUT HEED MY WARNING YOU MAY CRAVE THIS GAME AND NOT BE HAPPY WITH OUT IT
18464,"Great game, if this game was an actual living person, I would marry this person and buy them cookies and ice cream. They can step on me too if they want. Music makes you feel at ease, the characters are also great, makes you feel like you're a part of a loving community. You can also marry someone in this game, very suitable for those who can't find love in real life and must resort to games to satisfy their love life. The mods keep the game fresh, not too repetitive. 9/10, would play again."
18465,"yes
"
18466,"its a great game,"
18467,Fun
18468,One of the most relaxing game to play
18469,"Gift an NPC a raw fish that was kept outside in a wooden box for 3 years and he be like ""THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED! THANK YOU!"".
Jokes aside, the game is great. Just rememebr to be back in bed before 2 AM, or else you'll be out of some money."
18470,"fun, relaxing, outlet"
18471,i like this game but i really hate that the hours are 43 seconds and that teleporting is a late game feature because time goes by too fast and it is wasted by the incredibly slow movement speed. this makes me feel stressed because there is so much to do but not enough time in a day to experience it
18472,"I love this game!!!, played over 100 hours on my switch and decided to get it on steam!"
18473,nice.
18474,krobus
18475,Its a fun game with friends and is very calming
18476,Really fun and relaxing
18477,"I like that there's so many different things to do, but not overwhelmingly so."
18478,"addicted to such a cute game, always something to do"
18479,"Addicting, stole my girlfriend from me, stay away."
18480,"Chill, good to relax to"
18481,it is very pog.
18482,"At over 1800 hours in less than a year and a half of finding this game, I think we can clearly tell how much I love this game. This is my comfort game. My come home and decompress from a stressful job and the every day trudge of living every day with depression and anxiety. This makes all of that melt away for a while and you get to enjoy the simple things in life, even if it's just a simulated version of a simpler life. 

This video game is one for all ages too! My family and I live an ocean away from one another. I find it difficult to keep in contact and reaming consistent in people's lives. This game helped with that a lot! Now my mom (50's) and I (30's) make it a habit to spend a few hours most weekends playing Stardew Valley, sometimes my sister and her husband (20's) both play along as well! 

I know this is a long post, and it might seem like a really over dramatic thing to say, but I found this game when I was in a really dark place. I struggled to reach out and have a simple conversation with anyone, even people who I consider my inner circle. We were in the middle of a pandemic and everything looked so bleak. Now while Stardew Valley didn't fix the pandemic, or magically solve my mental health issues, it most certainly helped me cope, and it allowed me to forget about everything else, if only for a few hours. 

I cannot recommend this game enough. It will leave you with lots of fun gameplay that is equal parts challenging and relaxing."
18483,This game has helped me manage through the hardest times in my life. This is one of my favorite games
18484,"I rate Stardew Valley a 50 out of 10. And I know that's not possible, but that's how much I enjoy it!
It's worth every penny and has so much to offer, 
Role play, Romance, Building wealth, Resource management, Comedy, 50/10 ;)

18487,Leah's a baddie
18488,"Love this farming sim, a rich amount of content included in the game. Somewhat stressful as each day nears its end and I haven't ticked off everything I wanted to, but it's a nice stress.
My feel-good go-to when I want to feel a sense of accomplishment in daily in-game tasks."
18489,10/10 best farming game
18490,"Do you want to chill out and farm, forage, fish, mine, and fight monsters to get your character (and yourself) away from the daily work grind?

Stardew Valley is for you."
18491,great game
18492,game make big fun me
18493,"A great game to play on your own or with friends. Although I can't say I'm great at the game, it has its charms and has certainly become one of my favorites."

10/10"
18502,chiken :)
18503,"If this game doesn't make you happy or at least calm, i'm not sure what will. Incredible game, very good."
18504,What a lovely little game! What an experience to take a farm from nothing to selling multiple thousands of wine. The quirks of the villagers really set it apart from other farming simulators and make it such a fun experience!
18505,I have this game on almost every console we own. Amazing game super comfy
18506,women fear me fish fear me
18507,Very good relaxing game to play.
18508,slayed
18509,Add a divorce arc for Caroline.... and make her mine........

18511,"It's a nice game. It takes a while to learn all of the capabilities as a player, but it's very rewarding and can be very calming."
18512,"after one thousand hours
i decided it was time
to honor my favorite game
with a review disguised in rhyme

stardew valley is the best
you should give it a try
like a warm cozy blanket
or home baked apple pie

relaxation at it's finest
a quiet life on the farm
baby animals bring smiles
a lovely garden adds some charm

if adventure is your thing
there are monsters in the mine
or travel to a far off land
either one is totally fine

for those who feel more social
the town is chatty and populated
pick up a cutie at the saloon
maybe a wedding will be fated

you should definitely check it out
whether with some friends or alone
either way you can't go wrong
also, thank you mr. barone"
18513,best game waste my life in farmer land my heart is full and my crops are bountiful
18514,"It is a relaxing game, either you can play in a grindish way, or just hold back and play really passive. Either way you will experience a nice game play with meaningful characters and a extraordinary story about a man or woman and a farm."
18515,"played this games many times, never gets old imo"
18516,I enjoy.
18517,"Game is swag, what can I say."
18518,muito do bão
18519,farm
18520,"Fun, wholesome game, good for distracting yourself for 15 minutes or playing for hours on end, tones of secrets to explore too!"
18521,I am a real therapist and I think this game is great.
18522,beans
18523,yes
18524,I didn't think I'd like this game. I tried it as a way to pass the time. It's actually quite enjoyable. I really like going into the dungeons for mining and fighting monsters.
18525,this is amazing.
18526,"very fun if you are into farming games, also has some pretty good lore if you go down that road. overall a very good game and definitely a worthy purchase."
18527,ITS AMAZING!!!
18528,soooo good
18529,"Steam says ""Would you recommend this game?""...I mean...I've played 218 hours at this point, and I keep going back for more. Yes, I would recommend this game! Addictive, fun, and an impressive piece of work by one developer. It's way more than farming, there is a whole story and community here."
18530,Let me marry Krobus please thanks :3
18531,"This game has a funny way of splitting the player base into two definitive factions: those who embrace Harvey's mustache in all of its glory and those who mod it away. 

The side you choose defines who you are forever."
18532,"I love this game! Amazing replayability, and love playing with my boyfriend and friends!"
18533,"fun game, calm and interesting."
18534,"stardew is a super packed game. There is no real reason to get bored, and there is a lot to complete."
18535,i fished
18536,Good game to turn your brain off with.
18537,Ver goo gam

18542,Good
18543,This has been one of my new game addictions!!! I love it very much and its a very fun game
18544,i am very bad at reviews but one is necessary for me to recommend the game so here it is i rec this game.
18545,"Generally a very great game, and ConcernedApe has done a wonderful job dealing with fanbase feedback. See all videos on SV on YouTube- especially DangerouslyFunny's older ones."
18546,"I like this game cuz meth and robux/bobux
"
18547,"I Hate Linus with every fabric of my being. This all started when I was playing on my switch with my close buddy and I couldn't skip the cutscene. This ended in us losing 202g from not being able to get to bed. Since then, I put his fire out every winter, I use every explosive on his tent, every piece of ammo I use on him. Whenever I am able to get his black berry basket, I keep it for myself. My only wish is for him to suffer eternally. I pray every single night to god wishing there was a way to get negative hearts or to kill npcs, please someone ask or contact ConcernedApe because I cannot live knowing this man also lives. I sleep 2 hours a night, the rest is devoted to thinking of new plans to get back at Linus. He has uprooted my entire life. I have devoted hours of my life just to show this man how much I despise him. The only reason I don't have a perfect save file is because of my grudge against him. Other than that, great game! 10/10!"
18548,"The game has lots of charm and great moments,most charters are not that good but its something i would look past"
18549,It's great.
18550,is good
18551,FARM GOOD
18552,good game!
18553,Very bad at this game. It's really fun though to grow crops get new animals and have your money pile up.
18554,I like all the events in Stardew and I hope developer release more and more events! The Mermaid event was the most memorable one for me! Very heart-warming and peaceful calming game! I like it!
18555,"This is a fun farming game with so much stuff you can do, dont believe me? well heres a list of stuff to do

Farm
Mine
Fish
Get friends
Get married
Complete Bundles (Basically just item hunts you need to get diffrent items)
And so much more

Also theres really no goal so just have fun and try not rush!"
18556,is epikk
18557,Good
18558,this game is stinky but only if you love STINK!
18559,"Good game, fishing is hard for me, but I like the game.

Edit (8/6/2022)
Fishing WAS hard for me. I just caught my first sea cucumber, and have now caught a total of four sea cucumbers. It really is true what they say ""git gud"". Thank you stardew for teaching me the true meaning of those words."
18560,vegetable
18561,"Joja sucks; Morris = trash

If you play, youll see"
18562,good soup!!!

18565,"Warm, cozy, relaxing, simple, and peaceful. What more could you want? 

Great game with great mechanics, graphics, and an exceptional atmosphere. It’s so easy to get lost just doing something as small as fishing. 100% worth it"
18566,Sam>>
18567,Amazing game with a great modding community
18568,absolutely love this game could play for hours with no break. highly recommended
18569,TinK tInK hehehehe

18575,"Good,"
18576,"it's just one of those games that you pick up every once in a while, then drop it again after a few hours"
18577,so so great

18581,Its fun
18582,Awesome 10/10
18583,"its a peacful game, and honestly is one of my comfort games.
"
18584,A good game to chill 10/10
18585,"As a very big fan of simulation games- especially cute ones like this, I was absolutely taken aback by the amount of content this game has. When I first got it, I was on my iPhone and didn't really know much about the game. From that point on, I explored the game more and more. There are things for everyone to do- including fishing, mining, and working towards the community center. You can play with friends, or by yourself. The community center really helps with working as a team and working to reach a goal. 

This game gives a really relaxing and therapeutic vibe, leaving endless opportunities for play styles. You can go slow and enjoy the game for what it is- or you can try to speed run and add a certain area of challenge to the game. I have Stardew Valley on every console I have. Pc, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and Ios. I have replayed it hundreds of times, and have never gotten bored. Not to mention that the developer is incredibly kind and we all admire him for doing what he did with this beautiful game. To have this all for 15 dollars is a steal- and I would have to highly recommend it."
18586,It's very calming and I plan to get back into it this year.
18587,:=)
18588,"this game ruled my life for a solid two years at least and i can feel it sucking it me back in, it's SO GOOD"
18589,"me no like fishing
fish bad"
18590,"very nice game. Lovely character and storyline, many way to make money"
18591,"Honestly, one of the best games I have ever played. I can't believe I let it sit in my backlog for such a long time"
18592,"Great game, it just doesn't load in rn but it's really fun and peaceful of a game."
18593,tissit
18594,"sam is so lazy
update;
i left sam for sebastian"
18595,"Stardew Valley is one of the most story and environment rich games I have ever played. You can make your own farm, meet tons of wonderful and intriguing characters, battle your way to precious ores in the mines, and make as many friends as you can. It also has an interest for those who like to maximize efficiency, since the Sprinklers will automatically water your farm for you.

10/10, would recommend to everyone"
18596,love this game! <3
18597,jess grape
18598,Sehr gut!
18599,"By far one of my favorite games. There is so much to do, so many different ways to do it. The characters are fun to love, but some are also fun to hate. It's a good game to play whether you want to spend hours mindlessly playing something for fun, or spend time focusing strongly on stuff for a while. I have a few copies of this on different platforms, so this is just the hours spent on PC... I have way more on Switch. Lol

If you liked the Harvest Moon games, give this a shot! Really!

PS: Put the shorts in the soup. Just do it."

18603,It's nice
18604,One of the best games on Steam
18605,"By far one of the best games I have played. Most games usually I play for a bit then lose intrest, but this game is just so nice that I don't want to stop playing."
18606,just awesome and cute. Be careful not to go to the mines too late though
18607,Supurb game with a good replayability and wholesome vibes through-out.
18608,ewAWD
18609,Great Game
18610,its such a good game
18611,Three words: It's a bargain.
18612,my friend told me i can kiss sam in this game and now it's my life purpose to marry him
18613,"unlike real life, my wife didn't leave me"
18614,VERY COOL CAT
18615,"I don't have many games that I am nostalgic about, but this is on the top of that list.
I remember loading it up for the first time and how it refused to load because it needed to be connected to speakers for it to work. I also remember the relief and excitement when I was able to get it to work.
The joy I experienced with every new discovery, and how angry I got at myself for using cheats before completing everything on my own. But even still, years later, I always end up coming back to Stardew Valley."
18616,"I enjoy this game immensely, in no small part due to the sheer variety of things to do.  There are multiple play styles available due to the skill tree. I'm also impressed that one person continues to make updates and additional content for this game. It's a beautiful thing to see."
18617,Played this game while I was watching Heard vs Depp trial. Got pretty addicted. 10/10.
18618,Good game with an amazing developer
18619,helpful for when you feel like jumping into oncoming traffic
18620,I love being able to boot up such a relaxing and visually pleasing game after a long day
18621,nice
18622,"ITS COOl

"
18623,good
18624,gud geym
18625,awesome relaxing and deep game. never nothing to do.
18626,"One of the best games I've ever played, and one that's taken many hours of my time, don't regret it a bit though.
I enjoy this game so much I play it on PC, PS4, and Switch, I don't do that with any other game, it's just got so much content, I can fall in love with the game just by choosing to follow different roads from previous play troughs.  I think I've played close to 300 hours on switch too, and a bit less on PS4. I still amen't bored.
Which is amazing after years of playing, probably the best value purchases I've made on steam.
Helped by the fact that the dev added in a hell of a lot of additional content long after the game had shipped, adding even more diversity to each play through. 
A nice game for co-op multiplayer too, it's enjoyable to guide a new player through, and once they're fluent in stardew, its great to watch the farm grow, to go to events together, and hey! you can even marry your co-op partner! how many games can say that? Or that it let's you have the sweetest monster roommate in the world? and I do have to give it points for having 8 romantic options, which include men or women and anyone can marry any of them.
It's as good as any harvest moon game I've played, and much better than any modern game in the series, yet it has its own heart and own identity to me.
If you're into the harvest moon farm sim genre, in my opinion, you cannot do better than Stardew Valley when it comes to bang for your buck.
"
18627,"Great fun, and causes you to think about what you are going to do withe each day, like fishing or mining."
18628,yesir
18629,This is a great game i really enjoy playing it with my friends.
18630,Yes.
18631,the game is fun but it keeps on failing to sync wth and it keeps kicking me out
18632,"wet the plant ,and when rain go to mine to chop stone"
18633,good game a lot of fun
18634,yes
18635,"Love the game overall, despise fishing minigame more than anything. I wish there was a non-mod option to skip it for others like me"
18636,LIKE THIS GAME!
18637,Farm
18638,good
18639,"im gay, and this game made me feel accepted"
18640,fishing. all I need to say
18641,The game won't load.

18645,Dew
18646,uts good
18647,The only place I will willingly do my chores and daily responsibilities.
18648,Don't buy this game if you want to stay sane. 10/10
18649,"Just as addictive as Harvest moon games. Recommend to anyone who liked the old Game boy classics. Except in this game, there is more than just farming."
18650,i absolutely adore this game. there is so much to do which makes it so it never gets boring. i also love how there is no rush and u can play at your own pace. 100% recommend.
18651,its an amazing game
18652,"Wholesome, elements of Magical Realism, but can be stressful if you're a first timer and worried about losing all your crops in winter (like i did)

My advice; relax, worry not. you'll get through it, you wont miss out on stuff probably, and you can keep farming come spring."
18653,What they said.
18654,SEBBY I LOVE YOU
18655,Now I can ignore social interactions in a video game as well.
18656,Great change of pace from fps games
18657,sexy kids
18658,best game ever
18659,"Simply put if you like farming blue fruits, star fruits, and orange gem fruits after the first year of your playthrough, Buy this game."
18660,Yeah it's pretty fun
18661,Cures depression
18662,good game
18663,Great and relaxing game :)
18664,Defiantly a game that i keep coming back to. There is so much replaybility when you play with mods or not. Even playing with friends the gameplay can be different.
18665,"I have so many memories of the different farms me and my friends have spent countless hours on, and I would do it all again. More than well worth $15"
18666,pretty fun game
18667,"Its Lit and you can make crops. This is due to the sun allowing the crops to undergo photosynthesis. This is done by a water molecule being broken by a photon of light, creating oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons. The Oxygen is release and recycled while the hydrogen is charged by the electron on the ETS, allowing for energy to be used by the cells. This is an amazing process due to the ingame need of watering your crops and not just being able to breath on them. CO2 isn't used in the process of a plants energy until later on, meaning that daily watering of the crops is necessary. 

Other than that you can drink beer."
18668,"game good, we love to see it, gonna 100% this game"
18669,"I played a tiny bit, I got some parsnips pretty good overall"
18670,Utterly worthless. No way to install or run the game.
18671,"very entertaining, cute graphics. i will say, starting off is a little challenging as there is little instruction from the start. but overall, fun!"
18672,"Pokemon style art = who can't love it?
Customizable sandbox = who can't love it?
RPG ( a classic one at that) = who can't love it?
Multiple playthrough options = who can't love it?
Answer to all = People who hate fun games."
18673,The power.... The power and urge TO FISH
18674,Cum Farm
18675,"Very fun, am addicted, would recommend if you have nothing better to do with your life"
18676,its such a light game with such a lovely story
18677,It's not bad
18678,"Great game, one of may favorites, I recommend to everyone. Veteran gamer, modder, or vanilla newbie, it's a great game and I think you aught to buy it. Cute graphics, low demand game, large availability of mods, and simple theme. Extremely fun, every time I play."
18679,Googe gam ahaha
18680,VERY GOOD
18681,"Bought it in a bout of impulse hyperfixation; It has been more or less four days and I've made it to year two. I've been clinically diagnosed with a few things, but my OCD is probably the main contributor to why this game sits so well with me. This game is the perfect outlet for the stress my brain soup causes me. 

There's always a clear cut goal in sight, never a moment to forget what your doing or let your mind wander. the fact that you have so many specific goals, and are on a tight, but not murderous schedule is great.  

The characters are amazing and the art is adorable. Linus is a king, a Bestie, and deserves the world. I am also very homosexual for all of the bachelors. and Haley, shes kinda a toxic favorite and I'm living for it. 

I'm only just starting to get my footing with a couple mechanics so i don't have a ton to say against the game. I don't entirely love how fishing is done, but that's only a minor thing for me. 

I wish it made things like you NEED to have the silo before you can get animals or you cant feed them, or that you can also fish with the C key on PC more clear. but i figured it out. There's a huge community that's very dedicated to keeping information things extremely up to date, and I'm very thankful for that.

Overall 1000/ 10 would neurotically farm virtual peppers for the rest of forever. Thank you very much to the creators and community :)"
18682,:sans:
18683,SUPER FUN i recommend best 25 R$ i wasted on :D
18684,Haha fish B)

18709,i spend too much time in this game. maru wife
18710,"This game is nearly impossible to play without the wiki, which is the MOST annoying thing, however in recent updates I can tell the devs are trying to give as much information inside the game as they can. Still, it's not enough."
18711,"being rich, having a family, a house, a wife that loves u and stays young for all eternity. Damn this game just isn´t realistic."
18712,"Combined Xbox and PC time, I easily have 1000+ hours in this game. and I still keep playing it."
18713,"Can't put into words how much me and my family love this game. We played it on the switch for a couple hundred hours and wanted to play 3 players, so I bought my daughter a labtop and here we are! Yes, it's that enjoyable!"
18714,I like the part
18715,"Others have left more eloquent reviews than I can muster. I'll just say that this is the best farm sim game I've ever played. It is sweet and soft and beautiful, and the modding community is exceptionally healthy and friendly. This game has been a useful distraction during dark times. Thank you to the creator, ConcernedApe, and everyone else who has worked on this for making an extraordinary work of art."
18716,genre defining

18723,Good Game!
18724,Great game. No other words are needed. Buy now. Uhhh... Yeah... Thats all... Bye!
18725,This game is leaps and bounds better than I ever expected given the cost. I've purchased it for multiple systems and it is so worth it.

18740,"In this game you get to farm and mine be good looking and date/marry someone so it is completely unrealistic.
10/10 i wish i was as good as my character in everything"
18741,ya
18742,This game is wholesome and dangerously addictive. The story and the gameplay is satisfying. All around a great title to warm your heart with. :]
18743,used this game to fulfil my fantasies by roleplaying as a lesbian trash giver called dinklebert with my pet dog shmarby. thank you stardew valley for making my dreams come true

18745,who's that mf had the idea of making junimo cart and who the fuck accept this shit Im gonna find and clear them of from existence. I litterally had migraines from this shit.
18746,Very stressful and relaxing at the same time
18747,I've initiated a cult of this game. Proceed at your own risk.
18748,stardew vlaley :} have been playing for several years over abt three different devices and whenever it gets old to us we always find something new to enjoy in it. it's helped me connect w/ my long-distance partner and has just been a good game for a very long time
18749,"I absolutely love this game, it's truly my tiny peace of heaven. Whenever I'm overwhelmed or anxious with my real life, I love to dive in to my Stardew Life and feel a sense of control and calm taking care of my responsibilities."

18762,Good game to wind down
18763,so chill and nice farming game
18764,good
18765,"gud game, by now."
18766,This game is great to play cozy. Perfect for friends and family
18767,"Perfect balance of task-based and free-form gameplay. The combat is localized to allow players to know when they should be expecting a fight on their own terms, and the combat-creatures are appropriately not-scary to go with the overall feel of the game. Some character conversations can touch on heavier topics without warning, but most of it is surface level. Unfortunately, the game is excessively gendered when referring to the player, with dialog being specified to the male or female option chosen during character customization. There is an in-game way to change your character, including gender, but it costs in-game money and the dialog remains heavily, strictly ""Sir"" or ""Ma'am"". The NPCs do not make note of any changes made to the character and doing so only changes the dialog's gender-based phrases and looks of the character. It is also impossible to rename your pets, though you can change what they look like when far enough into the game (in the same screen as the character re-customization), so pick a name you know you'll like. Beyond that, and a few (accidentally, i assume) abelist interactions made regarding George (the elderly man in a wheelchair), the game is very inclusive and an overall wholesome experience. There are ample secrets to found, and the farming base of Stardew Valley makes it enjoyable to keep playing even after all the main tasks and secrets have been unlocked. ignoring the typically optional dialog with the NPCs, I highly recommend this game."
18768,i didnt even realize i had spent 50 hours in this game until i checked to fav it. good game 100% recommend

18790,"Fun to play with and without mods, have enjoyed playing a lot! winters aren't as fun the first time around tho!"
18791,"This game is fffing awesome!!! I've spent close to a thousand hours on this game on PS4 and all i can say is i wish that everybody would give it a shot because its way more immersive, gripping, heart touching, and addicting than almost any other game I've ever played 10\10"
18792,SV is a super relaxing and absorbing game. 10/10 would drive Joja out of the valley again.
18793,Highly enjoyable experience ngl
18794,Stardew valley is game which a lot of charm that really shines through the more time you spend with it. Every part of this game is a work of art but it may be monotonous for those who play more action-packed FPS shooters.
18795,Extremely good game
18796,"With even more hours logged on my Switch, I absolutely adore this game. It is beautiful, immersive farming simulator that has taken up countless hours of mine as well as my friend's time. Fairly easy to grasp for newer players, and yet there are ways to challenge yourself as a veteran player as well! Own your little farm, take care of you animals, gain friendship with the town, and even find love! How open and accepting the game is with mods is also amazing, allowing you to expand even more to your own liking"
18797,Love game concept but dislike how short days are in game
18798,good game   its good thing that you can mod the game every good rpg game

the new updates are super cute! it's a joy to play!"
18818,"game good, play it"
18819,so I would say I like the game but thats a understatement I have already 200+ hours. as of review. its calm relaxing and good simple game that you can spend hours on getting sucked into this little farming world. and you learn to care and love the place you made for yourself. just a good time give it a try not everyone likes farming and grindy games but if you need one pick this one up and give it a go.
18820,yes farm and baby making best game #1961
18821,"Although this game is a little bit stressful for me, it was created beautifully and I love the unique relationships you can form with the NPCs. For me, I like pursuing making money to help rebuild the community center rather than to be a blind profit machine. It makes me feel fulfilled :) The art in this game is gorgeous and the sound track is stellar!"
18822,"This game is my coping mechanism

18854,i can get stardrop that tastes like chug jugs
18855,This game has single-handedly ruined my life and put it back together.
18856,It's addictive -- that could be a pro or a con depending on who's looking at it.
18857,"Would I recommend this game? Absolutely! It's one of the few games I've bought multiple times to have on multiple platforms. The reason is simple; the game knows what it is and how to execute itself with wonderful ease and amazing fun. 

I never played games this could have been a spiritual successor to, like Harvest Moon, but it is one of the calmest and most satisfying titles of its like. You can swap out the quiet calm of your farm for exploring the mines, spicing up your game and letting you enjoy more. 

If you're looking for a game with a wonderful soundtrack, a fun little story, and simple and easy mechanics to it then this would be it. 

It easily makes my list of 'Must Play Games' should I ever get around to making one."
18858,"Amazing game, lots of fun much wow."
18859,"I've tried games often recommended by the crowd that likes stardew valley (think animal crossing) and before felt as though there wasn't enough there for me to play for an extended period of time. I do not feel that way with this game. This game is a good cross-over between minecraft, sims, and a classic dating sim. There are essentially unlimited avenues to play the game, i'm about 70 hours into just one save and plan on starting another one (without abandoning the old one) to try out different choices. If you like farming, mining, monster fighting, fishing, and dating simulators.. this is a good game."
18860,"This is a crop that my friend worked hard to grow. But now it's my cash cow. Oh, I'm sorry, buddy. I thought I grew it, so I pulled out all the crops you grew and sold them while you went to the bathroom. :D

18866,Only complaint is that this is too addictive. Help
18867,farming good
18868,very fun. very cool. slow but fun to play also its like a drug when you harvest and sell your crops
18869,"idk what to put as a review but i spent my most of my time in the mines just digging and fighting mobs
10/10 game"
18870,Good game to come back home to after a whole day of bullshit.
18871,"Tried this game because of the hype and got addicted for real! I love everything in this game from the story, gameplay and graphic. A really great game for me to play in the long time. Love it so much!"
18872,"I've bought this game on May 16 and now on May 26, I have 150 hours on record. Great game for solo players who want to chill and a much better game when played with friends. Mods also make it entirely better, whether the mod is visual or mechanical."
18873,Chill fun and simple.
18874,"Hi! Mr. Concerned Ape, I have a suggestion. Well, more like a request.
Would you please, please add Workshop? Workshop is an in-Steam way to run worlds and resource packs in your game.
 I would make it so much easier for me to install and play with mods, for I have had much trouble in the past attempting to run mods. I understand that this could a very long time, but if you would consider the idea, and perhaps even play around with it, I would be most grateful. 
Thank you for your time!"
18875,"Very fun, relaxing, and chill. It's also addicting. I love the game, 10/10"
18876,amazing game great to kill 400 hours
18877,Chickem
18878,Super fun game. Achievements make fantastic goals to experience all of the various aspects of the game to completeness
18879,"A nice and fun farming simulator, where the locals are pretty friendly!"
18880,"I'm not even close to finishing this game but i think that what I like most about it. I dont feel any pressure to do anything I don't want to do! You can easily lose time while exploring and rebuilding things across your town., but there's also fun mysteries and goals to reach for those who are more motivated in a ""completionist"" sense. Either way this game is big fun!!"
18881,Legit so much fun! especially with the Furry reskin! UwU
18882,"Love the game, Wish there was more clothing though."

i enter a trance-like state and lose hours of my life to this game
very cool would recommend"
18891,poggers game
18892,"When I first saw the game I thought it would be kind of boring, but I decided to buy it anyways and I do really not regret! Itś such a cozy game, it feels like a mix of Zelda and Minecraft. You can play the game in many different ways, you can focus on farming, fishing, mining or the animals. It doesn't really matter what you do as long as you do it at your own pace and your own way. Make friends in town, get a stable income. Try to calculate when itś the best time to plant your seeds, There is so much to do and I cannot imagine ever finishing this game because there is so much to do and so many different ways! I do really recommend especially to play with friends,.. The only reason I would see not to buy is if you dislike ""old"" graphics. It looks way older than 2016 but it somehow really fits the style of the game. If you prefer to play something with more action minecraft or some other survival game would be more your thing, but if not then really grab this game! Its totally worth it."
18893,I can be gay and that makes me very happy
18894,"It's an amazing, calming farm game that is super fun to play with friends or just go solo!"

Thanks a lot ConcernedApe. Sorry it took me 6 years to download and play your game."
18901,I love the cute aspect of the game! I really enjoy how simple the game play is and the relationships you can make with the npc's
18902,"Literally the only limits are your imagination. Speed run it. Slow burn it. Marry everyone, grow a tycoon. I've made a farm exclusively selling honey and honey accessories. 

I've been playing it on every system since it was released and I keep coming back to it."

18935,"A relaxing game where you can meet interesting people, form relationships, farm, mine, fish, sell your produce, and so much more. If you want a restful game where you get to collect items and spend your time doing regular daily activities like watering your crops. You might get lost in this game, but it certainly is pleasant."
18936,"Cute farm game, fun to play with friends or on your own."
18937,I LOVE THIS GAME
18938,Brilliant game! I grew up playing harvest moon and other similar games and as nostalgic as playing them can be they don't hold a candle to what Stardew offers! Especially with the available mods made by their loving and robust community. I keep coming back for more and I'm excited for the release of Haunted Chocolatier as well!
18939,e
18940,Coziest game I've ever played
18941,way better than talking to people irl
18942,This is genuinely one of the best games I've ever bought. Probably my second favorite after RDR2. It's so easy to get sucked into this world and spend hours on your farm just vibing to the soundtrack. 10/10 would recommend
18943,"Outstanding game. the fact 1 man made this game is mind blowing and really puts into perspective how good games can be when created by passionate people. if you want a relaxing farm simulator this is your game, if you want a action packed classic RPG this is your game, and if you just want a life simulator where you can form relationships with the character this is your game, so stop reading and start playing."

18976,"a wonderful game with intricate characters that keeps me engaged! i love so many aspects of this game; the dialogue, the quests, the farming, the blue chickens, completing the community center. 

my one (and only) beef would be the lack of elevator on the skull mines; as a player with hand mobility problems, combat is not exactly a suit of mine. I enjoyed the elevator on the first mine, as it let me brave the depths at my own pace and take a break/bail after only 5 levels, giving me the ability to go on short sessions while my stamina lasted and still return to my checkpoint later. the lack of an elevator on the skull mines is very dissapointing, as to go deeper then max 10 floors would be straining myself, especially with the presence of so many difficult monsters.

Non-the-less, that is a bit of a niche complaint; the average player will have nothing to worry about."

Started as a poor farmer and ended up playing this game for 150hrs (5yrs in game time) and with 10,000,000 gold in the end. Rich enough :D
One of those games which will never be uninstalled so that I can play this cute little masterpiece again, just to feel good.

19032,"I've been playing this game for years and years but I lost my old steam account so I have to buy it again.
It's incredibly immersive and really easy to lose yourself in, so be careful procrastinators!"
19033,this game can be a good time waster and with many diffrent mods if you want them it makes it a lot easier the controls are simple to learn and if you love games with no clear path to choose this games a win for you!
19034,Riley sucks
19035,"literally best therapy game ever, except my wife, Ivanna, wont let me see our matts anymore :( She is gatekeeping and not in the cute band way. I want to see my little babies again, I swear.

19045,"I would totally recommend this game to everyone. It has a little bit of everything. Farming, relationship, build a farm, mining, and adventuring. It also has a pretty good story and some voice lines you might not have seen on your first play through. 10/10"

19050,You can get all the ducks
19051,its fun
19052,"BEST Game ever played. 

I would say the game that you must play if you have spare time. The music, the storyline settings, the map, regular updates make this game always fresh and exciting. You will feel the time pass away instantly, there are always tons of stuffs to do no matter your in-game progress, even after completing the game. I have spent hundreds of hours in this game, and I would say am not regretting this. (I spent 120h to complete the game and all achievements, it is relatively fast tho.)

The multiplayer mode allows friends to join in the server and it was a great time playing with them. The game is not fast paced, and it is relaxing, peaceful which is a great place for both gaming and chatting. 

Although there are some multiplayer issues, that sometimes, players cannot invite others on steam and some minor bugs, otherwise, I will say it is a 10/10."
19053,"Incredible game, great music, great characters, and excellent progression."
19054,yes
19055,awesome. cool. fun.
19056,me like farm

19112,It's very nostalgic for me as I loved Harvest Moon as a kid.  This combines all of my favorite elements of Harvest Moon in a cute 2D pixel style.  I can spend hours in game because there's always something to do and it still gets new content!

19117,"It's a great game overall with many different things to accomplish depending on what you like such as character development, farming crops, crop qualities that can be bettered, mining, fishing, raising animals, and building an entire farm for yourself. There's probably more that I can't remember or haven't experienced yet but it's an incredibly fun game for whenever you have some spare time!"

19133,"Very fun to play with, loads of hidden gems. 
Loads of fun and beautiful mods too. 
If you didn't finish Harvest Moon because you find it too boring, 
please don't get this game, the base is quite similiar."
19134,"Extremely charming game. Definitely a game which lends itself to both casual relaxing play while still having room for people to optimize its systems. Singleplayer is ideal for getting to know the town, but coop is at times more fun due to the ability for each player to focus on what they find mo. st enjoyable"

19162,"Stardew is such a nice and calming game. You can take the game at your own pace and do whatever you want! It is a super nice change of pace from what I usually play. Playing some stardew at the end of a long day is almost therapeutic in a sense, it's overall one of the calmest experiences in gaming, and id fully recommend playing."
19163,naise
19164,"This game is good, I spent more time playing it offline for hours on end and honestly I was satisfied. I really enjoyed the experience that Stardew Valley had to offer. 
9.6/10"
19165,cute and based game
19166,"A beautiful conbination of addicting and relaxing- a farming simulator that reminds me of old harvest moon games. Play alone or co-op!

..I mean you can put on cute hats and buy chickens...do I have to convince you any more?"
19167,"Averagely good game for playing with 3 other friends as long as all of you could be online together at the same time. Festivals are relaxing, no competition at all, though multiplayer still prone to grieving. Control is fine, easy to master. Need mods to make this game more fancy. Some useful mods include NPC appearance mod, stuff check for beginners (with the cost of reliance of this really helpful feature), and mods for easy automation.

The downsides are problems when you play with bad internet connection. For non-hosts, moving to desert may costs more, more time wasted to go to the mine or even any other places, and lost benefit if disconnected exactly before the day ends. The game does instantly teleport player to the bed when disconnected. A LAN party is better recommended, tho."
19168,This is keeping me together i love this game
19169,Best game in the world.
19170,"yes, game good, many plant, much farm"
19171,Fun way to pass the time
19172,"It's a nice, cozy farming sim that has a little something for pretty much everyone. More chill players can simply farm and fish, while those who like a little more action can go down into the mines or try their hand at Skull Cavern."
19173,Amazing game.
19174,this game is my favorite ever 11/10
19175,10/10 game very addicting. best game to play when ur situationship hopping
19176,I enjoy this game. At first I didn't care for it and didn't end up playing the game for around a month after being gifted it by a friend and only playing once. I wasn't motivated on figuring out how it worked. After a bit of hopping back into it I noticed I genuinely enjoy this game on a late night after stressing about school and needing a break from constant stress.
19177,10/10 Amazing game
19178,Love Farming
19179,Very Amazing game. Great Artwork. One of the best games I have ever played!

10/10 would highly recommend"

"
19198,"I mean, you can probably get at least a few fun hours of entertainment from the game."
19199,[b]I bought this game a week ago and I have 55 hours already.[/b] I am obsessed. I like the farming aspect although some concepts are took me a while to understand. I wish there were more quests that I could do that basically isn't me being an errand peasant boy running around so I don't get whipped by my handsome yet sadistic and conceited master. The characters lack a bit of personality and I wish they interacted with each other a lot more but it's still really good.
19200,very fun
19201,This is a fun game and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested
19202,
19203,"If you like farming games there is nothing you won't like about stardew, best farming game out there with a great cast of characters and goals to complete, nothing forcing you to do anything, letting you play at your own pace and do whatever you want!"
19204,love this game so much
19205,gr8 game
19206,"I bought two copies of this game, one for my switch and now one for my PC. 

I was never a fan of farming games because I get bored really easily due to repetitive content and no real special things to find. This game squashed all of my concerns. I started playing this and was immediately hooked. There is a ton of content, interesting things to find, cool ways to customize your farm, and the ability to build relationships with characters that have their own likes and dislikes. 

You can absolutely tell there is an inspiration from games like Harvest Moon- another great farming game. I love that the problems I had with that game were solved with this one. Basically looked like ConcernedApe wanted a new Harvest Moon, but wanted certain problems resolved and set out to do that. But eventually it became a game of its own and set the bar for all future farming games.

It is amazing that this was all developed by one person and I can't wait for the new game ConcernedApe is making. I will absolutely be buying it."
19207,"it was so fun and worth the money, i love how inclusive the game is."
19208,I liked it
19209,"Stardew Valley is an open-ended farming RPG with a lot of depth and a good balance of sundry activities (mining, fishing, foraging, etc.), humor, drama, etc. It can be addicting and is a great game for both single player and co-op if you have friends. Every playthrough is different and if you want to keep things fresh, there is an abundance of mods available. One of my all-time favorites. I received this free as a gift but would have bought it myself and have gifted it to friends and family members."

Stardew Valley is a classic cozy game and if you do not have it your Library, I recommend getting it straight away!
Beware though, Stardew Valley throws you into the deep end with little to no tutorials and explination! Do not give up though cause once you get the hang of it (max 1 - 2 hours in), you will not want to put it down again!"

For me, I'll play for a week straight then I'll get bored of it and play something else. I've played the mobile game and the Nintendo version and the PC version is by far the best. Controls are a lot easier with a keyboard."

19276,"Owning your own house. Having friends. Not being crushed under the weight of corporate society. Do any of these sound pleasant to you? Then look no further, your fantasy is right here! Come experience the myth that is home ownership and small business in the 21st century, free from landlords, bosses, and the existential dread. Plant some crops, make some friends, enjoy the wonderful sounds of the valley. My only complaint is that it reminds me that real life doesn't have this level of polish and charm"

19285,"It's addicting. It's so much fun, especially when you play with friends."
19286,"It took me a really long time to give Stardew a fair shake. The game starts off really slow, and I got bored really quickly when I first tried it. Once you get in the swing of things, though, and more of the game opens up for you, it's a very pleasant, addicting experience. There's lots more to do than first meets the eye, and getting to know all the townsfolk on top of building up your farm keeps it interesting."
19287,Great game to play with friends
19288,The fact i can make my horse Epona with mods is the sole reason this game is top tier. Oh and the cute dinos
19289,Do I really need to explain how insanely amazing this game is?
19290,literally my fav game of all time ;p
19291,"very good to play, especially with friends, it's very relaxing and the game proposal is well presented."
19292,add meth
19293,THE BEST
19294,"I needed a bit time to get into it. One reason is that one cannot save the progress at any time, since this is done automatically at the end of each day (and ONLY then).

But when one gets more involved into the game it is extremely wholesome. There are many things to do and explore with so much love to the detail. And because of the big modding community one can customize the game to suite best for each playstyle."
19295,"This is a very fun game. If you want action, go to the mines. You can get married and have kids, too. But it is mostly about farming. Over all, I really like this game."
19296,"Amazing, this game is so relaxing you can fish, farm and go into the mines and it doesn't matter which you do every day."
19297,all women hot
19298,Just one more last update....
19299,Always will recommend this game. And made by one developer truly inspiring.
19300,"20/10 would recommend, friends and family are now concerned for me as I've become a cottage core gremlin 

Really fun gameplay paired with adorable interactions between the townsfolk makes for an incredibly addicting game that you can spend hours playing without realising just how much time has actually passed."
19301,chill and fun game
19302,"Good game to play with friends, addicting, :)"
19303,This is one of the best games that I have ever had the joy of buying and playing. The story line is amazing and the characters are top notch. My farm went from drab to fab! I look forward to more games from this creator in the future because I know that they will be equally amazing and enjoyable. 10/10

19306,I love everything about this game. I've never been so dug into a game that makes the time fly by so fast.
19307,sebastian good
19308,Very relaxing. Sucks you in. The type of game you can sit down and play for 5 hours and not even feel tired.
19309,"I can play this game for hours and never get tired of it!
If you like farming games like Harvest Moon and Rune Factory you should definitely give it a try"
19310,"I love the complexity of this game! You can create bonds, break them, fight monsters, get pets, upgrade your house and farm, collect animals, unlock mysteries, and more! I used to have so much fun playing Stardew with my mom and brother until my laptop broke, but now that I have a new laptop, I am enjoying the game once again! The only issue is that if you have an old computer or not very much storage, your game will probably lag and so will the music. Overall, great game!! Definitely recommend!"

19330,The most stressful relaxing game out there. if you like Farming and lots of time management than this game is perfect for you.
19331,Greatest Game of All time. Shane is god sent
19332,"TL; DR: Totally recommend. A superb farming-sim game, fun and relaxing gameplay.

This game is truly a masterpiece. With it's amazing and soothing music, beautiful graphics (that is suitable for this genre of game), Stardew Valley is one of the must-try games, and is super worth-it. The only complaint would be the range of NPCs' interaction and outfit; even though this still can be considered acceptable, giving the game was developed by only one man. In summary, the game is one of the most obvious choice for any gamers seeking some relaxing time after a long day of working/studying."
19333,Love racing coffee-high people :)
19334,very simple yet fun game to play even more so with a friend
19335,great game 10/10 would marry everyone again
19336,Its Great
19337,"I love Krobus. Every night I lie down and pray that my buddy Krobus could exist in the real world. Krobus is the single greatest best thing to ever enter my life and Stardew Valley is the single greatest best game to ever exist for having him in it. I went into this game blind so I was floored when I met him, and ecstatic by the way the player's relationship with him can progress (no spoilers). Best character ever. Best game ever."

The lore behind everyone and everything in the town is also good. It's has depth to the game which is unexpected but nice to have. It's just such a wonderful game to play when I'm not feeling good, it makes me very happy. It brings me comfort."

19380,"I would say this is a great game for people who like to chill and play ""comfy"" games. I really like how it was made, the music, game play, and how many things you can do in this game. Sometimes a bad thing can be that it is a little slow and you have to do a lot of things but there is so much to do and it feels like you always have something to do"

Something about building something together and watching it prosper hits hard, even if it's just virtual. Nice graphics, nice storylines, yeah...

Anyways yeah, I recommend the hell out of this game."

19396,"[h1] Stardew Valley Is A Universal One-In-A-Lifetime Experience [/h1]

[b]From the moment I started playing Stardew Valley, something clicked. The urge to go as slow as possible while trying to do so much in a day is a thrill some games just can't provide. [/b]

[i]Stardew Valley has a message.[/i][b] However, you don't have to be centralized around the idea of the message all game. Some games have a meaning that the entire gameplay and story revolves around, however, the meaning of the game is only a tiny fraction compared to the gameplay. It's crazy how much 1 developer, with enough time and effort, can create something that can strike peoples hearts emotionally.[/b]

[b]Stardew Valley can be emotional, sympathetic towards other characters within town, but the next second your harvesting 5000 blueberries and making 50 grand. So many possibilities in Stardew Valley, it's insane. Without spoiling this game, I just want to say, if you give it a try, you can't go back. I'll give you 20 minutes and you'll be sucked in.[/b]

[b]Buy the Game.[/b]"

19402,The art is so soothing yet interesting. People think it's just a farming RPG but the world and story is so detailed. I can't stop playing
19403,yo this game is cool
19404,elliott
19405,"Very yes, good stuff. Absolutely game, chicken always."
19406,"I first played Stardew Valley from my phone and the computer experience is much better. I couldnt run Stardew Valley on Windows 7 home edition. Now I have Windows 10 and haven't had any issues yet.
The game is fun to play and has lots to do. Which makes game play very enjoyable. The characters are interesting, the challenges are fun. Great game to play with a friend as well. Very pleased with my purchase of this game. Steam has been great."
19407,i keep coming back to this game. I've discovered mods and its the best thing ever.
19408,"one of the best farming game, 100% worth the money

19411,"Stardew is such a charming, relaxing game. If you're a fan of old school Harvest Moon-esque games, then you'll love it."
19412,very fun
19413,"If you don't already own this game, buy it now and join the hundreds of thousands of people who have fallen in love with Pelican Town and it's residents. At face value, it's a farming sim but it's so much more than that. You'll build relationships with townsfolk and learn new secrets. Uncover the magic of the Junimos and delve into the lore of what's beneath this charming little world. Sail away to a remote island and bring hope to those abandoned. Uncover treasures throughout the land, in the mines, caves, and volcano! Upgrade your home, decorate, plot your land, redesign for optimal farm production, keep farm animals happy, fish, make honey and wine, forage, and so much more! You may not know what you're doing in the beginning but you will soon realise it's all coming together and you'll be ready to take on new challenges. 

This game has an amazing fan community. You'll quickly understand why. I recommend learning more about the game's creation from the ground up. It's truly inspiring!  I've purchased collectors edition sets and will support the developers ongoing projects. Stardew Valley will always be one of my favorites!"
19414,"Perfect game, you can play however you want and however fast you want."
19415,A great game that started off a little overwhelming but using the stardew wiki helps out a lot espcially starting off. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a chill game.
19416,"I'm very late to be posting a review for such a well-known game.  By now you've probably heard what a fun, immersive and just all-round great game this is.  This is one of the rare cases where all the hype is more than justified.
When I first thought of posting a review I glanced at the game page and thought it said I'd played 3.4 hours.  In fact, I'd already played for 34 hours.  Time truly seems to fly when playing this game.  I've enjoyed every facet of this game.  
Whether it is farming, fighting, fishing or foraging ( a true 4F game) I've had fun.  There is something for everyone in this game and I recommend it."

19431,"playing this game is my stress reliever, except that one time i got frustrated by skeletal hand"
19432,Great game honestly! Want to relax and pretend you have a life outside of this PC you're on? Go ahead an buy it! Between school and work I have managed to rank up some 20+ hours playing this game in one weeks time - Who needs sleep anyway?

19449,"Got the game on a whim with GameStop credits a few years ago, and it was one of the best video game purchases I have ever made. It is extremely fun with so many layers that you don't really notice until you get really into it. It is also really fun to play with a significant other until they wake up, run straight into the mines and you are stuck watering all of the crops and run out of energy and need to wait for them."

19460,"It's honestly hard to believe that I've been playing this for nearly 7 years. It was fun to learn single player, and there is an absolute litany of things to be done in the game, I still don't think I've done everything there is to do. The replay-ability is fantastic.

Then on top of that, they added and maintained and updated multiplayer. To the extent that I first played this game with my friends, and now I play it with my kids. This is a wonderful balance of calm and active with a little bit of something for everyone. 

If you haven't played it yet- you should."
19461,"much good, happy marriage, all children"
19462,Absolutely lovely
19463,"Best game I have ever purchased in my life! I have played this since the first versions came out and I have adored it ever since. It is such an adorable and relaxing little game, I love everything about it, from the pixel graphics to the amazing little villagers with all their personalities."
19464,"Super chill game. Even more fun with friends. Building your farm up and getting your loot makes this game the best farming game in my opinion. There are several challenging things to accomplish, and just when you think you've completed the main part of the game, it opens up and reveals even more. There is so much to do, and your possibilities are endless. One thing that I will say is that for your first playthrough, avoid watching too many guide videos; that'll take away the chill vibe you get from your first playthrough. On your second playthrough though, go nuts; min max every day and get basically infinite money. Worth a play alone or with your friends."
19465,"This game saved my life.

I am 50.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as."

Everyone I know keeps telling me to play this game, but I seriously just can't find the appeal to it at all. I play it for, like, fifteen minutes and I'm already bored. Someone please explain just what's so fun about this game because I just don't get it. 
Not saying that it's a bad game, 'cause it's not bad. I just find it incredibly boring, I guess."
19505,fun very fun a bit grindy though but the fun and athsetics out way the grind.
19506,"This is my favorite game and I've loved it for years. I first got it on my PS4 and then on mobile, so I'm really excited to have it for PC now too! I've spent hundreds of hours playing and I still have so much of the game to explore. I've been wanting it on PC for a while so that I try to do more serious minmax runs. It has something for everyone and is pretty friendly to people just entering the world of video games for the first time. I highly recommend this to anyone that has even a passing interest in it, worth every penny of each and every copy of this masterpiece I own."

19516,"Not much can be said about this game aside from what has already been said... but MAN, is this game amazing. I love how no matter what you want from a game, Stardew has it. If I want to chill, craft, decorate a farm, I can have a load for that. If I want combat and to work until my last sliver of health and energy to craft, you can do that! The characters are well fleshed, the town feels like a place you want to live in real life (if anyone knows of IRL Pelican Town....)... it just has so much to offer. Even if you don't think you'd like it, I'd recommend at least trying it once. There's tons of replayability!"

19544,so good game amazing 10/10
19545,"stardew valley is kind of the best at what it does.  This game organically teaches you how to play very well without ever having pressure on you.  it is fun to optimize and min max, there is high value to replaying the game, it has received support over the years with several substantial content updates, the world has a lot to dig into as you go further and is just a really great game.  it is not for everyone but if you even think you might like this kind of thing stardew is one of the best at it."
19546,It helps my anxiety

19559,"this is a really cool game. i enjoy it a lot. very cute and wholesome but you also get to murder monsters. so, awesome."
19560,"Amazing game for people who like calm, relaxing games. Despite this game being great for just chilling out, it has a lot of purpose in everything that you do, there are goals that you work towards, rewards that you excitedly wait for, and quests that dedicate time and effort into doing."
19561,fun...
19562,farming
19563,"Great time killer & stress reliever - bought it on a whim and have been addicted ever since.

19572,This game was so much fun to play and so interesting to follow the story but also make your own story
19573,this game the sole reason i almost failed physics

19575,ye
19576,A nice cozy game for any skill level.
19577,"Pretty great game! I'm loving it, helps a lot with my gender dysphoria too, so I'd recommend it if you have that too."
19578,"Always a game to fall back on for relaxing. I could never thank ConcernedApe enough for making this game, I even bought the board game and it DID NOT disappoint. I can see myself playing this game for years, just started getting into mods and they are amazing as well. Try Pokefy mod if youre into pokemon!!!! 5/5"
19579,fun and peaceful game
19580,freakin  awesome

19584,I ENJOY THIS GAME THOROUGHLY
19585,good little gay farming game
19586,slay
19587,"writing a review before even playing on computer because,, yes!! i have this game on xbox, and now my laptop. the fun thing about having it on my laptop is i can finally mod it omggeeee, so ive been looking forward to that! over all its a very fun game, theres lots of quests to do as you progress through the years, and super cool heart events! stan sebastian, husbando <33"
19588,amazing
19589,yes
19590,fun game
19591,This game is a great way to while away your time!  You've inherited your grandfather's farm in remote Stardew Valley.  Can you bring the farm back to life again?  Play and find out!
19592,stardew is a great game and i think everybody should play it
19593,"Funny number, I like farm"
19594,"It's very easy to ""accidentally"" play this game for a few hours straight"
19595,"vary god gem, I lkie it vry muc"
19596,good
19597,i cant stop
19598,i like dog
19599,"You can name the chickens.
5/5"
19600,I absolutely love this game. It's calm and peaceful and almost makes me wish I had a farm to run away to.
19601,"harvey is hot, i would definitely not let him near a primary school though, that tasche is pretty sus."
19602,bruh this game is such a serotonin supplier i love running around being a lil farmer making friends and everything
19603,"Incredibly addictive. Abandon your life, and play Stardew Valley."
19604,"One of my favorites, if not my favorite, game probably ever! I can play this for hours and hours on end, and rarely do I ever get bored."
19605,excellente!
19606,ITS GOOD.
19607,Finally finished creating my character
19608,vibe
19609,This is my favorite game of all time. It really relaxes you with the amount of things to do while still being engaging with the mix of farming and combat. Such an amazing game.
19610,Chill game
19611,Fun if you don't worry about making the friends with the town. Just do your own thing.
19612,e
19613,"gud
"
19614,"Love the game. As a beginner, it really is easy to learn on how to play."
19615,"Amazing game, i own it on every platform i have"
19616,it's a good time!
19617,I simply love this game <3
19618,"Very simple, not crafting/surviving based."
19619,"Stardew Valley is honestly a gorgeous game. There's so many different tasks to complete, and the repetitive nature of the game I find incredibly relaxing. Want challenge? Stardew has a bunch of hard to collect items and monsters to fight. Overall, 10/10 game."
19620,"This game has a LOT to offer. And I mean, LOTS. Right when you think you've uncovered all that there is, this game gives you even more to things to explore. Concernedape is a fantastic developer, and it's absolutely mind-blowing to know that he made this game all by himself. 
10/10 recommend; it's a great time-killer. Also Elliott is the best. I love that guy, and having the option to romance NPCs regardless of the gender of your PC is epic. We love LGBT rep in this house. :)"
19621,"I never really enjoyed farming games before, but man oh man this game is AMAZING!"
19622,good videogame
19623,"It's a very fun game. There is farming, mining, fishing, and more. You can also have a relationship with some of the villagers. It's not really action based but if you're tired and you want to play a game just pop this on and you wont have to focus too much. I've played it for more than my record says since I do have a copy for my PS4. I do recommend it. It's even more fun if you play with friends. There is multiple save slots so you can have a save for just you and a save for your friends. But by far my favorite feature is you can go through people's trash."
19624,"this is my life.
"
19625,
19626,Super chill with friends
19627,"cakep, dah gitu aja"
19628,"Great game, got to smash"
19629,Farm. Nice.
19630,"this game is great and i love playing
"
19631,very fun farming game
19632,"A really rewarding, calming game with a bit strategy and a lot of planning involved. Lots of freedom to do and make things and a lot of dynamic. Extensive story lines and a good amount of exploration. Recommended!"

19634,simple but fun
19635,"There are no words to describe this game fully. It's relaxing. It's varied. The music is enchanting. It's super fun and deeper than it seems to be on the surface. I love this game. I come back to it again and again, always finding joy in it."

19643,i left my wife over this game
19644,very chill farming simulator game
19645,Right now you cannot play multiplayer without people disconnecting for no reason. Dont buy if you are planning to build a farm with your gf/bf you are just gonna rage as the other player is getting kicked out.
19646,Best game of all time
19647,"you can pass out from being at the saloon for too long, 10/10"
19648,ehhhh its okay i only played for 749 hours
19649,it is just simple good fun
19650,Pretending you're a farmer is low key vibes.
19651,Best farm game
19652,"Played this back when it was still in beta originally and now I've returned to it. It's a fun time waster, can't really criticize it. Multiplayer is immensely satisfying"
19653,"The perfect game for a video game date, plenty of time to talk while not doing very difficult work. Not talking from experience."
19654,shane is hot

19659,"its really cute and addicteing
"
19660,life ruining
19661,"While some people may enjoy this game, I clearly didn't. It's quite repetetive and boring, but has a really nice artstyle and it's pretty fun to play with friends... just get's pretty boring really quickly. I suggest you try it out and see if you like it, DO NOT BUY IT FOR FULL PRICE! Wait for a discount."
19662,THIS GAME IS FIRE 10/10
19663,"find the best waif u want, they all have pixel butt but its fine, u can have ur way with it, the lil idiots are the proof of that"
19664,Very good game!
19665,Just... Get it!
19666,I got to cuddle :D and grow plants
19667,"The best farm game since Harvest Moon. I love getting to know all the people in the town, helping them out, rebuilding the community center (JOJA GTFO), and tending to my farm. It's great both solo and with friends.

Just. Get the mod that turns off the fishing minigame. It sucks. Genuinely."

19679,Its a fun game and relaxing
19680,"This game is incredibly good. Super fun, and I've spent a lot of time managing a pixelated farm on my PC. Also if you don't like the music from this game you're lying to yourself, its so atmospheric and just a jam to vibe to at 3 am"

19719,"Sebastian my beloved
"
19720,this game makes me happier than anything ive ever known. i know its sad but uhhh whatever i love alex
19721,"Great game to listen to music and pass some time on. The farming is relaxing, social interactions are refreshing, and a little monster slaying to break up a long growing season. There's always something going on in town and the events throughout the years make for interesting and captivating game play. Multiplayer is great and opens so many opportunities for how you play the game. Best of all, the game runs well even on a potato!

Happy Farming!"
19722,"I love this game. Though i mostly play it modded here on steam and Xbox regular. Much more fun when you mod it, I love when i mod it since i can marry the Wizard then, i love him. and more animals is fun too. Base game is still great too! I play it with my friend which makes it so much more fun to play with others. One of the games i play constantly now since its relaxing"

19757,Super fun! game that i could play for hours!
19758,hekk yeah
19759,"Stardew Valley is THE best game I've ever played hands down get the game. If it's to hard or you just wanna have fun it's super easy to mod, or just play the base game."
19760,"I rather enjoy this game. I like it more when playing with friends, but single player is also fun!"
19761,"I've mostly played this game on my switch, but from my time on there, I can easily say that this is one of my favorite games.  There's an endless amount of fun as a solo or with friends. It's also pretty relaxing until you get to the skull and volcano mines lmao."
19762,One of my favorite games ever. Keep up the great work ConcernedApe =)
19763,i left my girlfriend for shane
19764,"Great game if you like games that involve farming, however dfon't buy if you have a friend named klussi."
19765,Great game! Fun to play with friends
19766,mm
19767,its a fun and piecefull game
19768,I love this game i also love how you can all sleep together onto one bed that only fits one person.
19769,hmmmmmmmmmmmm                    turnip
19770,"banging game, absolutely love it. super addicted atm"
19771,"i play this game with my bf and we both have a lot of fun. its kinda like 2d minecraft but with less of the ability to build whatever you want 
"
19772,It's chill and fun!! love it
19773,yes
19774,I don't know how to describe the amount of effort and love in detail this game has. It truly is incredible and I can't recommend it enough especially for old Harvest Moon players.
19775,takes 100h to 100% after which you'll never touch the game again unless you wanna marry some more (and didn't mod to be able to marry all) or there is a new update
19776,Why I have spent my time for this
19777,"love love love. the co-op mode can be a little fussy sometimes but it never takes long to figure out. im america based and ive even been able to play co-op with friends in western europe with little to no issues. i havent completed my first full playthrough yet which shows how much gameplay it has. there's so many aspects and for me it never gets boring. this is really great to play with friends and to play by yourself, and is really good (for me) for destressing. 

only thing i would change is being able to upgrade your friends' homes on co-op mode, and them being able to pick which house they get when they log in for the first time. if that was an option i feel like it would be way more feasible to do super long lets plays with them long term. another thing is that if you have a coop world and your friend plays when you're not online, you lose hearts with the villagers bc you're not interacting with them. im not sure if theres a way to fix or pause that. overall very great game and 100% worth your money (for both the game and the soundtrack)"
19778,"it does be fun
"
19779,"Own this treasure across multiple platforms - just can't get enough! So wholesome, calm and such a treat to just take you away from daily life whether its from chaos, or just to change things up. A+++ game. Can't say enough about it!"
19780,"This game deserves all the praise it gets. If you're on the fence, just go for it. There's a little something for everyone."
19781,"It's fun, kinda challenging at times but overall, it relaxes me."
19782,Funny farm very cool
19783,"This game is an amazing way to escape, not only is the source material phenomenal but it has a large modding scene to add fresh content. Can't wait for the follow up from the game developer!"
19784,"Good game to play with a significant other, or a close friend if that's not your thing."
19785,Living the trad life
19786,"It's really fun 
there're many things to do in game 
i like it better when i play with friends
"
19787,it's amazing
19788,Really addicting
19789,"For now i have only 9 hours on steam but i have more than 100 on the switch version.

Get all the best aspects of Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons, some rune factory, purge all the bad and frustrating parts, put some more quality of life, some good plot, characters and some new cool mechanics, why not? Also, charge like 1/5 of what a normal story of seasons/harvest moon/rune factory would cost, then you have stardew valley. It's by far the best game in the genre, since it's release, and it just got better and better over the years. A dozen or more farming, monster ranching games release since 2016 but none were able to reach this one. Aside from terraria, it's the best bang for your buck you gonna get on steam for a long time. That is for the single player

Also, great music and charming graphics. If there's one thing that maybe you gonna find better in other games is the graphics. But c'mon, this whole thing was made by one guy.

Also, did you read that this game is multiplayer too? And it's so seamsless i can't believe, you and your friends can tend to different tasks at the same time on totally different parts of the game. While one tend to the crops, other can tend to the animals, other can go buy some seeds, other can go hunt in the dungeon. If you want to farm a lot you can all work at the crops at the same time, do whatever you want, i dont care, the game lets you! It's a feature so well realized, i never saw a AAA game put so much effort in it's coop.

If you don't know if you like this kind of genre, this is where to start."
19790,"Stardew Valley is exactly what you need at the end of a stressful day. The game is full of calming music and weather sounds. The in-game characters are diverse and interesting. You may find yourself becoming attached to them, I know I did! The game is endlessly re-playable, there are different maps you can try out and endless ways to format your farm. You can replay the game and try to get closer to different characters, or you can even try speed-running to get hearts. If you are looking for a calming game full of content or a stress reliever that makes you feel warm inside, this is the game for you."
19791,It's pretty good
19792,good game

19838,"This game has a surprisingly huge amount of content. If you start playing this game you will not regret it. For efficiency nerds, the time limit each day forces you to be as efficient as possible. For those of you who enjoy adventure, there are several unlockable areas filled with content and hidden easter eggs.
Easily a 10/10 game."
19839,farm farm farm
19840,"this game is really cool and good. if you're an inept-because-you're-only-casual-gamer like me i recommend looking at the wiki to figure out what's going on and how to progress because it doesn't give you a lot instruction wise. some criticisms i have though are that it doesn't have a nonbinary gender option (i'm guessing the gender really just effects the look of the sprite and since it doesn't affect gameplay i suppose it doesn't really matter but it still irks me to have to choose it). another thing thats annoying though im sure this is just steam glitching and nothing on the part of the developers it just annoys me enough to want to talk about it is every time i close the game my hours go down. i've been at like 90-something forever. i'll have the game open for multiple days and it'll say 135 and then i'll close it and i'll immediately see it go down to like, 96. it's been doing this since i got it and ough i hate it. otherwise though this is a pretty cool game with lots of stuff to do and i like farming"
19841,YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
19842,Makes the pain go away
19843,Lo selso farm
19844,Flawless. Amazing. Highly Recommend.
19845,Its a lot like cigarettes it looks stupid but its addicting.
19846,Chill farming game with depth in spades. Love it and would recommend anyone who likes a relaxing farm game with some adventure thrown in and lot's of resource gathering.

19857,big farma
19858,"just an overall nice and calming game, with so much to do!!"
19859,Lovely farm sim with mining and social interaction with MPC's. Relaxing and engaging. Delightful story lines. Crafting and upgrading are great. Collecting items and progression.
19860,Good game
19861,Amazing game! I am playing it with my mom.
19862,"Best game hands down, second only to Minecraft. (I also recommend Terraria if you're looking for a game similar to Stardew Valley/MC.)

I wasn't sold on this game initially. Everyone was talking about it. I was watching Lilsimsie (a streamer) a lot at the time, and she would often have Stardew days on stream instead of sims4. One day I ended up watching some of her playing Stardew and I ended up buying it that same day. My husband and I were obsessed with it. 

What immediately got me hooked is the same thing that keeps me coming back to re-play it. The atmosphere of the game is so relaxing. The graphics are an acquired taste, initially off-putting, but now, extremely charming. The story is charming. The decorating/setting up the farm is a lot of fun. The holidays, the way time passes, the seasons, everything about it. 

I love how on second playthroughs (or more like 5-10 at this point) you can go about it completely differently. First time we focused on farming. Second we focused on fruit and fruit trees for wine/jams. Third we did animals and farming. Fourth we tried just doing a small farm with mostly mining/exploring. There are a ton of ways to play the game to make it feel fresh.

I'm so glad he is making a sequel."
19863,i grind like a little goblin
19864,"So good I can't wait for his new game to come out, and in the meantime I'm trying to get perfection on this and then I'm gonna do a playthrough of Stardew Valley expanded"
19865,goo
19866,"its good to play for people who like minecraft, survival games, and cute games"
19867,mmm good :)
19868,"everything
"
19869,it has a farm in it
19870,super
19871,liked a lot
19872,Its an amazing game I don't think I need to add anything more.
19873,"as a guy with crippling OCD life is hard, but this game is so fun, everything fades away for a while. I love this game so much. it is essential for any steam owner"
19874,"One of the few quality games, I highly recommend it, if you have friends it's even better!"
19875,Shane <3
19876,I'm farmer joe
19877,Its cool
19878,tiz good
19879,"This game will suck you off,
I mean suck you in"
19880,"I love it. 10/10, I've played almost 900 hours and I'm still not tired of it."
19881,Good
19882,"Love this game! I don't have a lot of time to play stuff during school semesters, but Stardew Valley remains a constant source of stress relief even when I have very little free time. It's a great game to boot up and play for a few minutes with something playing in the background. Or you can take an entire day and fully immerse yourself into the game and its world and forget everything for a few hours. You can play it as casually or as seriously as you want to. Hard recommend for anyone who is into management games; Stardew Valley is very popular for a reason."
19883,"A task filled game, there's always some adventure to be had. Easy for beginners to play. Super addictive."
19884,Great Game
19885,game recommend you can have a gay farm with your girlfriend
19886,"good
"
19887,"A single man made a timeless classic, revamping and building upon harvest moon. what more to say...
Just buy it."
19888,"Such a fun game to play, its simple and cute with multiple great stories within it. I've loved the late game content as well and it feels like it just keeps getting better and better. Totally recommend!"
19889,"I haven't played for very long, but I was already a fan of the Story of Seasons series and this is better than that. The farming and mining mechanics are both easier and more forgiving than in SoS, though the fishing mechanic is a lot harder (I'm REALLY bad at it). Overall this is more than worth getting for the price that it is. If you're wondering if you might like it or not, def recommend getting it to try!"
19890,doesnt have any kill or murder in it right thats why i need it
19891,
19892,"Absolutely love this game, it's so chill and wholesome. I'd even say it's a comfort game for me, I get lost playing it. If you're looking for a calming game you can play for hours i'd definitely recommend stardew valley!"
19893,"I enjoy the fact that you cannot ""lose"" the game. There is no deadline for completion of any main game items. Because of this fact, I do not feel compelled to look at the wiki as often as I do in other games. The enjoyment of exploring this world for myself is therefore unique and enjoyable."
19894,Man this is goofy ass minecraft knock-off
19895,yes yes much good
19896,Amazing game.
19897,"Very sweet, but gets a little boring if you play it for too long at once without breaks. 

I definitely would recommend if you love farming and pixel games."
19898,"really fun and relaxing, lots to do, really cute art
"
19899,"THE GAME
"
19900,"I have replayed this game so many times, I feel guilty for how little I paid. The first dozen times was on an Xbox, but now on the PC it has opened a whole new world of mods. Relaxing, and involved, the best money I have ever spent on anything."
19901,This game is fantastic! I enjoy playing it a lot! Its a nice game to just be able to relax to or I've seen people speed run. You can keep playing a file for so long or have multiple saves! It is a very versatile game! Co-op is also a great option for playing with friends and SOs.
19902,A very zen game to relax to.
19903,"Dude we all know this game is good,
Yes im addicted, i have it on 3 different systems.
Yes I always find myself coming back to this game.
Only thing i wish is that the multiplayer was cross platform and that's really my only complaint. 
And the fishing isn't that hard, you will get use to it."
19904,it is a very slay game
19905,You can marry a character and the blacksmith will ask for advice on how to hit on your wife
19906,i farm :)
19907,"Great game. Lets me play out my fantasy of being a transbian farmer. Characters are great, the spritework is great, the music is great. I love it."

19918,"You will very quickly sell your soul to this game. But it'll be the most cosiest, relaxing soul deal ever."
19919,YES
19920,"I dont think any game does it quite like stardew. Countless ways to play all accompanied by the same charming art style and wonderful soundtrack. wonderful co op option too, farming parsnips or slaying slimes in the mines with friends is a great experience."
19921,Very fun farming game
19922,yeehaw
19923,This game has been consuming my life. Run
19924,Beautiful game
19925,"I've tried the cracked version of the game before and it's so much fun, and now since it was ky birthday my uncle got me this game because he know that i love this game. Definitely a 10/10 but before you actually buy and play it i would recommend using the cracked first so that way you can see if the game actually fit for you."
19926,cat
19927,still can't date moms
19928,"This game is awesome. Worth more than it costs, most definitely."
19929,Great gameplay
19930,"ive played this game for 441 hours at this point, im not sure what more i could really say to sell you on it. oh- you pet the chicken and it goes cluck <3. 10/10 sebastian is the best romance option, fight me"
19931,"This game is amazing. It's a relaxing game that doesn't really force you to do anything. Everyday you can decide for yourself what you want to do, fishing, mining, farming, foraging or even talking. There are plenty of  options to decide from. Whenever I don't know what to do I can always come back to this game and have a great time. You can even play it with your friends for more efficiency and more fun."
19932,quandale dingle recommends this game
19933,Mexico valley
19934,"instead of leaving me his farm, gramps left me his old meth lab"
19935,"Everything about this game is fantastic. I definitely recommend playing with mods if you want to keep the momentum going, however, the base game is also super duper fun."
19936,I find all aspects of the Game very fun and addictive
19937,"Mostly fishing while the lady takes care of the crops at our County Folks Farm.

Bless ya."
19938,I guess its pretty fun
19939,yee haw
19940,"I simply cannot recommend this game enough. It may not have been the first cozy farm sim, but it is certainly one that others seem to want to imitate. I could go on and on about how amazing this game is, but I will save you the time and just say, PLAY THIS GAME. If you start to get bored about 200 hours, mod it, and play it some more. The BEST farming/life sim out there. Simply none better."

19956,YES
19957,Stardew Valley is a fun farming and fighting game. There is even a co-op mode so you can play with other players if you ever get lonely!

I'll let my time played speaks for itself."
19970,smashing everyone in town
19971,Great game that's easy to get lost in
19972,"I mean, what can I say about Stardew Valley that hasn't been said before? I was initially turned off because I was stupidly biased against the pixelated art but I'm so glad I changed my mind and tried this game. For the price versus content, you're getting so much. It's a hodgepodge of things: farming sim, crafting, fighting, rpg-ish. It's simple yet complex, it can be tedious or chill depending on how you play. I've played about 600 hours and I think I only started during lockdown. On top of that, there's a large modding community and so many mods that can add hours of content. Thank you CA for making this wonderful game!"
19973,"Great way to feel accomplished and keep your mind busy. Love the relationship building as well, and the secrets keep you on your toes."
19974,Linus is pretty hot

19984,This game is easily worth my $15. My girlfriend and I grinded this game for hours without getting tired. Simply good.
19985,"even years in I have played this 4 times through, and now a 5th as a streamer! Still an amazingly fun play."
19986,"great game you should deffinitly play :)
"
19987,"I used to rip on this game for being too mellow and not engaging enough. This is actually ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I received this game as a gift from my girlfriend as she was sure I'd like it and she was right! This game is engaging and enticing. It incorporates a lot of tasks within a reasonable time limit and has many different features. I definitely would recommend this game to others and to those who are hesitating, just give it a try! It's not that expensive and it'll be worth it~"
19988,"Oh man, where to start... Well, I LOVE this game. I have spent so. much. time. playing this it is insane. I find it enjoyable, funny, and a great way to de-stress. Towards the end of the game, things slow down a bit but there is still so much to do! I highly recommend this game and intend to keep playing it in the future! :)"
19989,The story and attention to detail after just 1 person created this whole game is truly amazing and I keep coming back to it every few months just to play it again! And lately the modding community for this game is putting in a ton of work and helping expand on the already amazing game of Stardew Valley!
19990,fun to play with gf
19991,Very plant much farm!
19992,very fun. NPCs are lovely and there are so many ways to play this farming game.

20022,Lots to do no matter what mood you're in
20023,It's such a fun chill game! It's got a good mix of story gameplay and making it your own.

Until you dive into Skull Cavern, that is."

20033,"This game is meant for certain people. I enjoy this game a lot and theres so much more to do then what comes to the eye, you can Farm, Fight, Fish, Care for animals, design your farm, complete the story and more. If you get bored really easily this game isnt for you its very fun to relax and even loads more fun with mods I Recommend it"
20034,"I highly recommend Stardew Valley. Even though I haven't played it much on PC. I had a lot of hours on mobile when I first got into it, and then ranked up hours on Switch when playing with my GF.

This game is great for both single player and with others. And is fun playing over and over and over again. (as well as they sell cool merch too)"
20035,"Can you pet the animals? Yes
Is there a fishing minigame? Yes
Are there crabs? Yes
Must-play game."
20036,I like farming.
20037,veri gud veri nais
20038,it is cool
20039,"Just a lovely game, that you spend 30 hours playing, and wonder how that was even possible. When you think you've seen it all, they introduce something completly new. I've played for 55 hours as of writing this, and i still feel there is content for at least a 100 hours more. So don't get fooled: the price does NOT match the amount of content this game offers.

Also, the soundtrack is banger."

20042,"It is the business managing game that I was looking for, it also has some adventure but it doesn't have the violence and blood I totally dislike. It has a nice backstory, lots of fun characters to interact with, romance and fun game music."

20052,Cute
20053,"A great time waster when you have nothing better to do, managing your farm is very relaxing. I never get mad while playing this game no matter what and I love how this game tackles the NPCs, with all of them having different personalities without any voice acting! A definite must-have game to maybe calm your nerves or just have a great time! The only think I dislike is the pacing, it's a bit slow but everything else makes up for it."
20054,I LOVE FUNGUS SO MUCH GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGH
20055,"this game is so fun! I've played it on switch and Xbox but decided to get it on pc for the mods and I have never been happier.

20079,"This is one of my all-time favorite games. It's relaxing and fun, a good way to step away from everything for a while. I used to play this game with a bunch of old friends, and it was some of the most fun I've had in gaming. I plan on playing this again with more friends, and I highly recommend playing with your friends."

20084,slay
20085,"rawr its a chill farming sim with some dating (if you want to do that, not necessary) and honestly you get to hate a bunch of characters but like in a way that you love the game. i dont know how to explain it tbh.."
20086,It's very fun
20087,Super fun. Super chill.
20088,"All of the graphics are adorable. Really love the storyline and all there is to do in-game. Cute variety of bachelors and bachelorettes! 11/10, would recommend; got me through quarantine."

20090,Very good game if you like farming games but it is also so much more
20091,"I am nearing the end of my first year in the game. Now I have started and stopped this game so many times in the past. Played alone and with others, I am currently playing again alone. I am enjoying the game so much and love the story and everything that goes into this game. It's so zen and chill if you want it to be. Farm, have animals, go mining. I highly recommend this game."
20092,Literally the best game in all of existence. Actually the most differential game I've seen in my life.
20093,fire game
20094,I really like this game a lot. You kind of just get lost in all the game play. Its very relaxing and a nice way to wind down from a day!
20095,game is dope
20096,"Nobody's gonna see this anyways, so eff it.  8/10.  What makes it an 8/10?  It doesn't have lazer dinos.  Why would this game have lazer dinos?  I don't know, that's not my problem.  8/10."
20097,"No one:

Absolutely no one:

Abigail after one month of marriage: ""Wanna have a child?""

20107,can't shmooze the clown during the fair event.
20108,"A nice and calming farming game where you can play at your own pase.

This game is amazing and the fact that it was only made by one person is insane."
20109,is good
20110,One of my favorite games.
20111,good shit. my 1 hour streams always turn into 3 to 5 hour streams.
20112,its a great calm game to play when you just want to chill
20113,"i love this game so much :,( my friend made me download it and it quickly became an addiction. id recommend this game to anyone who likes lighthearted and wholesome games !"

I like the Adventure but recently i lost all my god tools like the gold scythe"
20115,wasting my life away but its ok
20116,best farming game i have played in a long time! i enjoy farming with my friends and siblings.
20117,"My all time favorite game! I bought it on two systems: pc and switch. I seriously have no complaints about stardew other than ""can the game be longer?"" Its super relaxing and the only stress is how much stress the player puts on themselves to get certain tasks done. Some things in the game are time based such as how long your crops take to grow or quests you can accept from villagers to complete. All of the villagers have good stories and you can establish relationships and make friends. The game has everything: fishing, fighting, farming, exploring, etc. I do wish that maybe there were more pet options or that there were a few more farm types. I really hope ConcernedApe makes a second game!"
20118,good funky farming game
20119,"It's surprisingly fun for a slow pace farming game. I give this game a 10/10
"
20120,"Remember, no Joja."
20121,I liked everything about this game
20122,Such a cute game with enough options to play it over and over again.
20123,Stardew Valley is very fun :)
20124,I love it
20125,"I've outlined some good and bad things about this game below:

The Good
-there is SO MUCH to do it's actually ridiculous
-the romanceable characters are very cute and diverse in personality
-most of the heart events are solid, and i like that you have dialogue choices for these and when you talk to the villagers sometimes. the heart events will affect the game, mostly through dialogue
-very high replayability, as there are lots of choices affecting your playthrough
-the game is essentially neverending so you can just keep going in a save you really like. this also means you can set your own goals for yourself in game
-the game is still being updated, meaning there could be improvements later on. the ginger island update, for instance, was huge and added so much more to the game
-theres a lot of excellent mods
-the music is really good

The Bad
-the dialogue is very repetitive
-once married, your spouse doesn't really do anything. it's kind of depressing, they just kind of wander around and stare at household objects 5 out of 7 days. it feels like you've trapped them rather than married them, and they tend to lose that spark that drew you to them in the first place
-many of the non-marriageable characters can be kind of flat. i'd like to learn more about Marnie, for instance, and develop more of a relationship with her than is currently possible
-some of the controls can be confusing or frustrating, like how sometimes if your mouse is too far away you'll end up hitting a spot you didn't mean to and destroying your crops. i'd suggest turning on the thing which shows you where you'll hit immediately, at least until you get used to the controls

overall, this game is very good and definitely worth your time. 9/10"
20126,"Love this game! I recommend playing it through twice, once with the extended mod pack for more story!"
20127,"Don't write this game off, it is one of the best games ever made in the genre and is worth a try for anyone, even someone who has never touched this kind of game! :)"
20128,Relaxing and engaging! My all time favorite game.
20129,it gud
20130,i have been addicted to this game for 4 years now.  I LOVE IT I am so glad i can finally play on PC
20131,Sebbie we need to Cook
20132,"Outstanding!!! So much content in the stories, skills and game play. Over 100 hours in now and still got so so much I'm excited to do.  I very much am addicted and don't feel like I will get tired of it any time soon. Also has multiplayer option and it's so much fun to play with friends. 100% worth a play."
20133,farm go brrrr
20134,"One of the sweetest and most calming games I've played in a while. Absolutely amazing character designs and stories, love it sm!!!"
20135,"GOod game
"
20136,"Wanna create your own harem? Do it! Wanna focus on one love interest? Sure! Wanna marry the shadow man that lives in the sewers because he is basically allergic to the sun...? Not my cup of tea, but you can do it! You can even live alone with your farm animals and money. Leave the boring city capitalist lifestyle to become a MILLIONAIRE! Only complaint I have is that you can't overthrow the local government.."
20137,"Gotta say, I adore this game. I grew up playing animal crossing, something about the simplicity of a life sim where you build yourself up slowly always captivated me. Though, the most recent game really disappointed me, but then I found Stardew. And honestly, this game is everything the latest animal crossing game wish it was. Though, comparing this to AC is unfair, the overall quality of everything trumps any of the newer features the games have to offer. I like how regardless of how you take the game, you're never failing. You can rush through, get married, focus on profits, and it's all correct. Regardless of what some fans may tell you, there really is no wrong way to play Stardew Valley, and that's honestly a trait i love in a game. A game that is so rich with features and story, yet no one way to ""win"" it either. It really is just a happy, honest little farming game :)
(though, one gripe, i dislike the combat, but not everythings perfect!)"

20144,"played on switch moved to steam for mods
"
20145,Very good chill game
20146,"One of my favorite games ever, played the game for 16 hours straight every day for a week. Starts off slow but picks up very quickly after knowing what to do. Getting used to the routine you make, feels like another life besides reality when you delve in too deep."
20147,best game
20148,"The most relaxing game ever. Except the mines, the mines are not relaxing lol."
20149,Very good chill game
20150,"I love the play style, graphics, and story. Tasks are difficult enough to keep you challenged, but not so hard you get too frustrated. I keep coming back to this game and playing old farms or beginning new ones."
20151,fun
20152,Amazing game with hundreds of little hints and clues.
20153,great if you like wine
20154,It be fun
20155,Very fun game!~
20156,One of my favorite role-playing games. It has it all! You don't even have to make a farm to have fun with the game. A perfect country role-playing game for everyone 13 and up.

20160,"This is a cute and engaging game that can be played in a lot of different ways.  With the popularity of it, there are a ton of mods now available to continue offering variations on approaches.  You can be any type of farmer that you want to be.  It's highly flexible and allows for pursuing different goals with each new play through.  The challenge level is as high or low as you want it to be.  Would def recommend it."
20161,"140ish hours in and I've only just ""finished"" my first play through. Nice little relaxing game to just chill and grow crops at your own pace. There is a suprisingly deep amount of lore throughout the game. 

Join Us. Thrive."
20162,"I Loveeeeeeee love this game its very Peaceful and can take your time with it day by day. it helps me not stress to much about things and i love the Characters. But I do wish that he Npcs would Age over time.
i understand that the Birthdays are ways to Gain Hearts but what if you are full on Hearts..then there really is no point on trying to remember their birthdays. let alone nothing gets Exciting after a while. when having your own Kids (i have yet to go through that YET)
i see/hear that they stop at toddler age and i think that is Sweet and all! but i feel they should be able to age into Adult hood and you can become an Elder. Of course over the YEARS in game play. adding to it would be nice and others having kids let alone maybe even new people Joining the town! just some ideas to throw out there

over all the game is Great!"
20163,I play this during my zoom classes. Perfect game cause it doesnt require too much
20164,"I’ve put in about 350 hours into this game and it still stands as my [b]favorite[/b] game of all-time (Tied with Harvest Moon DS, of course)

I’ve played multiple saves and I enjoy it every time as if it was a brand new experience.

If you like pixel graphics, crafting, farming, grinding for materials, caring for animals, fishing, mining, building relationships, easter eggs, and more... Then, this may be right up your alley.

I adore this game and I’ll be showing this to my kids when I have them in the future. But for now... If you’ll excuse me, I have some strawberries to tend to."
20165,I love this game
20166,"Fun, relaxing game that I can play for hours."

20199,I've spent 350 hours of my life in this game. 2 weeks and a little more worth of time. I can whole heartily recommend this game. ive modded it for my last  couple of play through but vanilla has plenty enough for a few playthroughs. Tons of things to explore find grow and do. 10/10 would recommend to anyone.
20200,"I had came into this game with 12 years of playing minecraft. Thought it would be a nice alt game, and boy if you are in LOVE with minecraft, this might not be for you. The game seems too direct (not completely, but you have to do something one way to get it unlike minecraft (multiple ways to get one item). Do not let this sway you if you aren't someone who just loves minecraft, i know a lot of people who love this game. 11/13 people I asked like or love this game."
20201,The only game I know of where I can domesticate a chicken man. What more could you ask for?
20202,Buy the game. Won't ever regret it.
20203,"You'll finally be passing out late night, drowning in chicks and perhaps, the coolest guy in town! At long last you get to explore some hills and holes like never before, your bushes will grow plenty and after years of trying, catch many a fish in the ocean.

As I write this Reiner is standing at my side.

He knows this is a love letter but he’s still sneaking glances. Honestly it’s no wonder the creep is still single.



That said, he did give me his word that he’d deliver this letter to you. He says he owes me for the time i doubled back to save him.



I’m sorry about that. I never would have imagined myself choosing those two over you.



I’m gonna die soon, but I’ll die without regrets…Or that’s what I’d like to say. Truth is, I do have one.



I never got to marry you…

With love,

Ymir."
20231,"Fantastic game, hours and hours of fun, it never gets boring. There is just so much to do, the most annoying part is saying hello to everyone when you first start the game, but battle though, it's worth it! ;-)"

20238,"This game at first looks like a wholesome farming sim. It is far more than that and it will consume your life!

You play as a farmer in a definitely apocalyptic world of war and famine. Capitalism is everywhere and the dead are now undead. The villagers are so realistic that most of them (If not all) are horrifically depressed. You will unfold a story so deep you will try to remember a time you thought it was just a wholesome game. 
Your character runs a farm (one of the few establishments not paying a tax due to the overwhelming need for new farmers to fight the food crisis.). 

The music will draw you in! Awesome soundtracks to fit the themes!

Choose your favorite villagers and look on the Stardew wiki to make sure you get them only gifts they like. As you get hearts with them cut-scenes will play and show you just how much the world has affected the characters. As you grow attached to the characters you will want to help them but there is only so much you can do.
Eventually, marriage will be an option and you can start a cute little family! [spoiler] You can choose to make children go away and that choice will haunt you all the rest of your playthrough. [/spoiler]

At one point this game broke the Geneva Conventions. It is true! Look it up!

SPOILER DARK STUFF:
[spoiler] Some characters will battle with addiction, suicidal thoughts, alcohol poisoning, depression, PTSD, etc. 
You can use spells to make villagers forget you cheated on them and spells to turn your children into doves who fly away and curse you forever. [/spoiler]

Stardew Valley has also been confirmed to have violated the Geneva Convention. An update fixed that but it did one violate it.

This game will be a part of your life and you will never come back. It will become you! YOU SHOULD GET THIS GAME!
Oh, and it has multiplayer."

20240,This game is just a vibe.

20253,"I've just started my second year on SV and I absolutely love it. The control the player has over the pacing of their playthrough while still being under time constraints (seasons, limited time during day) is fantastic and really lets you choose exactly how you would like to play the game. The romancing system is rewarding and super cute. But my absolute favorite aspect has to be designing the farm. You can choose what you want to invest in, from crops to artisan goods to slimes, and though there is a 'meta' for profit I'd say it's still open. SV really lets you customize your playthrough.

All around such a good game, especially for a 1-person development team! My only complaint is that it's way too addicting ;)

20254,"One of those wonderful kinds of games that you can chill and relax, or totally immerse yourself in, and definitely will struggle not to buy for every system. It's a well put together game with a lot of little nods and extras that really show the effort that went into it. Goodhearted and genuinely a fun game to get buried into!"

20259,"i mostly played this game on switch, i just love this game sooo much!! the steam version was gifted to me and i really like that i can mess around with mods now that i don't have much to do on my late-game switch save anymore. definitely get this game if you want something new to be obsessed with for at least a few months :tabbycat:"

20267,"10/10! Highly recommend!

I've been playing this game on a Mac for over 5 years and it's the best farming sims out there. Highly enjoyable whether you are a newcomer to the farming sim world or a long-time Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons/Rune Factory fan."
20268,Its really cute and i love the animals and the design potential
20269,Its such a cute game and its so stress relieving that I could play it all day!!
20270,"super fun game! This game is perfect amounts of pretty pixel art and stressing farming sim.

Your grandpa has given you his old farm in a town you have never been to before, you meet the townsfolk (most of which are extremely nice and welcoming with their own personalitys and interests!) you can give these townsfolk gifts and talk to them aswell. You can grow crops on your farm and raise animals (cows, pigs, sheep, duck and even dinosaurs!) there's also the opition to go mining to get resources, to travel to a far away island, to even marry and live happily with one of the townsfolk!

This game is just and amazing and well-rounded game with heaps of content that will last hours (easily 100+ hours) with a story thats goes at a nice pace. So many enjoyable characters and niche mechanics that truely make this game feel different from other games in the same genre. I would give this game andd easy 9/10 or even higher, and recommend it to anyone who loves farming games!"
20271,i am typically a fan of faster paced more action based games so i was genuinely surprised to find myself enjoying this farming game so much. there is so much to do and enjoy and appreciate and the way that this games makes the world around you feel like a real little town is miraculous
20272,Great relaxing game
20273,"really cute game! it has so much to do within it and its hard to drop it. really recommend to anyone who likes very cute, calming, grindy, immersive games!"

20285,This game is addicting. I love the interactions and the farming is great. I'm addicted.
20286,"REALLY fun, incredibly chill. A wild cross of Animal Crossing and Terraria. You can farm, forage, take care of animals, mine, fight, fish - focus on anything you like to be honest!  Gifting the other villagers stuff they like (especially on their birthday) ups your friendship with them - the bachelors and bachelorettes you can even marry and move in together with, unlocking more dialogue and adopting kids together!

its fairly easy to mod aswell - incase you are interested in modding - and the applicable mods range from cute to helpful to memes. The music is also incredibly charming all around!
Nothing bad to say about this game"

20297,"Highly recommend if you’re looking for a game you can play alone or with friends (if you have any) that you get lost for hours in gameplay. The story is sweet and the mechanics are simple, you’ll fall in love with the town and it’s characters :)"

20310,I love this game to play alone or with friends. I play a lot with my partner and it’s so fun! Farming mining discovering together and working towards a farm goal.
20311,"Many hours sacrificed to the gods in this game, many more still to give."
20312,"This is my absolute favorite game on Steam! Between the storyline, the character depth, the amount of activities you can do, and the stunning design, I couldn't recommend this game any more. I really didn't understand what I was getting myself into when I started playing, but to say I fell in love with it is an understatement. It also doesn't hurt that the community is just the best!"

I love farming furiously, but I think I love raising the animals the most and designing my perfect farm with a mix between structure and wild. I'd recommend this game to everyone."

It's extremely comfy and the music and art direction are magnificent. I cannot say enough to praise this game. And if you have a computer that can handle modding it, the modding scene is pretty alive and active and has some really cool/useful mods. Though I highly recommend playing it vanilla before you mod it, don't rob yourself of the first time experience of this wonderful game. Looking forward to Concerned Ape's next game, Haunted Choclatier!"

20363,So much fun !!!
20364,"Excellent and wholesome game to play alone or with friends.

A simple chill game where you move to you can plant fruits, vegetables, etc. on a farm, can befriend the townsfolk of Stardew Valley, witness the Jojamart and Pierre conflict (complete the Community Centre to see the best of it), and even fall in love and start a family.
 
The villagers have lovely and interesting stories for those that are interested in the social aspect (I recommend Leah's for best experience), the museum and Community Centre collections are good for completionists, and the feeling of success through farming, artisan creations, and mining can satisfy money/business-orientated players.  The seasonal events are fun at first, but lose their spark after playing the game for a few in-game years. Artifact, mineral finding are a pain but anything for a full museum! 

The multiplayer is easy to set up and allows you to easily make farms to play with your friends or significant other.
The in-game emotes are adorable and are my favourite part about the game even though it's such a small detail.

Only thing i complain about is that steam hasn't yet allowed easy community modding of the game (but once you do dive into the mods this game that is already easily worth twice retail to me jumps further than that)

Not just for the opportunity to mod it to my liking, but because alone, it always makes me happy. I hope to those who decide to pick up this game can also find a happiness here like I did."

Now that is out of the way, literally everyone is likeable and if you get the Stardew Valley Expanded mod, YOU GET MORE, AND EVERYONE IS MORE LIKeABLE THAN PIERRE.

The hints at secret lore and the general secrets are hidden gems to find and make the game feel so alive. That's really it lmao, just a really bloody good one."

20436,great game
20437,"It's just unendingly pleasant.  Sometimes it's tedious, but it kind of tries to remind you to take things in their due time.
It makes good use of time overall and feels nostalgic for something simpler, but with extra whimsy.  No characters feel repetitive or same-y, the quests are mostly easily achieveable but take time and sometimes forethought and planning.
Eat your heart out for enthusiastic modders, you name it, they made it."
20438,"Great game, great creator and everything is amazing"
20439,it's good
20440,"I, like others, have been waiting for a Harvest Moon game to come to the PC for such a long time. The Harvest Moon series has been one of my all time favorite series I've played since I was a kid. I'm so glad this game came out and became as successful as it did as so many other farming sim games have been starting to come out as a result.

There's multiple farm layouts to choose from at the start of the game each giving you an advantage in a specific skill and changing the main way you earn money and how you play during your playthrough. The game has farming, fishing, foraging, mining, combat, exploration, and so much more.

Like the Harvest Moon series you can grow many crops depending on the season, care for your animals and farm materials from them such as milk, eggs, wool, etc. and craft it into other items which you can then sell. You can get married and have children in the game, you're able to upgrade your tools, buy furniture, expand your house, get a horse stable, build chicken coops, sheds, silos, barns, and choose where on your farm to put them, and so much more.

The game has a museum where you can collect books, gems, artifacts, fossils, etc. and complete the museums collection. You can restore the community centre unlocking locations, buildings, and more.

There's so much you can do in this game and you can easily get more than a hundred hours, even several hundred hours just from a single playthrough. Not to mention there's various mods you can also install to add more content to the game and get even more hours out of it.

The game has great music and chill gameplay if you just want to sit back, relax, and have some fun in a stress free game (unless you're like me and make a list of the best gifts to give to every npc, make a list of which fish to catch during which season, time, and weather and make sure you get everything within the first year, and use a farm planner to pre-plan the entire layout of your farm).

This is another good cost to hours game, where it's only $17 Canadian (less during sales of course) and you can easily get several hundred hours or even more than a thousand. It has great replayability with so much to do in the game, just don't go to the arcade in-game and play Junimo Kart. 

I would easily recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of farming sims such as Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, Rune Factory, Innocent Life, etc.

(Seriously, don't play Junimo Kart unless you're a masochist)."
20441,One of the best games i have ever had the pleasure of playing
20442,: )
20443,GOAT game
20444,Hands down my most favourite game
20445,"The game is a nice relaxing sim game. Its just a comforting game where you can get married, have children, and run a successful farm. Also, you can sacrifice your children, kill dragons, gamble, and cheat on your spouse. You also live in a town with a corrupt mayor :)
11/10 game would recommend."
20446,"I have played this game for years and I have yet to become bored of it.  There is always something new to work on.  I love that this game is somewhat story based, yet also very open for you to do what you like."

20459,"I""m sure all of the great points of this game have been said, and said better by others, so I'll just say this:

This is such a soothing yet vibrant game that is very worth the price. Thank you ConcernedApe for making this game!"
20460,yeah
20461,"TLDR; Best game I've ever played! Great for playing alone or with friends. Super cute and fun; I absolutely recommend this game!

Stardew Valley is my favorite game I have ever played. I have always loved videos games growing up, and I've played all types of games over the years and I honestly would recommend Stardew Valley over everything else. It is a great mix of relaxing and content filled game. There is so much to do in the early game and mid/end game (there is not ""end"" to the game, but there are late game items and things to unlock which is what I mean by end game). The game is super cute and soooo detailed. Like amazingly detailed. Every NPC has an explore-able backstory and they are extensive and intricate it is amazing. The game is so impressive in even just that one aspect alone. The soundtrack is beautiful and just so calming. The animals are so cute!!! I love watering the crops and saying hello to the animals every day and getting to know all the NPCs. I play the game with my partner and it allows us to play video games and still spend time together. We both enjoy games and it's always nice to have more games that we both enjoy that we can play together. We have also played with other friends who also really love the game and we always have such a good time (except when someone dies in the skull caverns of course). It is the perfect game to play with friends or alone and I tend to have trouble finding games that are just as enjoyable in a group as they are as a single-player. I just can't say enough good things about this game. I 100000% recommend anyone buy it if they are thinking about it."
20462,"Good, relaxing game. Stardew Valley is a lovely land that you will get lost in. Whether you are farming, mining, fishing, or building relationships; this game is great! I love all the little details.

20477,i love the npcs
20478,"I debated on playing this game for years, and finally decided to purchase it on my phone about a year ago. I absolutely loved it, then realized it would be better on the Switch. I dedicated so much time to it, with around five or six hundred hours in it, then I decided I really wanted mods. So I got it on Steam. I've bought this game three times, and while it isn't an expensive game, three purchases should speak for the love I have for this game. I would absolutely recommend anyone who loves farming sims to play this. I even have my four year old playing it. It's game for any age."
20479,this games keeps me entertained forever!!!! i play it every day and its definitely worth getting!
20480,so incredibly wholesome :)
20481,its really fun! it can be hard to get the hang of at first though!
20482,"
Don't under estimate this game. It is so addicting"
20483,very yum game.
20484,Oh my god what a cute game! I love this game so much! This game has a great mix of fantasy and reality! There are so many moments where i have talked to one of the AI in game and felt like I was having a conversation with a real person. They did a great job on making the townsfolk so closely related to the people you could meet today. One of the things I really enjoy is that the game progression works at your own pace. You can choose to progress in whatever way you feel like so you don't have to feel the need to grind it to be happy. I would 100% recommend this game to anyone!
20485,"The creator for this game is notorious for actually listening to players to improve the game, the soundtrack is lovely and ambient, there is constantly goals to reach towards (if you choose) and things to do, so although its a game that is considered more idle, it won't ever be boring/ devoid of things to do. It has everything: even mining and some combat."
20486,By far the cutest game I've ever played. Recommend playing with boyfriend/girlfriend.

20503,"I've pumped hundreds of hours into this game on switch, so I thought I'd grab it on PC to play with mods & it's completely overhauled the game for me. Dispite having played the game to death, the whole modding community has brought it back to life with the complete expanse of the game.
For me this is the pinnacle of farming RPGs. I've played a lot of harvest moon in the past and this game improves on the formula in every way. It takes away a lot of the monotonous parts of that style of game, offering ways you can make farming life easier.
One of the greatest parts of the game is the choice, despite it being a farming game with a storyline, you have the option to completely disregard all that and play it however you want - from farming, mining, combat and relationships, there's so much to do in the game you have hours of playability."
20504,"Girlish lovely, but not my type, maybe I will pass down the game to my 10 year old daughter 20 years later, if I got a girlfriend"
20505,"Stardew Valley is probably one of my favorite games on steam! 
There are many different ways to play the game; from being a multimillionaire to just enjoying the fun farm life! 
I really suggest this game and for me, no spotted bugs, lag, or glitches! Have fun and enjoy - Jelly <3"

20516,idk
20517,A cute game that has so much more then meets the eye in story telling and game-play. Honestly some of the best NPCs I've ever seen

20532,cute little farm game
20533,fish
20534,its a grate game
20535,farm make depresso lesso
20536,:D
20537,"One of my favorite games. The graphics are amazing, and each of the characters that are in the game are interesting in their own way. The only criticism I have for it is its combat system or the fishing mini-game, but those are very minor compared to most things."
20538,Noice
20539,This game has let me live my alternate life as a farmer 10/10 with rice.
20540,"I love Stardew for its infinite ways of play. You can farm. You can mine. You can forage. You can do any combination of these things and play at your leisure. I spent over 180 hours playing this game on Switch and still, to this day, love it more than any other game I've played."
20541,Helps me forget I'm alive
20542,Amazing
20543,Very good game
20544,"I was initially hesitant to buy this game. I've never been one for ""life simulators"" and typically hate doing any farming even in games. But one day. On a whim. I saw that it was super cheap and said. Eh why not. I played it for a little bit and was quickly overwhelmed. And then didn't touch the game for almost 2-3 years! 

Finally again, on a whim I decided to give it another try one day. And I fell in love with this game. It's more than just a simple farming sim. It's a community sim. The interactions with the people and rebuilding the community center. Just feel ... nice. And having previously worked for real world walmart. The MC's dislike of Joja kinda resonated with me. Making it feel a lot more personal. Even, more immersive.

Look there's a frickin list a mile long that could be said about what's GOOD about this game. And more is STILL being developed. And almost every single con I can think of is either being slowly patched by the dev themselves or can be fixed with mods. Even if you don't like this type of game. Give it a shot. There's a LOT more here than farming and talking to people. And if you simply have to have combat in the game that's there to. There's caves you can go in for resources and monsters to fight but ... you don't HAVE to do anything. 

Stardew is the most chill game i've ever known. The game doesn't care how you play it even if you do literally nothing at all. As long as you're enjoying your time that's all that matters. The only real end goal is having a functional farm by the end of year 3 but even that is OPTIONAL. Just get it. Try it out. And don't stress about anything.

The game's meant to be taken at a relaxed one day at a time pace. Who cares if something is suboptimal. Who cares if you're not making a million gold a day. Who. Cares. If you don't even do any farming. ... Just enjoy it."
20545,"This is the game I play when I am frustrated, upset, or otherwise down. This game brings me great joy and peace. If you want a game that is full of peaceful enjoyment, this is a game for you. I have nothing but positive things to say about this game."
20546,Better than real life 10/10
20547,good game
20548,Fun Game
20549,love how it is open world but simple to the point im not confused every 5 second on what to do
20550,"If pixel art isn't your style, PLEASE don't let it keep you from trying this game. It's absolutely worth a shot if you like games such as Minecraft or Animal Crossing. Though the main gameplay elements are centered around the farm simulation, there's a ton of strategy and room to learn/hyperfocus with combat and mining elements. In addition to that, who you befriend first really matters. There's a diverse cast of characters, and certain villagers can help your playthrough along in ways that others can't. My favorite part about the game is how much it teaches you to fully utilize each day. Time goes by quick, and the only way to stop it is to not be actively playing (menus and dialogue will pause the game, for instance), so you have to plan ahead to make sure you stay on top of everything. The time restraint is even more evident in co-op, where pausing isn't an option AT ALL (save for very specific circumstances), giving it a certain challenge to balance out the extra helping hands on the farm. Lastly, it has great mod support if you want to tailor the gameplay or art more to your taste. I won't spoil anything, but this game has more content than you think, with more on the way. Give it a try if you haven't already!"
20551,very cool
20552,buy this damn game. just do it. i cannot express my love for this game in any words.
20553,"Its a fun farming game idk, multiplayer fun"

20572,ye
20573,"It's not that good, but it sure does remind me of when the days were glorious."

20575,Awesome
20576,Abigail (and sebastian) my beloved <3
20577,SLAY WHAT YOU WANNA SLAYYY
20578,"Stardew Valley is a remake of Harvest Moon from an alternate universe where the developer had deeper ambitions than to dump out essentially the same game year after year with a lazy theme change and scant graphical upgrade. There's more plants, more upgrades, more activities, more choices, more villagers, and more waifus/husbandos than ever before, and it was all made by one guy. The daily routine is soothing and the relationships with the townspeople are surprisingly involving --option to sell out to Wallmazon aside.

It also has regular (free) updates, like it's some kind of labor of love or something!"
20579,Very fun and very relaxing.
20580,I love this game. I'll come back in a month and see my hours. 05-14-2022 I have 89.5 hours.
20581,As a massive flirt it's the game for me.
20582,"I just started playing and it was awesome. This game has a lotta great features, and it has great pixel art too.
so yea, great game. 100/10 recommend for pixel gamers"
20583,Ok
20584,
20585,stardew valley is a great game but my games glitched the screens turned warmed colours and zoomed in to the side
20586,this game is an amazing game full of so many options possibiltys andadventures and have a tone of easter eggs and secrets
20587,"very fun, good game"
20588,Gud
20589," I cannot even begin to describe the experience this game has been. It has been such a beautiful escape from reality. I literally cannot recommend it enough. There are literally a million hidden things for you to find and just when you think you've seen it all.. oh and did I mention this game was made entirely by a single person? Everything from animations, music, coding, was all done by a single dev. Concerned Ape has truly created a masterpiece with Stardew Valley and I promise if you're willing to put the time and effort, this game will shine extremely bright for you as well. You won't regret it."
20590,Yes
20591,"✩ 4.5/5 ✩

This game is amazing for anyone who enjoys slow-paced role-playing games with an emphasis on NPC relationships. Even though the story is still relatively the same every play-through, there is enough variability that it somehow stays fresh every time you play. There are so many areas to explore, things to unlock, and people to meet in this game!

PROS:
+ Realistic NPCs
+ Many customization options, for an easily replayable game
+ Multiplayer support
+ Something for everyone, be it fishing, farming, caring for animals, combat, and more.
+ Very aesthetically pleasing, with many options for home decoration.
+ Lots of lore and story elements to puzzle over.
+/- VERY long. The Community bundles take a LOT of resources, and unless you check the ""completable in first year"" box, it isn't guaranteed that you will complete the community bundles in the first year. On top of that, there is still so much to do, so you if you're the 100% completionist type be prepared to invest a lot of time into this game.

CONS:
- One big con in my opinion is the lack of a gender neutral option in the Character creation screen. The game does allow you to marry a character of the same gender however, so I have some hope that the developer will add that at some point.
- The game does get repetitive and does require some micromanaging.
- The world is not large and does not have much to explore, though I suppose that's intentional because of the ""small town"" aesthetic of the game.
- The player character can only be altered late-game, with the exception of clothes: befriending a certain NPC will give you access to creating new clothes, though that does (expectedly) take a while.
- Sometimes the screen will be zoomed really really far out, seemingly for no reason. Using the built-in ""zoom"" option is not preferable as the game becomes incredibly blurry. The solution is to change your resolution to something else and back again, though this does not work 100% of the time.

Overall, a very well-rounded and fun game! Great for passing some time alone or with friends and family, and is sure to keep you occupied for quite a while."
20592,Love the game play and the story line
20593,is nice..
20594,10/10 couldn’t recommend more!
20595,i love this game. it has women <3

20597,"A coworker of mine said ""relaxing games don't exist"". I said, ""Wrong, Stardew Valley exists."" 

This is a great, stress free, casual gaming experience. Made for the gamer who just wants to spend a few hours sitting back in their chair and forgetting the troubles of the world. 

Very fun and addictive game. Who knew growing crops and selling them could be so rewarding?

10/10. Buy this if you need a break from the fast paced, high energy, break neck speed of most games. Load it up and lay back!"
20598,good
20599,"My hoe is still a normal one, didn't upgrade it.

20622,s good
20623,"Literally in my top 2 favorite games. It's always between this and Animal Crossing as to what I'm playing. It's so much fun, relaxing, and as strategic or chill as each player wants to make it that day."

20640,"Starts slow (if you are new I guess?), builds up and gets better and better. There is a lot of depth here; everything from farming to processing the product into other things like hops to beer. Then fishing, mining, etc. Very relaxing game, cannot recommend it enough."

20677,"Probably the game I have sunk the most time into. Very big, very fun, there's so much to do, and the replayability is one of the  best of any games.
Most of my fun has come from playing the vanilla game, but this game is only improved on with the millions of mods that people have made for it.
Recommend to anyone who is looking for basically any play style. It will work for anyone (Fighters, farmers, RPG players, etc.)"

Only thing i can say it can be a bit rough at first not having enough money to buy certain stuff at the start but no worries, the game gets super smooth after a while and you'll end up having the farm of your dreams.
There's a wiki for everything you want to know if you can't figure something out.
Currently been playing this 60+ hours with my hubby and i'm having a blast! 
"
20690,if only i had this much money in real life

20692,Great relaxing game
20693,"Only just started, but such a cozy, amazing game! Has a bit of everything I love (Lovable NPCs, Customizable farms, battling in the mine, collecting things). Really addicting but you can also limit yourself if you need too, it doesn't require massive commitment."
20694,"I hate you person who forced me to buy this, it became a vice but I really love this, I never thought I would like it so much, playing with friends make the game easier and more fast but also playing alone it's pretty good.
૮꒰ ˶• ༝ •˶꒱ა ♡"
20695,"great game overall, ConcernedApe is a great game creator. I'm excited for their upcoming game Haunted Chocolatier. Stardew is a very nice and relaxing game to play at your own pace, with interesting stories each NPC shares when you befriend them more. The storyline of the game is pretty interesting. I recently finally got 100% perfection in the game.

the game can sometimes get a little stale if you don't have goals set to accomplish (at least in my experience, as someone who has played multiple saves.) first play through of the game is very interesting though, so I wouldn't worry too much about getting bored. Lots of ways to play the game, you can focus on farming, fishing, ranching, brewing, etc.

Definitely recommend as a game worth the price and provides hours of fun."
20696,"Haven't played much, but for the 20 minutes I've played it, i could see why people would like the game. since it has so much content to offer you, I'll might continue playing this game in the near future"

The game is ridiculously charming and time will fly playing it. Can't go wrong with this one. Farming? Check. Fishing? Check. Making wine and cheese? Check and check. All the good things. Plus you get to support a cool dev, whats not to like you know?"

20708," One of the friends to whom I recommended SD 3-4 years ago has over 1300 hours played and still loves it.   Over 300K players have already recommended SD and with good reason.  It's the 5th most modded game in Nexus.  It is one of the most open ended games around, despite being set in a very small game world.  The game designer/developer is still working on improvements for one of the most popular games.  Lots to like in this little town.  And the price...such a deal!  Well worth a try."
20709,I enjoy playing this farming role-playing game. You can build your farm alone or with someone else.
20710,sunflowers
20711,fish .
20712,yes
20713,I love this game! 10/10!
20714,"Fun solo and co-op, gameplay is fun but repetitive. Graphics and soundtrack are good. Worth the price."
20715,"Probably the best game I've ever played. Cozy, fun, and just all around an addicting game."
20716,Game is so chill and fun to play with friends its almost therapeutic
20717,I'll beat a motherfucker up for smashing Linus' tent
20718,good game ez
20719,"Amazing
"
20720,fun with the right person
20721,I don't even remember playing it for that long
20722,Amazing game!!!! Love playing multiplayer! <3
20723,I love this game! Super relaxing and fun
20724,oh my lordy lord abigail is such a bad bitch
20725,"There's a lot to do, and there is an incredible amount of endgame stuff, as well as nearly unlimited re-play options. It's a great game, and you learn a bit more about it each time you play."
20726,the first night i got this i stayed up until almost 6am playing it
20727,help i cant stop playing omfg
20728,"There's nothing I can say about SV that hasn't already been said, except to confirm that after you've played it to death,  learning to use fan-made mods is a WHOLE new ballgame. It's really revitalized my interest in this game that I've been playing since launch in 2016."
20729,"Nice pixel characters and with all very fun interactions with items and NPCs, love all the ideas even from long years ago - and even love it more when I knew it's created by just ONE PERSON! :)"
20730,"Farming is fun. Fuck the football kid though, he's an asshole"
20731,LOVE THIS GAME!!!!
20732,cool
20733,Farming- All I have to say-
20734,Absolutely classic farm life sim. Concerned Ape is a genius. Can't recommend this game enough.
20735,very fun and cool
20736,"I've definitely played this game more on my Switch than here, but I love it, though honestly less so for the farm (though I do enjoy that very much) and more so for everything else, exploring, learning new things and seeing new areas is more my area for this game.
Many different ways to play it, so good for multiple audiences.
Also you buy it here, you sohuld 100% try out some of the mods, makes the game 10x better, which is saying something already."
20737,"very good game
"
20738,a very good game! a super fun and a cooporitave game to play with friends.
20739,accidentally left this running overnight  but im obsessed
20740,i liked it.
20741,"a friend of mine bought it for me without consent, 10/10"
20742,"Love, love, love this game."
20743,super cute and fun! really helps me relax when i'm in a bad mood (:
20744,
20745,cows exist here
20746,"Such a classic, you already know it's good! There's something so special and nostalgic about this game, although I think I prefer the switch version to PC. You really can't go wrong with Stardew, you won't regret it, and you probably don't even need to be reading reviews, haha. 10/10"
20747,"good game jajaj
"
20748,You know what this game is. Just get it.
20749,sussy
20750,"Mostr relaxing game I've ever played. Once I bought it, I could not stop playing. Just everything you could ask for out of a 2D farm role playing game. Story is cool and guiding without being too annoying and controlling over your gameplay. Only complaint is the tips and small things that really accelerate your progress are quite hard to find, and playing the game with a friend who's already played was helpful--but I guess that'as sort of how they wanted the game to be. 10/10"
20751,"great simple enjoyable peaceful game
"
20752,Its mind numbingly good :)
20753,this game took atleast 460 hours of my life and I dont regret single second.
20754,bkdh
20755,yes
20756,"ive played this game for a few years now, it was introduced by my brother who was obsessed with it. adding mods to it can also be very fun ill never get tired of this game"
20757,Farm?
20758,honestly there aren't too many games that I take the time to review. but this game is really fun. I genuinely enjoy playing this game.
20759,It's a better alternative to crack.... I think...
20760,is good. buy game u wil has no regerts. music very nice
20761,"Amazing game, super fun. You can really play this game however you want. You can approach it as a relaxed and peaceful farming game, or an exciting PVE game. You can speed run completion, or slowly and casually progress. I'd recommend this game to literally everyone"
20762,ME LIKEY THIS GAME
20763,comfort game where i can smooch sebastian and abigail
20764,dog grew up and became ugly.. other than that very lovely game
20765,This game is so fun! I have played hours and hours of this game and I never get tired of it!
20766,"This is probably one of the funnest farming sims I have ever played. It's not just a farming sim really, it's so much more than that and has a lot more depth to it than other farming sims I have ever played, even Harvest Moon. I truly love this game and all of the passion and love that went into it, and I will always recommend this game to anyone who loved Harvest Moon or Terraria."
20767,gr8
20768,nice
20769,Simple lighthearted fun where you build farm and explore the world before you
20770,"There's so much to do in Stardew, I feel like I'll never get bored of playing it. There are so many different paths to take and so many different things to complete. It has been so much fun and I would recommend this to anybody looking to enjoy their time."
20771,Stardew Valley is my comfort game. Sometimes I like starting a new game because running away from the city to work a farm sounds so idyllic (too bad real life farms wouldn't be so easy). The music is also very calming and cute. It's really fun to mod as well.
20772,"I don't necessarily have a lot of time on this game yet, but I can say that what I've played so far feels fantastic. Its calming and has great music. its a bit of a social sim with the npcs that live around town all with their own schedules they follow, and it makes the town just feel alive. There's just something here for everyone to enjoy. I have so much left to see as im only in summer year 1. It's $15. get it. From what I've read about the developer hes an AWESOME person."
20773,It's a very nice comfort game <3 i recommend it to everyone :D
20774,amazing gay farming game
20775,love love love this game and with mods the ways to play are endless.  so relaxing and fun
20776,This game is addictive!
20777,"love it
"
20778,It's fun.
20779,Junimo Hut
20780,"Absolutely my favorite game ever! The soundtrack is calming, the storylines are very well written and it is just a whole lot of fun!"

funny"
20788,mm fishing
20789,good
20790,"Impressive, I prefer Stardew when I compare with Harvest moon, there are a lot of event, the large map, a lot of skill to drill.
I take almost whole day to play it without bored."
20791,"shane and harvey made me cry ugly tears

10/10 i really needed that"
20792,"Cute, charming game to play when you want to unwind from blasting aliens and people in the face.
"
20793,relaxing game
20794,"If you are a person that really enjoys farming RPGs like Harvest Moon. Then this is truly Harvest Moon with an upgrade. The townsfolk , the story, etc. Its just overall an amazing game with so much content you could never get tired of."
20795,i like dirt
20796,better than 8bitmmo
20797,i've loved this game from affar for so long and i fell in love with it because its so calming you really can't go wrong with it there's just something that feels rather home like with it its just so familiar but in a good way my expectations were exceeded when i got the game as i was able to run it on my laptop that had an intel celeron so i definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice cozy game to buy
20798,This game is the perfect thing to play with your friend on a chill summer night with some rain in the background and the tv playing cartoons you can watch while you fish and farm your pixelated life away.
20799,"A fun game to play offline
Quite a poggers game
Will play again"
20800,very fun and relaxing :)
20801,I can't stop. Send help.

20811,FARM
20812,"one of the best games I have ever played. It is has all of the best parts of minecraft and animal crossing combined into one 8-bit looking game. it has lore, it has farming, it has mining. 10/10 would recommend."
20813,"Perfect game. 
You can have a pet chicken, to me that's awesome."
20814,amazn
20815,game
20816,"this game is everything I want in life, to have a cat on a farm and to have every eligible person within a 10 mile radius to be violently in love with me. Also Harvey is hot and sexy and hot. Screw Pierre and Lewis. I want Willy to be my father."
20817,set ur farm ablaze
20818,"So wholesome, Still in disbelief this was made by one person, 10/10. Any person that wouldn't recommend this game, should see a therapist to understand why they hate their lives."
20819,good
20820,awesome game that allows you to date the whole town.
20821,100% deserves the hype.
20822,Best game
20823,"This game is not only relaxing but it is fun and it does get your mind working. I love the art style and how well the story is, there is so many puzzles and secrets in the game I still haven't found all of them and I'm 593 hours into the game! This game is great also because if you get bored with it you can just save to another day and hop back on when ever you need or want to. I love it <3"
20824,game good
20825,"this game is good

20826,This is the first video game I have ever played and I am hooked. Very fun to play.
20827,"i have over a thousand hours on switch of this game before moving to pc, where i expect to play thousands of more hours."
20828,its okay. i dont play it too much.
20829,its good i like
20830,ta bn chido
20831,"Eh, it's good."
20832,"Very relaxing, charming and addictive. I've been a fan of Harvest Moon but Stardew Valley blows it out of the water in every way. The music is too good, so many incredible tracks that leave you wanting more. Characters are interesting and quirky. I can't count all the times this game has made me smile. Love the pixel art and style, so pleasant to the eyes. I'm unable get over how only one guy developed the game all by himself, just incredible. Some downsides are that the time passes too quick and I feel like it could use better rewards for completing community bundles. After 200 hours I'm still enjoying and haven't even discovered everything yet. Almost a perfect game. 9.5/10"
20833,yes nice  fun  yea yea yea yea yea yea
20834,its a good game for the girls gays and theys
20835,------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20836,i love farming
20837,Simple but fun! Multiplayer with a host can be buggy but still worth it!
20838,"SDV is a cute and cozy farm sim. There's some lore, a fishing game, cooking, and you can collect artefacts as well as romance characters. Mods are optional, without them, it's still a good and complete game... but SDV expanded takes a 7/10 game up to 10/10 (for me, at least)."
20839,cute
20840,"One of my favorite cozy games. I recommend keeping the wiki on hand if you're new to Stardew, but this game is incredible and so unbelievably fun."
20841,great game good replay value and lots of Developer-supported mods
20842,tem queijo
20843,"It's literally Stardew Valley you cannot go wrong with this game, don't be afraid to use the wiki though 'cause that's a lifesaver"
20844,"Stardew Valley is my ""happy place"" game. The Valley is a peaceful location to spend a few days at the end of a stressful irl day. People are nice to you there. It is easy to play, and there are plenty of achievements. It re-plays well. The island in the 1.5 update is a fun addition."
20845,"It has a fishing minigame, instant 10/10"
20846,
20847,GOOD
20848,"It's a simple game, but has a lot of depth and detail. The mods are also amazing and just add to the overall feel the game has. I have played countless hours on here, plus a lot more on my Switch. It's a game you always end up coming back to."
20849,I started at noon  and ended noon the next day
20850,Just the greatest
20851,"Amazing game, really fun to build your own farm and raise a family. If you have not played please PLEASE buy it RIGHT NOW!"
20852,My favorite computer game <3
20853,tastee
20854,"this game is fun
"
20855,game gud
20856,"This is one of those games that you MUST have in your Steam library. Great game with a lot of replay value. Very fun with friends. If you want a chill game to distract you for a couple of minutes you'll love this game. If you're one of those people who obsess over finding the optimal strategies to progress as soon as possible, you'll love this game as well. Definitely worth buying."
20857,"its a great casual game, Love coming home after a long days work to relax and play some Stardew Valley"
20858,its just the best farming sim I've ever played
20859,love it i would say probably for 13 year olds and older because its when i actually started enjoying the game but you can play it younger just you might not enjoy it if you were younger
20860,Its such a adorable game
20861,"One of the best games I have played in a long time. This game will make you forget you have a life outside of your PC. You will be so obsessed farming and defeating monsters in the mines that your woes will literally sink out of your mind. You will be too busy giving gifts to the NPC's to get unique dialogue and then be disappointed when you pass out at 2am and lose money! But,  if you want a game that you can decorate, can make friends, can farm, can fight, can travel, can grind, this is 100% your game. 
A plus? It is also multiplayer so you can drag your friends down a deep, dark pit of your new obsession: Stardew Valley.

 It is so well worth the 14.99 and sometimes it goes on sale for 9.99 or cheaper. As much as I love discounted games, I would pay full price over and over again for this game. 
There are minimal bugs or crashes I have ever encountered and for ConcernedApe being a one man developer, his work is astonishing to say the least."
20862,"All around great, near flawless game."
20863,Stardew Valley allows the player to live their life however they choose. Want to help colorful apple people? You got it! Wanna give in to corporations? You can do that too! Countless hours of endless fun and a lot of amazing content.
20864,"Ive played this game for daaaaaays and i've never gotten tired of it, i was never one for farming sims but Stardew truly has me addicted. I'd recommend this game to anyone who's into slow gameplay tho, its a game thats best if you go slow with it and experience it rather than bust on through to finish it, but heye thats up to you lol"
20865,I can recommend fishing
20866,So much fun
20867,"It took a few hours to get fully into it, but once I got a handle on the gameplay, I adore this game. Super fun character design. Low stakes but engaging goals. There are a lot of ways to make it personally work for you within the bounds of the game itself. I know I'm very late to the game, but I can confirm it's still a good time."
20868,sexy
20869,"Really chill game, easy to pick up and play a single day every now and then if you don't want to play for long, unique characters, great customization, lots to do."
20870,"It's a cute survival game, a bit like animal crossing, but with more story. It is very time consuming and relaxing."
20871,Is gud
20872,it good
20873,so many women and men (bisexual)
20874,Brilliant and relaxing  10/10
20875,"Great game. It has adventure, farming, fishing and overall fun all!"
20876,fun
20877,An escape from reality BAYBEE
20878,"its like if Clarkson's Farm was a game

fun"
20879,"such a fun game to play with friends, really addictive"
20880,xfbgxfthrfhzthzftrh
20881,AMAZEBALLS
20882,Love this game. I find it so comforting. Whenever my day was too overwhelming i log on and play for hours and hours. I've married most everyone and completed a lot of the in-game achievements. 100% reccomend this game for anyone who enjoys farming simulators.
20883,Really good casual game! It's relaxing and fun. You don't need to hurry and try to do everything you need in the first year. Play in your time.
20884,best fishing simulator ever
20885,"At the first moment, I was unsure if I should buy this game. After I bought it I had to admit that is a really good game and you will spend a good amount of time playing. Worth buying it!!"
20886,great game
20887,"stardew is such an addicting game once you find your play style. If you love mods, get tons of mods! If you like the roleplay side of it (making friends and significant others) do that! If you like the farming and taking care of animals, make your farm compatible with that. Those who enjoy an AMAZING and chill soundtrack will love listening to it as they design their dream farm. Then, there are those who love completing the community centre, the remixed bundles or the normal bundles. This game is so funnnn. Once you find out what works for you in this game you will love it. After 250 hours, I can say that i enjoy every aspect of this game and I am yet to finish total perfection."
20888,yes
20889,gud 7/10
20890,nice
20891,luv this game
20892,very swag but gets boring
20893,"The game is so relaxing and fun! You can play it at your own pace and it's never really game over, there is so much to discover and you can keep playing the same save pretty much without end if you want to. Great replayability too if you prefer to start over."
20894,it satisfy my cottagecore life when I need it
20895,"One dude made this game? I can't believe how much attention to detail there is, how satisfying all aspects of the game play are and the general good vibes this game provides

One man puts to shame 95% of the large scale developers who could never fathom doing updates so consistently with no extra charge for so long. 

One man has made a game that my ex-wife loves (She hates almost everything I love), my 6 year old son loves, and my gf loves. 

To Concerned Ape, all men die but this gem you have made will live on as a legacy you could truly be proud of. You should feel so very proud and satisfied with this game."
20896,yes
20897,Relaxing fun game. Lots of missions and interesting twists.
20898,"Literally my favorite game! Its got something for everyone, fishing, combat, farming, relationship building, etc.... I always find my way back to this game after a stressful day or after playing something scary to calm my  nerves lol. Definitely worth the buy!"
20899,Nice and relaxing

20920,This game is probably one of the most relaxing games I've ever played. That being said-- HOURS can pass by without you realizing it. If you have any important business to take care of... do it first THEN- play this game! LOL 10/10
20921,Really fun little game that my friend bought me for Christmas and I have been addicted to it ever since. 10/10 would recommend playing.
20922,a must play for anyone who grew up with Harvest Moon. This is an anxiety reliever and enjoyable experience all around!
20923,Its a really cool and fun game I like to play when I get done annihilating people in People Playground. People Playground is also a HELLA fun game and you all should check it out.
20924,Nice chill game

20926,good

20933,i love this game
20934,"Love it. Do you like Harvest Moon games? Get it. Do you like Farming Games? Get it. Do you like games with community building, dating, discoverable areas, easter eggs, mini-games, decorating, mining, fishing, talking, walking, cooking, pets, taking down capitalism, joining capitalism, dead grandfathers, multiplayer, and going into people's bedrooms when they're not home? Get it. Have you been thinking about getting this game? Get it."
20935,Its like Harvest Moon but better.
20936,"moo
"
20937,this game is really cute and i don't usually enjoy games like this but i think its fun. I don't know a whole lot about it tbh but there's so much to explore and so  much you can do and its just cool.
20938,Peaceful game.

20966,"I like this game better with friends, but it is a great game! So many little details to discover! Clearly a passion project. :) The art style is also adorable! The farm animals make me absurdly happy. 
Well worth it. 
I also have it on the switch, but controls are better on PC in my opinion."
20967,Great game with a creator who obviously loves the project and its fans. Can't wait for the next game and any future updates to this one

20972,"it's really good if you know what you're doing, but still fun either way and a calming game to play when you're bored/stressed."
20973,love this game. i have played on both switch and pc. i can say i love it on both but pc is definitely better. would recommend this game to anyone x

20975,"This game makes me happy.

1: No microtransactions, no paid DLC, no nothing. Just a very affordable sum for a long-lasting, fully functional game.
2: Enjoyable, laid-back gameplay. A pretty clear goal to complete, and much to do after doing so if you're in the mood.
3: Chill atmosphere, pretty art, great music, good writing.

No game is perfect, but we could use a whole lot more games like Stardew Valley. This game is special."
20976,Bought this game not knowing what to expect. After 300+  hours  I can honestly say this is one  of my favorites.
20977,Such a cute game and very relaxing
20978,"A great cozy game that is pretty much what it says on the tin. My favorite part of this game is that you can experience the entire game while playing with up to three of your friends with no changes or downsides. I think this game far surpasses Animal Crossing for what that's worth. I'm usually not a big fan of these farm-life sims, but Stardew Valley proves to be an actually fun game on top of a relaxing game. If you like this game, I would also suggest Rune Factory 4."
20979,Love it!

20982,"A masterpiece. A must play. A must buy. Stunning, heart warming, wholesome, addicting, gorgeous music and graphics. You can tell how much heart and soul has been put into this game. A game to play when your sad or happy. It is so relaxing and calming. 10/10"
20983,I bought Stardew as my rebound from animal crossing when I realised I no longer had a Switch but that rebound is now my full time lover and my favourite comfy game <3

21000,yes to hot milfs
21001,"I like it a lot, but it does get a little tedious eventually. 

Also please someone take this away from me, seriously I've now played more hours in stardew valley than dark souls III, my favorite game of all time, I can't handle it, someone stop me :("
21002,farm
21003,"I 100% recommend this game to everyone. Even if you are not a fan of a farming or life sim game, there is just something for everyone.
The art style is charming to me(though I changed some female portraits to make them more attractive). You can play it over a long period and still have an objective set for tomorrow, or you could play a short period each time. It's entirely up to you.
the game offers you so much freedom while it also does an outstanding job at making you the player entertaining while playing. (not when I die in the mine by mistake and didn't bring food and have to restarted, not fun)"
21004,"real good game to play alone o r with ur friends, great to relax and have fun."
21005,emo bisexual struggles to pick Sebastian or Sophia in their new Stardew Valley save: IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGE
21006,"This game is what I have taken to calling, ""The Millennial Fantasy"". 

It allows you to live a simple life in a country town, have a house of your own, a reliable and stable income, great social life, ability to build a family without crippling debt, and is generally full of good vibes. 

To put it simply, This game is like life but with all the crappy stuff taken out, leaving nothing but good vibes and a great time. 

You can even play it with friends too. 

I wish more games were like this. It's legitimately refreshing."
21007,"Good game, ignore the hours I left it on for week"
21008,"no need for other games after this, or a life"
21009,"Endless Gameplay, reached year 3 in 140 hours of gametime and yet i didn't get a single prismatic shard yet. fun for killing time in the couch,"

21011,idk the chickens are pretty cute i guess
21012,"there are tons of mods available, you can't ask for more"
21013,"I always look forward into getting home from work and play this game. Its relaxing, mellow and with just the right amount of frustration once you advance forward to the desert cave. The only thing I dislike is the fishing mechanism (Make sure to press ""x"" on your keyboard instead of mouse if youre using PC). Other than that its an awesome game if you need something to take your mind off of stressful day. :)

*Edit: Fishing mechanism gets way easier after you get to level 2. You just need to bear with the uncontrollable fishing hook bar for the first level. If you buy trout soup, it may make fishing a little bit tolerable on the first level."
21014,good
21015,u can have sex
21016,"i bought the game so that i could play with my sister. I thought since it was a farming game, it would be boring. but it turned out to be pretty fun! good game, 7.993/10 also babys constantly clip through to the 4th dimension"
21017,"good
"
21018,"super fun game, so many things to do, explore, make and meet. definently recommend"
21019,RLY FUN AND CALMING
21020,"Love this game, very peaceful and takes you out of reality and there is a lot to do as well. Farming, Mining and fighting are just a few. You can follow the missions and stuff that the other people give but it is not necessary to progress through the game."
21021,"When I first saw this game I thought it might be kind of similar to the game 'Rune Factory: Frontier' which I had played on the Wii.  I've eagerly awaited a port for PC but as of yet it currently can only be played on PC using an emulator.  Stardew Valley gave off some very similar vibes though so I thought maybe it might be close enough to sort of fill that same gap.

The game starts out simple enough, your grandfather left you a farm and you need to work to repair it and get it up and running again.  You chop logs, break rocks, till soil, plant seeds and harvest your crops.  There's a  lot of room to play around with your farm and where you want to place things.  There's also a foraging aspect which helps encourage exploration of your surroundings too.  The game is more than just a farming sim though, it also has RPG elements and you can battle monsters in the mines that in turn drop loot you can use or sell.  In addition to that it has some adventure game aspects such quests and some fairly light puzzles.  You can date and marry certain people in the town and even have two kids.  Later in the game you can even forge your own weapons and equipment and add specific power-ups to them.

I grew up on pixel graphics so I found the graphics to be somewhat nostalgic feeling.  The animations are fairly simple and the character sprites very 2D but the characters themselves, not so much.  Each character has a bit of a backstory and unique character traits you get to know as you build friendship points.  At certain levels of friendship you're given the treat of special little cut scenes.  You get to make choices on how you respond to the cut-scenes too.  Sometimes it can help your relationship or hurt it.  This adds quite a bit of story elements to the game.

Part of the beauty of this game is that you can play it in so many ways.  If you just want to have a calm farming experience, growing crops, playing around with aesthetics or optimal functionality in your builds, then you can play it that way.  The music in the game somehow manages a great balance of calming and upbeat.  If you want a little more excitement you can delve deep in the different mines and battle a variety of monsters and collecting and crafting better gear.  If you like adventure then you'll probably want to work on completing quests and solving the puzzles.  If you're more into stories you'll probably enjoy making friends with everyone and exploring their personalities.  Really, there's a little something for everyone and enough content that if you get bored there's something else to try.

In the early game it really feels like completing the community tasks mounts to a climax.  It's easy little goals to attain and strive for but once you finish the community center that's really just the beginning of the game.  You can unlock other mines, a desert, and an Island.  The game is much more expansive than you will first anticipate and it's possible that the developer may release future expansions to bring even more content and explorable areas.  The game does have a sort of ""ending"" in which you'll see a special cut scene but you can keep playing on so the game doesn't ever truly end.  You can also create a new character to play again from the beginning.  There are different farm types that present different challenges and benefits which make for a little replay-ability.

In addition to different maps you can also play this game in co-op mode with friends.  I don't personally like multi-player experiences, I prefer solo adventures, but I do like that if you chose to play this way each character can have their own house and while you can work together, you can also go off and do your own thing.  You aren't limited to the host's farm or experiences and guests can upgrade their cabin, get married, and essentially experience everything the games has to offer.

There are really only two things I disliked about this game.  First, there's the save function, you can only save by going to sleep (or ending the day by falling asleep outside your home/bed or ""dying"" in the mines {you can't actually die you just get beat to within inches of your life apparently}).  Sleeping ends the day and your game progress is saved.  However, I often find that I have to leave my game in the middle of a day when I don't have time or the ability to finish my day or even run to my bed so I can save.  Instead, I had to open the menu, which pauses the game, and then either just leave it running in the foreground or if I had to do something on my computer, let it run in the background till I could get back to the game.  So, for example, at the time of writing this review, Steam has 1,062.9 hours logged playing this game.  However, between my two save files I only have about 509 hours logged in-game.  So, it spent about half the time sitting open in the background on my computer simply because I could hit a save button and continue later.

The second thing I didn't like was the fishing mini-game.  I've played plenty of games that have fishing mini-games in them and they are all similar but all have their own unique flair... this one is the worst fishing mini-game I've ever played.  Maybe other people found it easy but I couldn't get how to catch fish.  There's something to do with patterns and clicking at the right times but I completely failed at it every time.  The only thing that made fishing redeemable was actually a mod that let me skip the mini-game portion.  While I don't necessarily advocate mods, I found the game partially unplayable because of this mini-game and it was really ruining my personal experience with playing the game.  The mod made the game playable and fun again.

Mods are actually one of the things that for some players could be a real plus side to the game.  Stardew Valley has a fairly large modding community with mods for everything from changing the NPC's dialogue avatar to skipping fishing mini-games to adding elevators to creating new expanded areas to explore.  If you find yourself too frustrated with an aspect of the game, there's probably a mod for it.  If you love mods for games you'll love this game.

The last thing I'd like to touch on is the game's achievements.  There's 40 of them which is a fair amount and most will unlock naturally over time with normal gameplay, but there are several collection based achievements that you have to work for.  Many of those require a lot of hours of game play.  For example, if you want to catch all the fish you won't be able to do it unless you fish in every season, some require reaching maximum friendships which can take a lot of time to build, and of course others require you to get a huge sum of money.  Collectible items are gained through RNG drops so even if you do everything right you could be doing it a long time to get those drops you need.  For completionists, like me, that can be very frustrating and it's a big part of why I had to put in about 500 hours to get all the achievements.  It could be a lot less or even more depending on your luck with the RNG.

Overall, this game is a gem, I don't usually recommend games at full retail price, but I'd say this one is actually worth it."
21022,yeah not bad innit
21023,sick
21024,Games good.
21025,"Stardew Valley is the definition of chill. The music, artwork, and even the storyline keep you invested but not to a point that is anxiety-driving. I highly recommend this game to all ages."
21026,I'd give it a perfect 5/7
21027,absolutely one of my favorite games of all time 10/10 recommend
21028,farm
21029,love the game
21030,"I made a long review complaining about the lack of racial diversity, but I'll say this shortly; the dating options on this game are lackluster and deeply melancholic. The relationships you form are inherently materialistic; all you do is hand out gifts like a bank account. Creating personalities and unique interactions will greatly improve the experience. Creating racially diverse NPCs will improve the experience of dating. You date people you are ATTRACTED TO. The NPC interactions are boring and if someone says this doesn't have to depict ""reality"" or ""make a game yourself"" doesn't negate the blatant racism of this game. If I were to ""date"" and engage in the poor lackluster option on this game, I would have to date an NPC, I would not be attracted to if my criteria were anything except ""white"". I would also not gain any main benefits besides the disappointing dialogue and horrendous interactions. If I had to make a game for every sad racist game like this, I would be a multi-million dollar game developer. You did everything right except the bad NPC interactions and deeply disconcerting lack of racial diversity. Sorry for being a Karen, but I just find these aspects of the game laughable how people justify it. Just don't add a dating option if it isn't beneficial and if It directly offends the preferences of its players. I don't find white people romantically attractive, so do something about it, Eric so people would stop being offended by your game. Otherwise, incredible game, you also subconsciously attract racist people, just saw a mod that makes Demetrius white... https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/817/ Good job, Eric. I don't identify with any political party, nor am I an SJW. I just believe in being nice to people. Still going to play the game though, so who really cares what I have to say."
21031,This game is really fun overall to play both on your own and with friends! Calming to play after a long day of work in the real world. Highly recommend if you love chill wholesome quality content.

21058,"It's a great game to sit down and play after a long and tiring day. You're able to do things at a pace you're comfortable with, unlike in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, where you're restricted by time. As someone who's played both, I genuinely prefer Stardew Valley more. Which is surprising, considering I spent around $45 more for the ladder. You don't feel forced to 100% the game immediately, so you can take all the time you need to get settled, get to know the places and appreciate the small details. Definitely consider playing co-op with friends or family. This game perfectly encompasses what a relaxing farming sim should be like: wholesome, unique, and abundant in content so that you never get bored. Everything in this game comes directly from the heart, I can tell. So if you're sitting on whether or not you want to buy it, there are just zero issues all-around. I really can't think of another Steam game more worthy of my $15.

21119,"Outside of Steam's record time, I probably have another 200+ hours on this game on other consoles. This game is now my standard I compare to other farming games like Rune Factory, Story of Seasons (Respectfully very wonderful games too) and Harvest Moon (Who have gone very down hill over the years). To marry any of the marriage candidates is the biggest plus compared to HM. It's very easy on the computer and the soundtrack/sound effects are amazing. It's incredibly fun to play multiplayer too, it makes farming and making gold a lot easier, especially since you don't have to split up your days into just farming and mining, instead you can divide the tasks.

The only real downside is when 2 am hits in game. The fear in your co-farmer's voices as they race for the house and fall asleep on the front porch to be robbed is still pretty funny, especially when you're the one early to bed."

21159,it's fun and reminds me of animal crossing : )
21160,"Fun farming game! If you like animal crossing or hay day then you'll love this game. Fun for 62 hours, but then gets kinda repetitive, but that is just me. Fun with friends too, probably best with friends, but still a really good single player experience so! A lot to do, more than just farming as well, so Yeahhh get this if you are even a bit interested."

It's one of my favorite games ever, I've played it for hundreds of hours on several platforms, and whether you're looking for a game to chill with or one to focus in on and build an empire, this is a great game for it. Top to bottom, one of the best games out there."
21172,i love marrying my bestie!
21173,"This could be called Owen Benjamin: The Game.
When I'm not playing this I'm on Zillow looking for land out in the country by a lake.
VERY addictive. Well worth $15."

21181,One of my fav games!
21182,it's fun and has cute artwork
21183,give my life back
21184,This game is a masterpiece!
21185,good game
21186,"The farm... the farm has changed.
It's no longer about nations, ideologies, or ethnicity. It's an endless series of proxy battles, fought by villagers and animals.
The farm--and it's production of life--has become a well-oiled machine"
21187,"it is cool
"
21188,I can't stop farming.
21189,"Probably one of my favorite games, ive had it for a while now and idk why but steam hasnt counted all my hours on it but oh well. Its really fun and if you get bored of it you can always download mods (all sorts of mods). Definetly worth the money."
21190,god
21191,shits fire
21192,best gam ever
21193,mmmm smells like bacon yep alr
21194,n/a
21195,"This game is so much fun! It's super relaxing and very task orientated. It always feels like your doing something productive when you play. The character art is also amazing as well as the schedule's for all the characters and dialogue. It really feels like you're in a little town, beginning a whole new life away from not only your in-game stressful job but from your real-life stressors as well."
21196,penny is the best wifau

21208,"Wholesome pixel game, best results if planned out, enjoyable nonetheless"
21209,"I love how you can play this game in a very relaxed way, but you can also speed run some and fight baddies. Good game for all play styles and ages"
21210,"I really cannot say much more except that I absolutely love this game. It blows all other farming/dating sims out of the water. I like how the fishing and combat (in the skull cavern specifically) poses a challenge but the rest of this game is a simple concept: run a farm, make friends and rebuild Pelican Town and community centre (or join Joja *shudders*). I could never get sick of this game."
21211,Excellent game.
21212,13/10 love it
21213,it's really relaxing and there's so much to do even though you've maybe played for 50+ hours
21214,10/10 cat was sleeping in my bed after a long day. Miau
21215,.
21216,This game is SO MUCH FUN. It's relaxing and satisfying. If you don't like the farming aspect of the game you can go to the mines to slay monsters and MINE.
21217,haley hot
21218,really chill
21219,"A masterpiece of a farming sim. It somehow incorporates all good activities in a perfect balance. However, the best part, is the party duck glitch on mobile."

21261,"The game play is fun, relaxing, and engaging and the atmosphere created by the visuals, soundtrack, sound design, townsfolk etc., creates a game worth FAR FAR more than $15 Dollars. This game is an Inspiration and an ABSOLUTE STEAL. There is not a bigger bang for your buck on the steam store."

21263,here lies my heart & soul
21264,yes
21265,"At first glance it's just another game, but as the player progresses into the adventures ahead they find an entirely new life; a fun new life to explore full of so many curiosities and hidden secrets.
Words can never be enough to explain this game, but if you're looking for something to escape to like we all do with video games, look no further, this is one adventure you don't want to miss."

She hated it

I'm not regret

10/10 

I wish i could poison her though.."
21270,"ConcernedApe made this singlehandedly, and you couldn't tell at all. This has as much polish as games with tens of thousands of dollars of budget, and only costs $15. Pick it up, you won't regret it."
21271,"Stardew Valley Story is a very good simulation leisure game, worth recommending, you will experience a farmer, miner, fisherman in this game, these occupations sad.
"
21272,"What I like- Fun aspects that give it an rpg/adventure vibe in addition to being a cool 8 bit farming simulator

What I don't like- Pierre. F*** Pierre."
21273,Really fun not gonna lie.

21285,"its so easy to get sucked in, spend 3 hours, im totally not taking this from experience,"
21286,"Quite addicting, I play this literally any chance I get it is so much fun. Even better with mods such as Stardew Valley Expanded."
21287,"This might be one of my favorite farming games to play! It has an excellent story, characters, and plenty of women of course. Getting to know people is a new adventure every time you play this game. I do have some issues with this game though. Progression in this game is very long, so you need to be very dedicated to grinding for maybe even one item. The game can also get very boring sometimes if you do not know how to progress. Otherwise, I recommend this game to players who like long-term gameplay!"
21288,i love this game
21289,"how can you go wrong with a game where you can shoot a homeless guy and then marry the mayors lovers cousin and then call you and him ""related"" and then he gives you all the towns taxes because good drunk boi Shane gave me all the secrets about his ""meetings"" with the shop owners."

21296,"god i love this game. i usually play on my switch, and i have over 400 hours on that platform, but i cant write a review on there so this is the next best thing.

ive played through the game to perfection, and i reached that goal after 200+ hours and 7.5 in game years (reached 100% on summer 2 year 8). great friends and all fish were the hardest goals for me to achieve, but it was a great incentive for me to actually fulfill that aspect of the game, which i normally wouldn't have done. i consider myself a casual player, but i always have big goals, like perfection or completing remixed cc, etc. 

my favorite aspect of these big goals is that i get to make lists, which ive discovered is something i really like doing, and i wouldnt have known that without this game. im currently working on my second perfection save, and im filling a notebook with information that i'll need, such as crafting and cooking recipes. 

this game requires so much effort, but at the same time it's effortless. i love it, and i recommend it to anyone looking for a casual game that also has non-casual aspects"
21297,"This game has consumed 500 hours of my life, please help."

21314,funny farm haha game plant
21315,Heard a lot about it and had to try it out.... I've been playing for about 2 weeks straight and have ignored most of my adult responsibilities so i would say i thoroughly enjoyed this game thus far!
21316,"If I had a computer that ran it well the ENTIRE time I've had this game, my 8 days of playtime would easily be in double digits. This game means a lot to me - it was one of the first things I had on PC and could actually spend time in, and I very often got lost in hours and hours at a time. The moment it opens up and that first song plays, I'm already ecstatic every time, even if I've logged 50 hours in the last two weeks; I'm still so excited. I personally have JUST finished the community center, but even leading up to it for so many hours in different games with myself and other people, it has been beyond fun and such a unique experience every time. Seeing the people grow time and time again is something that will never grow old, and neither will every season and year that goes by."

Crazy to think it was solely developed by only one person, and with next to no coding experience when starting, great job CA!"
21365,"Its a super cozy game, if you want a slow paced farm game that has a story line where you can chose what path you take this is def for you"

There are many ways than just farming, and with mods its hella replayable"
21393,"Game so good I bought it on three different platforms.

My best escape from the stresses of real life. With so much attention to detail, it's almost unbelievable that this was made by one person. What a genius. Everything is so simple, yet elegant and encompassing. I have never played a game of this genre before but it feels nostalgic somehow.

You can choose farming crops, raising animals, growing an orchard, foraging for items, mining, fishing, cultivating friendships, marriage and more. I like that you can move through the game at your own pace. Just when I thought I had done everything, I discovered more. You can even start the game over and build in a different location with new challenges. I love it!!"

21523,"Game is so relaxing and fun to just sit back and chill with, design a farm, build relationships, jsut a relaxing game"
21524,Close to the Harvest Moon game that I always wanted
21525,"i love this game it has a lot of good things about it but, my only complaint is there is no workshop to easily download mods"
21526,"Such a fun Indie Game. Always nice to find something different when all the newer triple AAA games come out bland or unfinished. No, this game right here, full of content. At face, it may just look like a top down farming simulator but, it is much more than that. Not only will you be doing farming, you will also be mining, fishing, foraging and fighting. As you progress, you unlock new items and have a choice between professions. At the Beginning, you have a choice between 7 different farm layouts (with one being more specialised for multiplayer). Each farm has there strengths and weaknesses. 

Now, the core crux of gameplay relies on you having great Planning skills. The goal is to make lots of money to buy certain items, upgrades, more crops, buildings, etc. You also have a goal in mind as you progress: Rebuilding the old community centre in which you need to give certain items to complete its many bundles. Each bundle will provide a unique reward. Completing them will unlock certain benefits, new areas and mechanics. Alternatively, you can buy a Joja Membership, destroy the community centre and pay gold instead of providing certain items. 

Because time moves very fast in Stardew, along with a curfew in which you will get knocked out if you are not in bed by 2am, you need to properly plan your day out.  While I personally found the walking speed to feel a bit slow and the time a bit too fast, I played with it for around 2 seasons and then after that, I got a mod which made my walking speed 50% faster to improve MY personal experience and found it a bit more fair. I still appreciate how the game tells you that you aren't suppose to do every single thing and need to prioritize one or the other. 

Farming is the main method of making money, from planting and harvesting crops, to building coops and barns to house animals. Foraging is required for crafting certain items for the farm, such as wood, tappers and seasonal wild seeds which provide a lot of early game value. Mining is also essential for crafting, finding gems to sell or gift and ores to convert into bars to upgrade your tools. Fishing is recommended for early game and shouldn't be ignored, providing various ways to make fishing easier or your crab pots more valuable. Finally, combat while simple in design is also essential as it is paired with mining. Since monsters are within the mine, you need to defend yourself with either a sword, hammer or dagger. progressing allows for additional food items, rings to boost stats as well as a slime press and incubator to make eggs or raise slimes which sell for a immense value depending on the egg. 

Along with building up your skills, you also need to interact with the many characters with a range of personalities, backstories, events and rewards they will give you If you improve there friendship. Improving friendship mainly involves finding the right gifts to give them. The Game does its best to indicate through dialogue what character loves what, along with a bit of guessing. Fortunately, if your having trouble finding a gift they like or love, the wiki provides all the information you need. In addition, there are ""help wanted"" requests where a certain character will need a particular item and they will pay you and increase friendship. There are also 12 characters in which you have the choice to romance. After reaching 8 hearts on one, there will be an exclusive event and then you can buy a bouquet to make them your girl/boyfriend, As well as a Mermaid's Pendant you can buy on rainy days which will then allow marriage. Spouses can have a chance to cook, water crops, fill up pet bowls, etc. 

There is so many things I've not yet touched one that would make this review too long such as the events, ginger island and much more but for a value of 1$6 AUD, this is well worth the price. This is a game brimmed with content and made with effort in mind, Highly recommended for someone that wants to try something new."
21527,"This is absolutely one of my favorite games and I have sunk so many enjoyable hours into this game. It is full of heart and the multiplayer option makes it even better. Not to mention the replay value of the game is incredible; I have created many farms and loved each one. Highly recommended to anyone who likes zen, peaceful, and lighthearted games. Stardew Valley can't be beat!"

21571,My boyfriend introduced me to this game and we've been playing together nonstop. It's a relaxing game and it's fun to play when you're bored of everything else. I'm not necessarily a huge fan of paper RPG games like this but I've enjoyed it thus far. Good game to play with your partner. :)
21572,Its a good game and i recommend it to anyone who likes farming games and relaxing games.
21573,One of the most wonderful pieces of art and entertainment ever made.
21574,Incredibly addicting and really fun
21575,"i first bought this game on switch after seeing some youtube videos of people playing and i instantly fell in love. after a few dozen or so hours on the switch i decided to buy it on pc. i was weary that i wouldnt want to start a brand new game, that i would get bored, but that didn’t happen. 
everything about this game is incredible. the graphics are simply yet convey everything they need to, the story is something i feel everyone can relate to, and the characters all have personality and heart. this game also never seems to end. with the “new” late game content added it truly gives the game countless more hours and playtime. i’m at 140 hours and ive still yet to “finish” a game. 
i couldn’t recommend this game enough. if you are stressed and need something to play to forget the realities of life, buy this game. i wish i could forget it so i rediscover it again."
21576,"It is a very relaxing, cute, and fun game to play!!"
21577,"Pure Farming game with a bit of story and occasional romance, Really nice immersion, atmosphere and Art style all done by One person!!! Well done ConcernedApe.

Grab this game on sale or without it's worth it either way."
21578,a great chill game
21579,I find something new practically every save. Don't look stuff up for the first time and you will enjoy it that much more. What a game.
21580,its fun
21581,"Absolutely adore this game. There's so much to do and explore with a seemingly never-ending list of quests and personal goals. It looks great, sounds great, is beautifully written, and runs well. Recently, though, I've been having issues where it struggles to open and to connect. Takes anywhere from 2 to 20 minutes to open, then another 2 to 40 minutes to connect to my friend's game (he's been hosting our world). Not sure if this is a game issue, steam issue, or computer issue, but it's the only steam game I've ever had this problem with. All that said, I love this game so much that I wish I could play it every day, and I think it's a game almost everyone would enjoy. Relaxing because it's engaging with a no stress story line."
21582,.
21583,"Adam McIlwee (born March 11, 1989), better known by his stage name Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, is a singer-songwriter and producer from Scranton, Pennsylvania. He is a member of emo-rap collective GOTHBOICLIQUE, super-group Misery Club, duo Coward and band Pay For Pain. He is also a former member of emo-band Tigers Jaw and rap collective Thraxxhouse.

McIlwee started playing guitar at 13 and around that time he founded his first band, Closed Mouth.
During his middle school years, he played in different punk and ska bands (Green Chair, Bad Seed, and Captain, We’re Sinking, among others) along his friend Ben Walsh, but they were always kicked out.

In 2005 Adam and Ben formed emo band Tigers Jaw, which he left in 2013 to pursue a solo project. Wicca Phase Springs Eternal originally started as an electronic project, but once he started getting beats from producers he switched to emo/cloud-rap music.

His stage name Wicca Phase Springs Eternal was suggested him by visual artist Caroline Bren he knew on Tumblr. He emailed her “what do I call this project?”, and she just said “Wicca Phase Springs Eternal.” According to a Reddit user, the name has roots in the phrase “Hope springs eternal [in the human beast,]” which essentially means that hope is forever-lasting. When we replace “Hope” with “Wicca phase”, it can be interpreted to mean that the wicca phase in one’s life is forever-lasting.
Wicca is a pre-christian religion that in simple terms is focused on the supernatural and black magic and stuff. Followers of this “religion” inhere in nature and that emphasizes ritual observance of seasonal and life cycles, hence “springs eternal”.

Some of his musical influences are Phil Elverum, Bright Eyes, Bob Dylan, Lil B, Clams Casino, and Bonnie “Prince” Billy."

21611,i feel bad for buying this on sale 10/10 its good
21612,"This game is DEEP! For those of you that like Minecraft and Animal Crossing, there is a ton of content for you. The storyline is complicated and rewarding. The gameplay is relaxed if you so choose (taking care of animals, planting crops, etc.). It is also harrowing and challenging if you wish (mining the deep with a bunch of monsters to fight, stepping up to the various seasonal tasks and getting to bed on time!). Play for some farm-sim chill time and/or push yourself to reach Perfection. All in all, an absolute gem!"

21708,"i love stardew valley so much. at the beginning of the pandemic, my two best friends introduced me to the game. it took me some time to get used to the mechanics, but a love had blossomed between game and person. 2 years later. i've clocked in 500+ hours. i have fallen in love with all the characters, even the hard to love ones. theres so much to do in the game. there are days where you wont get anything done, but there are also days where there is so much to do. you wont get everything done! the game is just so relaxing and has helped me thru some bad times. the pandemic was rough on my mental health, but all the solo runs and the multiplayer farms have brought me so many memories. play this game!!!!!! you will never regret it."

21831,"ive only played for 2 months(i have this game on other platforms)and i love it,i just got it on mac yesterday and 
its great."
21832,"Stardew Valley is just as fun to watch as it is to play. I watched my friend play for years before I decided to buy it myself. I immediately was asking all sorts of questions on ""how"". The BEST advice I was given is TAKE YOUR TIME and DO NOT CHEAT! It truly does take away special moments and quirks in the game if you look too far into the game. Stardew Wiki was really helpful without giving too much away about the ""achievements"" of the game. It also notifies you of any SPOILER alerts, which I appreciated. I can't wait to see how far this game goes. Everytime I think I've unlocked everything, something else exciting happens and continues the game even further! It's such an amazing game."
21833,"Don't play it! You'll just end up sucked in into Stardew, you'll never want to leave ;-)"

21893,"I am Karl Marx. Despite having to buy this game under Capitalism, I have found much enjoyment within it. Playing as myself but in a digital world, I have found my utopia. I am able to work, not because I have to, but because I [i] want [/i] to. No more forced labor! Just enjoyment! Hooray! It is truly amazing and I think developed worlds should take notes. Playing this game, I do not feel alienated! Not only because there are non playable characters that will talk to me, but it is also multiplayer! I am able to have my friends join me in utopia!"

21900,Stardew Valley more like Start playing this game
21901,Some homeless guy touched me in a bath house 3/10
21902,"Stardew Valley is a wonderfully made game that you can immerse yourself in a calm and relaxed game session of farming, fishing, foraging and socializing. I love to play with friends on co-op. In one weekend, myself and two other friends were able to get through an entire year of fun.
Getting to know the villagers and see how they grow is an experience in yourself- without knowing this entire game was made by one man alone. Then it's just impressive how each character has development as they get to know the Farmer. Having that kind of impact on the community is rewarding. Even if it's just a game.
I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time. And I'd be impressed myself if you've 100% this game with the amount of content it has."
21903,great game the sounds is amazing

21942,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

21948,"Amazing game! Also, USE THE WIKI"
21949,A really cute and laid back game that can be made even more expansive with the help of a few mods. I'd absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes some nice casual games.
21950,This is one of the best farming game I have played and I have been playing them since Back to Nature was released on the original Play station. I bought it on steam and them on my PS4 and my switch to play on the go.  I love everything about the game but there are a few areas I feel lacking but nothing that breaks the game. I would love to see this developer makes a stardew two with a village builder aspect.
21951,"Pretty fun, I really enjoy the farming and fishing aspects of the game as well as the romance parts too"
21952,Such a calming and relaxing game but with seemingly endless things to do. I have played this game for countless hours across multiple platforms. This game has easily become my comfort game and my go to when I'm extra stressed or depressed. ConcernedApe is the man and I will absolutely be trying out any future games he develops.
21953,"Features
Turn your overgrown field into a lively farm! Raise animals, grow crops, start an orchard, craft useful machines, and more! You'll have plenty of space to create the farm of your dreams.

4 Player Farming! Invite 1-3 players to join you in the valley online! Players can work together to build a thriving farm, share resources, and improve the local community. As more hands are better than one, players have the option to scale profit margin on produce sold for a more challenging experience.

Improve your skills over time. As you make your way from a struggling greenhorn to a master farmer, you'll level up in 5 different areas: farming, mining, combat, fishing, and foraging. As you progress, you'll learn new cooking and crafting recipes, unlock new areas to explore, and customize your skills by choosing from a variety of professions."

21960,"team sebastion, duh"
21961,"Oliver Twist is a novel written by Charles Dickens (1812-1870), a man who had a difficult life. He had worked since he was a child and he had no money. He gave Oliver , the protagonist, those characteristics.

The story is about a child, whose mother had died, that was sent to a workhouse. Oliver was an innocent and pure boy. When he was eleven, he was tried to be sold from the workhouse as an apprentice, but he escaped from there. In his way to London, he met a boy called Artful Dodger and then ended up with Fagin, the leader of a gang of thieves, who taught children how to steal.

Luckily, Oliver also found people who took good care of him and helped him with some problems he had had.

In my opinion, the novel is very entertaining and it makes you want to read more.   I liked the fact that Fagin and Sikes tried to change Oliver, but he continued to be an innocent good boy.

My favourite character is Mr. Brownlow, who took care of Oliver and loved him despite the things he had done, and his past; and my favourite part is when he is accused of a robbery he hadn’t committed and Mr. Brownlow took him to his house because he was sick. I liked the end , and I wouldn’t change anything in the book."
21962,Game randomly stutters so bad you can't fish walk or mine. Tried it without SMAPI and other mods but the game still hangs which is really disappointing
21963,good game
21964,love everything good
21965,"If you love games like Animal Crossing New Horizon, this is the game for you! There's a lot of quests to make you feel invested into the story and also the freedom to decorate and create your own farm and stories! There's so many things to be discovered in Stardew Valley with friends or even single player!"
21966,adorable game that i always return to <3
21967,this is an amazing game
21968,Very enjoyable. Looks nice and the gameplay is very fun
21969,Very epic

21971,"Honestly 10/10 recommend. Great game, especially considering it was built by only one guy. There are so many reviews already, I am sure you have seen all the pro's and con's there are to consider. The only thing you should consider is whether this type of game fits you as a gamer. If yes; definitely buy, if no; then don't (mister obvious over here).

My point; the game is well made. From the cute-ass art to the music, to basically every game mechanic; I love it. So to me, that's not something worth discussing. Anyone could like it, just depends on taste. Also, price is pretty low, so if you have the funds and are hesitating, just go for it. You probably won't regret it."
21972,ben
21973,i have mastered the art of the Blueberry stock market 10/10 would reccomend
21974,"I love this game for so many reasons.

I suffer from night panic attacks and just sitting around waiting for my medication to calm my racing heart is often agonizing.  Then I found Stardew Valley.  It distracts me without being overly stimulating like so many other games I play and has helped me beyond measure.

I admit at first glance I scoffed at the graphics and figured it was just another one of those 'farming sims'  - but when I really started playing I was instantly enchanted.  The story of Stardew Valley is so much richer and deeper than what's seen on the surface.  The townsfolk aren't just fixed NPCs that you interact with.  They have routines - lives if you will - and their dialogue reflect their likes, dislikes and dreams.  The fact that some have reflections of real-world problems and you can influence their lives makes them that much more relatable.  Growing and managing a farm is only part of the journey in Stardew Valley.

This game is beautifully crafted and you can tell the developer put his heart and soul into it.

The only downsides I find is the fishing mini game (mini games in games are the bane of my existence) and that my 'kids' never grow up and help on the farm. However, I don't mind because of all the positives the rest of the game provides.  

I highly recommend Stardew Valley to anyone seeing a unique and rich gaming experience in a calming and beautiful atmosphere.

10/10"
21975,I miss 1 cooking show and have to wait an entire year to progress. nice!
21976,One of the best games I've played so far!
21977,This game is fun to play with friends
21978,"I really like the characters and story in the game, the visuals i adore and the gameplay is pleasant.
"
21979,i love this game so violently. its such a cute little game with so much content and i would commit murder for it.
21980,you haven't played this game already? ya stupid
21981,"On the surface ""Stardew Valley"" looks like a very simple game with it's cute pixel art.
kinda like a nice, pretty, calm, relaxing pond...
until you step your toe into the waters edge and millions of tiny writhing hands surge out to grab your feet and pull you into the bottomless depths.
In short, this game is super deep past the simple overcoat. And crafted beautifully, your own gameplay experience will be immersive, enjoyable, aggravating (in a masochistic ""wow this is great!"" way), and most incredibly-
Humane, with all its flaws and imperfections. I personally wouldn't have it any other way.
Also did I mention that you'll be on the game's wiki the half the time? (all the time)
pro tip: become a hoarder in game uwu"
21982,"This game is absolutely amazing
"
21983,"A peaceful game where you learn to live off of the land with interesting characters in the village near your farm. You can mine, fight monsters, gain rare gems and artifacts, build relationships, get married and have children, grow crops, forage, and even more. Truly a very addictive game if you're a chill kind of person looking to relax but keep your mind occupied at the same time. I love it!"
21984,"has fishing

what more could you possibly ask for"
21985,"me like this

21997,gud
21998,The game is prob the best I ever played and everyone else I got to play it enjoyed it just as much as I did. Best $15 I ever spent don't hesitate if you're on the fence about it

22007,YA PRETTY GOOD. WISH THERE WAS PVP THO. IF YOU LIKE FARMING GO FOR IT. IF YOU LIKE MINING GO FOR IT!
22008,best second life you'll get
22009,"This game is truly one of the best games I have ever played. When I bought this game a few years ago, I had no idea how much joy I would get out of it (especially for the price). I am always finding new things to do, fun play styles to test out, and hidden secrets to discover. The NPC's are utterly delightful. The art style is adorable, the music is so calming (I even listen to it when I'm not playing, that's how calming it is). I couldn't recommend this game enough. After a difficult day at work/school, there's nothing better than coming home and playing some Stardew Valley <3"
22010,"very chill,"
22011,pretty fun good game gg
22012,"9.5/10

Although my play time is 5 hours on steam (at the time of this review 5/1/22) I have played Stardew valley for hundreds of hours on other platforms. After playing this game for around a year (on other platforms) I can say, that yes Stardew valley is worth the money. Considering that the game is only 15 dollars it is a great bargain of a game. The main reason why I like Stardew valley is that the game appeals to multiple different playing styles. You want to only talk to the villagers and not focus on money? You can go ahead. You only want to focus on profits and making crazy money? You absolutely can. You want to do nothing for three years to piss off the reason why you went there? You can.

The reason why this game is not a 10/10 is because it can be challenging to new players. The grinding times, using a wiki constantly, feeling overwhelmed. But when you get learn the game and overcome the challenges the game gives you, it is REWARDING as hell. 

Summary : Whether you buy the game and do not play it again, it is still worth it because when you really get into the game it is one of the most rewarding addicting and rich games out right now. Hours of endless content, Freedom to play how you want, and just being fun all around makes Stardew valley worth it. I forgot to mention but there is an active and supportive community that make tons and tons of incredible mods that only help the game feel like a better game unlike some other games."
22013,its a sandbox farming game. whats not to love?
22014,slaps
22015,u cant fkin marry victor this game is a LOAD of shit
22016,This game is insanly fun I've spent so much time and effort just on one game.
22017,FUN
22018,fun
22019,"DO you like farming crops? No? Do you like mining and killing monsters? No? Do you like taking care of animals? No? Do you like fishing? No? Do you like foraging and collecting resources a la Minecraft? No? Do you like meeting new people and marrying them? No? Do you like building a homestead and decorating your own space? No? Then you probably won't like this game. Otherwise, just buy it. The writing is great. The music is fantastic. Oh, and if you're blind, you can make it accessible with the Stardew Access Mod. Happy farming!"
22020,Good to play with friends. Actually played over 40 hours of this but it's not synced with steam.
22021,"fun farming game, make farming simulator look like gardening

22091,"I've picked up the game only a few weeks ago and haven't been able to let it go since (I'm over 200 hours of play now and have unlocked 29/40 achievements). This is adicting but also a very big help when you're struggling with depression and being overwhelmed by the world. Some NPC might have issues you're struggling with yourself (alcoholism, depression, etc.) but it is still a wholesome and fun-loving experience (despite the darker sides to the story).

I can't wait to play ConcernedApe's next game, Haunted Chocolatier, as this guy totally gets what a game is supposed to be first and foremost: great fun!"
22092,"Farming & Dating with great story line.
All other farming game should study from Stardew ♥ & Portia too"

22094,Is fantastic
22095,farming
22096,I really love this game. My only complaint is I wish there was a way to slow down the game time.
22097,"I bought this game before it came out and found that I had spent waaayyy too many hours playing it.  I like that it's cultured in western aspects as most games from this genre are normally Japanese.  I like Japanese a lot, but seeing a Western-influenced aspect like this is actually a breath of fresh air and even the developer of Harvest Moon said it best himself.  ""This game is amazing.""  Over the years, as the game has changed, they've added multiplayer coop, which I've yet to experience, which will probably add up another few hundred hours once I get people involved in the gameplay of this game.  This is a must-play farm simulator.  I'm looking at Sun Haven as my next go-to farm sim to try out at a later time, but it is an early access title."
22098,A perfect spiritual successor to Harvest Moon.
22099,Stardew Valley is a amazing game that i can come back to and even though i've done most things in the game it is still fun each time i revisit it. 10/10 GAME TO GOOD
22100,so fun
22101,wowee

22105,If you like Micecraft and RPG's I think you'll find yourself enjoying this game a lot. currently I am playing it unmodded to get an understanding of it... but I think I will be playing this game for a very long time b4 I consider finally getting to modding it. highly recommend.
22106,"The only downside is that after you get your daughter hooked to it, she won't let you play anything else"
22107,Good wholesome game. 10/10

22114,Tranquil and wholesome game. Enjoyed this game very much both on my own and in co-op.
22115,This game has quite the learning curve from the beginning. But it gets better once I got the hang of how to play the game. It is really nice to play and the hours just goes by without even noticing it~
22116,good
22117,this game is wonderful!

22128,"I'd say Stardew Valley is a great game. It really lets you live the cottage core style you've always wanted. No matter how much I've played it, it's never gotten boring. It has a cool story line to it, and maybe a bit of mystery I would say? I don't know, but it's cool. Although, you can run into some bugs. Apart from that, great game."

22160,"When I first started playing the game, I was quite frustrated with how fast time passed. Then I modded it, and I love the game. It's very chilll, and fun. There's a learning curve, with directionality with the cursor vs which direction your character is facing, but I promise you, you will have fun. Especially if you like Farming simulators."
22161,Very fun time killer 10/10 very entertaining and cool
22162,its a alright game
22163,"yes
"
22164,ABIGAIL
22165,much fun
22166,Love it
22167,Gives you the farming experience people want.
22168,"Great game that settled its own genre over the farming simulators. 

What do you get to do in this wholesome game:

- Manage your farm  (yay!) in different ways (crops, harvest, animals, buildings) 
- Interact with the village NPCS (marriage options too).
- Go fight monsters into the cave (spooky).
- Progress into the village events and charming story.
- Enjoy the simple things of your virtual farming life.
- Mod friendly

Personally what would i like to see this game to be even more perfect than it already is

- Saving not tied to sleeping (maybe there are mods covering this).
- More farming crops and automation handling.

At the time it got released, it was a personal favorite indie of the year of mine.

An example of a labour of love, good job conernedApe!

The story is meh, not really that big and doesn't control the game but that's ok since you can basically write your own narrative, do mini quests, explore and progress in a satisfying way. Co-op is integrated pretty seamlessly so you can play with friends whenever. The world is very peaceful and the music + ambience slaps. I heard that one person made this is...I'm shocked! Some friends recommended this to me, I hope to surpass their hours. Great game for all ages, shapes and sizes. 

Pros:
Music
Exploration
Visuals (big fan of the pixel art style)
Vibes
Game Length (definitely worth the money, you can sink in so many hours)
There's probably much more I haven't even discovered due to my little time played...

Cons:
The energy system annoys me so much (I want to do more and sometimes it can be very jarring!)
You can't save progress until you sleep
Combat is simple (good if you wanna just turn off but not very engaging for those who want more)
Fishing can be an absolute pain
Anchovys fetch quest, me and my homies hate the anchovy fetch quest.

EDIT: I am definitely not addicted, I just crave Stardew Valley every day, my empire of star fruit is growing and spreading globally and I'm accumulating millions of coins every second."
22184,good game
22185,Nothing to be said that hasn't been said already. There is a calmness but also a serious resolve coming from playing this game. Also anyone saying it is relaxing has not made the mines their main excursion destination. There are a lot of small secrets to discover about the town people that make you really involved in the game. This will forever remain a go-to for good feels.
22186,Relaxing background music.  And it is the style of game where you can go as deep into stuff as you want.  Still discovering more and more stuff in this world
22187,Farm is life
22188,"This game is created by only one person, but still holy moly this game is so good in everything. Gameplay, visual, music, characters and etc. - its all great!"
22189,"Fun game
I call it Farming sim but not"
22190,"5 years in on my oldest save
maybe I'll make my farm pretty eventually"
22191,"uhh farming game, yeah /j but anyways this is really fun to play with friends or just alone since theres so much to it :]"
22192,"This is simply the best game ever. It is so fun with mods, as well."
22193,i like it hope you will too
22194,yes
22195,cool gomer
22196,Probably my favourite game I've ever played :)
22197,it's a good game yk
22198,"This game is the greatest, i cant stop playing. Its full of adventure, quests, making family's and friends bring people together learning how to create a farm, mining, fishing there's so much to do. The only thing i don't like about it is when you have to turn ores in to bars  you have to use 5 ores for one bar instead of 1 for 1."
22199,<3
22200,"Stardew Valley is one of the best games I have ever played. I dont care about Elden Ring and how good it looks and how long you've waited for it to come out. It will never be as good as stardew valley. Ive been playing this game on and off because I have a life that doesn't let me play constantly and it will never get old. if you haven't played it by now, you're missing out my friend."
22201,"fuck you, dont make me write something about the game, i gave it a thumbs up! what more do you want!"
22202,good happy
22203,1
22204,10/10
22205,"Haven't found another farming life sim I like more, and I've looked a lot"
22206,pretty gud stuff
22207,Like Animal Crossing but with monsters to kill and farm animals to raise!
22208,sussy fun
22209,i mean theres a reason why this is such a well known game: its simply amazing
22210,"came for farming
stayed for fishing
women want me
fish fear me"
22211,a.
22212,Game is chill. Like minecraft but without the fun aspect (jk). I get to have wife in game to fill void of real life. I miss you Brad rip 1997-2018
22213,very good game for the price! i love the gameplay and playing with friends is even more fun!
22214,mazisi var kardeşim
22215,an absolute masterpiece 10/10
22216,good game :)
22217,"So much fun. It's nicer to play with friends but it's also fun to play alone. It has hundreds of hours of gameplay (unless you a trying to speedrun) and very cute animals. Shane is the love of my life and I have never married anyone else.

22223,"the game is really good, i find my self playing for hours at a time. the best thing about it is that the game is simple to learn and easy to play, allowing for a 10/10 experience."
22224,Made a big farm then forgot about it for 3 months

22226,Very satisfying and well made game.
22227,very good
22228,Greatest Game
22229,its very calming
22230,Super fun game. I have been playing with my cousins for a while and it has been a blast. If you like economy and progress games this is the game for you.
22231,Yes.
22232,Got more flour and oil in this game than in real life. What's not to like? Lovely gift for kid
22233,.
22234,i love this game always have fun and there is always something to do. Played way more over on xbox but finally got my pc and moved over to steam. With all the different maps and relationship options the replayability is very high.
22235,I now want to start a farm in the middle of nowhere
22236,Love it! Really impressive how one person could make a game so complex!
22237,Amazing Game! Amazing Team! It's the game that keeps on giving! This game has it all! A great game at a great price for all ages! Must recommend!
22238,w
22239,itsaMeManiggeio
22240,its a relaxing game that you can spend hours on and not even realsie
22241,It's a wholesome farming game. The pixel graphics give it a bit of a calming feeling.
22242,farm
22243,Cute indie game <3
22244,Relaxing
22245,。
22246,Fun game
22247,10/10 Best Farming Simulator Game
22248,So way back in the mine got my pickaxe swinging from side to side - side side to side
22249,Literally no game is as cozy and lovely as gay farming game :)
22250,"Okay I did enjoy this game a bit. But I do not see why people love it so much. There's so much walking around, waiting, and boredom. I always want combat in games and in this game its just swinging at enemies without being able to move, or they don't take enough knockback so you have to back up. and i'm really not a fan.
as for farming, its kind of fun? but its still farming, its waiting for your crops to grow and its still boring
fishing is pretty decent, but again its still very repetitive. 
and the NPCs... I didnt come to a ""video game"" to give some pixels with names rocks so they marry me. none of them had anything intereseting to say or an interesting ""personality""
Overall, huge disappointment.
This should not have this many positive reviews, let alone surpass terraria, that absolutely sucks."
22251,Absolute shite. 5 starsdews.
22252,It's just a vibe ngl
22253,"Its easy to play after work. Is fun and interactive with other players and friends in co-op versions or just to play solo. So many fun paths to take. Would definitely recommend to everyone.
"
22254,very goob
22255,This is my second account.
22256,"Cute and low stress, but difficult enough to be challenging."
22257,fun
22258,great
22259,"Recommend it for Harvest Moon farms.

If you find it hard to manage your farm, you can install mods to increase plant growth. Naturally, the focus of this game is to have a farm and a dating sim.

As usual, mods make this game better depending on what you want (though you may have a hard time looking).

7/10"
22260,"Good.
I became a Tea Sapling Dealer in this game."
22261,yesh gud gud game yeh
22262,This game reminds me of the peaceful life I had before father Vittorio was kidnapped by the Sicilian mafia.
22263,Nice and calming game to cope with the stress of the world!
22264,Love this game
22265,"this game well let me tell youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!!

22270,Gud (:
22271,Good
22272,good game yuh
22273,Perfect game
22274,"The modding scene for this game has REALLY hit its stride! I super duper recommend Stardew Valley Expanded, it's legitimately seamless."
22275,pretty sure this game is why i failed the regents in high school
22276,:O !!!
22277,awesome and cool
22278,"If i could live in this world, i would gladly sacrifice a testicle."
22279,"I love this game. As a youth I played the Harvest Moon and Rune Factory series and this game hits home. If you enjoy those types of games where you can farm, mine, fish, cook, craft things, and socialize with the townsfolk - look no further, this game is for you. Did I mention it also has multiplayer? The absolute best part of this game is being able to play with friends. Amazing game 10/10"
22280,"Without a doubt, one of my favorite games to play."
22281,Big fan
22282,Very good
22283,"muito bom n vejo minha familia a 5 meses
"
22284,"Y'all I'm going to be honest, this game is simple, it's fun, vanilla is a cute game but i added a few mods in because after a while it feels predictable, obvi im gonna say you should get it, it's cute and fun, but mods might be needed after a while because it can be boring."
22285,"Great game, mods are fun, but if you're going to use mods, use SMAPI directly, do NOT use Vortex"
22286,This game sucks
22287,"Good game
10/10

Thanks Grandpa very cool."
22291,An entertaining time killer!
22292,"Great game, even more fun to mod!"
22293,"I started off playing Stardew for mobile. I've put in hundreds of hours, I just loved it so much. I enjoy all the cut scenes of different characters and building my farm and inventory. Decided to get in on my computer for more content and its been great! What a wonderful game. :D"
22294,chad
22295,i love this gam.

-smapi BREAKS

-kid is stuck in the black void inside the walls of our home
-i can see and hear him crawling around
-forever live with the consequences of our kid stuck in our walls
10/10 on my third farm play through :)"
22297,ur face goog woow game yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
22298,DTF? (Down to Fish)
22299,"This game is an incredible experience in the start you think its just another farming game. But after the slow earlygame the game picks up and becomes incredible. The early game may be slow (You will probably like the earlygame if its your first playthrough) but when you get to know the list of countless colorful characters with many personalities that you get to know overtime. The mid game is the most stressful/eventful part of the game you are constantly getting closer and closer to completing to the community center. Which I would say is the big story mission before the game is close to completion if this game wasn't so well made but even after you finish the ""main story boss"" you still have a ton to do ex: the movie theater. Also don't worry there is still more ginger island has about just as much content as the main island and is so in depth you can spend hours apon hours just watching tutorials and getting lost in the content ginger island has. I would have to say that the best part of ginger island is the farm or mr qi's room. Lets start with the farm its a HUGE plot of land that you can grow any crop on YEAR ROUND also next to the farm there is a few tiles you can use to plant fairy roses for almost the best passive income in the game fairy rose honey. About mr qi's room after you reach enough golden walnuts you get access to about the coolest shop in the game with the most innovative items up for purchase some of my favorites include the horse flute the sprinkler attachments and the qi's seasoning. The horse flute is used to summon your horse anywhere. The sprinkler attachment lets your sprinkler reach one tile further and the qi's seasoning improves buffs. The rest of the game is out for you to explore, but stardew valley isn't without its flaws like how difficult it is to make a stardew valley server because no easily accessible website right now (the multiplayer is fine but we want a server up 24/7) also for veterans of the game I want the game to start with the community center and the mine already open (after you have got to ginger island in one of your play through's) and if you have got to perfection in one world just for you to start with more energy, those are all of the big flaws and thats all I have to say its an amazing game."
22300,THis Game is Awesome
22301,very good game
22302,It will keep you entertained for hours on end
22303,I love this game so much and it has helped me deal with depression and anxiety so much. Fave game ever!
22304,Farm time!
22305,"It's awesome, so fun and relaxing!"
22306,I wish every game was this game.
22307,"Fun and chill. Good game to just relax with. 
Tip: Give the towns people gifts on their birthday for easy friendship points."
22308,"This game allows you to know the peace of a simple, small town life."
22309,its an amazing game. it has SO many features and great gameplay!
22310,this game has taken over my life
22311,"I've actually played a lot more than the 6 hours Steam thinks, since I now have this game on Steam, Switch, PlayStation AND XBOX. That aught to be a good indicator of how much I like this game. (I probably wouldn't have bought a third one, much less a fourth, if I didn't really enjoy it.) My only sadness - the multiplayer is not compatible cross platform. But hey, that's true for almost every game."
22312,Gud Gam
22313,turnip
22314,yeah its alright
22315,wholesome
22316,i love it all such a good game
22317,"What's not to like? Frankly I think everyone knows this game by now. If you don't, google it. It's a thing. (Farming simulation) If you like harvest moon, you will love this. The creator was very dedicated to it, a lot of unique characteristics within. Obviously not just for money-making."
22318,game good
22319,fun farm yes
22320,one of the best shooter RPG's out there
22321,"My stardew obsession is back in full swing, this time on a Macbook air instead of Switch. 
My only qualm is that I'm on my laptop and don't want to have a mouse next to me. 
I've changed a few of the keyboard controls so that I can avoid the trackpad when possible but it is required at times (which wouldn't be a problem if I got a mouse but I am stubborn)
otherwise perfect!"
22322,Great game!
22323,This game is addictive and fun!
22324,I like that i get to have a cute little farm with my cute little boyfriend.
22325,fishing
22326,epic
22327,"It's my favorite game. Relaxing, familiar, engaging, a little bit addicting. If you already liked farming sims I don't know how you HAVEN'T tried Stardew yet but it's amazing. I often buy it for other people so they will play it with me. The newest updates gave TONS of extra content and gameplay."
22328,Farming plants and making crack.
22329,Fun and relaxing game with lots of content!
22330,"Love the game. 8/10. 

single player is awesome because you have enough time to do everything with the game pausing whenever you enter a menu. The game feels very well paced and if you enjoy playing alone its awesome.

However, my friends and I stopped playing the game halfway because the time limit for each day on multiplayer felt like it was too short and we all felt rushed. There was ( is? ) no way to stop the game for everyone, and even if there was that would be horrible if EVERYONE had to stop what they were doing for one person. 

It would be great is there was an option to adjust the days time length in multi-player. Otherwise, I feel like the games pacing in multiplayer is borderline anxious and near halfway in the game it becomes downright stressful.

Don't get me wrong, great game on all fronts BESIDES multi-players pacing."
22331,"Stardew Valley (SDV) is a diverse game.  I love that I can plant crops, chop wood, break stone, forage, fish (although I have difficulty with this part),  and interact with the villagers and give them gifts.  And, all this at your own pace.  I am nearing 50 yrs old and was introduced to this game by my oldest son about a year ago.  Who knew I would become a 'gamer', even if it's with one game only.  I also love that you can play on various systems.  Although, it would be nice if you could play your same farm from the PC on your mobile, instead of having to make a separate farm for each (also applies to anyone, like me, who started on the mobile and moved to the PC).  Beyond that, I LOVE this game!!!"
22332,It's a chill game
22333,relaxing farming game with some adventure
22334,"I love the aesthetic of this game. I like that it allows you to follow the storylines at your own pace, and there's no level of completion you need to reach in the game to have a satisfying experience."
22335,"I love this game man. Been playing since middle school and I'm now a freshman in college. Still one of the best games I've ever played, from the storylines to the gameplay itself. Please play this game, I promise you'll love it."
22336,goodgame
22337,"This is a great game solo or co-op. The key of the game is to collect and use resources to develop your farm in the way you want. So many options to customize your farm! I really enjoy the graphics, too."
22338,Its good
22339,bf wants to marry another grill

22347,"very seggsi, would reccoment, quite epiv :thumbs_up:"
22348,"This game is f-ing bomb. I’m a huge fan of Rune Factory and this game hit all of the points I enjoyed in RF. Farming, mining, fishing, dungeon diving, relationship building, town events, and figuring out what is the best way to make a crap ton of money."
22349,"10/10.

Only issue is I can't kill Pierre and steal his wife. Only option now is to screw his daughter.

22353,"when you grind for artisan equipments so much so that you forgot to socialize 0 HEARTS , pretty lonely , but hey at least I got my old buddy kegs here to keep me sane and rich"
22354,This game will turn you into a full time employee for no pay. If you find any games addicting don't fuck around with this one.
22355,Truly an amazing game. Very fun and exactly what one is probably hoping for picking up such a game.
22356,I play this with my family and its great. Simple with complexity is how i would describe it. Its a nice chilled out game to play solo or co-op.
22357,is this addictive substance.jpg
22358,good
22359,Really soothing and relaxing game.
22360,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

22363,"If you like farming sims like Harvest Moon / SOS or even simple simulation games like Sims or Animal Crossing, you will enjoy this game. It's a fun way to relax. You can play for 15 - 30 minutes at a time or engage entire marathon sessions depending on how much time you have to dedicate to a game like this. Great before-bed sort of game!"

22366,i hate it. clearly.
22367,GOOD
22368,"I recommend playing this game with a friend that knows a little about the game so they can guide you, but its very easy to play without a friend too! I love how there are several things you can work on! Also, I love that you can invest hours into the game without knowing something and figure it out later! I received the game for free, but definitely worth the $15, for a game with plenty of hours worth of gameplay! Fell in love with this game pretty quickly!"
22369,Very cute.

22385,"10 out of 10, will play again. And again."
22386,"Lets me live out a dream version of me where I'm a tax-evading attractive multimillionaire cottagecore lesbian goddess (cause now I can't die nor age) where everyone loves me.

If someone paid me 1 billion to enter this game for a year then come back, I wouldn't do it because then I wouldn't want to come back."
22387,"Awesome! One of the most relaxing games I've played. It offers a lot of quests, decision-making, scenarios to explore, and possibilities to test. Of course a great game!"

22398,good
22399,"it's a fun game especially with mods.  I highly recommend installing the basic mods.  Look up how to use smapi.  You must start by adding that before any mods will work.   u really only need smapi and CJB for a great experience- CJB is the best and most vital mod imo.   If you want the small tweaks like grass dig spot and faster automate, which are nice too, then include content patcher to help with those.

22400,"Good stuff, would sell my soul to joja for 1 G."
22401,It is a deep game with a lot of layers.
22402,This is a game you buy that you can legit get your moneys worth. A game you can fallback on when youre really not sure what to play. It never gets old and there is so much to do!

22408,sw shgd
22409,good game
22410,"I have around 400 hours on this game across all different platforms, other steam accounts, etc. and I will probably play 400 hours more. This game has so much depth that it is unreal. The fact a single person made this game is mind-blowing, ConcernedApe is a truely talented individual. This game might not be for everyone but it is undoubtedly fantastic."

Reminds me of the good old days on the farm irl, planting them seeds gave me major flashbacks to my younger days, now I sit at my PC and pretend to farm, the cows are very wholesome too, the bestest cows in the universe. The quackers are also very good, they lay the good eggs."

22445,"There is Bug where Achievements dont unlock on steam. It is a fairly common complaint in the forums over the years but the devs have yet to issue a fix.  There are a few workarounds  but they have not worked for me. 
I have picked up and dropped this game like 5 times. Such a bug in this type of game really kills motivation and prevents the player from getting into it."
22446,Very good
22447,Greatv game!

22550,I live here.
22551,Best game ever.
22552,"You can live your best farming life in a pretty quaint village somewhere. I enjoy the changing of the seasons, though beware - a whole crop of summer veggies dies over night when you reach the first day of autumn. Lessons are learnt and items are crafted and bought and time is nicely spent in the creative valley. Highly recommend to individuals looking for a pleasant and productive time. Great game to play with friends!"
22553,I would live in stardew valley
22554,"A cute, no stress farming game with charming visuals and characters."
22555,game lon
22556,Genius work of craft. A simple game that I can (and will continue to) spend countless hours on because it connects with my creativity and my well-being. It's honestly the most relaxing game produced.

22562,Fucking amazing game
22563,"This game is a perfect balance of challenging and relaxed things to explore and expand on. I love beautifying my farm, but can also go on a high-pressure adventure in the mines or pursue random quests for the other villagers. I love the characters, who have surprisingly in depth back stories and personalities for such basic graphics that never lag. This is my favourite game!"
22564,a perfect game
22565,"this game has big nuts
"
22566,Where sex mod
22567,"I feel like I have just played similar games (Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, etc.) too much to find this interesting enough to continue playing. I definitely see why others who didn't spend 10 years of their childhood playing Harvest Moon religiously would find this game fun and interesting. However, there's just not enough unique things about the game to make we want to continue playing it."
22568,makes me forget about my problems. just play silly little farm game
22569,mmmm melon
22570,"This game is good but worse then the following: Terraria, Minecraft, Valorant, super auto pets, Elden Ring, God of War, Elder scrolls Skyrim, Brawlhalla, Lego star wars the skywalker saga, sea of theives we sailin with the team, Fallout 4, Fortnite, League of Legends, Rocket league. Ps: this game is ok"

22599,"Worth every penny! I have Stardew on every platform but I think computer is the best. It's controls are the easiest to understand, and the online play is the best and, more importantly, it's free to play online. Also, it's just an awesome game regardless of what you play it on. :)"
22600,"Thank you. I will not stop recommending this game. It is mind-blowing how much it has grown when it held a special place in my heart even when it first released. This will always be a game that I come back to, Thank you for being a very valuable addition to my life."

22604,really fun would recommend
22605,"I have been playing this game on the switch since it was released there, and have logged over 1,000 hours between all of my saves and still have so much more to explore and do. While I haven't played as much on PC, it is amazing how many mods can be installed and how much life the game has despite so many hours logged on my end. This is one of my favorite games to relax and play!"

22618,very comfy game
22619,Farming
22620,Keep everything for the festival mofo
22621,"Stardew Valley is one of the most passively aggresive bad games.
Your energy bar is so low that you're spending more time recovering, than doing anything remotely considered fun. And if you don't make it to bed (an actual game mechanic) in time, well tough luck you're losing more money than you made grinding that whole day + you will start with even less energy, which is really shitty since walking distances are very long and at nighttime it's almost impossible to see where you're going. Grinding is extremely slow, and thats exactly what you'll be doing here exclusively. Selection of animals and plants is extremely restrictive. Overall not a pleseant experience."
22622,Its a cute farming simulator with just the right touch of stress and random moments where the characters rip your heart out of your chest.
22623,👍
22624,Emily.
22625,easy gameplay with a cute story and lots to do
22626,fish
22627,"You know what I really hate in this game?

You're CONSTANTLY running against time!

Today was raining... Cool no crops to water, let's get to the mine!
Oh there's a task in pierre's... ok going back home to gather what I need.
Then go through whole town to find the NPC I need, at the right time and the right place.

By the time I arrive to said mine it's past 12:00, my day is ruined.

Can't even do one damn task because the day runs so fast and if I dare taking a wrong turn it's instantly more hours lost, and I better get back home before 00:00 or it's going to be much much worse.

Can't believe this is so stressful to play. Running all around nonstop because I doesn't actually have the time to do anything. What a scam."
22628,"Great to play multiplayer with someone!  Very fun and easy to lose yourself in the game
"
22629,"good

22633,One of the best game i have ever played.
22634,"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries."
22635,yes

22650,"It is an amazing game and very good. I would indeed recommend it, as you may have guessed. However, it is very exhausting and has the immediate danger of creating excel files, sheets and spending more time on the wiki than ingame."

I still go back even today to check the new things that have been added.  More than worth the money.  As you can tell seeing all the hours I played.

He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear!Fits of rage! Selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, and envy;Drunkenness, orgies, and the like!I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this;Will not inherit the kingdom of God!But if we walk in the light,As He is in the light,We have fellowship with one another,and the blood of Jesus, His son, purifies us all from sin!For the wages of sin is death!But the free gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ, our lord!But if we are living in the light,As God is in the light,Then we have fellowship with each other,And the blood of Jesus, His son, cleanses us from all sin,If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves, and not living in the truth.But if we confess our sins to Him, He is faithful,And just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all wickedness.Pride! Greed! Wrath! Envy! Lust! Gluttony, and Sloth!So put to death the sinful, earthly things lurking within you.Have nothing to do with sexual immorality--Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit!All of us have become like one who is unclean,And all our righteous acts are like filthy rags!We all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind, our sins sweep us away!No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind!And God is faithful. He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear!""Vengeance is mine; I will repay!"" says the Lord!There hath no temptation taken you but as is common to man.But God is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be tempted above all!"
22667,pretty neat
22668,Recommend if you want an easy going game that requires a little bit of strategy but nothing that requires a lot of thought. Just an easy paced and relaxed farming game that you can play by yourself or with a group. It's kind of like if Minecraft and the Sims had a baby.
22669,Its fun
22670,"Good game, fun with friends, addicting, [i]very addicting[/i]"
22671,"Extremely fun and the game play keeps you occupied for many hours, but, the writing for the characters could use some work. Some of the characters feel like they never go through development :/ otherwise its a fantastic game!"
22672,Gud Gam
22673,soothing and nice
22674,good
22675,yeahg
22676,"Fun, Amazing and Chill. 10 out of 10 will play again."
22677,mid
22678,very gud :3 if you like stardew valley or just a chill game...Uh YAY here you go
22679,fun
22680,"It's real good, can plant my crops in funny configurations and make really edgy jokes while I play with my wife"
22681,such a calm and peaceful game. i love it to bits. recommend to anyone who's looking for a game to spend many many hours on and not get bored!!
22682,cool game.
22683,Best Stardew Valley simulator on the market.
22684,"Actually very fun game, wasnt going in with a lot of expectations but i actually had a super fun time and still am"
22685,Its a relaxing game to play and it has lots of fun things to do.But somethings are op like mass producing wine and you can make easy money which is kinda boring.
22686,good game bro
22687,junimo kart
22688,very good for younger people but people older with also very much enjoy the adventure and how simple of a game it is. it is a very enjoyable game and would recommend this to pretty much everybody
22689,play it
22690,"Personally, I wish there was more to do (I vastly prefer Starbound for this reason), but if you're into farming sims? Hard to beat it."
22691,more frog
22692,ngl its pretty goddamn good
22693,"good game, thanks for reading my review, thank you, thank you.

Thanks

thx"
22694,Really fun fishing game.
22695,I like a lot about this game but it can get boring at times.
22696,"it's relaxing and enjoyable. I've been playing this game since about 2019, and can pick the game up at any time (when it sounds fun). I enjoy playing with funny mods and funny packs that change the world up. the graphics for a (pixel?) game are really good! yes yes this is all I can think of at the moment... Good game 10/10"
22697,"The first steam game I was ever gifted, and I'm so glad I was.
The game is very lovely. Especially when you play it online -w-"
22698,You f*ck an emo girl in a cemetery. 10/10
22699,yeah its fun ig
22700,its fun :)
22701,"GEEEEEEEEEEEEEE WIZZZZZZZZZZZZ what a fantastic game/time consumer *Do not buy in the middle of the school year, you will be fricked on*"
22702,:D
22703,more than just a farming game
22704,"One of the best games I ever played. The gameplay loop is amazing and a buttload of fun. If I had to tell you one piece of advice to use while playing, it would be that, if you feel like there's nothing to do, there always is. Just take a break for a week or so and suddenly it will feel like you've discovered a new way to play."
22705,:)
22706,Fun little game.
22707,Just great fun for me and my girlfriend!
22708,"Such a fun game. I wasn't sure at first if I would enjoy it, but I finally gave it a try and I love it so much. I recommend this if you enjoy farming games, simulators or you need something to take your mind off of things.

My grandfather recently passed away, and this game gave me something to get away from life and make life just a little easier to enjoy."
22709,peaceful and calming game
22710,Very fun game I just wish the characters had more content. And also Sebastian is the best.
22711,"good gam
i like frog :)"
22712,One of the best games i have played. Such a calming game that helps you relax!! Beautiful design and story. Would totally recommend to buy and try it as it is worth it!!!
22713,great game
22714,"Such an addictive game, can't stop playing once you start it"
22715,it is good
22716,"Played upwards of 1000 hours on switch and although the pc is harder to play on it is fun to experiment with mods
"
22717,"This is the first time ive bought a game and it didnt immediately feel like a waste of money, there is something for every single person to enjoy and the storyline takes very long to complete but the small milestones and quests keep the game insanely engaging the entire way. and even after you ""finish"" the game, there is more to do. 10/10, definitely an addiction i feel good about"
22718,I married a local emo to get a frog 10/10
22719,An entertaining farm game that can keep you busy for hundreds of hours. Great pixel art and likeable characters.
22720,One of the best games I've ever played. Loved every minute of this relaxing adventure.
22721,"amazing game, not your average farming game. plenty of twists and turns with many things to do could not fault it at all. love it"
22722,Cheaper than therapy
22723,กะจะรีฟันเกมนี้แต่รู้ตัวอีกทีก็ 21 ชั่วโมงเข้าไปแล้วครับ!
22724,"Best of its kind that Ive seen, a lot more depth than you might see on the surface. Not many areas to improve honestly."
22725,"It's very relaxing, yet engaging. I'm blind, so it's almost completely accessible for me to play and it's entirely too addicting! I got the game for a friend and have been recommending it to anyone that plays video games!"
22726,"I love this game so much, and it's so easy to play with a controller rather than computer and mouse. It's such a chilled out game, but you can make it more adventurous as you go along as well. I really love this game and would advide it to anyone who likes farming and building games."
22727,Stardew Valley is a great game to just relax and hang out a little. Theres a lot of content in this game. Ive played 60 hours on a single world and I still feel like I have so many things to do. The characters are so sweet and they actually feel like different people. The game does feel a bit repetitive when harvest your crops or feed your animals but you can just not plant crops and get money in other ways.
22728,This game is absolutely beyond fantastic. The best farming/life sim I've ever played!
22729,"Every time I tried to load my save file, it kept crashing. So I've decided to request for a refund. Been trying for almost 2 hours now to load the game, sad and disappointed. Played the mobile version but since the 1.5 update is not coming anytime soon so I've considered to purchase and play on my PC. Turns out the game crashed every time I try to load the game."
22730,"I love this game, it honestly really is so enjoyable!"

22734,"[h1] Now THIS is awesome! [/h1]
[i] I picked up this game a month after it's release in 2016 and I still return every now and then. [/i]

Stardew Valley puts you in charge of your deceased grandfathers old farm plot. 
Its located in Pelican Town. A town filled with exciting people to befriend or maybe even, belove. Furthermore, each season comes with special festivals that fit very well.

Your task here is to rebuild your grandfathers farm to its former glory, whilst making so much dough that you eventually can afford spending 10 mill. on a clock covered in gold. Yep you heard me, a clock! :-P

Your way to this grand prestige consists of [i] *deepdiving in the wiki*.. [/i] ehm.., I mean, mastering every single one of the following skills: [b] farming, mining, foraging, fishing and combat. [/b] You will eventually learn your way of planting the right crops, foraging for the right forageables and fishing for the right fish all while donating strange artifacts to the local museum and finding secret letters that guide you in the right direction.

[b] The 1.5 Update expands on the features we love while also adding new ones. Its a really well developed update that bring back old school players like myself! [/b] 

[h1] This game is a MASTERPIECE [/h1]
Therefore I had to scavenge my brain for these cons.

[b] CONS [/b]
- Trains are useless.
- Too few ""Special Orders"".
- Combat can be frustrating.
- Some festivals lack content.
- ""Journey Of The Prairie King"" is way too difficult."
22735,"Great calming game with a good soundtrack.

If you think this is JUST a farming game, you are VERY wrong!

Farming is the base but it gets weird, very weird"
22736,pls love me haley
22737,I love this game so much. Played years ago and recently miss the game so play a new save again. Just amazing.

22747,"I have hundreds of hours on this game before my brother broke my Xbox, but these are some of the happiest memories I ever had. Bought it for 2 of my old friends so they could enjoy, but they never played it. This game got me through most of my depressive episodes, the constant excessive loneliness I feel everyday, and gives me a sense of belonging. You just don't get that from any game.."
22748,"good game monkee

22749,This game is like actual farming. It's tedious and annoying but the payoff is completely worth the grind.

22774,relaxing game
22775,This is the greatest game of all time. The drama is more gripping than The Last of Us. The open world has more freedom than Skyrim. The gameplay is more challenging than Elden Ring. And the strategy is more involved than Starcraft II. I have yet to play a masterpiece as glorious as Stardew Valley. Play it. I dare you.
22776,I really like the games design and the storyline in it. I also like how much you can do with mods and it's overall a really fun game that you can spend lots of hours on with your friends.
22777,"leave your amazon job, return to nature, screw over amazon, then beat the shit out of bezos. Truly the best game"
22778,"i was gonna review at 69 hours but i overshot it by accidient anyways

this game is really good bc it has a lot of content to keep you occupied for hours

22783,It's really fun not much more to say.

22790,"Life changing experience, especially when shared with someone special.

Cute game for couples, either marry another player or romance one of the 8 base game options. The gameplay can take time, especially on your first playthrough and earning money will not be easy but you will learn as time goes on. Not a steep learning curve but enough to keep you engaged for hours. Upon becoming bored or 100 percenting the game (of which I have not managed to do yet) I recommend looking into modding the game. (my personal recommendations are SVE and RSV) 

Am currently on my 3rd playthrough and I full well know there will be another one."

22827,"By far very surprised how much I've enjoyed this, the characters are great, its fun and just a masterpiece."
22828,"Been playing this game on and off for years. There's a reason it's basically top-tier standard for any list of resource management games, sim games, cozy games, sweet games, etc. It can be as challenging and stressful as you'd like, or not. The charm, attention to detail, and discovery in this game never really stop. Mechanically pretty simple and lots of ways to navigate goals and accomplishments, so it's really great for people new to gaming. I swear the opening music instantly lowers my blood pressure. The ultimate comfort game."
22829,"with 120+ hours in (and counting), i can safely say that stardew valley is on of my favorite games of all time. it single handedly took what made harvest moon fun and just expanded it. Eric Borone, really refinded this game to a mirror shine. goes to show his passion for creation is limitless. only nit picks is that the marriage stuff and the way that you interact with villagers (outside of the cutscenes) is pretty limited, and an expansion to that would be very nice. but im aware that its alot to ask of a single developer. but it would be nice to see character interation expanded apone. other than that, this game is near flawless, and i can see my self clocking in, hundreds apone hundreds of hours into this great fun indie game. without a doubt in my mind, pic this game up, you will not regret it.

It is fantastic. I have put so many hours into this game without becoming bored! The modding community is also fantastic and adds an extra layer to the game. My most favourite game so if you are on the fence about buying it or not I beg you to do it! This game is highly influencing a new wave of games coming out and I cannot wait for ConcernedApe's new upcoming game!"
22968,This game is so wholesome and perfect for an end of day destress session with your loved one. You can play co-op or alone and there are countless adventures to complete.

22991,"Amazing game!! I played this originally on the nintendo switch edition and it was great, but having it on pc is something else. It's super immersive, cute, and all-round good fun. Co-op or local multiplayer means you can share the experience (and useful items!) with others."
22992,fire
22993,"good game, 10/10
"
22994,"When I first started playing the game when it initially came out, I found it hard to play and confusing. All I had ever played before was Harvest Moon and those games are really simple. Once I gave this game a second chance years later, I found it way more engaging than Harvest Moon with much more to do to keep you entertained for months. This has become one of my favorite comfort games that I find myself returning to when I want to play something easy and lighthearted. This game is an ADHD person's dream come true allowing them to hyper focus on it for hours."

22996,Fantastic game. Immersive and fun.
22997,its like fortnite but farming instead so its pretty good
22998,Literally obsessed. Can't believe it took me years after buying the game to actually play it.
22999,It's awesome for kids and adults
23000,"This is a review for Stardew Valley on the Steam Deck. (Stardew is a great game with a developer who loves their game and community)

Stardew is rated as Verified for the Steam Deck, this means that right from the start playing Stardew Valley should have no issues at all and require no tinkering. 

This biggest issue is the lag. The game suddenly drops to 0 FPS for a few seconds. Tried changing v-sycn, display mode, limiting FPS and nothing solves this issue. 

Other than that, I wish the game would be more zoomed out. I feel like I don't get to see far enough, currently as zoomed out as possible and it still feels small. 

I do not recommend Stardew Valley for the Steam Deck, the lag makes it unplayable."
23001,issa good game
23002,"I love it. It's a really cute farming sim with amazing side stories. Some of it is not intuitive, but it's generally easy to figure out how things work.

Definitely worth the money!"

23017,"Very chill game for groups of friends or with your s/o, progressing through the challenges is very good but not necessary if you just want a time sink, or even good for speed runners!"
23018,Game good. Farm game.
23019,yeahyeah
23020,"I don't think this game needs another review, considering its popularity, but let me just say I never would have thought myself a farming sim kinda girl - until I started playing this. There's also a vast amount of mods available for this game which expand the universe quite a lot, and give a lot of replayability. Every play through is different, and this is what's important :)"

23046,very fun and good game.
23047,"Its a good game for people looking for a great 32 bit type game, its long and can be difficult but i love it so much :) Its availible to be modded if you like that but its a difficult process and i would recommend watching fluffy sez if he has a tutorial on it. But its a long fun game you can play for hours. The beginning is slow but once you get the first upgrade on tools and the house it flys by and its super fun. Everything you cold want in a game like this lol."
23048,i can see why people like it but im more of a terraria person myself
23049,10/10
23050,grandpa gave me a farm. i spent 20 years of my life on it trying to grow crops and make money. didnt work so i came home and played stardew valley instead
23051,best game for relaxing and has actual challenges with rewards for overcoming them. Best fishing minigame!
23052,"Tis a good time. Comfy farm game
"
23053,"the in depth story that you have to do tasks given by the citizens of stardew to unlock is incredibly in depth. building up the farm you inherit by your deceased grandfather to being able to build relationships with the single npcs no matter on what gender you chose for your farmer. this game hit high levels of story to fighting to building that i haven't seen in another game. I 100% recommend this game for anyone to just sit down get cozy and build a farm, life, and story with."
23054,good
23055,It has a wide variety of resources and ways to get them

23060,"love it bro, genuinely keeps me entertained for a long time."
23061,"i  recommend  this  game  for  everyone  actually.  i  think  every  type  of  person  will  find  there  something  for  theirself:  decorating,  farming,  fishing...  stardew  valley  gives  you  a  lot  of  options,  you  can  use  them  in  a  creative  way  or  just  play  the  game  the  way  it  should  be  played.  chill  atmosphere  there  helps  you  relax  yourself,  you  can  play  it  after  a  stressful  day  to  have  a  better  evening,  it  can  calm  your  anxiety  or  overthinking.  it  got  me  through  a  lot  of  tough  things  so  i  feel  very  connected  to  it.  i  really  like  how  this  game  was  created  by  one  person  and  yet  it  could  easily  beat  some  the  most  popular  games  in  some  categories.  personally,  i'd  play  it  all  the  time,  it's  always  a  pleasure  to  do  so"
23062,Shane 10/10
23063,"Maybe it's cause I'm always stoned af when I play this game, but really, what's not to love? Farming, mining, foraging, fishing, cooking, creating friendships and improving relationships, completing the community bundles, building your farm from the ground up. People I've talked to who have never played the game always ask me what's so special about a farming game ... but you just need to play it, then you'll know the wholesome addiction that is Stardew. I, like many others here, have spent >400 hours in this game, so I promise, it's not just a boring sim. 

Biggest suggestions? 
- Play it vanilla your first run, then add the expansion mods from Nexus. 
- Also, don't look at the guides online. Don't let the grind get in the way of your enjoyment for your first time playing. Explore, take your time, don't worry about anything all too much. Explore the town and find what you enjoy doing the most. Figure things out for yourself - it's more rewarding. After Year 2 you can restart with mods and then follow the guides online that will maximize your profits and in-game time. Until then, do yourself a favor, and stay away from reddit lol."

23076,"Love the game, very addicting to play. It's very cute and I like playing it when i want to do something more relaxing."
23077,It's a wonderful game for just being able to relax with someone or just burn a few hours. Cannot recommend it enough.

23080,"This game was the gateway drug to my love of farming sim games.  I still love it.  Sometimes you just need to load it up and chill out on your farm for awhile.  Cannot recommend this game enough, it is a leader for a reason.  Play it and you won't regret it."

23096,"i don't even kniow how to explain this game. In April; m yr frined gifted me it and the problem is that it got so addicting that All i did was play thios game non stop. I gained 40 hours in 3 days and I didnt do or think about anything else except tjhis game. I f  I was offline I would get worried about my farm and animals and it got too the point where I played iut for 15 hours straight after the 40. AFter that I kinda lost interest and I dont even play it anymore, but april was fun"
23097,"fun and calming except for when I have to fish, then it's angering and stressful"
23098,its really a fun game when you play with others
23099,"Is a chill game but also get an agenda and plan what you do in the beginning the days can pass too quickly and you can run out of stamina too fast, but once you are all set you can actually chill in-game."
23100,"Amazing game 
leah best girl"
23101,"price is worth the amount of content.  very popular game on consoles and mobile aswell! modable with nexus on pc, which makes it more worth it if playing on steam. very easy to learn but at first wont seem like much, but the game is much more than it appears. one of the best out there with great thriving community and the creator concerned ape, is very active with communication! 1.5 was a huge update, like its own free dlc doubling the size of the base game. modding can further add much more as the modding community is very active and i dont see them dieng down anytime soon."
23102," I used to play this on streams, and I have to say, it's a great farming simulator."
23103,best 15 bucks of my life
23104,I can't stop playing!!!!
23105,"After over 200 hours across multiple platforms I have had so much fun playing this game, I still haven't even come close to completing everything. Runs well on anything, definitely worth the price."
23106,V fun. Would recommend.
23107,"I love this game, I love the characters, I love how the farming works and I love pretty much everything else. Although I was a little overwhelmed initially with the amount of things to do, I really love this game"
23108,big fun
23109,"By now you most likely know about Stardew Valley. There is a reason everyone knows this game. It is by far one of the best sim/farming/crafting games out there and has remained that way for many years now. I have Stardew Valley on console and Steam for macOS. It was great playing the vanilla version and now I'm having great fun with the mods (Nexus). 

This game allows you to create your dream farm (or a group farm you can play with others online) in your way. There are many paths, braziers, scarecrows, statues, furniture, machines, buildings, fences, crops, flowers, trees, animals, etc. to make your farm perfect for your vision. You can also decorate most of the town (indoors and outdoors) as well! Farm, raise animals, mine, fish, forage, and more for materials to sell, use in crafts, or give to the NPCs as gifts.

The NPCs and storyline are immersive and entertaining. You can even marry and divorce them. There are secrets everywhere in this game. You can earn your way to an island that can be your home away from home. All the little details are what makes Stardew Valley so interesting.

I do suggest getting the Steam version for the modding ability. There are a few mods that honestly should be in the vanilla that help with quality of life issues. There are many great mods ranging from cheat menus to clothing or furniture options. I know some people either don't have the time or patience to play long term games like these so things like the cheat menu can really help allow the game to be played in a more efficient, quick way. Do you just want to decorate an entire world and your farm without playing? You can do that too with a mod that allows you to just get any item (kind of like creative mode in Minecraft).

However, it would be a shame to miss all the intriguing things that happen or are said in this game. If you like any game of this genre, you will love Stardew Valley. It is loved and consistently being updated. It truly is one of the best of this kind of game."
23110,yes
23111,The best game that worth of spend time to.
23112,"i definitely hate this game, thats why i have 1k hours on it"
23113,"My friend gifted me Stardew Valley as a birthday present :D 
Very fun game, I like it a lot!"
23114,yesgood
23115,"I thought it was not my type of game, but after a while, I got addicted. Despite it being a loop, it was still very enjoyable and fun.
"
23116,"this game is iconic. i own it on 3 different platforms (switch - 100+ hours, xbox - 150+ hours, pc - see above), its my favorite game of all time and I only just started playing with mods this week after playing since 2017, trust me on this one and buy it when you can"
23117,bought it twice
23118,Very much enjoyed Stardew when I always thought it wasn't my kind of game. The game loop is addicting and there's lots of little secrets to discover.
23119,"I absolutely adore this game, I've played it for years now and still never get bored. <3"

23131,"A delightful classic with plenty of farm, adventure, and social.

The amount of stuff is nearly endless, if you want to try everything, but I started to get worn out by lack of automation in ""late"" game. I felt pushed to only do things that can run more on autopilot (and nothing can be completely on autopilot) to escape the grind and have a shot at gold-sink-priced things."

23182,"Amazing game, very relaxing!"
23183,Such a fun relaxing game!
23184,"This game has been a great distraction since I lost my ability to walk. Sustained a work injury in January that leaves me permanently bedridden. It's so calming to build a farm and watch it thrive! I love the interactions with all the townfolk, and there's so many cool secrets in this game I can't even begin. Wish my wife could've played this game with me :)"
23185,"One of the best games in it's genre. Inspired by the SNES Harvest moon and with so much to do! It's not just farming, it's got romance, adventure, crafting, collecting, upgrading, dungeon-crawling (in the mines). And, it's full of little references to classic media such as Legend of Zelda, Howl's Moving Castle, and Breath of Fire. :)"
23186,"i just baught the ga,e for 7 days and am just speechless in this 7 days i learned a lot . and  that if  you ever get bored you can always download mods witch i admire
"
23187,yup yup fisj fisj
23188,"really relaxing game with an engaging and interesting plot. you don't have to do everything and can spend forever on one thing if you want to and there's even a plot option for that.

i love this game and the coop is so fun, great way to connect with friends.

23189,Corn
23190,i love it so so much it cured my mental illness/hj
23191,Wish Clint was open past 4.
23192,Escapism at its finest. A good bit of realism to set the down-to-earth tone. It quells that urge to run away forever
23193,"I can only say: I love this game. It is so full of different tasks to do that each have their own gameplay aspects so it never gets boring. There are sooo many secrets to discover and just so much content that it never gets boring. And on the other hand it is so relaxing. After a long day of work I always find myself spiraling back to this game and can forget my troubles in an instand. The villagers are charming and plentiful, as is the whole world. The pixel graphic is just charming and all the seasons and seasonal events are so cozy. 10/10"
23194,"very good game and very long game, it is perfect with or without friends, it works for every age's. very chill game! ^^ :D"
23195,"Very cool, Abigail is very epic"

23197,"This is an awesome game, I recommend very highly."
23198,"Lots to do. Lots to re do. Light combat. Fishing mini game might be difficult for a lot of players.
Story and backstories are interesting. Build your own kinda farm. Marry, have kids. You can cheat
on your spouse. FYI marriage of same sex is possible. Make your own story."
23199,fun
23200,This game is boring 10/10
23201,very well made and super cute game. There is a lot more in the game than meets the eye. I love this game so much!
23202,Good Game but mods are what makes it good. If i didn't have the option to add some diversity i'd go crazy.
23203,"I bought this game expecting it to last me a few hours before getting bored, but I was greatly surprised when I saw everything that I could do and on top of that this game is really relaxing, just tending to your crops or visiting the village and interacting with the locals, I love that you can interact with them and they really feel like people as most games the NPCs don't really do that much and usually just say a few things. I love the art style and it's music. I have only played fourteen hours at the time of this review and I only have two achievements, but I have decided that I am going to try and get all the achievements, even the difficult ones, and also check out the modding side of this wonderful game."
23204,Great farming simulator!
23205,i like being productive in the videogame to distract myself from being productive irl
23206,a beautiful game to pass the hours away with much satisfaction and a great little story line.

23214,I LOVE THE WAY YOU CAN PROGRESS AT YOUR OWN PACE AND CAN MAKE PROGRESS EVERY DAY
23215,A great game for anyone that liked Farmville but needs extra entertainment.
23216,"This game can be rated on two bases:
Is there a fishing game? Yes
Is the fishing game good? See first answer

Seriously why is the fishing so good in this game."
23217,Its so cozy and complex! The graphics are amazing and so is the sound design. It tackles mature themes while still remaining a cozy farming sim

23228,E
23229,It's a great game for all ages and it's easy to come back to.  Everyone in my family from 6-60 years old enjoys playing from time to time.  I've taken years off from the game only to come back to it and enjoy it all over again.

23248,"This is one of the best games ive ever played. Not only was it my first reat experience playing a longerform game with goals and acheivments, but ther are so many ways to play and so many great stories to craft from the framework that ConcernedApe left for all of us to use. I genuinly cant suggest a better game to anyone. 100000000/10."
23249,Over all it's a very fun game if your into a more of a game to be grinding the farming part of it is alright but personally for me the best part is talking to the npcs and hearing their stories.
23250,Literally so crazy. Don't skip chores
23251,mm fishe

23265,$15 well spent on the best therapy I've ever received. Playing Stardew Valley is the only time I ever smile these days and it's helped me become more optimistic. Maybe one day I should leave the city to start farming...
23266,we do a little farming
23267,good yes
23268,"I love Stardew Valley, but I have a PC that I play it on, and my friend has a Nintendo Switch, and we can't play together, please... Make it cross-platform so I can play with my friends, please... Make it cross-platform!!!"
23269,"Its like crack, literally impossible to stop playing.  Just one more day they say, but then the next day all your crops are done but its a Wednesday so you cant sell them bc Pierre's is closed so you have to wait until the end of the day to see how much money you make but then its a good luck day so you gotta go to the mines and then its 3 am and you were gonna quit at 8 pm."

23305,"Get it.

If you like Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, any type of game like those, get it. It's the same as Harvest Moon games but personally, I like this one a little better? Just has more than the older games would and its hard to explain but its just great?

Great with friends, or alone. Nobody will judge. Literally is amazing in every way, shape or form. Also, its super cheap for how amazing of a game it is and how much nostalgia it gives you?"
23306,is fun
23307,"Now I'm in my farm avoiding taxes in an exotical country, ah yes the game, 10/10"
23308,"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a 2004 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the fifth main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2002's Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and the seventh installment overall. It was released in October 2004 for the PlayStation 2, in June 2005 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox, and in November 2010 for Mac OS X. The game is set within an open world environment that players can explore and interact with at their leisure. The story follows former gangster Carl ""CJ"" Johnson, who returns home following his mother's murder and is drawn back into his former gang and a life of crime while clashing with corrupt authorities and powerful criminals. Carl's journey takes him across the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas, which is heavily based on California and Nevada and encompasses three major cities: Los Santos (inspired by Los Angeles), San Fierro (San Francisco) and Las Venturas (Las Vegas)."

23319,"So simple, yet so much to do. One of the best games I've ever played. I always come back to Stardew Valley."
23320,"Good vibes that manifested into a video game. You can simp for someone and get married, or you can focus on getting Phat Stacks by grinding as much money as possible, or do both at once like a gigachad. There's nothing stopping you. There's a shocking amount of variety in this game, and the amount of playtime you get out of such a modest price tag is astounding.

If you're into slow-paced, relaxing games, this is THE game for that, and I mean that in total sincerity."
23321,"Farming, fishing, simping, the good life"

23334,"Stardew Valley is the best game ever. I've said it about other games, but Stardew will forever be my happy place. I've been playing for over a year, with my best friends who have become family now, and the memories I have made and the bonds built will last forever. Stardew Valley is a 10/10, and anybody struggling should try this game (just don't marry Haley)."
23335,"Stardew valley was the game I first played with my partner when we were getting to know each other. We needed up falling in love while making our farm. We would plant crops, fish at the beach, barely make it alive out of the mines and go to the island together. It's one of the best games I've played. It's chill, sweet and inclusive (you can be single, get married to anyone or just be friends with the magic monster). I would highly recommend this game to anyone! It's got a big place in my heart."

23344,Extremely addictive.
23345,I like the big slime :)
23346,I like Stardew Valley Becuase it is a very interactive and cool game
23347,very chill and cool game to play and relax + multiplayer is so fun + there are tons of great mods
23348,"Relaxing or Frustrating. This game is like the song "" it goes on and on my..."" what ever you want to do farm or kill some Jelly's its your call. Fight off the evil capitalist corporation or defend the hapless capitalistic town folk it got something for you!"
23349,"It may not be clear at first glance, but deep down this game simulates the life we all long for."
23350,"Years ago my sister bought an Xbox one, she barely ever used it but Stardew Valley was the one game she played more than any other. I play far more games than her far more often, but I still bought Stardew Valley on steam just so I could continue playing it. Stardew Valley is a great game for anyone regardless of how many games they play, all you need to do is relax and enjoy it.

Great to play alone, great to play with friends, great price."
23351,its like the dark souls of farmville
23352,Good game
23353,flop of the century <3
23354,great game for just relaxing. play by yourself or with friends. npcs are fun and charming. id say i enjoyed this game but i think the hours talk for itself

part of me hopes ConcernedApe will do expansions like they have done in Graveyard Keeper <3 that would make me cry <3"
23356,tis good
23357,best game music and best game ever

23362,"this game has ruined my life

screw being stressed in an fps game, I have to memorise everyone's birthdays, keep my crops all watered and then sell then, and then I have to socialise. it's like real life but the days go twice as quickly and I going to panic

10/10"
23363,"EFFICIENCY this game is punishing in its demand for efficiency - from a small, hand-watered batch of crops to crops that take an hour (in-game) to harvest along with 20 animals to pet every day before you process their products and drop the goods in the bin but hey! don't stop there cuz you'll have to find the time to explore the mine if you want to build the sprinklers to automate with, fulfill idle requests from nowhere-to-be-found citizens for petty cash, flirt with and befriend said citizens, and benefit the community through hours of fishing, crafting, adventuring, etc.  Made me a better person 10/10"
23364,This is a very fun game!!
23365,"Make it stop. I kept saying I won't play it for today, I'll take a break from it. BUT NO. 
Good game to chill tho. Tired of those competitive games? Stardew. Tired of those lengthy ass games? Stardew.
Mods are recommended too. Might be overwhelming tho.

23418,Choosing who to marry in Stardew Valley is by far the hardest decision I've ever had to make in any video game ever.
23419,
23420,Relaxing.
23421,Is neat and living the farm life.
23422,good soup
23423,"You know when you have a game that you just keep playing through, uninstalling, miss it, install it again, and repeat? This is one of my most favorite games ever. This game makes me feel at peace and that nothing is bad in the world. The story and the bonds you form with the characters are just the best things in this world. I would buy this game a thousand times. I have so many hours on the pc and switch combined that it is all that I do some days. Just hearing the opening music a feeling of nostalgia rushes over you. I would always recommend this game to anyone and can’t wait for more games from ConceredApe in the future. To the creator of this game… Thank you for bringing this joy into the world."

23425,I think if you add some weed crops to this game it would be amazing! This game simulates the happiness that I will never find in real life!
23426,"This Game is the most time consuming game I´ve played so far, and I played games like Xcom, the sims, city skylines, etc. I just know I´m going to spend an eternity playing this game.
It has everything, from farming, to minigames, to complex characters and secret quests, it has everything you want for a game about farming and I just love it
I got currently 108 hours playing and just got it a week and a half ago, so yeah. pretty adictive"
23427,Its cool game
23428,Very fun and relaxing game. :D
23429,depression go bye bye
23430,"Very laid back with plenty of mysteries, areas and characters to explore. If you like Animal Crossing, Farmville or any kind of chill style games, this is the one for you."

23438,Very fun. Has ducks and frogs. 10/10 has completely absorbed my life
23439,"This game is a lot of fun and relaxing if you enjoy farming games. If you ever played the old GBA/DS Harvest Moon games it brings out a lot of nostalgia from that but also improves on those games in so many ways. I really like the pixel art style, the map is beautiful and great to explore, and the characters have good depth/development as you increase your friendship with them. 100% recommend :)"
23440,Really good game!

23453,"good game

23454,Insane value
23455,hot emo boys
23456,"This game…holy heck it’s probs the cutest and fun game I’ve played! I have over 500 hours on it and probs would do more. Granted, there are slight flaws; like taking too long to get money to upgrade things(like house or tools etc.) and more difficult trying to find villagers' favorites. But other than that, this game is possibly the most coziest game I’ve played, aside from Sun Haven. Now, it sounds bad to compare it to a new game like that, but tbh, I’ve played games like SV and SH for many years; See it as a compliment to both creators of the games that they both made different games with the same cozy feeling game rather than a stressful and hair-pulling type of game :3 And how both their communities have cozy and kind people(minus a small few, but we dun talk about them lol). 8.5/10 from me <3"
23457,like
23458,Fantastic Game. Relax and Build up your farm how you like or go crazy and build a farming empire and make alot of money.
23459,"literally my favourite game, probably unhealthily obsessed with it at this point"

If you're looking for a challenge, this game is for you. if you're looking to play something that's not just another indie title, then you've found the right game. This was hand developed by one man, and his work is worth the product of dozens of team members. So much charm, mystery, and magic packed into one unsuspecting package of an experience. This game had me up for days on end scouring the wiki for things to do."
23466,cures depression :)))
23467,Love love love this game XD
23468,Really cool game
23469,"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST GAME EVER! Honestly though, if you're a huge harvest moon fan, then this game is for you!"

23471,Fantastic game - very relaxing and enjoyable with a lot to do.
23472,"Cute game, lots of fun stuff to do :3"
23473,Amazing game a little bit to easy but for those people who want to do less fighting and more farming and other things like that the best game you have ever downloaded.
23474,"Cute game-play, runs smoothly and always has something going on so you're never bored. Recommend highly!"

23494,"I'm not a typical gamer, and this is my first ever review so forgive this for not being the greatest written review. But I will give credit where credit is due!

I was originally recommended this game years ago as a way to help with my stress and mental health. I can confidently say that Stardew Valley has aided that enormously. This game is just so wholesome and I recommend it to anyone who wants to unwind, but like goal-oriented open-world game styles. There is so much to do and explore. I have yet to find another game like it. 10/10 would recommend."

23499,Very stress relief much flirt
23500,It is a very relaxing game. Fun to play with friends and to afk in. The game is slightly time consuming but you can take as much time as you need for the game. There is really no end to it which makes it a lot better! Wish there was other games like this!
23501,My wife left me because of I kept dating all the pixel men
23502,I am obsessed with this game 100% worth the money
23503,Where has this game been all my life?
23504,"this game shows me that i am a simple lesbian with simple needs, including a wife and cows on a nice farm in a small town"
23505,My all time favorite game. So funny and cozy.
23506,"fun, then gets old, then fun again"
23507,"Even if you don't think you enjoy games like this, give this a try, this changed the way I see this games entirely."
23508,"i love this game it is so relaxing
"
23509,the game of all time
23510,my friend recommended this game to me and i've been hooked ever since.
23511,"literally the most peaceful, mind numbing game. there's enough of a feeling of urgency to get quests done but not feel like I'm being overwhelmed. love just being a silly little farmer tending to my silly little crops"
23512,10/10 One of my favorite comfort games/games.
23513,"I absolutely love this game, super fun and so much to do. I am not a fan of the mines and I am pretty bad at fishing, but more playing is great practice. I am on year 2 and loving it! Great game!"
23514,"wow that was really cool
"
23515,Say goodbye to your life. You will only know Stardew Valley now.
23516,my friend force me to play it good !
23517,"I recommend this game for people that are stressed or need a break, this game is vary calming."
23518,fun
23519,farm is gud
23520,"Literally the coziest game of all time. If you haven't gotten this game yet, what are you doing?"
23521,A great Farming sim that is always relaxing. Co op and split screen co-op make it even better.
23522,"I love stardew valley. It's really a simple farming game, but the relationships you form with the characters is really nice. And the mines and combat systems are also really cool. 10/10"
23523,Absolutely love this game. Just wish the days were longer :(
23524,"most casual game i have ever played. its so easy to play this game for 5 hours straight while just talking to some friends or watching a show. absolutely love it

23530,Love it Love it LOVE IT!
23531,its a good game! and its great for people who are looking for the type of *farming game! 10/10
23532,"It's a fun game though it takes some getting used to. It's better when you're playing with a loved one. You often lose track of time as you farm, fish, mine and help out the villagers. The events in the game are a neat touch especially with the fact that even if you miss it, you can enjoy it next year. I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a nice and cozy time. Fair warning though for those who prefer more combat oriented games you'd likely enjoy terraria or minecraft more."
23533,"This is a super cute, relaxing game :))
10/10, would marry Shane for the 86th time."

23539,"A good game with relationships, quests, and farming."
23540,A very good and chill game! Just one problem I found in the co-op mode is that I am not able to aggressively make out with my homies. Maybe if there could be an update added to this or maybe dlc that adds this feature would be highly appreciated :)
23541,Very entertaining
23542,"Stardew Valley is a game that looks simple on the outside but has so many hidden layers and secrets. At over 100 hours I feel like there's so much more for me to experience. It has so much charm and magic, and it can be played as relaxed or as intensely as you like and you feel rewarded for either. Multiplayer adds a whole new level of fun. Highly recommended for pretty much any age."
23543,It's a great way to pass time and immerse in a 2D world with lovable characters
23544,stardew is fun and relaxing with a lot of story that gets uncovered the more you play
23545,"One of the best games ever produced. It's a labor of love from dev Eric Barone aka ConcernedApe. More than worth it's price tag by miles. 

I love this game wholeheartedly, whether if it's playing through it solo or with friends. I recommend this game to all my friends that play any genre of video games because there is something there for everyone. Whether its the lax life of just farming some crops or the intense dungeon crawling experience in the mines and caverns. The soundtrack is just beautiful and the character development is phenomenal. 

There are so many other positive things to say about this game, but you should just get into it and experience it yourself."

23550,"While I can kind of understand why people dig this game so much, my experience with it has been very unsatisfying and frustrating.

The game looks good, the sound is nice as well for the most part (some soundtracks are hardcore annoying though and there is a weird ""ghost"" moan that neither me not my friend understands).
The general idea of the game is nice as well, talk to people, farm, take care of animals etc. In reality, my farm looks exactly the same as it did when we started, slightly more crops maybe, but no coops, other buildings or anything else that could be of use. Because the thing is that everything in this game takes a lot of energy, ressources, time and money and you really have to grind in order to proceed. Nothing makes the game easier. Watering crops takes half of your energy, sprinklers are useless (they water 4 spots, wow!) and way too expensive to make sense, eating crops to have more energy is stupid because you need to make money. Doing quests is no fun either because in the rare case that you actually have what people are asking for you spend 1 or 2 complete days looking for them because you have to deliver things personally and can't just leave them/ or ship them to them. More time wasted, yay.

Befriending people is a chore as well, talking to them everyday does not seem to do anything, doing quests for them...see above. Of course you can just give them gifts but you need the money for backpack and tool upgrades and cannot waste so much on the townpeople.

After 15 hours I don't feel like I have achieved anything, my farm is still the same, people don't like me any more than they did in the beginning.

And the combat... in theory the mine might be one of the more interesting things in the game. But you are spammed with enemies sometimes and combat is just plain shit. For one enemy it might work but after lv 50 (it goes down to 100) you are just lost. For the combat to be this bad there is definitely too much of it in the game.

And don't even get me started on the absolute ABOMINATION of a fishing mini-game. There has never been anything I have hated more in any other game.

I am sure there are better farming games out there, maybe Stardew is just not for me - who knows. But I have never been able to experience the ""calming"" game Stardew Valley wants to be."
23551,"This game is everything I've need, and never knew I desired. The peace and tranquility of exploiting my farm, befriending the villagers. I highly recommend it, to anyone, of any playstyle."
23552,it reallly fun

23558,"Stardew Valley has a lot more to offer than meets the eye at first.  It's a hidden gem and has both solo and co-op modes. I like that you can easily stop if you have to, then pick it back up whenever. Recommend!"

23569,"I absolutely love Stardew Valley. It's my favorite pass-time game. On the switch version, I have 79 hours on one farm, and still find ways to customize and do new things with my farm. The art style is nice to look at and the colors pop out of the screen! :D"
23570,At first I thought this game sucked. After giving some time and trying to understand this game I absolutely fell in love with this game. This game is a bit complex at first but you'll learn everything you need eventually and Stardew Valley wiki is your best friend.
23571,One of the best games I played!
23572,"Easy dynamic, but engaging enough to keep interest :)"
23573,This is possibly one of the best games I have EVER played
23574,funny game
23575,"Where the AAA gaming space often lets us down, Small teams and in this case a single dev and their Indie projects show just how much creativity and passion their still is in the industry.

Super cozy game that's always a fun and relaxing time logging on to play, so much content and variety with regular free updates added throughout the years. It can take some time to get into the swing of things, the game does start quite slowly but that's not necessarily a bad thing. You'll soon have plenty to do once you have your farm up and running.

You have a bunch of plants to sow depending on the season, animals to care for, decorating your home, trees to cut, fishing, townsfolk to interact with the list goes on. customizing and slowly building up to my dream farm was just a really fun time highly recommend this game if you want to chill with something casual, and i say this as a competitive gamer.

The game oozes quality, care and passion, and for such a low price you really can't go wrong."
23576,Best farming game ever made.
23577,farm

The game is beautifully done. The amount of marvelous story that still allows for freedom is impeccable. If you love slow-paced, calming games- get it. I've never had a bad experience with this game."
23579,its a good relaxing game
23580,"I have never invested so much time into one game( I have this on 3 other platforms).... Stardew is literally AMAZING! When my sister showed it to me I was like oh yeah cute little farming game ill do this for a bit.... OH BOY was it so much more. The back stories to each character, BRILLIANT!
The vibin tunes!! SO CHILL.
It's just SO much more then I thought it would be. can't get enough! 
EPIC change of pace from kill or be killed. 
Definitely one of my top games! 10/10 DO RECOMMEND!"

23612,Its a really great game! Incredibly fun and relaxing at the same time. Sometimes you don't even notice that some time has passed by. You can even play it in multiplayer which doubles the fun! except when your friend spends all your money to pursue their favorite marriage candidate at the start of the game :( Oh did I mention that you can also date and marry NPCs too well yeah. I VERY MUCH RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYBODY!

if you dissapointed of the new Harvest Moon or Story of Season franchise, go get Stardew Valley (it's worth every penny and your time)."
23618,Relaxing game
23619,"Love the game, wish the creator would stop putting women up on a pedestal. Every female character is perfect - even their flaws are just opportunities for growth that they absolutely capitalize on. The men, on the other hand, are all bums and jerks who just get worse if you marry them. Kinda makes for a crap experience if you want to go after a dude."

23622,"I first played this game in the height of the pandemic on the nintendo switch and I automatically fell in love with the game. I loved everything from farming to building relationships with the villagers of Stardew Valley. I can always play this game whenever I need to cool off or when I'm in the mood for something calm. Recently I bought this on PC and oh boy after playing the Vanilla version of the game I recommend downloading mods as it can heighten your experience. 10/10, genuinely one of the best games ever made"

23631,.
23632,I can't stop. It's like the updated version of Harvest Moon
23633,This is one of the best games of all time. You can play this game however you want. Truly. You want to play slow and enjoy cultivating the farm? Do it! Want to speed run in the mines? Do it. This is the game that got me through 2020 and I'm still playing it. It's really like a breath of fresh air.
23634,"One of my favorite games all-time. Extremely wholesome, My game of forever. I can easily see myself playing this game a decade from now and I assure you I would not feel different about it at that time. I can give numerous compliments to this game, but what stands out to me is the pure ability of this game to allow me to either play it rigorously, or be in a call with friends but still stay on-track and my enjoyability is consistent."

This game is worth playing, especially if you just want to relax and enjoy a pleasant farming game. Stardew Valley is a game that can get tedious at times, but even in those moments, it can be entertaining. Overall, if this game sounds like something you'd enjoy playing, I would strongly advise you to purchase it."
23638,"Love this game. It's like every miserable, young office worker's fever dream. Relative passes and leaves you their farm. You build up your farm, woo the townsfolk, and delve into the mines to kill monsters and get resources. You can carefully plan (with help from the wiki) for the great satisfaction of making grandpa proud, or you can stumble around and figure it out as you go. Highly recommended."
23639,"yes farm have bab, beautif"
23640,"Its a great unwinding game honestly lol im not gonna lie the characters are great and it shows with characters (such as shane and alex) That with shane not everything is good and with alex, just because they act tough does not mean nothing is wrong."

23665,Good Game.
23666,My gay self loves this mf game </3 11/10
23667,"Stardew is an amazing little Indie game that's both peaceful, at at the same time mentally challenging. You need to be smart by how you plant your crops, how you make your relationships and spend your time if your goal is to make certain milestones by certain points. Otherwise you can just enjoy the ride; make your dream farm or focus on mining and fishing as a source of income. The most annoying thing to me is the holidays, especially when I need to leave my farm for something and I accidentally go to the screen where it's being held and I'm forced to socialize."
23668,Its very fun

I will often spend hours just going through the days cause its so fun. You really get to choose what you make of this game, and that is my favorite part! <3"
23715,Explaining my 2021 summer in 1 game
23716,"This game just gets better and better. The community is probably what makes it so fun. I love that we're able to mod the game if desired, but even the base vanilla game is packed with so much great content that it's worth playing at least once before modding in any way. Years later, and I'm still playing. Definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys a great story, item collection/building, and rpg elements in a game."
23717,The perfect game for pretending to have a happy life!

23725,"This game stresses me out. I needed to work on it harder than in my day job. It needs automation. I know there is a mod for that, but I don't know that when I started to farm my ass out :D"

23732,A game of this quality made by a single person is a slap on the face for AAA studios.
23733,"Great game to play and relax in between other games. Supports coop as well, so you can share your farm life with someone"

23748,"Calming, definitely a came you just chip at but luckily I love those types of games!"
23749,"Lovely game that is easily grindable. Not for everyone, but if you enjoyed Animal Crossing and other sim games, you'll really like Stardew Valley."
23750,This game takes what is good about older farming sims and puts a bit of challenge and transparency with the basic gist of the game.  Even now with my 80+hours on PC and 400+ hours on everything else I'm still finding new things to enjoy about the game!
23751,"this game is amazing, everything from the Gameplay down to the relaxing feel of the game i highly recommend this to people who want a causal experience or who just want a relaxing game to play, it takes a little grinding to get to the good parts but it's totally worth it, so i hope that you have as much fun as I've been having also fuck you marnie for not working everyday of the week, my chickens have starved multiple times because of you. Anyway have fun with the game and happy farming"

23757,"The graphics put me off this game at first -- I have no nostalgia for low-res graphics. But this game has so much to do. I have saves on Nintendo Switch, on Steam, and on the PS4/PSVita."
23758,good
23759,"A super fun sandbox farm/town sim. It's not an overly-complicated game, But there are enough hidden surprises and replay value to make it worth playing over and over. Throw in multiplayer and you may find yourself spending a year or more primarily playing Stardew Valley. 20/10."

23767,"I enjoyed this game completely until recently. got to yr 2 winter, upgraded my house for the second time only to wake up and my workbench and the 2 of the chests around it are gone. frustrating enough that i'm going to put this down for a bit. Who would be motivated to play if everything you need to progress can disappear when you go to bed?"
23768,"I have loved this game, it took me a couple hours to get into the rhythm of playing and how to play (YouTube and Stardew Valley database app were so helpful), now I am hooked and love playing, both on my own world and on worlds with my friends and we can play together is AWESOME! I really like that even after playing for many hours there are still things to do and explore and lots to come of the map and story that I have yet to find/experience."
23769,good game
23770,"best game ever, super relaxing, not for everyone tho, a bit slow paced, you can do fighting in the mines if thats what you like though"

23777,SO EPIC
23778,"Best stress-relief faring Indie game out there :3 it is so relaxing and fun!

The creator, Concerned Ape, definitely put his all and passion into it."
23779,I enjoy this game because it is calming to play and it is fun to play with friends. I will say the only thing I don't like is fishing. Not the most fun thing to do. Overall it is a great game!

23782,Fire can like farm n shi
23783,"Here is my big review that covers some of the story (no spoilers) and some of the aspects of the game. This is really long because I have a need to write about something.
Stardew Valley is a single or multiplayer RPG, indie, and adventure game. It's about the story of a young farmer who inherited the land of their grandfather in a small place called Pelican Town. At the beginning of the game you can customize your character with many different shirts, hairs, and pants with customizable colors, and you can choose any name, favorite thing, and preferred pet. Yes, you can adopt a dog or a cat. In the game you can grow crops and raise farm animals on your new land, and build it however you like. Pelican Town has a ton of townies (NPCs) in it. Each townie has their own storyline and lore along with them along with many quests and rewards. Throughout the seasons, there are different events that mimick the ones of real life. Like an easter egg hunt for example. The game also has fishing, mining, fighting, and a lot of resource gathering. You will need to end up doing all of these things to finish the big goal of the game which is the community center. In the town there is a run down community center that the mayor will want to fix. You will need to donate some crops, foraged items, resources, fish, animal products, and cooked items to finish this quest. Once the community center is complete, the world is completely free to explore and roam, and you can find all the different pieces of story and collect every exotic item in the game. Stardew Valley is very calming and stress free -until you go to the mines- and any and all stress is avoidable. It has a great soundtrack that sets the mood and great characters you will (literally) fall in love with. This is a great game :D
If you read all that congrats to you i just rambled on about it cause its a good game. That is all the proof you need :) its worth all the dollars you will have to pay."

23809,"Honestly, coming to stardew valley at first, I was sceptical, I never really enjoyed games like that before, but I gave it a shot, AND I GOT HOOKED. the game is so amazing, with so many features you sometimes forget its a farming simulator at times, its honestly so immersive I spent 60 hours on my save and im not even 20% done with the game, I havent played it that much lately but I had at one point 50 hours in 2 weeks!!!! this game is so addictive and I really love it, I love this game sm, and I love all the characters in it (except Pierre, Lewis and Morris these 3 suck af)

23862,"Great fun! Go at your own pace and explore, plant, create and mine. I've spent a crazy number of hours in this game and am still surprised by the secrets and mysteries that I stumble across. Absolutely worth every penny. Can't wait to see what the next game from this developer will be!"
23863,.
23864,fun :)
23865,its a really calm and fun game
23866,chill
23867,THIS GAME COULD MAKE ME CCCCCUUUUUMMMMM ITS SO FUN ON MY MOMMMA
23868,good
23869,I've been playing this for the past 72 hours straight. Eyes glued to the screen. I haven't eaten or gotten up from my chair once. My girlfriend is terrified. I can't move my legs. I can only farm. Farm. I farm.
23870,based game sebastian is very pretty
23871,good
23872,Its a really fun laid back game
23873,"Absolutely amazing game! I generally have problems with games having little to do other than a main story, but this game has so many outcomes to everything you do. Honestly, I'll probably hit a few hundred hours before the year is up."
23874,"ive been off and on this game and it always seems like i just keep coming back. its a very good game for when you feel like you have no control of your life and it just makes you feel good inside when you get somewhere in your game. my complaints are that i wish there was a little more dialogue with some of the characters given that their lives are supposed to be changed by the farmer. i hope to be able to spend more time in this game. ive bought it twice, once for PC and once for the Nintendo Switch. i also follow groups on facebook about stardew valley. its a very good game but requires some patience."
23875,I'm writing this drunk but holy shit Stardew Valley is the most relaxing amazing experience you will ever encounter on steam. This game can take your shitty stressful life and turn it into something worth enjoying and that's really something. I definitely recommend playing single player because pausing the time in every menu and having all income go into one bank account is definitely helpful but multiplayer can still be fun. This game is so great to play when you just want to relax and not stress about anything. I recommend this game if you hate fucking life and just want a break from the stress and anxiety of working a minimum wage full time piece of shit job that makes you question whether life is really worth living. Because of developers that make games like this it is.
23876,Stardew Valley is a fun. I love it. Nice. Sweet game.
23877,love this game it is so cozy and fun to play!
23878,It's a cute farming sim that allows you to build a farm and have fun getting to know the characters in game.  definitely recommended.

23901,It's as good as everyone says it is.
23902,yes
23903,This game is straight up addicting. My favorite feature about it is the fact you can have MLM or WLW relationships with accurate responses. And then the fact almost every single character in the game has a backstory you get to find out about and experience your own memories with leaves the game with so much you get to learn that you'll never get bored of it. Thank you for such an amazing game!

23931,"Seems like you need to know a complete wiki to play this game, but actually if you pay attention you can complete your Spain taxes simulator: Scholar of the first Andalusian. Very fun game if you wanna disconnect your brain from reality, by the way dating in this game with someone is more complicated than in real life, everyone is a gold digger."

23965,"One of the best games I've ever played. It's so simple but holds a lot of depth and character development. Shane's story line is absolutely heartbreaking and well thought out. If you're bored of the game in the first hour or so, keep going and exploring and the ball will definitely start rolling.... everything about Stardew Valley is perfect, it has my heart."

24005,virtual woman makes heart happy
24006,I am sure i clocked in more hours than this as I have played this offline a lot. I got all the way to Year 4 before the CO-OP and variants of landmarks were released. This game brings back a lot of really nice memories and I would never mind playing them again with my friends.

24008,yeah it's good
24009,"If you grew up with harvest moon and want to enjoy it again in all of it's glory or just looking for a game to chill and lose yourself in for hours, this game is for you.

24038,"very fun, can sacrifice baby"

24042,"It is a great game with a lot of replayability.  Now my first time playing it I got a bit obsessed with optimizing crop production and maximizing profits, but that doesn't have to be you.  Just relax and enjoy it, and maybe play with a few friends."

24053,"I have well over 1200 hours on this game on the switch due to 2020. I would say yes, i enjoy it..."
24054,The mines is too scary for me.
24055,"I was never into the pixelart and ""jarpg"" style games, but I love gardening and nature so I decided to try this out. It seemed overrated at first, like, what's so special about this little farming game?

I have to say, this is now my happy place besides skyrim and minecraft. It's so relaxing, fun, and the characters and their development will make you cry. I didn't expect to get emotional over a game but I teared up over a scene because it was just so beautiful and peaceful.

The gameplay itself is addicting. It feels so satisfying to do so much hard work farming, digging, chopping, feeding animals, etc, and getting rewarded for it by selling or using what you've created. Reminds me of how it feels to have your hard work paid off irl after breaking your back tilling soil and raising plants.

The music is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. The visuals are really nice. The only problem I have is that while in the mines, having to mine every single rock or blow them up to find the ladder to the next level is SUPER annoying. But that's literally the only flaw I can find with it.

I hope you give it a try, you won't regret it."
24056,Found a trash fish in a garbage can and brought it to Jodi's house for dinner.
24057,fun
24058,A Harvest Moon type feel that has so much more to offer. Really enjoy these types of games and play with my husband and siblings all the time.
24059,"If I could only play one game for the rest of my life, I'd pick this one. There are so many different ways you can play this game. You can push yourself to earn a lot of money, or to finnish a challenge or quest as fast as possible. Or you marry different NPCs to find out what their 14 heart event cut scene is. Or you decorate your farm and pet your cows. It's as challenging or relaxing how you want it. And as a plus, the Reddit Community is super welcoming if you have questions.

~ DIFFICULTY ~

☑️ Easy (Fishing is hard in the beginning, but gets easier. Food buffs help, e.g. from fish tacos. Same with fighting in the mines. Otherwise there aren't many possibilities to fail)

🔲 Well written
🔲 Epic story

~ PRICE ~

🔲 Free
☑️ Under priced (I don't know the price range for games of this kind, but you can play it for an endless amount of time, so I think the price is a bit low)

One of my favorite games of all time, and I'm pretty sure that'll never change. 
Forever playable <3"
24069,There is nothing more good I can say about this game that hasn't been good. But it is utterly fantastic and one of the best written games you can play on the market.
24070,"There is lots to do in this game. The world is relatively small which gives it a great community vibe. You feel like you know the town, the settings, the locations. Its fun to play with friends and solo as well. Also you can hatch dinosaurs 10/10"
24071,"I used to play this game with my girlfriend. We built our farm, took care of the animals, fished and got married. I had really good times with her.
Sadly, we broke up last month, and this was the last game we played together, but the memories of the good times are still in my heart.
Our farm is still there, but the winter will never pass.
I hope she's okay, and I hope I'll be okay too.
Thank you for the memories. Take care."
24072,yes.
24073,great game really recommend
24074,This is good
24075,"If you thought Harvest Moon was unreasonably difficult and complex, this is the farming sim for you! The base game alone has hours and hours of content that you can play at any pace and in a multitude of ways (I've played the base game for longer on my Switch than I have on my modded PC game), which can vastly alter your playtime. 

Mods can give you an entirely re-imagined experience, extend the existing gameplay, add extra features, or simply patch existing ones for accessibility. It's extremely versatile and allows you to create a unique experience for yourself, almost as if the postgame of your first playthrough is a sandbox.

This game will hold up forever. Get it! You won't regret it, unless you're a big boy macho gamer bro who doesn't like to have fun."

If you are the kind of person who does not mind a more pixel art style and a 2D like play style then i would recommend this game to you as it is very fun and has so much content to it other than just farming. You really can not go wrong here!"

I'd recommend this game to anyone."
24122,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this one yet!

1-4 player farming simulator with 3 in game years of contents and so
much more from inside mods! I'm quite fond of just sometimes getting
together a few friends and starting a new farm all over again just because
the started weeks and slowing building up the farm is so enjoyble.
And all the time in between events is peaceful and can be spent farming, 
fishing, building, or doing whatever all the while you can talk to you friends
and relax

120/120 Remeber to save up for strawberries"
24123,greatest farming game that is simple and relaxing
24124,Just a fun game with a lot of content to spend hours diving into!
24125,Only game where I'm not tilted.
24126,"This game is really fun as you have to plant all your crops, give them fertilizer and water, and plan for the seasons! After a bit, you can collect sprinklers to water crops for you and the greenhouse to be able to plant crops in any season. Many of the crops are season-dependent which I think is a really nice aspect of the game as it makes you really plan things out! There are many enjoyable things to do such as events, friendships, farming, mining, fishing, collecting, and so much more which just gives this game so much to do!"
24127,"The game is very cute! It catches your attention with the well-done pixel art, and holds you with the story. There might not be a ""main"" questline, but the many small quests that help you understand the world of Stardew are (if you read the text..) wholesome and intriguing. As you progress, so does the valley. The different areas in the game keep it interesting and spice it up when you get to the more end-game content, where you're just farming every day. The game not only has soft and calming gameplay, it also has puzzles. There are some pretty confusing ones I've yet to figure out. But I'm excited to! Overall, this game is really enjoyable, and very worth the small amount of money you pay for it."
24128,its cool bc im gay and lonely

24151,sus game
24152,Its a fantastic game. From Farming to mining. Fishing to Cooking...so much fun to progress through
24153,"I love how much free will you have! IT is just so fun to be able to do whatever you want to do on a farm. They also have by far the best NPCs I have ever seen in any game. This is game is even better when you remember how much it is, only 15$, this high quality for a pixel game should be at least 40! But the best part about it is all of its amazing features! If you are on the fence about this game or you have spare money, I highly recommend this game."
24154,Super relaxing game. I love seeing the farm change throughout the different seasons :3
24155,I have nothing to say that hasn't been said. The game is absolutely fantastic. Easy to mod as well.

24242,Best game i have played in a long time
24243,"Stardew Valley is the game that takes me back to my childhood of playing Harvest Moon on the Gameboy advance. It's a great relaxing game to play after the violent and competitive games you have on your library. Good music, good pixel art, story lines for the characters are great, gameplay loop of farming/taking care of animals is actually quite enjoyable and never got stale for me. Combat mechanics are good but not the best. There's so much you can do that I can't mention here. +you can do all that with friends! +++ ALL OF THIS WAS MADE BY ONE GUY! 

[h1] 4/5 [/h1]"
24244,this is the best game ever u cannot change my mind.
24245,good
24246,very wholesome :)

24256,"39 hours online, closer to 1k offline. If you want something to just put your mind to ease; I highly doubt you will ever find a more relaxing game."
24257,A very in depth game that will leave you finding new things every day. I personally hate the combat and think restricting combat to 4 directions was stupid. Combat could have been way more in depth if there was more directionality (is that even a word?) to it.
24258,yee yee farm fuck the animals they so godamn needy bro
24259,Fun to play solo or with friends! Love that there is alot of characters to interact with and form relationships with.

24267,"Very nice game, gameplay and characters are lovely and unique (except for Elliott) and there are many unique things you can do between farming dozens of different crops, growing mushrooms, mining,  getting married, simping for emos, giving Elliott trash, growing mushrooms, having a pet cat or dog, giving Elliott trash, having kids, rummaging through garbage, harassing the Mayor, giving Elliott trash, fishing, collecting artifacts, and growing mushrooms. 

mushroom/10 recommend, like this if you hate Elliott's stupid face :>"

24298,Amazing game! The amount of detail is just breathtaking.
24299,"HONESTLY this is one of the best games I have ever played. It brings me infinite joy, and I discover new things to love all the time. I have it on 3 systems with a total of 4 save files, because I am able to play differently each time and really create my own experience. I love this game."
24300,I love how there is so much more than meets the eye to stardew valley. It is open-ended and allows for hours of enjoyment. There's always something new to discover!
24301,love itttt
24302,cute farms <3
24303,"This game is like a home away from home. I've always been a big fan of Animal Crossing, and though AC and SDV are so alike, you'll find they have many differences. Both games are primarily non-combat oriented. Stardew Valley does have mines which involve combat, but they aren't central to the gameplay. In most cases, you'll be collecting goods, and interacting with the townspeople. In both games, you customize your own home. In SV, you plant crops and use various tools. In AC, you customize your home with furniture and room dressings. You can also customize your town with various public works projects. 

In both games you can easily imagine leaving a stressful life behind for a more serene and simple one outside the country. Usually, I primarily play competitive shooters, but this game is a great way for me to relax afterwards. You can tell the developers put a lot of love and care into this game. I highly recommend it."
24304,"I grew up playing the Harvest Moon series and a number of spin offs. I love Stardew Valley so much that I own it on multiple platforms. I have no issues dropping $15 here and there to just be able to playing wherever and on whatever device.

Stardew Valley offers a lot of content to keep you busy just like the Harvest Moon games and arguably gives a little more freedom in your life choices throughout the game.

My only complaint is the lack of calendar events in game and the lack of NPC character engagement in the end game. This game never really ends, but it would be nice to have a number of dialogues or activities you could engage in with characters instead of exhausting every character dialogue to be left with just maintaining your farm for the rest of eternity."
24305,gud
24306,fun c:
24307,I like much
24308,Very fun and a great time killer! <3
24309,"It's wholesome, addictive, with cute animals and creatures, you always have something to do, every goal the game sets is exciting and challenging, you can have kids, it's a perfect combination between a farming sim and fantasy, the pixel art is excelent, and overall, everything was well thought, truly a game designed with love and passion."
24310,I heard about this game a long time ago but I always ignored it because it looked like something that was just cutesy. I finally pulled the trigger on buying it and... I'm in love. This is basically Harvest Moon +. Like if Harvest Moon got implants and a butt lift.
24311,Love this game! its honestly such a beautiful little game. Fishing is one of my fav things to do and i love to watch my farm grow. Making friendships/relationships with the villagers is also so much fun :). Cant wait for confused apes next game to come out! Should be with in the next year or two :)
24312,Probably one of the best games I've ever played.
24313,"Great gameplay, great soundtrack and pleasant stories, this game is awesome."
24314,balls
24315,"Its so good ajkfhksjhfdkjshd! I love the characters, the art, and the gameplay. This is in my top few games. I guess if I had to describe it, it would be like a cross between Minecraft and animal crossing."
24316,its really fun ans theres a lot of things to do!
24317,"While this game can get monotonous, it's also perfect for relaxing! The artwork is fantastic, the characters are lovely and unique -- which are just a few of the things that keep me coming back to play over and over."
24318,"fun game to relax and calm down, but way too many npcs"
24319,"I played this for hundreds of hours on console. I bought this on Steam to continue the game with mods that expand it to be even more than it already was. If you've never played this, buy it."
24320,
24321,hola
24322,"It's a wonderful game if you're looking for a good time with your friends, and even if you're playing solo, it's very soothing to play alone.

I would highly recommend this to people who would like to just relax and have fun!"
24323,"At first, I wasn't sure if I liked it, but it's worth giving the game a chance, it's really fun and addictive, and I highly recommend it."
24324,<3
24325,It's just fun.
24326,"Obviously, judging by my hours, I love this game. I don't know why it has taken me so long to leave a review, but I highly recommend this game to all who will listen to me!"
24327,its gud
24328,"Excellent game for those who like a lot relaxing sandbox/farming games. Mods can even help by adding a lot of content for those who don't want to stay playing the vanilla game, tho even the vanilla game is enough to spend hours on end playing. 
Be it by changing your farm, developing relationships with the characters, foraging/mining/fishing to complete the objectives or even play more lightly here and there, you rarely get bored and can always find something to do, which is rare in games of this type and range.
Overall a really good game with relaxing music, i recommend :)"
24329,Don't play with friends all they do is judge your significant other choice :(
24330,farming food and fucking haley
24331,Litterally I play this game almost daily. Same sorta addictive taste of ACNH however less monotanist and not real world bound. All types of players can get into this game try it at least its cheaper than most games and yet more playable.
24332,Ɛ>
24333,Game good
24334,good
24335,The game I ALWAYS go back to. Everything about it is perfect.
24336,"I like the combat system and the hugging chickens part.

I don't like how it takes effort to build relationships with the other villagers like plz I'm a gamer I already don't have a life and I play this game to escape from my responsibilities as a human being so why do I have to give them stuff and actually talk to them (please note this is a joke, except for the part where I want to escape from responsibilities. that part is true)"
24337,A game you can grind or play really chill and chat with friends. Play co-op or solo
24338,"Chill game, i like it"
24339,"Stardew Valley lets you live the millennial fantasy of having more than three friends in your twenties, owning property, and having a stable income."
24340,i want change my citizenship to stardew valley
24341,"Community is cool, game is fun. there are many things to do ."
24342,the farming and all the animals are so cool and i love this game if you like farming fishing etc. you should play this game <3
24343,make you want to keep going

24347,"i love stardew valley, i cannot stop playing"
24348,"vibe
"
24349,time flys when playing this game!
24350,"i now own stardew valley on 3 different platforms. pc, android and ios.. (long story) but i love being able to just plop on the couch with it and just relax. 

now having played this game exclusively on tablets and such it is quite frankly baffling me why the click-to-move-and-pick-the-right-tool-to-do-action isn't available for the pc version of the game. i thought i could just lean back in my chair and one-hand my way through this game like on the tablet, but alas, i have to use either a controller (preferred as it supports the more lounge-able positions) or wasd and mouse to move about. 

this presents some problems, 1 aiming where i place my swings, plots and plants and 2 when you get attacked in the mines you have to actually aim.
i know that is mostly player preference and how i got used to playing it on a tablet but this game so lends itself to just being pointy clicky.
another thing that gets my gears grinding is the terrible fishing ui. it's designed so it gets easier to catch fish if you have a higher fishing level but it is near screen-punchingly frustrating to fish at low levels.

you can play by just being a hermit and mope around your farm with minimal connection with the people in the town or just go nuts and have kids. 
there is no YOU HAVE WON or YOU LOOSE mentality in this game. do what you like seems to be the option.
complete the bundels, or not. the game is okay with it.

just don't stay out after 2 am or you will get robbed by the locals.
"
24351,smapi all the way
24352,I own this game on everything it can be downloaded on and i will buy it again! This game is absolutely amazing! 100/10
24353,best game ever
24354,This game is special
24355,"I absolutely LOVE this game. I'm almost 1300 hours in and I'm still finding new things to do and discovering things I've never seen before. 
If you're looking for something chill and therapeutic, with lots of things to explore and figure out this game is definitely for you. Regular updates have also added a ton of content to this game, making it fun to re-start and explore anew. 
As it gets a bit sandboxy towards the end, it's also a great game to play if you enjoy setting up challenges for yourself, or starting over with specific goals in mind as you play. Very enjoyable to play with friends as well.

Someone once asked me why this game had gotten me so hooked I keep returning to it, and I think it's because it's just so calming and welcoming, it's like getting a big warm hug when you feel down. It just goes so well with my Sunday morning coffee.

10/10 - I will HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who enjoys this genre."

24365,"Did you ever want to experience the feeling of relaxation and comfy while at your PC? 
Do you desire a break from countless slamming your head against the brick wall of punishing command input windows?
Do you want to pet a cat or dog?
Come on down to Stardew Valley! You might find at least one of these things here!

Truly my relax and unwind game."

 Proof that fancy graphics and big brand names aren't all that important as long as you put a little bit of love into your games.

 Engaging gameplay... Beautiful art-style... Hell, you can even get married to a purple haired lady! (optional)

What else do you need?
"
24379,"There is a lot to do in this game. Like a lot. You can farm, forage, craft, simp, mine, fight, cook, fish, and more. This game is just really fun. Carnivals and holidays are always fun. The music is amazing. The game is just great. Buy it.

Amazing game"
24387,"Very epic fun time with friends
"
24388,shane is hot tbh
24389,Highly engaging and deeply thought out gameplay and progression. Art style is really nice and it's not hard to miss some assets due to contrast issues. Interacting with some objects like message boards can be a little finicky. I'd also like it if in co-op two people can explore the same chest at the same time. Maybe as a toggleable option by the host.

24421,"Is it fate?
If it's not easy, it must not be
At that age
I cherished the flowers beneath my feet
But then something must have changed in me
I used to feel so light
Now I'll try
I just want time
Wait again
I will be much better then
Holding on, I said
""I will be much better, then""
Look at the sky, I'm still here
I'll be alive next year
I can make something good, oh
Something good
Look at the sky, I'm still here
I'll be alive next year
I can make something good, oh
Something good
Are you close?
Shouldn't it come to you naturally?
And everyone knows
You're losing your gift, and it's plain to see
But then something must have changed in me
I don't fear it anymore
Now I'm sure
I'm sure
Look at the sky, I'm still here
I'll be alive next year
I can make something good, oh
Something good
Look at the sky, I'm still here
I'll be alive next year
I can make something good, oh
Something good
Wait again, I will be much better then
And suddenly, I've restored your faith in me
Look at the sky
Look at the sky, I'm still here
I'll be alive next year
I can make something good, oh
Something good
Look at the sky, I'm still here
I'll be alive next year
I can make something good
Something good
Look at the sky, I'm still here
I'll be alive next year
I can make something good

24448,Badass
24449,"you can be *gay*
this is the best farm game ever, you cant change my mind"
24450,"Pros: 
-Characters each with a different unique personality, that you can date/marry/become platonic roommates with.
-Unique non-dateable characters with great plot lines and personalities.
-So. Much. Exploration.
- Great Achievement system to work towards, and to keep playing for.
-So many different ways to play, farming, fishing, animal keeping, mining, decorating, and combat.
-A lot of replayablity

Cons:
-Definitely gets grindy
-Once you get to end game, it does get stale, and you will have to get creative to make it fun, or just start over.
-Difficulty spike towards an mid/endgame combat/mining area, It seems too difficult to traverse at first.

Overall I've beyond enjoyed this game, and I still haven't beaten it. I definitely recommend at least giving it a try, especially if you are into a farming sim/rpg style game. However, it will get grindy in a lot of spots, and you will have to be creative during those times. Overall though, a really well rounded game with lots of things to work towards and discover."
24451,i love this game and you can add mods in nexus mod it so great i can stop playing to game to good my god
24452,most relaxing and wholesome game in a long time.

It's been quite a long time, over 700 hours and it has been the game I have truly enjoyed my time with the most.  This game holds a special place in my heart and I'm so thankful to the developer for their hard work and dedication to the project.  The true labor of love that this game was for them shines through in so many ways.  Thank you for the experience and the journey."

24494,"Stardew Valley is one of my favorites games of all time and possibly the most joy I have ever gotten from $15 spent. It was made by one man as an homage to the Harvest Moon games and as a result of that, absolutely everything about it is full to the brim with passion and personality and charm. This game has so much heart, and offers players a lovely peaceful place to escape to when life feels overwhelming. It's wonderful to play by yourself or experience with friends and really I cannot recommend it enough"

24505,The sex scenes are awesome!
24506,Very epic

24508,This game is fun especially when you have the option to play with friends and build your own farm. also the story is almost endless depending on your choices
24509,It's really good.
24510,broke boy farms and goes into more debt life is fun :D
24511,I am in love with this game! Its so addictive. There is always something to do and you can play how ever you would like. I got my friend hooked on it and he hates pixel games. 10/10
24512,The best farming sim game.
24513,"All the best parts of animal crossing and terraria put together,  literally addicted to this game, very comforting, the joys of simplicity and yet there is constantly things to do and little secrets to figure out! love it."
24514,Great Game.
24515,"I had always heard great things about the game and wanted to try it, but never did. I got it on my XBOX once but I had no idea how to play it (because I skipped over the basic story at the beginning) I wasn't a fan at first but as soon as I got my PC I decided to give it another go. I am absolutely in love with this game. It has such a wide demographic of players and has the cutest storyline. Even if you are not super into management games it is so much more than that, exploration, mining, quests. Stardew Valley is definitely worth trying."
24516,"After 700 hours, it's safe to say that this is my favorite game ever. Relaxing, but always interesting. It keeps you interested all the time."

24520,"I personally have ADHD, and my brain has found a way to hyperfixate on this game, I have made it farther in this game in a week then I have in months, and it's incredibly fun. It's like if animal crossing had like a crossbreed with pokemon in a sense, and it's amazing and the updates just make it more fun, I can't wait to make it to ginger island and expand my farm further."

24525,"this game is one of my absolute favorites, no matter what kind of games i find myself playing i always come back to stardew. i highly recommend to anyone who's okay or enjoys slower starts to games and gradually growing fond of a world and it's people! (i love this game so much i bought it a second time for my switch... it's seriously amazing)"
24526,i like
24527,"I was between Stardew Valley and Animal Farm. I opted for Stardew Valley, it's an okay game but the genre is not really my thing. No violence, no nudity. I think those are essential in a game. But it was fun growing a farm and there is the combat aspect if you go to the caves, which the game soon or later forces you to go. Overall good experience, but not worth my time."
24528,"The basic gameplay has pretty much everything I'm looking for in a farming sim: crop planning, resource management, processing for value-add, a nice hand-drawn feel to the animation, and a cozy feel to the storyline. The courting and marriage options are wide open, which is nice, although you have to use a mod to have a polycule. The modding process is relatively painless. I find I only want a couple of mods, one to get rid of the twitch-gamer fishing minigame that I can't do, I'm old, and one to expand the cellar to the size of the house. The farm maps offer enough variation in strategy to keep me entertained for a while. 451 hours and I'm only on my third farm map, that's good replay value."
24529,"game is very fun, much recomend
"
24530,chill af
24531,suspiciously addicting
24532,It's a pretty great chill game if you're lookin to just chill out and be stuck in your own head for a bit. I recommend the use of mods to either add up to the content of the game or for aesthetic purposes.

It has all of the aspects that the best harvest moon games but there's also more intense story arcs with the characters, more secrets than you'd ever find in HM and so much more content for you to explore. Its a well balanced game with near infinite replayablility and its so highly addicting"

There are many different skills and aspects of the game such as, farming, mining, combat, fishing, and foraging. Its a nice game, and you can interact with other townsfolk and even marry those who have not been married yet. There are two main goals.

However, scientists estimate the universe contains approximately 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, or a septillion.   While no one can actually count every single grain of sand on the earth, the estimated total from researchers at the University of Hawaii, is somewhere around seven quintillion, five hundred quadrillion grains.  That is an awfully big sand castle!"
24606,it's a good game
24607,"Very relaxing to play even if in solo mode and time really flies fast when you play it
10/10 recommend for anyone who loves simulation games and such~"
24608,Good time with my gf.
24609,Addictive af.
24610,After playing for awhile I would recommend this for anyone who needs to relax in trying to play other games. In the beginning I was frustrated because of no information on what I was doing. I am still having problems because the help program from Steams other players think you are up as high as they are in the game. The mistakes you make are many and you can't correct them. As for the time line on doing certain things you have to do in the game is BAD. For one thing you don't have the resources to do them and HELP is BAD from the information they give you in the game and from so-called GAMERS!
24611,"Just married my girlfriend, kinda funky"
24612,
24613,"the lore, soundtrack i mean everything. The game is amazing you don't feel alone and etc. I like to escape here if i feel down"

My favorite thing about this game is that you can play and enjoy the game by focusing on the parts that you enjoy. You are not required to do anything that you don't find fun. The game is self-paced and you don't have to play every day. The mods for this game are fantastic also, because this game has such an amazing community!"

24662,Good stuff
24663,"What can I say that hasn't already been said. A great game to kick back, relax (or get emotional) with. Played well over 100 hours just on this version alone.

Plus the modding scene is booming. If the base content isn't enough for ya, there's plenty of well made fan-made content to enjoy."
24664,"Stardew Valley is so cute and cozy, and makes me miss summers in the south, helping my grandpa harvest. 10/10 <3"

24705,"They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for."
24706,Amazing game!
24707,I do not know how but this game become the best game to me. It keeps you busy and it's the biggest time killer of all times. And not look at me slowly becoming a redneck. This game changed my whole perspective on farming and I'm glad it did. Highly recommend this game!
24708,i like farm and plant
24709,Amazing simulator game if you just want to sit back and relax 👍
24710,good
24711,"fun, relaxing."
24712,fun farming game
24713,Absolutely love this game. First started playing on my Switch around xmas. My friends told me about a bunch of cool mods I could add if I had the PC version so I downloaded it. Haven't touched my Switch ever since!
24714,Fun little farming game. A bunch of hidden things you may or may not find on your own. There's some simple combat when going into the mines. Overall just a good game the will suck you in with all the things you can do.
24715,"A great game, a surprisingly deep rooted and interesting lore, easy to understand mechanics. I love this game, with a few staple Mods this has easily become one of my go to favourite games"
24716,i am addicted. help.
24717,Love this game
24718,"I see what people like about this game but to me its just analysis paralysis simulator. The game gives you so many different tasks that all have strict time limits due to the day night cycle / seasons mechanics and it feels like a mad rush to get it all done and use your time as efficiently as possible. Maybe I could stomach this game if it was like Animal Crossing and the time was tied to real life, but as it is it's just stressful to me, not relaxing.

Also I'm bisexual and don't like any of the bachelors / bachelorettes, how is that possible."
24719,YES

24730,"Stardew Valley has everything I could ever want in a relaxing, sandbox game. It perfectly captures the peaceful, calming atmosphere surrounding the area with a delightfully charming cast who fill the stunning backdrop. You will spend hours completely lost in the world forgetting your sorrows, purely focused on how you can make the people of the village happy, why does no one want this cave carrot (more for me?)! Who knew planting, harvesting and of course, who could forget, fishing would be so fun; not only fun but genuinely rewarding and purpose serving. The game is a must play for anyone looking to relax in the gentle breeze of this stunning artistic masterpiece. I cannot recommend this game enough!"
24731,The best game you'll ever buy.
24732,"Игра для тех кому нравится каждый день поливать по 10+ часов огород, осознавая что за день вы ничего не сделали, а потом когда дождались дождя, не знаете что делать, ведь огород не надо поливать.
Могу дать советы по тому что делать:
1- Постройте курятник. ~ Заведите курочку по имени ""Анатолий"".
2- Идите гриндить шахты до 23:00, а потом летите домой. 
3- Ловите рыбу, ночью вам может выпасть розовое ди*до, под названием ""чудо-огурец"", лучше сохраните его. ведь какой-то девушке он может понадобиться, и они будут этому рады. 
4- Полейте огород, не спрашивайте зачем. Просто полейте огород пока идёт дождь.
5- Очистите свою территорию.
7- Купите новых семян (молитесь чтобы была не среда, ведь Пьерр тогда не работает).
8- Позовите друга поиграть с собой, но учтите что если у вас будет ошибка, вам двоим придётся перезагружать комп, ведь ошибка не фиксится так просто.
9- Идите дарите подарки энписишникам.
10- копайтесь в мусорках (Осуждается энписишниками, не рекомендуется делать на их глазах).
11- Идти собирать ресурсы для клуба.
12- Идти делать задания.
13. Идти на ивенты, которые заберут у вас время, и отпустят вас поздно домой, что многие навряд-ли успеют полить огород.
14- Скипайте кат-сцены торговцев, или персонажей которые вам нужны срочно(как минимум если играете по сети, не знаю что в одиночной), ведь персонаж может уже уйти пока кат-сцена идёт, и вы не продадите свою тыковку ему. Кат-сцены просто потом глядите на ютубе. 
15- Хз что написать, удачи, и следите за временем, ведь воришки всякие воруют у вас деньги (10% с общей суммы(максимум 1.000)).
16- Чем позднее вы ложитесь, тем меньше энергии восстановите."

u cant disagree with me, this game can literally change ur mood instantly and i love it.

it isnt that expensive either :/"
24747,"Stardew Valley seemed like a game I wouldn't like at first: Busywork on a daily basis with all not only being on a timer daily but also seasonally. If you wanna be a in secure situation to keep progressing, you gotta keep buying and growing crops or earn money otherwise. Then take care of those crops, Clear your farm for space, water crops, later on you have to check on your animals and on top of all that you have a relationship mechanic with every villager in town, some of which you can even marry and have kids with. And I'm not gonna lie, it seemed simultaneously too slow and overwhelming at first.
This, however, was only a cursory glance. Once you have a foothold in the game or know roughly what you wanna do each season, the game becomes that much more enjoyable. You grow and ship or donate specific crops to complete certain goals or quests. You start building specific buildings for specific purposes. Outfitting them to automate processes so you spend less time and energy each day. You even unlock a whole new area with its own quests, called Ginger Island. This makes it easy to sink over a hundred hours into a save and play the year over and over again, putting new priorities into each season, without it feeling the same.
I'm told there's a whole aesthethic element to it, too. And I can certainly see how you can acquire certain decorative items and place them almost all over town. That part isn't so much for me, but you could easily be lost in it.
I recommend trying this if you wanna deccelerate even if it doesn't feel like a game you'd enjoy. I also recommend playing at least a year by yourself before felving into a multiplayer experience (which is supported aswell)."
24748,"If your game has problem starting, go to forums, follow gazillion steps and enjoy your game. [spoiler] No, thanks [/spoiler]"
24749,"Haven't played it for years. Multiple playthroughs. If you like harvest moon, then this'll be ur new fav game. Nice with friends, restarted it alot cuz of friends, only ever finished solo tho. Going to start again cuz of new updates. can be super relaxing or super min/max to get shit done fast, if you enjoyed any harvest moon game, try this, you wont regret it!"

My most recent bout of multiplayer was interrupted at least six times. Aside from that little detail, Stardew Vally is a great game to play whether it be solo or with friends."

You can do that. Chill, mine, and fight monster all day? Done. Love fishing or making food recipes? Done again. You wanna be a hot super farmer who gets the hot singles around town? You can frickin do that. All with a pretty cool soundtrack and engaging characters. This game is absolutely awesome. Play this game if you wanna have a fun time. It's Stardew Valley.

I wanted something new and relaxing, which lead me to Stardew Valley. Stardew became the go to game for a relaxing farming time and multiplayer made it ten times better for me as I could play with friends and my boyfriend.  There are multiple play styles which suit different people, and having people who love doing different things creates such a nice balance. This is a game totally worth the 15 dollars, but if you want to wait for a sale then go for it!"

24843,This is honestly one of my favorite games. It is such a chill game and it helps me wind down after a stressful day. I play it on my Switch as well and I've easily got 300+ hours on there as well.
24844,i have played stardew valley on switch and when i got my laptop and it just clicked that i can get a lot of my fav games on here. this game has to be one of the best sims i have ever played and would recommend this game to anyone. i love the animals the crops just everything in this game. <333
24845,"For someone who hasn't played harvest moon but played this game and not a fan of farming, I love this game! It's a calming game I like to play when I'm stressed out from stuff and just wanna relax, if my friends played it I would play it endlessly, but none of my friends irl play those games and the small group I have handly play it nowadays, but I still love it"
24846,"This is one of the best games I've ever played, so much life, character and calm thoughfulness. However, the mods do definitely make it better."
24847,"cuteness :3
"
24848,This game is surprisingly complex and confusing for something that looks seemingly so simple and relaxing :---D
24849,"An overall amazing and complete game - a friend offered it to me, and I originally thought that it was definitely not my type of game. I decided to try it out for them and out of curiosity, and oh boy i do not regret it.
I'm a pretty chill player, and spent my first 70hrs or so in the game just discovering all of its possibilities, enjoying the music and universe, getting to know all the NPCs, taking care of my farm and everything, and i did not see them go by. There is a lot to discover in there, and the community is super helpful and wholesome. The music is perfect, even the wood chopping sounds are relaxing its incredible!
You will definitely find something you like in Stardew, no matter what's your usual gameplay style. I mostly play MOBA and rogue lites, but there is this little special place for Stardew in my heart that the developer managed to carve. You can play to finally chill, you can go for a perfection run, you can play to explore the mines and fight monsters, you can play to date NPCs, you can play for the fishing mini game, you can play for the aesthetics and the joy of decorating your farm, you can play to screw Joja, you can play to screw Pierre, you can play for the money and start a wine empire, but once you get this game, I guarantee you you'll play.
If comfort was a game, it definitely would be this one - playing Stardew feels like staying home in a cozy blanket on a rainy day, and I highly recommend the experience."
24850,"Very relaxing, nice for people with anxiety"
24851,"amazing truly amazing
"
24852,"This game is Life. So addicting, and very wholesome :) It is also quite relaxing, and just overall an AMAZING game. Highly Recommend! It has so much depth to it, esp considering it was made by a single person, and was basically his passion project. I'm so glad I came across this game, because after a long and potentially stressful day, this game is perfect for getting rid of all that and an awesome way to unwind. I can't seem to be able to tear myself away for hours once i sit down and start playing. And that is a GOOD thing! You've got farming crops, raising animals, making artisan goods like mayo and cheese, pale ale, beer, etc. You've got a relationship/friendship building system, fishing, mining, combat, exploration, and so much more! Your seriously doing yourself a major disservice by sleeping on this game!
Also: The artisan perk at farming level 10 is freaking CRACKED XD"
24853,This game is so therapeutic.
24854,:D
24855,"guys, the game is overall extremely fun, very addicting , however i have an undderlying issue that needs to be fixed immediately, the serpents in game that is known to fly about non stop at the speed of a japanese bullet train car will not stop harassing me everytime i enter the stupid mines in the skull carvern, the damage it does brings foremost anxiety to its players, sadness and mostn important grief that destroys relationships where played with one another, the serpent is not beneficail in game and no matter how hard you griond, the end result is always the same, it is not fair to give your players such a overwhelming stressful experience when you false advertise your ""calming"" game just to fuck not only their minds mentally,but also destroy relatuonships between ute little lovers that were once so happy, but because of this disgusting little foul beyond hellish creature, i hereby demand you on your knees to delete this disgusting little shit, i hate it, rach1ael hates it, we all hate it, everyone in the community2 expresses a great amount of hatred against this fucking overpowered flying walmart minecraft bat, you stupid little shit, get a grip on your game you fools, make the game better, dont false advertise a calm loving experience for famly and friends, just for you to create such a scary gloomy atmosphere and not only break relationships but destroy all the BOND they had between them, you had one choice to make, and you decide to style such an elegant looking creature with beyond disgusting abiolities, damage it does to your playerbase, you make everything so easy in the early game, just to put the most disgvusting thing when your players get hooked on your manipulative game, you sick monsters, you do not care for the community seeing what you do to them, you make the game see so lovely first sight, making the exeprience so ""lalalal touch and go"" and then you decide to unelash all hell and havo1c amongst your players, truly such a disgusting action to see by such talented creators and developers, you concernedape, you are a terrible man that should not cease to exist, your name speaks for itself, you are a fuckin g concerned ape, you stupid little dumb monmkey, you are so concerning with the actions you do in game that you make people around you that you know concerned, get good mr concerned monkey, develop your shit game better, get rid of that disgusting little shit that wont stop terrorising people the moment t2hey fall in love with such a game which they thought would bring them such a lovely experience,,k you fukcing little manipulative of a dumbfuck, you need to learn to care for2 your playerbase more, doing this will n ot benefit you in any way you stupid little fuck, get a grip on yourself, you terroise people in utmost most disgusting ways worse than serial killers back in the 1980s, you little fucker, you need to get rid of thazt thing by all means, by your dearest most fiantic player and lover of stardew valley, shannon letson

24899,A gorgeous game that I've loved for about 4 years now. A nice pastime for if you want to feel productive without actually doing anything!
24900,"So far I've been quite enjoying this game. It does get a bit grindy at times, and almost a bit overwhelming with all the things that you can do in it, but it's good.

Runs excellent on Linux"
24901,Awesome
24902,buy
24903,fUN
24904,"Very very good game with lots to do. There's no ingame day where you won't have anything that needs to be done. Be it watering the fields, clearing the farm of wood and rocks, slaying monsters in the mine, befriending the villagers...

If you're looking for a cute farming game that's fun in both single and multiplayer, this is perfect for you!"
24905,i love this game too much
24906,Literally the best.

24921,god where do i start this game is PERFECT. the NPC's have actual personalities and you learn to love them (or hate them lol). the farming aspect is just the intro but there are soooo many more things to do its almost endless. highly recommend this game to everyone!!!
24922,Stardew is a genuinely pleasant game where you can customize a peaceful little farm and retreat from the stresses of life by... replacing them with the stresses of digital farm life. Definitely worth it.
24923,"there's nothing i can really say that hasn't been already said by others. its stardew valley... harvest moon never quite hit it for me, but the changes to the formula in stardew made my brain latch on beautifully. the music, the characters, the flow of the game, everything."

24933,This is one of my favorite depression games. It helps me focus in hard times and is very engaging. Despite playing it repeatedly there's always a new experience.
24934,I LOVE this game. 10/10 highly recommend
24935,"The music and vibe of this game are awesome. It's relaxing if you're not doing 10 quests at once (oops). overall SV has just the right amount of story and just gameplay, very cool 12/10."
24936,It's alot of fun. Super cute game.
24937,"OVER HYPED. uglyy art. THIS GAME HAS A 'BED TIME' for hells shake. YOURE NOT MY DAD.. dont waste your time. WAYYYY OVER HYPED by casual gamers. i love chill games but this game TRIES TO BE CHILL BUT is so  anal aboout everything. STORY IS STUPID AND BORNNG.  objectives are vague- crams in WEIRD ROMANCE OPTIONS WITH THE TOWN's criminals and INBREDS. gross. game for people with no friends who took the short bus. Everytime i open this game i just tthink of how much more fun it would be to boot up DTS and play that instead, so.....dont buy it. 

AGAIN THE game has a fucking BED TIME that forces your to drop where ever you are on the map and lose your items if youre not IN BED BY 2 AM.  im an adult and i bought this game for real money and ive never been so insulted."
24938,This game is amazing. The stories the graphics everything is fantastic. Could not recommend more highly

(Marry Abigail)"
24954,Simple one of the best indie games offering tons of content and fun.
24955,Cute
24956,"After 20 hours in SV I can really say is a masterpiece of a game. My only regret is that I just found out about this game in 2022. I hear I still got a long journey ahead of me which makes me excited as I dont want it to end. Romance options, farm simulator, and also your dungeon crawler all of these make the game stand out on its own. The creator of this game is making a new one and I cant wait to make my journey in the game as well."
24957,"My bestie made me want to buy this game and he constantly harasses me to play stardew with him. This is ALL he plays. every. single. day. He never answers me, he never messages me back until days later, and all he plays is stardew valley. You turned him into a farming sim twink and I can never get him back. *ugly cries*"
24958,"Stardew Valley is an amazing game where you talk and interact with NPCs or friends.You can also fish, mine, fight and farm.A main objective of most players is to fix up the broken up community centre.Tons of people love it and you can also get a girlfriend/boyfriend and husband/wife and babies.Festivals...Festivals are another part of the game.There are the Egg Festival, Flower Dance, Luau, The Night Of The Moonlight Jellies, The Stardew Valley Fair, Spirit's Eve, Festival Of Ice, Night Market and The Feast Of The Winter Star.You also get quests.And for those people who want to be bad there is a bad route.The Joja Mart.Along with all these good and bad stuff and drama.You can get a free pet and a not so free Chicken, Duck, Rabbit, Dinosaur, Cow, Goat, Sheep, Pig, Ostrich and Horse.Everything is so fun and amazing.Well that about wraps it up. 

10/10 good game.
1/10 only one creator so overall               11/10
My favourite game ever       and for how good of a game it is it is quite cheap."
24959,story line is incredible there is so much to do
24960,"I never thought I would like this type of game but there's something so chill and laid back, I've been playing non stop for hours when I should be working! Play this game your way and go in completely blind, only referring to the Wiki if you get really stuck.

I've enjoyed it so much, I'm even buying it on my Switch so I can play on the go!"

I'm going through exams right now and this has been a surprisingly relaxing game if i ever need a break. I can actually focus on the game and now I spend all my time on it.

If you're a fan of minecraft, terraria, or animal crossing, this is a great game for you.

25022,"It makes me feel good. I like how this sets me into a completely different realm of possibilities. Even if school is in the way, i somehow always have the urge to take a break and play stardew after every quarter of the semester."
25023,"It's great. The visuals are pleasing and the music is so calming. It can seem grindy at first but you get lost in it's gameplay quickly. Overall, if you are looking for a new game be sure to consider this one!"

25060,"I love this game! I could play it all night if I never had to sleep. I was lost when I first started the game, but eventually after searching on YouTube and challenging myself in different ways I finally reached the end game. The game is a go at your own pace game so you don't have to rush through the game at all if you don't want to. There is no right or wrong way to play the game. How fast or slow you play depends on you! I definitely recommend. Although I think it would be more fun to play with friends in multiplayer."

I did pay a lot for it, but it doesn't matter because it was SO worth it. Even with the effort it takes to get a relationship, it pays well. Especially Penny! (shes my favorite if you didnt notice) anyway stardew valley is an amazing game and if your looking to buy it, buy it on your laptop or pc so you can play with others. If you download it on steam it just is lonely sometimes, but yeah! BUY IT. ;D"
25099,like
25100,Okay The Game Is Not That Bad As I Thought It Was Just Boring At First But The More And More I Play The More Fun Things Get Maybe This Game Was Worth Buying In The First Place Just Remember This When You Jump Into Stardew Valley This Is Not A Modern Farming Game It Is A Rep Of Something Like Facebook Farms It Fun But Can Be The Death Of You
25101,Not recommended for those who are prone to addiction
25102,"very relaxing and a lot of fun

prefer it solo , but also fun in coop"
25103,"Stardew Valley is a really fun, calm game. It has a cool story line through-out the entire game. Every character has a different story line and background."

25115,"this is the second platform I've played this game on its that good!
after playing it on my bros play-station i finally decided to get it for myself of pc and it is still yet to disappoint.
I like the pc controls probably slightly better than the gamepad if I'm honest, though right and left clicking can sometimes be a bit finicky.
super awesome game with loads of play potential 41 hours already and I'm only on my 2nd summer first run through defintly worth it"
25116,Very chill and relaxing game! Fun to play with friends or by yourself.

I promise you there is so much to do and to explore, the characters you interact with are so dynamic and the quests are challenging in a good way. It feels so calm farming as well as interacting with the villagers and fishing. The mining can be a bit stressful but that is only when you first start you really do get a hang of it. IT IS SO FUN I LOVE IT!"

If you answered yes to any of those questions i have some good news for you , this game ticks those boxes and then some .Who needs to grow real plants or take care of real animals, that requires work and who wants to do that? Jump on amazon buy yourself some overalls and get ready, once you play this game you are qualified to run a real life farm."

If you want a game that can just be chill, buy it. You won't regret it. Enjoy one of the enduring masterpieces of video games."

25167,its a great and calming game to play with your friends
25168,"Was suggested by a friend.  I  knew it was a farming simulator going in, but I didn't expect to like it as much as a do.  Very calming and chill.  I'm enjoying it so far."

25177,"Beautiful game with so much to do.

As an avid Harvest Moon player back in the day, this game fills a perfect void in my heart. With an almost fully customisable farm and character, plus the choice to marry regardless of preference; it ticks the few boxes that HM has missed"
25178,"Farmer farm.
Farmer get money.
Farmer buy seeds.
Farmer happy :)."
25179,"Very fun, but don't be afraid to open a wiki."
25180,It is addictive. Don't say I didn't warn you.
25181,Love this game. It is accessible to all ages and isn't physically challenging to play. It showcases all sorts of people living together in a happy little coastal town. You can play for hours straight or for 20~ minutes at a time. No major story so far so id imagine you can just keep living on the farm? No doubt a very relaxing game. The music and visuals are done really well and help put you right there in the town. If heaven is a place I hope its like Stardew valley :)
25182,very fun :)
25183,oogga buugaa turnips go brrrrrrrrrrr
25184,"So far I have bought this game on every console going, so it just made sense to buy it again now i'm exploring PC gaming. I also loved the idea of trying out some mods to live out that dream cottagecore farm life~ Safe to say i'm not disappointed!"

25192,"There is SO much to do in this game, and I love it! I've played for 72 hours so far and still feel like I have so much left to do. I don't see myself getting bored any time soon, either."
25193,"i love it so so much
"
25194,pretty cool
25195,"I grew up playing Harvest Moon- and had been dying for a new Harvest Moon. Stardew Valley scratched that itch for me in the best of ways. This game has brought me (including my play time on the Switch) well over 1,000 hours of entertainment. With the addition of multiplayer, my boyfriend and I have made it a frequest routine for us to work on our farm together. With the multiple play style options- he can do the dungeon delving, fishing that he loves- and I can do the crop management and farm design that I enjoy the most.This game resonated deep within my psyche and awoke ancestral memories from uncountable past generations of farmers time immemorial.

The feeling was so strong that I completely altered my life plans, bought a small farm in the middle of diddle-do nowhere, and am more or less living the game irl. However I am so busy learning how to farm that I don't have time to play Stardew Valley anymore.

Thank you ConcernedApe, your little pixel game literally changed my life and now I won't starve while Western civilization collapses."
25196,It's a good all-rounder and it gives more than what one would expect :3

25224,"Fantastic game! This is the perfect game to play when you are looking for a very chill experience, it also provides great fun in the aspects of animals, mining, fishing, and etc. I have spent many hours on this game where I sit and think I have only played for 30 minutes meanwhile a whole 2 hours has gone by.

25246,There is much gameplay
25247,"Although I have only played for 38 hours at the time of this review I can say this is the best game I have ever played. Whenever I play this I am always calmed by the farmwork (harvesting crops,feeding animals) exploring the environment (Pelican town, the beach and especialy the cindersnap forest) the foraging, townfolk oh and the music! I love the music it is so fit for the mood of the game and so calming (I am in fact listening to the full soundtrack at the time of this review) then there is all the work that has gone in to this game. It can be seen after about a season (game days) playing with all the NPC's, the game artwork (witch is also very calming) all the progress, story, items, pets, events, the food, the different seasons, how the feeling of acomplishment when finishing something feels real (or just very good) after achieving something and the work gone into the happy vibe of the game. And not forgetting how the developers actualy made this game not for the money but for the expirience the gameplay. In total Stardew Valley is the best game I have ever played with amazing art, gameplay story, realaxing vibe and heart. 10 out of 10   Five stars out of five."

25251,"Easily the game that anyone who grew up playing Harvest Moon has been waiting for.  
Endlessly playable, endlessly enjoyable.  
Stardew Valley is the happy place my mind goes when my real life of not growing vegetables or not sneaking into the local farm lady's house to stealthily recover a pair of purple underpants gets too much.

25296,"Old review:
great game with fun activities and has large replayability

New Review:
I wanted to add this to really give insight into how much more I enjoy this game now. At first It was a fun standard game. I was not really into the whole aspect of farming games. But the more I played stardew especially with a friend changed my entire mindset on this game. I started to take it more seriously and looked into the story telling aspects. I started to dig deeper into understanding the story, lore and characters. I read more about to understand the fundamentals of the game. Ultimately this is something that I would highly recommend to someone even if you may think this is not the game for you. I would suggest getting it with someone to play with (especially someone who has played it before you) for your first time. Then after you understand the basics you can branch out and play the basegame by yourself or go for some great expansive mods."
25297,It's fine.
25298,best game ever methinks
25299,give this man some RESPECT he made the game alone which is mindblowing because i never thought this game was made by one single person so RESPECT.
25300,It is very  good it’s  even  better  with mods really  easy  to install  mods gud game
25301,"Why do we have hands?

Well there are many reasons:
1. pat Abigail 
2. hold Abigail 
3. cherish Abigail
4. forfeit all mortal possessions to Abigail

25302,"please i want to know peace. all i know is be bisexual, eat hot chip, lie, and date doctor."
25303,Best game ever!
25304,escaped
25305,"One of the most beautiful, laid back and simple games you could ask for. 

You don't have to do the story until you're ready to and the story grows and differs depending on how you interact with the villagers, you can farm, forage, mine and fish to your hearts content and since an update some time ago, you can even play multiplayer with your friends to get in on the action."
25306,cool game
25307,"There will come a day when you feel crushed by the burden of modern life...
...and your bright spirit will fade before a growing emptiness. 
When that happens, my friend, you'll be ready for this game."

25313,"This game is the best game on Earth. I can't stop from playing it for 12 hours straight. The NPC's make the game even more enjoyable (especially Sebastian). I love the music and the calm atmosphere it presents. This is a definite stress reliever, except when you're in the mines, but that's a whole different thing. 11/10 would recommend :))))"
25314,Fun indie game if you enjoy this type of game then you should purchase it.
25315,Really cool immersive game with lot's of different characters to interact with. It's a perfect balance of maintaining relationships and building up your farm.

25320,"This game is honestly so good for its price. The game in itself is lovely and makes you forget about your depression for while, no sad, just parsnips. The modding community adds a lot to the playtime too. 1000/10 will play 'til I drop dead. Thank you Concerned Ape."
25321,"very chill game, this was made by one guy initially. I still dont know how he managed it. I cant even finish drawing a since hentai piece because the lineart is painful and this man made one of my favourite chill game experiences over the course of like 7 years. mad props concerned ape"
25322,Best game I've ever played
25323,Very satisfying
25324,its pretty good i guess
25325,"If you haven't played it, you should"
25326,Its fun.
25327,PRETTY FARMING GAME GO BRRRRR
25328,The best game to escape from reality
25329,Amazing game
25330,"This game cost me around $20 and I feel like i scammed the developer based on how much I've gotten out of the game. I've bought and played games for $60 and up that I've gotten tired of way faster than Stardew Valley. Even if you aren't a fan of farming sims, still give this game a try, since it mixes farming with so many other things."
25331,I love this game so much! Each time I think I've done everything I find more and more things I've never even seen. This game is worth the money.
25332,"Once you launch the game for the first time, say goodbye to all of your free time."

25366,"this game has repeatedly gotten me to play it for hours and the make me avoid  it for days. i find myself deleting saves because of a mistake i let corrupt my view of it. this game is difficult to be great at. people describe it as a cozy game, relaxing and peaceful. but i find it cozy because i enjoy research and data sheets. i like having a wiki pulled up for stats on crops. not because i want to spoil the game, but because it makes it less overwhelming and gives me time to strategise my farming. thank you concerned ape for this phenomenon. i will continue playing and i will continue complaining."
25367,yes
25368,"a very fun farming simulator,  you can do many things. great fro just relaxing."
25369,HAley is hot
25370,pretty chill pretty addictive
25371,made me hard
25372,"Stardew Valley is a charming farming/life simulator with entertaining game-play, pleasant pixel graphics and amusing characters who have more personality than I've found in similar games like Harvest Moon or My Time At Portia. Definitely top of the pile."
25373,"its so good. You will cry if people don't like you in the game, it's that good."
25374,"This is a very good game. It is fun as the aspects of the game are farming, fishing, mining, foraging, making relationships, and restoring the community center. It is very fun."
25375,the junimos are small and round i love them 10/10
25376,"Great! Always worth it to play
"
25377,c'est vraiment epique
25378,"I really like this game its super addicting and satisfying, to me its basically better animal crossing (I've never played animal crossing don't care) The music is pretty good and yeah don't know what else to say other than its good and you should play it"

25387,"There is so much to do in this game. Not a lot of games have replayability, but you will never have the same experience from one playthrough to the next. The dev is fantastic at letting people do what they want in the game, and there is a ton of mod support. Definitely would recommend!"
25388,"Super fun farming sim! I love the ability to have multiple worlds on one account, makes it a lot easier to achieve many goals at the same time. I also like that I can play this game with my family! Co-op for the win"
25389,"Fun game, love the emo"
25390,good game
25391,"not only is this game adorable but really fun to play with friends and partners, its so easy to get the hang of and the music is very relaxing. I truly recommend this game and its definitely worth its price!"

25397,its so much fun ive been playing it for 3 years on my switch
25398,Its Stardew Valley mate
25399,"I love playing this game, both in singleplayer and multiplayer. Graphics are cute, it's easy to download and run, and I really enjoy playing."
25400,My main time sink. CA did a great job but adding some of the mods makes it into a whole new game!
25401,"If you have a partner, play this with them. It will work its way into your daily routine."
25402,"No shock to anyone these days that this game is fantastic, but I still want to give the devs a huge shout-out because they still deserve it!"
25403,"It was a saturday afternoon, and I was exhausted after an intense 17-part m**********n session to dream minecraft manhunt, when i suddenly had the urge to go outside. I was scared. It's been so long since i've left the warmth of my parents basement with my dream body pillows. I didnt know what to expect. Clutching my dream figurine in front of my chest, i pried open the door to the outside world. The gleaming sun blared through the door, bequeathing a brilliant warmth on my c*m-covered boxers. I quaverly took a step outside. My body flintched from the strange feel of the dirt under my feet. And then i saw it. The lustrous field of grass, covered in a light sprinkle of water from the noon rain shower. And then i realized. Dream... grass... the trees... it was all coming together. Grass is green, just like Dream. Dream is everpresent, in the grass, the flowers, He was there. I immediately new what to do next. I flinged off my clothes faster than the speed at which i would click on a new dream rule 34 post. My d**k was already throbbing as i leaped onto the field of grass, dorito dust stained shirt getting carried away by the wind. I dug a small hole in the ground, and passionately thrust my 7-inch erect c**k into it. I knew, this was Dream. His spirit was in this grass, and he felt my d**k in his man p***y as i f****d that grass. I lost track how long i was there. Hours went by, day turned to night, but it didnt matter. I was finally together, with Dream. Nothing could separate us. I took a long stem of a flower, and forced it in my a*****e. I imagined it being Dream's hot p***s being lustfully forced into me in bed. I stayed there on my front yard for god knows how long. Until my butt was sore, balls drier than the Saharan desert after a long drought. The lawn looked like there was a layer of fresh snow on a Christmas morning. Trudging indoors, i had a enormous smile stretching across my face. I couldn't wait until tomorrow, when i may go outside again and be with Dream.

-10/10"
25404,good game
25405,"Stardew Valley hasn't been something I've had for a long period of time, but when I say I recommend this game wholeheartedly, I mean it. I play this game in my free time, and if I'm feeling down it's something I can always rely on as a way of support, the graphics are super cute and the characters are all unique. If you're considering buying it (doitdoitdoit) you definitely should!"
25406,Sebastian
25407,Great game just don't put yourself through the pain of the prairie king unless you hate yourself
25408,"one of my favorite depression games; i own it on three platforms and every new playthrough is as relaxing and magical as the last. if you haven't tried stardew valley yet, please do. you won't regret it.

also sebastian is best boy."
25409,yes
25410,"good game 
i like the chickens"
25411,"Amazing game to just sit there and play for ages, and the fact you can play at your own pace just makes it so much better"
25412,"I like to meander and play very mellow. Slowly completely all the goals. I have a couple things left till perfection which have evaded me, 129 golden walnuts out of 130. Love repetitive menial tasks. Love the graphics super cute and pleasing to the mind and the music."
25413,terraria for pacifists
25414,"I love this game!!!!! Played it on the PS4 for several years, and now PC. Its a great game, lots of different options and ways to play. With PC, modding opens up a whole new world too."
25415,farm. also harvey is the best ngl
25416,"Good game, if bored i usually play this,"
25417,This game makes my heart happy :3
25418,cool game
25419,"Stardew Valley is a really relaxing game with cute goals and neat secrets. I will admit that I use the Wiki quite a bit, but that's how I have fun getting the most out of this game. I love the different things you can do, the goals, the options to decorate your house or your farm. I love the light magical aspects among the world and the community member npc's the most. My partner and I play together on occasion, and we both have our own, individual farms on top of that. The versatility is nice."
25420,It's addictive in the best way possible
25421,Goats are Poggers
25422,slay
25423,"a nice farming sim with a little bit of dungeon crawler and dating sim aspects. all around a great game

25446,"Don't listen to what people say about selling out to Jojo, I would highly recommend doing so. Great game to pass the time. You can put in as much or as little effort as you like"
25447,Great game
25448,good
25449,"The game is very nice. It does have some annoying things which could be improved gameplay wise, like the battle system in the caves, but otherwise it feels really cosy and it's nice and relaxing."
25450,it's a nice casual game
25451, v
25452,nothing needed to say.... its fantastic!
25453,"I put over a hundred hours into it on the switch and now I'm really enjoying the it on Mac and PC. I've been really happy with how seamless modding and cloud syncing have been. I was worried that running 36 mods and playing on two devices would be a problem, but it has been great."
25454,calm and good
25455,"I remember trying to play this game years ago and just not feeling it. Turns out, all I needed to do was watch some streamers to build up that base level of understanding, then rope my boyfriend into starting a farm with me."
25456,"U can cheat on the whole town, then blame it on the shopkeeper."
25457,Just play it
25458,Legit one of the best games ever made. This is the legal version of dope. Very wholesome. You can even install genocide mods and it will still be cute thanks to the graphics
25459,"Absolutely one of my favourite games, I always come back to it to play and build up my skills and farm.
It's great to play with friends or solo. Some elements can be challenging but you can essentially focus on whatever aspect of the game you enjoy the most, it doesn't force you to do anything.

I will say, it can be a tad grind based at times as you need to collect a lot of wood and stone but otherwise all round enjoyment."
25460,It's my best addiction so far.
25461,industrialized agriculture is fun
25462,cool
25463,epic
25464,I loved how fun and calm this game is! The neighbors could be a bit more respectful but i guess you do have to earn their trust. The different seasons are the best throughout this whole game! Thank you so much for the amazing creative fun adventures mindset!!
25465,ITS SO FUN
25466,"Stardew Valley is a beautiful escape from reality. It has romance, farming, mining, and combat. Its the full package. I have purchased this game for every device i have."

25477,Honestly a terrible game idk why people play it
25478,if i had to pick a game to play for the rest of my life it would be this one. 10/10
25479,gud
25480,good
25481,Nice Entertaining and relaxing game...
25482,This is a frictionless game. Hard to articulate. You can do the things you want to do. Explore what you want to explore. Build how you want. Achieve what you want. Without un-fun friction. Just perfect game design and character.
25483,This is my type of game. I like how I can decorate and manage my farm. The adventure and story is also engaging.
25484,i love my husband alex
25485,Perfect co-op game for a couple
25486,Nice Relaxing Farm Sim Game. For how simple the game is there is a lot to it. I like it so much I have it on X-Box and Playstation as well as PC.
25487,"Over all, this game made me feel immensely good inside. 
The graphics, and just the wonderful soft little music playing in the background. Oh my, it just has this.. Settle little cozy vibe in it, and just move at your own pace. 
This game doesn't make you feel competitive, or rushed; it's just a slow, work and enjoy game. I think that I've spent multiple hours during the summer on here, just because I was bored and something so satisfying about making thousands over night from selling vegetables. Like c'mon. Is that not even slightly satisfying to you? 

If you don't like all the working in it and the time you have to put into this game, then I'd advise you to still play; just install a cheat or something. Even though that isn't truly playing the game to the fullest experience. I do believe that literally anyone can enjoy this game. 
So long story short, just download something like SMAPI. After doing so you'll have the ability to add the mod through that and have your cheats. 
(Disclaimer, I do think this doesn't actually show you the beauty of the game, you can't actually understand everything like those who played it raw. Or in other words, using no cheats.) 

I think a few of my favorite parts where all the little hidden messages. Finding those was like a treasure hunt, because in some cases it was! 

Summary: 
10/10 Totally recommend for anyone who just needs something to hang out and play, the game has a feature where you can play with friends! I find that very fun. This game is flexible and just lets everything take it's toll on the player. Do yourself a favor and just play the dang game already!

25567,"Just simply addicting. ""What am I going to build next? Oh! Just one more day! I can upgrade my tools next. Oooh, now I can craft this next thing!"" And before you know it... hundreds of hours of your life gone and you're still hooked."
25568,it is relaxing and fun no matter if you lay for a hour or 8 hours
25569,"i'm having the time of my life on my silly little farm with my silly little animals. sebastian is the love of my life. this game is free therapy, 10/10."
25570,Stardew Valley is one of my favorite games to play and replay.  It has a wonderful variety of farms to try out and fun and a few vexing (still fun) quests to complete.  I would highly recommend this game to any one who enjoys farming games. ^_^

25577,"I really like the game, getting some materials early game is kinda annoying but it's manageable"
25578,What can I say? The mods grant it essentially infinite replayability. I can't see myself stopping playing it anytime soon.

It's so addicting, and I was surprised at depth and extent of the back stories of the NPC's.  Truly a great game, one for the books!"

25626,most relaxing game ever

25632,it is fun
25633,"This game is a amazing game but may have some down sides. This game is amazing I played it since it came out on the ps4 and then decided to get it on steam to do mods,  The only down side I ever face with this game is getting a little bit bored in late game but you can go grind the mines in the desert or skull cavern. You can spend hundreds of hours still not doing everything and you can play how you would like and I see it similar to Terria and Minecraft with being able to make what you want on your farm."
25634,"I love this game. It's simple on the outside, but once you step in, there's so much to explore. Game mechanics are challenging enough that it's incredibly rewarding when you accomplish a task or unlock new things and you won't feel too bad if you mess up. I've gone through a few save files but it never gets old. NPC dialogue can get repetitive in the beginning, but as you progress, their stories get deeper and some of it hits hard! Designing and building your farm and the community is incredibly challenging and rewarding. It's so addictive and you can see how much fans love it just by seeing all the content they share online, and it's all so positive (as far as I've seen). It's brilliantly fun and I can gush about it all day but I think the game speaks for itself! Stardew Valley is a great place to get lost in."

25638,This game is a treasure and as near perfect as can be! Cant wait to see the updates that come in the future.

25642,its cool i guess
25643,"amazing, I’m in love with Harvey. That’s all I have to say. Stay away from my man maru."
25644,"I cannot stress enough how much I adore this game. The story and creativity of each character is fantastic, and I love/love to hate all of them. However, it is nearly impossible without the wiki telling you what time or day and what time of year to do something or where exactly to dig or things like that. It gets a little repetitive occasionally, but the gratification of making progress makes it worth it. It’s a combination of animal crossing, Minecraft, and terraria. Definitely recommend it, as I’m on my 3rd year of the game and not even close to finishing it. The level of content is very impressive."
25645,"The game is great, very homey and very easy to sit down and play an in-game day or two per session or spend an entire day playing, going for ""just one more day"" for 7 hours.

I couldn't exactly call it relaxing per se, as days are very short and if you miss a fish, crop, etc then you've missed your opportunity to get it until the next year. So you'll be spending a lot of time hopped up on caffeine and crab cakes, sprinting around town just trying to get things done before you collapse at 2am. 

I'm not a big fan of how many requests from npcs involve a ton of luck to catch a specific fish or find a specific item, but you're (mostly) well compensated for your time. And the fact that you have to randomly stumble into a villager's affinity cutscenes to further your relationship means that you might have to look things up to avoid spending 3 years following them around at all hours of the day which is a bit on the annoying side. (Even just some hints would help.)

The game is an extremely slow burn similarly to animal crossing, but unlike animal crossing once you've completed your ultimate goal, you'll have 3 more dumped on you. The game is BURSTING at the seams with content, and has plenty of QOL that other games of the genre simply don't have like being able to check what you need to complete the community centre from your inventory or being able to see if you have any good gifts for a neighbour in your pockets from the relationship menu.

All in all, Stardew valley is the farming sim genre done probably the best it's ever been done, and for the price you get hundreds of hours of gameplay that you can come back to whenever to plant some crops do some mining, and seduce your crush with weeds and mayonaise.

25662,"This game is amazing, if you have the chance to play it do so. Trust me you wont regret it. NO SPOILERS - The game is set in a little town with their own NPC's and talking to them is always a new experience and never boring. There's 7 maps and they're all different and used for different play styles, and if you do get bored the community has made custom maps which expand the farm and other sites.
Listen just play it for yourself it's worth the £11/$11.

The updates over the years have brought a lot of new content that allows for hundreds of hours of play without getting bored. If you like cozy games that can either be really laid back or you really like pushing yourself to create the biggest and best farm, you can do both in this game. The last update brought more updates to decorate the inside of your farm buildings which made me super happy. The community is very welcoming and I've made a lot of friends who play stardew. 9/10 love this game"
25685,"A classic! The base game is engaging, and there's an incredible library of mods available for those who have played it many times before. You'll always enjoy coming back to Stardew Valley."

25700,"I have been playing Stardew Valley only for the past two months, but I have quickly become obsessed with it. The possibilities in this game are so vast. The game is so much more than just farming! Finding friends and love in the town, focusing on other skills than farming. If you want you can fish all the time, go into mines and defeat monsters, or build coops and barns and breed 100 chickens and have a mayonnaise monopoly.
I have had so much fun playing this game and I am nowhere near done with everything that the game has to offer!"

25713,"Really cozy game, I don't regret buying it. At first I took a break in playing after I finished the mines because I didn't know what to spend the days on. But after watching play throught it got me to want to play again. And it's fun again for me."
25714,"i love this game and i havent even scratched the surface of what i assume you could do in it. but despite me recommending it and loving it there are some flaws to the game

1) the energy system. im sorry but its too unforgiving at least at the beginning, it makes you feel like your character truly is someone who never did any physical activity in their life and yes i get it, she was working in an office before but theres no way she cuts some trees or whatever and is immediately depleted of all her energy. also its just not fun it limits you and what you can do in the game thats all it does, LIMITS YOU in a game thats advertised by soo many as relaxing and fun and peaceful its more anxiety enducing cause you have to think about energy depletion and how the heck to work around it. it gets better over time but its always gonna be there permanently annoying the heck out of you

2) time. the in game time is ridiculous it goes by wayyyyyy tooo quickly like i have never counted the time in the game but it feels like one day is only ten minutes or something how the heck am i suppose to get anything done at all no wonder the in game progress is so slow for me at least also if you dont get back to bed by 12 you lose money. like hello?????

3) the save system imsure for many players this is not as issue but for me it is. having a reallllyyyyy old school save system wherein you can only save progress when you get back to bed and sleep is realllllyyyyy annoying. first of i already have to manage energy depletion, manage time, manage where i am going, manage what i am doing, allll to fit so that i know i will be in bed by 12. JUST LIKE IN REAL LIFE??? this is a video game i wanna have fun not feel like i have to manage things so harshly i get it its a farming sim any sim game involves management one might aruge that without management and strategy sim games are nothing, but its just tiring and not fun

4) the npcs are incredibly boring unlikable and dont feel real at all. the dailouge for each character feels incredibly generic. oh look its an old man, hmm i wonder what personality he has? oh hes grumpy as heck of course, oh look a handsome guy i wonder if his convos will be filrtatious, ah yes they are, hmm little girls i wonder if they will all just be annoying and hate on my character for no reason. hmmmmm i wonder what else anyone in this town has to say about stardew valley aside from how hecking peaceful it is and how much they hecking LOVE living ""the simple life"" hmm,,,,,, the business manager for a big conglomerate gee i wonder if he will be typecast as the evil business person here to destroy this valley's purity oh yeah first cutscene of him is him giving out coupons and corrupting everyone. see what i mean? everyone feels like a caricuture.

ok thats it. despite all the ranting i still genuinely think this is an amazing game, albeit sometimes frustrating to get through."
25715,"I already played this game with game pass.
This game is literally on another level 10/10"

25719,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

25728,"Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911."
25729,"Extremely fun! I love the ""choose your own adventure"" aspect of it and with or without mods, it's a good time all around!"
25730,bom
25731,"Excellent game! There's always something to do with lots of content, great story and soundtrack, fun to play with friends!"
25732,"Amazing game to play solo or with friends. I almost keep coming back to it when I feel like relaxing...which is funny since I run a farm in real life so I do what I like even when I'm not ""working""."
25733,I love this game so much. This is amazing
25734,Literally everyone should play this 100/10
25735,Pretty fun
25736,#YASSSSSSSSSSSS
25737,Fun w friends
25738,Fun simple game you can play with friends if you enjoy farming and mini adventures while exploring the town!
25739,"One of my favorite games I have ever played, would recommend to anyone ESPECIALLY with a friend to do it with. Would also highly recommend mods (like the Expanded mod) once you get your toes wet. 10/10 will forever be a top favorite for my whole life. MASTERPIECE."
25740,"I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon, I break my arms. At night, I lie awake at night in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep. Stardew Valley, is the only thing, that I can enjoy in this torturous existence that brings me some small shred of joy, in the dark abyss of my unbearable day.

I was hit by a truck, and dragged 50 feet, yesterday, and died. In the hospital, before I died, I played Stardew Valley, and fortunately, was able to die with a small shred of happiness in the pathetic speck that is my existence in this vast uncaring cold universe."
25741,One of the most addictive games I have. This game is honestly just so good. The characters are very well thought out and memorable.
25742,i cannot put this down it has made my life spiral my children left me but its good otherwise would recommend
25743,just get the game
25744,"very relaxing game, but a lot of chores to do XD. Overall a cool game"
25745,"Perhaps the most relaxing and charming game I've played. At first I was not at all interested due to the graphics or the cute-nature, but I'm a sucker for world building. I love building and customizing my character's area in any game that offers it to me. From styling my farms, to determining what i'll specialize in growing/making to sell.. I just love it to bits. Oh, and Fish tanks that animate with any fishies I catch! I love my Squid tank and Eel tank so much. Oh and Sea Urchins with little hats on them that randomly move around the tank.. okay okay too much random here- let me refocus. This is such a simple and yet charming game that it being a labor of love really shows. I'd call this game a very Lite-experience for the few genres it occupies. 

Farming and Customizing your home/farm is the top attraction to the game. Where as if you want indepth control over how things look, you'll find Minecraft more appealing.. but if you want something to just settle down on, do a little busy work, watch cute plants grow.. and be able to do it on potato-y computers without a problem- then this game is really perfect. You'll have 4 seasons each with their own unique crops, grow fruit trees, grow coffee or tea saplings, make all kinds of foods out of everything you grow. You can even tend to basic farm animals like chicken, cows.. even rabbits and ducks! If you're really lucky, maybe even a lil dinosaur too! 

Combat is simple and to the point; slash the weapon when a monster is near. Move around to get out of attacks or attempt to block. Just slash slash til it dies. Plenty of healing items and food as well as buffs you can make for this later- some areas do actually get very hard later. But if you want hard-hitting combat or really smooth controls.. uhh no. Stardew is not that. 

Socializing with the many NPCs in the game grants you access to their homes or rooms, gives you gifts through your mail and even unlocks recipes you otherwise couldn't get. You'll get quests in the form of a questing board that is simple fetch or kill quests that improves your friendship with them. There is a bulletin board that opens up later that is intended for week or even monthly (ingame time) long quests which reward much more gold as well as unique recipes or equipment. You are not nagged to do these things and can approach them at any time you wish. There are also town events/season holiday events too where the towns people all gather and depending on that theme of the vent- you socialize, buy exclusive goodies for that event, play minigames.. just a lot of little things! Though eventually you may not really need to go to them anymore, and sometimes it is annoying that you may run out of seeds on a day an event happens and you cannot go to town cause 'we're preparing for the event!' which makes me a grumbley grumbler. 

Story wise there is a little theme and all the NPCs have their own personalities and stories.. from the tragic to the spoiled to the set-in-their-ways types. You can even take on a boyfriend/girlfriend and they'll come live with you at your farm and have their own little place.. sometimes they'll help out too! But eh... I wouldn't rely on this being useful in a mechanical sense, but for RPers out there you'll have a variety of people to choose from. I won't say its all ground breaking story telling, but it has heart and enough character that it isn't boring- its just normal. Normal everyday life, with a few odd exceptions here and there. I also want to point out that the game isn't too alienating either- you can have same-gender relationships too. Albeit there isn't anything that really is standout LGBTQ+ but it also wasn't limited out of your partner potentials either. Just putting that there for the curious ones out there. :)

There are a lot of challenges you can do, various different farm layouts you can try, a museum of items to collect, a handful of dungeon crawlers to do, lots of little unlockables... for such a tiny package the game really does offer a lot to do. I HIGHLY recommend the game for anyone who enjoys/needs a chill-out mode every now and then.. heck, Its even fine to play on the regular and just go nuts with farming! Much love and appreciation to ConcernedApe for just being an all around awesome dude with a genuine talent for charming games.

Favorite thing to farm? Blueberries, Cranberries and Coffee beans.. I love making ballpits of deliciousness! Its weirdly satisfying running through 100 blueberry bushes getting all the berries going WHEE! .. iz.. iz dis just me? Oh noes.. Also, Coffee.. ALL the coffee.. Must go fast!"

25752,This game is so adorable and my partner and I love having our own little farm together!! There's so much to do and it never gets boring!
25753,i LOVE THIS GAME BECAUSE IT IS VERY CUTE AND VERY ADDICTIVE
25754,bingus
25755,its awesome
25756,"Remember when games were made to be enjoyable and not suck you dry mentally and economically? Something you can bootup and relax on, knowing you will have fun the entire time. This developer does and that's what Stardew is, just pure fun and relaxation. Nothing about this game is frustrating or annoying, it just flatout fun through and through.

I know what many are thinking ""but that's a 2d indie game and I don't play those"". I encourage you to look at my most played games because you'll find that this has nothing in common with those, it is still the best game I've played in years. For the price the hours and plain enjoyment you can get out of it are unmatched.

If you have the steamDeck, this game is genuinely perfect for it. The controls are amazing if you want to play on keyboard or controller."
25757,This game single handedly destroyed my social life. 8/10
25758,"Game has been out for a while. i initially walked away from the game back in 2020 but came back after the 1.5 update. it added a lot to the game, and i have been playing it regularly ever since. 
One of the biggest things i like about the game is that there is no timeline to do anything. you play at your own pace. i am currently in year 8 in game and i according to Qi's list.. i am only 52% complete. 
only drawbacks on the game are that i feel the days are short and the seasonal events get annoying after so many in game years.. but i guess you can probably skip them after you've been to them enough times.. i just keep going to them for some reason...

but i do recommend this game and i am looking forward to his next venture.. the haunted chocolatier. :)"
25759,its fun :)
25760,Amazing game 10/10
25761,yes babe
25762,"Super cute, open world with few deadlines, character customization, fun little character interactions, just a really chill game"
25763,I like
25764,"yes
"
25765,"this game is the best one i've played since breath of the wild. to be fair, i don't play many games but i love how stardew valley makes me feel. i love it so much. play this game to feel happy."
25766,我爱种地
25767,"A very charming game were you can relax and and just farm or mine. I also find the villagers and their personalities very engaging and ,well, charming again."
25768,Heh. Gay
25769,"I underestimated this game & paid heavily for it LOL
I did not expect to play for 12+ hours straight & probably without blinking, almost everyday.
It is such a refreshing upgrade of the OG Harvest Moon & I will probably play this for the rest of my life 
There are so many mods that you have to be careful or you'll spend an entire day just modding
Even mods that add amazing extra story content to the game, new areas to explore and new characters so it has major replay value because it could be a different game every time you play it.
Imma always go with Harvey tho LOL
smart and sweet just wins me over every time.
"
25770,good
25771,game
25772,Very fun and relaxing. Fun to drop some shorts in a soup.
25773,Brilliant!
25774,a
25775,"Excellent game only reason I no play it on here anymore is I finally got it for another device. But this is cute with the ability for combat, exploration and love interests. All together a good wholesome game."
25776,"The premise of the game is simple, but the game play is actually pretty intricate. There's a lot more to the game than just farming. I also really enjoy playing this game co-op. Personally the travel time can get a little obnoxious for me, but other than that it's a good game that i'd recommend if you've ever dreamed of living in a small town."
25777,"Like Harvest Moon. Fun, simple farming"
25778,"1,041.4 h on  record. Including the times I forgot the laptop on at night, but still. One of the funnest, most addictive farm/life sim /RPG blended games out there."
25779,"fish fear me
women tolerate me"
25780,My wife eats rocks.
25781,"i have first played this game on my Nintendo Switch and wanted it on my laptop. This is my favourite game ever. In total the hours I have played this game on every platform is a little more than 400 hours. Totally worth it. If you decide to buy this game and play it, you won't be disappointed. Just know that you'll spend every minute of your free time playing Stardew Valley."
25782,Very swagolicious.
25783,"I played the Modded version of the game and yes so what I played with mods on my laptop then I remember to I want to play with mods on my laptop.
Yeah I love modded things on my laptop and other things and well I love to play with mods on games.
When I want to play with modded on Stardew Valley.
Great I really love to play with mods.




"
25784,"its so cute mwah mwah mwah <3
"
25785,"One of the best games I've ever played. This game, at first glance, seems like a simple farming simulator. But there was so much more to this game than you'd expect. I've never tweaked on a game as much as this one. Usually 1 or 2 hours in, I get exhausted after playing. Not with this one. I could play all night, and day. You'll never get tired of it, and even when you do, you'll find more reasons to keep playing. All in all, you gotta try it out."
25786,farm
25787,"i bought this game this game a month after it came out and i love it
it has brought me so many hours of calm into my life when i had none 
it gave me a safe place to escape from my life each time i needed it
and it continues to be a game i always go back to as evidence by my play time thats recorded here
ive also bought the game on xbox and have another couple hundred hours there
"
25788,"Fun, charming, soothing."
25789,really fun to play if you like a progress type game.
25790,"Lots of dynamic gameplay options, wonderful simple graphics, and a soundtrack that really immerses you into the small town farmer dynamic.

4/5, needs more water"
25791,Great calming game
25792,amazing. if you're on the fence about trying this game- just do it. you won't regret it.

You play too, will enjoy indeed."
25811,highly recommend... play it whenever you feel sad
25812,nice and calm
25813,"Amazing game, great for playing with other people, Especially if one person doesn't have a whole lot of skill, as this game doesn't need any. You got a partner? Would recommend playing with them, I'm on my 3rd one (That I have played this game with) now and it seems to be fun each time xD"

25815,Add sex

25822,"Women want me

25826,"Good game alone, great with friends, but you need to grind but that kinda makes sense. 9/10"
25827,Probably one of the most underated games ever. This game is soooo fun
25828,everything
25829,A+
25830,"I love this game but for some reason I go months without touching it, and then spending 20 hours a day for a day or two straight playing. Game feels very warm and fuzzy all around, though I honestly dont like some of the npcs, and especially dislike the fishing minigame lol"
25831,About eleven sir.
25832,Pretty chill to play with someone special or with friends
25833,e
25834,"fun for farming casual gamers
"
25835,yuh
25836,good.
25837,Perfect game
25838,very good
25839,"Wholesome farming simulator. But you get to talk to people in the town, build relationships, go to festivals, and build your home and farm. I didn't grow up with harvest moon so I can't tell you it's ""Just like harvest moon!"" but as someone who came into this genre with this being my first game, it's a very peaceful and enjoyable game. 

The only cons I could give this game is the fact it does get repetitive over time, but I haven't played new updates of the game so it may be better now. It's enjoyable when you've had a break but playing this often is... it starts to feel like a chore to water the plants daily and take care of the farm. Don't get me wrong- this game is great but it does get to be much so if you are into casual gaming and not long sessions, this would be your friend. Otherwise, you may be more like me who binges a few days and then won't touch it for months. 

Still is definitely an enjoyable game though. Is it worth the price? Yep. Do it."
25840,fun
25841,"This game is very relaxing. Yeah yeah I know, it kinda looks like terraria and Minecraft but man, when it comes to find a farming game, this is the one for you. As I said, its very relaxing and adictive. Even tho you dont know what to do, you will still enjoy it a lot. 
I highly recommend it, Its a very fun and relaxing game"
25842,I wish I can date jodi.
25843,this game the reason i didnt commit unalive
25844,"My playtime for Stardew is closer to two hundred hours, across multiple platforms. 

A lot of farming sims have slowly become more and more forgiving and easy, and Stardew is a nice break from it. It won't slam you into the ground if you mess up, but it stops the hand holding after spring which is lovely. The game itself has tons of content, and if you really want to do and see everything even past perfection it'll be a plenty long game. The characters are great and one of the best parts of this - I actually want to know more about them, and don't skip the heart events most of the time. The mechanics are slow at first, but speed up as soon as you get sprinklers and it can really be fully automated if you want. One of the best farming sims I've ever played, and it's still getting updated to this day. Absolutely worth the 15 dollars."
25845,great game
25846,"This game is perfect in legitimately every single way. If you are not with me, then you are my enemy."
25847,"Step 1. marry someone
Step 2. divorce them the next day
Step 3. repeat until everyone hates you"
25848,i luv it ya
25849,Great game! Fun to play solo or with a group.

25852,Fun and relaxing
25853,one of the best games ever i have almost 700 hours on Stardew valley it'll be a game i never stop playing stardew forever <3
25854,i like this game becyase yyou get to water the crops and pet the animals and milk the cow and yuhuhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmm make money and its kind of like real life a little bit i like it
25855,fun game
25856,"really good game, extremely addicting and very fun"
25857,"Love it, playing with friends is even better!"
25858,"I have played this hundreds of hours on my switch and of course I had to get it for my pc because of the additional updates and options. This is one of the greatest sims ever made, and definitely a labor of love by the developer. I love this game so much that I cannot wait for the next game by this dev. You will not be disappointed if you pick this up, and as a bonus it is always on sale!"
25859,"good game
"
25860,"I have spent 425 hours of my life on this game, and I own it on three platforms. SO WORTH IT."
25861,I like
25862,Vegetable 👍
25863,yeeee
25864,so fun!
25865,"awsome game
"
25866,"fun to play with friends, lots of cool stuff to do"
25867,I adore the diversity of this game. It's like a second life where you can just try again if you fail. Has kept me going for month and months.
25868,OMG YES! MORE! MORE!
25869,it good
25870,Very good game!
25871,"This is a wonderful game to relax after a long day with. Sat in my library for quite some time before I finally jumped into it, and it's a shame it took me so long!"
25872,This game has captured my heart. You can feel how much love and care as been put into it. I have put 100s of hours of a few different platforms.
25873,sleep farm sleep farm sleep mine farm sleep fish fish fish fish fish sleep farm mine kiss cat
25874,very fun game! great to play with friends :D
25875,its alright
25876,"Incredible fun and chill. I've played this on and off over a long while, and each time I pick it back up, I fall in love with it again. It has wonderful and diverse stories for each character, a really calming atmosphere, and great gameplay. The only semi-major downside is it can get mundane, and there's a few things you can do throughout the day. However, most of the time it's not a problem and plays well into the calm atmosphere!"
25877,ITS GOOD
25878,"its a coolboy game
"
25879,i cannot put how good this game is in words
25880,"This game resonated deep within my psyche and awoke ancestral memories from uncountable past generations of farmers time immemorial. 

The feeling was so strong that I completely altered my life plans, bought a small farm in the middle of diddle-do nowhere, and am more or less living the game irl. However I am so busy learning how to farm that I don't have time to play Stardew Valley anymore.

Thank you ConcernedApe, your little pixel game literally changed my life and now I won't starve while Western civilization collapses."
25881,"This game is amazingly wholesome with a lot to do that it was actually stressful from time to time especially when you are focusing on completing many tasks or objectives within time limits but the outcome was always worth it. I now have 100% the game(in terms of achievements but haven't gotten ""perfectionist"") and can finally take a break from the game. I have many good memories(and a few bad/bitter sweet ones) that directly connect with certain experiences in my life but I can now finally put this game to rest for awhile and move on with a smile on my face. Thank you so much ConcernedApe for making such a genuine game that many people should try out and I'm looking forward to your next project, Haunted Chocolatier!"
25882,good game
25883,lovely home
25884,This is a delightful game.
25885,You can lose track of time with this game.  Highly addictive!
25886,is good
25887,a
25888,"10/10
I just wish I could experience this game for the first time again :)"
25889,I own this game on many systems. It is good game.
25890,"It is a really good game, I am normally playing Valorant or Minecraft but I diffidently recommend this game! The graphics are great, lots of stuff to do and you can play with friends. 9/10 very well made."
25891,"I think the game did a great job at being the game that it the creator wanted it to be. Lots of fun and well worth the price. That being said I have created 2 save in the last 3 days and I have lost both of them due to the game crashing. Not sure if that's a problem on my end but it's very frustrating. If this  problem is ""exclusive"" to me I would definitely recommend to those who want an animal crossing/harvest moon style experience with its own unique quirks. Even if you aren't familiar with this style of gaming it's a great place to start."
25892,"it good
"
25893,I love it way too much. Just wanted to try something after terraria and it is pretty great
25894,Foda dms o game
25895,good game :)
25896,I am so normal about this game
25897,Its good
25898,RE-COM-MEN-DATION 👍
25899,"Need a cheat mode, I love playing casually but even more when I can cheat my way with some items, I'm pretty lazy and I know this game is sometimes made for you to put in work, but somedays I want to just go to Ginger Island but can't because I didn't get quality crops that season. Besides that, great game ! Love the characters, their stories, and everything overall.

Note: I tried modding but all tutorials are confusing for me,,"
25900,its worth believe me
25901,BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED thank you ConcernedApe
25902,"this is the best game i have ever played the story the quest and the farm part everything is fantastic it is also supper relaxing it is strange to think that this game is made by 1 person, first i had this game on mobile i bought it later on my laptop because i wanted to play multiplayer and use mods this game also has one of the most extensive modding communities thanks for this fantastic game ConcernedApe"
25903,"11/10 - I was addicted for a whole summer during college when it first came out. Since then, there's been a lot more updates with tons of content. Crazy fun and definitely worth replaying in 2022. Stardew Valley is IMO the best farming sim out there. 

[b] Follow my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41353964/] curator page [/url] for more reviews! [/b]"
25904,i love it
25905,"I have spent over 460 hours on this game...
"
25906,"Wonderful game, i like chick ckickens½"
25907,good game
25908,i'm not very good at it but it's honest work
25909,"Not for me.

A daily time and energy limit makes this game stressful to play and severely limits what you can do in a day. It's especially annoying when you want to explore the mines, as you can't go too far without running out of energy. When you run out of energy, you pass out, lose money (someone robs you) and then you wake up in your house the next day.

This limiting factor seeps into the entire gameplay where you will always nervously watch the time and energy meter, making sure that you're back in your house before it gets too late, and this ruins the freedom to explore and fun factor for me.

There's also a FOMO factor in that if you miss f.ex. an event or someone's birthday, you lost some potential progress and/or rewards.

The controls are a bit too clunky and inaccurate for my taste.

On the plus side, there's a lot of choice in the game, there are many varied activities, the pixel art is great and the music is allright.

If you're a completionist or perfectionist, I don't recommend this game. You have to pick and choose what activities to focus on, and you will always miss out on some things. Graveyard Keeper was a lot more fun and involved and had a clear goal.

Stardew Valley is a lot more open, with more activities but no clear goal."
25910,great game
25911,"I don't play many games like this, but ever since I have it has been almost impossible for me to try other games similar to this. I just play it on here with mods or on my Switch (mostly the Switch). Amazing depth and the amount of options for the player to choose from make this game very satisfying. You can choose to farm crops or brew beers and wine, or be a bee farmer and sell honey in massive quantities, or make fruit jellies and pickled vegetables, or go fishing, or mining, or mega harvest certain crops during certain seasons and do other things during the rest of the seasons. Truly excellent, and it is always getting little fixes and has multiplayer where you can build another home on the ranch for your friend(s), up to 3 other players can join you, making these farming and other options free to divide up the labor and maximize efficiency. Player choice is definitely this game's strongest feature and it is both relaxing and engaging. Definitely recommend for solo and or coop play."
25912,"Be gay, overthrow the local economy, throw eggs at the old and dying mayor, you got it all! 100% recommend."
25913,"Don't buy this game, you will never see sunlight again."
25914,very pog
25915,"A really relaxing game. Also, this game consumed my soul."
25916,iyes cik
25917,cows
25918,i hate usually hate 8-bit games but i love it. very cute and fun :)
25919,love it 11/10 perfect for harvest moon fans

25925,"me addicted, addiction good"
25926,romance and farming and random encounters. very nice.
25927,"idk what they put in this game but i cannot stop playing this game. its taken over my life. the upside is that im not longer addicted and dependent on genshin as my main hyperfixation but the downside is that all i do every day is fish in stardew valley, mine in stardew valley, romance sebastian in stardew valley. help me. help me be free. let me out of the cage"
25928,"I love this game. It may be one of the best games ever made, certainly in the past ten years. Has everything I could possibly want to make me happy."
25929,Very fun and exciting. Perfect for those who want to just relax
25930,<3
25931,"It's a fun game with so many things to do, and so many things you wouldn't expect to happen, but makes you want to 100% the game that much more"
25932,"Addictive and fun. If you have a significant other or someone who you like, then get them on Stardew and do the many dances with them."
25933,This game is great!!!!
25934,I just find this game so relaxing. I have it on multiple platforms and recomend it to everyone. its so much more than just farming and there is so many things to push for and achieve in the game.
25935,Its freggin fun!
25936,the whole marriage thing kinda ruined the whole thing for me lolol. But i enjoyed the mines and farming a ton
25937,There are soo many ways to play this game and i love it!
25938,COOL
25939,<me flirting with all of the marriageable npcs> im not gonna get anything done hoeing like this
25940,Awesome game. Love all the thought put into the game.
25941,11/10 the best
25942,"Perfectly crafted indie game with amazing music and such chill, relaxing vibes."
25943,the best game in the universe !!
25944,"Pretty fucking addicting, great game for the Steam Deck when I eventually get the mail... Eventually :("
25945,"Why did I buy this game, when did i bought it? 
             well whatever its pretty fun and I highly recommend it."
25946,got plenty to learn
25947,i like plants and making money
25948,"Despite what my hours may tell you, I assure you I played this game a lot more on the mobile port and only recently was able to get my hands on the PC version.

Stardew Valley is addicting as hell and its able to perfectly strike a balance between a relaxing farming and fishing sim and it's more stressful gameplay elements like Mining, fighting monsters and getting to bed on time(I swear the last one is not a joke).

Paired with Ape's iconic soundtrack and beautiful pixel art there's something for everyone to enjoy in this game. So even if you feel like you're not really the type to play this game, give it a chance."

25959,"the chickens don't die, don't panic :D"
25960,"I’m going to be honest with you, I’ve played this game 21 hours and I still don’t get what it’s about. Love playing w my friends and mining and trying to get Sebastian to fall in love with me."
25961,"Im used to playing shooters (Battlefield, Fortnite (ik cringe) and Roblox shooters) so this is such a great break from those. It is actually so chill. i very much recommend it."

25970,one of the best games ever if you just want to relax and play a casual game with a rich story line then this is the game for you me and my wife love this game and play it together all the time we have pretty much covered every inch of the story lines . have got to say that this is one of the best games we have played its so addicting. def grab it if you have the money dont worry about time because with this game you will loose track of it XD
25971,its my new fave game
25972,"The game itself is super calming, and while certain aspects can be tedious (such as fishing or fighting in the mines), the game itself is lovely. The characters are amazing, the events are fun, and the base game, farming, is enjoyable in ways I didn't expect. Overall, an amazing game, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun game to play when you're looking to unwind"

26004,I think my playtime is enough of a review to be honest.
26005,blueberry
26006,"around 2 years after buying this game, I think I have a good and honest review for it. I bought it contemplating if I really should as I don't enjoy games such as this where you farm and do quests and such. However when I bought it, I got hooked on the game. The music is a 5/5 and the atmosphere is amazing. It's a fun game to play whether you are streaming or just relaxing. Fun for all ages too! If you were to buy this game, know what you are getting yourself into. This game isn't a hop on for a few hours and you're done with the game type of thing, its a play for about 50 hours plus and you're done. However you can never really be done with a game like this. There are so many different ways to play and you cant choose just one! Whether you want to spawn in a lush forest, or the sandy shores of the beach. You are going to want to play this game so many times its hard to count. As you may have noticed, I've only played for 24 hours. However its not cause I don't find the game very enjoying, I just don't have as much time as I would want to play this. I give this game a solid 10/10 IMO. I'm sure you'll love it too."
26007,"This game has shown so much and I believe that more can be done to make it better but for me, I love the game and everything that they put in it. I have this game on Xbox, Switch, and PC. But i just started on computer a year or Two ago. I suggest this game to all players who love RPG and Farming games. Thank you."
26008,yes
26009,"It's the best form of escapism, I love this game so much"
26010,Addicting would not buy
26011,"farm very good, yeah"
26012,Chicken uwu
26013,"Honestly one of the best games of all time! The game play is your own pace so there is no real rush, the music is fantastic, I find myself listening to the tracks on soundcloud too much and the characters are so unique and each one feels different from the other. 12/10 would recommend this to anyone and everyone!"
26014,"This game is so fun to play. I love it so much, i would totally tell people to play this game."
26015,good
26016,"super fun game, similar to harvest moon except swords."
26017,Incredibly addicting game with endless replayability
26018,Farm.

26067,"An incredibly charming and beautiful game! It is a very relaxing farming simulation, that also includes mining and fishing as well exploration. It is masterfully designed to include hidden areas that you can find, or unlock through story progression or puzzle solving, the NPC's each have their own personalities and stories, some of which deal with incredibly sensitive and deep topics. The game is a lot more involved than I expected, which makes it replayable for hours. Overall amazing game <3"

26102,"This game has been a favorite that I've bought across almost every platform of mine.
A few days ago I decided to test this with the deck.
First and foremost I have loved this game on desktop, and it has always controlled well. Even when I paired an Xbox Controller. Once I booted it on the deck I was greeted with the same config as switch. It works and plays wonderfully on the deck which made me quite happy. 

Now about just the game and not just how well it has run for me:
If you're seeking a good simulator game that allows you to choose what you do freely, this is for you. You can not hone in specialty crafts, but you can choose to mine, farm, forage, fish, and more sorts of things. With so many secrets in the game and hidden story-lines, you can learn so much about all the characters around town."
26103,shane. i can fix him.
26104,best game ever
26105,enjoyable
26106,Its pretty calm and pog

26116,"Played around 400 hours on GOG and as of right now 18 hours on steam. Very fun but in my opinion better with friends. Highly recommended.

Also someone you can date eats rocks. 10/10 would date again."
26117,I LOVE STARDEW VALLEY!!!!!!!!!
26118,"An excellent farming sandbox game with a ton of content. Some minor aggravating issues.

Also, Linus tricked me into going into his tent where he proceeded to r@p3 me. Then I was tricked by a letter asking me to bring honey into the woods and was r@p3d by a bear. What a ride!"
26119,All around awesome game. 10/10 recommend.
26120,"Great game, sank way too many hours into it.

A few mods make it even better. You can use SMAPI (cross-platform, docs at https://smapi.io) to load lots of different mods, all of which can be found at https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley.

Here's a list of the mods I used, which I'm posting mostly for myself in case I want to revisit this game again some day (95% achievements, 500+ hours, was... enough).

26128,"This is definitely one of my favorite games I've ever played! I've played a lot of different farming type games and this is the best one.

26143,"If you're thinking about getting this game, DO IT! I got it on the switch a year ago and it's my favourite game ever. When I got my PC I knew I had to get it again for another farm and to add mods. The dev also deserves all my money really"
26144,add sex
26145,I love the co-op and the single player modes. Fighting monsters has been a lot of fun. It's pretty much harvest moon with a dash of Zelda. lol
26146,"~Pros~

+ Great looking pixel art, that evokes nostalgia

+ The soundtrack is nice

~Cons~

- You'd think this game would be relaxing, but no, it's actually very anxiety inducing, so stay away if you have trouble with anxiety. There's tons of stuff that you need to do, and time limits everywhere, and very little time in the day for you to do that stuff before the game knocks you out. The game is filled with lots of running back and forth to stores, water crops, fetch items, give gifts to NPCs.

- Related to the above, the short days, combined with the busy schedule, results in a lack of time to yourself, so exploring is de-incentivized.

- The gameplay is boring. I don't feel like I'm doing anything, accomplishing anything, or experiencing anything, It just feels like a bunch of pointless busy work and fetch quests.

- The combat is sh*t.

- The animation is very simplistic.

- The character portraits are kinda bad to be honest.

- Nearly all of the NPCs are unlikable.

- NPCs having their own schedule is realistic, but in practice is frustrating. Marnie and Pierre will stand there staring and dumb sh*t THE ENTIRE DAY, and not help you or sell you anything. And this can go on for weeks."
26147,Game good. Buy it.
26148,moo
26149,I was sick as hell and needed something to chill and this was the solution
26150,"Best game I have played in a longtime. If you are questioning buying it do it.

Its a beautiful game, and I definitely recommend people add it to their game collection"

26167,"Stardew Valley is a literal gem in the gaming industry. Everything in the world of Stardew valley is chill and relaxing. When playing Stardew Valley, one quickly grows found of all of the characters that bring life to the game. Ultimately, the ""farming"" side of the game becomes an excuse to interract with all of the characters. All in all, this game is awesome and time flows really quickly when playing it. Therefore, if you ever feel blue and sad, buy stardew valley and enjoy warm and cozy world where you'll be sheltered from everything that makes life tough."

26211,"All of my hours are specifically from multiplayer, however I'm sure the experience is the same in single player just longer. It is a game that is really amazing and has a great backstory with all of the characters. While my experience might be a little sped up compared to others, it was one of my favorite games and I will most definitely be cherishing the memories I have made while playing it."
26212,Played this through a few times on switch but now playing it through on pc with some friends and really having a blast. Loving it as a multiplayer game! Highly recommend playing this either solo or multiplayer if you feel like chilling.

26235,"This is a very cute game. If you have ever played Minecraft and like the aspects of that game, you'll like Stardew. It has some very wholesome dialogue between the player(s) and the towns people, as well as some really cool events in game. Overall Id give the game a 9/10 :3"
26236,stardew valley is kadens favorit  game
26237,dope game. even better with mods. 8/10 without mods 10/10 with mods
26238,nice !
26239,best game - alex is my baby
26240,Literallt best game ever
26241,"good game, great graphics, good good"
26242,Absolutely recommend to anyone interested. By far one of my favorite games. Endless replay value.
26243,"If you like farming, cute boys/girls, ROMANCE!, fighting monsters, and fishing, this game is for you! I personally love this game because: 
1. you can gain friendship with everyone and marry certain characters (giving gifts too!)
2.You can get cute animals and their products sell for a lot
3.For every certain amount of hearts you have you get cute cutscenes showing what their life is like. 
4.Once married your spouse will water your crops and feed your animals
5.You can have children, they only grow to toddlers though, but you can turn them into doves and get more!
I love this game, I would recommend you try it!"
26244,"Great way to kill some time. you boot it up and next thing you know, you played through the night and are about to miss work. 11/10"
26245,Farm

26251,"Well, I`ve tested this game a for a while, and, yea, its pretty good. Obviously I need a little more time so maybe I will edit this review after my next thousand hours?
Its escapism, plain and simple, its as min maxing or as relaxing as you choose to make it. Its such a beautiful little game that frankly I wouldve personally paid five times more than the price and would still think it a bargain"
26252,hi
26253,i wish you could brutally kill your friends in multiplayer
26254,"Excellent, really  excellent"
26255,good
26256,I dont like you
26257,Ive played this game before and everytime i make a new farm i get invested. Love this game
26258,This game is very relaxing and fun!
26259,very cool quite snazzy
26260,"I absolutely love this game, it is one of the best indie games I have played. I highly recommend it if you like indie games."
26261,yes
26262,"plant grow hit slime
 :) good game"
26263,farming is lovely.
26264,one of the best indie games of our generation
26265,"i really like the game, that all you need to to know"
26266,.
26267,its lit
26268,I Love It
26269,very very very gud recummend
26270,I love it so much <3333
26271,mayor lewis kinda sussy ngl
26272,Farm.
26273,ive actually been playing this game for over 2 years on other platforms and i absolutely love and adore this game so much i highly recommend this
26274,I like it :)
26275,"It's fun, because it has many secrets to the game, and it requires skill on some parts. It's really long, which makes it fun."
26276,Lovely pixel game.
26277,always something to do
26278,BEST. GAME. EVER.
26279,"Very Relaxing game, lots of content - though lots of it is hard to find and the wiki is 100% required for a newbie. Other than that its a great game."
26280,"Beware: This game is literal crack cocaine, please help"
26281,first game i brought. love it
26282,Great game
26283,it's fun but the audio always echoes after 10-15 mins of play through.. still playable in the compatible version so it isn't so bad.
26284,Best game ever
26285,Super cute
26286,.
26287,"Stardew is worth every penny and this is one of few games that is really for anyone. The only issue is that the updates to this game are once a century and the end game whilst being improved still needs a lot more to it for people to keep coming back. After a certain point, there is really no drive to keep playing, it needs more end game and post year 2/3 content. It becomes similar to a very long roguelike with farming mechanics after some time."
26288,Abigail and Penny supremacy
26289,"This game has made me lose touch with the outside world, 10/10. Plus Abigail is the best girl hands down."
26290,"Single-handedly my most played and purchased game ever. I have bought it on every platform that exists on besides Xbox. I love this game. I praise this game for the direction it took into making just a simple game that is complex if you want it to be or the most chilled out game you've ever played. The music helps add this air about the game too. Plus, it isn't just a farming simulator, it is more of a life simulator. As you play as the character you created, you can fish, farm, mine, fight, and forage as all main actions. Plus on top that, you get to recreate this whole town and make friends with tons of people. Being friends with people is also a whole system in itself, plus this can lead to you becoming married and maybe even getting kids on the farm. I recommend this game to everyone and at most ages too. I feel as if both ends of the spectrum can enjoy this game."
26291,so good
26292,Very chill....  very fun!
26293,"hello my name is potato man. i like growing potato in summer an selling them in joja mart
"
26294,"mm, very good."
26295,so bad with the multiplayer i can't join my friend game
26296,I really enjoy this game. It is fairly simple and very relaxing. Highly recommend for people who like Animal Crossing or life-sim games!
26297,"Very intertaining, challenging and fun. You can talk to other town members and attend events, every choice you make having an impact on the way a NPC sees you. 
Personally i would recommend this game as I've been playing for almost 10 hours now and im still not bored."
26298,"Super chill game, do recommend, charming visuals and very fun game play."
26299,is very nice :)
26300,Absolutely adorable and love the game. It's very relaxing and calming
26301,Is fun game.
26302,mto massa
26303,Great game if you're less than 15 years old.
26304,It is an amazing open world/free world game and i really love it and i also recommend anyone who sees this review to play the game for yourself!
26305,Yeah
26306,addicted!
26307,if u ever wannaa name ur chickens n words u can so ye this game aint bad
26308,"I play this game to relax.  There's a lot to do, and for a game that seems simple, it has a lot of layers.  Don't underestimate resource management, particularly time management- you have so much time in a day, so many days in a season, and so many seasons in the first two years."
26309,it good game very good dino buddy is there  - ugg reviews

26312,hands down the greatest farming game since harvest moon on the gamecube
26313,A MUST PLAY FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR A FARM SIM
26314,yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaassssssssssss slayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
26315,Love this game
26316,"A game by and for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

This is the game John Romero would have made if he wasn't a phony. This is Daikatana from the timeline where Reagan's mom swallowed. This is slime. This game found a porno mag at the park, and it's not showing it to you. If this game were a person, it would steal cable. Run like hell, kill like run.

Harkonnen

The garish, surreal, and grotesque all hyper-normalize at a certain point until it's just noise. All carried beautifully by a distortion-heavy noise rock chugging that matches with the steady waving rise and fall of the level geometry to form a hypnotic state. Most of the time, the 3-2-1 countdown of the run dying doesn't reach the 2. The momentary flashes of relief from the end of level screen start to feel less like peace and more like the hangover periods sitting at a bus terminal early in the morning. Bleary-eyed, aching, miserable. The last slice of meat in the package, awake at your own protest. Hit the button, spin it again. You know you want to.

Finally, a good video game."
26317,I have over 200 hours on my Mobile saves.  Would highly recommend.
26318,Play this game if you want to take a break from your other games. This is a very relaxing game where you set the pace.
26319,"This is the perfect blend of a farming/crafting game and a romance sim. Everything is thoughtfully and artfully made, the pace is calm and soothing and the mechanics don't feel cumbersome. One of my favorites."
26320,An absolute classic. Endless hours of fun for an amazing price.
26321,its really good games
26322,Its a classic.
26323,"AMAZING
so fun
"
26324,junimo = very epic
26325,"Never was into gaming for 20+ years of my life. Installed this game because I tried playing it for 10 mins on my friend's account, and was addicted ever since.

I love how calming and comforting this game makes me feel."
26326,Amazing
26327,It is the best game!!
26328,the game is very calming and helps me to relax when stressed.
26329,"Amazing game, relaxing and entertaining. Extra longevity."
26330,One of the most relaxing games by far!
26331,good
26332,fish
26333,great
26334,"This game is good for people who like to sink massive amounts of time into a game before stopping and not playing it again for months on end, on a repeating cycle. Like me."
26335,Epic
26336,This game is absolutely perfect for relaxing and playing with friends. It is a very easy game to get your significant other into as well.
26337,farm
26338,the best game ever i have played for 300 hours and is still playing
26339,Great chill game to play with a friend or partner
26340,KOOL FARM GAME!
26341,coiol gam very funkle
26342,yes
26343,"What a fantastic game! It's simple enough for new players to get the hang of, while keeping more advanced players entertained. There's always something to do. 
The day time progression and requirement for energy give the game a pleasant difficulty. Energy lows can be easily remedied by eating food. Time can be easily paused by bringing up your inventory when you need to walk away for a bit.
 The fishing and arcade games can be difficult to master, but well worth the time to learn. Fishing is a great way to make money in the early stages of the game.
The seasonal festivities give a charming feeling like you would expect in a small, rural community. They are also a great place to buy seasonal recipes, decor  and seeds. The festivities also offer an easy way to speak to everyone in town, even if some of the residents are a little cantankerous.
The charming pixel art is well thought out and amazingly detailed. Character customization is remarkably thorough without being overwhelming. 
For those who enjoy modding their games, there are thousands of mods out there. For those who prefer tutorials and walk throughs available all over the internet. 
This game really does have something for everyone!
My only regret with purchasing this game is that I didn't know about it sooner.
"
26344,"For this I was diagnosed as a [b] wasting disease [/b]. So, decaying in my bed of red and green fluids, I grew green and red vegetables on the farm of little troubles. Some days the lethargy bled into my simulation and I let my crops wither as the seasons marched on unsympathetic, never letting me catch up and make good. I hid from the folk of the town who shunned me, tho the children were even more cruel, flinging stones at my shack and teasing me with callously crafted insults like stinging whips of dehumanisation. I dreamed of better, slowly atrophying in my narrow hospital bed and knowing this game was making everything so much more worse. Yet, I play on. Exalted are the pains and pennant labours of starvation on the farm of little troubles. This which must be done every morning without fail, until sweet nothing usurps mortal suffering. I can no longer sustain the weight of my laptop on my legs without pain untold like a stinging nettle vice grip clenching my entire nervous system. Yet despairingly I can no longer lift my arms to play on the dolly tray. My Den Mother Donnah has power of attorney and refuses to let the doctor unplug the game, as she takes the screen captures of my near 24 hour game play and fakes her own lets plays using a computer generated Korean girl, called Hyun-Joo. One time my petrol uncle Richard snuck in and unplugged the game, which I then only pretended to play. I started to recover immediately, but of course Den Mother Donnah eventually came with a thirsty lust for new farm times. The consequences I suffered were swift and efficient. Like in times past, she engulfed me with her frumpus and denied my body sweet life preserving oxygen. All the while she gripped my hair and twisted while leaning back and pinching my stomach, her immense weight seizing my frail frame in place, as I feebly thrashed my legs suffocating in her frumpus musk. This went on until I lost consciousness. When I came to, the laptop was on my lap, with the little trouble farm game running and my aching arms all ready engaging the motions to play before I was even present in the waking world. There was no escaping my farm. Thank you game for giving my life a point.

10/10

26345,"Stardew is a fun farming simulator where you can create your own farm, find a romantic partner, fight monsters in caves, and more! Aditionally, you can co-op with your friends and create a shared farm for an even more fun experience! Although the game may feel a little bit slow at first, its hours of content and relaxing atmosphere will leave you wanting to play all day!!!"
26346,"A good game to chill out with. It has an intuitive and satisfying gameplay loop, a nice aesthetic, and clear, obtainable goals for most of its runtime, though as you approach the tail end of the content it starts to lose many of those qualities."
26347,"They told me I could play SDV however I wanted. They told me I could be whoever I wanted to be. But I'm a serial dater and enjoy getting to second base with as many guys and girls as I can at once, so I did that. Then the town shamed me. Final rating: 12/10"
26348,"Stardew is the best game ever. Have probably put more hours into this game than I have in any other video game (hundreds)! Just buy it and play it, it's worth way more than $15."
26349,The farm must grow.
26350,bruh this game kinda bad

26371,"im so addicted; ive lost my wife and my kids turned into doves, but all that matters is Stardew Valley"
26372,"gud edit: 100+ hours later, still gud"
26373,"I love this game, it's great for having fun with your significant other, and just overall building a farm is so peaceful and relaxing. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a chill game, that they optionally want to play with someone who means a lot to them."
26374,Its really easy to just get lost in the game. the details are nice and it brings me quite a bit of relaxation.
26375,"I have nothing new to add. It's a game that has resparked popular interest in and harvest-moon-esque farming simulators and countless clones. It's good, and the 1.5 update is a pretty nice improvement to quality of life and some additional content to keep you going.

Multiplayer is a pretty good time if you've got other interested partners. This is one of the few games I've able to convince a play group to join in on."
26376,funni game
26377,yes
26378,I love this GAME! It has a lot of Exciting content. I love going to the Desert and completing the community center. By repairing the ship you can go to fern island and I love going there. I think it is a fun game and I suggest you play it. After you complete the community center you can make the abandoned Jojo mart building into the movie theater. I love this game and hope you do to!!!
26379,linus
26380,"Honestly can disappear into this game for hours, having an amazing time."
26381,So cute
26382,Game is good
26383,"Stardew valley is a wonderful game that allows you to get away from the state of the world and take your time with a simple premise of making a living with everyday life in the quiet country side of Pelican Town. Whatever you desire to do is at your pace and at your leisure. Many, if not all, of the characters are endearing and it truly is a game you can relax, or go ham making as much money as possible."
26384,One of my favourite games! I am so glad I decided to try it! definitely recommend! : )
26385,good game
26386,<3
26387,i mf love this stupid lil game
26388,me likke farm rpgs
26389,It's just great and wholesome
26390,this game is so addicting !! im not normally someone who likes slower paced games but i absolutely adore this game. theres so many different options for what you can do and you can give yourself enough direction to keep it interesting if you're goal driven !!
26391,"I've had my eye on this game since it came out a couple years ago and I finally got around to buying it. I don't really remember what was stopping me before but whatever that doesn't matter anymore. What does matter is that this is a fantastic game, It's pretty easy to get the hang of and is very fun. As an added bonus because of the style of game it is if you are playing on macbook you""ll be happy to know that it doesn't make my laptop sound like it's getting ready for take off lmao. All in all so far a very solid game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes farming sims and or rpgs. 10/10"
26392,i water the crops
26393,"chơi bao nhiêu lần vẫn hay, vẫn cuốn"
26394,yes
26395,Col game
26396,Krobus is my only true love
26397,"A good, chill game. Makes my brain happy."
26398,yes
26399,"Its a good game, very. I havent played this game nearly enough to fully write a review, but I will try my best here. You can earn money buy selling crops, fish, ores and other objects. With money you can buy stuff, like more seeds to make more money. It has good music, plenty of characters and Krobus. There is also Dwarf. You cannot marry Dwarf, which is quite unfortunate. Modding this game makes a good game even better."
26400,great
26401,very mid
26402,a game that easy eats your day way before you know it  <3
26403,"Great game. There has been a lot of really good free updates with a lot of content. Lots of different aspects to the game so if you get tired of doing one thing you can easily work on something else. This also gives it a wide appeal range. Good co-op feature for playing with friends. You can get a lot of fun hours out of this game, great buy."
26404,Eliot is a dreamboat!!!!

26409,i played 35 hours in the past 2 weeks so....
26410,good fun
26411,"Absolutely love this game so much! I get a little frustrated with the fishing, I just need some practice.  I really like the pace of the game because you can make it whatever you want. Highly recommend!"
26412,"Good Game, Touching aswell"
26413,Relaxing
26414,"Cool chill game, Actually recommend this game!"
26415,this game is amazing for just relaxing
26416,i literally played this for 15 hours in 2 days help
26417,"One of the most relaxing and wholesome games I've ever played <3 I originally bought this game on switch, but decided to buy in on PC as well. The world building, storytelling and gameplay are all phenomenal and the design of this game is so cute and reminiscent of old pixelart games I played as a kid. Thank you for this game ConcernedApe :) I can't believe you made this game all by yourself."
26418,really good and really relaxing game that is good if you wanna destress
26419,Great
26420,Good game!
26421,"농가로 와서 낚시꾼으로 전직
"
26422,i play silly farming game and flirt with town people. cures all my ailments.
26423,"one of the best in it's genre. works best if played blind and without min-maxing strategies, avoid youtube videos and just play as you like. there are no time limits or bad ways to play. I personally dislike interacting with other NPCs because unlike My Time at Portia I don't feel much connection to them and their quest/personalities feels a bit shallow. 

but it's a great game, goes on sales once every other month and there are even mods if you get bored of the vanilla content.

26424,this game is super fun!! great with friends or even playing solo. also can be both super grindy or u can play casual. highly recommend :D
26425,"Honestly one of the few games I lovingly spend hours and hours on. Was fed up waiting for the 1.5 update for the iPad so I just got a steam account to buy and play the game. (Yes, you can import your saves from iOS to PC! You can check how, here: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Saves . 

Sadly, all my achievements didn't get carried forward- but that just means I can do it all over again!

:D"
26426,"I swear I go through phases with this game, I'll go months without touching it but then one day I'll decided to play it again and it will be one only thing I play for weeks. Needless to say, it's good, very good, and I highly recommend it. 

In other words, if you're reading reviews to decided whether to buy it or not, just do it, give ConcernedApe your money, hell, give me your money and I will reinvest it into one genuine copy of Stardew Valley for you."
26427,i be farmin

26429,This game is very fun

Cute little game, I don't really see any problems with it either, gameplay is good and I had no problems running it

yeah, 9/10

26434,I have put in 134 hrs of stardew valley on steam...plus over 300 on the switch. this is very relaxing and fun game that I would k!ll for! :)

26437,i love my chickens.
26438,Cool Game. Haven't Played It Much Just A Few Minutes. I Just Started.
26439,I think combat is unnecessary for such a game. Combat is also kinda annoying and boring. Other than that it is a really good chill game and amazing for a game that was developed by a single person. I hoped that you could interact more with the town but it is fine.
26440,good game aquiring maidens

This game is a God send for casual players, I'll tell ya. It's hard to be mad at this game when you're the one overreaching because you want to keep going but your character needs to sleep or you know you have no HP and shouldn't go down another level, but you do anyway cause you're trying to get to the next checkpoint. 

This game embodies chill. You can even marry the character of your dreams and have children with them. All the characters have their own story, and you can really vibe with them. The characters in the game are good, in the sense that they hit that ""realism"" where you can connect with the characters and maybe even think of a couple of people in their life that are just like them. They all have their own schedules as well. 

There are seasons in the game and you can upgrade your farm with husbandry, coops, etc. You can go into a dungeon and just adventure. 

It even vibes well as a multiplayer game. One time a group of us were playing and I wanted to be a fisherman so I only fished, another friend was a dungeon crawler, and the third friend was the farmer. We all turn our stuff in to sell/collect at the end of the in-game day, and whenever we're all ready we just progress. It's all chill and wholesome af. 

Literally anyone can play this game. This is also a great way to get the older generation into video games if they never played games before.

Did I mention this was made by one person? Because it was. 

This game released in 02/26/2016. It's 03/26/2022 and Steam is saying this game is ""Currently Popular"".

This game is $15, with a $45-$60 value. 

Need I say more?"

There is just not one way but various ways to have fun in this game like farming , mining , fishing , dating , making friends. This game is definetly worth the price. You can easily download this game without it taking a ton of space. The graphics are simple but good. I'd definetly recommend this game to others."
26465,"best game i pleyed in a long time
"
26466,"Review seems surplus to requirements at this point because the game has been out so long and its clearly a fave with most people, but you know what? It damn well deserves one.

I bought this on a bit of a whim, expecting a easy, throwaway title that would keep me entertained for a handful of hours, doing a little bit of growing, crafting and easy combat.

Stardew Valley has absolutely captured my heart and has had me gripped for over a hundred hours. Far from being simplistic and quick, what I found was a cracking little RPG-lite, with one of the most in depth and, at times, enjoyably complex titles ive played in a long, long time.

I got such a feeling of ""just one more day"" that I found myself up until 2am some nights playing this, wondering where the time had gone and being ok with the fact my 40 year old body was going to hate me in the morning. 

This game will suit anyone looking for an RPG type experience, wanting a huge timesink, with multiple objectives, a sense of growth within the game, and quite a bit of time to dedicate into it. Completioinists will love this one. Yes I reccomend it."

26554,Amazing high quality game with almost infinite replay-ability. Detail is lovingly packed in without becoming so complex that it confuses the player. Beautiful and cute visuals. You will like this if you previously enjoyed collect-athon and/or simulation games. The combat isn't my favorite but it works and doesn't make the mines inaccessible to me.

26606,"This game will stress you out if you don't let go of the expectations that you set for yourself in life. You will be lost with out help. That being said, it is a good lesson. It is okay to be clueless alone. Asking for help is a good thing. Support from a community is what makes society strong. Also this game is not good for people who need a specific agenda, or who get overwhelmed with too much to do. It is good for long distance partners tho."

26615,Chill game with relaxing music.
26616,"this game has everything that I ever wanted from Harvest Moon, and more"
26617,"I will never forget when I discovered the Stardew Valley forum on Chucklefish's website. I was always checking in on the Starbound dev blog when one day I came across this game's forum. I checked that forum every week from when I discovered in 2014 (I think) to when the game was released on Steam in 2016. I bought the game day one, spending the entire weekend playing Stardew Valley. At the time, there were no wikis, no guides, no walkthroughs. There was no maximally efficient system to play the game with... there was just the game. My original playthrough is like nothing I can possibly describe - the extreme stress of making it back to bed before 2:00AM or getting through watering all my crops without running out of energy contrasted with the absolute ease of fishing or just walking around and listening to one of the greatest video game soundtracks of all time is just awe inspiring. Stardew Valley really has the highest highs and the lowest lows that the medium can offer. All that and the game was coded, graphically designed, and soundtracked by ONE PERSON. The gameplay is bar none the greatest of all time. The combat is solid, the farming is better than I ever could have  asked for, the economy of the game is well balanced while leaving multiple avenues to success and not just one optimized solution. The progression system is rewarding, the lore of the game is exciting to find and uncover, and the villagers make for interesting background pieces in a game focused on being a simple farmer. Every little detail in the game seems to be crafted perfectly, as if ConcernedApe left absolutely no stone unturned in the creation of this timeless classic. And yet the game is STILL getting free content updates and was later updated to include seamless multiplayer. When I say that this game is GOATED I mean that this game is absolutely GOATED. If you haven't played the game and enjoy video games in any sense of the word, pick this game up. If you hate video games and think that having fun is a sin, still pick up this game so that ConcernedApe's next title is just as much of a masterpiece."
26618,It's just a masterpiece.
26619,it good
26620,cozy farmer game

26624,"Stardew Valley has so much to offer. Vibrant colors, adventures, twists and turns, and a whole lot of fun. I recommend this game to those who enjoy slice of life, action, and mysteries. It's definitely worth the price and I don't regret it at all! :)"

26652,"I think what really steals the show for me are the little cutscenes you get when you get certain characters to different heart levels. Though relatively simplistic and short due to being rendered through the game's engine, this game has a lot to say through its genuinely interesting npcs, and getting everyone to max hearts is a supremely rewarding task. If for no other reason than this, stardew valley is well worth its price tag. bonus memes: relaxing gameplay, quality soundtrack, and noticeable rpg-style progression."
26653,GOOD GAME
26654,"Really chill game with aspects of everything depending on what you're into.
Similar to the harvest moon games, Stardew Valley is a farming simulator with fun gameplay mechanics such as: fishing, mining, foraging, and 𝐖𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧.

26666,A great game that triggered the nostalgia of the old Harvest Moon games. I had a wonderful time playing on Xbox and have now bought to play again on PC.
26667,Very fun/interesting. Fun to play zooted.
26668,Can pet the dog and kiss your wife and have kids and have a slave army of sentient apples 10/10
26669,"The basics of this game is your character inheriting a farm from your grandfather. While making a new life for yourself you meet the towns folk who you are able to romance and build a life with together. Theres combat, farming, mining, and lots of secrets to uncover. Base game aside; the creator is amazing, they put their heart and soul into this game and its held well over the years. This game is mod compatible! I highly recommend stardew valley extended which can be found on vortex. IT adds more NPCs to romance and interact with as well as add some quality of life mods. ITs a relaxing game that can be played at your own pace. Thanks for coming to my ted talk."

26698,"This game is EXTREMELY good but you probably know that already. I just wanted to say I appreciate that the Stardew Valley I bought a few years ago is the only one I ever had to buy, no DLC, no skins or that bullshit, just some good farming times.

26703,"Such a good and simple game. 

It shows how millions of dollars of investment is not enough to produce something that stays in consumer hearts and made them love it. This game is just plain fun."
26704,"Amazing game, I initially thought it was just a farming sim but it's so much more than just that, would recommend."
26705,I have played this game for hours on pc as well as nintendo switch and ps4. Very relaxing. Very cute. I enjoy filling my farm with animals.
26706,i will always enjoy playing and replaying this
26707,vv nice

26717,"Got this for Christmas (2021), and have played it almost every day. I literally cannot pinpoint my favorite things from this, it's all fantastic. If you've played Animal Crossing, Sims, Harvest Moon, etc., then you'll probably love this."
26718,"This is a game full of content that is made with a lot of love from the creator. If you want a game to spend quality time with friends or alone, this is it."
26719,yeye its cool uh stardew valley

26733,"This game is so addictive it borders on illegal! It's not my typical game at all, I tend to like more action in what I play, but there is something so calming, so basic, so pure, and so intangible about Stardew Valley that it somehow makes typically tedious chores enjoyable. I can find no good way of describing the gameplay itself - I've tried several times and it always sounds boring, derivative, and full of contradictions. On the one hand, it is mindless fun, but on the other you need to plan every waking minute and consider the future. On the one hand it is very repetitive, but on the other every day is unique. On the one hand, it's so simple you can start playing immediately, but on the other I have the wiki page open constantly. It really is something you need to experience to understand. 
The game's strongest point is also its most frustrating: it objectively has the best paced gameplay loop in any game ever, period, full stop. It is perfectly designed so that you start a day, check on one or two things, and then you realize half the day is gone, and you might as well finish the day, rinse, repeat. It's immensely enjoyable, but immensely difficult to stop playing.
I'd highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a break from the stress of traditional games."
26734,"amo jogar com victor e misa amo eles

26735,"lots to do, great game."
26736,i lik it
26737,"Really cool game! 
Heard Crypticfox talking about it and decided to check it out."
26738,"Stardew is an amazing game created by a really down to earth developer. There are a lot of different aspects of the game to discover, many different paths to pursue and cutscenes to enjoy! I have over 600 hours in this game on my various consoles, and highly recommend it to everyone."

26766,"fish, mine, farm. FUN!"
26767,"A really easy timesink & super fun, wish it had a better tutorial system but honestly its super fun and intuitive as you get into it. Much more than a farming simulator & honestly good for people of all ages"
26768,"Not your average farming simulator. This game feels like a complex world of it's own, full of life and personality and story, yet also managing to be a great technical experience as a farming sim. I love interacting with all of the townspeople as well as retreating back to my private farm. This truly is an open-ended world, as you can build your farm as a total hermitage for maximum profits or live a simple village life, socializing with everyone in town and building intimate relationships. There are mysteries to discover and so many different parts of this deceptively small world to explore, you will not be bored by this game. I recommend this game to anyone who is even remotely considering playing it. It will be worth the time you will inevitably dedicate to it."
26769,LOVE this game. You can play the base game and have hours of enjoyment or if you're up for it there's so many mods you can try out. Def recommend for people that love farming games. A game i love to relax and play and with the new multiplayer update we can now play with friends!

26780,"Sebastian is bae <3

On a more serious note, ConcernedApe has been an inspiration for ages and I can only hope that his life has been as blissful as my character's life in Stardew Valley has been."
26781,"For anyone that loves minecraft, you'll love Stardew just as much. Sure, you have less creativity, but it's so calming and stress-free, I would want to play this all day long. I started out having watched 1 or 2 videos of someone else playing it for the first time, so I had no idea how to properly start. But now after watching a few guides and stuff, it's even more fun for me to play cuz i know i can keep improving the way i want to build my farm and how to more easliy please the other people that live in Stardew Valley.
Long story short: I love it!!"
26782,"Honestly Stardew Valley is such a cute and wholesome game, I just can't get  tired of it ^-^"
26783,The only reason I have only 300 hours here is cause I own it on every other platform too.
26784,"Stardew Valley is so addicting for so many reasons. It's so cute, and relaxing, and I can't stop playing. This game, in my opinion is pure perfection <3"

26806,Pretty good game.
26807,"As a longtime player of the Harvest Moon (or technically Story of Seasons) franchise, this definitely exceeded my expectations. Although this game does pay homage to the HM games, I feel that some of the features that they got from the HM games should have been removed or improved, as it makes the game feel more archaic than it should be. Still, this game is great compared to the other recent games in the genre--which is bittersweet considering the genre's current state."
26808,luv this game :3

A true passion project made by one person that shines and has me excited for their next game, definitely worth paying full price."

26888,"Its a nice chill game you can basically play at your own pace theres no real end goal, but alot of people strive for 100% achievements or doing the community center in one year that sorta thing"

26895,Great game. Amazing plot with incredible detail! Definitely worth the money!
26896,"A true labor of love.
Depression healer.
Inexpensive, yet extensive.
Frequently updated and expanded.
The best ""Harvest Moon"" game to date.

It's not about the ""premise"" of the game, which may seem silly at first glance. It's about how the game makes you feel, and the pleasant, relaxed state it puts you in while playing.

Can't recommend Stardew Valley enough. A true masterpiece."
26897,"If you are looking for a game like Animal Crossing than this is a fantastic game for you. I've been playing it for over a year now and it is still so engaging. You can fish, farm, and mine. I love all the different collectibles and the graphics are adorable. I can't remember a time when I was bored of this game!! 10/10, 5 stars!!! 
"

26902,
26903,"Stardew valley is a really nice game that teaches you about communicating, and farming. This sandbox game is entertaining but as you progress through the game things don't really change that much, making it less entertaining as it would be. It does a wonderful job portraying real world events such as marriage, farming, and buying things with money. As an addition to the shopping concept, players can sell items to earn more, This helps them become more hardworking in real life. Overall, I think this game is a really nice game for people new to sandbox games because of it's wide variety of characters with different personalities and traits. It has many interesting twists and fantasy based aspects. This game does have a big price tag though so I would rate it 4.7/5 stars."
26904,Still one of the most chill and pleasant gaming experiences available. Years of content patches and now mod support have only served to make this even more of an endless source of fun.
26905,"As someone who loved Harvest Moon games when I was a child, this game brought back my love for it in every sense of the way. It's damn near perfect. I love getting to be so custom and do just about anything."
26906,"I love this game, If you enjoy interactions with NPC's then this is the game for you. I enjoyed triggering all of the events each NPC had to offer. I am now replaying this game with the Stardew Valley extended mod. <3 11/10 would recommend to friends."
26907,Very relaxing
26908,"Growin crops, doin drugs with wizards"
26909,"Very peaceful, the music relaxes you, and is great to play with friends"
26910,One of the best games for relaxing after a hard day
26911,very fun to play with a friend but i do get lost sometimes
26912,i like to farm my funny little vegetables and walk around and meet funny little people. also theres a funny wizard cmon best game evar
26913,Great game.
26914,"For a game developed by one guy alone it's astounding. The characters, the story line, story and player progression, all of it. CA did an amazing job putting this game together. The different tasks you can do and choices you're given are fantastic, not to mention the art is also really nice to look at. He created an appealing game with great design and is very user friendly. This is the kind of game literally ANYONE can play if they understood the basic ""break, craft, place"" mechanics!!! :D"
26915,"Very good game, there is no end to it!"
26916,"Just when you thought you were done, Stardew Valley Expanded pulls you back in!
P.S. co-op is the best thing to ever be added to this game"
26917,Great Game! good for escapism
26918,quite funky
26919,"Such a great game with an amazing community. Its simple, stressfree... You can play in any way you want. The game guides you through for the full experience, buts lets say that you don't want to play the story and JUST want to farm. No prob, you can! Maybe you love collecting gems in the mines? AWESOME DO IT! So many options and possibilities for play-through that you can play over and over however you want."
26920,"This is such a nice game to play when taking a break from competitive shooters and other things. I feel like I’m actually creating something. And with the different personalities in the town, it makes it way more interesting to try and become friends with them. Please try this at least once I’ve never been so calm."
26921,yumyum
26922,Still not free from capitalism... 3 Days.
26923,its ok ig
26924,could play for hours and hours!!
26925,love
26926,Yes i love this game! I used to play Harvest Moon on gameboy and this game is very much like it. So if you like harvest moon and farm simulators you're gonna love this game.
26927,A true masterpiece. An astounding work of art. An eloquent slice of escapism. A relaxing excursion to a place that can never be. I now have a potent heartbreaking nostalgia for a place that doesn't exist. 10/10 would recommend.
26928,"""I really like the walking mechanics"" - My Brother
 Easily one of the most wholesome games I've played to date. This game really reminds me of when I used to play Animal Crossing, at least in the sens of community it offers, as well as its (mostly) relaxed tone.
The gameplay itself can be a little slow going at first, and maybe a bit confusing, but overall it's a fantastic game to relax to and sink some hours into. 

Note: My hour count is a little skewed. I originally played on console for a couple years, and just recently started playing on PC."
26929,Very fun very chill
26930,It's a fun farming simulator. Very similar to Harvest Moon but completely original.
26931,es
26932,"Great game , absolutely love it"
26933,This game is always a go to game when idk what i want to play. But when I first launched this game and herd this nostalgic calming music I felt like I was home. The soothing soundtrack and the cool interaction with the characters and the laid back play style of this game are all worth the games price. No matter when the many hours I've played this game draws me back every time and I always discover something new each time. It never gets old. I can truly say that this game is a classic in my eyes
26934,sam <3
26935,This game is an absolute delight. If you enjoy farming and simulation games you WILL love this game.
26936,i called my cat deez nuts :)
26937,"Fantastic game. The detailed story, calming music... Just an athmospheric game :)"
26938,"Started playing this after watching my gf play it and I thought it looked cool and then I started sinking some hours into it and I was enjoying it and I felt a nice feeling of completion and then I carried on and sank a LOT of hours into it and kept on going, I then realised that there was way more content in this game than I imagined and it was also gave more so much more enjoyment than I had anticipated. 

This game is very fun and has a lot more to it than it looks. Surprisingly it is very fun especially considering this isn't my type of game."
26939,What a incredible game!
26940,"Audiance is teens and older, Games easy to learn, but dont complain if you go in blind and skip the opening cutscene.
Graphics are nice and you wont really need a strong device to play.
Gameplay lenght is so long it made a mid section between long and infinity and beyond for those checkbox reviews.
And if it looks like some boring farm game, you're wrong, theres combat, romance, story events, fishing, collecting. all of that.
Hm. i wonder what news thing i will discover on haunted chocoalier?"
26941,good good game yes
26942,this game is nice :)
26943,"to keep this review short and spoiler-free, I will just say that the base game is amazing, there's a ton of post-game stuff to do, and it has loads of replayability. If you like Harvest Moon / Story of Seasons games, then this is for you.

I don't have very many hours on PC because I'm getting *back* into it. I initially started playing on my Switch, and I've got like 200+ hours on there. I purchased this game on PC so I could play the Stardew Valley Expanded mod. The SDVE mod is also amazing, but I would recommend downloading it after going through the regular game so you get the experience of the actual game first, of course.

overall, this game and its many mods are great, and I cannot wait for the dev's next games in the future."
26944,funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
26945,"Bought it for my PC, Switch and my Phone. So clearly love it. Worth every penny."
26946,fun
26947,"Absoutely a soul refreshing game that has kept me going in the hardest of times. I don't think I could get bored with Stardew even if it's the same day playing out over and over again. Stardew Valley has given me that little spark of hope in my life where it's hard to find any especially in a time in the world where things are downhill sitting down to be in Pelican Town has been the most relaxing and best escape there is. I've learned alot morally and otherwise about the struggles and gains of those in the agricultural world and have grown a new respect for others lives in general, all from a simple game, from a simple Developer, who has all our hearts in mind. Thank you ConcernedApe for all you've given us."
26948,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
26949,Very very good
26950,this game slays
26951,"Bought this game on mobile, switch, and now PC. It's that addictive. Hands down, favorite game."

26963,i have done tax fraud
26964,1
26965,Stardew Valley is the shittest game to play. it is a legit copy of minecraft but in 2D. developers are so desperate
26966,this game has singlehandedly ruined whatever sleep schedule i managed to accidentally get within the past few months and you know what? i don't regret it. this game is so GOOD i am genuinely obsessed it's constantly on my mind even when im not playing it's kinda insane actually lol anyway long story short i love it
26967,By far one of the best games I have ever plaed
26968,Genuinely one of my favorite games of all time. Stardew Valley is my anti-depressant.
26969,"Plenty of replayability, not just a harvest moon simulator, there is story, shenanigans and secrets that can only be found out as you progress through the story."
26970,"I really couldn't relate to the game as much since none of the characters or the marriage candidates aren't addicted to cocaine, but its fine ig."
26971,"literally so fun
"
26972,once i started i was addicted !
26973,I mean. It’s Stardew Valley.
26974,good
26975,Very gud Very fun 101/102 would recommend to gamers and gaes : )
26976,"i have never been this addicted to a game, help me please"

26983,"s'good
"
26984,love this game
26985,20/10
26986,great game for killing time or just something numb to play that is low intensity high reward. very much like harvest moon or animal crossing.
26987,I frequently go through periods of time where I live exclusively in this game rather than living my real life.
26988,Super fun and interactive
26989,Such a relaxing game <3
26990,"its stardew valley, its just stardew valley"
26991,Girlfriend really enjoys it.
26992,"I have only started this today, yet I am on the fourth day of summer and having a great time. A friend of mine gifted this to me. I recommend this game to anyone who is into games based on farming and relationships with characters. I suck at writing reviews so I hope this works"
26993,"chill game, i play it with my friends a lot. Would recommend if you have a small friend group of 3-4 people."
26994,asik banget ini cokkkkkkkkkk kalo kau suka game yang santai dan seperti harpes mun.
26995,"Like: everything
Dislike: how little time I actually have to play the game"
26996,"It's the sweetest game ever made for the PC, and it's why I still don't care about Harvest Moon, although it does look pretty sick ngl."
26997,fun

26999,GUT GAME
27000,nice
27001,"Lets me farm with the homies and get mad when they buy 1,000 dollars worth of gifts for there imaginary girlfriends (because they lack them in the real world)."
27002,just a fun addicting lil time killer..
27003,"stardew valley is one, if not my favorite, games in the world. i'm still pretty new to gaming (less than three years), but i absolutely love this game with my entire heart. it got me through a slow healing knee surgery for four months and i still love to play this game a year later."
27004,"Vanilla: 9.2
With Mods: 9.7"
27005,The soundtrack is chef's kiss. Also whenever I play this game I feel relax and calm :))
27006,"This game gives you an immersive look at the farming life while sprinkling in a bit weirdness, by giving the choices of who to form a friendship with and what to prioritize, whether it'd be growing crops and performing the duties of a farmer, or choosing to fish or mine the dangerous, enemy-filled caves. with this comes other hard like to worry about the NPCs and their thoughts of you, or to worry about your farm and perform your job to the best you can. With that in mind the game lets you complete quests, get married, and even learn everyone's true thoughts and who they truly are. On specific days, festival events will take place allowing you to buy seasonal items and decor for your house. You should definitely get the game for your self if you are looking for a game depicting these characteristics, if you do get the game, more surprises are awaiting, Have Fun."
27007,Like an improved old school harvest moon.
27008,really great game
27009,farm teehee
27010,Fun times with fun friends

27014,"warning, this game is addiction material, bought it yesterday and its single handedly raised my urge to play games"
27015,The only game I can marry an emo programmer and also farm parsnips on a beach. 11/10 would recommend.
27016,awooga
27017,"this game is amazing, and i'm sure it's great for many other people but i do geniunely dislike it. There's too much to do and nothing that says what you're supposed to do. You have to balance quests, skills, social relations, farming, animals, fighting, fishing, mining, and your gold count all in a limited amount of time, especially considering a day lasts like 5 minutes and people Still say ""yea this game is easy to pick up"". Even if you did spend months learning everything there is in this game that just sucks out all the enjoyment and turns the game into a tedious simulator where you just wait around and don't feel accomplished at all. I get this game is well-liked, and My God did the developer spend so much time on this game that even though i can't derive any enjoyment out of it, I still feel really bad giving a negative review"
27018,"Alright folks, here it is. 

If you're thinking of buying this game: do it. do it now. 

If you think this game is boring: you weren't ready for the VAST majority of things to do in this game... plus, you were in too much of a rush.

And finally... if you think this game is a ""grind"": why? there's no required amount of time needed to do anything in this game. It's a beautiful walk in the park, it's not meant to be 'easy' to start up right off the bat, but trust me... it'll come to you pretty gosh darn fast.

I don't play this game to spendrun, I don't play this game to stress myself with challenges... I play this game because it's got a little bit of everything, and I'm STILL learning how to play, even 210 hours in. 

The beauty of Stardew Valley is how many different play styles you can explore and test. Farming may be the main source of income, but there are many others ways to bring in the dough! 

I've had this game in my library since 2017, but it wasn't until this year that I was really able to dive in and appreciate it. What Eric (ConcernedApe) has made here is a one in a million kind of gaming experience, don't pass up a chance to live through this game.

Additionally, I suggest playing your first save WITHOUT any modding whatsoever. Get a feel for the game as it was created, without the help/changes from mods first. It was MUCH easier to take the game in during my first run without any mods, and now it's much easier to pick mods/use mods because I know the game. 

There is also a TON of Stardew Valley content on YouTube meant for beginners of the game, because it's such an extensive game even right from the start. So if you need a hand or your feeling frustrated, go to YouTube before giving the game up. It's worthwhile."
27019,"this game is really good with mods! the mods are very small files, so you can get a lot of them. right now, im running 38 mods!"
27020,"Girlfriend, not lonely"
27021,slayed
27022,This gives me serotonin.
27023,I have now bought this game on every platform. Its so calming and beautiful. I recommend this game to everyone! For new and seasoned gamers :)
27024,"when i first saw this it was kinda werid, but now after getting hands-on with it, it actually isn't bad at all. Quite relaxing and calms down your mind after a long day of competitive games."
27025,gay people
27026,"I prefer it with mods otherwise it's just too slow for me personally, but otherwise good game"
27027,"its a nice low key at your own pace game, i have been playing for quite a few years.

27028,Krobus and I have entered an uneasy alliance against women.

27043,I have nearly 200 hours and yet I haven't played through year 2 in most saves... 10/10 would start a new save again :D
27044,The most relaxing game I have ever played. So cute and finding mods have made it 10x better too!
27045,Farm pog
27046,FUNNNN CHILLY GAME YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME IF YOU ARE AN UWU GIRL WHO LIKES TO COLLECT FLOWERS IN MINECRAFT. OTHER PEOPLE LOVE IT TOO THOUGH SO PLAY IT ANYWAY
27047,Super fun game and the story and characters makes you want to invest more time into the game
27048,"so relaxing, could spend hours playing this game.

i play this on imac (2017 version) and it runs perfectly.
the game holds so many secrets like (in sams trashbin go back when hes not there) just slight secrets that may have a meaning later on in the game (like the mayors shorts) but its honestly well worth the time, i play this game on xbox too, just download it bro its amazing never bores you because theres more to discover everyday C:"
27049,Yes. Very fun with friends
27050,It's like Harvest Moon but fun and well designed
27051,I love stardew valley! It help me unwind after a long day and just relax. I had been a bit hesitant because it was a pixel game but its swiftly become one of my favorites.
27052,"Probably the best harvest-moon type games I've ever played, and they are STILL YET updating with new content. 11/10, will be playing forever"
27053,"Slept in the same single bed as my 2 friends, offered one my wood, got shown a dark shaft and kept getting lost... 5 very short days in and it's all very confusing so far"
27054,good
27055,i absolutely love this game 10/10 characters
27056,I like it
27057,Really good farming sim and they arent really my style. I enjoyed splunking prob the most. I know theres alot more content that I havent reached but the game kinda loses my interest near the end of year 1 or completion of the community center. Ill try to put in a more complete save but just not at the time.
27058,Let us romance mommy Jodi and Sandy
27059,its really good i love this
27060,"I bought this to waste a few hours when I was bedridden with the flu and boy, has it been a ride. 

It's a fun, very relaxing, incredibly well made game, with a very consistent and distinct voice. I especially enjoy the fact that the game doesn't push you to progress in any specific way, and yet I strive to try everything because it's just that enjoyable. Highly recommend."
27061,love
27062,"Super great game to play co-op with your friends. Its amazing getting to manage a whole farm and balancing your money. I didnt want to play by myself and doubts about it but multiplayer is really a great feature to have.
Hope there would be more events and updates to things so that there would be more stuff to do but overall great game."
27063,"this game is honestl amazing, it surpassing any game i've ever played. the characters? amazing. the graphics? amazing. the gameplay? amazing. theres something for everyone. you can grind in the mines, decorate a beautiful farm, interact with colorful npcs, etc. i love it, i think its a must-play for everyone"
27064,YES
27065,ohh hel yea
27066,.
27067,Good game for bing chilling
27068,good game
27069,very nice harvey is on y rob list
27070,Stardew Valley is one of the greatest farming games I have played. Definitely recommended :)
27071,"A friend got me into this game. I'm not usually the biggest fan of ""cozy"" games, but I do like more laid back games like ""Papers, Please"" and ""Not Tonight."" This game was very good - has excellent progressive unlocks that make the game never boring. Is relatively relaxing and offers a lot of freedom with how you want to play the game - you can farm if you want, go full forage and fishing... Whatever suits you.

There is also a horse in the game. I'm very happy with this. I named my horse ""Trottingham."""
27072,"I had to write review for my 69.9 hour mark. This game good, if you no get, you big old not-puss."
27073,"100% would recommend!! It's so addicting and so fun to play, it's even better with friends!!"

27086,Well. Stardew Valley is the kind of game where its like ''Oh hey this is a game i own'' but then you have 72 hours of playtime and an addiction. If you have some time to kill get this game
27087,I restarted my save because I felt bad after accidentally missing the egg festival
27088,I’ve bought this game on all my consoles and now on steam (which is why i only have around 6 hours on steam) its a great game and you can basically do whatever you want like dating all the bachelors or bachelorettes at one time. Highly recommend.

27121,"Great little (even though it's quite large in content) indie game. Very relaxing to burn your hours away, and made by a hardworking and trustworthy developer. Really is no other game quite like it!"
27122,"It's a great game, Love the style and the tempo. I play at your own pace game for a good chill"
27123,This game is incredibly peaceful and is a good game to play if you just want to relax to. Due to its pixel graphics it is lightweight but still incredibly beautiful. I would recommend this game to people who enjoy role playing games. Forming friendships with the NPCs in this game is rewarding and seeing your farm slowly grow is a truly amazing experience.
27124,haven't touched grass after playing this game
27125,aye
27126,"10/10 game, tons of things to enjoy, tons to do and generaly fun"
27127,"Stardew Valley has been a comfort game to me for a while, I've always seen myself turn to this game when I was in a bad spot or maybe just bored. It's so simple, and the aesthetic of the game in general is just fun to look at. Maybe it's the fact that I fell in love with indie farming games, or maybe that this game is just one of those things you easily get attached to but I'm addicted. The first day I got this during quarantine times, I played it for 18 hours straight. Not the best look on me, but let that leave an impression. I'm so glad I bought this game, and I'm looking forward to the future of ConcernedApe and his games!"
27128,Fun with friends
27129,Amazing.
27130,krobus
27131,"very good game, 10/10 would farm again"
27132,IT IS GOOD!!!!!
27133,Peaceful and relaxing game with great content
27134,"This is probably one of the most addicting games I’ve ever played. As simple as it seems you wouldn’t believe how engaging it is. The format is easy and quick to learn. Once you get the swing of things the time rolls by hour after hour with no end in sight. It’s the perfect game to sit back and relax. Playing with friends is also a good time when everyone can contribute to the farm. Choosing between farming, ranching, fishing, and mining make this game the most exciting. You can stick to one or two or do a little of all. The social aspects of this game are also a gem. The characters are all funny and likable in their own way. Building friendships with characters is fun between the constant days of work to be done. All in all you’re getting a highly addictive and fun to play farm management game with much more than meets the eye. Best $15 I’ve ever spent. Check it out!"
27135,countless hours will be used on this game. you have been warned
27136,its so calming and cute i want to squeeze it.
27137,"Amazing Game
"
27138,"Very cute game, low-pressure but still a ton of depth"
27139,Similar to Harvest Moon. Could play for hours. Desired to complete missions and build relationship with town people. Going to bed is a big mission.
27140,"This game has a good sense of progression. The more I play, it gets better.
Its hard and inefficient at first but once you got those sweet upgrades its very rewarding.
This is a relaxing game indeed!"
27141,Its pretty fun. I like the fishing and constraints that keep the game interesting and unique

27144,"This game is absolutely fantastic. My other favorite games are Minecraft and Breath of the Wild, so if you like those games but are looking for something different, this is the game to buy. If you ever get stuck the Wiki is awesome."

27167,"This is a great relaxing game to play and get lost in. With it's practically infinite game play and customization, this makes a great game for a present for any people in your life, it's a game sure to remember and make great memories with. Also allowing multiplayer meaning you can spend this precious time with your friends! Or just playing solo and progressing at an incredible rate could be an option. Along with the game comes a great handful of content creators who make this game more the fun to play!"

27172,Lowkey got me interested in plants. Also this game has so many secrets that I would have not known before hand. I thought it was just gonna be minecraft farming with terraria graphic art style but this game got me addicted. It is fun to interact with characters and there is so much to do!

27179,I enjoy this game because there is always something new to do.
27180,A heart warming game with so much love for detail and even more to explore.
27181,"One of the most touching and memorable games I have ever come across. Stardew Valley is an exceptional blend of familiar titles (Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Rune Factory, etc.) which come together to create something far greater than the sum of its parts. Featuring remarkable characters, stimulating gameplay, and a quaint, cozy vibe that I've longed for in PC gaming -- this game is an era-defining masterpiece that ranks among my all-time favorites.

10/10"
27182,Good
27183,Its a great game that reminds me of terraria and animal crossing
27184,"This game is absolutely wonderful, the NPCs and marriage candidates have amazing story-lines and backgrounds, plus all of their heart-event cutscenes are interesting and individual to each NPC. There is not one thing I can think of that is a 'negative' about this game. Every second of playing is so much fun and very engaging. 11/10!"
27185,"good
"
27186,its really fun to be useful for tasks. and its quite nice to enjoy company with friends to build a homestead.

"
27199,Nothing negative to say about this game. The amount of effort and detail put into making this game is incredible and it transports you to another world. Anyone and everyone should play this game at least once in their life.

27214,if you like farming then this is the game for you its amazing!
27215,"I liked this game, it was fun and relaxing. 

My wife has turned it into a lifestyle. She doesn't really play video games, but she is obsessed.She makes spreadsheets. She has sticky notes all over her desk. She mutters about Krobus in her sleep. Help. 

10/10"
27216,"I only have 18 hours played upon reviewing this, however these 18 hours were played almost completely consecutively. This game is so addictive, the interactions with the townspeople really keep me coming back. There's a good enough balance of autonomy for it to really feel like you are carrying the town. Absolutely love this game."
27217,"Excellent game to zone-out and relax to.  Sit down, have a snack and a beverage, and grow some turnips while you romance the lady (or guy) of your choice and build up your farm as you... fight to save your small town from Jeff Bezos. (Not kidding. The ""bad guys"" if you can call them that are an Amazon parody.)  Good game. Highly recommended at any price."
27218,So addicting haley is so sexy im gonna s.e.x her
27219,Amazing to think that this game is an one-man job.
27220,"one of the two games ive ever played obsessively, the best thing about it is: i loved Harvest Moon as a kid and stopped being a gamer after my gameboy broke. thank you 10ml for gifting this on my birthday and making me feel like a carefree kid again :3

27233,"If you enjoyed the game Harvest Moon from back in the day, then this is the game for you!  Its pixelated making it easier to run on your laptop or PC.  It will suck you in for hours without realizing it."
27234,This is a lovely game. I love to come home from work and relax while playing this game!
27235,Escape real life by doing things you can do in real life in a video game.

27266,thanks to this game I'm now addicted to collecting pixelated vegetables
27267,"Most intense gaming experience I have ever had. Like nothing I've ever played before. Exhilarating game-play accompanied with the most intense combat, arguable more difficult than Dark Souls. Though that game falls in comparison to this masterpiece. Truly 10/10"

27270,"Really fun game, chill and the stories you can experience while going the the game at your own pace are beautifully told - This is the same for how the characters grow and change throughout your friendships. 
Worth the money and goes on sale most seasons, beautiful graphics and the way you can customize all throughout the game makes it entirely up to you how you play and experience it."

27272,Fun and a bit addicting
27273,good

27277,"its a chill game you can play with your friend(if you have any) or just play by yourself.
"
27278,"The villagers are greedy so that sucks. Can't find love without gifts. Can't be poor. The game doesn't like that. I like farming. Hate how much time it takes. Love mining. Again, I hate how much time it takes. ;_; I want aminals but I haves no moneysss. REEEEEEEEEEEEEE!"

I really love it. At the time of this review I have 454hours in this game and I can't get enough.
The relaxing, yet addictive nature of this game is what got me through college. You can even play with your friends now and it can be some super fun and charming times.

I recommend this game to practically anyone."
27286,Yeah its ok
27287,"yeah
"
27288,fun good for kids and it doesn't need internet :)
27289,yeah
27290,DO NOT MESS WITH YOUR FILES! this game is absolutely amazing but if you mess with anything you'll never be able to play it on your device again.

27297,Yes.
27298,Cant bang elliot :(
27299,"I was on the fence with Stardew for a couple of years, I didnt know if it would be the game for me. I regret not getting it sooner. This game is very cute, the barn animals are really fun to take care of and get products from. The thing about Stardew is that no matter how long you play it, there is still something to do, if not, start a new save a different farm layout. If you like farming and taking care of animals, just get it. You also make friends with everyone in town, the residents all have their own unique story. Not to mention, as you play, you learn secrets about people and or more things to do in Pelican town."
27300,You can marry Harvey.
27301,yeah
27302,"fire, id bust a nut to it"
27303,I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!!!!!
27304,Favorite game ever.
27305,"This is a gem of a game with a wonderful creation story, an indie game by Eric Barone that became a cult favorite and has a wonderful community. I cannot wait for the next game which proves to be just as endearing. This game has depth you wouldn't expect and the backstories of the characters are immersive. Even if you think it's not your play style the price point makes it worth the obsession you may also find yourself sucked into. The addition of multiplayer makes it so much more engaging and sometimes frustrating."
27306,"Super fun, especially with mods!"
27307,"This game is very fun and relaxing. I don't think i've ever played a game which is so simple yet contains so much fun, new and exciting content. It truly is my favorite game and the soundtrack is relaxing as the play. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys any type of gaming.  You won't regret it"
27308,yes
27309,best game
27310,literally no-lifed this game with my friends since i bought the game 4 days ago. you do not escape this game. also i love sebastian <3

27315,muy bueno.
27316,farm
27317,"One of the best games ever made, and I will die on that hill. ConcernedApe is an extremely talented developer and deserves all the praise he's received. Overall score: 1000/10"
27318,don't play. will consume you.
27319,"Stardew Valley is an excellent game and after 120 hours on 1 play, I can say with certainty that it is worth the cost. The game has so many fine details and the world is amazing. I highly recommend it."
27320,"very fun, relaxing, enjoyable, just an amazing game overall. 10/10"
27321,oh yeah
27322,Anything but tangerines
27323,addictively relaxing
27324,"Such a cute, immersive game. Visually appealing, great characters, and just challenging enough to keep it interesting."
27325,"If you've not played this game yet, then I don't know where you've been.  Cozy and relaxing atmosphere and building your farm is only the tip of the iceberg.  Help a wizard with his marital problems, help a mayor with his secret love affair, make friends with a salty old fisherman and get married to a demon guy who lives in the sewers.  All this while making your grandfather proud...or not, it's your choice."
27326,"Stardew Valley is everything that an indie farming sim is supposed to be, plus more! I love the seeing the individual character stories, participating in town events, discovering new areas, and (of course) designing a farm. Very cute, very fun, will always be a favorite of mine.
Also, huge fan of the co-op feature. There are some ways it could be improved, but for the most part, works very well. Stardew is great to play with friends, or even with strangers (making friends!)"
27327,Awesome game. Could not recommend more.
27328,gspkoinu
27329,I have wet-dreams about the concerned ape. (and linus).
27330,my most favorite most comforting game i love it in a gigantonormous way
27331,This game is perfect if you love simple gameplay and design. There are tons of ways to mod it too to make it your own.
27332,"I would totally recommend this game, especially if you want a game that relax while you play. I would definitely recommend this game!"
27333,most peaceful game ive ever played bro
27334,so fun bro omg!!!! (literally like so addicting.)
27335,pretty indie boy and emo girl
27336,"Very good game, its easy to lose track of time while playing just saying ""1 more day"" for like 10 days in a row"
27337,"Harvest Moon meet Terraria. That's how I'd describe this game. And I absolutely love it. The game really makes you work for it's achievements, and changing one thing can really affect how easily or difficult things are for you, within your little farm area. I personally enjoy the mountain top ranch type, over the others. It gives your farm a unique look. I'd say it's worth it for sure, but you'll have to try it out yourself."
27338,poe

"
27396,"as a redditor and avid poster on r/memes and r/anime (amassing over 500,000 karma in my career) i have never been outside, touched grass or interacted with another person within the past decade. i was seriously considering having to go outside at one point due to  wanting to fill the crippling void within myself but luckily, Stardew Valley has replaced all need to ever interact with the outside world as in this game i am able touch grass without going outside, interact with women and exist under the sun for more than three minutes without increasing my risk of melanoma due to my deficiency of melanin in my skin from a lack of being outdoors. returning to the topic of interacting women, i have to commend on stardew valley's depth within friendship and romance mechanics as gifting suffices as a foundation for friendship for the game which is a skill that i have developed to a high proficiency before my retraction from society. although i was well developed in the art of gifting in the real world (even visiting people multiple times everyday according to their schedules) they all called me a 'stalker' and told me to 'never speak to me again.' frankly i don't know what's wrong with them, i'd have to assume that they're glitched and only show the dialogue for hated gifts. in fact i got so attached to Stardew Valley that my own wife left me after i quit my job to spend as much time as possible on Stardew with Abigail and my child (who i named Grubbie) but my wife told me that i 'needed to stop playing that game' and to 'get a job so you can support your daughter.' i don't know what she's talking about, i had to explain that i make 40,000 g per day on ancient fruit alone so we can live just fine and that was the last time i ever saw her or my daughter again. i should probably ask mayor Lewis if he knows where they went. anyways, i am writing this review so that i can share my experience before i lose my house as i have been sent threatening letters in my mail box regarding my 'unpaid rent and bills' but as far as i know, Stardew never required you to pay rent and Stardew is completely true to life! i'll try and see if robin can make me a new house before they cut off my power as without my computer i can't play Stardew and i don't know what i would do without Stardew Valley."
27397,"This game takes me back to my childhood of playing Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town on my GBA. If you're a fan of Harvest Moon, you'll love this game."
27398,Great game for people who likes to play exploring/grinding games. The game is full of adventure and in fact there is loads of secret quests so be cautious on every detail. Big fan of the game i do recommend it to others.

27409,yes
27410,"Incredibly beautiful, fun and sincere game with a ton of content."
27411,"TL'DR: This game has been a fun journey for me. I can honestly say if you're looking for a game that you can enjoy both solo or with friends, (even doing both runs simultaneously) this is definitely one of those games. So you wanna go fight? Go gettem! You wanna relax and fish? By alllllll means. You wanna actually be a farmer? Who'd have thought, use that green thumb! Lumberjack fantasies? Plenty of trees for ya. Or maybe you like dwarfssss? ROCK AND STONE! cough you get the idea, as it is a sandbox game. It's got a little bit of everything in just the right amounts. It is not JUST another farming sim though, this game is that and more, -as fighting, exploration, and interacting with the locals is a big part of progression and the experience. If you're still on the fence however, keep reading and I give a little more depth to help you along.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To start, after 230 hours I have yet to complete everything this game has to offer, though I can say I have already reached the end game, and am pretty deep into the content that came out with the last major update. That said, I will avoid any unnecessary spoilers in this review. 

Solo Run: Year 3, spring 27 (135 hours)
Group run total (aprox 100 hours) longest group run: year 2 winter 24

This is mostly to show I've split my time pretty evenly. (I actually probably spent more time on my solo due to pausing, afk, and wiki reading lol).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MY OVERVIEW:
Starting with the basics, your days start at 6am, and end between 12am-2am.
Each in game hour is a minute, so a day is about 18 min, to max 20 min long.
That means you can easily go through an entire season in two 5 hour sessions, OR if there's a day you and your buds have off each week where that's your gaming day, you can definitely squeeze in one season in one sit.

Starting out, you're pretty limited in what you can do as taking actions like hoeing, watering, fishing, or cutting trees costs energy, and when you run out of energy, you cant do much else. Each season offers different crops, different events, and different fish. What's nice is that you can check all your progress in game. It keeps a tally of all the money you've earned overall, and what items you've sold off (when placed in your shipping bin). Your skill list is up to date as you gain XP, so you'll know if you're about to rank up. Every skill has craftable items you gain by leveling up in each category. You can choose to focus on one skill or do multiple at a time. You can check everything you've turned in, and your relationship status with the people in town, all from your menu. The progression curve feels pretty smooth, and getting better tools or gear ALMOST ALWAYS feels like a pretty big turning point, or achievement.

It may come as no surprise that your main source (and best source) of income is farming, although you can still make your money mining or fishing and selling things you get. You can also level all these as skills, and acquire perks to help you along. It's certainly not as grindy as other sandbox games though, and while overwhelming at first due to timed days, it isn't too hard to get the hang of the learning curve.

STORY: 8.5/10
The story (which you'll get immediately in the intro) is that you leave your soul sucking job to live out in the country and enjoy life. (I think some of us wish we could do that haha). It's a simple premise, though you do get to choose either settling back into that life, or fighting against it once you get there with these two routes; Help the community, or give back into the soul sucking company you left. Most of the characters are pretty charming and seem stereotypical up front until you learn their tragic anime back story (It really does feel that dramatic at times. Like ""whatta you mean you kille-"") oh sorry. It's okay, you'll never see it coming, (if you even find the quest line.  <_<  ) ....But anyway some characters feel incomplete, or undynamic, and with so much of that dynamicism in other characters and areas in the game, it does leave a tiny more to be desired. Otherwise the lore of stardew, and the characters, and the whole place definitely feels pretty magical.

GAMEPLAY: 9/10
Gameplay is pretty simple and easy to get the hang of. You can roll your hotbar with your mouse, swing with a click, move with your wasd keys, and Useful tip: can turn on (show hit square) so you can see where you're aiming when you're farming (mostly for farming). Sometimes I feel like combat is a little clunky but its not by any means bad in terms of hit boxes or even enemy scaling. Food serves as both energy and health items so you can use it for both when in the mines as you fight enemies and swing your pickaxe.

GRAPHICS: 8.5/10
Graphic wise the game is polished, and charming, but as a top down, it's not super detailed. There is a lot of detail in everything, graphics included, but obviously there are limits to pixelated sprite work. As far as pixel art goes, it's definitely pretty top notch and expressive. I never feel like it ever looks ugly or off putting. I can easily be immersed in the world and my gaming session and have yet to run into anything I would say puts me off about any of the sprites, texture work, or overall graphics.

SOUND/MUSIC: 9/10
The sounds for everything is pleasant. I haven't come across any jarring sounds, and the collecting items and pulling up crops is satisfying to the ears. The music is great. It always feels like I can never get enough of them sometimes though. For example, you only get some music some places, and that means if I wanna hear that really cool cave song, I have to be mining in the cave, and then be lucky enough to hear it. Some of the seasons songs are really lovely though, namely some of the tunes in fall and winter have to be some of my favorite. Every song might not be a banger, but it has enough bangers throughout the entire ost that it makes up for that. Plus, maybe a different song does it more for you, but if I had to pick my favorite 3 songs, they would be Mines (A Visitor To The Unkown), Fall (The Smell Of Mushrooms) WInter (The Wind Can Be Still). There are more I really like, but i'll leave it at those.

REPLAYABILITY: 8.5/10
So far, can honestly say after how many times I/we have restarted runs and play throughs, it has only gotten more fun and enjoyable as I have a better idea of how much I can do with my time, and how to efficiently schedule my days. If I can edit my review, I may update this to a higher score later. I already feel like it will be a mainstay in my collection of games to play even if it's more like Minecraft where I drop it for a while, and then come back and binge it again, like rewatching a movie you love but haven't watched in a while.

All in all, pretty damn amazing it was made by one guy. Hope this helped you decide whether or not Stardew is right up your Valley. Cheers."

27501,"This game is amazing, its made by one dude and its better than a lot of AAA games. Its basically a chill game that you can mess around in. However, for me it got a bit repetitive, like I was grinding for things to grind faster with and dialogue options became a bit stale, but if you are a person who wants the game because of its farm mechanics then that wont be a problem for you"

27507,I like the individual story lines for each character; being able to be in the scenes is cool too. The game is complex & challenging. It's one of those games that I'm never bored. There's so much to do & you can't beat it in a few days. The wiki is a life saver. Try it before you think it's not for you. It's addicting.

27523,
27524,Cool
27525,I haven't played Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing so I can't speak to similarities/differences.  But I love the basic game play loop which eventually builds on itself.  You can keep watering/harvesting by hand or upgrade to automate these to focus on other tasks.  The developer continues to update and provide new things to do.  I have spent a good chunk of time playing this and I have loved the time I have spent.  And I plan to continue spending time in this

27545,best game ever
27546,"I've played a lot of harvest moon type games, but this one REALLY stands out because of how all-encompasing it is. Want a dungeon crawl? Stardew Valley has one. Mining game? There's some of that to be done for sure. Talk to people and form virtual bonds? This is the right game. Events (random chance or triggered), crazy funky animals, automation, farming, a heartwarming story, a ""bad end"" (Screw joja), a villain (Screw joja again), hidden characters (Check the sewers if you haven't already!), over a dozen easily available characters with interesting stories and genuine flaws that serve to make them better instead of grating.. Stardew Valley somehow has ALL of this at once, and oh BOY if you're an easter egg hunter I don't think you'll ever run out of little things to notice. This whole game has been crafted with such amazing love and genuine passion and it shows that in every inch of it. If you think this is just a farming game, you're wrong. I think you can actually progress to the end of basically everything except the farm evaluation thing (vague for spoilers) WITHOUT planting a single crop. You could befriend the entire town, fish for a living, mine for a living, do requests for a living, forage random things from the wild for a living... This game isn't a farming sim, it's a game of it's own class."
27547,this game is too good puts a lot of triple A games to shame. love this so much it. worth whatever you can get it at free $15.00  $30.00 $50.00 its for sure worth it.

27558,"Very fun but eventually will get repetitive. Like you get a routine. Feed the animals, water the plant, and then whatever you want to do for the day and that's it. It's really good at the start but it will get kind of repetitive. Other than that a great fantastic game that's worth the value. One solution for the main issue I have is just play multiplayer."

27576,What a fun game. I've enjoyed it very much. Very simple game with loads of contents.
27577,"A farming/dating sim seems to be a good mix since this game is great. A big world, many different characters, great graphics, nice quests and introduction and even a cave where you can fight yourself to the lowest level. This game is has it all and is doing it great. And it's all packed in a pixel style."

 [*]Has a perfect balance between what one can accomplish in a day and the routines that one needs to go through every day
 [*]The amount of hours one can spend in the game is immense just due to the pace of the game and the depth of every detail and section

27605,this game makes me cream. 10/10 would recommend
27606,Penny=best girl
27607,"This is the kind of game where you can either turn your brain off and enjoy the pixel art, great soundtrack, and decent game mechanics OR you can constantly check the wiki to make sure you're playing ""optimally"". I endorse both approaches."
27608,blue berries
27609,great game
27610,"[h1]♥ This Game[/h1]

This game is a relaxing little thing you can play as a stress reliever, & the type of game you can easily play even when tired. Children to elders can enjoy this game since the controls are easy & has different activites for different interests

I haven't played solo yet, since I've had friends to play with & I can't imagine enjoying solo more than with friends, but I'm sure it's still enjoyable. Each of my farms are different & earn game currency differently & I like the flexibility of that. Grinding for upgrades on the farm takes a little while, but it isn't stressful or irritating. Farming with a friend makes it easier & quicker, I think

I love pixel art styles, & the usage of it in this game is beautiful & easy on the eyes, the animals are so cute! 

The only things I think bother me, are; 

★ [b]The colour options[/b] (especially for the hair) when you make a character, it's not easy to have light or pastel colours (light blonde or pink for example) for the hair without it looking greyish or dull. I think that could be fixed if we got to colour pick for the highlighting & shading for the hair as well, & not just 1 shade for the whole hair. 

★ [b]Have more things to do with the pet.[/b] We can only pet it & give it water. It would be nice if it did things for us, like hunt & bring back things. Also if we could give it food & treats that maybe boost the activities it can do. Getting pet furniture would also be nice

(つ˵•́ ヮ•̀˵)つ━☆ﾟ.*･｡ Also, [b]Sam [i]is[/i] best boy[/b] ♥ *: ･ﾟ"
27611,yes harem
27612,"Tricks you into thinking it's a simple farming game, but once you get your relationship with other characters up, things really pick up. Don't forget to go mining!"
27613,shane good boi marry shane do it
27614,Its very relaxing. I havent got far yet but I see myself playing this constantly
27615,Finally a relaxing game to play.

27620,"This game is a work of art. Done, nothing else to say about it."

27630,haha farming sim games go weeeee
27631,probably a good game but i just find it boring and grindy and i dont even know what i am working towards
27632,I'm now on my second play through of the game and it just keeps getting better and better! If you're on the fence about this game I can't recommend it enough - highly addictive and one of the best games out there in my opinion.
27633,One of my favorite games!

27641,Stardew Valley is a CHUNGUS game.
27642,"With 266 hours on hand, it's safe to say I love this game. I'm not going to lie, it starts off a little slow if you aren't sure what you're doing yet but it's well worth the game play. I started a a save to play with my best friend when COVID first started so that we would have something to do and I ended up beating the game without him then having to start a new world lol. So much fun and the pixel world is so cute, you won't be able to get enough. Highly recommend playing with a friend or two to make it even better."
27643,yes
27644,Relaxing nd simple on the surface but can be a very challenging this game is amazing.
27645,"fuck u hailey
"
27646,Fun game
27647,"While the game is not perfect, it's still a good game. If you like chill gameplay, this game is for you. 

Plus the fact that the dev is still improving the game after many years from its release."
27648,made me forget about my depression
27649,"I am addicted to this game, I have bought it on every other platform I have and now I can enjoy it on pc. 9/10 because I can't live in the game"
27650,seru buat main santai.. tapi disayangkan ga bisa save dimanapun. harus berganti hari baru bisa save
27651,Its fab xx
27652,I like farm :)
27653,"Okay so, This game is pretty good to my girlfriend at least. I get pretty bored, pretty fast but that's just me. MY ISSUE WITH THIS GAME IS: THE COLORS.
I know. That is a stupid complaint. But this game literally gives me headaches because of the harsh colors. If you get headaches from bright lights/colors like me, don't buy this UNLESS YOU ARE GONNA MOD IT. It literally sucks to play with a headache."
27654,sick
27655,eh
27656,Time Sink
27657,Fun times with friend. Very chill game. Fishing is probably my favorite part.
27658,i am gay for every single romance-able character

27660,Farm and live simple life. 10/10
27661,cute

27678,"Its so easy to play for hours. If you like minecraft, you'll like this too."
27679,its perfect
27680,Super fun and easy to replay over and over. Queer friendly!
27681,This is honestly my favourite game ever. It can be a little overwhelming to start. I highly recommend having a save file with friend when starting out so you can practice as well as it's a lot of fun. But overall it's a very chill game where you can go at your own pace. There's so much to do that it seems like the game never ends.
27682,this game is so goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
27683,i freaking LOVE this game. Very nice farming sim to pass the time and great to play with friends
27684,"I couldn't fight Shane, and it won't let me grave rob. 5/10. Would be improved with homicide and theft addition. That would increase score to 9/10. Add anime women, and it becomes a 10/10."

27729,can sex sex hot men
27730,I play this while I sit in queue for league of legends. Helps me calm down and relax! 10/10 would recommend.
27731,"Phenomenal game, nothing can replace the feeling of just finding things out and learning the games mechanics as you grow,
cherish the time you have as a new player because nothing can make that happen again, this game does that incredibly"

27736,"i love this game so much. you can farm, mine, fish and more, while romancing the towns people. I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT (except pierre, demetrius and mayor lewis but that's it)."
27737,"The only thing you'll regret is that you waited this long to buy it. The game is great, just great. Beautiful scenery and relaxing gameplay. Also, this game has been great for me to start unwinding in the evenings instead of fast-paces games that gets me rallied up. Buy it now!"
27738,farming
27739,It's so fun to play this with friends. It's a nice relaxing time for everyone!
27740,nice game
27741,good
27742,Its great
27743,Nice chill game to play when sad and depressed 👍
27744,I can fix Shane
27745,"If you ever wanted to be a farmer, or you never knew you wanted to be one, well let me reassure you that this is the game for you. This will have you living on your dream farm outside of the city life. Living alongside various townsfolk, with very interesting personalities to say the least, and Linus the trash eating sweetheart. Take part in many Festive activities throughout the seasons, go mining, ride horses? oh BABY! As you can see there are many things to do in Stardew Valley, BUT WAIT! I'm not done yet... Save the community center from the evil antagonist, Joja. Yes this game has a villain, which gives you anime enthusiasts more the reason to be the hero of this peaceful, somewhat wacky, RPG. Complete tasks... ""AMOGUS?"" ""Shut up cringelord"" This is Stardew Valley. As i was saying complete tasks, and save your local community center and become the ""Ultimate Farmer"" of 2016's smash hit Stardew Valley Today. #AD (not really). P.S 69 hours EX-DEE"
27746,"With over 300 hrs of game play I can say, this game can really sink you into completing a given task. Whether its the community centre, marrying your favourite npc etc. The way I like to describe this game as a ""perfect game for mild hoarders"" as you will be saving most of what you gather from mid game on wards. All jokes aside, this game is really fun and there is a ton to do."
27747,farmville but cool
27748,yeah it's alright
27749,"This game is beautiful, wholesome, and just great. I love the original gameplay, but modding capabilities for this game is awesome. HIGHLY recommended."
27750,"good game
"
27751,one of the best inde games of all time worth every dollar
27752,"It's a very nice game, lots of fun."
27753,its fun and addicting
27754,My new obsession. The best game for neurodivergents. It's just the best.

27757,It good.
27758,eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
27759,"Very good game. I find myself stuck to my computer for up to 18 hours a day. Extremely addictive; highly recommend. Also, the music is amazing."
27760,SUCH A FUN GAME I SQUEAKED WHEN MY NPC CRUSH KISSED ME IMH
27761,Very good game
27762,"Such a fun and relaxing game. Super fun to play alone as well as co-op. Word of advice don't marry Shane he's messy!!!! Probably one of my favourite games, you never get tired of the grind, the cut-scenes are just too good, it's so much more than just a farming game, can't wait for the haunted chocolatier game this game is so addicting and satisfying.  Dedicated to 100% this game.

Love it :)"
27763,Love this game! It is relaxing and very addictive. Endless gaming time.
27764,Stardew Valley is a great game and one of the best Indie titles I've ever played. Great gameplay and even better characters. 8.8/10.
27765,so great with cheats
27766,"Really calming and great multiplayer game, safe to mod and overall a very wholesome game!"
27767,:)
27768,:)
27769,Its calm and peaceful better modded
27770,Farming and making up for my lack of romantic attention from my crush? HELL YES!!!
27771,Fishing
27772,"I love almost everything about this game. The gameplay loop is satisfying, the visuals are beautiful, and there's endless things to do. I could go on and on about everything perfect about this game, so I'll just say my one negative.

Interaction with the villagers is really dull. After talking to people a few times, you'll begin to realise how lifeless they feel. Repeating the same lines every day, even after knowing them for years. The cutscenes you get with them all are charming, but to reach them, you just give them gifts every single week, over and over. Really though, its not a deal breaker in the slightest. I went into the game normally loving the social aspects of games, and now I love exploring and grinding to make the best farm I can! The fact that a single person made this game is astounding to me. Stop looking for a reason not to buy it, and get it."
27773,its a great calm relaxing game
27774,fun
27775,gREAT GAME
27776,A true successor from harvest moon game. There is nothing to pressure your farm here and you can grow it at your own pace.
27777,Very addictive and has interesting background stories.
27778,When are we getting the Kill Pierre DLC?
27779,Great game :)
27780,Yes
27781,its alright i guess
27782,i like it
27783,"Beautiful, wonderful, extraordinary, realistic, retro, countless words I give it, but none compare to the amazement it leaves me with. Such an extraordinary game. Definitely worth every single shot."
27784,TBH Dark Souls 2 is a way better experience.
27785,Calming and relaxing.
27786,the best dating simulator
27787,GG
27788,its a great game i would recommend everyone to plays this
27789,A great game to play alone or with friends just challengeing enough
27790,game take away sad. get stonks.
27791,It is a lot of fun. Very addicting. :) And it is great way to pass time while listening to audiobooks or when the work day is slow.
27792,I love this game in it's entirety. I even enjoy the horrible fishing mechanics.
27793,"Can have a harem of men and women while tending to your chicken named ""Cow."" 10/10"
27794,Masterpiece.
27795,SO GOOD. YES. AMAZING.
27796,"It is okay. It could use more content and more variation/ randomization options. Characters could due with some dialog variance as it gets repetitive fast when you're talking with them to raise friendship. Randomizing the liked, loved and hated gifts would offer replay-ability score. It is a solid game though. I've gotten my moneys worth for the playtime I've put in."
27797,"Stardew has been my favorite game for years. Calming, beautiful gameplay with a complex campaign."
27798,Play with friends
27799,Afun game you can play that is really relaxing.
27800,"farm
"
27801," ! WARNING ! 
THIS GAME IS SO GOOD IT CAN BE ADDICTIVE"
27802,kinda farming type shit
27803,nice lot to do
27804,Great relaxing game! love playing solo and with friends.
27805,"Very fun game, I enjoyed playing every moment of it. It felt surreal and I would definitely recommend this to new players."
27806,Very nice!
27807,We don't like you gus........... almost as much as I don't like joja mart.....
27808,love this game fr
27809,"Great game, well thought out. Similar to Animal crossing but made by one person, not hundreds. Plus co-op is actually possible. Well worth it."
27810,"Much Farm, So Cute, Much Wow."
27811,"Such a chill, relaxed game that has continued to surprise me with new things every time I play. Love!"
27812,CHAD PARSNIP FARMER
27813,"Low pressure, go at your own pace."
27814,Now this is a fun relaxing game that you can play for hours on end without getting bored. The core gameplay loop is really fun and it has so much content that it's extremely replayable. I've gone through I believe 5 or six different farms and played them to completion and I can say each experience felt different. The developer really cares about this game and is constantly adding bug fixes and thinking of new exciting content. I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy the slower more chilled out games.
27815,"What can I say about Stardew that hasn't already been said? I love that it is the work of one man's dream. I love that it is a game where you can be whatever you want to be. Yes, there are quests/objectives, but you don't have to complete them. If you want to mine, mine. If you want to farm, farm. If you want to fish, fish. If you want to decorate your farm, go for it. If you want to only push objectives, go for it. The whole premise of moving to a small town after leaving your corporate job is super relaxing for some reason, despite you still having to choose what you do day-to-day. I also love that the dialogue with the NPCs are relatable, and that you can set this game down for months at a time, but it's really easy to pick up where you left off....or just start over. Music is amazing, graphics are fun!"
27816,I liked this game
27817,"Its a good game, but the connection on co-op mode keeps on disconnecting regardless any internet provider me and ny friend use, the average internet speed is 35 Mbps, with abt 90 ping ,our connrction is enough to play a 4k video on youtube without any lag, but stardew valley keep on disconnecting, it could occur in every 10 mins of gamrplay, and its getting annoying"
27818,I don't think I'd ever get bored of this game. I have a real addiction.
27819,"simple farming, good character design, animals ... hat mouse !! 100/10"
27820,i love this game with all my heart i am in love with harvey and elliot and it has consumed my whole brain please i love it so much
27821,sweet
27822,"you farm, have animals, and can create meaningful relationships with the other villagers :)       it lets me live out my farmer/rancher/small town dreams :-)))))"
27823,"its so much fun, all the joy of progression on a farm in real life, just much faster and much easier, be warned lots of research can go into this so if you wanna play something mindless this might not be the one for you"
27824,"fun, kinda melts your brain"
27825,Aun me sigue sorprendiendo la cantidad de contenido que tiene este hermoso juego. Recomendadisimo :)
27826,Like Farmville but a million times better. It is the first PC game I have owned and now have over 100 hours of play time. Hats off to ConcernedApe!
27827,i. love. this. game.
27828,I played this game for 12 hours straight on a school night and passed out but it was all worth it to make Haley marry me #gay
27829,It's fun if you're a dedicated person willing to put the time in.
27830,IS GUD
27831,good
27832,I have never been more upset at a fictional corporation
27833,I don't need to tell you how cute this game is. You all know it's cute.
27834,i could be the popes cardinals only he would know
27835,SO FUN! This game has so much more to it than it looks like!
27836,everything is great
27837,"farm, feed, and fuck haley"
27838,"Had to make a review before hitting the 70 hrs mark, in short:

I really like this game, 
chill and fun to play by myself (ç_ç)


also i called my horse ""Car"""
27839,
27840,"11/10 would definitely buy it a fourth time.

Classic"
27841,calms you down from stress always.
27842,Its fun
27843,Amazing atmosphere!
27844,Chill game with fun characters and simple mechanics. Walks a fine line between punishing you when you mess up while still being easy
27845,"Very cutesy style game, lots of new things to do and discover! i recommend this game to people who like exploration games and pixel games and also people who just like to focus on the appearance of their farm!"
27846,very good
27847,"First time I bought it I didn't really like it. Im glad I did not know steam had the option to refund, so the game stayed for like 2 years on my account. Not a long time ago I decided to play it again and see if I'd like it or not, and man it's addicting. Just the idea of the game is really good and i've had a lotta fun playing it."
27848,Pretty much therapy if it was a video game
27849,"good
"
27850,yes
27851,a

27853,God i love this game so much
27854,"very bueno, mega pog"
27855,"I am sitting in a hotel room being anxious because I have quite a hard time at work and my apartment got flooded and it all comes together at a shitty moment. When i realized that Stardew Valley was also playable on my work laptop (mac) and not only on my gigafister 6000 PC that got trashed, I immediately got sucked in and it made me relax so easily. I recommend this game for anyone that needs to decelerate or likes to build a cute farm with challenges and lots of content all over the place. Don't play ""Journey Of The Prairie King"" though, it will raise your blood pressure ;)"
27856,"I absolutely love this game. It is my #1 favorite and has brought me so much happiness. Normally, when I'm upset I would play this game and it has never failed to make me happy. I highly suggest recommending this to friends!"
27857,Its good I guess
27858,sebastian best boi
27859,"This game is so fun, there's so much to do and it's incredibly engaging."
27860,much relaxing
27861,"I think i might be addicted... A lot of people think Stardew Valley is just a little farming game, BUT NO. HONEY, IT IS WAY MORE THAN THAT. You can farm, fish, mine, and much much more. There are also plenty of Easter eggs in this game which makes it a thousand times better. Did I also tell you that you can have a legit family in this game? Because y'all have never seen a woman in your life, so you better get this game :)"
27862,just perfect *chefs kiss*
27863,yes
27864,Farm
27865,Fun
27866,"farming simulator perfectly fused together with a community and relationship aspect. 10/10 i have over 200 hours in this game and I highly recommend it! If you have any questions on it, I'm more than happy to answer them!"
27867,"Wether it be the sprites, the story or the art  this game is beautifully done. The story line and the characters are very charming and makes you want to come back for more."
27868,Fun and calming games. Always can find new inspiration to get back into it.
27869,the game is simple with no win/lose. you just hang out and grow things.
27870,This is so much fun to play!
27871,"Easy, fun, good game to play"
27872,destroying trees is quite fun
27873,cool ig
27874,this game is perfect for depressed fruity people. i say this because me and my friends are depressed fruity people and loved it. 11/10
27875,"O Game é simples, mas te prende mto pra ficar jogando toda hora e deixar a tua fazenda o mais lindo possivel, eu sou uma pessoa que não enjoava de jogos muito rapido, mas esse game ta durando, e fazendo um bom papel quando o assunto é relaxar."
27876,best farming simulator
27877,yes
27878,Most relaxing game I have ever played.
27879,"very good at relieving stress, would very much recommend."
27880,"I don’t need therapy, I just need Stardew Valley"
27881,mmm monke
27882,"I love this game so much!!!
It's one of my most played games EVER, even tho I've only had it since August, so barely 7months ;O I got this as a gift from my friend and it was such a great gift <3 I knew I'll like this game, but I had no idea I'll LOVE IT so much :3

It's great for when I don't want to think too much, but also for when I want to plan things and do a lot. I can choose what to do and I have all the time in the world to do so! ^^

Do you like rich story and complex characters? You have a ton of it here!
Do you like combat? Go to the mines!
Do you like farming and taking care of pets? You have a farm!
Do you like gathering resources and picking up wild plants? The whole city and other places are perfect for you!
Do you like fishing? Honey, this game got you!
Do you like helping other people and doing quests? HELL YEAH!

It has so much, seriously. I'm on my 360h at the moment and I still have SO MUCH to discover <3
I totally recommend this game :)

Lil note:
Steam version has an issue with the community center achievement, but besides that I didn't have any bugs or issues :)
So the achievement was probably a Steam issue, not the game itself."
27883,good game
27884,"It is fun.
Trust me bro."
27885,Made an Auschwitz entirment camp as Erwin Rommel. Married some Blond girl with blue eyes. I recommend
27886,"Literally my favourite game, it ruined my life I went from very rarely playing video games to now spending like 6 hours every day growing my silly little farm"
27887,great game good if you like grinding over all 10/10
27888,Great timekiller!
27889,"back on the farm, no more nagging boss"
27890,cool game bro
27891,The best game in this style. I love Eric and his game so much. I usually play on iPad and my Android phone. But it's always shut down itself. This problem didn't occurs in steam version.
27892,YES.
27893,"100% one of the best games on steam, i could play this for hours on end!"
27894,Maple syrup and some crops-all that you need to be happy
27895,very fun game
27896,"This game has helped me through tough times. I'm sure it has for many people. This little farm game has so much more to it than what it presents itself to be on the store page. It has lore, it has great gameplay and even the NPCs are so interesting and especially fun to make fanart of. It is worth every coin I spent to get this game and I recommend it to anyone."
27897,i am gay with my lover
27898,"lameeee
"
27899,I thought it was just going to be an addictive farming game. Then an owl statue randomly appeared in my orchard
27900,Fun game with lots to do!
27901,gay
27902,Cute and relaxing farm simulator !
27903,Very fun relaxing game. If you like simple games like minecraft this one is worth giving a try
27904,Fun and relaxing
27905,"is great game
"
27906,My favorite game! I recommend it to anyone <3
27907,yes
27908,honestly one of my top 5 fave games. It's addictive and calming and so full of life. the community is great and super creative. I love adding mods and can't wait for his new game
27909,"I tried playing this game years ago, and stopped because I didn't want to put in the work to learn it. (Ignorant, I know). 

But about 3-4 days ago on a whim, I decided to reinstall it and give it an honest shot. ~50 Hours later, clearly, I have been non-stop playing since then. I truly don't know where the time goes because I'm so invested in the story and the gameplay. 
This is honestly one of the best games I have played in such a long time, I feel so refreshed, I only wish that I had picked it up sooner. It's super addicting, and so fun to play. 
I love the stories that were put into the characters around town, and their dialogue whenever you talk with them. I love that there isn't any rush to get tasks done, and you can go as slow, or as fast as you want to to complete objectives. (Besides tasks on the bulletin board, but you don't get punished for not completing those either).
The passion behind the player base of this game also convinced me, when I was being hard headed to try this again. Friends that I've known for years are still playing this game to this day.
Overall, I feel a lot of regret for not picking it up sooner. If you are a fan of Terraria, this is another must-try."
27910,it fun
27911,"GOOD GAME
"
27912,"Super fun game, feels like there's always something to do"
27913,"Great game, would recommend to anyone even thinking about it."
27914,Yup
27915,I like this game a lot. I love Harvest Moon and life sims
27916,this game keeps me mentally stable :D
27917,i have so much fun playing its has all the nice elements in a video game PLUS its storymode i love this game w all my heart
27918,vibe.
27919,good
27920,"This is for sure one of my favorite games and I haven't even got that far through it. The game has so many features including overrall skills to be learned/developed, NPC's that you can be platonically or romantically involved with, cutscenes, quests, crafts, and a lot more. The pixelated graphics of the whole thing makes it so cute and fun as well. To anyone who wants to try this game, I would fully recommend it and even if you are questioning it, I think it's still worth it to buy. AND if you are an animal crossing fan, this is so similar but in its own seperate/special way."
27921,cute farm sim make my brain happy
27922,i love this game
27923,Good game
27924,"Pros
-Relaxing
-Lots to discover and learn
-Not hardware intensive. You could run this on a potato for the true farming experience
-Large library of mods that are easy to install and use, and a detailed wiki
-Active community

Cons
-Really easy to get consumed by and sink way too much time into. Achievements are a grind."
27925,poggers.
27926,its pretty good
27927,"hot chicks (chicken)
"
27928,"I like it and its good to play with friends or a special someone, and if you like farming and building a love life in games this is also a good game for you."
27929,farm go brrrrrr
27930,gud
27931,"yes, im one of the people who sell stacks of 999 ancient fruit wine"
27932,"Good game, can sex the characters"
27933,I think this is a super fun game that allows you to play at your own pace. Friendly to new and old players alike and always keeping you on your toes
27934,stardew vally is a very good game because its full of tasks and strady thats why i recomend the game.

27940,arg i love this game w a burning passion
27941,Mental Health (+100)
27942,"Fell asleep in a dungeon at 2:00 a.m on accident while a bunch of slimes surrounded me. Woke up in Bed back at my house with a note that said someone climbed 45 levels down into an old abandoned mineshaft, slaughtered all the slimes dancing on my unconcious body, then proceed to one arm fireman carry me back up the ladder 45 levels to the surface and all the way back home before dawn but then claimed someone ""was rifleing through my pockets"" Next thing I know, I have 20 cauliflower seeds and a bunch of other stuff missing. 

10/10 Not actually a farming simulator surprisingly"

27950,cool farmer fish game check it out
27951,"I've been playing this game for a while, even in-between breaks i can't stay away from it. It has something so personal, and original to it, and i'm not sure how to better describe it other than well thought out, and well put together. 
After buying this not only my PC, but also the switch, I've been playing in-between both platforms, and just love every moment of it.

10/10 would recommend for anyone wanting something laid back and relaxing!"
27952,Like to relax while playing this game. Very nice

27959,good
27960,gudder
27961,"I have played over 500 hours of this game on multiple different platforms. I love playing it on PC because it's so easy to mod it. If you need any ideas on modding, definitely look into Stardew Valley Expanded & Ridgeside Village. Two of the biggest mods that add characters and stories. I've finally hit my limit on this game, but we'll see how long that lasts before I'm playing again."
27962,it's a good game
27963,215 hours played and still not bored of it. One of the best games ever made.
27964,"It's just an overall good game

27968,"This will forever be one of my favorite games! I play it on both PC and Switch. It's so cute, and I have never run out of stuff to do. I love all the details and the music! I highly recommend!"
27969,idk lol
27970,KJSDHKJSDHKJSHDkj
27971,One of the most addicting games
27972,"This game is very enjoyable for me and my friends! I would defiantly recommend, its just the co op feature is a little buggy in my experience."

27974,"Please dont make me type, steam, Thoughts are hard, stardew is good
"

27976,"this is my comfort game and has saved me countless times, and i finally got it on my computer too. this game is absolutely incredible, the storyline is beautiful, and has had me in tears a few times. if youre considering getting this game, just do it. trust me you wont regret it"
27977,Muy chido q bn
27978,"If you like farming sim games and dating sims, this is a perfect game. It's very easy to spend hours customizing your farm but it's worth it."

27986,"I love this game. relaxed vibe, takes a long while to progress though. would like more dlc content, more added on items/places/perks."
27987,hype
27988,"A wonderful game that is very calming.  I was recently in two car accidents and had to move away for neurological therapy, meaning I am no longer able to hang out with my friends or boyfriend.  Stardew Valley allows me to play with them and enjoy their various antics.  Ikaika, if you're reading this, I love you and I always appreciate how you take care of the animals.  I'm gonna marry you someday, I promise (just as soon as I get a prismatic shard)!"

27999,"This game is amazing! Satisfies both creativity and strategy. I've put in almost 100 hours into this game alone and will never get tired of it. Plus, the story is very cute! The game is very colorful and the gameplay controls are simple and easy to get used to. Overall I give this wonderful game 5 stars!"

28001,w
28002,its adorable and the characters are cool
28003,"amazing game, i could play for hrs"
28004,Favourite game.
28005,i love stardew!!! you should buy it...
28006,nice
28007,This is one of the best games i have ever played. There is just so much things to do! 9/10
28008,Da bees knees!
28009,"This review will surely get lost in the sea of the literal hundreds of thousands of reviews for this game, but this game is so amazing it deserves a few moments of my time to write something about it. I got this game as soon as it came out my senior year in college and was instantly addicted. 5 years later I'm still playing, and I don't think that'll change anytime soon.

This is the best farming game ever made by a huge margin. If this game is a 10/10 (which it is) the next best possible farming game can, at BEST, score an 8/10. But I'll take it a step further: this is one of the best video games ever made. This game is transcendental. This is the sort of game people tell all their friends about, the kind of game parents can't wait for their kids to get old enough so they can boot it up for them for a co-op run to get them into video games. People will be playing this game for a long, long, LONG time. 

This is a game I'm going to come back to every year or two for the rest of my life."
28010,One of the best games I've played in my life. So much to do in the game!! Highly recommend.
28011,"wow
"
28012,<3
28013,A perfect game. The only problem with it is that it's possibly too addictive.
28014,"even if you dont like farming this game is still pretty fun so make sure to give it a try. it doesnt have very demanding minimum requirements, and if you really struggle running this version there is an official mobile phone version."
28015,who needs a wife when you can live out your lifelong dreams tending to a fake farm with an e-wife? this is much easier
28016,"love the valley i love the valley so much. i wake up and think about the valley, i go to sleep and dream of the valley. i have never loved anything more than i have loved the valley. i would sell my firstborn for the valley. i have played 36hours in the last week i am going to die happy knowing i played stardew valley."
28017,Very fun and relaxing game
28018,epic
28019,"Don't read the wiki, you'll be trapped in an infinite loop of trying to min-max the game.
if you want to play casually, just don't read the wiki and discover shit yourself. loads of fun tho!
Omw to skull cavern again, bye."
28020,Yes
28021,"sick game
"
28022,Wholesome
28023,"i highly recommend this game to others, very fun co op game to play with friends!"

28036,"grass or stardew ,choose."
28037,Yes
28038,yes
28039,"A fantastically written RPG in the skin of a farming game. It's pretty much everything good about indie games in a neat bow, and the modding community has *very* few peers."
28040,All I can say is Oh My Gosh this game is absolutely insane it's been less then three days since I got it and I've already put in over ten hours. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing farming games.
28041,"I grew up playing Harvest Moon- and had been dying for a new Harvest Moon. Stardew Valley scratched that itch for me in the best of ways. This game has brought me (including my play time on the Switch) well over 1,000 hours of entertainment. With the addition of multiplayer, my boyfriend and I have made it a frequest routine for us to work on our farm together. With the multiple play style options- he can do the dungeon delving, fishing that he loves- and I can do the crop management and farm design that I enjoy the most."
28042,I like to get really high and fish.
28043,Yes. Absolutely Yes. One of my favorite games to get lost in. The relaxation from this game gives the ultimate chill vibes. So much fun to lay back in bed with my controller and play on my PC. I bought this game on my switch too for on the go play. Best Game Ever.
28044,eh
28045,Cute
28046,Its almost like Secret of Mana and Animal Crossing had a baby. Good fun.
28047,"I love this game, it has very relaxing gameplay, and it's a very fun and cute game in general... Farming, fishing, mining, interacting with NPC's... Reminds me a bit of Terraria for some reason.

I would strongly recommend, it's worth it's full price."
28048,fun and soothing
28049,"yea its very good

id play it"
28050,its very cool its like a good game if you want it you should get it
28051,yyyyy
28052,"Yeah
"
28053,I love this game and it is so addicting
28054,Such a fun and relaxing game. Super fun to play alone as well as co-op. Incredibly impressive
28055,Yes
28056,I'd get on my knees for this game I am so in love with it
28057,"its amazing
"
28058,"Possibly the best farming sim game out there. Live out your wildest dreams, such as owning a house and being financially stable, all while being romantically involved with about half the local townsfolk!"
28059,"Super cute, fun game. A lot to do. Feels like a harvest moon type game which I absolutely love. You can fish, farm, mine, do quests, there is story lines to follow and have fun with!"
28060,"vry good, modded is great if u get bored of the repetetive nature !"
28061,"Stardew Valley is something really special. I have been playing this game on different platforms since 2016, dozens of save files all with unique farms, I've grown attached to the NPCs, not once disappointed with anything in the game. The developer is quick to fix bugs and new content is added frequently. The community for this game is amazing. There are hundreds of fan-made mods that improve, redesign, and extend the game (and some even have their *own* sub-communities.) I have met years-long friends in co-op games. There are plot objectives but really no wrong way to play; you can choose to spend all your time fishing, or fighting monsters in the mines, or romancing bachelors, and still enjoy the full game."
28062,cured my crippling depression.
28063,best game i've ever played 10/10 -a sam simp
28064,"This game continues to be an absolute delight even after years of off and on playing across multiple platforms. I'm currently playing vanilla SDV on Switch and using PC to load up with mods for a more expanded experience. 10/10, led me to make some amazing friends throughout the years, who knew farming could be so dang fun."
28065,"Modern harvest moon with a lot of personality and lovable characters. It gets better and better every update and patch, easily top 5 game ever. If you liked harvest moon you'll love Stardew"
28066,nivr game
28067,"Seriously one of the most incredible games I've ever played. The mechanics aren't the standout, but instead it's the potential. Once you play the game for a while you notice a couple wants or desires that will never be filled, a cuter house, perhaps. However, there are literal thousands of mods, both aesthetic and functional, breaking the limits of Stardew and expanding it's potential to the horizon and beyond. If you seriously enjoy building up your wealth, developing a farming system that works for you, or meticulously decorating an expansive land, this is the game for you."
28068,"Its not just your regular farming sim, the cast of NPCS is rlly good 10/10"
28069,I literally love this game the characters grow things chance sometimes things go bad but everything is alright in the end. i love the farming the grinding the characters. i always come back to this game eventually because its just worth it i highly recommend it to everyone i know
28070,good

28092,"I once went to an animal shelter because of my friend from the Netherlands, and one of the ducks pooped on me. The home trip was horrible because everywhere I would go I would smell nothing but myself - That's how I imagine the player character to be in Stardew Valley. And since it was such a gut wrenching and horrible experience to have together with my wife and children with everyone looking at me with raised eyebrows, pointing and laughing at me like the time I worked for the circus in the freak show. That reminds me of when i stepped in one of the circus elephant's poo, and the way home was (likewise with the duck), horrible. 
(Thank god my poor mother wasn't there otherwise she would have to shoulder the burden). 
Even though I haven't unlocked poop yet in Stardew Valley, I fear for when the day comes, that my cows, ducks, goats and pigs will lay down hell in front of my front door and make me smell so horribly no shower can ever correct it.
A truly horrifying experience."

28103,"Farm yes
"
28104,"Great Dev. Great game.

10/10"
28105,"I downloaded Steam just so I could play this game. 

It's been three years and I have absolutely no regrets. I love the world and all of the quests. I love that there's no sense of urgency to complete things; you play at your own pace and enjoy it however you want. I don't love farming, so on my second play I did the bare minimum I needed to do on the farm, and instead, I did a lot of mining and fishing and my game didn't suffer at all because there are so many different ways to grow your farm and your character.

If you want a casual game that you can play a million different ways and always find something new, then this is the game for you!"
28106,"Stardew Valley has become one of my all time favorite games. Both single player and co-op offer such different but enjoyable play styles, and the variety of starts and options right out the gate and focuses are top notch!
 It's definitely slower paced than some games of this type and genre, but to me that is to its benefit! I enjoy games that allow me to learn slowly if need be, rather than constantly throwing me in the deep end because of accidentally missing an early line or clue. The game also offers ways to explore it in full even if you didn't at first pick a route that seems like it would let you. It doesn't punish you for the paths you've chosen, and can later on down the line offer ways to get items you otherwise might have been blocked from.

 This is barely touching on the co-op, which in many games can be a hassle, this game does wonderfully with the options of how you and your friends want to go about playing. Joint money making or not, where you live on the farm, and opening up areas of the game either through having one person focus on one job or task, or going around in groups to complete the quests or challenges!

 All in all, Stardew Valley is a game I can pick up any time, and it's incredibly enjoyable to grow a farm and whatever it is you want to do with said farm! Become a monster slayer? Sure. Exclusively farm fruit trees and tappers? You can do that (albeit it's a challenge for some areas XD). Have animals and eventually do nothing but care for them? Stardew Valley lets you do that.
 I recommend you give it a try, it certainly isn't for everyone with the pacing it has, but even so I'd say give it a try. See how your first year goes, there's always something new to find and explore in the game!"
28107,rather enjoyable
28108,"good game
"
28109,124 hours in and I still can't get enough. I think I'll be playing Stardew Valley until the day I die.
28110,Stardew Valley has everything you need to fulfill your dreams of escaping the meaningless grind of life and enjoy what really matters: hitting on all the hot babes in town! Nah but for real this game is amazing.  So simple yet so elegant! Endless amounts of fun!
28111,Nice Cock 10/10
28112,It made my valley dewy.
28113,Fantastic game. Sunk roughly 100 hours into it and could probably play another 30-40 just to explore deeper. Lots to do and one of the most relaxing games I have ever played. It was great during lockdowns.
28114,"Capitalism has its grip on me and my only solace is this silly little game

28133,Oddly Stressing
28134,This game is really fun to play by your self or with others .I sugest it to people who love farming games.
28135,"Starts out well. seems to have a pretty good story line. Fishing mechanics completely blow and is more frustrating than it is worth, A real game killer. Miss watering your plants once and the crop is completely lost, Waste of good money."
28136,its so addicting
28137,"If you like lowkey storytelling, character development, dating as many people as you can at the same time and the occasional 500 hours of farming, then yes i recommend this cute-ass indie game."
28138,"Very Fun Very Relaxing, Very good modding community if not a bit horny. Any problems with the game probably has a mod that fixes it. Even with that said this game is very polished Very good. :)"
28139,Can't marry Evelyn
28140,This game is a classic! A must-have for any farmer simulator/RPG fans. Its wholesome and great for the whole family. I started while pregnant (found this game during lockdown) and now my 18 month old hops in my lap everytime the loading screen is on. Would recommend it again and again. (and I do!) I just love the simplicity and classic aesthetic.

Also, highly re-playable even without mods but the mods are fun too!"

This game is much more than just farming.  The story is awesome, the characters, the music, the design is all exceptional. 

Very relaxing game (unless you get involved with speedrunning). I have currently played around 250 hours and still haven't completed the entire game (true perfection).  Highly recommended game! 

Thank you, Concerned Ape, for your wonderful work."

28181,"Such a cute game to pass time with! I personally modded it but only recently, without mods it's still fantastic! Especially the day to day farm routine, it's monotonous between chasing lovers and getting cash but it's so rewarding. Ranching especially gets rewarding, as you get a better bond with your animals and thus get more rewards from the bond! The money saving is hard, that's my one negative, but it just means to stop being hesitant to sell things daily and stop buying things. Oh, and it's great on mobile, too, just a great transition from platforms!"
28182,"really fun and the characters are so cute
"
28183,"gud game

28184,Yes
28185,I really enjoy playing stardew valley even after 275 hours played there's a surprising amount of content for such a simple game. It's so satisfying building and designing your farm on your way to reaching an endgame farm.  Lots of Mods to enhance your playing experience make the game even more enjoyable. The pixel graphics and Music make it feel retro. I give this game a 10/10 well done ConcernedApe!
28186,"Stardew Valley
---------------
This Game is a MASTERPIECE, without a doubt, its perfect for what it goes for, simple in almost every way, but doesn't lack story or Gameplay. there is always going to be something to do and that's a great thing!

This Game may not be for everyone and i get that, its a farming game for goodness sake, but for what they do, they nail it as if they hit 10 bullseyes right in top of each other. 

This game has quite a lot to offer, from farming and making money, to marrying and co-op online. it covers almost everything to be a ""good"" game in general and that's amazing despite on how it started so small. the game has seen many improvements and is still being worked on by the same man until this very say in 2022.

CUSTOMIZATION
------------------
This game has quite a few Customization options.
Not quite as much as the dark souls or the new Elden Rings which im hoping on picking up soon here, but besides that, this game has enough customization options to let you have your own way of how you want your character to look!
it goes from:
Skin: 24
Hair: 73
Shirts: 112
Pants: 4
Gender: 2 (duh)
Accessories: 20
Color (Eyes, Hair, And Pants): all sections have a color bar that goes up to 99, showing the full spectrum of colors.
 You can also count about 6 pets in the mix if you really want to. Now as you can tell thats a lot of customization. but if you really wanna be crazy then go for the random button at the top left of the character customization screen.

Graphics?
-------------
Now lets take this for consideration. graphics in general should be the last of Your concern, and that also goes for Me, but I do have to say the graphics for this aren't the best for sure, but they sure do go well for the style, it stays to the art style and it looks good, like any other Pixelated Games.
 And that's also what i like about Pixelated Games, the Creators focus on fun more than anything else graphics wise and that's good. but keep in mind its always a warm welcome to have improved graphics come in (except for the gosh darn 3) but besides that, its all good.

Now Stardew takes place in a somewhat Third-Person camera view, while the game represents  you in 2nd view (word wise ofc), that's off topic though.
The world is 8-bit and so is everything else. good to know it stays like that LOL.

now the pixel art is most definetily well done and i give them props for that, it took me an hour to replicate one of those slimes, but its probably because i suck at pixel art :p.

Bugs and problems?
----------------------
Any game will have a few bugs, just because its good wouldnt prevent bugs.  But we will see what stardew has to offer when it has to do with bugs.
Some Bugs and Glitches may cause interesting things to happen, some good, and some others mildly annoying, may even be confusing to the player.

Anyways, regarding those, the animations and objects may and will clip into each other but its not game breaking since its a simple Game so it doesn't do much to your Game, now yes Trees don't have collision with the Hills it falls on, not allowing you to get the resources that fall on the Hills, which is mildly annoying.

Now Glitches like speeding up Slime spawning would be useful for farming Slime's in the slime hutch. and the High Quality Fertilizer glitch, which exploits Pierre's Fertilizers, in the 15th of spring.

There's many glitches but I don't want to have to cover them all, all you need to know is that this Game has Glitches too which should be obvious to You by now.

Gameplay
-----------------
Gameplay is pretty solid, and so is the story, but I will not be discussing the story to not spoil the interesting details about it.
Gameplay is simple but has a lot to do. Here's a List to see all the options.

Things to do:
Quests/Special Orders
Helping Jojo mart
Getting back the Community Center
Build Relationships
Farm
Fish
Mine
Scavenging/Foraging
Lumberjacking
Make a barn
Fight monsters
Sell things as well as buy
Adventurers Guild
Upgrade your house and play with Friends
Marry and have a family
Go on Festivals and Events
Discover and adventure
And more that i may not be aware of.

As you can tell there is a LOT to do, not as much as a game like Minecraft. but still has a plethora of options to go for. There are multiple areas you can discover or set as your farm land, like the four corners map, just meant for a group.

CONCLUSION
-------------------
overall this Game rocks for what it is and I would give it a 10/10 for its worth, price, fun, long lasting Gameplay and story, and everything else. It amazes me how well thought out Games can be by just one dude. The Gameplay is perfect for the Genre of Game it belongs in and it stands out well in the crowd. possibly on the very top of the Iceberg.
If you have the time and money to play this game i 100% recommend it to anyone who loves the relaxation and fun with friends and family.

This was my review, thank you for reading, if you decide to get the game, have fun!

28187,"I love stardew. ConcernedApe made a perfect game; great for co-op, equally great solo, a lot of collaboration is possible, but not necessary to enjoy the game. Calming vibes, while also having quirky, fun themes. Can't wait for him to publish his next one."
28188,Beautiful graphic thats all words i can say becasue i can't find any becaseu this game too cool.
28189, cum cum cum cum cum :D
28190,"Amazing game, fun to play with lots to do. This game can be played for hours on end for a day at a time (in-game), which makes it perfect for people who don't have that much time. Stardew Valley itself is well-crafted and you can tell how much time and effort the developer put into this based on the level of detail and amount of things there is to do in this game. Every achievement is meaningful and decisions that are made can be changed down the line one way or another, if not through a new save file. Love this game, 10/10"
28191,"love this game, concerned ape is awesome!"
28192,Cute! Play it!

28197,This is one of my all time favorite games. It's very relaxing and there's always something to do.
28198,Obviously an awesome game. One of the first games I've really gotten into in years.
28199,"Genuinely one of the best games I've ever played. Reminiscent of the old farming sim titles I played growing up in the best ways, while bringing something new and improving on the genre as well. Very relaxing and flexible enough that you can approach it super methodically or more lax depending on your play style and preference. Incredibly charming game and world created here with an immense amount of things to do and pursue, inhabited by fairly nuanced characters, with writing that manages to not shy away from negative aspects of human experience while still retaining an overall sense of hope and joy. I've never felt better about a game purchase with regards to both my play experience as well as the type of creator behind the game. The free updates that improved the game immensely and the consistent communication about bug fixes and patches really earned my confidence in ConcernedApe. I would absolutely buy this game again if I could; it has frequently been a safe haven of harmless fun and joy in my life."
28200,It is just a very addicting game once you have some knowledge about it and it helps you slow down
28201,"co-op ends in two ways only either ""we got every thing possible"" or ""WHY DID YOU SPEND 12 Mil ON STARFRUIT SEEDS NOW I CANT BUY MY HOUSE UPGRADE"" or something along those lines"

28205,"This game, and ConcernedApe, are brilliant.  I tried it a few times and couldn't get into it--I promise you, just keep plugging through the first two seasons, and you'll be hooked.  Everyone else has already complimented this to death, but it's still worth saying.  The mechanics all work wonderfully together, the bundles and collecting are such great ways to teach you the game's mechanics, and the music and graphics make the entire package very charming.  It's 2022, this game from 2016 looks like it came from 1992, and it's still amazing."

28215,"Only thought I would touch it 3-4 times. Turns out this is my new coping mechanism, all the bachelors/bachelorettes are great (<3 Shane/Haley/Elliott)"
28216,"To be honest i really enjoyed this game because for example when you have nothing to do or just bored play this lovely game to make that emotion go, it also helps you when you're alone. Sometimes you can get mad in the game, like dying and losing some of your items, but that's what it makes it good! I would recommend this to everyone who is deciding to play it, it is really enjoyable and theres alot, ALOT of things you can do it in the game. Enjoy!"

28221,"I <3 this game! I played it on mobile for an ungodly amount of hours on both my ipad and phone, because I am what happens to Ipad kids when they grow up. I got sad that I couldn't go play the newer update on mobile but realized if I just buy it on PC I won't have to wait, and I played for like a week straight only waking up to play and watch daredevil. Best week of my life! For real though this game is beautiful and amazing, but you all already know that don't you... If you were thinking about buying it.... JUST DO IT OMG PLEASE!! It is not one of those games that seem too good to be true and become like pay to play, it is just literally actually this good! <3"

I like that theirs much more than farming, fishing, taking care of animals, and foraging you can also unlock other islands and do a bunch of different quests, mining, fighting monsters, go to special events, give people gifts to get their hearts up for cooking recipes so you can cook more, unlocking the greenhouse so you can grow plants during winter, you can also get married and have kids lol.

28255,It's a wonderful comfort game and honestly helps me cope with anxiety. It's a simple game about farming and fishing and mining with lovely characters to talk to or even romance. It's a fun and relaxing experience all around.

28257,"It is full of details, entertaining, relaxing, exciting and it offers so many different ways in which to play and enjoy! Definitely one of my favorite games <3"
28258,I love playing this game and I love the characters
28259,Farming sim but older Legend of Zelda style layout
28260,"It's a cute, relaxing and fun game! It's slow, as these games tend to be, but things pick up pretty quick when you start getting a cash flow. I highly recommend!"
28261,I have over 400 hours played on my switch... I love the game so much I needed in on PC as well.
28262,"Super chill game, I love the easygoing pace and all the cute NPCs!"
28263,alex <3
28264,i recommend this game because its like mine-craft but 3D and a lot of farming stuff and different missions u can do to get coins.
28265,"This game is so nice and calming, I love just sitting down after a long day of work and coming to this game and just relaxing while exploring everything this game has to offer. I already know I'm going to making multiple worlds so I can play over and over again. I'm 56 hours in and I am nowhere near finished with everything I can explore/collect and I am so happy about that. This game is definitely worth every cent. I really recommend this game to anyone who likes cute, relaxing farming games :D"
28266,This game is amazing
28267,"good
edit : i only started enjoying this game after downloading some mods so i am wondering why won't you just add some of those mods as official features to the game instead of having to mod it ? and add a toggle option in the settings so the player get to choose .
for example the slow/speed time - hp/stamina regen - time stop/flow - mini map ? if it wasn't for these mods i wouldn't have bothered playing but other than that it's fun ."
28268,"Great game

28306,"very fun
"
28307,"Heard a lot of hype for this game. Not disappointed. 

Highly recommend it to anybody who's looking for a chill, stress-free game where you feel like you're building up to something bigger every day. The design, art, gameplay, mechanics, detailed characters, story - Everything about this game is superb. 

The amazing thing about this game is that it was developed by one person. It's a labor of love, and it shows."

28310,"very fun game, many hidden techniques that would allow fast progress or player can choose to play it with a slow pace."
28311,"Is cool, can be gay and that's hot"
28312,This game has helped me manage my anxiety through a very difficult period of change and stress. 100% recommend to anybody who needs to chill and escape from RL for a bit. Even just hearing a few seconds of the soundtrack is enough to relax me if I don't have time to play.
28313,I really like stardew valley because it is calming (sometimes) and it is just a wonderful game to play. the music is amazing and the way it has been made its just beautiful. 10/10 definitely recommend
28314,Still impressed this was made by one guy albeit some network stuff and ports. Amazeballs

28324,"This is hands down my favorite game of all time. Always brings a smile to my face and makes me forget about whatever is stressing me out. ConcernedApe knocked it out of the park with this one, and I can't wait for the Haunted Chocolatier!"
28325,I have enjoyed hitting trees and rocks with the wrong tool and then going to bed at 4pm in a panic.
28326,"amazing game to play by yourself and with friends, cute graphics, and i lobe how you can have mlm/wlw relationships!!"
28327,its very fun
28328,yes
28329,"This game just appeals to me. My bonus son suggested it, and downloaded it for me. Originally, I had it on the PS4, but I felt that the PC version would be easier to play, and it is. There is no wrong way to play it. Sometimes, I set goals to challenge myself, and sometimes I just let it flow. I love figuring things out, but there is so much to do in this game, that getting it all down pat takes a long time, so I don't get bored playing it. I have over 1800 hours in this game and still love it."

28374,"One of my favorite games! I played for probably another hundred hours on switch before I switched to PC. Excellent to try the different types of farms, or to make your goal something different every time you start a new save. My brother and I have a duo farm that's thriving! It's a hell of a lot more than just a farming simulator, there's so much you can do. 

Give it a shot"

28408,"Hands down, this is one of the best games I have ever played. From all the festivals to all the different NPC's and on to everything you can do on your farm. And you find yourself forgetting everything outside the game and going to bed at 4am. 

ConcernedApe did an AMAZING job creating this game and have given me a game that I can always sit down and play alone or with friends. Love it!"
28409,It is both calming and great for those who love organising things.  Fishing is hard to start with but makes lots of money.

28433,Very good game for anyone who likes farming/story line type games.
28434,"[h1]===GAMEPLAY===[/h1]
The combat system is based on spamming left click to kill the monsters found in very specific locations, a very simple but relaxing system that is surrounded by a relaxing gameplay where you decide how fast you want to progress throughout the game.

The game is so relaxed it is impossible for the player to lose: the crops don't die if not watered for days, you can spend an entire year in your house without losing anything, you can't die (you will instead pass out if your health or energy reaches 0).

[h1]===BUGS/MISSED OPPORTUNITIES===[/h1]
The game missed a lot of opportunities, some examples are:
- The clothing system is rather limited (one example is that you can only change the colour of some clothes),
- The colour sliders present when creating a character or painting a building are very limiting (I have found it very hard to make a character with light-blonde hair),
- You can't change your hairstyle at any time and the section of those is very limited (would have loved to be able to pixel-art my own hairstyle),
- The villagers won't change their clothes around the seasons and festivals (it's a bit of a shame to see characters wearing summer clothes in winter!),
- The player doesn't have a birthday.

Bug-wise the game is well polished: There is no bug that will stop you from playing or crash the game. However it is possible for the player to reach areas they are not supposed to reach by using a chair or spamming their swords in specific places.

[h1]===GRAPHICS===[/h1]
The graphics is okay: I find it very simple and clear but a bit oversaturated.

[h1]===REPLAYABILITY===[/h1]
The game can be replayed with different settings (such as farm types, rewards and bundles) and strategies. However the core content (such as the villagers) will remain the same.

[h1]===FINAL VERDICT===[/h1]
Playing the game is a very nice and smooth experience despite the many missed opportunities that can be (at least partially) improved with mods.

[i](My apologies for any mistakes, I'm not a native English speaker.)[/i]"
28435,Such a relaxing game! At the start it had a bit of a learning curve. But you get the gist pretty fast
28436,I had intimate relations with my friend's wife. Very pog.
28437,"Personally I think this game is really cool. It's charming and fun while the graphics are ADORABLE. The events are nice and I like the integration of social life into the game and I think it suited nicely. I haven't done a full playthrough yet, so athough those are just a few things I like, I can't really talk!! Overall I say totally worth it and have fun!! Stay safe <3"
28438,"good, but can get a little boring when you have over 100k g"
28439, I absolutely fell in love with this game. It was exactly what I was looking for at the time and I would say that it is an almost perfect farming RPG!
28440,"Nice and relaxing game. Very fun to play with friends, too."
28441,its relaxing but at the same time it consumed my life i have this on pc a console and mobile

28450,For those whos looking for a chill and relaxing game... then this game is a must especially for those who played harvest moob before
28451,"One of the best games ever, if you're into these types. Game can get repetitive in some aspecs, but there is so much to do and there are so many ways to do it, even in the base/vanilla game. And with the amount of mods and expansions out there, replay value is unending."
28452,"If you look past the fact that the kids will never leave the nest, this game is amazing!"

28457,❤️
28458,so cute!
28459,no graphic and detailed fully animated s*x scene with harvey. very dissatisfied.
28460,"If you enjoy Harvest Moon games and farming simulators, this is the game for you. If you're looking for a relaxing, calming, gem of a casual game, this is also the game for [i] you. [/i] If you're a hoarder (like me), and are looking for a game to satisfy that collectioner's itch - this is [i] also [/i] the game for [b] you! [/b]
Very broad with surprising depth, Stardew Valley distills the HM experience into a game that could be considered the culmination of decades of pixel-based farming game experience - made by one man.

If you've (somehow) exhausted all the Valley has to offer, SV also has an incredibly active modding community, with hundreds of hours worth of extra content only a few mods away - some even add entirely new areas and storylines, to create the most expansive Harvest-Moon-like game ever!

I could not recommend it more."
28461,10/10 farming simulator
28462,"I'll be honest, at first I didn't really like the game, I thought it was kind of boring, but the more my friends got me to play it the better it got. This game is fun, especially if you like to grind for resources, but the grind doesn't have to be hard. Its a lot of fun once you get the hang of the controls and how to build friendships with the villagers C:"

"
28472,I'll keep this short and sweet: I love this game and it literally helped me while I was going through a bad bout of Depression when I first started it in 2020. I still go back to it and find myself addicted over and over again :)
28473,good
28474,"You can farm, make friends, mine, craft, fight, and YOU CAN EAT BUGS. This game is a guilty pleasure for me because I love action games like Garfield Kart and Conan The Mighty Pig but they lack in the whole bug eating aspect. My fascination with this game began when I was a little tot, I used to help my family with the crops that we grew in the fields. We didn't earn much but it was an honest living, growing up in a household of 9. Since I could walk I was helping with the farm. I had to fight worms for potato skins and my 7 siblings for corn and bread. When I was 6 my grampa died in the hospital and he told me his final wish. He told me that in 7 years the best animated snail movie (Turbo) would be released. I couldn't believe it. It was a curse upon my family as soon as it released, the misfortune began. My dad died from a big tapeworm, my mom was struck down by a derelict satellite, and my seven sisters stepped on a landmine. My crops soon died and I was back to fighting the worms"

28513,Really fun and relaxing game
28514,this is the best game i have ever played in my entire life. it will be the best $15 you will ever spend. the replayability never fails to amaze me. I'm over 500 hours in and still completely obsessed. save yourself the hassle and just buy the game already.
28515,I'm a little minor short and stout!
28516,"I LOVE THIS GAME 
"
28517,"JESSIE, I FOUND MY NEW FAVOURITE SIDE BUSINESS JESSIE! I LOVE FARMING THE LEGAL WAY JESSIE!"
28518,its good
28519,"A game all about making the most out of each day and ""striving for excellence in everything you do."" You could just do one task, go to sleep, start a next task, and so on. But the game flows best when you're juggling multiple different things. You'll want to be working on several things at once to be efficient, since it takes time to walk to places. And that's where the game really shines. Occasionally you'll have an off day and go to sleep at like 4pm, but if you think, you'll often be able to come up with a new task that serves your overall purpose. The game manages to impress the importance of filling your day with important things.

The system that is the game as a whole is mechanically and thematically intertwined with itself in many ways. It's a crafting game, and you'll need different resources to make things. Each of the villagers has their likes and dislikes. As said, it takes time to walk places. It's from this complexity that causes the player to need to juggle tasks.

And I haven't even gotten to the psychological benefits of this game. Many people consider this game to be a sort of salve for depression. It takes place in a beautiful, natural valley, it's all about down-to-earth farming of vegetables, fruits, and animals, and you can give gifts to the neighbors and make all sorts of friends.

It's through this context, combined with the mechanics, that this game imparts its one great lesson. It's amazing that this was coded, written, drawn, and musicianed by one person. I think this is Eric's way of passing on his apparent mentality of “Never stop striving to achieve perfection. Settle for nothing less than excellence in everything you do.”

After spending a whole day marathoning the game and reaching 100% perfection, I just got up and randomly did a bunch of chores around the house; I guess it inspired me? Or maybe the chores had been piled up since I hadn't done anything else but play the game for 48 hours? Either way, positive review from me."
28520,I like the game a lot. Its very calming and I like how I can play on my own pace. I think its simple yet complex because of the design and different aspects of the game. I think its well worth the money if you are looking for a game to relax to.
28521,"very chill, helps pass the time"
28522," nice gmaes
"
28523,good
28524,Best farming game ever made.

28528,"I play this game with my boyfriend nearly everyday now, we love the visuals and love farming! If you have the money we 100% suggest you get this game :D"

28553,This game is peaceful but addictive!
28554,"I grew too attached to my first chicken. Their name was Fat Yoshi and it's literally one of the few things that gave me serotonin being overseas during a 2+ years pandemic. I've always felt so isolated and away but in the game me and my actual husband had a wedding.  Being the sentimental biotch I am, that really gave me some peace not actually being with him.  I appreciate the fact that there is no wrong way to play this game. I'm still trying to get all the achievements. I see myself playing for years to come and passing it on to my actual kids ;3 I hope to find more cute indie games like this."
28555,this game gonna give you a chill moment it really fun and very enjoy
28556,kinda mid ngl tbh
28557,I love the way the game flows and the plot of the story. I think it all goes together pretty well.

28559,nice
28560,"This is a really good and classic game, a true masterpiece. Although the game is a bit old, the game itself is really content-rich. I've played this game with a friend of mine for over 50 hours by now. We've reached the winter of the second year. According to my friend (he's played this game for many hours), we're still only halfway through this game. Still a lot to explore for us. Definitely recommend this game."
28561,it's all fun and games until your flamingo gets bombed
28562,"yes, get."
28563,"A very cute and cozy game, great to hop on and make a little bit of progress over time."

28579,very fun. farming nice. Good noises. Happy soundtrack. Good with friends
28580,This game is the reason I'm not getting enough sleep at night. It is engaging with enough variation to keep me playing for hours. I cannot wait to get to the Jorts and Jean mod!
28581,"Very cute came, its fun interacting with the people in down, and lots of things to do! Farming, ranching, foraging, the works.  I like that my friends and I can play. The only thing I wish is that we were able to see the  co-op game ( we have to always use invite codes ) and that it didn't crash as often."
28582,everything.
28583,A great game to wind down for the afternoon and relax for a bit
28584,"Literally the best, and most fun game, I have ever played, and probably my favorite game of all-time. It's so nice to play something that was worth my money and has never tried to get me to spend a cent more."
28585,Fun.
28586,good
28587,e
28588,"Have you ever wanted to get irritated because someone asked you for something you just happened to sell previously? This happened to me frequently, however, the quests that I goofed on seem to come at the same time, so you can plan ahead.  I will give this advice, get the greenhouse ASAP and sprinklers are your friends! I really enjoyed the simplicity of this game as well as the involvement that went into it! Personally I am looking forward to the Haunted Cholotier if this is how it's going to be!"
28589,It has chickens
28590,"I heard a lot of things about this game before I bought it. A simple farming sim with lots of fun things to do. I figured that at minimum I'd play for a bit. I made it through my first year, and while I was still learning the game, I found it at least interesting and a way to pass the time. not to mention, with my PC being basically a Nokia with a potato for a processor, it was and is about the only thing I can run smoothly. I played through a few more years, and while I'm nowhere near great at the game, I enjoy it immensely. I've put in almost 150 hours, now, and even bought a few copies for friends to play. Online play is a little wonky but I find that to be true of most online games. 8/10."
28591,gud
28592,The only thing I don't like is that you can't save before you fight in a cave or do something really important that could go terribly wrong and then it auto saves at the end of the day. I don't mind the end of day save. The rest of this game is awesome!!!!!! and Concerned Ape has a really interesting creative mind and sense of humor. I play this all the time and enjoy everything. I don't do well with the monsters but practice makes perfect. Once I stopped being scared of them I was better. My favorite part is fishing. I would have liked to see a more realistic horse but I'm good with the way it is.
28593,"Great game, super easy to loose time in the world that it makes for you."
28594,its so fun and just a lied back game.
28595,poggers
28596,"This is an amazing game, you can do anything you want and never get bored of it. You can go fishing, mining, farming or even just walk around the town and build a relationship with all the town's people! One of the best games I have ever played.
"
28597,"such a vibey game, big serotonin ! i recommend very much, spent so long in one sitting that my neck hurts but thats my own fault"

28605,no
28606,"I've only played Stardew Valley for 50 hours at the time of this review but it is one of the best games I've ever played. I was sceptical about buying this game as I had purchased it in the past and refunded it, but I finally decided to give it a second chance and I never looked back. It is not like any game I've played in the past, there is so much to do and that's what I love about this game. From farming crops to marrying one of the 12 available marriage candidates, there is something for everyone to enjoy. Stardew Valley is a beautiful game with so much things to discover and I highly recommend this game to anyone wanting to try it out."
28607,great game
28608,"I did not think I would be torn with this game. Stardew Valley, from what anyone and everyone who praised it told me, was supposed to be a type of game I enjoy. Farming, collecting, fishing; whatever you want to do, you do at your own leisure. I like management games, I like expanding and collecting and socialising with NPCs. When I started playing this game, I thus thought that its appeal would be a non-issue for me. Maybe it was that expectation that lead me wrong.

I think that Stardew Valley is a good game. It looks good, has plenty of different things to do, it has good mechanics and a variety that never disappoints. NPCs have individual cut scenes linked to your social progression with them, giving glimpses into characters that have their own interests and problems and, crucially for such an idyllic setting, aren't always well adjusted members of the community. For the first 20, 30, maybe even 50 hours this game really holds up as the small town experience it seeks to emulate.

So why am I so somber? Well, while Stardew Valley has a lot of choice, I never felt free while playing it. The game has a shockingly rapid pace, with in-game days that go by fast enough that I always found myself running from one location to the other, sometimes opening the menu just to take a bit of a break. I often found myself desperately trying to squeeze in tasks before the dreaded ""zZz""-symbol formed over my head, signalling the ticking clock to get back to your bed before collapsing. Before getting automation options, half a day often goes by before you're even done with your chores, leaving precious little time to do anything else.

On top of this, there is almost nothing in the game that you can straight-up avoid. It is part of the design of the game; to get materials for upgrades for yourself and the community, you have to interact actively with pretty much all that the game has to offer, from fishing to mining to fighting enemies. There are constant, strong incentives to pursue new things in the game. That sounds fine, even great, until you realise that your least favorite task is going to be pretty much mandatory for the rest of the game.

Quests further works to pull you in one direction or the other, with side quests having tight deadlines to chase resources and item drops that might not even show up after two in-game days of grinding because of the random drop chance. To pursue them means even more focus has to be put on maximising your time and effectivising your process. For long periods in this game, I wasn't doing what I wanted to do, instead chasing upgrades and quest objectives. There is something darkly capitalistic about it all, which to me clashes with the positive, anti-corporate values that the game seemingly wants to convey.

Despite this, there is a real addictive element to the game; partially because the core gameplay loop is quite good, but also because you simply [i]want[/i] to do everything you can to serve the community of the game. That's the truly toxic thing, that quests are linked to friendship progression with the characters, charging often mindless tasks with the value of social acceptance, however simulated. Ironically, you end up spending less time with the characters in service of becoming friends with them faster.

I liked Stardew Valley, at least mostly. It might sound strange after everything I've written here, but I do think that this is a game that is worth playing. However, I would offer a word of advice: Don't listen to what the game is telling you. Don't do side quests that don't serve your own enjoyment. Don't chase resources endlessly. Only do what you want to do in the moment, and exclude everything else. Let things take time. If you can do that, then I think that you'll have a much better experience with this game than I had."
28609,Abigail is really pretty
28610,:DD
28611,"fun game in every aspect except for me spending 12 irl hours of my life trying to get a girl to romance me with gifts I farmed ingame for so long, just for her to deny me :C"
28612,My absolute favorite game.  I've played on Switch for years & just made the change to PC.  Cannot recommend a game more.
28613,fun
28614,it is fun and nice :)
28615,"Hours and hours of fun, just a relaxing play."

28619,"Great game, really chill to play. There is a storyline with objectives to complete if you want to but you can go at your own pace and play how you want."
28620,"pretty fun game. 
- the music is absolutely amazing
- the game itself is pretty fun
- the characters are decent
- the farm gameplay along with other features are super fun to mess with
- the season system adds a lot to love about the map and the game in general.
- the quests and other things can fly over my head, but most are fun."
28621,Super fun and amazing and the best farming simulator ever.
28622,"it's a great game to chill out with. You get caught up and loose days so beware. Super cute, wholesome and very happy making."
28623,"i played stardew on PS4, after selling my PS4 i missed playing it and knowing there was so many new updates i couldnt help but buy it again. its an amazing game that allows you to have a calm and fun experiance being a farmer and hopefully romancing one of the many bachelors and bachelorettes."
28624,i love to farm. maybe i should go outside in real life.
28625,satisfies my egirl needs
28626,almost makes me want to go outside
28627,"Honestly, this game is incredible. I've spent so much time here, but also playing on Switch with my son in co-op. He's 5 and loves spending time with me playing the game. Great gameplay, great story, imaginative gameplay. Seriously the best."
28628,Better Version of Harvest Moon :)

28630,It is a fun game.
28631,Wholesome and addicting game. 11/10
28632,my faovourite
28633,"When I first heard about this game I thought it would be overrated, I did not expect to love a farming sim game. It is very relaxing, very addicting and very fun. I love the characters and the hidden secrets the game has. Each character has something different to offer making it difficult to choose just one bachelor. I like the daily routines I do on the game, such as greeting the towns folk, taking care and collecting from my animals, decorating, mining, cooking, fishing and so much more! The achievements are fun to collect. The game can get pretty challenging after a certain point, but never dull. Playing with friends also adds a whole new feels to the game! I love both single player and multiplayer! Stardew Valley has truly become my favorite game, theres mods you can use if you ever get tired of the amazing art, theres expansion mods adding a whole new other layer to the game and there are quality of life mods making some things easier than others. The wiki for this game helped me out so much when I first started the game and the community is just so wholesome and amazing. I love Stardew Valley and I thank concernedApe for creating such an amazing game. My overall rating is 10/10. ♡"
28634,+
28635,YES
28636,Love this game so much! After 560+ hours i still feel like there is so much more to this game. Favorite game of all time <3

28642,"Amazing game! A lot of fun every time I come back to it. It has many things to do and you can choose 
your own way to play. Overall pretty good"
28643,much pog
28644,"One of the most peaceful games I have ever played! I first played this on my switch but I had to get it on steam. It was totally worth it and no matter how many hours I've played it, I still am not bored with it. There's always something to do whether it be farming or fishing, forging, going in the caves or even talking to the people in town. This game is totally worth it and it's even more fun when you're playing with friends!"
28645,Trailer trash bitches really raise my corn stocks
28646,Game good. Big fun. Such excite. Much wow.
28647,Stardew Valley trully takes you closer to the nature by giving experience of the amateur farmer.
28648,"Music is great, gameplay as well. Interesting story, though it may seem limited. So much to explore and progress."
28649,always knew this game was good however i never got to myself to actually play it for a longer amount of time. i still havent played as much as i need to but this game is actually very deep and has a lot to do. perfect game for anyone whos looking for a game to just chill and have some fun on a farm lol
28650,This game brings me so much joy. I have no other words!!!!!!
28651,This is the best game ever created
28652,Lovely gameplay. Relaxing and easygoing. Good for people with anxiety issues or stress.

28668,"This game was gifted to me by a friend, and I consider it to be one of the best gifts I've ever gotten. I have never played a game more balanced than this. While I found combat and fishing to be difficult at the start, it is easy to master. There is  literally no wrong way to play this game, you can even cosplay as a person how has their sh*t together!
Yet, despite its amazing features, the greatest feat it has achieved is its community. SV has the most supportive community one will ever be a part of, no toxicity to be found (other than the Haley trash talk)."
28669,"yes

28673,"I didnt expect to drain such a substantial amount of time on this game but it has surpassed my expectations of enjoyability. Farming, mining and befriending npcs are all things I can do here and even though its simple in its nature it still gives grindy goodness galore."

Farming game with lots of events and stuff to do. 10/10

[h1]Pros: [/h1]
-Very fun
-Lots of content
-Supports multiplayer
-Easily can be played for years
-Lots of mods for quality of life upgrades or just some spice to the game
-Community is warm and friendly

[h1] Cons [/h1]
-The endgame is kinda hellishly grindy and RNG based (not really a con but its kinda annoying)
-Lots of stuff to keep track/memorise/google for crafting and farming (some people might not find it interesting to remember many stuff or keep on needing to google)

[h1] Overall [/h1]
This game doesn't really have cons, just pros. 10/10 recommended for people who like to play farm games with friends at a cheap and affordable price with loads of content."
28684,I'm not a person who enjoys farming games but Stardew Valley is... magical. I like it.
28685,:)
28686,Melon Wine Farming Simulator 2022
28687,best game ever
28688,"Stardew Valley is a very time consuming game, which gets me in trouble at times but I'm glad I got it. If you don't like slow paced games this might not be for you though!"
28689,Fav game :) never gets old
28690,Very Dewy
28691,"I can't possibly cover everything I want to say here, but I've posted my thoughts on Stardew Valley on my blog. You can check it out here: https://mrdavepizza.com/stardew-valley-a-praiseworthy-staple-game-about-farming-fishing-sleeping-and-living/

Just a drop in the pond here, I'm sure, but naturally, this is one of my favorite games I have ever played. I've played it on Switch, Steam, and Android, and it works well with each system. It's kind of confusing to see an indie game that's so immensely popular and wonder if it is really indie with its often genre-specific usual quirkiness. It's really an independent work of art though, and it made me feel so good as I sat down to really see what it's about. Farming, yes, gathering, yes, but it's an open world that's ready to be imprinted by your creativity.

Here's some gameplay for you, yes you, you someone out there reading this. Just some demonstration of the game in action though from my original review:

Put the shorts in the soup."
28700,This is both the most stressful and relaxing game I've played
28701,pretty cool
28702,"I liked that even with the simplicity of the pixelated artwork, there is a significant amount of depth to the character development. I am only finishing my 2nd year, but I am happy with how tranquil I feel when I play this game. It's something to just relax to."
28703,very fun
28704,very nice game

28706,Fulfilled my dream of being an emo farmer
28707,"so cute and so fun, multiplayer is super nice. the character stories and are in depth and nice"
28708,"Not just a farming sim, you can forage, fish, and create relationships with the villagers, which includes some hard to deal with things, but its a great way to understand how you think to these situations to help process emotions even if these are fake people on your screen, you can always learn healthy and thoughtful ways to deal with different situations."
28709,okay
28710,Fun
28711,Addicting to farm (plus getting married in the game is a nice touch). Also really fun to play with friends
28712,"Such a comforting game, the music is so calming"

28716,"I fucking hate this game. I really really did try to like it but it is just so tedious and boring,"
28717,"Great relaxing game, fun for all ages"
28718,yesnt
28719,i may only have 3 hours on steam but between switch and xbox i have 100s of hours i havaen't found a better way to wind down after work other than this!!!!!
28720,I hate mayor lewis I will build my empire to overthrow him. I can't stand mayor lewis. I CANT S T AN D M A Y O R L E W IS.
28721,"It's a great immersive game that you can get lost in for hours at a time. If you get bored, you can always start another game on a different farm to experience a different style of farming (like the hill top, the beach, or the forest farms). Many thanks to Eric Baronne for so many good updates with new content! Please continue to fix bugs and tweak the quality of life items."
28722,good videogame
28723,"Absolutely stunning. I am with a gaming emo boy irl and I'm able to also be with a gaming emo boy in this game, fantastic. 10/10, and the game has frogs ❤️"
28724,Stardew Valley is far from a quaint little farming simulator. It's packed with so much extra content that its like a game within a game. It's my go-to no matter what.
28725,"great game, should be in anyone's library"
28726,I recomend this game to literally all of my friends. They all say oh its lame and then they play it and next thing they know they have been playing for 12 hours straight.
28727,"パンダの好きな餌は？

パンだ。"
28728,i expected a relaxing farming game that my friends have recommended to me. what i got was a game that if you were too slow or didn't do something then that opportunity would only come around in the next year. There isn't enough time during the day and the price rises after year 1 raise resource costs to 4x the price. most of my playtime was checking the wiki with the game running in the background so i could understand how to craft something or what to give an NPC. I only played up to the start of year 2. if that takes 10 hours to reach year 2 then what happens if you decide to restart and make a new save because you want community centre in year 1? You have just wasted 10 hours on this game for what? I would only recommend you buy this if you felt like spending a crap ton of time on it for low-zero returns / sense of accomplishment.
28729,"Still can't believe this was made by one person.
10/10"
28730,cozy comfy

28735,literally what a game oh my god
28736,GOOD STUFF.
28737,"I used to play on psn, and it's good there too, just wanted to get to play with mods.  I think I've spent 2x the time searching for/editing/installing mods so... Like... it's good... but like... >.> be prepared"
28738,This is my second time revisiting the game and I had forgotten how good it was. I can't wait to get to end game to enjoy the new content! I'm having so much fun :)
28739,good good
28740,best
28741,"I would recommend this game to absolutely anybody. There is so much more than meets the eye and it surpasses expectations every single time. The only downside is that I will play it for 14 hours without noticing how much time has gone by. 36/10. If you’re on the fence, you should get it."
28742,relaxing
28743,"Definitely a cozy game, but a cozy game any kind of gamer can enjoy. Multiplayer is amazing, but so is spending time making your own farm."
28744,Peaceful and relaxing. Sandbox game with an insane amount of content.
28745,"Stardew Valley is a very peaceful game, it's helped me on off days and it's brought me enjoyment on good days.So, if you're looking for a game to play on off time that helps you to be calm, then Stardew Valley is absolutely for you."
28746,game fun... ha ha... haa
28747,I think my hours can speak for themselves. The free updates keep me coming back and making new games just to see what I discover next.

28755,Good game

28773,"hi
"
28774,"It's an amazing game, 400 hours in and I just found out about the mods for it"
28775,"I love Stardew Valley. I first started playing on my Nintendo Switch, and that is my personal preferred console to play on (no other reason that I'm used to the controls better). I also bought it for PC to play co-op with my PC friends. There are so many different aspects of the game that I love: farming, crafting, adventuring, exploring, friendship, and a variety of challenges and quests that you can do. I have loved this game for a few years and on my switch I have almost 200 hours. I definitely recommend this game to basically anyone!"
28776,good game very queer
28777,"If Stardew Valley is so good, where is Stardew Valley 2? This isn't a question this is a demand."

28784,"I love nearly everything about this game. The characters are cute, the storys are interesting and it is really nice that you have so many possibilitys to create your own Farm/World."
28785,"Relaxing, Great to play with friends or by yourself, great storyline and good flow and not to expensive"
28786,I will die playing this game.
28787,"A beautiful, cozy little game. Perfect solo on a stay-at-home day or over voice chat with friends. Stardew Valley is everything I've ever wanted it to be filled with farming, fishing, mining, relationship-building, and light combat. If you like Animal Crossing, Minecraft, or just want a game to sit back and relax to, here it is."
28788,"Much more than your simple farming game. So much to do! So much to discover! So many secrets to discover!
Love the game and can't wait to boot it up again once completed, with the Extended mod."
28789,Stardew Valley
28790,good way to waste all your damn time and if your love language is gift giving
28791,"I've tried to get into the game a number of times, there's not a lot of direction and playing multiplayer relies on others being at either the same stage as you or playing regularly with you.

The seasonal mechanics are pretty good and there's some kind of loop you can get into the swing of, and it has some secrets to the game, but it's another one of those games that you need a wiki open on another monitor to get the most out of it because it feels like it doesn't guide you a lot.

Didn't manage to hold my interest."
28792,Cute game and nice music to chill or kill time with.
28793,"Amazingly written characters make this relaxing game feel like a living, breathing world. Props to ConcernedApe."
28794,"Initially thought it's just a farming game, however realised there's a lot of things to do in this game; fishing, mining and slaying monsters. You thought you're going to be done with this game, but you're just at the beginning. It can be challenging when it comes to tricky fishes. However the only cons i feel is that we do not have a lot of health which can be a lil annoying at times. :')"

28800,"Stardew Valley is a masterpiece in its entirety. The game-play is fun and relaxing, though challenging at times. The soundtrack is amazing! The relationship system is cute and all the NPC's are individual and each has a great story and personality. The art is stunning as well!. If you enjoy games like Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing, you'll likely enjoy this game. The praise I have for this game is truly endless and I'll always recommend Stardew Valley!"
28801,lol buy it
28802,"stardew, more like stardoo"
28803,only get it if you'll marry shane
28804,"HIGHLY recommended!
- Great music, scenery & art.
- Interesting story & character interactions.
- High replay value! & definitely worth its price tag.
- Fun with friends & solo!
- SO much to do, you're always doing something every second of the game.

I stream the game sometimes, If you'd like to check it out for my live reactions playing the game: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1273185505?filter=highlights&sort=time"

28818,gud game
28819,It's such a cute wholesome game with so much going for it. 102 hours into the game and i'm still finding new items and ideas for how to improve and make the most of what i have. An Absolute 10/10 Highly recommend

28825,Play it. Just do it.
28826,i love the game so much but i lost most of my progress because of a thing with the cloud. i am in pain :')
28827,"I do recommend those who like farming not much else to say

Though this game has very special aspects to it such as the characters and atmosphere. Much like Shane, a character in this game. Him and I share many aspects in life and we are both similar."
28828,"i recommend Stardew Valley to all my farm, life simulator loving gaming friends. Stardew valley is that wholesome cozy game you want to cuddle up with on a day off and just get lost in hours of game play. You have a wonderful balance of fishing, farming, mining, monsters, and falling in love and making friends throughout the game. Stardew Valley is my number 1 game i have over 4,000 plus hours combined in all my devices."
28829,"Stardew is one of the best game i played in the top 3 with minecraft and terraria i haven't played as many hours as others and  still learning new things about the game which after 200 hours and im still learning things makes this game one of the best on steam
"
28830,love it
28831,comfort game ong
28832,"Stardew Valley is an amazing game filled with content. It's pixel art, sound design, and overall gameplay are extremely well executed. The games pacing and mechanic's allow for an extremely balanced difficulty that any player can master and enjoy. The story, character's and world are heartfelt and incredibly enjoyable.

 I'd highly recommend this title to anyone especially at its price.

Some aspects of the game can feel quite 'grindy',repetitive, and boring, but overall there is great replayablity in choosing which farming strategies you would like to implement, which character's stories to follow, and overall farm design.

28840,"If you like this genre, why haven't you tried this game yet? Worth it."
28841,"It's a super relaxing game, with very much to do and things to uncover. The game doesn't force you to a specific path, giving you almost full control of what your objectives are and how you play. Very fun to play alone and also with friends, and with great language support for Brazilian Portuguese.

Great game overall, and impressive for being an almost one man job!"

28844,Shclimbus likin he bowl and run in around ver fast!!!!
28845,"Stardew Valley is a wonderful 2D experience with beautiful scenery, loving community with their own twisted plotlines, and many attributes that make it a great, time-consuming game for those wanting to get lost in the wilderness, start anew and build your way up! Find love within Pelican Town or victory down in the mines from fearsome battles and live the humbling life of a farmer. 

Overall Stardew Valley is a great game, one worth the purchese, however it can be boring at times. The characters themselves are all quite entertaining and hold their own heavy truths but I wish there were more random dialogue! Perhaps while either Shane or Sam are off to go to Jojo Market and you approach to talk, they could say, ""Sorry, I'm in a hurry!"" or, ""Sorry, (insert player name)! I'm almost late to my shift!"" and continue on.

The bachelors and  bachelorettes by themselves can hold some pretty heavy topic and truly make you feel some sympathy for them, but that can, of course, take time with some being portrayed as arrogant, like bachelor Alex, or a simple drunk, like bachelor Shane. I've done my own bit of researching with these twelve town folk and some of the marriage aspects are a little disappointing and I wouldn't mind some changes, but overall their personalities and lifestyle can truly catch the eye of the player and I'm sure some players have a relatable backstory with these twelve characters.

The townspeople have their own share of drama that can be shown through dialogue or through heart cut scenes which, in my opinion, really bring this game's community to life! It really shows how much the developers of Stardew Valley have inputted the detail needed to really make everything pop out! The monthly events are amazing and far more enjoyable with those the player is close with (I highly suggest getting those hearts up for the Spring Dance! I already faced enough rejection in Year 1...). 


I'd happily give Stardew Valley an 8/10, I wish there were some more details within the characters or just something simple put together to really bring out how the townspeople are on their day-to-day lives with dialogue to match what they're doing. While I'm highly enjoying the game and loving every bit of it, my only complaints are minor things to due with the people of Pelican Town, but other than that the game is extraordinary and very enjoyable to play when you have free time or need something to pass it."

28858,great
28859,"It says 280 hours, but I have played about 300+ more on modded, plus a ton on Switch. I cant express how much I love this game, and how it keeps me coming back. It really has a bit of everything and it makes every playthrough feel fresh."
28860,Very good Very nice
28861,I LOVE SHANE <3
28862,A classic farming game I always come back to. My only warning is that the townie stories were a bit jarring around the relaxing scenery so be warned some heavy life themes are shared here but I think it adds to the charm of this game giving it a little more realisim while you play.
28863, i like it and stuff ig

I highly recommend this game to those who want a free play experience, as well as those who are highly motivated by achievements and accomplishments."

28891,Stardew valley is my favorite farming sim game (and honestly probably my favorite game period). I recommend it to any gamer of any kind to give a shot. You'd be surprised how much you might enjoy it.
28892,"I own this game on Xbox, Switch, and PC.  it is by far my Fav!  it is even better in co op online mode.  but it eats all your time."

28896,"I first played it alone many years ago, lots of fun. A couple months ago, when I found out they had added much more content, I tried the split screen with my wife. It was pretty much her first video game, and she loved it too. Great singleplayer game, great couple game."
28897,"Extremely zen. If you like Harvest Moon, you will like Stardew Valley more. Farming and dating sim with tons of stuff to do. There literally aren't enough hours in the day to do everything that you want."
28898,"Starts off a little slow, but picks up speed really fast. In both how addicting it becomes and how enjoyable and how more or less grindy the game becomes. It gets more fun towards the end trust me I’ve already bought the game on mobile and loved it."

28907,"Fantastic game, lots to do and keep busy with, and has great co-op.
Also, when you've run out of content, try modding! There is a huge community of modders that are very dedicated to Stardew Valley."
28908,"A lot of hours for a game I ""don't even like"". Absolutely not recommended for 100% if you don't feel THE GRIND, but otherwise a fun and cute experience. Just wish these days weren't always so short..."
28909,Cute and fun game. Good solo and co-op play
28910,"Amazing game! I first got it from Game Pass on the XBOX store, but just had to buy it permanently. This game has everything you could want. Beautiful maps, fishing, farming, mining, PvE, story-based elements. Everything comes together to create an amazing gameplay experience, whether you are looking to chill with friends or fight monsters."

28968,so adorable and wholesome AND you can be gay 10/10
28969,Stardew is a great game. Its like Minecraft and Terreria but with wayyy more NPC interaction and it is a GRIND! It is pretty boring alone though I would definitely play with a friend.
28970,"I usually don't like ""cartoon"" games but Stardew is one of the best. It's super relaxing and had good challenges in the game. Plus, I like how I can invite friends to join me."
28971,everyone's favorite coping mechanism :) best part is it works
28972,"are you gay? if yes, play this."

28975,"One of my favorite games ever that I will gladly pay for a second time after originally playing it on console. So much about this game is addicting in a good way. There are very few things that I dislike about it.

If you like RPGs, farming games, simulators, or basically video games in general - you will probably like this game"
28976,The most relaxing game in the world.
28977,one of the best games i've ever played. it's really satisfying to build up your farm and there are so many hidden things to discover in the game that make it so much fun. highly recommend!
28978,game nice
28979,"Went fishing and failed twice, my next time, it gave me garbage. 10/10"
28980,"good game
"
28981,Decent
28982,This game is so relaxing. It helps me wind down from a long and stressful day. I would definitely recommend to any college student who needs an escape.
28983,
28984,"This game is perfect if you enjoy a chill, cozy RPG. it is one of my favourite games and i definetly reccomend it to anyone"
28985,"Hard to believe this amazing game was the brainchild of a lone man with a minimal understanding of video game development, on a Costco prebuilt PC. Years of interesting playable content, simple combat system, easy to grasp controls, and the most engaging stories I've ever experienced in a pixel game. Excited for ConcernedApe's next game as well!"
28986,fun gam
28987,"Im still a long way from reaching the end game for this game but I am enjoying the journey so far. I originally bought the game so I can make a co-op game with my them. It was fun for the time we spent together but after a while we grew apart and I stopped talking to them so there was no point in playing the co-op world anymore. Because of this I had started a new world and I am currently only on the first season of year 1 but I am enjoying the gameplay especially since I know what I am doing now.

The gameplay loop is very enjoying and not too repetitive, the NPCs feel real and I love talking to them. BUT WHY DO THEY NEED SO MANY GIFTS! The community behind this game is amazing and I downloaded a few mods to make my gameplay even more enjoyable (anime mod <---- you need this)

Overall, the game is very enjoyable and I love finding new things as each season passes. This game is not for everyone but if you're a casual gamer or someone who loves animal crossing and the such, then I highly recommend this game"
28988,"addicting but wholesome

29000,"I love how the quests have it's purpose and it's like narrative, but quests to complete the game. It's fun."
29001,"Stardew Valley is a pretty good game for what it is, though it's a bit outside of my usual preferences. It's pleasant, relaxing, and has just enough challenge to be engaging without being stressful (unless you want to hyper-optimize everything, in which case I suspect it could give Factorio a run for its money). However, I've definitely got a lot of gripes, which are mostly things that bother me because they're the only things keeping me from getting really immersed and most of them feel like they could have been fixed with moderate to zero effort. Keep in mind that all of these are things that I found the core gameplay good enough to forgive, but these things annoy me enough I still want to complain about them.
- controls are a bit janky. I don't know how many times I've gifted a villager an item they hate or that I desperately needed for something else because I forgot what my menu was set to, or set off a bomb on my farm that broke a bunch of expensive equipment because I wasn't close enough to interact with the thing I meant to, but it was way too many. Two thirds of my controls woes would be solved if they just mapped separate buttons for ""interact"" and ""use item"". I suspect this might be the fault of console compatibility.
- The combat mechanics feel both token and out of place. They could honestly have ditched mining entirely and made metals a thing you just buy from the blacksmith without hurting the gameplay much, but even if they insisted on keeping mining and smelting in the game the combat isn't very good and they should have found a better way to spice up the process of mining than filling the mines with monsters to fight. It's also a major tonal clash since outright violence feels so out of place in the world of the rest of the game. Heck, even filling the mines with monsters you can't fight and have to avoid would have been both more fitting and more interesting than the half-assed combat the game actually has.
- I feel like the difficulty of the random quests (especially the large ones) wasn't playtested at all. Some of them you can knock out with a dedicated game-day of work or spare time before the deadline while others feel grindy to finish before the deadline. A few of them are even worse because they include a random element or require harvesting a resource that might or might not even spawn in sufficient quantity to meet the quota before the deadline.
- The difficulty curve of befriending villagers is completely upside down. At first it's a daunting task because you need to figure out what they like and gifts are expensive in the early game, then you start finding hints about the right gifts and you start having enough money that gifts aren't hard to provide, and eventually you've maxed out their affection and they give you free gifts while you have no need to invest further time or thought into befriending them.
- The menus are missing a lot of much-needed quality of life features. Basic things like a ""number to buy/sell/transfer"" selector so you don't need to manually click a bunch of times, or a quick eat button so you don't need to sit through the eating animation seven times if you're eating small things that don't restore much stamina."
29002,its fun. i just wanted to say i liked it but its making me write smthing. so its fun.
29003,"i love pretty much everything about this game, just wish there was a way to make vinegar yourself!"
29004,very relaxing
29005,i love
29006,Excellent game to relax and play with friends.
29007,the cult is wierd
29008,"When your real life is out of control, Stardew is here to have your back. Well-structured farming system, mining for components and collectibles while also having a mild RPG feel while fighting off monsters in the caves. Deep character development with an overall cohesive and intriguing main story line with lots of side paths to take that divert you onto more details about Pelican Town, the Junimos and other creatures, and even the Joja Mart. Rare side events and rare obtainable items, and hard to achieve romances make the game very addicting and the stability and structure feels pleasant and calming to how I can plan out my day to either farm, fish, mine, or partake in other events. Challenging yearly events for each season also really keep you on your toes. The game is a masterpiece among farming simulators and I would also consider it much more of a farming simulator considering the romance and detailed dialogue for each towns person also makes this game a light dating sim and also very light RPG mechanics with other fun mini games like the fishing as well. The fun and amount of things to do never ends."
29009,"Listen, if you've got someone in your life telling you to get this game, but you don't think you will, trust me when I say this. I'm not a ""cute-gamer"", I don't enjoy farming sims, dating sims, or slice-of-life, and I've put well over 300 hours on my PS4 version of this game, and 20+ hours on this one. Just give in, I promise it will be worth it."
29010,love it
29011,The game is great :) I find my self losing track of time playing this!
29012,"Reviews of Stardew Valley are unnecessary at this point, so I'm just going to say that I'm considering using the soundtrack while playing Devil Daggers, because you have to stay cool and relaxed and what is more cool and relaxing than Stardew Valley? One of the few soundtracks I can play on repeat."
29013,My Balls Itch
29014,"good game, nice to play while watching something in the background."
29015,"2nd best game I've ever played. It's a very time consuming game, but its worth it. So if you have a lot of time on your hands then I recommend playing."
29016,its a really cool and relaxing game for me
29017,good game
29018,Nice
29019,"Simply love this game, and love people loving this game.


Pros: 
+ Amaizing chill graphics and sountrack. 
+ Atmosphere of this game is very wellcoming and relaxing.
+ Villagers makes you feel like part of family.
+ Seasons changing.
+ With getting to know better villigers you will get to know more about their story.
+ It has multiplayer. 
+ Easy that even small children will uderstand it.

Cons:
- Actually I hate that many mechanics developer robbed from harvest moon/story of season frenchise. But I have to admit that he made it smoother and polished.

Result : It is hard for me to not get hyped anytimes somone mentions this game. For me it is 10/10. Even tho i dont usually buy games twice I got this on nintendo switch and played it outside, in train, at bed... and it felt great."
29020,YES
29021,like
29022,"this is the best game ever, so cozy and lovely. highly recommend."
29023,"nice therapy
rarely buy games off promos but this one is worth it
10/10 but im marrying emily prob and cristal girls should be a no go"
29024,good
29025,Awesome Game!
29026,its a great game
29027,Stardew Valley is absolutely something I would recommend to anyone seeking a game that they can escape into; the amount of content and the different options the game offers allows you to enjoy the game regardless of what level of player you are.
29028,This is one of the few games that I always come back to. It always feels comforting to return to the village when I've been away for a while <3
29029,"After playing this game for nearly 15 hours, even if I am nowhere near knowledgeable about it, I must recommend it. If, like me, you dream of having your own farm but are not sure if that dream will ever come true, and are looking for a nice, peaceful game to escape from life for a couple of hours, Stardew Valley is for you. You can do a lot in this game (no, it's not just farming), from mining to exploring to socializing to fighting slime. All of these aspects of the game have their own mechanics which you will learn over time, and your dedication to them will pay off big time in the long run. However, the heart of the game is what truly won me over, and that is how idyllic and quaint it is. A simple but fulfilling life, where you actually feel productive and where relationships truly matter. Isn't that the dream? If you want a surprising but relaxing experience, buy this game."
29030,Absolutely pure game that I love. It never gets boring and I've been achievement hunting which makes it even more fun. The creator keeps adding new stuff to the game which is awesome :) 10/10 recommend
29031,One of my absolute favorite games. I love the characters and the storyline.
29032,"Very fun and relaxing. great for long plane rides, and even better with friends!"
29033,Love this game! Tons of replay value! Lots of fun mods available for it too to further extend playing!
29034,"Reminds me of a simpler time.
Playing Harvest Moon as a kid with my Gameboy Advance.
But modernized with loads more content."
29035,I love the game
29036,calming and fun
29037,Highly enjoyable 10/10
29038,Cute and relaxing. But it really unfolds its potential when you play it with your partner. Couch co-op makes this the perfect couples game.
29039,jut amazing little grindy tho
29040,yes.. fun
29041,Great chill game to play!
29042,"Great game, unique storytelling and very nice graphics. I instantly fell in love with the game and the characters. The modding community is also great (except the porn mods). What?????' this is a farming game?"
29043,"nothing makes you feel better than seeing starfruit 
"
29044,"This is a wonderful game. There is much more to it than at first glance and the many mods that are easily applied can alter the world both in gameplay and appearance. I guess it has some things in common with games like minecraft, terreia, and animal crossing, but is entirely unique and has a lot of role playing elements. It's cute and relaxing (for me). I don't think I've ever enjoyed a game this much!"
29045,I love this game
29046,its fucking amazing
29047,fun
29048,this is the best game ever no joke
29049,"Slife of Life 
"
29050,"If you need a break from Animal Crossing, or something calming to do, give Stardew a try."
29051,:D
29052,"The only thing that could make this game a 10/10 would be if it were 3D. That being said, this game is a solid 9.5/10 for me. 

I'll be honest i obtained this game long ago through... other means *wink wink* 
However i had some extra money and bought it, and started playing it again after a few years of not playing it. This developer fully deserves every cent. (and mind you for the price tag its a great game, as compared to other needlessly expensive farming style games that leave your mind numb and emotionless *cough fs22* )

the developer for this game (concerned ape) is truly a rare treasure nowadays where other developers abandon their games. Not this dev. He loves his little(big) creation and continues to pump updates YEARS after the game has already passed its highest point(player interest) and continues making it better.

That being said, the game is GREAT! And even better still with mods like stardew valley extended (can find it on nexus)."
29053,Good fishing 10/10
29054,hehehe stardew valli
29055,Amazing game. Nice and ralaxing
29056,Played a bit. Pretty Good.
29057,"Escapism, pure escapism. Great for when you don't have internet access, I have over 400 hours in here and I'm not stopping anytime soon."
29058,The best calming game I've ever played in my life. I've had an obsession with this game for over a year and a half now.
29059,"It's so chill and fun! I'd recommend it to a lot of my friends! My friends ask what I'm doing all the time, I say ""Stardew Valley! It's very chill and it keeps you busy with quests. Definitely worth the money if you want a chill game to loose time playing!"""
29060,"do ever feel things when listening to g00d music? like that particular arrangement of beeps and boops were made specifically for you to taste in that specific moment kinda thing? 
it's the same thing with Stardew Valley, but as a game."
29061,"game let me get a girlfriend, something not possible irl. 10/10 great game
"
29062,very versatile game. everyone should try it and see how they like it at some point
29063,very  fun i love planting plants
29064,very good very good i like the ducks a lot
29065,"almost as great as me
"
29066,"Absolutely incredible Harvest Moon-like game with a great modding community, definitely worth it!"
29067,"As someone with over 1,000 hours in this game all I can say to you is just buy the game and play it. You don't need to have a specific goal in mind. You don't even need to finish the game or get far into it. The game itself without getting into all the lore and perfection runs and all of that is just so relaxing and its really fun to play and explore the mechanics of the game. Personally I really love the fact that you are able to romance people and start a family along with being able to romance people of the same gender. As someone who identifies with the LGBTQ+ community having the ability in a game to marry and have a relationship with someone of the same gender and of your choice and then being able to have children with your spouse is really nice. Having that sort of representation in something as interactive as a video game is really amazing. For me I don't see a lot of representation, I mean obviously I know there is some, but for someone who doesn't watch a lot of shows and movies it's nice to have some representation in something I do take part in and have it as interactive as it is. This only scratches the surface on how well the characters are written and how many of the characters have relatable and representative stories. Each character has their own story to tell and each one faces issues and a lot of them are things that we don't really see much in anything. For example me personally I've never seen a character in anything with as much dialog as Linus does who is homeless. I mean that for me is one of the bigger ones that stuck out where I was like oh that's really cool actually. Along with all of the amazing writing and gameplay, I think how the game works is very well. It is pretty simple and it is really easy to learn. For some people who play more mellow games like this the fighting aspect can be very hard for them. However I really don't think that even the fighting in this game is that hard. It is pretty simple and it makes it very easy to learn. I think the hardest thing for me to learn was how to fish. For me it took a while to figure that. But in general all I can say is just play it. Even if you don't get far in the game it is still a fun time to experience the game itself."
29068,"i keep mining,farming,fishing until i pass out
"
29069,Fun and casual farming simulation with mining and crafting and interactions with villagers. All optional and lots of options for custom decorations or challenges. Almost any play style has something to enjoy.
29070,One of my favorite games to play. I rarely get bored when playing because there are so many things you can do.
29071,It good
29072,"One of a kind game, and now it has multiplayer. Ideal to play with close friends and have fun watching them take their own decisions. Music is 10/10, it just starts kinda slow and it's hard to give a meaning to the game more than making tons of money."
29073,"I have 34 tabs open at once just for this game.
This game inspired me to start making games myself. It's just that good."
29074,ooga booga seeds ground me pretty vegatebles Mhmmm yes tasty very indeed. play good friends with
29075,good game farm heal sad
29076,"My first gaming experience, and it is awesome! I started on the tablet (Android), which is slightly scaled down and very modified for Stardew Valley, borderline enabling (HA!).  The tablet is great for people who have limited mobility.  I just switched to the computer so I could play the full version.  

I use an XBox Gaming controller in my left hand for the joy stick.   I had to relearn combat once I switched to the computer as the tablet assists you quite a bit.  Once I figured it out, my skills began to improve.  On both the tablet and the computer version fishing is hard, no sure if it is because I use a controller and not a mouse.  I took at least 2 seasons off from farming to learn how to fish.  It was really hard on the controller!  The fish moves up and down on the bar, but the controller can only go up.  You can attach a lead tackle to keep it from bouncing so much, eat the soup Willy sells and go on a good luck day.  I have caught one legend fish on one of my 3 played games, in the sewers.  I have caught and purchased the sturgeon.  I have caught all the fish for the community center except the catfish because I've been enabled by Linus, and the Puffer Fish (sold on the traveling cart).  

I've added a few mods once I switched to the computer.  One helps by showing if the animals have been petted, it also shows who is having a birthday that day and if it will be good luck or bad. My son had to help with this, and I was impressed by his file management skills.  I'm off to find the tractor mod.  May you all have a good luck day!"
29077,yes
29078,"This game is a masterpiece created by one single person, Eric Barone (ConcernedApe). All gameplay elements (farming, fishing, foraging, mining, and combat) are well balanced and you get to choose how you want to play the game by selecting specific buffs. It provides an open-world like experience in a limited area. You have the freedom to plan your days, choose how you interact with certain NPC's and trigger lots of events. There is much to discover in the valley! The thing that I like the most is there are very few ""points of no return"" in the game. Many ""choices"" are reversible by various interactions in the game (wedding, forgetting divorce, buff selection etc.)"
29079,I think Stardew Valley is the most wholesome game of all time. I just sit there and smile..
29080,"y3s
"
29081,What a amazing game 10/10 when i got this game i no joke played for 5 hours a day but the sad thing is i downloaded smapi which is a modding tool and i downloaded a mod for hacks and that just ruined the experience as there was not point in grinding for money as i could just spawn it in so if your buying this game or any other game i highly recommend that you dont install hacks as there is no incentive to play the game when you can spawn anything you want in
29082,"6 years ago, when I was a kid who really like a simulator game such as Harvest Moon, Pokémon, and I used to play Minecraft with my friends. I also remember buying this game on my pc. My computer was old and slow at the time, and I couldn't play many games because of it, but there was one game that I could enjoy without worrying about my frame rate. This game called Stardew Valley. It is a farming simulation game that can run on any pc. I have a lot of fun playing it from time to time. Harvest Moon inspired Stardew Valley, which is why several of the mechanics are similar. What’s make Stardew Valley unique is the story of this game, each of the game's Npcs has their own backstory. You can also flirt with Npcs whose names have a single next to them. In this game, you have a lot of options. There are 4 seasons on this game, each season have different seeds to plant and when the game changes the season the previous season seeds won’t be able to survive and died. So, you must manage your see growth time to not make it grow before the game changes the season. Also, you can explore the town and you can choose the way how the story goes. The Npc in this town has their own like and don’t like, it may be a food or things depends on that person. I know some of you guys might feel bored from playing alone. They updated the game that you can play with your friends now. So, you won’t feel bored playing by yourself now. This is a game that I recommend you play. I’m sure you will not be disappointed. Hope you can decide it after read my review. Thank you for reading my review."
29083,Very fun game. i like how its a huge time passer and is never not fun to play. there's fun stuff to do every season
29084,a litle grindy but fun
29085,its a good game to sit done ande relecs
29086,"good
"
29087,Its a really calm game that can be really nice since it requires alot of time management to manage your crops and your well time. It also sends you into this world without instructions most of the time which makes the experience alot more fun to understand and figure out how this game work but for people who are much more intrested in FPS rather then Social games or Calming games I would not suggest it but it is an amazing game overall
29088,Yeah reminds me of Fortnite
29089,OK
29090,nice very addictive
29091,verry good game its good cus its just holsom fun

29111,Fun farming game!!!
29112,get gud
29113,this games is goosd
29114,"Pretty much a classic at this point, this game blends the concept of farm management and relationship sim together wonderfully. And with near seamless mod support, if there were a few things that needed tweaking then it's there for you. I especially love being able to just pick up the game and hop in, no pressure or stress, very relaxing and a good in between when playing more demanding games."
29115,An absolute blast to spend time with friends and great to just relax for an evening!
29116,sooooooo slay the most slay of all the slays and it slays so much yas

29119,good soup
29120,"If you like laid-back games, want something to pass the time with, and if you possibly have friends to play some co-op?! (no way), this game is actually for you. Super fun so far, and I can tell it's well polished and crafted with its light charm."

29137,"Stardew Valley is a throw back to my teenage years of 8 bits games, but with a modern twist.  A modern-day love story to games of old, you can tell that the designer has poured themselves into the game.  I like that their are lots of things to do, and that's it is not just an endless farming game.  I've been enjoying it so far, and my favorite part is of course my farm cat, Brownie.  You'd understand if you knew... felines are my one weakness.  I'm still learning how to play, and haven't quite caught onto how to fish.  I do wish there was a bit more of a walk-through and guidance on how to play the game, but I am hoping to catch on without resorting to looking up answers online.

How I got here...
I saw Claire Siobhan play this game on her channel.  I've never really watched a gaming You Tuber before, but I enjoy her upbeat and quirky humor.  I have been going back to see some of her other games she's played through other than Sims.  She likes supporting indie designers, and this is now the second game I've bought from Steam that she played and recommended."
29138,yeah its pretty alright
29139,"If you enjoy the Harvest Moon games you will like this. It is more encompassing and with the option for Mods it is, in my opinion, better. I am enjoying it a lot!"
29140,"I love this game so much; I literally can't say enough good things about it. First off, the fact that one man made this whole game is SO impressive. Secondly, I love the idea of a cute farm simulator game with friendships/love paths specific to each character in the game. Co-op is definitely a fun way to play as well! Linus is forever my favorite character, and Sebastian is my game husband. This game is absolutely worth every penny, and many MANY hours of game play :)"
29141,Beautiful!
29142,fun
29143,game good

29148,"Tried getting into this and did enjoy it, but I started my first play through out really wrong and was quickly unable to progress properly.  I will try again once I have time to go through my game back log and read a guide so I can get started properly with the game.  I think the friendship/relationship system with the NPCs is really intriguing."
29149,"There was a science experiment where I was forced people to play games non-stop. During 1983 I was forced to play this very exact game with no sleep for 3 long years.

When I was young there was a kid who bullied me called Clint, he threw rocks at me and one day he threw one so hard that my hand fell of. There is a Character in this game who has a likeness to Clint and happens to share his name. Playing this today gives me great fear."

29151,"This game reminds me of Moon Harvest, or Rune Factory 1 - 3 and is great for all ages!"
29152,This game is amazing! I have played the vanilla version and have now started to mod it. It add so much!
29153,beautiful amazing live laugh love
29154,A MA Z I NG
29155,this a banger lwk
29156,I like the farming
29157,fun game
29158,I find it to be an enjoyable game although it is not for everyone although I would recommend you would try it anyway though it's art style is very pleasing and the atmosphere of the game is hilarious and its very very fun ⭐Would recommend
29159,just a chill time..
29160,"A game with the soul of Harvest Moon, containing the heart (and spleen) of a creator that pulls you into a world you [b]want[/b] to know more about as you play. The comfort of repetition aside, with so much to work through (with handy checklists) you never feel it's a grind. Unless you work for Joja, you filthy capitalist.

That my 336 hours of entertainment have come from a SINGLE individual (lewd) is impressive. Adding to that, the community also pitches in for quality of life tweaks via mods; many of them being incorporated by the creator in later versions (he listens! he watches!). Be careful with your modding, though, or you'll lose that kind balance between a good gaming experience and ""press X to receive win scenario"", which takes all the fun out of getting there.

That being said, I will 100% this game. The last achievement will be siding with Joja Corporation. On a separate save. Which will be deleted after completion. Brrr..."
29161,"started playing three days ago, ruined my sleep schedule, would recommend,"
29162,f a r m
29163,Honestly this is the only game I play. I have found it to be so entertaining. When ever I am stressed I know that I can relax by playing Stardew Valley
29164,this game is better than an orxgasxm
29165,"One word, Emily."
29166,"c cупер 
но главное не заьбывайте читать рэп, не забывай откуда ты родом и главное ч тоб тебя не приняли каким ты неесть! бублики прям оч + в 18 лет нормалньо"
29167,"Super fun, laid back game with a surprising amount of strategy involved. Theres also no filter so you as a player are enabled to name your farm whatever sick, offensive name you'd like."
29168,GET IT
29169,Just be careful; you can lose months of real life on this game.
29170,"So I played X3 Farnham's Legacy recently, got frustrated after awhile. Played ONI before that, no frustrations but sort of run out of steam.

For Stardew Valley, I can always come back and whether I play to the end so to say or not, I am always in positive mood somehow. Never frustrated or bored. That's some rare quality in a game. That's like a happy place in your garden where you can just go and sit for awhile.

Many fancy 3D games take back seat in my collection as I play this one."
29171,Its amazing.
29172,"Super cute and fun! Becoming friends (and more) with the townspeople, all while keeping up with all my animals and farm, is such a mindless and relaxing game."
29173,You can have chickens )o)
29174,"Soundtrack is great, it's a very soothing game. Good with friends. Great fishing."
29175,"I loved this game, the music is great, maybe took me too long to get married. It took me forever to finish the bundles but stardew valley wiki helps a lot"
29176,Great game for relaxing time!
29177,fuck journey of the prairie king
29178,mastapiece
29179,played it during zoom school and is probably the main reason i didnt end it all during the pandemic. but now every time i hear the music i think of my french class. fuck you madame tubiana
29180,It's okay
29181,very calm fishing takes time to get good at it though there is so much to do i love the game it is very good hope any buyers like it to.
29182,"Harvest Moon GB, very first farm simulator I've played. That genre has come a long way. This game tugs on my heart strings of a 3x3 crop plot. But this is not that game. So much better! The depth, length and story is unequal. I can relate after working in a cubical and wanting to escape to a world where i can create and grow. Buy this game you will not be disappointed."
29183,Best Sim Game!
29184,A game which immerses you in the sounds of nature
29185,slay
29186,"Stardew Valley offers a lot of diverse options for incredibly chill gameplay experiences.  From growing, harvesting, and processing your own produce to hacking-and-slashing baddies in the mines, from fishing and foraging to immersing yourself in the stories of the townsfolk and wooing some of them along the way, Stardew Valley has it all.  While this game can be played with a posture toward minimizing resources (time, money, space) and maximizing profit, I think Stardew excels in allowing users to customize their games such that players can temper that posturing to whichever degree a user prefers with diversified options and sheer aesthetics.  If you're looking for a game to distract you from the suffocating day-to-day within your life, then the Valley is calling out for you."
29187,Play 'dis one. Is good.
29188,fun until u find the dark secrets of the valley
29189,"This game is very fun with various paths you can take in ""life"" and with what seems like endless adventures"
29190,mid
29191,"świetna gra, po zagraniu pojawił się u mnie fetysz starszych mężczyzn. linus i george <3"
29192,"Not usually my type of game, but I've really enjoyed it so far and expect I'll put hundred+ hours into it.  Great, chill game to pass some time with!

Update: 80 hours now and I started making a guide... which is a sign that I am really enjoying a game."
29193,I really like all of the aspects of this game combined.
29194,good game
29195,valid
29196,"A great game if you have Anxiety! a Super Relaxing game with a Adorable Community with characters with their own Personalities and families, You'll fall in love with this game if you want to play something Fun, Casual, and relaxing without any kind of Consequences or scary Things happen and LOVE animals as much as I do! The Graphics are Nice and have Wonderful little Pixels to highlight every little Detail and Funky Animal Characters that Talk! Of course theres still a Battle Mechanic and Dungeons involved if you get bored of just being a normal farmer, now you can be a farmer and an Adventurer!"
29197,"DUDE IVE BEEN PLAYING FOR LEGIT THE PAST WEEK EVERYDAY, just because it's super entertaining  and there's always more to do in the game :)"
29198,Fun and calming :))

29205,"there's so much I love about the game that I don't wanna even bother starting on about, so I'll just say what I don't like. While there's a lot of content in the game, it's not uncommon that you need the wiki to find out how to do something and if you don't then you'll start to feel stuck, especially  once you get to Ginger Island. Other than that it's pretty awesome and I would def recommend buying it."
29206,GuD

"
29233,nice.

29250,"This game seems to be a very normal farming sim, but as you play more and more, you will discover the secrets that lie in Pelican Town"
29251,...
29252,"It's a very chill and fun game! I love the interactions with the villagers, my only problem with it is after you romance the characters, a majority of them kind of lose their personalities. It would be probably impossible but it would be nice if the NPCs could aid you in mines or at least sometimes be there so you have a sense of company? Overall a very fun game!"
29253,"WOW I LOVE SEBASTIAN MEOWZAAA, THIS GAME IS ALSO WAY TO ADDICTING"
29254,this game is addicting! Always something to do to keep me busy.
29255,bery niceu
29256,"You can play this like a min-max pro or you can just go fishing, plant some seeds and woo the girl of your fancy."
29257,I highly recommend that you click on the concernedape logo when you're first starting the game.
29258,im not addicted i swear
29259,"Hi this is Diane Buckthorpe, mother of 3 rascals and lovely wife of the handsome stud Jack Buckthorpe an I am here to warn all about the dangers of this horrendous pixel on screen displaying program!!! I caught my oldest munchkin engaging in terrible northern pike slander!!! As soon as he started the program it displayed terrible propaganda promoting the northern pike farming industry and ever since he just hasn't been the same. On our family risk global domination night he refused to ally with Ruby my shining angel and proceeded to pillage her terroritory in northern Alaska!!! I couldn't bare to witness such a heinous act from my little archie and was forced to blind myself with the family relic flashjlight which has been apart of the buckingham legacy since we first developed risk global domination!!! Great game love it!!!"

29261,Is very fun and addicting! I have played 239 hours and my Mother has over 4k hours.

29267,I love this game! I can marry the girl of my dreams and harass my least favorite people.
29268,Love this game but there is so much quality of life mods that could be added in the base game
29269,good
29270,"best gam

29290,its fun
29291,its ok i guess
29292,"Very complex, but very peaceful. 10/10"
29293,"Stardew Valley has created some of my favorite video game memories, ever. I can't praise enough the feeling you get from playing this game with a friend or friends late at night in the summertime. Such an incredibly charming game with such a relaxing atmosphere. Far more than just a farming sim, absolutely everything in Stardew is beyond addicting: fishing, mining, decorating, gifting, exploring, cooking, it's all so calming and satisfying. The OST and visuals breathe life into every moment of gameplay, interacting with the NPCs is a delight, and pretty much every Stardew Valley devotee will admit to how much time they've spent on the wiki, desperate to research exactly what they can accomplish before the season ends. Even if you have no interest in farming games, I highly recommend trying out Stardew with a friend, it's a challenge not to get hooked."
29294,funky farming
29295,"good, fun, enjoyable recommend"
29296,"167 hours that I will never get back, because I don't want to. The game is great."
29297,"This game is the ultimate in good vibes. If you want to play alone, all good. If you want to play with friends, even better! I would recommend this game for literally everyone. It's obviously a passion project and the developer took time to guarantee you have a good experience."
29298,woAH pixel
29299,I aspire to be more like the person who made this game. Not that I know anything about them other than the game they have created.
29300,"Stardew Valley is just an overall awesome game. It's a really cute and fun game, and is totally worth the money. There's a lot of content and a lot of different ways to play. I love this game because you can play it several times, and it's still fun each and every time. It's fun to play with others or by yourself! Overall, wonderful game."
29301,good game
29302,heehoo foraging go brrrr
29303,I love the relaxed atmosphere of the game. I also love that there is a ton of things you can do in the game from farming and fishing to starting a family and getting to know the villagers. Overall one of my all time favorite games!
29304,amazing game
29305,"You either hate this game, or you love it. This game is very simple but also kinda scary if you stay up to late."

29307,"Hilltop farm is op.  Get it homies, isa good game."
29308,Great game!!!
29309,"IT GOOD
"
29310,"I like this game, it's neat."
29311,"It's a great game. Lots of fun to play with friends! I enjoy playing it as it's a very chilled out game. There's always something to do, so you never feel bored or wonder what to do. It's the type of game where you go, ""just one more day..."" and end up playing for a couple more hours. Storyline keeps the game engaging too! 10/10"
29312,harvey <3
29313,A lovely way to spend some time when you need to distract from daily life and just chill out a bit!
29314,it fun
29315,"This game is so good. Its one of the only games I have bought multiple times. I own it on my phone as well. Its relaxing, fun with friends and really in depth with the townsfolk. I cannot stress how good this game really is. My only regret is waiting so long to buy it."
29316,"very gud
"
29317,Relaxing farm game and has good modding compatibility.
29318,"I love stardew valley so much! it is a game you can come back to over and over. There is so much to do and it is SO MUCH FUN!!! The NPCs are great but you dont have to interact with them and I love the choice. You could absolutely not talk to certain NPCs for the entire time you're playing and it would fundamentally affect your game play. I LOVE that fact that you have so much of a choice. Even if your choices boil down to farming, mining, fishing, talking, or exploring, there are so many ways to go about it!!! I love stardew valley so much I got it on Steam after having around 200 hours on my Nintendo Switch. AHHH I LOVE STARDEW VALLEY <3 <3"
29319,The perfect game in my opinion. Always keeps you busy and always fun.
29320,Lovely game!
29321,"unbothered, moisturized, happy, in my own lane, focused, flourishing."
29322,stardew <3
29323,"I really liked how you're free and open with all the things you can do in the game. There's a lot of things you can explore and see, make new friends, get married, etc,..."
29324,love this game :D
29325,"This is a very charming game with fun farming and ranching mechanics, and a nice bit of crafting, dungeon-delving and friendship/exploration to go with it. It took me 2 tries or so to get into it, though I did have other games to distract me then, but now I'm really enjoying myself. I'm only just getting to the end of my first winter, but I can easily see sinking another couple dozen hours into this game. Plus, knowing that there's technically no end, and thus no deadline (other than getting money to get through winter and buy crops each season) makes it easy for me to do what I want and not feel pressured!"
29326,"I am the type of person who likes a little bit of everything in my games. If i want to adventure, I can. If i want to start a family, I can. If i want to stay at home and farm to my hearts content, I can. The only thing i dislike about this game is that there isnt a version with better pixilation/graphics or fpv. Thats it. I know there are other games out there to scratch that itch, but this game is practically flawless. Especially with how easy it is to mod the  game to how you like it. I can make the game exactly how i want it at any given moment, or reverse it if it isnt behaving how i want it to. Thank you ConcernedApe for this blessing of a game. You are truly a pioneer for games like this."
29327,This game is truely amazing! All of my 400 hours ive spent playing this game have been nothing short of specticular. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who has 15 pounds
29328,i want to rape lewis and is soggy boy pussy
29329,I don't think I need to say anything. It's perfect.
29330,pretty cool game 10/10

29333, Such an amazing game! Really helped me in calming down after a stressful day
29334,"very simplistic game, fun alone or with friends"
29335,LOVE the game
29336,This is so well made and relaxing and just super fun. I own it on every gaming device I have including my phone. I can't get enough. I even have the board game. I can't wait until he comes out with expansions for it.
29337,good silly little farming game. good silly little villagers. love.
29338,Fun and relaxing
29339,"It's a fun game with a lot to do when you have a lot of time to spend :D, I have no clue what they're called but those husk clay things in the mine are annoying as heck though, but the slimes are cute :'D"
29340,great game!
29341,this game helped me feel even more happier since i can have great quality fun time with my brother and i always miss hanging out with him and this game is great because we can play together <3 ^_^
29342,this game is awesome
29343,its good
29344,very nice to play when you have absolute hours of free time to spend making virtual people love you
29345,"One of the best cozy games around. It's charming, easy to play but with a lot of room for strategic optimization for those interested in it, and provides a decent amount of variety nestled snugly into a well-designed core gameplay loop. The characters and dialogue aren't exactly revelatory, but aside from that modest shortcoming, I'd heartily endorse this for anyone into comfortable routine-based simulator games."
29346,really good game but im a bit sad i cant play with my friends who are on xbox
29347,"Fun little de-stresser game! Music and ambientation is amazing
"
29348,Cures depression!
29349,Very chill game! I can't get enough of this relaxation XD
29350,good
29351,its so intresting
29352,I really enjoy the gameplay
29353,"Seriosly I've only played it for 105 minutes
and still don't know what the game is about"
29354,mm ..farm
29355,"Been playing this game for almost a year and I couldn't recommend it enough! Its not expensive, and there are so many things you can do: farming, mining, fishing, crafting. It's so easy to just play for hours and hours on accident, because of the stuff you can do in the game. As well, being able to have relationships, both friend and romantic, with the towns people is another nice part of the game. Also being able to have gay couples makes my heart melt."
29356,play this its fun
29357,tons of hours on different platforms and this game is amazing would recommend to any casual player and will play for many more hours.
29358,bongochill game really calms me from [b][i] THE L9 MISERY OF LEAGUE OF LEGENDS [/i][/b]

29363,"Such a relaxing and cute game. Love playing Co-op with my GF and solo play is fun too. Very highly recommend for anyone looking for an atmospheric and casual farming game.

Make sure to use the wiki as it has tons of useful info."
29364,this game sucks
29365,"Every time I play THE HIT GAME Stardew Valley I have an eargasm from the repetitive music, It’s just so beautiful I can’t help myself but cream a little. The scenery in it is amazing, the quest, the farm, the people, the stardrops…..are all amazing. If I could be in THE HIT GAME Stardew Valley I would, trust me. I just can’t help myself when it comes to that game it makes me tingle, cream and tremble under its sight, my thighs are literally quaking just from opening it right now in anticipation to play some more of THE HIT GAME Stardew Valley… I know others may judge me b….but I don’t care. I want to pass down this game from generation to generation, and let all my children experience the beauty of THE HIT GAME Stardew Valley. Right now as we speak I am creaming my pants to THE HIT GAME Stardew Valley. You just wouldn’t understand how I feel about this game, It’s like taking a bite out of that one good strawberry out of all of the strawberries in the container, so sweet….so so juicy…. The taste you know you won’t get again from all the other strawberries but it really stays with you and makes you feel good…..You couldn’t understand how I feel for THE HIT GAME Stardew Valley. and that’s fine I don’t expect you to."

29370,Grow melons.
29371,very entertaining and calming
29372,"Best money spent on game either. I like the fact that there is no goals/ aims in this game, making me less stress about achieving the goals. (You can still set the goal yourself and play). The only thing I dislike was there wasn't any starting tutorial. But, there are many guides on the internet, and I feel that it is advisable to read up before you started playing. I have made many rookie mistakes, and I felt that I had to restart my farm. Once you get the hang of it, stardew valley become the best relaxing game ever!"
29373,this game is fun. i normally play first person shooters or something and this game is a great break from that. just my opinion tho.

The game is so calming and relaxing from game-play mechanics to the story. for a 2D game you get so immersed. Everything is 10/10. Best Game to play with the lads. JUST PLAY IT STOP READING.

29431,"this game is amazing :3
a good friend recommended it and i love it"
29432,This game is adorable and playful but has some depth as you interact with the NPCs more. There is so much replay value and so much to discover.
29433,"just buy it

29434,.
29435,"f**k the corporate world, go live on a failing farm, get tired, get drunk, pass out in a cave, meet strangers, do some weird drugs with guy who thinks he's a wizard, wonder what was in that cause now the seed pod things are talking to you....wake up and do it again. 10/10 would recommend."
29436,"9/10

Make Willy romanceable, I want that sweet fisherman rod.

Great farming sim otherwise though, reminds me that I'll always be a disappointment to my grandparents, even from beyond the grave."

29439,"This is one of the few games i keep coming back to, i love Stardew Valley, I own it on almost every platform its available on. ConcernedApe you did a great job and I can't wait to get my hands on Haunted Chocolatier."

29447,"Very cute, lots of detail and a lot of good storylines."
29448,"I own this on both steam and the switch, with around 70 hours between the two. Coming from a background of Harvest Moon and Rune Factory, this scratches the farming sim itch while also introducing memorable characters who you really desire to get to know. 

10/10. Fishing is hard. Fishing gets easier."
29449,Very enjoyble and very calming.
29450,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
29451,corn
29452,"very good game but does get really addicting and will most likely take up a lot of your time without you realising other then that the season mechanic making you have to plant different crops depending on the season makes the game have more to do then just farming parsnips all game and the mines, enemies, birthdays, social mechanics, events and others makes the game very fun and more to do I would recommend this game 100% just make sure to not pour to much time into it :)"
29453,I thought minecarft was more 3D than this but still had a blast
29454,is good
29455,"farm, water, sleep, repeat untill you get to ancient fruit, then its just sleep and make cash money"

29461,A wonderful game!
29462,"Slowly but surely, I got addicted to this game. There are interesting NPC stories and quests related to them. Also, I love the collections and achievement system of the game. Maybe because I am hoarder deep down."
29463,"I always wanted to farm without having to do it actually.. this game lets me live vicariously through it.
 *chefs kiss*"
29464,I put my seed into the ground
29465,Crazy good
29466,I love the simplicity of the graphics and the relaxed game play. There are so many things to do and tasks to complete that you can easily spend countless hours just working on the farm and in the community. This is def worth playing for all ages!
29467,fire
29468,"It was really fun interacting with NPCs and growing crops with my friends <3

29473,"if you love farming simulation, you gotta love this."
29474,The game is fun and you can take different routs with your characters.
29475,"I have over 800 hours in this game across several platforms. ConcernedApe's open-minded stances and love for the project are so visible in everything about Stardew. It's an amazing game that pleases to most gamers with flooding amounts of charm, and always the one game me, my partner and my friends find ourselves coming back to whenever we want a stress-free quality time. Stardew Valley isn't just a timeless classic. it's also the best example of iyashikei ever made by someone who's not japanese."
29476,"[h1]Intro[/h1]
Stardew Valley…, for 6 years after the game was released I finally picked this up and now it is the time for review.

First off, I am not a fan of this genre at all, all I’ve ever played was FPS, MMORPG, Tower Defense and some others but not this kind. Ever. So it came as a surprise to me ever since the game was out, is this game good? Short answer, heck yeah! I don’t know why but I’ll try my best to explain to you why you may like this game.

[h1]Story[/h1]
So, what exactly is Stardew Valley? You are recently unemployed because you disliked your company and left. You found a letter left for you by grandpa who gave his old farm to you and wants you to revive the place back. An unemployed man has no choice and guess what? He decided to go and see the farm. Ha! Simple as that! Getting down from the bus you meet a run-down farm, it is now yours to revive and start a new life in the country.

[h1]Experience[/h1]
Now.. you have a lot to do, and I mean A LOT. Clearing out your farm because it is overrun with weed, start farming and make some money, getting to know villagers because it is good to have friends. And probably along the way find yourself a pretty wife and form a little happy family, sounds great! But if you try to do all that you will get exhausted for sure. Try to take it slow, relax and immerse yourself in daily farmer life. Learn what people do each day, find out what they like, catch some fish, try digging down the mine or take a day off and just walk around in town and talk to people.

The thing is, Stardew Valley is a game about exploration. Try walking that way and look around, you already discover new things. Wait until night and you see creatures running around. Finding out these unexpected secrets is what makes the game beautiful, and each time, makes it even more addicting.

[h1]Playing & Progress[/h1]
I have played this game for ~140 hrs and now at the end of year 3, I still have events I didn’t encounter, things I want to do in the game and I’m definitely willing to continue playing it. I can see now why people pour thousands of hours into this game. All the time you will find yourself listening to soothing music as you do your daily routine. People you talk to will eventually become closer friends and by doing that you might also solve some of their problems. It makes you attached to those people and feel a connection between you and them. The game will be fun to play and will always be.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
Multiplayer is what I didn’t touch on the most in this game, but from what I heard, you can play with your friends with shared assets and separate houses which sounds fun. If you have people to play with, Stardew Valley is good!

[h1]Remarks[/h1]
Stardew Valley earns a special place in my heart. Its relaxing and laid back nature separates itself from other games in the market. It is a game you can always come back and enjoy anytime. Even if you are not into this genre the same as me, maybe you will find yourself mesmerized after you try."
29477,"I resisted this game for years.  Knew how I was with Harvest Moon, could absolutely lose myself in farming sims. 

Stardew is 100000x better. This game is my happy place.  If you like mods, there are hundreds; every game can be different.  You can play with friends, or solo; you can be the hero, make everyone hate you, fish, never fish, do nothing but farming or everything but farming.  I cannot simply express in words how much this game has improved my quality of life just by existing.

So thanks, ConcernedApe.  You made my life better with pixels."
29478,i can wear trash can and pet dog
29479,just....okay?!?????
29480,Very relaxing.
29481,Yes
29482,i love this game a lot
29483,"Such a great game, perfect if you want to get into farming sims. Super cozy and full of hidden surprises."
29484,tbh is kinda addicting its hard to stop playing it hahah ♥
29485,chill game
29486,Loved it <3
29487,good game it replaced my life
29488,Stardew Valley
29489,legit amazing omg. nothing wrong w it but it would be better if you could give people presents multiple times a week instead of just 2.
29490,"I got it on Switch initially after a friend told me about it. I absolutely loved it so I also got it for PC. The only flaws it has is that:
- Once you're asked if you want the pet and you say no, you never get that chance again. (I refuse to say no.)
- I want to have both a cat and a dog in the same save at the same time. :(
- I find it hard to choose who to marry but I feel that's one of the (many) things gives it replay value... unless I'd want to pay for a divorce then remarry but I simply can't. (I have a soft spot for Elliott personally.)"
29491,i love the pvp
29492,Fun and relaxing ♥
29493,Amazing farming game that spawns so many other games like it
29494,"You are a villager in Stardew Valley. You approach your hangout spot by the sea, and find the new farmer. He has been fishing for 10 hours. He pauses to horf down 4 pieces of raw seaweed. He notices you, and gifts you an uncooked egg from his pocket. Your fondness for him grows."
29495,"this is a good game.

i like"
29498,I love it get it now
29499,Not my cup of tea but still-it's really cute. I'd recommend it if you are into casual games like animal crossing for instance. The art style and the world building are really nice actually. I just don't like the way the game saves progress and i really struggled with the lack of instructions.
29500,yes sir
29501,Fucking Amazing
29502,relaxing
29503,"Stardew Valley is such an incredibly fun and relaxing game. You get to be creative while also befriending unique and interesting NPCs and learn their story and who they are and used to be. The in-game music is also just as beautiful. There's always something for you to do and you can never be bored or goalless in this game, I love it."
29504,"Awesome farming game. For a beginner, it can be incredibly confusing or even seem underwhelming, but there's actually a LOT of content in the game - it's just a little difficult to look for it (hint: don't ignore the quests you get in the mail) Overall, you can get hundreds of hours of fun out of it, and it's hard to get bored since there's always more to do. It can get a little repetitive once you're in the endgame, though, but you can always take it from the top"
29505,Love it <3
29506,Cool
29507,:)
29508,"Best game

29514,chickens :D
29515,"Action-packed, gore-filled, packed with suspense! Best game I've ever played, 10/10 would kill again."
29516,This game is not Among Us.
29517,😍
29518,Not sure how I'll ever be able to explain to others the joy that being a virtual farmer brought me but I loved each and every second I spent playing this game. Ridiculously fun time overall. 10/10.

29528,Very good game that works as a nice form of catharsis.
29529,"A wonderful, relaxing game. My girlfriend and I love playing it together."
29530,Very relaxing farming sim. Everything in this game feels as if it is designed to just help you wind down and enjoy the peaceful environment.
29531,Just all around fun and cute
29532,"This has genuinely been one of my favorite games I have ever played. I get bored very quickly and very easily, so the fact that as you start feeling as though it doesn't have much more to add, you find that there is more and more that you can do. I have this game on both PC, switch, and even Xbox, and I love all of them, but I have put a lot more time into it on PC. Long story short, this is by far my favorite game basically ever."
29533,Fun so munch stuff to do its a long game  you should give it a try
29534,YES
29535,FANTASTIC GAME I HATCHED CHICKENS
29536,Very relaxing game I have a blueberry wine farm
29537,"Solid game but, don't ever not do communism when your playing with friends. It'll take a second to get enough money but it's worth it I swear."
29538,oddly fun passes the time when you're bored
29539,Good. Play this.
29540,its great
29541,"Lots of content, many hours of fun."

29551,pog game
29552,"I love how wholesome and fun the game is.  It seems like the creator made it as a homeage to the Harvest Moon game series, but Stardew Valley is even better."
29553,Absolutely terrible kill me now
29554,It is a fun game.
29555,farm game make the happy chemicals go woo
29556,I never liked video games at all but this is what i've always wantd in a game!

29560,This game is so cozy and relaxing and has just the right amount of challenge. I recommend it to everyone i know. Its an absolute favorite.
29561,"This game has, at times, swallowed me whole, for days. If I'm the reason you start playing, blow a kiss to Emily for me."
29562,"mmm crops very nice :) sometimes magic, also very nice and cool 100/10 goty"
29563,"Great farming game. Perfect for co-op too
"
29564,star vall
29565,This game is pretty cool.  I am glad it gives me time to develop my character. I would recommend this game for sure!!
29566,"Deceptively simple game, but lots of complexity and depth. Do not play if you value your free time, lol!"
29567,Chimken :)
29568,"It's a fun but depressing game, since real life can't be this easy."
29569,"Great game, give it a go."
29570,"I literally fell in love with this game a little more than a year ago. 
And with nearly 1000 hours of gameplay I still never reached late game and still learn new things (but i'm a serial restarter)
Whatever your style  from casual to speedrun/min-max, you can play at your own pace with your own rules without being punished for it. (Even if... I admit the day is short... really short... except maybe in winter)
On top of it there is a HUGE and sweet community. Maybe the most inclusive and kind to help and share I never met sharing thousands of hours of content. 
And when you're feeling burned-out. A little layer of modding will refresh your experience. 
A must to try and really more than a farming simulator."
29571,"not sure why so many modern games are basically chore simulators, but as they go this is a diverting one"
29572,game so cool
29573,"This game is so fun to relax back and farm, if you loved farmville try it for yourself."
29574,"A nice game. 
Apart from the obvious part which is tending your farm and making money, the game has various interesting sides like the different events, the chats and cut-scenes with the villagers which are getting even more interesting each time you gain friendship level, the cave exploration, the ability to travel to different places, construct various buildings. There are a lot of stuff you can do in the game and you can do them at your own pace! I like the fact that they put some ""mystery"" in the script too. I believe it is a calm and fun game to play and I would undoubtedly recommend it."
29575,yeah
29576,groovy
29577,"I quite liked this game. I haven't finished it yet, simply because it's tedious and frankly a bit boring sometimes. It's a fun game, though, and I recommend buying it.

The music and art are gorgeous, and the NPCs, although repetitive in terms of dialogue, are nice enough and you really care about them after a few cutscenes. 

It also has some downsides, though. Most notably, as many have said, the social mechanic is crap, it's tedious and boring, and the lack of things that can go wrong is irritating. The latter is manageable for me, though, because I'm not playing it to beat it, or be a gamer, you know? I'm playing to be a farmer, raise some goats, and live my life surrounded by numerous friends!

Despite the downsides, it's a pretty good game, really relaxing. I totally think you should buy it, and if you're reading reviews instead of forking over your fourteen dollars, cut it out, buy the game, and get some goats for me."
29578,"This is great game to farm however you want, and to hangout with the towns people. I enjoyed the cute moments in the town."
29579,One of the best games! <3
29580,cewl
29581,"Great game, I became brain dead after covid and this game vibes with me"

29589,Apple you were so right
29590,Perfection!
29591,I'd say it's extremely awesome. But of course that's my personal opinion since I like this kind of gaming.
29592,= )
29593,>:)
29594,I LIKE FARMING YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
29595,"This is actually the second time I've bought this game. I bought it for the PS4 about three years ago, and once I got a gaming PC I just had to buy it again. 

I LOVE this game from the depths of my heart. The social aspect is pretty basic, but there's SO MUCH TO DO. Want to specialize in crops, go ahead. Want to exclusively mine, sure thing. Do you want to make a fishing empire (bless your soul), you can do it. Five playthroughs in, and I'm still loving every moment of this game. 

If you're brave enough to try modding your game, the modding community is absolutely fantastic for this game and can open up EVEN MORE things for you to do and explore. 

20/10 would and have recommended this game to anyone and everyone!"
29596,I have too many hours in this game.
29597,"This game is a lot of fun, it's a nice calm relaxing game. Plus with the Jean and Jorts mod it's even better."
29598,This a good game if you like farming and the story line isn't being thrown at you every second so you have time to farm and do whatever you would like to! I 100% recommend this game.
29599,This game is a modern classic at this point
29600,"love this game, really enjoy playing it w my best friend <3"
29601,yes :thumbsup:
29602,bloody lovely
29603,Games is very fun and i would recommend to anyone
29604,i really do like playing harvest moon back then either in gba advance or nintendo ds but i never finish the game nor even get into a full cycle of season but i did in this stardew valley. got married and making more money now i guess also being friendly with all the npc... maybe not all npc. xP
29605,best game ever.
29606,"just look at my playtime and youll know all that you need to :D
(also if you ever get bored of the base game like i was finally starting to, theres always the mods to check out! definitely make it feel like a whole new game)"
29607,its good game
29608,vvhgvhgvhjvgvkugvuguvgv
29609,it's more fun to play with friends
29610,"Fucking love this game. Best as multiplayer, but solo is still pretty good."
29611,great
29612,"Picked up this game just to pass some time, expecting it to be your average farming sim with some cute pixel art. What I wasn't expecting (and I'm incredibly happy for), was it being a farming sim, dungeon crawler and the Sims wrapped into one. It's incredibly satisfying getting the upgrades. Everything feels worth it and rewarding. The townsfolk are surprisingly in depth (yes, there's some repeating lines, but still so worth it to talk to them/give the gifts). Not to mention, there's so many secrets to reveal and new places to go to. I can't wait to get to the next area. 

Highly recommend this one! I've lost a lot more hours to this than I thought I would lol!"
29613,Loads of fun
29614,"I LOVE THIS GAME-
I will say, it took me a while to figure out, but once I got immersed its genuinely one of my all time favorites. I would highly recommend watching a youtube tutorial on it before starting, just so you have a bit more background on how things work- If you are ever confused about anything, the wiki is your best friend as well.
The characters are wonderful, the game design is gorgeous, this is one of the few games I can play for hours and hours and hours without reaching a point of boredom.
TLDR: Amazing game, just be sure to look for outside resources if you are confused (Don't give up on it!)"
29615,Great game of the farming variety and very peaceful. Best played with others but still great alone
29616,"I enjoy grinding on farming, fishing, and mining. What's fun about the game to me is building resources from television, valley friends, and shopkeepers. I would love to get the hang on doing this on my own, I highly recommend playing with friends while grinding yourself. Currency is shared, it's very easy for me to enjoy building currency because of the people and seeing cut scenes when I enter areas... it happens randomly fyi!"
29617,Comfy game 10/10
29618,İ think the best farming game ever
29619,this game is great
29620,"This game heals me from the hurt that Battlefield 1 inflicts upon me, modding is fantastic for freshening the experience and I could not recommend this game enough."
29621,"The village is a cult and now I'm a part of it. Never looked back since. 
PS delete Haley"
29622,"Literally my favorite game in the world! Perfect for people who aren't great at ""normal"" video games, but not too easy that you get bored too fast. There's so many facets to this game, I've played over 2,000 hours and own it on every platform. Perfect xmas /birthday gift too <3"
29623,so fun very good
29624,da game is good! Thumbs up from me!!!
29625,i sold my soul for this game and devoted my entire life in it :D
29626,I really enjoy playing this game! the story line is entertaining and I appreciate the  co-op option.
29627,perfect game i love
29628,very
29629,"It's fun cause this game actually has more than meet the eyes.
Despite an okay visual and inevitable repetitive tasks, there are many hidden things if you know where to look.
Please know that you will spend hours progressing so be sure to use guidelines on website, it's useful and will take you forward in game.
Enjoy the game!"
29630,good
29631,"homeless linus tech tips is best video game character don't @ me
"
29632,"This game has a lot of different aspects to it, such as the obvious farming and gathering materials, but there's also a bit you wouldn't normally expect in a farming simulator, AKA combat and mining. Stardew Valley has such a wide aspect to it that within 3 days i got 53 hours! I simply cannot stop playing! I definitely recommend Stardew Valley to anyone looking for a new game to play."
29633,I dated a woman (and a guy lol)
29634,"for all the women reading this.
if you get your boyfriend to play this, i cant stress it enough, its the perfect game to boss him around in. ctfu"
29635,"The game is very cute, and I personally find it a great way to wind down. There is plenty to do. There is adventure as well as the elements of a simulator game. The game has many elements that you can master. It has multi-player compatibility, which is a great way to chill with friends. There is always more to do, and with countless combinations of spouses and farms, there is a lot of replayability."
29636,"Simple, Nostalgic, Oldskool but Amazing. You can easily play this game without noticing that time flies around you. After playing on the mobile version, now i bought the steam version. :)"
29637,"This is one of the best games, the creator is genuinely passionate about it and it shows. The level of detail, the amount of replay-ability. It's just so comforting to come back to Stardew. The soundtrack is fabulous, the depth of the story is fantastic, the different paths to take is so nice."
29638,Very fun game
29639,dsa
29640,all i can say is its kinda addiction if you actually sit down and play for more than a day
29641,"Stardew is probably the number 1 game I recommend to everyone. Whether you're a solid gamer or just a casual gamer, it's a great game. It's relaxing, peaceful, and with the added co-op version makes a great time waster with friends. I've played over 400 hours of Stardew on my switch and then realized I can play with mod's on my PC. Here's to another 400!"
29642,"Pro:
-NPC interactions are great
-Farming is excellent
-Building and skill upgrades are well paced
-Combat is enjoyable and intuitive
-Just a fun chill game solo or with friends

Con:
- Some map sections feel empty/unfinished

Summary:  If you play harvest moon you will enjoy this. Worth paying full price for this one.  Great chill time sink."
29643,"If you're looking for a review on this game, you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe, you've come to the right place. 😏

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
29644,Very fun game with lots of gameplay

If you like farming, gathering, mining, running small errands, and much more this game is for you. Like a lower graphic Harvest Moon, and Concerned Ape is always coming up with something new!"

29659,"This is a game that I truly enjoyed. In about 3 months I acquired about 140 hours of play time. I truly loved the different farms a player could have as well as all the different buildings, animals, and plants you could have. The little chicks are so cute! 
I also loved how much you could explore around the Valley. There are a lot of challenges and a lot of quest, and for a very long time, it does not get boring. 
However once you are finished with the Community Centre and the first set of mines, it starts becoming boring as well as expensive to do a lot do the other challenges and quests. 
On top of this the years become very repetitive with barely any change. Right now I am on my fifth year and I am stuck on the island trying to find golden walnuts. 
I just finished my fourth winter which was quite boring as there are no plants to plant really, I’ve caught most of the fish, and my farm is finished. I don’t want to spend 1000 gold to go to the island or desert everyday, especially if I die in the mines I lose more gold as well as my stuff. 
The romance and friends in the game are very cute though, but once you are married and have children there isn’t much to do with the spouse or children. Life kind of becomes a standstill. 
One thing that has really bothered me is how hard it is to marry my real life partner in this game. The items I need are incredibly rare and very dangerous to get. It almost doesn’t make it worth it, nor do I understand why it is this difficult. 
I do plan on starting a new farm soon, but I am not sure I want to restart everything. I tried coming back to the game a few months of no play, but I find it kind of boring now. 
I wish there was more to do and there weren’t so many risks as well as expenses."
29660,good times
29661,Garbage Game don't buy

29674,Yeah this is awesome! Legit none of my time was AFK
29675,yes
29676,"Stardew Valley is a fun little farm game with plenty of interesting plots woven into each of the characters. The controls are relatively easy to figure out (except for fishing. I'm really bad at fishing). Top recommendation: play with a friend. It's a game designed to play with friends, and the recent updates make it all the more enjoyable for co-op play. 9/10 game and definitely worth the money you pay for it."
29677,"Amazing game, music reminds me of Minecraft, relaxing and good pace. Love playing this after I finish studying or when I come home from the gym, or a long day at work. A gentle change of pace and keeps me engaged with it's relatively simple mechanics. Fishing is difficult at the start but they have a solution for that, the training rod, which makes fishing more enjoyable and prevents you from getting as frustrated.

Overall amazing game. Stardew Valley is on par if not better than Minecraft and Terraria for games I want to spend hours playing."

29692,Very fun game to play
29693,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.

The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.

A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.

The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.

However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.

Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.

It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.

In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.

Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.

When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.

Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.

Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.

If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.

For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.

For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.

They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.

The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.

A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted

A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.

This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.

The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.

A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower."
29694,"It's a lovely game. At the point where I achieved almost everything I wanted to achieve came the expansion with the island. Soothing music, great character, (almost) endless possibilities - a great game for everyone who wants to come home in the evening and enjoy his/ her little digital farm live. Have fun :)"

29700,"At first, I was reluctant to try this game out I was afraid that it was going to be a boring animal crossing (It's just my opinion if you like it that's perfectly fine) sort of game but now after playing this for a while, and becoming extremely invested in the characters, story-line, how much stuff there is to do and see. I can safely say that Stardew Valley has become one of my favorite games to play on a daily basis, I also love the fact that you can romance characters and how each of them has their own personality."
29701,"Peaceful, fun relaxing game!"
29702,Not harvest moon. Rather Harvest Moon as it should have been.

29717,i love playing this game with my amazing gf <3
29718,"Fun game, very remenicent of the Harvest Moon/Story Of Seasons series but it manages to stay different enough to keep your interest.

The characters are loveable and I find myself growing attached to all of them very quickly every time I play.

The controls could be a little easier - I find how finicky it is to ensure you're looking the right direction while using a tool, or are in the exact right position for the spot you want to do something tends to be a bit annoying. 
It would also be awesome if you didn't need to install mods to simply see where your neighbours are at any given time.

Overall, I would rate Stardew Valley a 4/5. 
It's a great game and I'm happy to have bought it (I mainly play it on my Nintendo Switch).
Def not for everyone, but anyone who enjoys classic farming/life sims like Harvest Moon or enjoys classic RPG style but doesn't want to be a 'hero' in every single game should buy this - it's a good, cozy classic to have in your collection."

There's just so much to do. I'll always come back to it after having a break from it and start a new game, already feeling stressed when I leave the house seeing all the trees, weeds, rocks, and logs right outside."

Stardew is the sort of game, where you start playing it at 11pm and then you first stop at 4 in the morning. It is a very calming game with quite the expansive story and many small easter-eggs. Concerned Ape (the creator) has made something amazing with his ""one man crew"". The mixture of a fun entertaining storyline, mindless grinding, simping for the villagers, and an amazing soundtrack combines to the game, which can be played anywhere. 
All in all a lot of fun, and you can always create a farm with a friend."

29741,"(Still good game, just work on it.)

BUG. Watering can vanishing.

Did not pass out or be knocked out in mine.
Not in ANY chests. Checked ALL of them day after day. 
Let weeks pass to see if game could register watering can as missing. It doesn't.
Never shows up in Lost and Found box.
I guess it's too early to try the Adventurer's Guild, since there's no option for the item's retrieval. (Because of that possibility no way to prove or disprove if it works or not.)

So, it's just gone. Guess the game THINKS it still exists, but it doesn't.

The community was great trolling me for the spelling of one word. Added one too many o's which could happen by rushing or a simple oversight since I was stressed out. 
So, y'know. Great community. Don't try to help anyone, but comment anyway. 'Cause I want that attention.

Someone gave me a good possible idea of use ""cheats"" to get it back. Wish they emphasized on that because I have no idea what they meant. And trying to search and search on it left me fruitless. 
One possibility was to have a tool ""item code"", great, but apparently those don't exist, so I can't find them anywhere. 
You can have weeds, miscellaneous items that I don't wanna list, and weeds. Lots of different codes for weeds.

So, you can edit a save file and add a watering can? And how? Because I don't know. I know how to do money, if you want to cheat yourself rich. I don't.
I don't know how to add a watering can to my inventory, which is all I want.
I don't know if I need a non-existent item code.
It's great to search and to stress about how to fix a bug that can just happen randomly to wipe one of your tools away, with no way to be able to get a replacement tool just in case. That there's no way to fix it and no one to help. Because they may also not know what to do.

This was a bit of a rant.. sorry. But sometimes you need an outlet. Still recommended, it's a good game. But to have something like this, something completely avoidable. It's ridiculous and unnecessary and completely preventable by just being able to purchase a lost tool.
Worst thing is have two tools. And that's not bad at all."

29766,"Base storyline is amazing. I've probably replayed this game a billion times by now and love it each run I do. Each character has an in-depth background and I like that some of the character's stories don't shy away from real life issues, Shane's story in particular. The game is also very easily compatible with a wide variety of mods that can help add more to each run you do of this game. 10/10 would not be the same without this game"
