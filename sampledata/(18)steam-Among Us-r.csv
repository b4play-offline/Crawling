22,"Got it to play with friends, and it certainly is great for that purpose! I also like the freeplay option, as it allows me to get used to tasks and map layouts between games. I also appreciate the in-depth customization options, and the ability to customize game settings such as number of impostors, extra roles, and so on. Overall an enjoyable experience with endless possibilities!"

But beware! The amongus crewmate is a dangersous man with a lknife and a gun and anthrax and he will mail them, to you.!  once the anthrax squad declares that you have a week to live, you are tasked with the decisiopn of who to put down with the gun (you only have 3 bullets in the gun, due to bullet inflation,. If yo udecide correctly, you win! if you are wrong, you enter the coutroom drama phase of the game. In the coutroom phase of the game you are given the option to eat your cyanide pill or attempt to chokeslam the ballif for your freedom. once free of the courtroom, you drop dead of anthrax poisoning, and enter the judg,emt phase. here you meet God, and he sends yhou to hell the end

Lobby list shows dramatically different set of games each time I hit refresh, meaning we can't even manually join a server together. All the various types of invite fail every time. Yes, our internet is fine. Unnacceptable for a full release."

193,"Even though I just started this game, let me say this....IT IS ADDICTING!! It did give me a little bit of anxiety being the Impostor, but each time I play that role, my anxiety goes down a little bit. I am just afraid of being caught and having to convince people its not me (when it is) is hard. It is a fun game to play and I enjoy it a lot. 

The only complaint I have is that I wish there was more female outfits/hats."

The Zen garden really calms me down and I love the benefits of being able to get coins from marigolds when I take care of them. It’s nice to see the smiles on their faces. I love this game since it brought me so much nostalgia, and is just good overall.

He lived,died for our sins,rose from death,and He's returning soon to take His belivers into Heaven.
Whoever belives in Him shall not perish,but have eternal life,you also need to repent to be saved.

217,"I can't take it any more. Among Us has singlehandedly ruined my life. The other day my teacher was teaching us Greek Mythology and he mentioned a pegasus and I immediately thought 'Pegasus? more like Mega Sus!!!!' and I've never wanted to kms more. I can't look at a vent without breaking down and fucking crying. I can't eat pasta without thinking 'IMPASTA??? THATS PRETTY SUS!!!!' Skit 4 by Kanye West. The lyrics ruined me. A Mongoose, or the 25th island of greece. The scientific name for pig. I can't fucking take it anymore.

224,"TLDR: A fun social deduction game, as long as it's not taken to heart.

This game really tests friendships. It's fun with the right group of people, just keep in mind to not take things seriously. I have had fun games that lead to funny stories and I have had terrible games that have lead to people never speaking to each other ever again. But in summary, I have enjoyed playing this game, so that's why I am recommending it. 

What drew it to me was that the premise was based on the Sci-Fi film called The Thing by John Carpenter in 1982. 
Very much on that theme, the crew need to accomplish a certain number of tasks, while a number of impostors are attempting to stop the crew by killing them off. The ghosts of the crew can continue to complete the tasks, meaning the impostors still need to kill off everyone before the tasks are completed. It is the job of the living crew to deduce who the impostors are, leading to a voting system where upon completion, whomever is chosen is shoved out of an airlock. Although the impostors are also able to contribute to the deduction and can work together to shift the blame onto an innocent member of the crew."

311,"When I think of Liza as a child, I remember how much she loved exploring the ravine behind our house. Half of our summers were spent wandering through the woods, looking for crayfish under rocks along the creek, climbing trees, and generally doing things that would have given our parents gray hair much sooner if they knew what we had been up to each day.

I have to share one memory that really illustrates Liza's fearless, and sometimes impulsive, nature. Some of the neighborhood boys had built a rope swing in a tree along the ravine's edge. Liza, being fearless, decided to give it a try.

As she swung out over the edge, one of the boys jokingly called out, ""Jump!"" My heart leaped to my throat as I saw Liza let go of the rope on her next swing out. Luckily she wound up with nothing more than skinned knees and a sheepish grin that said she couldn't believe she had just done that, but it just goes to show what a risk taker she was.

More than a simple risk taker, Liza also had a generous soul, as I'm sure many of you here this morning can attest to. She never met a person in need that she didn't find some way of helping. Her work as director of our local family shelter became her greatest passion, and she put in tireless hours organizing meals and places where ""her families"" could all stay together until they could get back on their feet. I say, ""her families"" with all seriousness because she didn't just take them into shelters; she really took them into her heart and kept contact with them even after their lives were back on track."

A couple of friends and I dabble back into it every now and then since then; and it still brings such happiness amongst us (heheh).

Just a thank you for providing some happiness during a crazy time in our lives <3"

Totally trash."

But the majority of the time when you are playing a public lobby, it's just people blindly accusing others of being the impostor without having any evidence. When that doesn't happen people don't try to play the game and just talk about random things. Another issue is people leaving instantly as soon as they see they aren't impostor.

386,"I am a 86 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

The only place I had to call home was a steel trashcan hidden in the back of an alley, and I ate nothing but gravel and old newspapers for every meal. One day, I encounter a kid sitting at a bus stop playing this game while out gathering pebbles. As soon as I see the game, I feel my long-lost youth return to my body, and inhuman strength fills me as I wrestle the phone from the child's grasp and win the game with a series of ten billion IQ impostor plays just as he was about to throw the game away with a poorly timed vent. As soon as I win, I feel my drug and alcohol addictions permanently leave my body.  Everyone on the street immediately notices my god-like skill, and my fame soon spreads throughout the entire state of California until even the wildfires know my name. Ten minutes later, I am elected as governor, and work immediately begins on using every last dollar in the state to reshape it as a giant crewmate.

467,"I used to play this game, but now I hate it. Why?
Because every time I hop into a server, I always see people arguing against each other and insulting at each other.
I just want to play Among Us; NOT get into any arguments.
If only this game has the option to disable text & voice chats, I would disable them forever.
I decided to uninstall this game, remove it from my library, and never play it again.
Among Us is fun, but its community is very toxic.
Please don't buy this game, it's not worth your money and your time."

536,"Among Us is simple and fun to play with friends but there's a horrendous RP underbelly that nobody really talks about. Some lobbies don't even start the game and just send explicit messages to each other and swap snapchats and discords. Considering this game attracts children, this worries me. 

As long as they don't create an account it should be fine? But even so parents should be aware that this is a thing. And theres a LOT of it. Please be careful."
537,AMONG US
538,"Still a good game.
I wish they would add a better server browser to differentiate between normal games and the ones that players have created, such as shift and seek. It's really annoying to either join a normal game and people want to play with different rules, or to be in a game with different rules where people don't realise and start playing normally."
539,"Cool game, can never think of the words Among Us without thinking of backstabbing jellybeans.
Great game 10/10"

544,The biggest mystery this game provides is the mystery of why every time I'm the impostor the actual literal single-celled organisms I've been playing with the whole time become Sherlock Holmes's descendants infused with the wisdom of Athena. Or they randomly vote you out because funny amogus.

When I first started playing I was optimistic about the game, but the moment I entered a meeting I was berated with a bunch of stupid remarks such as ""RED SUS"" ""BLACK VENTED"" ""I SAW BLUE KILL"" most of which were completely made up and made me want to bang my head onto my keyboard. If you are older than 9, I wouldn't recommend this game."

693,"A game best played with friends. The comical animation and sounds mix well with the simplistic mechanics of the initial game. Part of me wishes there was ambient music or sounds within the maps themselves, but that is a minor gripe.

The comminity itself has recently grown to be... interesting, to say the least, which is why I recommend this for groups of friends."

I have played it on my phone cause it is free on there and other than people being retards its a fun game. The controls are annoying on Mobile though but i imagine they are much better on PC. I wouldnt say it is worth five dollars but at the time of review it is a bit cheaper so i say its worth it."

739,"Episode 101: Pilot

Walt speaking into camcorder in the desert [2:10-3:13 / Prologue]

Walt:         My name is Walter Hartwell White.  I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.  To all law enforcement entitles, this is not an admission of guilt.  I am speaking to my family now.  Skyler, you are the love of my life.  I hope you know that.  Walter Junior, you’re my big man.  There are going to be some things–things that you’ll come to learn about me in the next few days.  I just want you to know that no matter how it may look, I only had you in my heart.  Good-bye.

Walt to high school students in his classroom [7:35-7:45 /Act One]

Walt:         Well, technically, chemistry is the study of matter.  But I prefer to see it as the study of change.

Hank during Walt’s birthday party at Walt’s house [11:52-12:15 / Act One]

Hank:        Everybody listen up, listen up, listen up!  I’m going to give a toast, a little toast to my brother-in-law.  Come here.  Walt, you got a brain the size of Wisconsin, but we’re not going to hold that against you.  Because your heart’s in the right place, man.  Your heart’s in the right place.  We love you, man.  We love you.

Walt and Jesse outside Jesse’s house [28:00-30:04 / Act Two]

Jesse:         Why are you here?

Walt:         I was curious.  Honestly, I never expected you to amount to much, but methamphetamine?  I didn’t picture that.  There’s a lot of money in it, huh?

Jesse:         I don’t know what you’re talking about.

Walt:         No?

Jesse:         Not a clue.

Walt:         Cap’n Cook?  That’s not you?  Like I said, no one is looking for you.

Jesse:         Look, I don’t know what you think you’re doing here, Mr. White.  I mean, if you’re planning on giving me some bowl-winder about getting right with Jesus by turning myself in–

Walt:         Not really.

Jesse:         High school was a long time ago.

Jesse:         You ain’t “Welcome Back Kotter,” so step off.  No speeches.

Walt:         Short speech.  You lost your partner today.  What’s his name?  Emilio?  Emilio is going to prison.  The DEA took all your money, your lab.  You got nothing.  Square one.  But you know the business.  And I know the chemistry.  I’m thinking maybe you and I could partner up.

Jesse:         You want to cook crystal meth?  You?  You and, uh and me?

Walt:         That’s right.  Either that or I turn you in.

Walt to Jesse outside Jesse’s house [33:40-33:50 / Act Three]

Walt:         You and I will not make garbage.  We will produce a chemically pure and stable product that performs as advertised.  No adulterants.  No baby formula.  No chili powder.

Walt and Jesse outside the credit union [36:04-37:10 / Act Three]

Jesse:         Wait, wait, hold on.  Tell me why you’re doing this.  Seriously.

Walt:         Why do you do it?

Jesse:         Money–mainly.

Walt:         There you go.

Jesse:         Nah, come on!  Man, some straight like you, giant stick up his ass, all of a sudden at age, what, 60, he’s just going to break bad?

Walt:         I’m 50.

Jesse:         It’s weird is all, okay?  It doesn’t compute.  Listen.  If you’ve gone crazy or something I mean, if you’ve if you’ve gone crazy or depressed, I’m just saying that’s something I need to know about.  Okay?  I mean, that affects me.

Walt:         I am awake.

Jesse:         What?

Walt:         Buy the RV.  We start tomorrow.

 

Episode 102: Cat’s in the Bag…

Walt teaching his students about chirals [9:31-11:05 / Act One]

Walt:         So the term “chiral” derives from the Greek word hand.  The concept here being that just as your left hand and your right hand are mirror images of one another, right? Identical and yet opposite.  Well, so too organic compounds can exist as mirror image forms of one another all the way down at the molecular level.  But although they may look the same, they don’t always behave the same.  For instance … Thalidomide.  The right-handed isomer of the drug Thalidomide is a perfectly fine good medicine to give to a pregnant woman to prevent morning sickness.  But make the mistake of giving that same pregnant woman the left-handed isomer of the drug Thalidomide and her child will be born with horrible birth defects.  Which is precisely what happened in the 1950s.  So, chiral, chirality, mirrored images, right? Active, inactive.  Good, bad….

 

Episode 105: Gray Matter

Hank during the family intervention at the Whites’ house [29:57-31:37 / Act Three]

Hank:        All right, look, buddy.  I know I don’t get to tell you this enough, but I care about you a hell of a lot.  And this cancer thing?  Let’s face it.  You know, you were dealt a s___ hand.  But sometimes your luck can change.  I mean, I can’t tell you how many times I was, you know, I started with a s___ hand and I ended up with a full house.  Okay?  I mean, the key is, you gotta hang in there.  Man, you gotta keep placing your bets.  Keep placing your bets.… Look at it this way, okay?  It’s the bottom of the ninth.  Bases are loaded.  You’re up.  But you got a bum arm.  Right?  There’s no frickin’ way you’re gonna hit a homer.  So you can either let the pinch hitter take the bat, or you can hold on to your pride and lose the game.  Get what I’m saying? … You got your pride, man.  I get it.  If this Daddy Warbucks wants to chip in, man, I’m with your old lady on this one.  I say take the money and run.

Walt during the family intervention at the Whites’ house [34:53-39:00 / Act Three]

Walt:         All right, I’ve got the talking pillow now.  Okay?  We all, in this room, we love each other.  We want what’s best for each other, and I know that.  I am very thankful for that.  But what I want, what I need, is a choice….  Sometimes, I feel like I never actually make any of my own–choices, I mean.  My entire life, it just seems I never, you know, had a real say about any of it.  Now this last one–cancer–all I have left is how I choose to approach this…. Skyler, you’ve read the statistics.  These doctors talking about surviving.  One year, two years, like it’s the only thing that matters.  But what good is it to just survive if I am too sick to work, to enjoy a meal, to make love?  For what time I have left, I want to live in my own house.  I want to sleep in my own bed.  I don’t want to choke down thirty or forty pills every single day and lose my hair and lie around too tired to get up and so nauseated that I can’t even move my head.  You cleaning up after me?  Me–some dead man, some artificially alive, just marking time?  No.  No.  And that’s how you would remember me.  That’s the worst part.  So that is my thought process, Skyler.  I’m sorry.  I just–I choose not to do it.

Among Us is a fun multiplayer game. While it may have been popular only in 2020, it still holds up. With the addition of new Cosmicubes, new roles (hopefully!), and new QoL updates coming out now and then, it's pretty fun. Not even to mention the actual game! I won't go to long as you can read other reviews, but all in all...

Always be aware of your posture, remember to stand up straight. Your customers and your back will thank you for it. Put effort into your appearance, all employees are required to dress appropriately. Keep your uniform clean, and pressed. If you want respect, you must look respectable. Speak in complete sentences, we never use one word greetings like ""Hey"" or ""Yeah?"" Always make eye contact, and finally, whenever you're with a customer or not, remain composed. Inside, you can be thinking about your homework, or friends, or your side business, but no one should ever know it. Because at Los Pollos Hermanos, someone... Is always watching. So dont forget to smile! Thats all for today, see you next time when we'll be discussing cleanliness."

if youve got a reasonably large friend group (6+) to play with it can be fun but now, its really fucking annoying and almost impossible to play with the current mindset of most of the playerbase, that is constantly saying sus over and over again and other insanely unfunny ironic ""humor"""

Playing with randoms though is really annoying and you can have your time wasted when people troll or vote you out for no reason. Anyways, among us is a great game to play with friends."

868,"My mom said that my aunt died and that we are going to her funeral the next morning. As soon as she left the room crying I busted out laughing because it reminded me of among us a popular video game. So as we were riding in the car I was thinking about saying ""dead body reported"" at the funeral. When we finally arrived I screamed ""dead body reported"" everyone was looking at me like i'm some sort of a weirdo. Then I remembered that my grandfather's sister fell in the vents and died when she was 2 years old. So I said grandpa's sister sus she vented. My grandfather started crying and everyone was screaming at me instead of laughing. My mom took my x box and said that I am going to therapist tomorrow. Idk man my mom is acting kinda sussy

869,"I LOVE THIS GAME. Is it two years out of the spotlight? Yes, maybe. But do I have more fun in this game than I do with any other? Also yes.

904,"I got banned for a week by bypassing the Censorships. Still surprises me I could do that, hopefully this gets patched so all slurs/highly offensive words are censored no matter which language you speak (or in this case, type). Examples being the Southern Pronunciation of the Spanish word for Black in Spanish and the Star Wars Storm Troopers Inspiration in Japanese, I could get away with using those words no problem though funnily enough the old Germanic word for Soldier during 1939-1945 isn't allowed in Spanish (and German to nobody's surprise). The reason why I ""tampered"" (if you can call it that) with Innersloth's Censorships was because of how some words aren't allowed despite not really being associated with hateful thinking. The last four letters of Raccoon aren't allowed by themselves, but Raccoon? Can't see how you can offend someone with America's Panda. The ""not-so-bad-sounding"" slur for Caucasians isn't allowed, but that's because the first five letters aren't allowed by themselves because it is related to a recreational drug that does worse than bad. The one name that isn't allowed for some weird reason other than ""Just Cuz"" is the name Star Dream; Dream is allowed, Star is allowed, hell, even Dream Star is allowed as well. But not Star Dream. I can still somehow get away with a certain acronym who spells Clan with a ""K"", so hopefully that gets patched asap. That's the reason why I played around with the Censorships and rightfully got banned for a week, hopefully Innersloth reads this so we can enjoy AMONGUS with edgeless humour. Worth it"

Among us in real life (sus, sus)
Among us in real life (sus, sus)

Playing among us in real life
Spaceship with my crew
Gonna split up spread out
'Cause we all got tasks to do
Gotta find the imposter
As they try to sabotage
Who can we trust in this among us entourage?
Heard a sound, turned around
Looking up, looking down
Then I find a dead body
Gotta blow the horn emergency
Discussion who should we believe
Can't decide so now we leave
Not sure what I'm about to see
Will it be a dead body
Still have a task I must complete

Who's the impostеr?
Looking sus, who can we trust?

I'm a ghost, I'm my biggest fear
Got killed by the imposter
I was playing in the game
But now I'm just a watcher
I'm paying attention using my 360 vision
If it gets quiet I listen
Make sure there's nothing I'm missing

[Rebecca]
Everyone is sus so let this last round begin
[Zoey]
There's an imposter among us
Trying to take something from us
We're still over here working
While she's just ghosting above us
Someone's under suspicion
Sabotaging our mission
Doing my task in the kitchen
Until I stop look and listen

[All]
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?

That's me
While everyone's doing tasks
I'm going through vents on a killing spree
Yea, I'm sus in among us
We can discuss whoever took your life
But if you think you're running this game, oh yeah
That's me holding this knife

1008,"Its pretty fun to play but be warned of the toxic players (you can block them but I have noticed that sometimes I'm unable to) and the players who just want to spam inappropriate words if they have censorship turned off. I don't mind the inappropriate words but it does bug me when you are playing a match and instead of playing the game and chatting with crew mates they are just spamming these words.
There are players who will play together and chat through voice chat that may help each other out but  honestly its fine to be in a vc with a friend but keep what role you have hidden from each other as it makes the game for fun for you and the other players (also if players find out that are are in a vc and teaming then theres a high chance that you will be kicked from the match party)

1056,"I'm not going to lie. The memes ruined this game for me, but I have seen the latest updates. The devs really changed a good amount of stuff, and I think this game is once again golden like it was when I first played. I would recommend Among Us. You need to use teamwork and, more importantly, your brain. The only problem I have is the younger players and the trolls. It is a little annoying when you are trying to win a game, and a child is just saying the most random things and accusing random people of being the imposter when they're actually innocent. Children aside, the idea of this game is unique, although not completely original. It is like the game called murder on Garry's mod but with more steps and... 3-foot tall bean people. If you are looking to have a laugh and possibly meet the next Sherlock Holmes, you should definitely get this game."
1057,OOOO
1058,to sussy VERY SCARY (pants peed)

1060,YOU CAN DO THE GRIDDY !!!!
1061,"I'm sure that everyone now knows what Among Us is because of the massive popularity on the internet but you don't, this is what I think about the game. 

The game itself takes a while to get a hold of. There are crewmates and one to three imposters. The crewmates' jobs are to fix the ship in the form of a task and to vote the imposter out if they can, while the imposter's job is to kill all the crewmates. Each task is different a is fun and sometimes frustrating to do. While the vents system that the imposter can access, which you move to different rooms. While in a meeting the crewmates and the imposter can vote someone of the ship.  

This game is fun and a good way to pass the time if your playing with strangers, but it is so much fun when playing with friends and family. 

Overall this game is very fun and entertaining to play and I would highly recommend it to almost everyone. 

I hope you found this review helpful.

You need a lot of patience to work with others in this game since:
1) Your message might go in one ear and go out the other, no matter how credible it is
2) People tend to cheat. For example, a brother telling his sister who the impostor is."

Game is easy to understand and fun with friends. The point is that you are in a place and you need to find who is 'Among Us'. You do this by watching out for everyone. When you find out (sus out) who it is you report them and they get thrown out. If you are the 'red crewmate' you try to assassinate your friends without being sus. I once had a dream where I was playing a sequel to this game called 'Between Us'. The new updates are solid and the community is really."

1287,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is"

At least I wouldn't be conditioned to say ""red sus"" every time someone I know passes away. This game has made me a much worse person. Even playing with friends is mediocre, and don't even get me started on public lobbies.

1308,"[h1]We're all sus![/h1]

[b][u]PROS[/u]:[/b] Among Us is a social deduction game that became a sleeper hit for a bit.  The game involves a team of crewmates attempting to complete micro games for tasks, & find out which of them is a murderous imposter.  The imposter must simply kill everyone & trick their teammates into believing them.  There are a few unique roles for each side, providing minor tweaks to gameplay, & a handful of maps with different tasks that can be exclusive to each.  The visuals are cute & simplistically memorable, & the soundtrack is more atmospheric, enhancing the little sounds heard from tasks more.

[b][u]CONS[/u]:[/b] The lobbies for discussing each time a meeting is called don't have any sort of mic support, making things a little more difficult & cumbersome when it comes to finding the imposter.  Besides that, the only other hiccup is a general lack of content providing only 4 maps, with 3 having a noticeably smaller player count compared to the most popular.

[b][u]ACHIEVEMENTS[/u]:[/b] This list actually has some challenge despite being a mafia style game.  Some do require a bit of luck, but the fun ones require a specific playstyle while mostly playing as the imposter.  There are a select few for crewmates, & the obvious grind ones, but overall is a rather straightforward list.

[b][u]FINAL[/u]:[/b] Among Us really can be a blast, even more so with a group of friends in a separate chat.  It's simple design & gameplay make it an easy pick up & play title, & has plenty to have the player coming back, if they enjoyed the bits of potential fun they had.  It's easily worth a look, especially if one loves mafia style games."

1342,"A fun twist on the concept of the age old game of Werewolf, that has sadly just doesn't have the same level of enjoyment anymore.

Some of the new additions and changes feel more like they are a detriment to the game, rather than a contribution, although my biggest gripe is with the players themselves, and this has been an ongoing issue for me.

Essentially, just about every lobby I encounter, typically choose to min/max literally everything on the game settings for stupidly fast paced games, and expect you to like it, or leave. Most games also typically seem to inspire no actual thought process, outside of ""trust me bro"" or just calling out people in hopes you just happen to get lucky.
And good luck getting your own lobby going. If you happen to have preferences for a different kind of game, you'll probably struggle to get a lobby going. I've waited up to an hour in some cases, before giving up entirely. And this is assuming I don't disconnect randomly and have to make a new lobby, and hope for the best.

That said, when you do hit gold, it's a blast to play, genuine fun to stalk people as the Imposter, or even be stalked by one, if they're skilled at deception, and know when to make a move. We all know what to expect, but it's how the Imposter chooses to engage with the crew that makes these matches so damn interesting and memorable.
And sometimes you just want to roleplay as Dr. Kleiner from Half Life, and can only react through dialogue lines from the game itself. Including the HUEAGHs.

Sadly, those moments are too far and few in between, and I've practically concluded that I either have to hop into another lobby and hope for the best someone wants to actually properly play, or wait half an hour to make my own. Whilst I respect everyone's preferences might be different, for this kind of game, there's only so many ways you can play it and still maintain some element of fun. Me? I prefer it more 'classic,' and actually playable, rather than going at Mach 8 through literally everything.

Oh, and then there's t h o s e kinds of people that show up in this game. The ones that feel the need to cheat, at a bloody £4 flash game of Werewolf in space. And then you have the ones that decide they feel the best medium for Erotic Roleplay is through.. Among Us. For some god forsaken reason, they choose to do cybersex, in Among Us.

...You know who you are, and you should be ashamed of yourselves for doing it. 


Anyways, don't play this game, unless you have like.. 8-12 friends. If you have to play it solo, you're going to have a miserable time, just like me."

1436,"I am a 44 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded Among Us and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, since he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, joined a lobby but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it and it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

1438,i love being imposter.
1439,No.
1440,This game is amazing'
1441,I love this game as it provides an opportunity to troll other people by pressing the Emergency Button right at the start and making them wait the entire time.
1442,"Long ago god created adam and eve, these 2 lived in the garden of eden. This was until one day a snake (the devil) convinced eve to eat from the tree of knowledge, after this eve convinced adam to too. When god found out about this he was furious and kicked them out of the garden of eden.

So why am I recounting the event of genesis you may ask, well I believe that that story was inspired by a among us. Now hear me out. What the snake? An Impostor. And what did the snake turn eve into? A second Impostor. An what did their actions end up doing? Convincing god to kick adam out.

So this is how the original story goes: When the game started red (the snake/devil) was apointed as impostor, they then convinced green (eve) to second impostor with them by DMing her over discord. Red called an emergency meeting and both red and green convinced yellow (god) that they had both seen blue (adam) vent, resulting in blue being voted out. As confirm ejects was on yellow saw that blue wasn't impostor and in turn was sus of both red and green. At the next emergency meeting red managed to convince yellow that green was impostor and they voted her out. This resulted in blue and green being ejected from the skeld (the garden of eden) and red. At the end bluw and green could never make it back to the skeld and red won.

TLDR: Among us is so good it inspired the Bible and the creation of mankind"

1477,Playing with friends is 100 percent worth it but playing with randos is the worst.
1478,"if you are a bit quiet, shy person, and have free time this games would be excellent for people who want something for friends or if you don't have friends I would Probably not get this unless you like typing to random people in lobby's. its a bit over-hyped as well but if you like text chat murder mystery this would be the best game for you as they still have a active fan-base even if its fallen a bit. So check this out if it sounds like you."
1479,"Among Us lives up to the hype created by its delayed explosion in popularity, for the most part. It's a style of intense, refreshing multiplayer experience that simply didn't catch on digitally before recently. Its well-earned following speaks to just how enticing murdering and deceiving your friends can be, as well as Innersloth's endearing art, approachability, and clever minigame design. I don't have any sus that this will be the last game of its breed to make a splash, since we’re already seeing its influence on even mega-games like Fortnite. But it’s the breakout hit for the genre, and it's a great first impression.

1505,This game is very sus
1506,When the suspicious is imposter!!! hahahahA!!!! yes!
1507,"generally fun game. despite the memes it is better to play with friends. my only complaint is we need to get rid of the hackers, but we're all trying our best. :)"
1508,this is a great game and it has very good mods that i have to download but its still fun id love for you to pay instead of going on mobile and doing it
1509,"I've been playing this game like a crack fiend from Bristol during the O.G Lockdown days and its squeals. Every day I get flashbacks like the war vets in Vietnam and I can't take it anymore. Every day I see among us characters in the outside world with its high-bassed theme tune and I just want to end it all. The way how the white characters look at me, seems sus and this is a cry for help please somebody!!!! do not trust the whites as they are not human and want to take over this planet. 

*knocking sounds*

OH NO, I hear them, they're breaking through and now they've cut out the electricty, I can't hear anything because its too dark and I see 2 of them, I know 1 is already white but I can't figure out the other 1 due to lights being cut. 1 grabs my buttocks whilst I can feel the other licking my neck. I think they're marinating me as I'm their main course *tehe* but NO!!! they're lubing me up and fucking me from behind please help me and my gapping Ballon knot, I now know the other character with white is a Ni.........


WOULD not recommend this game to anyone who was born on days that end with a 'Y'
Great to play with friends tho"

I can't load or play the game, always stuck on a black screen. August update and I still can't play the game because I'm stuck on a black screen. This game was completely fine for me in May 2022 until the June update came. Time to get rid of this game"

1660,"Sadly I never got to play Among Us when it was at its most popular, however my nephews convinced me to buy it and play it with them a few days ago and honestly, I am glad they did. I had this negative perception about the game and how I thought it would not be a game for me - but the game is fun, a lot of fun, if you play with friends and family. 

Among Us costs less than most beverages in my country so as far as criticism goes, I have none. In terms of value for your money, this game is up there with the best, so if you have friends and or family that plays/wants to play, buy it and I guarantee you will have fun (maybe start a few family feuds, too)."

1713,"I can not believe the time has come. It is an absolutely fantastic time to be alive. Nothing has ever made me feel as grateful as this great event. This is indeed a marvelous point in time. Finally, the people may unleash themselves from the prison they were captivated in. I do not have the words to describe my emotions' inner struggle. I have waited for this time for my whole life. To see the title ""Among Us"" appear on the screen, gazing upon my soul. I am absolutely speechless. It is as if every fibre of my very being had shattered and all of a sudden refreshed ... Nay, reincarnated my very existence. I have now become UBER human of grand stature - and I am unstoppable. My power levels have reached all time high to the point where celestial intervention was required in order to prevent our fabric of reality as we know it from being zero-summed, all thanks to my presence here on Earth. My meta power needed to be reduced so that I may peacefully co-exist in society. No longer will the common proletariat faint on the spot when gazing upon my grand aura after I was bestowed the opportunity to play and master the arts of AMOGSUS.

I want to thank you all, users of the internet, for haggling Innersloth to introduce us to amogbussy that makes this magnum opus. We are all victorious, and this amazing amalgamation of the game's high quality features will forever be commemorated in our collective memory, as a source of joy, a source of hope for the future. This calls for a celebration, of being truly happy and lucky that we exist in this reality. Let us go forward and stutter in peace."

Because have some cheater in game and some people when See aren't

"
1764,"No, this game is a parasite leeched into my brain, i encounter at least one among us character every day and it sends me spiraling into a mental breakdown harder than any i've experienced before, this game is vile, this game is corrupt, this game has caused a plague of sussies to fall upon the earth, this game is a disgrace, and this game has no place in my library"

1768,I recommend this game because it is very positive and helps you think.
1769,"[h1]Among Us[/h1]
[u][i]I wish mixed reviews were an option.[/i][/u]

[h1]Good part[/h1]
This game overall is very good and you can have some amazing fun when proper communication and trickery is implemented. I would recommend finding a good bunch of people to play with or a bunch of friends over discord. You can have so much fun.

[h1]Bad part[/h1]
General online community is terrible.
[list]
    [*]No real communication just shout a colour and people vote which basically gives the game to the impostors.
    [*]30% of the game leaves at the start because they didn't get impostor.
    [*]The community devolves into a racist and generally offensive place to be.
    [*]Most people don't do their tasks.
    [*]Even when using Innersloths discord servers to find players it's usually full of kids shouting racist abuse and generally obscenities. 
    [*]People use discord to cheese and tell their friends who the impostor is etc.
[/list]

[h1]Overall[/h1]
The game has endless potential when played with good people or friends. Playing with randoms is frustrating and very unfulfilling most of the time. At the time of writing this review I can wait to finish my final achievements, uninstall and never look back.

Yet another good game ruined by a wholly carcinogenic community.

Oh online gaming, what happened to you?

2042,"Yo honestly this is a really good game, ong get it if you don't mind chatting with people. Some people may be trolls n stuff sometimes, but when you get into an actual good game, which ain't even hard in the first place mind you, it's a really fun detective type game. I haven't played in a year and the amount of stuff they added completely blows my mind. Honestly, please try this out, and HMU if you play this game on any platform since it's cross-play. Love this game with a passion and I hope anyone reading this gives it a try. You do kinda need to socialize tho tbh, so keep that in mind as teamwork makes the dreamwork."

2055,this game is really cool and there are so much stuff u can do with the game. the game is based off a murder mystery where the game choose 1 person out of the group to be the Imposter/killer. The Imposter has to kill everyone and not get caught. you can add mods like procsemity chat or mods that give the Imposter no kill timer. i said it before ill say it again this game is awsome.

It doesn't work well, it's absolutely useless because your ''account'' is strictly limited to the platform you're playing on and adds like 40 more stupid steps to be able to play...

Innersloth if you are reading this please may you add this color called fortegreen. if you dont know what that color is then you can go check on the internet or on among us wiki fandom.
it also appears at the bottom of the dropship when somone joins the lobby. if you do add fortegreen to among us then i will give you a good review also you can make it so you have to buy the fortegreen color or you could make it for free. anyway hopefully you add fortegreen to among us and hopefully you have a nice day.

from DianaPavic.


please please please add fortegreen color to among us and also answer me innersloth in the comments.

look all what i am trying to say is that this game is really good but it is missing one thing it is the fortegreen color. just add it so i can be happy and everyone else that is a fan of that color can be happy too."

2155,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer"

2160,"Simply put, this game sucks cheeks. Player base is made up of infantile children. Starting a game in a public lobby is nearly impossible due to the small brained nature of the kids who run the lobbies. The only way to have fun in this game is to know over 8 individual people and play the game with all of them at once and follow the silent rules. Not worth 5 dollars. Maybe worth 1."

2179,This game sucks
2180,"of course i recommend it,best with friends"
2181,"""An amazing indie game.""
You could use these words to describe Minecraft.
You could use these words to describe Stardew Valley.
... or you could use them to describe Among Us.

Innersloth's Latest Production is Among Us, an interactive game about trust... and betrayal.

About high-tech space ships... and making burgers.

This game is amazing. More words could be said, but don't need to.


One problem I had with this game was connecting to games.

If you play Pokemon GO, you've probably heard something like:
""Did you know they run this game on a printer?""

That's referring to how bad Pokemon GO's service is.

... Among Us makes Pokemon GO look like optic fibre cables.

Failed to connect to server.

2182,chill and takes logic
2183,"its very nice
"
2184,"I do recommend this game when it was fun but now it’s gets boring, people kicks you and ban you and it gets annoying cause you just want to play, just make private servers so then you don’t have to put it on the servers screen"
2185,yea
2186,Learn how good my friends are at lying. Most fun with friends.

2192,"best game ever im gonna cry its so good
"
2193,"When you're not sure which game to play with friends on a late night. Among Us is a strong choice. Without friends it can feel repetitive, so i suggest taking a break every so often to keep things fresh. I defiantly will continue to play. <3"
2194,Still a good fun game to play with in 2022.
2195,not hello neighbor :\

2200,"Vintage chocolate chip cookies best enjoyed while playing this game

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking"

2218,"Forward: I recommend this if you have a large group of friends or part of a gaming group. I do not recommend playing in the public servers, flat fact, people tend to ruin the game for the more serious players of the game.

Now with that out of the way, the company has taken strides to updating and continuously adding to this game (for better or for worse, but at least it is optional) and it doesn't seem like they are going to stop anytime soon.

I went back to play after not playing for almost a year and the game is not to my liking anymore, but I still recommend it if you have a large group of friends to play with, up to 14 other people max."

2237,"The base idea for the game is excellent, and playing as an impostor is a challenging and anxiety including affair. The game itself is executed well for the idea, but the game falls short for the following reasons:

• The community is both annoying and cringe - the most cringeworthy community there is. Old and ""funny"" memes, stupid names and all these things.
• No one uses their brain. A random player can out of nowhere suspect someone who has done nothing, and only because this one person said ""x sus"" that player gets voted immediately. You can literally scan in front of everyone and get voted off the next round.
• Devs give jackshit about their game. People *still* leave constantly after finding out they're not the impostor. It is insane how there is no cooldowns or similar penalties about this.

The game itself is fine, but the players make it nearly unplayable to the point where the only way to enjoy this game is by playing with a large group of friends. And I don't have friends.

Still this game is pretty fun and u can enjoy this game with your friends (If you don't have friends like me then u can enjoy with randoms ;-;) overall i don't recommend this game to buy on 2022.

2283,"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.

I am never gonna play this crappy game and watch among us vids ever again! This has to be one the worst games ever made and one the worst games of 2022.

Guys, Here are some reasons why I hate this game:
1. The game animation is plain garbage
2. The game is kinda laggy when you're playing in some servers
3. The game has technical problems
4. It's hard to find some servers to play sometimes
5. I hate the fricking word ""sus""

2417,"I can't fucking take it. I see an image of a random object posted and then I see it, I fucking see it. ""Oh that looks kinda like the among us guy"" it started as. That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a fridge that looked like among us, I'd see an animated bag of chips that looked like among us, I'd see a hat that looked like among us. And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than ""sus."" I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is ""red sus"" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word ""among"" is ruined. The phrase ""among us"" is ruined. I can't live anymore. Among us has destroyed my fucking life. I want to eject myself from this plane of existence. MAKE IT STOP!"

2428,"I Like how Innersloth is always Trying his best to Add Updates into the game and i think the Updates are the only reason people still play Among Us because The Updates just add in extra ways of having fun in the game there are multiple bugs that end up in this game that really make People mad and The creator just always tries his best to fix the bugs and make it a Normal Experience and One thing i think he needs to do is to actually give Crewmates a reason for doing tasks because Some people just hate doing tasks because they don't even Unlock Anything that Special for Completing their tasks and task wins are such a rare way of Winning the game and that,s why people get kind of board when they have already Completed their Tasks I am really Excited for the Future of this Game and Ready to see how much better Innersloth can Change the game with these Monthly Updates (Thanks for Reading this Love Your Game Innersloth)."

So as we were riding in the car I was thinking about saying ""dead body reported"" at the funeral. When we finnaly arived I screamed ""dead body reported"" everyone was looking me like if some sort of a weirdo. Then I remembered that my grandfather's sister fell in the vents and died when she was 2 years old. So I said grandpa's sister sus she vented.

2554,"I absolutely recommend Among Us to anyone that likes hiding or something similar. With the new additions, the game is way more fun than when it got popular. The only thing bad about the game is the constant bugs and errors while playing. It also needs some more work, for ex: the matchmaking is not very good as it is right now, people should have a more severe punish for leaving the match 10 secs after the game starts, making more modes to play and keep the game fresh, but most importantly they need to fix the bugs because it makes the game unplayable sometimes."

My only hope is at some point the devs do a complete overhaul of this game starting from nothing but textures which I know could be daunting but I think this would be the best way to eliminate all current bugs plaguing the game"

2575,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

""They were a phase. We did one, it was the big event of that summer, let it die.""

I liked it for a while, but then it went the way of Fall Guys and COMPLETELY lost people just as quickly as it grabbed them. Leaving me without a buncha lads to play it with, and unwilling to play with randoms because that can F to the U to the C to the fuck off."

2658,"Thomas Sowell once stated that “Racism is not dead, but on life support- kept alive by politicians, race hustlers, and people who get a sense of superiority by denouncing others as racists”. Racism has been one of the most controversial and highly fought over issues in the United State for many, many years. Throughout the course of history minorities such as African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, and Japanese have all been treated with a sense of inferiority solely due to their race. There have been several movements that made efforts to a post- racial society including those of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and Cesar Chavez. Thanks to these great leaders America soon began to morph into a much more culturally diverse and accepting society. However, despite those great leaders efforts and the strides America took into becoming a less racially segregated civilization, the society in a in which we live in today is still haunted by racism. Even though a post-racial society, a society that is free from institutional, political, and social discrimination based primarily on race, is a great idea it is still not attainable. The prevalence of racism in society is highly talked about and debated in the film Crash, the short story “Desiree’s Baby” and the articles “In Living Color: Race and American Culture”, “Millennials & the Myth of the Post Racial Society: Black Youth, Intra-generational Division & the Continuing Racial Divide in American Politics”, and “Debunking the Myth of a Post-Racial Society”. The impossibility of a post-racial society today is exemplified in these various sources by showing that our behaviors both limit and extend our awareness of otherness which is evident in our in the areas societal standards and politics.

One major reason why a post-racial society is not currently possible today is due to how our behaviors limit and extend our awareness of otherness in societal standards. The film Crash is a perfect representation of societal standards impact on racism and its prevalence in society. The film Crash accurately depicts not only continuous racial issues, but also illustrates the subconscious racial thoughts and assumptions from all characters point of view. who are all from different racial backgrounds. One of the characters in the film Crash who particularly exudes the behaviors that limit her awareness of otherness due to societal standards is Jean. For instance, near the beginning of the movie whilst walking with her husband she spots two young black men, whose names are Anthony and Peter, and her initial reaction is to hold on tighter to her husband as if she is afraid. The young black man Anthony then tells his friend Peter “You couldn’t find a whiter, safer, or better lit part of the city. But this white woman sees two black guys who look like UCLA students strolling down the sidewalk and her reaction is blind fear” (Haggis). Then Anthony and Peter proceed to steal her and her husband’s car. The irony of this situation shows how society has taught people to be afraid of others who are of different races and it shows how not only do people judge others based on societal standards, they also conform to those societal standards like Anthony and Peter did. To go along with that, in the article “ In Living Color: Race and American Culture” the author Michael Omi divulges into the fact that pop culture in our society has an immense role in shaping a person’s attitude towards people of a certain race. This is clear when Omi inscribed that, “popular culture deals with the symbolic realm of social life, the images which it creates, represents, and disseminates contribute to the overall racial climate” (Omi 626). Not to mention, pop culture also controls what groups of races are being portrayed and how they are portrayed, thus shaping our societal standards of particular races. In addition to that, the short story “Desiree’s Baby” touches on the issues of our racial backgrounds defining us. Even though our racial backgrounds are not the sole quality in which human beings should be judged upon societal standards try to keep us in that mindset of judging one another based on our races in several ways. One major way in which societal standards try to keep us in that mindset is by using stereotypes as a basis to judge certain people of a particular race. In the story Desiree is judged because of her race when Armand proclaimed “that the child is not white; it means that you are not white” (Chopin 3). Immediately Armand views her negatively and sees her as inferior to him due to the stereotypes and standards in which society had taught him over time that whites are superior to blacks. However, we eventually find out that Desiree actually is white while Armand is actually not, when the letter is found that stated “night and day, I thank the good God for having so arranged our lives that our dear Armand will never know that his mother, who adores him, belongs to the race that is cursed with the brand of slavery” (Chopin 4). The aforementioned quotation highlights how quick we are to judge people because of the way we have been conditioned through societal standards to view them. Similarly, in the film Crash the character Daniel Ruiz, a locksmith, is judge by his race by the character Jean when she exclaimed to her husband “I would like the locks changed again in the morning. And you might mention that we’d appreciate it if next time they didn’t send a gang member…Yes, the guy with the shaved head, the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.” (Haggis) Due to his hispanic racial background Jean automatically assumes that Daniel Ruiz is a gang member because of the societal stereotypes and standards that are withheld of what a gang member should look like. Just because Daniel Ruiz is a Mexican man who wears baggy pants, a shaved head, and a tattoo it does not automatically make him a gang member. The examples from the film Crash and “Desiree’s Baby” both tie back into Omis article, “In Living Color: Race and American Culture”, because pop culture is used as a medium to present stereotypes that eventually become societal standards. These attitudes and behaviors of racism are not only evident in societal standards, but are also evident in politics.

Furthermore, another reason why a post-racial society is not realistic today can be attributed to how our behaviors limit and extend our awareness of otherness in the area of politics. The articles “Debunking the Myth of a Post-Racial Society” and “Millennials & the Myth of the Post-Racial Society: Black Youth, Intra-generational Divisions, & the Continuing Racial Divide in American Politics” distinctly outline the issues of race in politics. Especially in recent years race and racial discrimination have been a highly discussed topic in politics. One major instigator of this debate was if the “election of President Barack Obama was evidence of a post-racial society” (Thomas 1). Nevertheless, when juxtaposed against statistical data the election of “Obama has unleashed an unbridled racism that has not been witnessed in such regularity for some time” (Cohen 204). A case of statistical evidence that subsidizes these claims are that there is still a “22-percentage point gap between those black and white youth who feel like full and equal citizens” (Cohen 199). The election of Obama has shown how much racism still exists in our country and how the extremely racist behaviors of the past are still persisting in some members of our country and illustrates the role racism still holds in politics. Often times political leaders are automatically rejected due to their race, such as in the case of Barack Obama additionally politically leaders are immediately rejected or looked down upon due to other factors such as their religion or sexual orientations. An example of how our behaviors limit and extend our awareness of otherness in the area of politics is shown briefly in the film Crash in which the"

I'm sus"
2684,"After playing Among Us for many hours, I have some things to say. It's like the Monster Hunter games (Miiverse is essentially a made-up monster called the SPPU) but different enough to be pretty neat, and quite a bit prettier.

Advertisement

Of course there are some important differences, too. There are some people who might find the screenshots and videos on Miiverse to be distressing, to say the least. But in the game itself, it's pretty tame. The original rumor that it's a high school set in Japan, and the fact that the name of the school is Koshou Academy means that it's either a Catholic school or the local high school.

The place doesn't appear to have any offensive content. There's nothing about it that suggests it's a place you don't want your children to go.

Advertisement

However, when you start playing it, a sequence immediately reminds you this is not a game for kids. There are scenes that look like they could be ripped straight from a slasher film, complete with scary music and wildly-out-of-place gothic style outfits. It's weird, and scary, but not in a horror movie kind of way. I saw a few kids hide under their desks or try to crawl out of the classroom in terror, but after that there's really nothing. I found myself wondering how a mother would ever let her kid play such a game.

As far as I'm aware, there are no inappropriate content (unless you count some fairly disgusting language) that is inappropriate for younger players, but if that is the case, there are clear parental controls. Parents can make their own wallpapers that will change the audio and theme depending on what games are installed on the PC. They can also ban kids from playing certain games on the computer.

There are some bits that are only accessible to adults, which includes ballroom dancing and small-scale hunting (from snakes and balls). The number of balls you can carry seems limitless (I don't know if that's supposed to be an accurate comparison, though), and you can even spend some time beating the crap out of the enemies.

Sometimes, though, it's difficult to know what sort of game you're supposed to play. There's a bunch of random quests that include the occasional volleyball match or racquetball match. It's impossible to tell how to earn them, though, so you'll have to spend a lot of time wandering around the town, which is filled with gothic looking guys (the few in the video are not the focus of this game).

Some of the guys in the town look like extras from a TV show. One of them is definitely an imposter (his balls seem like a bit of an exaggeration, though). Another guy looks like a fallen character from a made-up show (albeit one with a famous fanbase) called King & Queen, which is about imposter kidnappers. It's mentioned in the game, and other pieces of media in the game, so it does exist.

Advertisement

It's a weird show, but nothing else of note in the game, and he's kind of... normal. It's like a sleazy high school soap opera on TV, and there's no mention of being anything other than imposter kidnappers. I can only assume that if that's part of the storyline that is being portrayed, then the other guys with balls, the one with a pendant, and the professor all have ulterior motives.

But there are things that aren't normal. When you first arrive in the town of Sus, there's a statue (titled ""Indescribable Indifference"") that looks very much like a high school portrait of an imposter. The statue is in front of a bulletin board that has a picture of someone that could either be the professor or a psychotic version of the professor (and while the statue looks somewhat real, it's pretty obviously fake).

Image: Pokii

Advertisement

It would be unusual for any game, let alone a Nintendo game, to have random people who aren't the main characters appear in the game. But these other people seem very imposter kidnapper-ish (although, if that's the case, then I don't know if there's a random imposter, and a bunch of imposter kidnappers, waiting to creep out unsuspecting parents), and maybe even a little bit suspicious.

If I'm not imagining things, that statue might even look a little bit imposter-ish (it's hard to tell from a screenshot, of course).

There's no way for me to know if the game is geared toward children, or whether it's up to a certain level of maturity. The funniest thing about the game's ending is that the lady doing the conversation sounds like an imposter posing as the professor, and so does the professor."

2703,"OK playing this game today is not as worth it as before and I'm sure most of you have stopped playing this game already. But still, this game is super fun with a group of friends!

Most of you already know how the game works, but unless you're one of the few who don't, lemme clear it up for you... there's a group of crewmates trying to do their work in a place, but 1-3 crewmates have a secret mission - to kill everyone. These ""impostors"" also have an ability to sabotage the ship and seal some doors, but most importantly, they have to do it without anyone else noticing.

This game has a good variety of stages, my personal favorite being the Airship, because it's so massive, it lets you choose a starting point, and is a huge reference to one of my favorite games, Henry Stickmin! Loads of customization options are available quickly and can also be purchased with money. You can even change your name tag's appearance, have a pet follow you, or be a literal horse.

Before you buy this, make sure you have friends to play this with. This game has single-player and online with strangers, but they're nowhere compared to the experience with friends! It is free to play on mobile, but if the game suits you better on PC, then go ahead and give it a go!"

2719,"The game is fun, but really only if you play with friends or acquaintances. 99% of the people in random online games just accuse each other randomly without any kind of dialogue or strategy. It's a confrontation with the average person's lazy stupidity. Many people leave a game immediately at the start when they're not the impostor, and even more people leave as soon as they're killed, instead of trying to finish the game together with the survivors. The quickchat option makes people even less likely to partake in any sort of conversation, but at least that's optional.

That said: The Among Us support account is a highlight on Twitter."

Among us is the true and real reflection on society, the colors on the suits the characters wear is a metaphor for how we see each other, while the roles symbolize our role in society. Some are known as the crew mate, also known as the average person, while the imposters, symbolize the living embodiment of the cruel and harsh atrocities a person may go through *sips tea*. Among us give you a true insight on how such imposters may affect our lives as the ordinary ""crewmate"". The many things the imposter is able to sabotage in thine game is a example on the many crossroads we have in life, do we cower in the corner, or do we strive to solve the mysteries life brings our way. And when one of thine crewmates becomes murdered, everyone in the lobby is summoned to a group meeting at the round table like our kind King Arthur once did with his noble knights years and years ago. And when thine meeting comes to order, the people must decide who the imposters may be, would the imposters succeed by deceiving all the crewmates into voting out their fellow brethren, or will they find the traitor and elimate them, that is up to thine player. This cumcludes my thesis, on the great and noble experience that is, Among us"

2821,"you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

I started playing Among Us due to the huge amount of hype from social media, content creators, and now to play with friends, and I'm glad I did. It's a great party game. It's a game where you get together with friends, community's, or even social media groups/events and try to find out who is the impostor. This game is very much better when played in a discord call with friends as the game itself only has a text-chat feature and now in-game voice-chat.

However, Among us is simply that, a casual game to play with friends and maybe once in a while a random match-making game. This game is way better with in discord, or other voice chat call with friends, as the impostor you have to manipulate your fellow ""crewmates"" to believe that you're innocent, with text chat and a limited time to vote out a player it is hard to do so in limited time.

The core gameplay hook does get boring semi-quickly, because there is minimal to work towards, only minimal cosmetics which can be obtained rather fast. This game also does not have any real progression mechanics, thus nothing mechanically to improve upon. It simply exists as a fun, party type game. Nothing more, and nothing less.

I suggest that if you to play Among Us, you download it for a reason and not waste your money. Only download if friends or a social media group wants to play, thus giving you a reason to play the game at it's best.

I hope that you have found this review useful! Please leave me a rating, and give me your thoughts/feedback in the comments, as I would love to hear any feedback, ideas, thoughts, and what personal experiences you've had with this game."

2867,"According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

2916,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

2939,"Yes, it's Among Us, it's a meme game. But it's also fun, it's probably the best way to easily and effectively play the kind of Mafia/Town of Salem or what-have-you-type game, and it's just a good social game in general. So long as things aren't too awkward or aggressive or inappropriate, this game is great fun to playfully lie with your friends or even strangers while still being able to respect one another and play the game. Maybe such a concept will be done better in the future - either in updates for this game, or a sequel, or another game altogether - but it does the concept well and it's the best out there for now."

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.

You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands.

Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

Every game I see is either Hxrnyboy, HxrnyGirl, Snxpboy, etc. Its honestly sad how downhill this game went within the past year. Now all people are, are horndogs looking to sext n shit. This game used to be a lot of fun no doubt, it still is to a certain extent, but when you're on during a specific time in the day, you cant find a match without it being those servers, or the RP Servers too. When the game first launched it was nothing like that, none of this weird bs. Devs need to try and do something about these people cause its lame asf when you just wanna play and you cant cause people ban or kick you off the rip for not wanting to sext them or do roleplay."

3121,I don't like this game very much but you should absolutely play it at least once. I'm pretty sure you don't get to go to the afterlife without this game on your resume.

3126,"I bought this a the peak of it's popularity and within the first 20 hours, I would say that I have gotten my moneys worth. The achievement are for the most part reasonable but the 150 kills and Hunger achievements are honestly just a matter of luck. After almost a total of 100 hours I have only been able to get 50 kills."

my wife left me and took the kids as soon as i got the game
but its pretty fun"
3163,"Awesome game! Sure, there are some rude people, but you can always ignore them. Other than rude people, there are so many friendly people that could be into the same things as you, and with the help of a friend list, you can friend them! There are so many features that quite a lot of people playing this game enjoy, and overall, this game is a 100% recommendation I would give to my friends!"
3164,It was pretty cool.
3165,great game to play with friends but might end up in a fight
3166,I like the mystery and using clues and it is challenging to survive as a crewmate or fake tasks as an imposter

3201,i love this game sm honestly it cures me when im bored but its hard to find servers.

3203,"What I offer: 
- finger and hand coordination
- paranoia
- paranoia
- short term memory loss

What this game expects/offers:
- card swipe perfection
- paranoia
- the ability to recall things you have seen
- paranoia
- dishonesty
- a h@rny 14 year old asking for sh!t in a public server.


Although my 120.5 hours make you believe I enjoy this, I do not. I'm here to spread chaos, you're here to buy a funny bean game. We are not the same."

3208,"All I have to say is DONT play this game at 3:00 AM in the morning, trust me guys it is not worth it. Whatever they say dont do it. IT took my kids hostage, IT killed my entire family, IT even made me listen to amongus sus hot balls remix for 10 hours strait. Guys this is not click bait *gone sexual* *cops called*, trust me on this guys, it might just save you. 6/10, game is mid"
3209,"it's ok

3210,This game is really fun to chill out and play
3211,"So when i first got this game, i thought - nobody's gonna play with me, i'll never find my tribe here - lo and behold, this game led to a plethora of new friends that i actually play with on the regular. honestly, while it's a game about betraying your friends, it's probably one that gets you the most."

3221,sussy baka game
3222,"As any online game there is the chance of trolls/ being harassed, but ignoring obvious/common problems the game is a massive hit. I do say playing with a group of friends is preferred because you can connect with your fellow 'crewmates' to try to survive the thrilling rounds.

I adore this game and the passionate community behind it. I also appreciate the care they put into the game and the updates they add to try to keep the community going and the game feeling fresh. I have hundreds of hours on this game, and expect to have many more.

There is a small learning curve for new players, but the game is pretty easy to get ahold of. Just be careful and watch out for those vents!"

3232,go
3233,it WAS a perfect game but now you are waiting for one game 15 minutes its a good game but nobody is playing it so dont buy it.
3234,"I would pay money for this game. There is a hug stigma to this game now where only weird people play it now and they all say weird things and it is all they think about. I always hate it when a fan base is the downfall of a game. This game is super smart and really fun to play. It is incredibly simple and a lot of fun. The greatest part of this game is that you can play if for HOURS and it will never be the same because how people play is always so different. Every choice has a butterfly effect and it becomes super rare for something to be repeated. Now that doesn't mean there isn't some logic in playing the game. With some skill, critical thinking and memorization you can become very good at this game. I would pay $30 for this game because of how brilliant it is."

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, I'm downin' this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste buds?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy

3282,"Among Us follows the story of a crew set on finding the center of the universe so they can find out how to create real life cat girls. Little do they know, there is a tentacle monster that wants to find the secret first so it can create really disturbing stuff on the internet.

Throughout the story, of which there are four chapters within it, the characters develop beautifully. This game has everything. It has love, suspense, cringe, amogus, shitposts, and gutwrenchingly hard to watch death scenes of our favorite characters, one of which is John Halo from the Halo series.

Overall, this game is an easy must have for all drama crime series lovers and is easily GOTY for 2002."

3355,"I have 66.6 hours in this game now, I have been playing it for so long, but ever since I got 66.6 hours in among us weird things have started to happen, i've been seeing a red figure move around in the corner of my eye. There has also been stuff being moved and disappearing. Day 1: My cat has gone missing. We think that he got outside and maybe he will come back. I woke up today and all the food in my house was gone and the basement was all wet. My brother said that he seen a weird red figure at 3am but i don't believe him. Update I cant sleep and its 3am. I just seen the weird red figure peeking in from the door as if he was trying to be sneaky. Day 2: The cat still isn't back, vet: or the food. But me and my family have been seeing red figures around the house and notice that more red things than we ever did in our lives. I went to the gym today and I could see what I swear to be the red among us character running on a treadmill, Its probably just my imagination but I don't know. Me and my family woke up at 3am again today. Its the 2nd day in a row and we couldn't go back to bed that night. I don't know what it is but I swear I seen the red among us character holding a knife. I have to be playing too much among us,is it because I always vote out red? Or is it because I'm mentally ill from playing too much among us. Whatever it is its weird and I don't like it. Day 3: All the animals in my house are gone. We have all started seeing the red creature frequently now. We have started to go to therapy because of this. No matter where we go we can't escape it. I went to my friends house today and I swear I seen him turn into the red among us character holding a knife so punched him. I got kicked out of his house and I'm never invited over again. I tried to reason with him telling him ""Dude I swear I seen you turn into the red among us character."" But he blocked me as if he didn't even believe me. At 3am today he struck. We all seen it happen. Babyninja528 got stabbed by the red among us characters. We were all in shock, We couldn't believe it. With his last breath he said that he also had 66.6 hours in among us. This had to be a sign. Maybe the 66.6 hours in among us was causing this. I don't know but I'm going to get to the bottom of this. Day 4: We are still mourning the loss of babyninja528 but right as I got out of the bed the red among us creature was standing there. ""Thank you for summoning me"" the creature said in a deep voice, then he disappeared. We still have had no food so we were all starving so we decided to go out to eat. But the server was the red among us character. We all screamed and ran out of the door as everyone around us was staring at us like they hadn't just seen what we seen. Today at 3am though was crazy. We were huddled together in the living room when it attacked. All of the lights flashed then went out. It was pitch black, we weren't prepared. We stayed together trying to find the flashlights we always keep in the dining room but then he was there. Standing in the darkness, the red among us creature. Towering over us at at least 10 feet tall with his massive knife. We all ran for our lives, Sadly my step dad was too slow as he got struck by the giant knife. As the blood splattered everywhere we could look back, we had to keep running. Once 3am was over we noticed that he doesn't attack for the rest of the night so we treated his wounds and sent him to the doctor hoping that the creature wouldn't get him. Day 5: We started to think about why this is happening to us. Our first thoughts were that it was the 66.6 hours in among us so we got on my computer and tried to play: ""Sorry but this is unavailable at the moment."" We were confused, but right as we turned around he was towering over us again. As he struck his knife we barely dodged it and we ran for it. We were away from home the whole day. We figured that maybe if we didn't sleep somewhere inside it wouldn't happen so we slept on the side of the road. Once again we woke up at 3am in a cold sweat. This time it felt different though, it felt like we were being watched but no one was around us. We got up and started moving because we couldn't go to sleep due to the strong feeling. We walked at least a mile but the feeling was still strong. As we were passing this abandoned building the red among us creature was standing there deviously ""WHAT DO YOU WANT!"" I screamed but it just said ""Thanks."" as it didn't even care that it was murdering a innocent family. We booked it running as fast as we could. We had to cross a street that was pretty busy for being 3:56am. When me and my mom were running across thought a big red car swerved out the way to hit me. My vision went black. All I could hear was a loud laughing and cars zooming past. As I was coming back I noticed that there was a ambulance rushing towards me. Once they lifted me up I started talking to them about what happened. They looked at me like I was crazy. They rushed me to the hospital and put me on amnesia so I dont remember what happened. Day 6: I woke up in the hospital bed wondering where I was, Luckily my mom was there to tell me, everything. After I learned what happened I was furious. My left leg, left arm, 6 ribs, and my right shoulder were broken. I also had a massive concussion. The day was very weird because I don't know if my head was messing with me but it looked like every once and awhile the red among us character would walk by in a nurse suit as if the creature worked there. But one of the doctors who came in to check on me was the red among us character, I screamed as loud as I could and nurses rushed in, They looked at him like it was just a normal man and not a 10 foot tall giant red among us character. Was | going crazy? No, it couldn't have been, babyninja528 had died to him it, couldn't be fake. A nurse rushed in with the news that me and my step dad would be ok. I heard a faint ""Not for long"" In a deep voice, It was him. Sam: There was no nurses around, they had all went home. There was a slight, knock on the door before it busted open making me shiver. it was him. Looking more vicious than ever. With his massive knife above his head looking like he was going to strike me down I tried to get up, I couldn't, I couldn't move. After using all of the effort in my body I had just moved enough to move out the way of the massive knife There was a pair of crutches next to me so I grabbed them and ran. I could barely move but it was enough to make a little distance. He was menacingly walking towards me as if it was a scary movie. A computer. Thats when I figured it out. It was the 66.6 hours of among us playtime. I rushed to the front desk computer and as if I was the main character it had steam on it. I had memorized my steam password because I needed to play among us on every computer seen. It let me launch it, it let me launch among us. I loaded up the game and got into a game as fast as I could. I just needed 0.01h of playtime. I was crew mate. As I heard the loud footsteps of the massive red creature approaching I didn't know if it would be enough, I couldn't run away from it I was too slow. So I just sat there waiting until I thought that the time was enough. As he was towering over me I just sat there, As it waiting to be killed. He raised his giant knife above his head saying ""Nothing will save you now."" But as soon as I heard that I Alt+F4'd my among us hoping it would be enough. I looked at the playtime and it said 66.7h. I looked at him and the massive knife 1 inch above my head as they disintegrated into dust. I survived. I was in so much joy I passed out. Day 7: I had woken up wondering what happened. ""You did it, you saved us."" My mom had said. I remembered now. I did it. I saved my family. (Besides babyninja528) We are now thought of as the crazy people in the town and some people even think that we killed babyinja528. We are now living happily 4 years later,

3357,"It's a neat little time waster.  Rounds are only 5-10 minutes long ""maybe"".

It's also a great way to lose all faith in humanity, especially when you're playing with friends.  If you've never played it, basically you're part of a whole crew of people on some ship  or other structure.  The rounds are a battle between two groups of people.  The crewmates are most players in a round, and each crewmate is given a handful of tasks they must complete.  If all crewmates complete all their tasks, they win the round.  However, the other group of players are the ""Impostors"", whose job is to kill the crewmates without being caught or found out.  Whenever somebody finds a dead body, or whenever they need to share something with the group, they can call a group meeting.  Even the impostors can call a group meeting.  During these meetings you've got about a minute to chat with one another about your findings and thoughts, and at the end of every meeting you have the option of voting to eliminate one player.  If the crewmates eliminate all the impostors, then they win without having to complete their tasks.  However, if the impostors succeed in whittling the crew down to one person, then the impostors win the match.  Crewmates can continue to perform their tasks after they're dead, but they cannot chat with any living players to tell them who killed them.

It's a really nifty psychological game where you're always questioning everybody, viewing every other player through a lens of suspicion, and it gets especially fun when you play with friends and you know one of them is out to kill you, and it's their job to lie to your face about it until the round is over.

I really like.  It's a simple concept with short rounds, but it can be a lot of fun."

3370,Amazing experience and it is very addictive. I love the strategical aspect of this game.
3371,10/10
3372,It can be fun with your friends but it got really bad updates which made the game completely unfair like engineer which makes it harder to find imposter but more importantly the guardian angel which protects crewmates from dying which is a stupid idea and the shapeshifter which literally makes the game impossible. Most public lobbies have these enabled so it makes it really hard to find a lobby with good settings

3411,"This game is really fun.I mean,imagine you and your friends are on a spaceship and one of you has to kill the rest.And also you have tasks and if you complete them you might as well go check the cameras ,maybe you'l see the impostor kill someone.if yes you have 4 options:
1.you call an emergency meting and rat them out.
2.you go report the body and say you saw them kill on the cameras.
3.you don't say anything and just stay away from that person.
4.you wait for someone else to find the body and then say you saw them but when you came to report it they were guarding it.
But if your the impostor kill them one by one while there alone.Make sure your not next to a camera,you never know when someone might be watching.by the way if you die and someone calls an emergency meeting just know that you can type all you want but they wont see your text.
Anyways i hope you enjoy the game,good bye."

Definitely a game that would be good for a few short rounds while you have a little time."
3450,"It's a fun game. I do wish the players were less vulgar at times, Among Us is really popular with kids and having someone dropping slurs and sexual references in the middle of the game is not great. Even with the censors on some people do find ways around it.
Thankfully my kid is old enough to be aware of these inappropriate things and not be too bothered by them, but it is something to keep in mind if you're considering getting this for you elementary school aged child."

3537,"lets be honest, who among us (haha side joke) really likes the imposter? All of us! My review is this, amongus is a great game suited for all ages, i have been able to get the snapchat of 2 girls in this game but that doesnt matter. never trust red, NEVER anyway i have to get back to pretending to be happy. 

Overall expirience: 9/10
Enjoyment as imposter: 10/10
Me wanting to die cause the memes have  gotten to me: 7/10
The overall stress of playing a top teir game like this on the regular, smiling the entire time while my soul has left and my body is nothing but a empty hollow corpse, that used to house a person who had a future!

10/10 game, I would reccomend"
3538,I like the community. People have been very kind to newbies who are slow to learn and have shown lots of patience.

Fortnite and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds may have popularised the last player standing format, but Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout has truly unlocked its potential by painting it hot pink and putting it in a hot dog costume. Mediatonic’s family-friendly formula is a colourful, bouncy breath of fresh air that takes a different, less explosive approach to battle royales without losing any of the tension. Instead of C4, it’s Vitamin C you’ll be steering clear of as you’re bombarded with monstrously overgrown oranges in just one of its two dozen game show-like events. The vast majority of these minigames hit the mark, offering fun and frustration in equal amounts. Couple them with a vibrant aesthetic and a brain-tunneling soundtrack and Fall Guys manages to make you want to punch the air when you’re winning and scream at your screen when you’re losing, but you’ll be laughing either way.
The concept of Fall Guys will be familiar to those that have seen game shows such as Wipeout or Takeshi’s Castle. Guide your very own customized jelly bean avatar through up to five rounds of inflatable carnage and you’ll have a shot at taking home the crown. Each match is framed as an episode and lasts around 15 minutes at most, which further drives home that TV show feel. The controls are simple with running, jumping, diving, and grabbing as your only tools to navigate obstacle courses, avoid enemies, or cling on for dear life in more survival-centered events that threaten to plunge you into the slimy depths. If you do happen to get eliminated then you have the option to watch those remaining battle it out for the title while the musical equivalent of glycerin is poured into your ears. A game show is only as good as its games though, and this is where Fall Guys’ current pool of 24 largely triumphs. The obstacle course-style races are where I’ve found the most enjoyment, especially as it gets down to the wire as beans bounce off one another and desperately lunge for the finish line trying to make the cut.
I’ve been particularly enjoying the havoc of Hit Parade and the precarious spinning platforms of The Whirlygig, which often descend into chaos as twenty too many characters try to fit through a small gaps or all jump for the same narrow platform. There’s always more than one path to take, some offering a high risk-reward option, which is welcome as it never feels like you’re completely out of a race despite being near the back of the pack. In Door Dash you hurtle towards the bottom of a track attempting to dive through doors, some of which will blast open, whereas others will stay firmly shut. There’s a simple pleasure found in walking through an opening as the opponent next to you slams face first into a brick wall. But games that rely on silly physics can often take as much as they give, as seen in See Saw, which varies from the other races in that it can become incredibly frustrating almost instantly. The whole course consists of multiple enormous seesaws, funnily enough, and largely relies on your fellow competitors understanding how these playground apparatus made for toddlers work. It’s baffling how very few of them appear to, as you’ll find yourself sliding off their hopelessly titled platforms again and again due to, you know, basic physics. Then there’s Slime Climb, which is notably more difficult than most and served as my nemesis for many of my early hours playing Fall Guys. It’s a real sorter of the wheat from the chaff as slime slowly rises and you battle the clock, your opponents, and a mountain of obstacles. While most events usually cull Fall Guys’ initial pool of 60 players by about a quarter to half each time, it wasn’t uncommon for only a handful of players to be left after this event. But there is nuance to master here, and I soon found myself able to succeed where I once so often failed, now able to consistently conquer the climb and no longer audibly groaning when it appears in the rotation.

That said, there are no offline modes in Fall Guys currently, so that mastery only came out of a lot of online losses. There’s no practice area to get to grips with the two dozen events, but more crucially there isn’t any scope for local co-op. It feels a bit of a miss to not have the option to play split-screen or against the AI in your own private matches. Most of the fun I’ve had with Fall Guys has been when playing with friends, whether that be cheering them on once I’ve already been eliminated or laughing at them as they get hurled into the abyss thanks to a 20-foot long banana. What’s a party game without a healthy dose of schadenfreude, after all?"

3552,"Played through with a group of friends and had a class time. Massive improvement on the first chapter in terms of immersion. The challenges are way more difficult, tense and enjoyable, constantly keeping you on edge. Very much felt like they expanded upon the potential of the first game and got a good balance of everything to make a good scary game. We were lucky enough to not encounter any bugs but was disappointed to see no discount or refund for purchasing the first chapter after they made it free, although it wasn't fair charging for the very small amount of content chapter 1 has to offer. However this certainly didn't ruin the experience. I feel as though £7.19 is a pretty fair price for the length of chapter this time although only just as it was short enough to complete in one 2/3 hour sitting. If you enjoyed the first game for sure worth a try. Very curious to see what direction the game goes now and if they can match or top chapter 2.

3684,"I blame this game for ruining my life. Here is the story. It was 17th of December 2020. I was ready to celebrate another Christmas alone, browsing the world of Reddit. All of a sudden, I get a ping from my Discord Server (18 members btw... Pretty popular.) I check the ping. It was from a new member. Cutegirl93. I hate that username with all my heart. I replied to Cutegirl93 asking what she wanted. She told me to get this really ""cute game with lots of egirls"" called, ""Among us."" I was OVERJOYED! Tons of egirls? Maybe I wouldn't be single by Christmas! Joy to the world! I quickly found my credit card, opened steam, bought the game. I opened it the second I bought it. I immediately joined a game to notice 5 people. ""EmilyCutie"" ""HotEboy64"" ""SmolPotato"" and ""GamerGirl"". Last guy was irrelevant. He didn't like Reddit. I immediatley asked for their discord which they all replied with it. We made a groupchat and played Among Us for the next 24 hours straight. God, it was an amazing time. I'll never forget it. I started realizing, I was falling in love. But not with EmilyCutie, But with HotEboy64. Am I gay? No. Cannot be. I refused to believe it. And I still do refuse to believe it. I am not gay. I am straight. I started flirting with all the girls to get my mind off my love for HotEboy64. God, he was so fine. But, I am straight male. Not gay. Straight. Straight male. Eventually, me and SmolPotato started dating. This was three days after the 24 hour Among Us. I wish I never asked her out. She was so nice at first. We even met IRL. That is where the problem started. She was NOT A SMALL POTATO. SHE WAS TALL. I felt so betrayed. I was heartbroken. I coped with this horrible circumstance by playing more Among Us as it makes me very happy. I played for 30 hours straight. No sleep. No communication. No lights. All I needed was Among us. I eventually left SmolPotato and I believe, If I never got that game, I would never have realized that I am in love with a emo boy, and I would never have met SmolPotato. SmolPotato if you are reading this, the food u made tasted bad. - John PS! I do still reccomend game as me and HotEboy64 are still best friends. Don't know what I would do without ya bud. If you are reading this HotEboy64, No you are not. You never would haha. You hate reviews. You think the concept is stupid. Thats one of the many things that are cool about you. Am I gay?"

Why did this game become so popular, why do people still make the same jokes that they have been for the past 2 years about this game and why are some people mentally disabled enough to still laugh at them?

Ofc the game of all time is Peppa Pig World, it is best game in the omniversal protoplexal barrel monocosm (bigger than the true omniversal godverse owo) sometimes i eat uwu cakes while playing this game, then i cry because i have no life and i play peppa pig world for over 10 hours a day uwu, i will go now, goodbye mortals who regularly play among us :3

2nd game of all time uwu"

3724,"This game is relevant to the Troubles, also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, from 1968-1998. I won't comment much more in-depth on that because I live in relative comfort in Australia, but what I can grasp is that the world as a whole is moving closer to nationalism. With that being said, I give this game a perfect rating because it caused me to think. It had a strong impression on me, causing me to think about the meaning of the current state of what's happening in the world. Sure, I still have to get up & live my life but the truth is that we ALL have hurt someone or done worse but at the end of the day, it's realizing our mistakes & thinking about the effect it has on other people. I'm very aware that things arent that cut & dry but at the same time they really are. I enjoy a AU$56.95 of entertainment once in awhile to take my mind off things but this kind of game is getting harder to come across & deserves recognition. I've seen others comments about this game starting out slow & then ending with a bang or picking up....that's life. It welcomes you in & then spanks you. Last but not least, the graphics in this game are pretty damn good so in a nutshell, if your into games that provoke emotion layered with a historically based script & great graphics then this one is worth it. Enjoy."

3737,"Just an amazing game! for 5$ you get (in my opinion) the best murder mystery titles on steam! its well balanced (though getting a bad lobby can be a bit crappy) and is super fun with friends in a vc, though be prepared to loose your vocal cords when someone you thought you could trust snaps your neck (or your ears if you snap theirs)

10/10 would kill relationships again"
3738,"sus

3739,Its a fun game to play with your friends i dont get why you have to pay for it on steam and can get if for free on mobile but you can play a lot of stuff in that game it gets boring but when you get bored you go back to the game i recommend play the game with friends its more enjoying.

i was in a server, right? and ALL OF THE CHANNELS were just among us stuff

i showed my girlfriend my champion underwear and the logo i flipped it and said ""hey babe when the underwear's sus?"" HAHA DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DINGDINGDING

i looked at a fucking trashcan and said ""hey that's a bit sussy""! i looked at my penis and it reminds me of the astronaut's helmet and i said ""PENIS? MORE LIKE PESUS!"" AAAAAAAAAAAAAA"

Thank god for quick chat and censor chat! I just ignore them, but sometimes it gets to the point of leaving the server. There are a few people that are inappropriate, but again, there are chat options. Other than that it is a nice game to play, and takes some skill. I recommend it."

3772,terrible gameplay
3773,"what can i say besides that this game has taught me a lot of valuable life lessons. The first lesson i learned was to always doubt my friends and think that they are always doing things without my knowledge and lying to me about it. The second lesson i learned was that do your daily silly lil tasks like a normal upstanding citizen yields no benefit besides getting stabbed in the back by the amongus imposter from the viral hit game, Among US. tHE THIRD and arguable the most important lesson, is that you should always sacrifice others for your own benefit. Thank you amogus, you have helped me lose custody of all my children and my 5 wives. They all blocked me on twitter.com and myspace AND facebook. I had to email mark zucky to help unban me so i can reach my baby mommas and communicate that young papi benito is here (its like the my hero academia reference when all might says im here!!). 

So remember kids, before you decide to play this game of sus, you must discuss with yourself what rlly is important to you in life. Whether its being a honorable person and still be sus or the most diabolical, inhumane, lying, conniving, and despicable person to be an imposter from AMONGUS!

3776,"Aside from calling Among Us a dead game, it has a very serious issue.

The primary problem that I run into majority of the time are teamers. They get together in a voice chat outside of the game and ruin the lobby for everyone else. Sure, it might be fun for you lot, but it ruins the whole 'social deception game' deal for the other players.
I have gone on a streak of running into three lobbies infected by teamers [b]in a row[/b]. Most people can't tell when there are teamers until they're dead, which wouldn't be a problem if you could votekick when you're dead. You can't. You have to wait until the next prelobby to get rid of them.

I have nothing against Among Us— I love the game. Finding a lobby full of competent players is rare, and having it ruined by people who 'are just memeing' is just a slap in the face of those who are playing."
3777,a disaster for the human race

3787,"boring ass game if you dont have friends
"
3788,Great if you have friends to play it with. Public lobbies tend to have cheaters and the gameplay there is often unenjoyable. Requires at least 6 people so as the matchups arent a complete joke. Very sussy.
3789,It's a good game that involves the use of strategy and social skills.
3790,Its ok
3791,dont buy this game not worth especially if you are under 18. I put in my ssn and they committed identity fraud
3792,Just based off the game.
3793,"Game is very fun to play with friends
"
3794,"Whether your just a cool bean or a sussy baka (Imposter) you'll enjoy this game, theirs also free cosmetics and all that jazz. 

The plot itself is you either trying to do your job or kill people and when a body is found or the button is pressed, everyone tries to figure out who it is, then kill their prime suspect, good thing you can come back not for vengeance, but to continue with your tasks, can't even leave a sign for the others

The creators of this game put a lot of love into it and you can tell, no glitches ever, the only thing missing is some sort of single player campaign or whatever for when the servers eventually close down"
3795,"meh, could be better, play multiversus"

3800,I like cheddar sheese

3802,The game ask for my national id ( social security number) in order to make an account. I refuse to give this information. Since they can take out loans and make purchases in my name.
3803,"This game is fun. The people who play are honestly keeping me away more than the gameplay, updates are amazing lately and the option to either keep or remove safechat are awesome. I recommend this game to others and hope you'll have fun playing aswell!"

"
3837,"I know it's a meme game but Among Us is still a surprisingly good time. I worried the new additions would make jumping back in confusing but the new roles are all pretty straightforward and don't distract from the main gameplay, even if some of them feel pretty useless (the Medic especially). My only problem with it is, who the hell has 15 friends?"
3838,"I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far

Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
I spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of '69, oh

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever
Forever, no
Yeah

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of '69, uh-huh
It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah

Me and my baby in '69, oh, oh
It was the summer, summer, summer of '69"

4013,"Among Us: A game where nobody can be your friend.
Among Us is an online multiplayer social deduction game, with something of horror. Ambient in the space, you will must complete your tasks as a crewmate. Kill everyone and sabotage the nave as the impostor. Save lives as an Angel. See the life of the rest of players in your tablet as a scientist. And a lot more funny roles.
You will must be like Sherlock to find the impostor and win the game.
You will prefer staying alone to staying with someone, because that ""someone"" may kill you. ¿Can you survive and win the game?
Among Us, a game where your shadow is your worst enemy."
4014,"Among Us in real life (sus, sus)
Among Us in real life (sus, sus)
Playing Among Us in real life, spaceship with my crew
Gonna split up, spread out 'cause we all got tasks to do
Gotta find the imposter as they try to sabotage
Who can we trust in this Among Us entourage?
Heard a sound, turned around, looking up, looking down
Then I find a dead body
Gotta blow the horn, emergency discussion, who should we believe?
Can't decide, so, now we leave, not sure what I'm about to see
Will it be a dead body? Still have a task I must complete
Who's the impostеr?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can wе trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
I'm a ghost, I'm my biggest fear, got killed by the imposter
I was playing in the game, but now I'm just a watcher
I'm paying attention using my 360 vision
If it gets quiet, I listen
Make sure there's nothing I'm missing
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
It wasn't me (or me)
It definitely wasn't me
No one can be trusted because someone is lying
We still have tasks to do, so, let's split up so we can win
Everyone is sus so let this last round begin
There's an imposter among us
Trying to take something from us
We're still over here working
While she's just ghosting above us
Someone's under suspicion
Sabotaging our mission
Doing my task in the kitchen
Until I stop, look, and listen
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
I'm the I-M-P-O-S-T-E-R, that's me
While everyone's doing tasks, I'm going through vents on a killing spree
Yeah, I'm sus in Among Us
We can discuss whoever took your life
But if you think you're running this game, oh-yeah
That's me holding this knife
I'm the imposter
Looking sus, who can we trust?
I'm the imposter
Looking sus, who can we trust?

4024,Jesus wasn't in the game and i find that very insulting as a christian
4025,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

He says that he needs to be ""sus"" and is the ""impostor"". My son KILLED my husband and told me that I can't ""report"" the body other wise the other crewmates will think he is ""sus"" and that he would be ""ejected"". This game has completely corrupted my son, he would of never done ANYTHING like this before playing this game. I am so dissapointed that this game is still on the store. It is making kids the ""impostor"" and they are literally committing crimes. Why is this still up?"

4043,"Why did you add a timeout in a lobby while waiting on players to join, when a player exits one to many times there's a lockout when you try and join another one. and not to sound rude but bots would be an epic update to avoid these timeout and lock down problems."

I started playing Among Us chiefly do the huge amount of requests I got from friends and viewers to check it out. And I'm glad I did. It's a great party game. It's a game where you get together with friends, and have a big WHODUNIT match, very much like an interactive board game, but better. It's a LOT of fun, when you have people to play with.

However, you have to understand that Among Us is simply that. A casual, party game meant to be played with friends. It's not a game that requires a great amount of skill, just the ability to be a detective, and see through people's lies. Or, when you are the imposter, it requires you to be an excellent liar. It's definitely a game worth playing, but it isn't a game that you should take and replace your life with.

The core gameplay loop does get boring relatively quickly, because there is nothing to work towards, nor does it have any real progression mechanics. It simply exists as a fun, round-by-round type game. Nothing more, and nothing less.

Why do I recommend against buying it? Only because the mobile version exists. The PC version is just the mobile port, but while the mobile version is free-to-play, the PC version is $5 normally, or $4 on sale.

I suggest that if you to play Among Us, that you save your money, download the BlueStacks Android emulator, and play it on there for free instead. That's what I wish I did.

I hope you found this review helpful! Please leave me a rating, and give me your thoughts in the comments, as I would love to hear feedback, ideas, and what personal experiences you've had with this title.

4056,"Trust is impossible!
Just like reality."
4057,This game ruined my eyes
4058,"I brought this game with a DLC pack but now i have to sign in, i can't use the DLC and can't talk freely as well!
So i don't recommend this game if you want to play with friends and don't have discord."
4059,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

4066,"Among Us in real life (sus, sus)
Among Us in real life (sus, sus)
Playing Among Us in real life, spaceship with my crew
Gonna split up, spread out 'cause we all got tasks to do
Gotta find the imposter as they try to sabotage
Who can we trust in this Among Us entourage?
Heard a sound, turned around, looking up, looking down
Then I find a dead body
Gotta blow the horn, emergency discussion, who should we believe?
Can't decide, so, now we leave, not sure what I'm about to see
Will it be a dead body? Still have a task I must complete
Who's the impostеr?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can wе trust?

Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
I'm a ghost, I'm my biggest fear, got killed by the imposter
I was playing in the game, but now I'm just a watcher
I'm paying attention using my 360 vision
If it gets quiet, I listen
Make sure there's nothing I'm missing
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?

It wasn't me (or me)
It definitely wasn't me
No one can be trusted because someone is lying
We still have tasks to do, so, let's split up so we can win
Everyone is sus so let this last round begin
There's an imposter among us
Trying to take something from us
We're still over here working
While she's just ghosting above us
Someone's under suspicion
Sabotaging our mission
Doing my task in the kitchen
Until I stop, look, and listen
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?

I'm the I-M-P-O-S-T-E-R, that's me
While everyone's doing tasks, I'm going through vents on a killing spree
Yeah, I'm sus in Among Us
We can discuss whoever took your life
But if you think you're running this game, oh-yeah
That's me holding this knife
I'm the imposter

4089,"NO I will NOT provide a CREDIT CARD or SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER and other private information to unlock features! For a friend, the game has incorrect birthday data somehow showing he is 2 years old and there is no way to correct it without sending an email to a ""Guardian."" Then the ""guardian"" has to prove they are an adult by providing a credit card number or by providing private information INCLUDING SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER...  Uh no... So, he doesn't want to play because it is much harder to play without being able to CHAT so I guess I will refund the game."

4106,"Among us is a great game to play for a short while with friends and if you're feeling lucky random people. My biggest complaint is not something innersloth can control and that is the fans and player base. They have completely ruined this game for me. It is physically impossible to go an entire day without hearing ""amog us"" ""sus"" ""among us imposter ""sussy baka"" like please leave me alone it's 2 years old now it's not funny anymore. When I was at a sleepover we were watching a show and all I could see is the among us character over and over again. I won't give a negative review because this game does not deserve that but STOP POSTING ABOUT AMONG US I'M TIRED OF SEEING IT!"

WARNING!: No Indica. Sativa only.
You will need to be observant and on your toes to keep track of your backstabbing friends, so keep a clean head. Not to mention trying to figure out some of the tasks your first time through can require more of you attention that you might have first thought. Not saying they are difficult, just saying it would help if your eyes weren't nearly as squinty, so see the warning above. You will soon find out that all of your friends are lying SBs, but hopefully you are all chill enough to laugh it off and have a good time."
4126,This is the game ever

4158,"I am a 49 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

4217,"As black took his shirt off and revealed his muscles chest.Red's face got
even redder .. if that was possible.He was cornered in electrical;He was
alone with black imposter .. Black grabbed red's wrists and pinned them
against his head and against the wall.Black smashed his lips onto red's,
pulling into a passionate but rough kiss.Red let out quiet groans in
enjoyment.Black slowly pulled away and opened his mouth to speak.
There was an awkward silence for a few moments ..
Black smirked.""Are you sure you wanna do this ..?""Black asked with his
lips dangerously close to reds ..
Red nodded in assurement and slowly unbuttoned his own suit to
reveal his 6 inch throbbing cock.
Black smirked wider at the sight of red's cock.Black ripped open his suit
quickly .. Black's cock was hard and long,it was about 9 inches.
Red got on the floor and his ass was pointed upwards and his elbows
were rested on the floor .. Black took a few moments to stare at red's
throbbing asshole and cock.Black rammed his cock into red's anus.
Black imposter gave his time to let red get used to his huge size.Tears
streamed down the crew mates face in pain,but the pain quickly turned
into pleasure.Black thrusted hard into red rapidly,going inhuman
speeds.Red moaned loudly at every thrust.
""IMPOSTER~!""Red screamed loudly
Red was at his limit and cummed onto black's dick.Black wasn't near
his limit yet though.
""Jerk me off for me,will ya?""
""Y-yes ..""
Red jerked black off and black groaned,cumming like a fountain.
Suddenly green came through the cum covered vents in shock.Green
gasped.
""Oh .. my .. I'M SORRY WTF ...""
""Care to join us ...?""Black smirked."

I have not played it that much, and to be fair I only played this with a group of people I knew, where we were all in discord, and I've got to say the ability to speak and try and bluff your way out of being a sussy backer is where the game excels...however the game as it is, if you were to play it just on its own I don't find it compelling. That being said for what I played of it I enjoyed it and would recommend you find a group of people who are all competitive and let the chaos commence, 7/10 take it or get jettied off the ship!"

4297,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories. Only suggest they please add sex."

4352,"It may have originally come out in 2018, but Among Us took 2020 by storm, and it's deserving of that spotlight. Innersloth has made the tense, multiplayer fun of in-person cloak and dagger games like Mafia and Werewolf work on PC, mobile, and consoles with a flourish. And the great times I've had slaying, lying, and sleuthing my way through its charming sci-fi world got me wondering why it took so long for this sort of game to catch on. There are still a few technical hitches to be worked out, just like the fussy engines on the Skeld, but that hasn't kept me from coming back to it again and again in my down time.

The premise of Among Us is simple enough that just about anyone can pick it up quickly: eight crew members dash around a claustrophobic, cartoon spaceship to complete simple minigames and fill up a shared progress bar. But among them are two hidden impostors with the goal of secretly murdering everyone until they equal or outnumber the crew and claim victory. And yet, like so many excellent multiplayer games, it's very tricky to master because it’s about fooling real people, not gaming an AI. You can't even fall back on the same successful strategies too often or your opponents will catch on, so sometimes you have to mix things up and maybe even act illogically to keep them guessing.

The art is whimsical, with your bulbous, quirky astronauts stumbling around engine bays and reactor decks that look like the doodles I used to do in the margins of my notes in school. This is effective for a couple of reasons. For one, it keeps the mood pretty light, which is important in a game where you're going to be lying to, and being lied to, by your friends every single round. It's hard to take getting ganked in the middle of a task for the fifth time too personally when the animation for your demise makes you laugh after you're done yelling. The art style also makes interacting with the various machines and doodads on the map intuitive and enjoyable. I was able to drop right into my first match and get a decent grasp of what was going on without needing much help.

The tasks the crew will be rushing to complete present a good variety of tiny minigames, from finishing a simple maze to connecting colored wires. Most of them will test memory or hand-eye coordination in a way that requires you to keep your cool, which can be a challenge when you know there are murderers running around, out for your blood. The fact that most of the minigames cover up a significant portion of your screen is a really effective way to build tension, too. Even tasks like Download, which just makes you sit and watch a progress bar fill up, have me going, ""Come on… come onnn!"" Any movement at the edges of my monitor could mean impending death, and you know skilled impostors will use these blind spots to their advantage.

Playing as the impostor is definitely the most fun for me, and it requires a variety of skills to do well. Isolating your target so no one witnesses the crime is the easiest way to get away with it, but if you do get caught by only one other person, being able to pin the kill on them by lying over in-game text chat or an external voice app like Discord can save you from being cast out. Impostors can also use the well-placed vents on each map to flee the scene, but you have to be careful not to be spotted in two disconnected rooms in a way that makes it clear you took a shortcut. But I enjoy being on the other side as well: As a crewmate, it's a thrilling detective game to try and keep track of where everyone is, who they were with, and poke holes in their alibis at each meeting in a way that will convince the other players to vote them off the ship.

It's delightfully satisfying to lead either the impostor or the crew team to victory, because much like in poker, you're playing the other players more than anything. If you group up with the same people often enough, you can pick up on their tells. Some of my friends will stay dead silent if they're impostors, while others will start yelling and trying to direct the blame on anyone else the second the first body is found. There's a lot of mental juggling that goes into sussing out a killer, because you have to remember when and where you saw everyone and, ideally, ask the right questions to catch them in a lie without making it too obvious that's what you're doing. Then, you need to make a compelling case. Because even if you know who the impostor is 100 percent, that won't matter if you can't convince the other voters.

Some of my favorite impostor rounds have been those in which I coasted to victory in a public game by changing my handle to something unassuming, like ""joey07"", and acting like I'm a young kid who doesn't really understand the rules that well. Aside from how I type and what I do or do not choose to comment on, I can even make a big show of having a hard time getting around the ship or not understanding how crew tasks work. Knowing how to perform innocence, even to the point that you half believe you're innocent yourself, is a great skill to have. But it's a common enough strategy that if you overdo it, at this point, experienced players will catch on. So sometimes I have two cover identities: one that's way too obvious, and another that I want my opponents to figure out and think that's the final layer. But it's not. The mind games can get really deep, and they're my favorite part of Among Us.

4353,this is kinda sus
4354,i like t because i find myself cming back to it even tho i never get imposter
4355,kinda sussy
4356,Among us is a very very fun way to lose friends if you know what your doing. Among is really fun if you have friends to play it with but if you have no friends and try to do pubs its hell. So in summary if you want to have fun get friends to play it with. ඞ

4371,"This game is both incredibly fun and can be incredibly frustrating. I LOVE playing with my friends. I do not like playing with strangers. It's a great strategy game and lots of fun when you don't have random trolls purposely upsetting the balance, or people who rage quit when they get got."
4372,Among us.
4373,"I can't fucking take it. I see an image of a random object posted and then I see it, I fucking see it. ""Oh that looks kinda like the among us guy"" it started as. That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a fridge that looked like among us, I'd see an animated bag of chips that looked like among us, I'd see a hat that looked like among us. And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than ""sus."" I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is ""red sus"" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word ""among"" is ruined. The phrase ""among us"" is ruined. I can't live anymore. Among us has destroyed my fucking life. I want to eject myself from this plane of existence. MAKE IT STOP!"

4379,"The unenlightened masses
They cannot make the judgment call
Give up free will forever
Their voices won't be heard at all
Display obedience
While never stepping out of line
And blindly swear allegiance
Let your country control your mind
Live in ignorance
And purchase your happiness
When blood and sweat is the real cost
Thinking ceases, the truth is lost
Don't you worry
You'll be told exactly what to do
I give my people the lives they need
The righteous will succeed
The fires of greed will burn the weak
So we'll make freedom obsolete
Making whole the fabric of society
Collective consciousness controlled as you will see
MIND CONTROL
Let your country control your soul
Let your country control your soul
Let your country control your soul
Let your country control your soul"

I can’t stop thinking about his big red schlong destroying my anus until it’s as red as the impostor from the hitgame Among Us. I hope I can ever meet him. I would stroke his chest, give him a big slap on his butt that was hidden behind that hot latex astronaut suit. I want him in my ass, I want him to fill my twitching butthole with everything he got. This is how my wet dreams end every single day, I can’t stop thinking about the impostor of the hitgame Among Us."

4401,"Among Us is a wonderful, tear jerking game. The constant struggle of the characters give light to a deep and well written story. The dynamic world building within this game is absolutely stunning, once you think they can't go further with expanding the universe, they add more lore in which brightens and deeply expands a beautiful world.

In other words, this game is absolutely worth it. 10/10 would Sus again."
4402,We all know about the game. Funny Hee Hoo Amoguds.
4403,v fun
4404,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=====================================================================================
Its a fun game but only if you are in a voice call with a large group of friends. 
Don't even bother with public lobbies......they are       a b s o l u t e l y     garbage.
My only ''pet peeve'' with this game is that people wont take anyone serious in public lobbies, you'll get voted out for no reason other then being ''SUS'' which makes a it a little less fun if your serious and trying to play solo. Or that most people in public lobbies will IMMEDIATELY leave after not getting the 'imposter' role. 
I think they could change that by making the 'crewmate' role a little bit more fun to play instead of doing tasks which can get repetitive really quick. but i guess that they are already kinda doing that with the new roles they made, engineer,scientist, etc but its overall pretty fun.
=====================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TLDR: The game is really good and super fun with the right people, and the right settings.                             
           The community is mostly it's biggest flaw.

(+) I DO: Recommend this game if you have a discord for this game or something  and a LARGE group of-
              -nice people to play this game with.Which is often hard to get together imo. 
(-) I DON'T: Recommend this game if you play solo in public lobbies then your better off playing-        
              -something else that's more solo friendly.

my take--
overall a pretty decent game 7/10
10/10 as a party game with friends"

4413,"While not my favorite, Among Us deserves praise for its breakthrough in making social deduction games more popular to the general audience. The popularity was well deserved too, as a game Among Us is extremely solid. Especially with the new roles being added. Every match feels fluid and there is a fair amount of skill expression on both sides, though I do wish there were more options in that regard. I believe if you have a group of friends this will be a solid choice to go to for years to come. It's cheap too, so an easy recommendation"

While the giants of the industry were measuring exclusives and royal battles, gaming hearts were quietly led away by Among Us – a budget indie from the little-known InnerSloth studio. A couple of years ago, it went completely unnoticed in the flow of blockbusters, and in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the release miraculously found a second life – and, as usual, conquered the Internet. What is so special about the brainchild of a small team from Washington State?

Its essence is simple and known to many: a group of people gathers together, tries on various roles (detective, doctor, and so on) and looks for encrypted gangsters in their ranks. Meanwhile, criminals are trying to quietly destroy rivals, cover their tracks – in a word, get away with it. One, two, three, the city falls asleep, and an ordinary apartment turns into the scene of a detective story, where everyone is for himself. Who is the killer? Who should I send to prison? Why does he have such a suspicious face?

A simple concept, dozens of subtleties and a huge scope for psychological manipulation provided Dmitry Davydov's creation with a long life and worldwide recognition. And where there is fame, there are imitations. And in 2017, the small InnerSloth team decided to present their version of the ""social RPG"".

The ambitions of the developers from Redmond were moderate – just to make a ""space"" version of the famous board game, but with local multiplayer, so that you could have unusual fun with friends at parties. No one counted on a triumph – if only the idea somehow paid off, and then come what may. The trio found a bright visual style, added unusual mechanics to the familiar formula, thought through everything to the smallest detail and after a long polishing sent Among Us to conquer the App Store and Google Play. Alas, unsuccessfully.

In 2018, no one simply noticed the novelty: it was not written about in digests, it was not discussed on forums, and even specialized sites passed by the curious premiere. Such an offensive fiasco crippled the young team, but, contrary to common sense, InnerSloth continued to work on its creation. It didn't bring much profit, of course, but the studio had money for a rainy day, and a handful of users had sound ideas and suggestions about edits. What's not a reason to spin online, make a port on a PC and release a couple of DLC locations for ridiculous money? The decision is risky... and, as it turned out, absolutely right. In the long run.

By the end of 2019, stories about companionable indie had quietly spread all over the world – word of mouth, people shared their delight about the ""cosmic Mafia"" and its fascinating gameplay, recommended the ""stickler"" to friends, relatives and loved ones. In a couple of countries (Korea and Brazil) she even managed to become a cult in her own way - however, the multiplayer fun turned into a global phenomenon only in the summer of 2020: in just a couple of hot months, a pandemic and several popular streamers managed to bring the once failed release into the category of recognized hits. Whatever you say, the stars have converged. So much so that the servers collapsed under the weight of the fame gained in a matter of weeks.

But a sharp rise, of course, in itself does not mean anything: you never know in the industry of caliphs for an hour. Nevertheless, even if her popularity is short–lived, Among Us fully deserves all those delights in her address - this is not a pathetic clone of a desktop legend, but a small masterpiece confidently standing on its own feet.

[h1]Positive:[/h1]
1. Incredibly addictive gameplay.
2. Well-tailored mechanics.
3. Huge scope for manipulation and bluffing.
4. Excellent visual style.
5. An abundance of settings.
6. Cross-play.
7. Low PC price and no price tag on smartphones.

[h1]Minuses:[/h1]
1. Servers sometimes work through a stump deck.
2. Rare cheaters like to spoil the fun of playing with strangers.

[h1]Result:[/h1]

At first, you don't expect miracles from Among Us – how many trinkets have gone viral in recent years, about which there is absolutely nothing to say after years? Nevertheless, the broken clock shows the exact time twice a day: the Internet sensation turned out to be quite worthy of people's love.

The game is a miracle how good: it's addictive, bright, well thought out, and fun even in a group with strangers – it's amazing that only three little-known game designers made such a talented work from all sides. However, rather than repeating yourself once again, it is better to emphasize the main advantage of an indie hit: the brainchild of InnerSloth is able to please everyone, regardless of preferences. That children, that adults, that ""casual"", that hardened gamers – multiplayer fun is able to conquer anyone. Moreover, if the original ""Mafia"" seems to be a waste of time, there is still a great chance that its cosmic variation will capture you for dozens of hours – checked.

But why just trust someone's beautiful words - the mobile version of Among Us can be downloaded for free, so nothing prevents you from evaluating the phenomenon and making a verdict yourself. Join the friendly ranks of colorful astronauts, install Discord and go into orbit in search of adventures! Just be careful in a room with electricity – as a rule, very strange things are happening there.

To prove that I am the correct age to be a guardian, a SSN or credit card number is required, including a first and last name and an address. This is completely unnecessary and I am getting a refund.  I uninstalled and installed twice, and even went into the PlayerPerf files of the game under %AppData% and changed my birthday on there. Nothing worked.

The actual gameplay is still decent if you can get around the whole ""making an among us account"" bullshit (which you need to do in order to play with other people who are using the chat option freely).

Just use the mobile version. It's free. Same problems with the game but at least you dont waste money if you mess up the age thing one time"

4557,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

Having to complete various microgames to fulfill a win condition is also my favorite thing about the game.

4715,"Back in 2020 at the peak of quarantine this was the best game to enjoy with friends, the laughs and arguments that we had because of it were amazing, playing every night the 10 of us. Really enjoyable."
4716,"A dark and malignant plague which infects even the strongest of wills. If you play this affront to nature you will be contaminated as you say amogus in a blind insanity. Your mouth will contort as you slowly become a belligerent buffoon accusing your comrades with eyes that have lost all hope and peer into the void like an abandoned puppet left to rot in the piles of waste left behind by our ancestors. To play this game is to realize that death is truly a blessing if it means we no longer live in a world inhabited by this unholy abomination. Friedrich Nietzsche once said, “Without music, life would be a mistake.” but clearly he wasn't around to see this abhorrent creation for not even music could validate our existence if among us roams our reality. In conclusion, it was okay."

Story: None.
Gameplay: Amazing, Perfect Controls That Are Reasonable And is Fully Accessible.
Graphics: Really Interesting And Smooth graphics that don't need a beefy computer to run.
Overall: Amazing Game with one huge con... the co-op. Yes, the game needs it to function as an actual game, but unless your only playing with friends it's just kind of annoying to play because hackers flood public servers, And people sometimes purposefully ruin the experience. It's Great To Play, But People just suck man, I know this is a big meme and whatever, and this is great. Be aware though
ඞා
"
4798,"Ok i'll be honest this game is fun its interesting and overall a good game to have fun with

The downsides is that if you're playing public lobbies its just toxic people assholes, you get voted out for doing nothing theres teamers theres hackers and other bullshit that devs just can't do anything about
they do nothing YES NOTHING about hackers and harssment being bullied every single time playing this game is fucking horrible 

Then they had to add account systems and a shit store.

Overall a good time but its also really shit a the same time"

An absolute must-have if you're looking for a fun multiplayer for friends and you love a bit of spook and suspense! I especially love that they're constantly making improvements and changes to the game that not only enhance the overall quality, but make things fair and fun for the community. You can tell a lot of love went into this game, and continues to be a thing well into their popularity."

He says that he needs to be ""sus"" and is the ""impostor"". My son KILLED my husband and told me that I can't ""report"" the body other wise the other crewmates will think he is ""sus"" and that he would be ""ejected"". This game has completely corrupted my son, he would of never done ANYTHING like this before playing this game. I am so dissapointed that this game is still on the store. It is making kids the ""impostor"" and they are literally committing crimes. Why is this still up?"

4949,"This game has caused agony...

It was a regular day, I woke up, booted up my PC, and opened Discord and Among Us. I then got into my usual vc (Among Us Game #1) to find that, including me, there were 11 total people. I was beyond devastated and nearly started crying until one of my friends said that they have to go, and that I could now play among us. However, my one friends, whomst I will call ""Alex"", did not like that I ""replaced"" his best-friend in his among us game. Alex proceeded to run nearly 40km to my house. Upon arriving, he set up a camera outside of my parent's room and waited for my dad to leave to go to work. After my father was out of the house, he snuck in through my parent's window and started flirting with my mother... Alex left around 3 hours later with all the footage he needed to end my parents relationship and ruin my life... After my dad had seen what my mother had done via e-mail, he rushed home as soon as possible to pack his things, take us, and leave. I am currently writing this review in a denny's after two days of being on the road. Dad has already spent all of the money he brought with us on alcohol and gas, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to play among us ever again...

But overall, the gameplay is fairly solid, I give it a 10/10!"

4961,I like it
4962,"I hate this game. It is fun to play every once in a while but without friends it is a mess. 

Public lobbies have an average IQ of 0 and don't listen to logic or reason, and just vote people out with no discussion whatsoever. The only way to have an interesting and compelling game of Among Us is to get a group of friends to play, and look at me, do I look like I have that many friends?

It is also terribly programmed. Glitches and bugs galore. Even game breaking bugs that have existed since the beginning of the game that have never been fixed.

For example, you can do a task, it will register as done in the task list, but the arrow will be pointing to it for the rest of the game. NICE! The game will just decide you aren't allowed to play anymore and leave you with a black screen after a meeting and not let you move. COOL! Or how about this? I've had it happen where I vote for someone, legit click the check next to their name, and the game decides to cast my vote on some random schmuck. THANKS GAME!

And don't get me started on the server list. I can newly refresh the server list, click INSTANTLY on a game with 4 of 15 people in and the game will tell me it is full. REALLY? I doubt there were just 11 people DYING to get into that lobby. And it will show me games that have already started in a newly refreshed server list. I doubt that they started JUST as I refreshed the list EVERY SINGLE TIME.

The ONLY thing this game has going for it is the character customization, which I actually really like. It is expansive and detailed. Lots of props and stuff to give your character.

And to be 100% fair, this is so much better than the mobile port. The controls are better and it is easier to do a lot of stuff. However that isn't enough to save it from all the filth that plagues the game. Not super mad that I bought it, but definitely will not be playing it often"

5101,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

5107,i like it
5108,"yeah man 
"
5109,its good
5110,heeeeeeeeeheh
5111,its fun with freands
5112,"… Ok, ok, I see what's happening here
You're face to face with greatness, and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change
… Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me, it's Maui
Breathe it in
I know it's a lot
The hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demi-god
… What can I say except, ""You're welcome""
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy
… Hey
What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yea high?
This guy
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below?
You're lookin' at him, yo
Oh, also I lassoed the sun
You're welcome
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze
You're welcome
To fill your sails and shake your trees
… So what can I say except you're welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay
You're welcome
Ha, I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome
You're welcome
… Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly I could go on and on
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was Maui just messing around
I killed an eel
I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts
What's the lesson?
What is the take-away?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on a break-away
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been
I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini-Maui just tickety-tappin'
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha, hey)
… Well, anyway let me say, ""You're welcome"" (you're welcome)
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome (you're welcome)
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go (hey)
… Hey, it's your day to say, ""You're welcome"" (you're welcome)
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome (you're welcome)
'Cause Maui can do anything but float
… You're welcome
(You're welcome)
You're welcome
And thank you"

5131,teaches very important skills like gaslighting
5132,No nude...uninstall
5133,"You disconnected from the server.

DTLS negotation failed after 37 resends (7610 ms)."
5134,yeah great game they might just have to change things up a bit more often because i find it gets boring after a while.but if i am bored it cures my boredom quite well.

5143,"As fun as it is, there are several small things I have against this game.  Sorry, while I occasionally find it fun for custom games with no one but friends, the fact that a single person can ruin this game is a problem and the updates aren't for everyone.  If there was a way to enable only the original rules and colors then I'd come back but for now, I can't recommend this game to anyone."
5144,This was the game of all time.
5145,"It's a fun team-playing game, you never know what to expect and who's actually sus"
5146,no
5147,overrated game that gets boring after like an hour or two
5148,"I like this game due to it's ability to allow you to use knowledge and strategies rather than just run around, it brings a fun concept to doing some tedious things."

5204,Among us goes hard with prox
5205,this game is very sus
5206,"The game Among Us is about a crew being sabotaged by an Impostor, and they have to work together to fix their base and find out who's the Impostor before the Impostor itself sabotages the whole base or kills every single crewmate.
There are 6 different roles in this game; 4 of them being only for crewmates and 2 for impostors. There are the normal roles; Crewmate and Impostor. Sometimes, you'll get lucky and become a Scientist crewmate, which can check who is alive and who isn't by a low-battery tablet. There's the Engineer crewmate, who can go inside the vents to fast travel from one place to another. If you die by the Impostor, you can become a Guardian Angel, which can temporarily protect a crewmate from danger. For the impostor, there's only 1 extra role: ShapeShifter. The ShapeShifter can change their appearance to another crewmate for a limited time.
There are 4 maps with unique and usually easy tasks. This game isn't gory and is pretty much for everyone that has half a brain. The game is pretty fun but I'd only recommend it if you have friends to play with because public servers can be a real pain in the ass. It's obviously a detective game and it does a pretty good job with that, you can make your own private/public lobbies and customize the player speed, role chances, etc. Very good and I would still buy this game if its price went up to like 30%+."

5222,"I suggest Among Us should add a feature to let players joined back to their room after they accidentally left the game due to internet issue or other kind of error. Furthermore, allow players to check the stat of current game while playing in the game should be allowed as well, because sometimes players doesn't quick enough to read all the rules set by host."

He says that he needs to be ""sus"" and is the ""impostor"". My son KILLED my husband and told me that I can't ""report"" the body other wise the other crewmates will think he is ""sus"" and that he would be ""ejected"". This game has completely corrupted my son, he would of never done ANYTHING like this before playing this game. I am so dissapointed that this game is still on the store.

I was so sad that i and to pay 50 cents just for some controls. I messaged Innersloth about the issue and nothing seems to work to get me to my correct age. I tried to uninstall the game so many times just to get my age to 22. I think among us is stupid now that i have to use the auto chat and they have a new friends list but I cant add my friends because of this stupid parent feature. I get they are worried about the parents worry for the kids, but it auto went to age one. Please fix this or i will never play the game ever again. Good bye, for now. See you in court."

5274,"Among Us[c] is a 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American game studio Innersloth. The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing. The game allows for cross-platform play, first being released on iOS and Android devices in June 2018 and on Windows later that year in November. The game was then ported to the Nintendo Switch in December 2020, and on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in December 2021. While the game was initially released in 2018 to little mainstream attention, it received a massive influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. A separate VR version of the game, Among Us VR, will be released for Quest 2, SteamVR, and PlayStation VR, developed by Schell Games.

Among Us takes place in a space-themed setting where players look like colorful armless cartoon astronauts; however, since the release of ""The Skeld"" spaceship, three other maps have been added in later years: the skyscraper ""MIRA HQ"", the ""Polus"" planetary station, and ""The Airship"" (based on Infiltrating the Airship from the Henry Stickmin series, also developed by Innersloth). Each player takes on one of two roles—most are Crewmates, but a small number play Impostors—which does not alter their appearance.[d] The goal of the Crewmates is to either identify and vote out the Impostors, or to complete all the tasks around the map; the goal of the Impostors is to covertly sabotage the mission either by killing the Crewmates before they complete all their tasks or by triggering a disaster that is not resolved in time."

5299,"honestly, this game has just gotten boring. it is paid. you need to make an account. you might not even be able to turn off quick chat! (I couldn't) I originally had my username as ""JD"" but then, out of nowhere it just got randomized. even mods that add 1 more new role are refreshing. the base game   is    getting stale. plus the declining player base. innersloth knows their game is failing. half the player base is gone from late 2021. it took almost a year to get friends, a delayed 3rd map. (which honestly was disappointing) cosmicubes are basically TF2 contract rip-offs. (btw go play TF2 its free) but back on topic of among us. among us, no innersloth, has honestly failed. they made a game destined to fail as a cash grab.                                                                         .

5356,"Let me be clear about my true intentions of this review. I aim to bring every detail of this game to light to truly see how well it has performed in my giant fun cortex. First, you join a lobby. Here's the problem. The main menu is how you join the lobby, but there happens to be floating among us characters in space suits. The problem? I couldn't even stop licking my screen before even JOINING A LOBBY. How are we supposed to play your game if we are too busy thoroughly enjoying the menu? Next, I finally managed to pry my eyes (and tongue) off of my monitor and began to wait for the game to start. You know what else is in the lobby? Among. Us. Characters. Before I even realized what was happening, I ferociously leaped on top of the monitor and just started tasting every single color of among us character on my screen. Last time on the menu, I was able to make myself stop, but this time I kept going for hours until i started crying from how painful it was to continue. I had licked my tongue raw. I cannot recommend this game more from the sheer enjoyment I had at this time, but please be cautious. You may end up with a raw tongue and saliva stains all over the screen."
5357,Factually epic!!!!!!!!

5359,"Despite being an adult I am still required to verify my ""guardians"" email. No verification email has been received despite several attempts. Cheating is still rampant. And because of the restrictions due to me being seen as a child I can only use the ""quick"" chat. It's so fast that when you are accused everyone has voted before you can say a word in your defense. Nobody even plays this game like it's supposed to be. It's all about the stupid memes."

5369,"During the pandemic this game became really popular and I was one of them who downloaded it when I heard and saw it being played. It had actually been out for a while but suddenly blew up and I can see why. It is so much fun to play. It has a very simplistic art style but the tasks and maps were well thought out. And the whole premises of the game was simple, find the killer before they kill everyone on board a ship. But you have to go up against other people who are defending themselves and lying to try to pin it on someone else. Yet that is where the fun is. Just trying to figure out “who did it”.

I didn’t really play much because I don’t have very many people to play with and the ones I do live in different time zones so it’s hard to get together to play. And I don’t like to play in the public maps because the times I did they were rude and I couldn’t keep up with them, so I didn’t try. But I always have fun when I get to play. I’m not very good at lying but I tried and was able to win once or twice, but even if I lost it was still fun. I look forward to playing again."

5423,In the middle of the game people just randomly point fingers at you when your the imposter. 0/10 Never playing again and If I could get a refund I would
5424,"May i start this review by saying, What a freaking game... You may look at this game and think its meant for little kids. You may think you would not enjoy it because of how simple it looks. Let me tell you this game will show you who your friends are and how good they are at lying to your face, Its like UNO but with direct lying and  trust issue's cutting out the middle man of draw cards and skips. I have seen some of the nicest people i know fool everyone with webs of lies and win alot of rounds. It makes you stop and wonder about your life and where you went wrong. Its like when you start listening to tupac again and your tearing up thinking about how we gotta start making changes. 
         In conclusion let me leave you with this, If you are a nice person with good freindships... STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME. But if you are a souless crusty piece of dog shit and your friends are too then you will love this game."
5425,great game i love it
5426,"Among Us, or the alternative title: The Paddington 2 of video games.

Since Lang forced me recommended me Among Us, I tried it out and...

Among Us is the best video game I ever played. Spiritfarer, Mass Effect 2, Resistance 3, Driver SF, CoD World at War, BioShock Infinite, none of them are as good as Among Us.

The gameplay is so fluid, smooth, it's like olive oil on a pan. The animations are stellar like Pixar. The artstyle is better than almost all video games ever singlehandedly. The story of how the impostor is sus is better than the entirety of The Last of Us. The music made me cry. Amogus amogus amogus amogus amogus amogus.

10/10, definitive masterpiece, please play it or I'll be dead."

5443,stupid game..... need a account and its impossible to play with friends
5444,"the community of players is toxic, but if you're playing with friends its a great game."
5445,"Gameplay wise, I think Among Us is pretty alright. It's simple yet effective for a social deduction game, which works to its favour, but to me the task system is what makes this game stand out from most others. However, I personally prefer Garry's Mod's Trouble in Terrorist Town as I think it it provides a much more enjoyable and customizable experience - although this game is much better for those who want a more general fun time with a broader audience. Pus this game (at least on the main menu) is looking to be hitting some decent feature creep, which I get since it wasn't originally such a big game, but it does remove from the more streamlined experience I come for. 

However, [i]culturally[/i] what the actual hell. No one could've predicted a game that was already two years old at the time would've been picked up to become such a household name. As a former Minecraft kid, we stare down the barrel of what our generation was but [b]worse[/b]. I am honestly scared - no TERRIFIED for both what next game will take over the next generations, but also how much worse it will get... and I love it. As humanity refuses to learn its lessons, instead pushing itself further towards mass extinction and slavery everyday, we shall leave a legacy that will baffle historians and aliens alike. Future presidents, armed forces members, and scholars, maniacally laughing while singing the theme of this stupid game."

YOU BETTER GO FIX YOUR LIGHTS IN ELECTRICAL... OH WAIT! YOU REALIZE THAT WHEN LIGHTS ARE ON, YOU ARE IN A BIDDING AREA FOR MY GLOBAL INNARDS BIDDING CENTER. oh yeah and I am the imposter"
5464,"I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.
Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

5567,"litterly cant play for more than 10 seconds  before either the game servers go down, or the players make the game worse"
5568,very fun. worth the 5 dollars.
5569,"This game is a no-brainer for $5 but for $6 it would be too much. Thankfully, due to the low pricing of the game, I only had to sell my mothers wedding ring. This game has given me the opportunity to forget what it is like to live, laugh, and love. Each round brings satanic deformed dicked shaped beans murdering their once friends. Soon after paying people on Craiglist to get on a Discord call to play this game, strangers showed me their cocks. Totally my fault! :( IF you plan on playing this game, I encourage having friends. If you have friends that you enjoy lying and manipulating to or vice versa, this is a good game for you. This game strengthened my lying skills and now my mother has no clue who stole her ring! Emergency meeting, got em."
5570,"Concerned parent here. This game has tore my family apart. My son has committed 3 CRIMES after playing this game. Those 3 crimes have all been murder. He says that he needs to be ""sus"" and is the ""impostor"". My son KILLED my husband and told me that I can't ""report"" the body other wise the other crewmates will think he is ""sus"" and that he would be ""ejected"". This game has completely corrupted my son, he would of never done ANYTHING like this before playing this game. I am so dissapointed that this game is still on the store. It is making kids the ""impostor"" and they are literally committing crimes. Why is this still up?"

5632,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Among Us is an online and local party game from 2018.
The game is about teamwork and betrayal for 4-10 players. There are currently 3 different maps. The players have to compete a few simple tasks and there is an imposter (or more - maximum 3) who has to kill the other crew members and prevent them from completing the tasks.
If someone finds a corpse and reports it or by pressing a buzzer a crew meeting takes place where people are sharing their opinion who could be the imposter and they have to vote who will be thrown out. The communication is done by typing, there is no voice chat ingame. For the most fun it is recommended (but not necessary) to use some voice chat program like Discord or Teamspeak.
The match ends if all tasks are done, the imposters have been voted out or not enough crew members are left to vote the imposter out.
Among Us is a simple game, there are no complex gaming mechanics but it is so much fun! It is a good example that it is not all about high end graphics.
Initially Among Us was mostly unnoticed by gamers, the game had barely players in its first year but after some streamers started to play it and maybe because of Corona the playerbase exploded and it reached an all time player peak of 438524. This unexpected boom made the developers to cancel their plans to make Among Us 2 and keep updating the current game.
Among us is also available on Android and IOS and features crossplay but no cross-progression.
It is free on mobile (with advertising) but you should invest the 3,99 € and maybe buy some skin DLC's (or buy some skins on mobile) just to support the developers.

Also, if you aren't playing with friends it get's boring after a few hours, i'm not saying it's a bad game, i'm just saying the playerbase is dissapearing, and the only thing that will remain will be the memes, forever stuck in our heads...
As an achievement hunter, this was one of the most tedious games to do achievement hunting, it got to the point were i was like a zombie, playing at 12 am in total misery, just to get that 150 kills achievement... I recommend it if you have atleast 7 friends that are willing to play this game, if not, buy the game on sale, or download it on a phone

5670,Game is fun for a bit playing with people you actually know. Playing online with strangers (read children) is dumb. Makes you lose hope in humanity because no one uses logic and boot you from the game when you actually win as the Saboteur. Everyone still playing this game is a sensitive little snowflake and don't know how to navigate investigations. Also hardly anyone knows the new roles and what they can do.
5671,This game is fun with friends and strangers.

5824,"IM TIRED OF IT. no thats a joke i wouldnt leave a bad review for that. the game is ok but it feels rather bland to me. its too simple for my taste. all i see of it is killing and reporting and doing tasks. i cant help but feel it needs maybe something else but i know its complete, and no new mechanic will be made because it wouldnt fit anywhere. so overall, the game is good just not for me. if you like party games like jackbox party pack, this seems also like a party game so you would like it probably."
5825,Recent updates have made gameplay more confusing and it shows in public chats. I recommend entirely seperating standard game and advanced rules.

That was such an amazing time of paying video games with online and IRL friends and it really helped shape how I see video games now. Among Us gave us a platform to chat and bond with one another. It was really nice while it lasted :) Five stars, even despite the group not getting together anymore."

5863,"Game is OK, but the latest update messed the simplicity in being able to quickly jump on a game and play. There is some red-tape you have to get through (via a third party) where you need to add your CC number or Social Security to verify you are a parent. I appreciate the extra security, but I count on Steam or Apple to of dealt with security measures the moment I purchase the game. Besides, I'm not up to have another ""verifying"" company store my private info."
5864,Great game for party nights or days!

5866,"Kinda SUS.

100/10. If you wanted to be more successful, I would recommend a Among Us x Morbius Cross-Over. 

Overall great game."
5867,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
5868,great game to play with friends

5870,SAVE ME I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE I NEDD HELP ITS TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE
5871,it's okay
5872,"Among Us is a mixed bag of a game. I can't say I fully recommend it, but I can't say I hate it either. I've had a lot of fun with the game but like only under specific circumstances. 
My full review could be summed up like this. Among Us is a great game to play if you have friends, but if you don't have friends to play with I'm not sure if this is the game for you."
5873,"DING DING DING DING DING DING DING, DING DING DING"

5892,"This game has split the family apart. My older brother won't stop playing. He eats, sleeps, and plays Among Us. Whenever we watch a movie, all he wants to watch is movies about events in the game, or so he claims. He even got me to play it for 25 hours, which collectivly probably shortened my life span by ~10 years per hour. I don't know if I will live to see 18. My Father has left because he needs to work for around 16 hours a day, 7 days a week just to support the electric bill alone. He practically sleeps at the law firm. My mother is under constant stress, wondering if she will get to see her son out side of his room for a week."

5939,"Nice minimalistic and cartoonish animations. You'll find plenty of stupidity and annoyance among players especially in these kind of social games, but when you get use to it Boah is it addictive. Ez starter game for social deduction, you do get a hang of it fast. 
8/10 m8, it's allr8"
5940,"Among Us...

Among Us is a social deduction game developed by Innersloth. Among Us contains highly addictive elements of trying to 'find the imposter', or commit to doing your 'tasks', to survive. The main sections of roles you are set in at the beginning of the game includes the 'Imposter', and 'Crewmate', but with recent updates that are ongoing in combination with a passionate support by the developers have allowed more different roles. The stupefying maps available to choose from bring a variety to the game, unseen since Town of Salem. Every map shelters their own quality. Every map inspires players to showcase their divergent mindset. Every map is award-winning, and gives a chance for an interminable amount of entertainment.

This game is extremely addictive. The innovative gameplay consisting of running around and the endeavour to find the 'Sussy Imposter' (in-game slang), in combination with the award-winning maps and locations create a simplistic experience that, compared to haphazardly-thrown together games, shine above to a distinguished, pre-eminent, status. The environment of an extravagently positive player-base has created stereotypes for each character, that I find extremely amusing. 

The unmistakable thrill of putting together wires in the back of electrical while seeing red walk across in a cynical manner beats anything in the real world. The unquestionable sensation of 'stack-killing' in electrical and venting to Medbay provides the opportunity for the 'crème de la crème' of imposters to showcase their demiurge-like ability of being a 'true man'.

The nonpareil customization options is multitudinous. The ability to almost sculpt your multifarious character to anything within the capacity of the human brain is baffling.

I am concupiscent for the VR version to come out in October. For me to escape my sempiternal bullying I face at school to go into a new community of scanning Medbay.

This game is my life

Among Us is my life.

I love Among Us."

5967,"Pros:
• The game is a lot of fun to play with friends and strangers
• Every game is different, you won't get bored for a while
• Lots of cosmetics and colors to customize your character
• You can use your smarts in deduction in this game
• Nothing can beat the feeling of seeing ""Impostor"" on your screen

Cons:
• Servers and lobbies prone to crashing and breaking
• You'll be Crewmate 80% of the time
• Lots of people leave right after a game starts
• Old cosmetics and Cosmicubes most likely won't come back
• Very boring to play without an Internet connection

Suggestions:
• Improve some of the servers and game code to make the game more stable
• More roles to make Crewmate more interesting
• Punishment for leaving right after a game starts
• BRING BACK THE COSMICUBES!
• Better free-play, with customization settings"

6020,"In the 18 short minutes I have had the great pleasure of partaking in this game I have had the best time of my life. Before those 18 minutes my wife had just divorced me and taken my 3 kids who all have cancer away from me. They all had exactly 69 seconds to live, which happens to be the drive time to my ex wife's house that she had already bought with her ""personal trainer"". My children all died before I reached them so on the drive home I sobbed violently while blasting the playlist from joker (the movie) because I was having a #joker moment and about to tell my 4chan buddies about it when in the haze of crying and alpha male music I ran over my stupid 4th child I forgot about. Little bastard was playing in the street what a fucking idiot. I leave him alone for 2 minutes and the fucker gets himself run over, so then I had to go begrudgingly buy a headstone for him. He didn't have a name he couldn't even speak without saying ""googoo"" like a little bitch, grow up kid. He was 5, by that I mean months old but the rest of my sigma kids had been reading Shakespeare by that age. So anyways I go and get a headstone and just name him Disappointment and the guy looked at me with shock, probably because my superior chad genes got wasted on that little shit. On my way to the graveyard I see my ex wife and fucking brian the ""personal trainer"" god this dipshit probably doesn't have half the discord kittens that I do. They want to ""show their respect"" so I stand by and watch my ex get all handsy with the flowers she brought (she was stroking the stems as a move on me) so obviously I drop my pants to reciprocate the gesture of flirting but brian had to get in the way and punch me ?? my ex had the audacity to hold onto his arm for protection like a whore as if I did anything fucking slut cunt cumdump bitch. I start yelling at her about the obvious move on me and she said she was just ""putting the flowers into a bouquet"" and ""she only pushed them together once"" and that I'm a ""delusional piece of shit perv"" I wasn't entirely against this as my anime waifu calls many men pervs and she blushes while saying it so it must mean women like men they call pervs. I smirk at her in understanding in front of poor simple brian who has no idea he already lost her to me. I secretly gesture for her to call me and I leave. On my way home I decide to go to the gas station to pick up some certain rubber protection for me and my ex when I see some powerball tickets for sale. I decided to buy one and the number announcements were in 10 minutes! So I'm heading home with my magnum dong covers and powerball ticket and feeling great. I get home and while waiting for the powerball announcement I hear about amongus on my steam store page. I think psh that's for people at rock bottom and I'm great so I decide to check the time and wait for my powerball announcements. The numbers are announced and I didn't win. This was deeply upsetting to my good mood so I go back to the gas station and buy their entire stock costing me $5,000. This is okay because I will win and my ex is definitely coming over later. I wait for either to happen and neither do. I lost $5,000. I even owe $200. So in hopes of gaining money back I go to every nearby gasstation to buy all their powerball tickets in stock. I am now $60,000 in debt. I lose again. About to join the dead I remember my ex wife. I get myself looking all snazzy and trim my neckbeard and put on my nicest fedora. Driving to her house I see brians car parked outside, can't believe she's still with that fucker but it must be a cover. She's smart keeping him around so we can take his money and still be with me. I knock and am greeted by my ex wife in a robe, she's a really good actor she's even sleeping with the guy still. I respect the dedication and say ""Hello m'lady I have come to partake in the adult time x3"" (I say x3 outloud to show my excitement) she slaps me and I think wow she's good. It hurts a little though so I say ""owie cwan uuw gwive mwe a kwiss uwu"" she kicks me in the balls and throws me over her shoulder and then repeatedly hits me in the head with the coat hanger. I am starting to believe she is not acting fully. I ask ""w-what's wrong k-kitten?? you were supposed to be my hinata in a world full of sakuras T-T"" brian comes out without a shirt on in front of an alpha like me and I can't help but scoff and give a dazing smirk, ""what are you gonna do pretty b-"" I am immediately punched in the gut and stumble over and pant. This guy is as strong as naruto. I distract them by throwing my fedora out and then running out the door. On my way home I play juice wrld all girls are the same and run over a happy family I see passing by because they do not deserve to be happy when I am doomed to suffer eternally. The world can't handle me at my best so it has to hinder me yeah. That's all this is >:D . I am pulled over the police and before I can even explain my situation I am handcuffed and shoved to the ground. What betas these guys are but I love the police force and hope to suck someone I mean shake someone who's in the law enforcement's hand some day. As I'm blushing from being handcuffed by such a... strong... capable.. man yeah man he's a guy I'm blushing from anger what a dick. So I'm being dragged off by this... guy and in the car I try to explain and he tries to tell me I have the ""right"" to remain silent even when I try to speak. I am starting to get the feeling this guy does not want me to talk and this revelation brings a heavy feeling in my chest.. heart burn I suppose. At the police station apparently they do not take my villain arc as a valid reason for vehicular manslaughter so I am sentenced to life in prison twice. I get in and I uh accidentally dropped the soap whoops oh gosh hated that someone get me out of here! Then I find out about stores from the gentleman I uh met in the showers. What a tall I mean nice dude. So I make some cash doing some.. favors for people and I ask for a cheap laptop! Here I am, on steam, buying amongus. I am officially at my lowest so I figure it fitting. I was playing amongus and the immersion made me forget the troubles of the past couple days. My cellmate watched in awe as I was ""sus"" and not caught. I continue to kill 3 people and it makes me cry momentarily in reminder of my 3 children, yes only 3 it was. But then I imagine the rest are my ex and the personal trainer and disappointment. And let me tell you I should have killed them and not that stupid family. The jury says I killed disappointment but that airhead killed himself by stepping in front of my car. Anyways when being called sus by my crewmates I realized, I AM sus. I am sus and have not been caught. ME. Not my red sexy counterpart. I look over to my cellmate with wide eyes and caress his cheek. We kiss furiously and I realize I was the true imposter all along. Thank you amongus for helping me discover my true self."

6029,I love the overall game play of this game and being a investigator kind of to figure out the impostor.I just overall really like this game.The best part to me from the recent updates is now you can friend request people and join your friends games making it much easier to join your friends games.
6030,If you played this game in 2020 then it was was a fun game with friends and good gameplay. Now however with the UI changes and account making the game is just less playable and with a low player base so I would not recommend this game at this time.

6038,"Short, sweet, and full of fun. Just buy the game or you're sus.

But seriously though, this game is very fun and enjoyable, especially with large group of friends on both private and public servers. As simple as the concept of the game is, it was quite a successful game. I will make one or two slight critiques regarding gameplay and achievements, but is nothing too bad.

My first slight issue with the game is the rate at which I have gotten impostor in the game. Playing at least 16hrs on the game, you would expect I had gotten this role at least 20 times, but I would argues I have only gotten this role roughly 7 times. Unless I am playing the game wrong, I hope they could try rebalancing the rate at which a player will become an impostor. The second small grip I have is with the hidden achievements. I do get the incentive they hold, but maybe lower the threshold required for someone to obtain the more difficult ones. But it's nothing serious, so just stick to the grind!"

6050,"Hello, I am a 14 year old boy living in Nevada, and I have a crippling addiction to the game titled as ""Among Us"". I first began my journey into Among us on January, 2019. I instantly became addicted, I was playing Among Us 24/7 every day of the week for about 6 months, until my parents decided to intervene. They grounded me, and then they sent me to my grandma's house with limited technology throughout my summer break, as a way to ween me off of Among Us. During my summer break I was suffering from intense anxiety, and depression, suicide plagued my mind as I was begging god to let me play Among Us with him in heaven. Everywhere I went, I always saw Among Us, Lego pieces, fire alarms, trash bins, I couldn't get Among Us off of my mind. My grandma found me unconscious on the floor after a failed suicide attempt, she dialed emergency services and eventually the paramedics came to take me to the ER.

My parents decided to put me in therapy, I told my therapist everything, and I am still currently seeing a therapist. My doctor prescribed me Escitalopram and buspirone to treat my anxiety and depression. Everything was going fine and I felt my life was going to turn around, but then I relapsed. I hesitantly opened Among Us up after not playing for 2 months and went to town. I played for 2 weeks straight, with my stats on Among us peaking around 4000 hours. My parents found out and they took my computer away. I went through an intense psychotic episode for 1 entire week, I was convinced that I was an innocent crew member, about to be ejected for being sus, I did not trust anyone during that 1 week. After a second trip to the ER and several therapy appointments, here I am. I am completely lost in life, all of my friends have left me, my family is losing hope, and I am contemplating suicide due to the fact that I cannot play Among Us anymore."
6051,amonged us >_<
6052,I no longer trust my friends and am now hunting them down in the forest cause they called me a sussy baka

6056,"Find a group to play with, unless you happen to enjoy running a daycare."
6057,"I swear this is the best game I have ever played, while In the game I really felt like an impostor so I went around my neighborhood killing everyone. the police has not found out who the impostor was, so i told them that black was sus (they believed me and arrested him). after i told them that I went back to my house and continued to play this astonishing game, however i got dumb crewmate so i destroyed my monitor screaming at the top of my lungs (don't worry i replaced it later). I decided to give Among us another try and got impostor. I slaughtered all of them, and not just the men but the women and children. I did not stop, even if i tried i could not, it was like something came upon me. My family hates me because of this game but i had gained to much power. I kicked them out of their house and stole all of their financial investments. This game fixed my life, my friends hate me because I talk about Among us so much but deep down they don't know what opportunities this game has given me. When I was young I always had a dream, but it was destroyed by the people around me, they crushed all of my dreams. They all hated me I grew up, and I was stuck in the same cycle of this time ticking life that we all live in. I have been searching for ways that made me feel alive, like I belonged in this world they call Earth. I can still imagine all the people that put me down, and because of these incidents I have lost all of my friends that have turned their back away from me, I watch them grow up and I helped on their journey in life, but they threw it away right in my face and pushed me away. I found Among us because it seemed like a joke of a game. I joked around with this game to much and now everyone hates me. I just needed something so that maybe people would find something funny in me. but it just made me feel dumb that I was joking with this game. I feel that as I grow up I will hopefully find people that enjoy me and will not throw all of my dreams away. I will be going to college sooner or later so I should grow up and stop playing this game. I look back and remember all the good times I had with friends, and I look to know and realize that all of my friends where fake. All of my fake friends get girlfriends and push me aside to accommodate their girl. I wish things would go back to what they before I found of this game. but there is no way to time travel so all I can do is look forward in life and hope that things get better. This game is fun and enjoyable to play, it is better to play with friends. just be aware that once you play this game and see the characters you will see them everywhere you go."

6079,"I will never forget how impactful this game was in online culture, definitely one of the sussiest game ever made."
6080,"This game exploded with popularity during a time when we were all trapped at home with nowhere to go. And rightly so; it's fun. There's a reason it was so prolific for so long. It's an online version of a classic party game that people have experienced in their own way over the years.

Highly recommended, for the price and the replayability. It's fun even when the plague isn't rampant."

"
6193,"It may have originally come out in 2018, but Among Us took 2020 by storm, and it's deserving of that spotlight. Innersloth has made the tense, multiplayer fun of in-person cloak and dagger games like Mafia and Werewolf work on PC, mobile, and consoles with a flourish. And the great times I've had slaying, lying, and sleuthing my way through its charming sci-fi world got me wondering why it took so long for this sort of game to catch on. There are still a few technical hitches to be worked out, just like the fussy engines on the Skeld, but that hasn't kept me from coming back to it again and again in my down time.
The premise of Among Us is simple enough that just about anyone can pick it up quickly: eight crew members dash around a claustrophobic, cartoon spaceship to complete simple minigames and fill up a shared progress bar. But among them are two hidden impostors with the goal of secretly murdering everyone until they equal or outnumber the crew and claim victory. And yet, like so many excellent multiplayer games, it's very tricky to master because it’s about fooling real people, not gaming an AI. You can't even fall back on the same successful strategies too often or your opponents will catch on, so sometimes you have to mix things up and maybe even act illogically to keep them guessing.

The art is whimsical, with your bulbous, quirky astronauts stumbling around engine bays and reactor decks that look like the doodles I used to do in the margins of my notes in school. This is effective for a couple of reasons. For one, it keeps the mood pretty light, which is important in a game where you're going to be lying to, and being lied to, by your friends every single round. It's hard to take getting ganked in the middle of a task for the fifth time too personally when the animation for your demise makes you laugh after you're done yelling. The art style also makes interacting with the various machines and doodads on the map intuitive and enjoyable. I was able to drop right into my first match and get a decent grasp of what was going on without needing much help.
It's hard to take getting ganked in the middle of a task for the fifth time too personally when the animation for your demise makes you laugh.
The tasks the crew will be rushing to complete present a good variety of tiny minigames, from finishing a simple maze to connecting colored wires. Most of them will test memory or hand-eye coordination in a way that requires you to keep your cool, which can be a challenge when you know there are murderers running around, out for your blood. The fact that most of the minigames cover up a significant portion of your screen is a really effective way to build tension, too. Even tasks like Download, which just makes you sit and watch a progress bar fill up, have me going, ""Come on… come onnn!"" Any movement at the edges of my monitor could mean impending death, and you know skilled impostors will use these blind spots to their advantage.

Playing as the impostor is definitely the most fun for me, and it requires a variety of skills to do well. Isolating your target so no one witnesses the crime is the easiest way to get away with it, but if you do get caught by only one other person, being able to pin the kill on them by lying over in-game text chat or an external voice app like Discord can save you from being cast out. Impostors can also use the well-placed vents on each map to flee the scene, but you have to be careful not to be spotted in two disconnected rooms in a way that makes it clear you took a shortcut. But I enjoy being on the other side as well: As a crewmate, it's a thrilling detective game to try and keep track of where everyone is, who they were with, and poke holes in their alibis at each meeting in a way that will convince the other players to vote them off the ship.

Much like in poker, you're playing the other players more than anything.
It's delightfully satisfying to lead either the impostor or the crew team to victory, because much like in poker, you're playing the other players more than anything. If you group up with the same people often enough, you can pick up on their tells. Some of my friends will stay dead silent if they're impostors, while others will start yelling and trying to direct the blame on anyone else the second the first body is found. There's a lot of mental juggling that goes into sussing out a killer, because you have to remember when and where you saw everyone and, ideally, ask the right questions to catch them in a lie without making it too obvious that's what you're doing. Then, you need to make a compelling case. Because even if you know who the impostor is 100 percent, that won't matter if you can't convince the other voters.

Some of my favorite impostor rounds have been those in which I coasted to victory in a public game by changing my handle to something unassuming, like ""joey07"", and acting like I'm a young kid who doesn't really understand the rules that well. Aside from how I type and what I do or do not choose to comment on, I can even make a big show of having a hard time getting around the ship or not understanding how crew tasks work. Knowing how to perform innocence, even to the point that you half believe you're innocent yourself, is a great skill to have. But it's a common enough strategy that if you overdo it, at this point, experienced players will catch on. So sometimes I have two cover identities: one that's way too obvious, and another that I want my opponents to figure out and think that's the final layer. But it's not. The mind games can get really deep, and they're my favorite part of Among Us.
Some of my favorite imposter rounds have come from acting like I'm a young kid who doesn't understand the rules.
It works so well in part because the default map, a spaceship called The Skeld, is very well balanced. There’s a clever, circular layout, a mix of bottlenecks and open spaces, and just enough room for impostors to maneuver unseen if you’re not watching for them at the right moment. The other two maps, Mira HQ and Polus, are a bit too fragmented and spread out, which can give the impostors a big advantage. That hasn’t been too big a problem for me, though, because the wide variety of game options allow you to tweak things in the crew or impostors' favor with toggles like anonymous voting and confirming someone's role when they're ejected. This also offers flexible difficulty when playing with a group of more or less experienced killers.

There are some technical issues, still. Finding a match can be frustrating, since the clunky, dated browser only shows you a limited number of lobbies at a time. It can be tricky to find games that aren’t already full or are a long way from getting there. And the fact that there's no mechanic to punish players who rage-quit when they don't get to play as impostor, or are caught dead to rights in the middle of a murder; those can lead entire rounds to premature, unsatisfying endings. Adding a quick match button and some way to disincentivize quitters, like a time out before you can join another match if you quit too often, would both go a long way – not to mention built-in voice chat support."

6233,"I can't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ believe this. Pink from 'Among Us' ruined my marriage.

A couple months ago, my wife said she was going out for a ladies' night. She asked me to take care of my son, so I immediately obliged. ""Yes Ma'am,"" I told her. After a while of waiting, she finally left and I could play my favourite game, Among Us. I hopped on my laptop, booted it up and my desktop loaded, complete with the 'Red Sus' background and all my Among Us Impostor fan-art. I was shaking in excitement. I slowly dragged my finger across the track pad, and watched the cursor as it glided over to the Among Us icon. Among Us. My absolute favourite game of all time and quite possibly the best and most well-made game in the entire world. As I clicked the button my body twitched with joy at the thought of being the impostor again. My fingers drummed impatiently on my desk as the Innersloth logo faded in, and then out. Then the main title appeared. I immediately looked at pink as she slowly floated across the screen. Oh, how I wish I could feel those luscious, soft asscheeks. Pink is my queen. The real woman in my life. My wife could never be as sexy as Pink is; her soft footfalls in electrical as I peek at her curvy form from inside a vent, waiting for the right time to strike. I could never get close to Pink, however, as if she had some kind of sixth sense, she would always leave before I could reveal myself to her as the impostor. I press Practice, to warm up my fingers before my first intense game of Among Us. I hit Blue in Comms, then cross the hall and vent to Specimen, murdering Green in cold blood. The thrill of killing an animated character in an online game has never been such a rush. I then move towards Reactor, stabbing Yellow in the back and then running down the corridor to the right to access Decontamination. I move quietly through the halls, like a snake about to strike its prey, and I see- Oh no. It's Pink. Standing there motionlessly as I face her directly. Her visor shows no emotion. But she knows. I can feel it in the air. I can't kill her. She is too beautiful, too angelic, the light reflecting off of her pink bodysuit, like stars on a voided sky. She doesn't run. I am moved to tears as I caress the screen, kissing it tenderly. ""Goodbye, Pink. See you soon. It will all be okay,"" I whisper in a soft, reassuring voice. Then as my cursor hovers over the kill button, I hesitate. Thoughts of love go through my head. Red having reddish-pink sus children with Pink. But I have to. As the impostor, it is my duty to kill. I press the 'Kill' button and watch as my character beheads Pink silently. All I hear is the spurt of blood. There is no rush. There is only Red, standing by himself in Fuel. Pink's lifeless body laying on the floor beside him. I feel nothing at first, then immense sadness, like I'm at a loved one's funeral. My son knocks on the door, interrupting my brief moment of mourning. He asks, ""Dad? Are you going to make me a snack?"" I tell him to shut up, and my voice cracks. I break down sobbing. I killed her. I killed my one true love. God, forgive me. I open the door to my son, and he has a confused look on his face. I say nothing, and walk to the kitchen to make him a sandwich. Tears roll off my face into the bread as I lay it onto the counter. Lettuce, cheese and meat, followed by a sad swirl of mustard on top. My son is quiet. He sits on the couch, and stares at the floor. There is a depressing air around us. I serve him the sandwich and walk back to my room, contemplating life. If I killed Pink, how am I to be trusted around my family? I cry for hours, and finally my wife comes back. She sees me bawling on the bed like a child who dropped his ice cream. She then asks me why I'm crying and mutter, ""I killed her. I killed my only love, Pink, in Among Us."" She is filled with rage and slaps me across my face. I feel numb. She asks for a divorce. I don't reply. Instead, I take my laptop and get into my car, driving to a nearby hotel. Fast forward a few months to the divorce. It was quick and painless. After court, I ask my former wife to take me back.


""I can't take you back. You've always been this way. I was sus of you from the start.""

6257,"Vintage chocolate chip cookies

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking"

6302,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

6351,its good.
6352,"In the first Spongebob movie, Spongebob mentions that he has won employee of the month 374 consecutive times. That's 31 years and 2 months without any gaps. There is another episode where Spongebob and Squidward compete for an employee of the month award, and Spongebob mentions that he's won the award 26 times in a row, adding on another 2 years and 2 months. The episode ends with neither of them winning it, ending Spongebob's 2 year streak. Let's assume that he started another streak immediately after this and never stopped. Spongebob has to be at the very least 18 when he started working at the Krusty Krab, since he legally owns a house when he gets the job in the first episode. With that said, let's do some math.

18 Years + 2 Years + 31 Years = 51 Years

This makes Spongebob 51 years old during the events of the first Spongebob movie. So when Mr. Krabs calls him a kid, keep in mind that Spongebob is an old man who has been working the same minimum wage job non-stop for at least 33 years straight."

I feel bad for Fall Guys tho - because the moment they became trending, this game took the spotlite. I blame it on the similar character design and lack of hands.

6429,"Among us is a game that is very personal to me, about 1 and a half years ago through the depths of covid lock down I was all alone, no friends, no where to go. Among us changed that. It opened up a whole new window of adventure and fun, it allowed me to connect with a multitude of people. Among us brought great memories and tons of happiness to my life. Without among us I wouldn't be who I am today. Among us fosters good qualities too all the people who are blessed enough to play it."

6438,I don t like friends
6439,"Amogus

What can I say. A perfect game to play with your friends. A lot of great features and the updates makes the game even better, so you don't need to install any mods. Still hoping for a proximity chat, or maybe a game mode with one. Some memes are annoying, but this is a very good game.

8/10 (try it out with your friends)"
6440,everyone leaves when they are not imposter
6441,good if u actually have friends
6442,"“This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you”"

6455,It's fun to play with friends.
6456,I Lost 2 friend after playing this game. Very good game. I hate him anyways.
6457,Not Ideal.
6458,"It is definitely a game that constantly improves itself and is so sweet. It actually sounds like a lot of fun, but if you're playing with your friends, it can also be very frustrating. Play if you want to experience two same feelings at the same time. But if you don't want to get in trouble with your friends, I say don't play. It's a game of being a total killer. If you want to play a lot at the same time, I think it will at least be less frustrating if you go into unfamiliar lobbies by yourself. I don't think you would care much if someone you don't know blames you. Hanging out in different lobbies can be mentally healthier. I would like to recommend it very much, but I cannot recommend it because it is a friend-breaking game. If you want to keep your friendships, I highly recommend the Hide and Seek mode. That mod is really fun, I think."
6459,I feel like I don't really trust my friends but I need someone to vent to.

6464,"(+) :
- cross-play compatible, makes everyone easier to play this game together
- funi mini games
- pretty lightweight for a 2020 standard game

(-) :
- servers can be unresponsive sometimes
- $2.99 is still somewhat expensive for mini games like these

6472,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

6543,"Filled with little ones, this game can be fun to play with friends but it is really hard to even remain calm when your gaming experience is with players who constantly say ""not me"".  It is also among the top favourite games of my 9-years-old cousin and of course the first place is for minecraft. I don't even need to mention roblox and fortnite as having an honourable rank in her list. Take this listing of my little cousin into consideration and be prepared for the community waiting for you there!"

6555,its very fun
6556,"Mafia/Werewolf is a video game released in 2018 that took the internet by storm, due primarily to the fact that the word ""Amogus"" is objectively fun to say.

In Town of Salem, you play as one of several armless blobs in space suits. Your job is usually to perform a series of mindless mini-games in order to fix and maintain your spaceship. One of your crewmates, however, is not actually a crewmate, but is, in fact, a bad'n. This bad'n wants to eat your face, which it can do pretty easily because you're busy playing mini-games. At any time, people can try and call a vote to get one person thrown ou-and you don't really care. Let's be honest. You already know how Trouble in Terrorist Town is played. Odds are good you're only reading this far because you're curious how somebody could write a review that's more characters than what is required to write ""A M O G U S"" in ascii art or something.

The problem with most ""social deduction"" games (of which Space Station 13 is definitely one) is that the primary appeal of them is lost in the sort of bite-sized, hyper competitive arena of online play. These sorts of games were originally designed to be things you did with all your friends in the same room. The appeal didn't just come from lying, it came from lying directly to people you knew, who you'd see in the office the next day, or who would then have to reconsider their romantic relationship with you in light of your natural talent for lying. These sorts of things are not as pronounced in online play. Most games of Deceit boil down to one of three playstyles: people who hammer on the meta of the game's rules in a blind effort to win, people who screw around on purpose for the funny Amogus memes, and the regular players who get ground between the two as they try to figure out what playing the game well even means.

I don't need to play more than a few rounds of Spyfall to understand it. I understood this game the first ten times I played a game that runs on the exact same premise. While this game's art is charming (in that it's nostalgic for the Newgrounds era of online content), and the few things they add to enhance the gameplay loop do, in fact, exist, the massive popularity of the title is down to nothing more than memes and everyone knows it. 

Overall, a game that is good for what it is, and little else. I give Secret Hitler a ""microwaveable impasta"" out of 10."

6568,"I can't fucking believe this. Pink from 'Among Us' ruined my marriage.

A couple months ago, my wife said she was going out for a ladies' night. She asked me to take care of my son, so I immediately obliged. ""Yes Ma'am,"" I told her. After a while of waiting, she finally left and I could play my favourite game, Among Us. I hopped on my laptop, booted it up and my desktop loaded, complete with the 'Red Sus' background and all my Among Us Impostor fan-art. I was shaking in excitement. I slowly dragged my finger across the track pad, and watched the cursor as it glided over to the Among Us icon. Among Us. My absolute favourite game of all time and quite possibly the best and most well-made game in the entire world. As I clicked the button my body twitched with joy at the thought of being the impostor again. My fingers drummed impatiently on my desk as the Innersloth logo faded in, and then out. Then the main title appeared. I immediately looked at pink as she slowly floated across the screen. Oh, how I wish I could feel those luscious, soft asscheeks. Pink is my queen. The real woman in my life. My wife could never be as sexy as Pink is; her soft footfalls in electrical as I peek at her curvy form from inside a vent, waiting for the right time to strike. I could never get close to Pink, however, as if she had some kind of sixth sense, she would always leave before I could reveal myself to her as the impostor. I press Practice, to warm up my fingers before my first intense game of Among Us. I hit Blue in Comms, then cross the hall and vent to Specimen, murdering Green in cold blood. The thrill of killing an animated character in an online game has never been such a rush. I then move towards Reactor, stabbing Yellow in the back and then running down the corridor to the right to access Decontamination. I move quietly through the halls, like a snake about to strike its prey, and I see- Oh no. It's Pink. Standing there motionlessly as I face her directly. Her visor shows no emotion. But she knows. I can feel it in the air. I can't kill her. She is too beautiful, too angelic, the light reflecting off of her pink bodysuit, like stars on a voided sky. She doesn't run. I am moved to tears as I caress the screen, kissing it tenderly. ""Goodbye, Pink. See you soon. It will all be okay,"" I whisper in a soft, reassuring voice. Then as my cursor hovers over the kill button, I hesitate. Thoughts of love go through my head. Red having reddish-pink sus children with Pink. But I have to. As the impostor, it is my duty to kill. I press the 'Kill' button and watch as my character beheads Pink silently. All I hear is the spurt of blood. There is no rush. There is only Red, standing by himself in Fuel. Pink's lifeless body laying on the floor beside him. I feel nothing at first, then immense sadness, like I'm at a loved one's funeral. My son knocks on the door, interrupting my brief moment of mourning. He asks, ""Dad? Are you going to make me a snack?"" I tell him to shut up, and my voice cracks. I break down sobbing. I killed her. I killed my one true love. God, forgive me. I open the door to my son, and he has a confused look on his face. I say nothing, and walk to the kitchen to make him a sandwich. Tears roll off my face into the bread as I lay it onto the counter. Lettuce, cheese and meat, followed by a sad swirl of mustard on top. My son is quiet. He sits on the couch, and stares at the floor. There is a depressing air around us. I serve him the sandwich and walk back to my room, contemplating life. If I killed Pink, how am I to be trusted around my family? I cry for hours, and finally my wife comes back. She sees me bawling on the bed like a child who dropped his ice cream. She then asks me why I'm crying and mutter, ""I killed her. I killed my only love, Pink, in Among Us."" She is filled with rage and slaps me across my face. I feel numb. She asks for a divorce. I don't reply. Instead, I take my laptop and get into my car, driving to a nearby hotel. Fast forward a few months to the divorce. It was quick and painless. After court, I ask my former wife to take me back.

""I can't take you back. You've always been this way. I was sus of you from the start."""

6571,"So I (19M) was sitting in the Living room watching Morbius. My parents(senior citizens) visited to come check on me. They caught me watching Morbius and they got very upset because I have been through phases like this before. I convinced my mother (55F) that Morbius is great, but my father (56M) disagreed. So I yelled ITS MORBIN TIME and may have beat the living shit out my father. My mother(idiotic) then said YOU DID THIS LAST TIME DURING YOUR NFT PHASE so then I plunged her to the depths of Tartarus. My sister (19F) and her friend (18F) saw me and then tried to run so I yelled OH NO YOU MORB'T and morbed so much they died. I at this point, had almost become God. I had blown up my house and set on fire to get rid of the evidence. At this point I, (20M) have been running from the CIA, the FBI, the police, the Secret Service, Interpol, the UN security unit, Disney S&P, and Google Maps. I have almost reached the final phase of morb. Soon my original being will die off and I will morb in the final morb. I morbing regret morbing Morbius. Oh morb. Im gonna morbing morb myself. Morb this. Morb it all.
TL;DR I killed my dad over a movie and ended up internationally wanted."

6580,"I honestly love to play this game randomly, I don't think this is a game that you can get much out of except maybe playing with your friends randomly when you guys have nothing to do. It is also much better to play with your friends than random people. Unlike games like UNO and such, this game would be much better with voice option because through text... it isn't that interesting. Hearing your friends trying to lie or such makes it much more fun. I would say play this game if you just want to waste a little time. I played this on mobile and steam and I have found both to be a little buggy."

6582,Honestly people say this is a bad game but it really isn't! People hate among us because of its memes and I don't think thats fair because who said the memes were created my the creators am I right. Well this game Is amazing A simple Murdery mystery 2 game in space who would've though? Honestly great Idea. It is really fun to play with family and friends so you should check it out sometime

6609,"Concerned parent here. This game has tore my family apart. My son has committed 3 CRIMES after playing this game. Those 3 crimes have all been murder. He says that he needs to be ""sus"" and is the ""impostor"". My son KILLED my husband and told me that I can't ""report"" the body other wise the other crewmates will think he is ""sus"" and that he would be ""ejected"". This game has completely corrupted my son, he would of never done ANYTHING like this before playing this game. I am so dissapointed that this game is still on the store. It is making kids the ""impostor"" and they are literally committing crimes. Why is this still up?"

6614,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

6629,"This game was really and truly enjoyable and fun at its peak in 2018 - 2019. It began to go downhill after the airship update and its account system. The currency and skin earning system put the nail in the coffin for this once wonderful game. I do not recommend this in its current state, but if Innersloth can make this a good game again, I will reinstall it. Until then, pretty ass game."

6679,"This game left its imprint on the social deduction genre and was discovered at the right time during the pandemic. However, in 2022, the multiplayer leaves a lot to be desired. You *must* be in a voice call with nine others, which makes playing this with friends difficult. Hard to get that many people online at the same time. Playing crewmate gets boring and people check out after two or three times playing this. Playing with randos is not the same experience."

6703,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
6704,"This game, is not a game; It's a daycare or (With friends/ if you have any) is still a daycare but with people that you like, and had trust in if they lie well. I would recommend this if your buddies are able to play more then once, other then that you basically pay to watch kids create chaos."

NB: use a voice chat while playing(more fun)"

6790,too funny for my tastes
6791,"the game really makes you think on what your friends would say, along with what they think you will say, it is a challenge to either work as a team, or to sneak behind everyone's back. 8/10"

6803,do i have to explain
6804,This game will cause you to fall out with your friends and never trust anyone again. Don't do it.
6805,Truly the most iconic game of all time. No game has or ever will change the world like Among Us did.
6806,It gud
6807,"Was a great game. Until they added there account system. I made an account, which is a pain in the butt, beacause I apperently made a mistake in this process I lost my BOUGHT dlc. After makeing a few accounts I get a prompt to make an account every time I open the game. This is worse than a classic EA-Move. This account system is just a way to get some more cash out of this game."
6808,Best played with a large group of friends on a voice call. Online playing isn't quite as fun.

6883,"I do recommend this game only if you can play with a voice chat on discord, otherwise the game wont be much of a ""mind game"" and more of a who said ""*blanck* is sus"" first. There are some rare cases where you get into a public game and most people actually try to use their brain, but 9 times out of 10, you are just 100 times better off playing voice chat, thats where the real fun of the game is."
6884,sus?
6885,its fun
6886,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

When my dad died i had nothing to live for anymore but then this little sussy game came into my life and has helped me learned how to progress from the pain that has held me for so long. I truly hope that this game can offer everyone the same knowledge i have learned from such a angelic masterpiece."

I sometimes dream about being the imposter at school very SUS indeed but oh well. This masterpiece of a game is so addicting that I can play it all day long all night 24/7 infact ever since I downloaded amogus I have lost 18kgs and have even adapted to be able to pee in a bottle under my desk so I never have to get up ever again. 
Boy do i love among us its very SUS indeeed!!"

6991,"If you are looking to play a fun social deduction game I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place. The game itself is fine, and when it was released originally I would have recommended it but being very focused on multiplayer means that a large portion of the quality of the game relies on the community surrounding it which I cannot vouch for.

If you want to play a more interesting social deduction game consider the board game secret hitler (or play it for free on [url=secrethitler.io]secrethitler.io[/url]) which unlike among us gives you more information to actually be able to rely on social deduction instead of word-of-mouth.

A recent update made the game ""kid friendly"" which I think ruins the game even more, they ask for your age which is just illegal due to COPPA and saying that you are anything under 12 will limit your ability to chat with people so much you might as well just quit. You will only be able to read and write some simple pre-made text which does not allow for much discussion of events (the main point of this genre.)"

6997,This game has made me clinically insane please help me for the love of god.
6998,"""Sure is taking a while to sign in"" The issue that has been destroying my trust in this game, and the developers. I go to this game when I'm in the mood, and I have felt like playing recently. However, that issue is preventing me from doing so. Along with the fact guest accounts are no longer supported, therefore I could have only played on my phone. But since I spent 5 dollars just to play the game to end up not being able to play it, I feel that it would be accepting defeat. Many others have had my same issue, and most have been able to fix it. Not me. I have tried every method, and have used every source, but to no avail. Something tells me the availability to purchase the game on the Epic Games store has something to do with this, and this problem has only been really prominent since then. I doubt nobody will pay attention to this, but with the tiny bit of hope left, I write this review. It is perhaps the only way to grab significant attention to this issue, and it seems I am the only person who has had this issue recently. If you read through all of this, please try to give this more attention, or give your advice. Good Day."

7011,"First and foremost, let me say this: ""there are multiplayer games that benefit well from cross-play and better communication (voice)"". I played this game early in the months it got trending in 2020 and now I gave it another try only to feel disappointed. Here's the pain points of this game from my point of view so far:

1. Accounts
Why ? this game would benefit from cross play but due to the absence of voice comms, it makes the player base inconsistent and inconclusive. Many mobile players disconnects from time to time leaving the wired gamers (Console, PC) alone with unfinished tasks. What's the real foundation of needing to have ""account"" to play this game in the first place if limiting chat to a set of selection would've been better as many players seem to text gibberish stuff anyway (moderation ?). What's your real target userbase seriously ?

2. Levels
So the game implies to make people grind now ? Oh no my crewmate is only lv. 1, they must be bad and new at this game. Like no shussy  I would ever care about levels. It adds nothing to this game as you could achieve the so called ""benefits"" of levels in a different way without levels.

3. Voice Chat
Oh my, how long it took them to realise the point of integrating a game of their own to any communication platform to deliver a much more intense experience ever ? I'd love to have a voice chat specific game mode than waiting for VRs or anything else to be implemented.

4. Player Education
How often that is a specific player is just happened to wander around not doing any tasks and once a meeting is held they would be so clueless to just echo what other players are saying in the chat  ? My goodness they don't even text for most of the times to understand the situation they're in. I hope that I'm the only person mistaken on this 4th take because I do not live in a country where english is the primary language of preference, but again we could've solve these issue regardless. Don't even get me started to complain on people that would just randomly held meetings at minute 1 to point fingers to win the game, that's just a gameplay design flaw if anything.

5. Community Run Game Server
For the love of god, if you guys have been unable to make use of ""accounts"" as a mean to moderate the kids, then let us to maintain a sustainable list of community moderated servers so that people can have certain level of positive expectation in their lobbies apart from the other benefit such as latency. 

Game is enjoyable, but the quirks are just upsetting at best and I'm not sure how you guys (the dev) would maintain this game forward. It's so insane how many of these problems could coexists at once to manifest for the worse. I hope that there will be a much less unfriendly decision made (introduction of accounts) in the future to make this game great again. 

I still believe in the devs ability to turn some stuff around and it shall be."

7015,"Great game, Bad reputation + community

I really thought it was creative to have it be a game where cartoon character astronauts are in a murder mystery while traveling through space. After all, I do like sci-fi spacey-related stuff. The gameplay was great, the GUI was user-friendly, and the whole idea was pretty creative. But really the only issue was its community. Not long after if became popular in the gaming community, the term ""sus"", a short term for saying that someone of suspicious of being the imposter (which they were using wrong) spawned countless memes into it's community. And ill be honest, that was funny for a little while, but it became to be really annoying and repetitive in memes and jokes, and this whole ""sussy baka vent"" and how it was in so much weird bulls**t  overall ruined my humor as well with the pictures of real-life objects resembling among us characters was if nothing but annoying.

So in total, the game was good and all, but the memes, community, really f**ked my overall opinion of it."

7034,"At the time of first playing it it was popular, after the ""Downfall"" of fall guys and the ""Uprising"" of Among us. This game is like a murder mystery game but on space. You the player and other players (15 max) are able to play in one lobby to find out who did the murder of a player. You can either play as a ""Crewmate"" of an ""Imposter"" but it kinda gets chosen for you like luck. The ""Crewmate"" can do tasks and call emergency meetings, the ""Imposter"" can Vent, kill and has to fake tasks to be able hide that they are the ""Imposter"" in this game. They can vote out ""Crewmate(s)"" or ""Imposter(s)"" if they vote a ""Crewmate(s)"" they get a screen ejecting the ""Crewmate(s)"" into space, if you are able to vote out the ""Imposter(s)"" you will be able to win the game. 



                                  The Mobile version
At first this game was kinda like ""What am I doing?"" but after a little bit I knew how to play, this game is a game my friend recommended to me, I decided to after seeing many videos on a platform called ""YouTube"" I decided to download it. I decided to customize my person so I went into a game of ""Among Us"" Instantly I knew what to do. I went to the computer and decided to look through the hats. Many of them were locked for in-app purchases. My friend pointed to one and said ""that one is the most expensive"" although it is not that expensive at all I trusted him. So after a while I decided to go ahead and buy all of the in-app purchases and they did not let me down, they were great! So I played on that more often.



                                  The Devs
The Devs are the same devs who created a kinda popular game such as ""Henry Stickmin""  A good game that I have 100% on another account but this game is just as good, there is online play, a huge feature in a game.

7066,"this game is like Adam Sandler. he was once funny then he became a joke, except the joke was not funny."
7067,"Late review:
The game WAS worth it back in 2020. But now is not.

Multiplayer: A lot of servers are stuck on ""Only quick chat"" and that makes communicating a hell.
It also doesn't help that you need a id to use free chat (or a credit card)
But at least there is a community playing the game.

Main game:
I may have played almost 100 hours but the game gets boring after around 75-80 hours.
The new roles don't really help. And new features don't help

Personalizing/Micro transactions:
The game went form you having the all library of items. Now ya gotta get them back.
But at least they are adding new items.
At the start, pets were the only thing that you can buy with bread (cash :)  ) Now there is packs, coins and everything else.

Is it worth it?
The ""among us"" craze may be over but this is a solid game.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

7112,"Zé - féle hamburger buci

Hozzávalók: (8 nagyobb vagy 10 közepes méretű bucihoz)

40g élesztő
750g liszt
70g kristálycukor
1db egész tojás
50g margarin
450g natúr joghurt
egy teáskanálnyi só

1db egész tojás a kenéshez
egy kevés szezámmag a tetejére

Elkészítés:
Először az élesztőt futtatom fel egy kevés langyos tejben, amihez egy teáskanálnyi kristálycukrot is teszek és hagyom magában dolgozni. A lisztet átszitálom, hozzáöntöm a felfutott élesztőt, kissé eldolgozom benne, majd hozzáadom a kristálycukrot, a tojást, a puha margarint, a natúr joghurtot és legvégül a sót. Az egészet jó alaposan összegyúrom és addig dagasztom, amíg a cipó szép sima felszínű, rugalmas nem lesz és el nem válik a tál falától. Ekkor egy kevés lisztet szórok a tálba, visszarakom a cipót és konyharuhával letakarva, majd pléddel gondosan bebugyolálva egy órára félrerakom meleg helyre kelni.
A kelesztés után lisztezett munkalapra borítom a tésztát, kicsit átgyúrom, majd 8-10 egyenlő részre osztom. Minden egyes kis tésztadarabból bucit formázok, úgy hogy a teteje szép sima, legyen, az alján pedig ""elcsipkedem"" az egyenetlenségeket. A megformázott zsömléket konyharuhával letakarva még 15percig hagyom pihenni és kelni. Ez idő alatt a tepsit kibélelem sütőpapírral, majd a bucikat egyesével átpakolgatom rá, úgy, hogy legyen köztük hely bőven. Ezután 2x kenem át a felszínüket felvert, egész tojással, majd alaposan megszórom a tetejüket a szezámmaggal.
180fokra előmelegített, légkeveréses sütőben kb. 20-25 perc alatt szép aranybarnára sülnek.

7116,cool
7117,game is evil. destroys friendships. causes chaos.
7118,"The Game itself is Awesome, but too many dumb people everywhere. Every server I join they keep blaming and kicking the one guy who's correct about who's the real Imposter. I was blame and Kick for defending a innocent guy and so I left the server trying to join a New one but ended up in another server full of idiots. This game is literally showing us how Dumb people are. I try to join a new server but ended up with a time out which piss me off, So I quit playing the game cause there's no smart people out there to play with in random servers. I'm just playing this with friends now.

If you notice that a Server is full of dumb people.. just leave and join a new one."
7119,good to just play with friends bad because of pedos
7120,I like It
7121,not enough sex :/
7122,"It's a game where you as play as 2 different sides, crewmates and impostors. As the crewmates you run around and try not getting num num'ed by the sussy impostors. As the impostors you take a fat bite outta the crewmates since they're basically a walking drumstick snack. There are also roles like engineer gaming and medic gaming for the crewmates, for the impostors there is spy gaming. cum."
7123,YES
7124,if u don't buy the game ur sus. aHHAHhahahahaha
7125," 4.7 out of 5 stars. Simple, yet engaging murder mystery type of game. The new maps as well as player roles make the game more enjoyable, with the exception of the crappy account system. However due to the nature of the state of this game, I do not recommend to play this game, for anyone out there."

7141,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

7209,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

Would totally recommend to anyone for all ages just make sure you've got an account as it is easier with the game play features, if the account feature isn't working on your devise contact the among us team to help! They are so nice and are always there. Also another way to show your support for the game is to  report bug fixes as other than them playing i don't think they have a way of finding out about them. 5 STARS Would totally recommend!

7254,"This game saved my life.

I am 37.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

7296,"Among Us is an interesting social deduction game, with features such as being able to move around a map, perform tasks, and, as an impostor, making disruptions on the map (sabotage). These are distinct features compared to other social deduction games (e.g. Town of Salem), as those are usually solely text based, with no movement at all, and having the goals be solely to find the bad guy (or as the bad guy, kill all the others). This also keeps those who have died, since it gives them something to do.

Despite the gameplay and mechanics of the game making it very interesting, it lacks severely from what drives a social deduction game. The players. A platoon of idiots occupy this game's playerbase, and you will see them at every turn. Not just in bad plays, but also in total inconsideration, such as making public lobbies and then banning you right away; a waste of time, and incredibly common with no recourse and preventative measure. You'll occasionally get the reprobates that communicate outside the game with friends, but luckily it doesn't seem to be common and is reportable. There are also those who leave upon the start of the game. The reasons are unknown, but most likely it's from not getting their preferred role (impostor or crewmate), and there is no penalty for these inconsiderate baboons.

Gamebreaking bugs are not uncommon as well, such as impostors walking backwards, and game's just being broken from freezing in place or not being able to report or call emergency. There's also lag issues where visuals fall behind on what's actually happening, and this results in people going through doors, or killing from extremely long ranges.

A gameplay issue I have are the visual tasks and taskbar updates. There’s a metagame around these 2 things where you can tell if someone is a real crewmate by observing these, and that is an incredibly disadvantage against impostors. Hosts have the option of turning them off, but I don’t see a good reason for even having the option of having them on, since they help crewmates immensely more than it should.

I find myself playing for too long looking for ""satisfying"" good games, but I only get myself into more disappointing games. The short bursts every round makes the game addicting (at least for me), and I found myself playing an unhealthy length of time just to squeeze out any bit of satisfaction from a game, and it was never enough. I would only stop when an absurd amount of time passed.

The game is severely lacking within the public sphere of gameplay, and only really excels within the role as a party game among friends. Even then, you require quite a decent number of people to set up a game (I'd say about 10), and I don't think it's going to be easy arranging such a thing for most people. If they’ve never played either, then the details of the game (like the locations in each of the maps) won’t be readily known. For the trouble you run into outside of private games, I don't recommend this game."

I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

7437,"Day 1: Saturday

Dear, diary
Today my mom bought me a new game called among us it seems really exciting, and the best part is my dad plays it too! I can't wait to bond with my dad over among us! Goodnight diary.

Day 3: Monday

Dear, diary
My dad said he was going to get milk after I won a game of among us, but it's been 2 days now.. I hope he isn't hurt. My mom has been extremely quiet and distant as well. I hope tomorrow is better. Goodnight diary.

P.S Mondays SUCK

Day 7: Friday

Dear, diary
Everyone at school bullies me for liking Sarah at school. They say I'm nothing compared to her and I'm way outta her league. In the locker room today.. One of the bullies put a bra in my backpack, and the other dumped my bag. It was so horrible.. They called me sussy wussy and said I was a sus creep. I miss my dad diary. At least mom is here..

Day 13: Saturday

Dear, diary
I'm in such a panic my mom has disappeared for days. I don't know where she went. I want to sleep until it's over, but I can't even rest. Dad if you are gonna come back NOW is the time.

Day 14: Sunday

Dear, diary
Holy CRAP. THANK THE LORDS ABOVE!!! My dad has come back with the milk, but he gave worrying news.. He said over the course of the weekend. Among us has become a huge meme. Everyone is calling each other sus and beating each other up, and not only that, but my classmates have kidnapped my mother, and we need to save her.. If this is my last day. My final wishes are to destroy among us.

Day 42: Friday

Dear, Sarah
Sarah. I can't believe love was so blinding that it blinded me from how horrible you truly are. You lying snake. I will dance that you have been killed and are ridden from this world forever. I truly loved you and you started the suspocalypse. Jokes on you though, I'm safe with my mom in this forgotten bunker. You might've killed my dad, but he is in heaven for his sacrifice for the milk, his family, and the world. Now that we have your research papers we can work on a better future without the among us meme. Screw you Sarah you made Fridays worse than Mondays now. I will never forgive you. To anyone who finds this keep fighting. There's still people out there to end the suspocalypse. Stay strong.

P.S Love you dad. Thanks for everything.

(hope you enjoyed my story)"
7438,i like among us because of all the new fun roles they added. these roles really added fun to this game. and everything else love it. the maps are ok but the items to make your avatar amazing. the only thing i dont like is that some items cost money. but other than that is is a great game and  i would so recommend!

7511,"PINK FROM AMONG US RUINED MY MARRIAGE 
A couple months ago, my wife said she was going out for a ladies' night. She asked me to take care of my son, so I immediately obliged. ""Yes Ma'am,"" I told her. After a while of waiting, she finally left and I could play my favourite game, Among Us. I hopped on my laptop, booted it up and my desktop loaded, complete with the 'Red Sus' background and all my Among Us Impostor fan-art. I was shaking in excitement. I slowly dragged my finger across the track pad, and watched the cursor as it glided over to the Among Us icon. Among Us. My absolute favourite game of all time and quite possibly the best and most well-made game in the entire world. As I clicked the button my body twitched with joy at the thought of being the impostor again. My fingers drummed impatiently on my desk as the Innersloth logo faded in, and then out. Then the main title appeared. I immediately looked at pink as she slowly floated across the screen. Oh, how I wish I could feel those luscious, soft asscheeks. Pink is my queen. The real woman in my life. My wife could never be as sexy as Pink is; her soft footfalls in electrical as I peek at her curvy form from inside a vent, waiting for the right time to strike. I could never get close to Pink, however, as if she had some kind of sixth sense, she would always leave before I could reveal myself to her as the impostor. I press Practice, to warm up my fingers before my first intense game of Among Us. I hit Blue in Comms, then cross the hall and vent to Specimen, murdering Green in cold blood. The thrill of killing an animated character in an online game has never been such a rush. I then move towards Reactor, stabbing Yellow in the back and then running down the corridor to the right to access Decontamination. I move quietly through the halls, like a snake about to strike its prey, and I see- Oh no. It's Pink. Standing there motionlessly as I face her directly. Her visor shows no emotion. But she knows. I can feel it in the air. I can't kill her. She is too beautiful, too angelic, the light reflecting off of her pink bodysuit, like stars on a voided sky. She doesn't run. I am moved to tears as I caress the screen, kissing it tenderly. ""Goodbye, Pink. See you soon. It will all be okay,"" I whisper in a soft, reassuring voice. Then as my cursor hovers over the kill button, I hesitate. Thoughts of love go through my head. Red having reddish-pink sus children with Pink. But I have to. As the impostor, it is my duty to kill. I press the 'Kill' button and watch as my character beheads Pink silently. All I hear is the spurt of blood. There is no rush. There is only Red, standing by himself in Fuel. Pink's lifeless body laying on the floor beside him. I feel nothing at first, then immense sadness, like I'm at a loved one's funeral. My son knocks on the door, interrupting my brief moment of mourning. He asks, ""Dad? Are you going to make me a snack?"" I tell him to shut up, and my voice cracks. I break down sobbing. I killed her. I killed my one true love. God, forgive me. I open the door to my son, and he has a confused look on his face. I say nothing, and walk to the kitchen to make him a sandwich. Tears roll off my face into the bread as I lay it onto the counter. Lettuce, cheese and meat, followed by a sad swirl of mustard on top. My son is quiet. He sits on the couch, and stares at the floor. There is a depressing air around us. I serve him the sandwich and walk back to my room, contemplating life. If I killed Pink, how am I to be trusted around my family? I cry for hours, and finally my wife comes back. She sees me bawling on the bed like a child who dropped his ice cream. She then asks me why I'm crying and mutter, ""I killed her. I killed my only love, Pink, in Among Us."" She is filled with rage and slaps me across my face. I feel numb. She asks for a divorce. I don't reply. Instead, I take my laptop and get into my car, driving to a nearby hotel. Fast forward a few months to the divorce. It was quick and painless. After court, I ask my former wife to take me back."

Now i cannot play amoun go with normal chat because Im child (in game). 

Edit: I found a way to go over it and it haven't work. The idea was to send to myself child privacy settings to turn on all chat features on my own email. But then it ask me to type in my credit card. Wot the hell is wrong with this game? Firzt they try to told me that im young mini gamer 5 yo and they try to scam? 

Pls respond

Last week when we went to the supermarket, my son pointed to a red trash can and started jumping around screaming “THAT’S AMONG US! THAT TRASH CAN IS SUS! RED IS THE IMPOSTOR!” As soon as he did that, the manager told us to leave. I told him that my son is just excited about something, and apologised. But the manager still told us to leave so I picked up the red trash can that my son was going crazy over and threw it on the managers head. Then my son shouted “DEAD BODY REPORTED.” Can someone please tell me what on earth is wrong with him?"

7658,"I love this game. It is a fun game for friends to play together and get closer together. It brought my family closer by ironically lying to each other and backstabbing each other. This game is probably best played with people you know because sometimes online, there are plenty of players who just make the game not fun to play. But that isn't the game's fault. You can tell which lobbies have these kinds of players. And then there are lobbies with people who are fun to play with and don't vote random people just for the sake of it, they actually want to play and you end up meeting some cool people that way."

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died.

7703,coob game got meme ELETRACELS
7704,"There are 10 crew members trapped on a spacecraft, carrying out menial tasks to maintain vital systems, but at least one of them is an imposter who wants to sabotage their work and if possible, murder them. What sounds like the premise of a particularly bleak science-fiction movie is in fact the set-up of one of the most popular video games of the year. Developed by a three-person team at InnerSloth and launched to virtual obscurity in 2018, Among Us has suddenly become one of the biggest games on PC and mobile, attracting more than 85m players in the last six months. It’s so successful, InnerSloth recently abandoned plans to work on a sequel, instead piling their resources into the original. No one, it seems, is more surprised about the success of this game than its creators.

So why has this happened? Among Us is essentially an online multiplayer version of the party game wink murder, but set on a constantly malfunctioning spaceship. Up to 10 players take part, and at the beginning, you’re told whether you’re an innocent crew member or an imposter. While the former carry out jobs such as rebooting the communications systems or cleaning out the air ducts, the latter stalk the corridors breaking vital equipment or looking for victims to kill.

When a crew member discovers a body, they call a meeting, at which point all the players are allowed to talk to each other for a limited time. During these discussions, the crew needs to try to work out the identity of the imposter(s) by comparing alibis and reporting on which other players seem to have been acting suspiciously: what was Tim doing so close to the scene of the crime, and why can’t Emma recall what task she was apparently working on? Accusations fly, temporary alliances form and whopping lies are told. Sessions can often descend into anarchic shouting matches, with players frantically justifying their movements around the ship. Then a vote takes place, one player is hurled from the spaceship’s air locker, and the others discover if they’ve just saved themselves from certain death or murdered an innocent workmate.

As the game continues, the paranoia ramps up. Crew members can use security cameras to spy on others, while imposters can use air ducts to sneak around. Although there are traditional video game objectives to fulfil – the crew members can win the game if they complete all their allotted tasks before everyone is dead – this is essentially a game about acting; or, more accurately, it’s a game about lying to your friends. (You can play against strangers but it’s not as fun and there are a LOT of cheats out there.) The beauty of the game is the way in which it allows players to exploit the personality traits of their peers, tapping in on the neuroses of anxious players to create plausible guilt scenarios, or flattering egotists so that they don’t suspect you.

In short, this is all the fun of a slightly drunken board game night, but virtual, which makes it perfect for the semi-lockdown situation a lot of us are in right now. Brighter, cuter video games such as Fortnite and Animal Crossing proved popular during the early weeks of the coronavirus crisis, but now, after months of this horror, and with patience fraying, we’re ready for something more cynical and spiteful, something more akin to the end of a game night, where players are seconds from dropkicking the Trivial Pursuit board into next door’s garden.

There is, you may have spotted, something particularly 2020 about Among Us. Its emphasis on fabrication, on blame-shifting, and on reporting other people to the authorities is extremely on point. As writer Sean Sands points out in his excellent Vice article, “Among Us is rife with ever-cascading crises, and people trapped in a sense of isolation while they try to solve problems for which they are woefully unequipped. Into this crumbling world the game introduces a dash of bad-faith actors whose purpose – as much as open violence – is to sow distrust and distraction.”

The game gets you thinking about who it could be as imposters try and fool you in different ways? Game has lots of cosmetics to customize your bean how you like and they have even done some collabs and I hope they continue with more and bring old ones back! Plus great to hang out and chill with friends and others!"

However, if you like the flow of these kinds of games, this one will be a perfect match for you."

7771,"This game saved my life.

I am 37.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

7778,"Who are you talking to right now? Who is it that you think you see? Do you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I tell you, you wouldn’t believe it. Do you know what happens if I suddenly decide to stop going into work? A business big enough it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly-up. Gone. It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don’t know who you’re talking to so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, mommy. I am the danger. A guy opens his front door and gets shot, and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks."

A game of betrayal and suspense; even if this is my opinion, it's one of the best games I've played and helped me find a new fun game to play since 2020. Something I do think should be fixed, however, is that on the friends list underneath the friend codes there should be your friends' usernames so that everyone can know who they're sending game invites to."

Hide and seek mode would be so fun and cool, but i understand if it doesn't come as it's not the idea of the game.Only thing i dislike is that some players are really toxic and if you aren't the best in the game. They will call you bad and everything like that, but of course it isn't the game's fault that some people are like that. I also like the tasks and how there are so many that you won't have same tasks every game. I'll rate it 5/5! Love it!"

How strange these amogi can be, indeed! these strange little weird among us creatures can do anything they want to do. They are not bound by any chains exept for that of these amazing (and strange) little among us creatures that are so strange a skrunkly.

They have the boat where these amazing (and strange) little among us creatures can hide and play around with the other amogi, while still completeing their tasks like strange crewmate amongi. Wow! Inceredible, they are the among us charachters. It seems these amazing (and strange) little among us creatures can eat the other ones when they are doing impostor. How strange and skrunkly weird these amazing (and strange) little among us creatures are.

These creatures are not one-faceted, no no no no no no no no NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!!! These little among us creatures can also be doin the crewmate, wow impressive for you STUPID thing from among us. They can run around do task like a person, but no no no no NO !!! They are AMONG US! LITTLE CREATURES FROM THE GAME they are NOT RREAL I PROMISE.

wow this is so strange. They can do many things, but no no no no no NO. So strange these little among us creatures. It can be doin other peoples jobs. They can also be odd one-faceted creatures from the game.

Ah! what a strange little creature from the game. They can impersonate anyone. A monster or something that toons can not. How imposter can even be created.

Imposter will not be caught unless they do something unwise like accidently touch someone or get scared. Other characters might also laugh at them just like with imposter.

The crewmate will leave a rumor that for one of your characters... that he (or she) is thinking about sleeping around. Only one other character would guess it and that is another character who knows it. Then there might be a battle so both characters are caught in the roll of silence on someone that has not confirmed it with you.

I LOVE playing the Among us game where these little strange among us creature can be on the boat and scurry around with 100 Million Dollars. 

These little strange among us creatures can even be the captain of the ship.

Awesome.

wow this is so strange. They can do many things, but no no no no no no no NO NO NO NO NO!!!! These little strange among us creatures can even be the captain of the ship.

8029,"this game may be dead.. but if you can play it with friends or strangers in a discord server where u can take the game seriously, it is soo fun!! i was addicted to this game for a very long time"
8030,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

8137,"At its core, it's fun, but unless you can rally together enough friends to play a game or two, you will be cursed to play in public matches, where evidence doesn't mean anything and all that matters is that you accuse the loudest. I simply do not recommend playing with randoms.

On top of that, many of their updates have only made things worse. The Airship map, while a cool recreation of the Toppat Clan's air fortress from the Stickmin series, can be difficult to navigate and is very clearly designed for 15-player lobbies.
Speaking of which, the additional colours made for 15-player lobbies can be hard to distinguish at times, and that confusion is made worse by the new sub-classes, Allowing Impostors to pose as other players, certain Crewmates to vent, an ability previously exclusive to the Impostors, and dead players to momentarily render living teammates immune to attack. These new powers can create utter chaos in a game known for its simplicity and create so many variables it can be hard to put the Impostor on the spot or pull off a risky kill without knowing it will be countered or detected immediately.

It used to be the pillar of its genre, but nowadays I'd say look somewhere else."

8153,You need a better reporting system and there needs to be actual penalties for team playing. I have had to leave EVERY game this evening because of several players ADMITTING to team playing. It's not okay and ruins the experience for everyone playing.

8159,"It used to be fun, but then they added a ton of stuff, and no options to join lobbies without any of them.

You can't play what you want to play anymore because you can't filter lobbies for certain settings, so i have to cycle through tons of lobbies before i find one with settings i like. 

If you try to create your own lobby, you will be there for 30-45 minutes waiting for people to join, which half of them immediately leave.

I understand the game adding stuff and changing the game, because they don't want people to stop playing, but the creators failed to take into account that some players found the old game to be more fun. I could go on for hours about why I don't like the new roles, but all there needs to be is an option to filter lobbies by settings you want.

To have fun, you gotta get a group of people together and join a voice call or something, because the main game is not very fun anymore, and to play what you want (and have fun doing it) you need to get people with an iq over room temperature.

Another issue I have is the new colors they added. The old colors are easily identified, purple, green, light blue. But now, you gotta keep track of all the weird colors they have. There's like three pinks, all named differently, and very vague color names like maroon and banana. 

Don't get me wrong, this game can be fun with a group of people you know, but this review is based completely on the game, without any third party involved.

The game can still be fun, just take into account how some people want to play without certain settings, and don't want the decisions to be decided for them."

8168,"Among Us is a game for you if you like to feel accomplished. You can achieve many things and get well geared fairly quickly at the start of your world. Also, if you desire exploring, then I highly recomend this game. One of the best features (in my opinion) of this game is the fact that you can transfer your items across different worlds. So lets say if you wanted to
access another worlds loot, without starting from the beginning, simply select your character and create another world.

8281,"Honestly, I thought about giving this game a bad review for the simple fact that my game progression is gone. Like legit, I logged in one day and all my stats as well as everything I earned was gone. Contacting support did nothing, but I aint that petty. So I am going to point out some good and bad things I like about Among Us

PROS
[*]In hindsight this game is great. It has one thing that I find interesting, one of those being the fact that it allows you to use your brain and strategy. Trying to find out an imp, especially after the recent update with shapeshifters and the likes of engineers as an example. It makes it very difficult to find out, whereas I feel like winning as imp wasn't that great. Now you can't just camp with people all the time and hope you win the game by watching other win tasks. I really do love the fact that they added in these new roles to make the game very refreshing. 

Now, do I have anything else positive to say about this game...... well no. In fact I havee so much negative shit to say about this game than positive, yet I still like the game. Let's do the 
CONS

[*] This game.... have way too many damn kids on here. Since this is avaialbe on pc AND mobile, where the mobile version is free it runs rampant with dumb kids, who are always somehow horny for some reason and do not know how to play this game at all. They are literally braindead and do not really know the true purpose of this game, which is annoying when you're joining random lobbies. It's hard to come across people who use more than one braincell. This of all cons will literally follow into every other con I have about this game. Which makes me go to the 2nd con 

[*] There is nobody... smart in this game. People are so quick to accuse you of being an impostor, despite no proof of so. Even if you are somehow an imp they don't draw this from any evidence. I have seen waaay too many times where people will vote you off because someone finds you to be ""sus."" You are following someone? You're sus. You are standing still? Sus. People follow others too much. Like I am not saying go off and do whatever the entire game. Checking up on someone every once in awhile is good, but it gets to a point where you legit see what every tasks one person is doing, then you rule them out due to an alibi. Which is a VERY double edged sword and something I like to use for fun (more onto that later) Pretty much this game is BLIND MOB CONTROL! You could just say that you saw someone vent and INSTANTLY KICKED OFF. I like to play the role as a ""detective"" so to speak and it's funny because I am the only one using common sense I get voted off. 

[*] Teaming is rampant in this game and annoying and also due to many kids playing this game. Because a player gets salty that they got kicked out, they pretty much tell their friend who reveal who the killer is. Or they say some shit like ""It's blue!"" Like bruh. You're ruining the game and it provides no fun. People don't even try to play the game they just want to know who the imp is, which is a part of the game... yes but it doesn't make it ANY FUN whatsoever. Like at least try and figure out who the fuck it could be but noooo! I want to just win. The just win attitude ruin games in my honest opinion. Then you have people call a meeting every goddamn second just to say they are not imp or some shit like, come see me do a tasks. This game is so frustrating to play for sure. 

[*] The disconnection is rampant in this game. You would THINK after years and when this game blew up, the devs would be able to make a better game to the point people don't get kicked for an error BUT NO! People in 2022 are still getting kicked out of games, the server issues is a huge damn problem and it seems like they never addressed this. I, myself, have never been dc'd but so many people have and you can tell because it tells you. This is nothing like someone leaving a game. Just fix your issues. 

Pretty sure there are more when I initiated wanted to write this review, but cannot think of any right now. Basically I wish this game had a more mature playerbase and of course you can find those by looking in groups but if I want to just join a random damn lobby and play the game it's very difficult. I enjoy the game for what it is and when I get actually intelligent people it is very fun. 

-May update this in the future."

8293,"Game asks for my social security number, not sure why they need that but I don't feel like having a real life imposter steal my identity. I really enjoy being able to take out a loan from a bank but if someone takes me social security number I can't do that. Why do you need a debit or credit card to verify the age of an adult? A child could have access to a parent's card information, have you people not heard the stories of kids buying thousands worth of vbucks. What is the worse thing that is going to happen to a child on AMONG US???!?!??!?!?! The worst thing that could happen is nothing absolutely nothing. Even Minecraft has looser restrictions than this horrible game. I can't even chat and I am an adult yet I have to use quick chat because my non existent absent parent/guardian cannot verify it.

I also couldn't connect to the North America region of Among Us because the servers were full, so I changed my region to Europe.

EXT. TO'HAJIILEE Native American Reservation

Pair of pants fly through the sky, an RV flies by and runs them over

CUT TO: INSIDE the Winnebago RV

The driver is wearing a gas mask, driving the RV frantically, glances to the passenger's seat to find another man passed out with a gas mask on. We briefly see two bodies, lab equipment, wads of money, and some type of sludge in the back of the RV. The driver tries to keep the RV on the road before crashing into bushes off the side of the road

CUT TO: OUTSIDE the Winnebago
The driver exits the RV, coughing heavily, wearing only his underwear. He goes into a fit of rage when he sees the RV is wrecked, and hurls his mask away from the vehicle

“DRIVER”: Shit!

Then panic. He hears sirens. The driver puts a shirt on, mumbling to himself the whole time, then re-enters the RV, holding his breath. He grabs the gun out of the hand of a man on the floor, and a wallet and camcorder from the glove box

“DRIVER”: To the camera My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroya Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87104. To all law enforcement entities, this is not an admission of guilt. I am speaking to my family now.

Covers the camera with his hand, crying. Composes himself, then...

WALTER WHITE: Skyler, you are the love of my life. I hope you know that. Walter Jr., you're my big man. There are going to be some things that you're going to come to learn about me in the next few days. I just want you to know that no matter how it may look, I only had you in my heart.

Walt turns to look for the oncoming sirens

WALTER WHITE: Goodbye

Turns off camera, lays wallet on the ground, takes the gun out of the waistband of his underwear. He is clearly shaken but determined. He walks up to the road, gun in hand, waiting for what he presumes to be police cars. Then he raises his gun, ready to shoot the first person that comes his way

END OF TEASER
CUT TO: WHITE HOUSE, master bedroom

*Walt's wife Skyler is sleeping while he lays next to her, wide awake. 5:02 AM.

CUT TO: WHITE HOUSE, spare bedroom

*Walt and Skyler are expecting a baby. There is an empty crib, as well as Pampers and an unopened baby monitor. Walt walks over to his stair-stepper and starts exercising. Camera pans to the wall, where we see a plaque awarded to Walt for research that led to a Nobel Prize in 1985. Walt gets off the stair-stepper*
CUT TO: WHITE HOUSE, kitchen, morning

Skyler hands Walt his breakfast, scrambled eggs and pieces of bacon in the shape of the number 50

SKYLER WHITE: Happy birthday. Kisses Walt on the cheek

WALT: Look at that

SKYLER: That is veggie bacon, believe it or not. Zero cholesterol and you won't even taste the difference.

WALTER: Hmm. sniffs veggie bacon

SKYLER: What time do you think you'll be home?

WALT: Same time.

SKYLER: I don't want him dicking you around tonight. You get paid til 5, you work til 5, no later.

Walter White Jr. enters the room, wearing forearm crutches

WALT JR (to both parents): Hey.

WALT JR (to Walt): Happy birthday!

WALT: Why thank you!
SKYLER (cutting Walt off): You're late...again.

WALT JR: There was no hot water...again.

SKYLER: I have an easy fix for that. You wake up early, and then you get to be the first person in the shower.

WALT JR: I have an idea. How about buy a new hot water heater? How's that idea? For the millionth, billionth time.

Walt starts coughing

SKYLER: Did you take your echinacea?

WALT: Yup. I think it's getting better.

WALT JR (interrupting them): What the hell is this?

SKYLER: Hey--

WALT: --it's veggie bacon. Watching our cholesterol... I guess.

WALT JR: Not me, I want real bacon. None of this fake crap.

SKYLER: Too bad, eat it.

WALT JR: Phew. This smells like Band-Aids.

SKYLER: Eat. it.

Walt Jr. makes a face at Skyler

WALT JR (to Walt): So, how's it feel to be old?

WALT: How does it feel to be a smartass?

WALT JR: Good.

WALT: Eat your veggie bacon.

CUT TO: J.P. WYNNE HIGH SCHOOL, morning

Walt pulls his Pontiak Aztek into Walt Jr.'s handicap spot

WALT (seeing Jr. is struggling with the door): You all set?

WALT JR: Yeah, I'm fine.

WALT: Alright, see you in a little.

WALT JR: OK, seeya.

Morning bell rings

CUT TO: Walt's CLASSROOM

WALT: Chemistry. It is the study of what?

Camera pans to the students, most of which are ignoring him

WALT: Anyone?

One student raises his hand

WALT: Ben?

BEN: Chemicals.

WALT: Chemicals! No. Chemistry is... Well technically, chemistry is the study of matter. But I prefer to see it as the study of change. Now just... Just think about this.

Walt turns on the gas in the front of the classroom and sparks a fire

WALT: Electrons change their energy levels. Molecules change their bonds.

Walt starts spraying Windex bottles full of chemicals at the fire, each one changing the fire to a different color. This causes some students to look up

WALT: Elements, they combine and change into compounds. Well that's, that's all of life, right? I mean it's just the constant, it's the cycle, it's solution...dissolution. Just over and over and over.

Camera pans to the back of the class where two students are ignoring Walt and flirting

WALT: It is growth, then decay, then transformation. It is fascinating, really.

Walt looks up and sees the two students.

WALT: Chad. Is there something wrong with your table?

Chad stands up

WALT: OK. Ionic bonds...

Chad drags his stool back to his desk, making as much noise as possible

WALT: Are you done? Ionic bonds, chapter 6.

CUT TO: TEACHER'S LOUNGE

Walt is eating a sandwich alone

CUT TO: A1A CARWASH

Walt is working inside as a cashier

WALT: 1, 2, 3 makes 10, and 10 makes 20. Here's your receipt. Just give this to your carwash professional. Thank you, come again.

Camera pans to show the carwash owner, Bogdan Wolynetz, yelling at someone in Romanian over the phone. Bogdan walks over to Walt

BOGDAN: He's not coming. He says he quits. I'm gonna run the register.

WALT: Bogdan, no. We talked about this.

BOGDAN: I'm shorthanded, Walter. What am I to do?

Walt looks like he has something to say but ends up looking away

BOGDAN: Walter?

Walter furiously storms out of the room and goes outside to wipe cars down

BOGDAN: What am I to do?

CUT TO: The OUTSIDE of the carwash, where workers are cleaning and wiping cars down

Walt carries his bucket over to an orange sports car and begins cleaning the wheels, coughing as he does it.

CHAD: Hey, Mr. White!

Chad takes a picture of Walt cleaning the car on his cell phone

CHAD: Makes those tires shine, huh?

CHAD'S GIRLFRIEND (on the phone): Oh my god! You will not believe who's cleaning Chad's car

Walt continues to clean the wheel, clearly humiliated

CUT TO: INSIDE Walt's car, after work

Walt tries to stick Junior's handicap placard in the glove compartment. He's unable to close the glove box and grows frustrated. He forces himself to hold down the anger that's been building throughout the day

CUT TO: WHITE HOUSE

Walt walks in the front door

EVERYONE: Surprise!!

Walt is shocked

SKYLER: Hands Walt a beer, kisses him You are so very late

Camera focuses on Skyler talking to two other women

CARMEN MOLINA: Really, I'm serious Skyler. I mean you're flat as a washboard. You look awesome. To other woman She's not showing at all is she?

MARIE SCHRADER: She's showing a little.

Awkward pause

SKYLER: Carmen, this is my sister Marie.

CARMEN: Nice to meet you.

MARIE: Hi.

Camera zooms in on a gun being pulled out in another room

AGENT HANK SCHRADER: Glock 22. That's my daily carry, OK. I mean unless you're talking, what, Plus V Plus slugs, you forget the 9 mill, alright. Shit, I've seen one of those bounce of a windshield one time.

STEVE GOMEZ: Yeah, with you shooting.

Everyone laughs

HANK: If you're gonna bring a gun, baby, you gotta bring enough gun.

Hank hands a gun to Walt Jr., Walt looks across the room concerned

HANK: 40 caliber.

WALT JR: This is awesome right here.

HANK: Nice, isn't it?

8413,"Mao Zedong[a] (December 26, 1893 – September 9, 1976), also known as Chairman Mao, was a Chinese communist revolutionary who was the founder of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which he led as the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party from the establishment of the PRC in 1949 until his death in 1976. Ideologically a Marxist–Leninist, his theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as Maoism.

Mao was the son of a prosperous peasant in Shaoshan, Hunan. He supported Chinese nationalism and had an anti-imperialist outlook early in his life, and was particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919. He later adopted Marxism–Leninism while working at Peking University as a librarian and became a founding member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. During the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP, Mao helped to found the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, led the Jiangxi Soviet's radical land policies, and ultimately became head of the CCP during the Long March. Although the CCP temporarily allied with the KMT under the Second United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), China's civil war resumed after Japan's surrender, and Mao's forces defeated the Nationalist government, which withdrew to Taiwan in 1949.

On October 1, 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the PRC, a Marxist–Leninist single-party state controlled by the CCP. In the following years he solidified his control through the Chinese Land Reform against landlords, the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, the ""Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns"", and through a psychological victory in the Korean War, which altogether resulted in the deaths of several million Chinese. From 1953 to 1958, Mao played an important role in enforcing planned economy in China, constructing the first Constitution of the PRC, launching the industrialisation program, and initiating military projects such as the ""Two Bombs, One Satellite"" project and Project 523. His foreign policies during this time were dominated by the Sino-Soviet split which drove a wedge between China and the Soviet Union. In 1955, Mao launched the Sufan movement, and in 1957 he launched the Anti-Rightist Campaign, in which at least 550,000 people, mostly intellectuals and dissidents, were persecuted. In 1958, he launched the Great Leap Forward that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from agrarian to industrial, which led to the deadliest famine in history and the deaths of 15–55 million people between 1958 and 1962. In 1963, Mao launched the Socialist Education Movement, and in 1966 he initiated the Cultural Revolution, a program to remove ""counter-revolutionary"" elements in Chinese society which lasted 10 years and was marked by violent class struggle, widespread destruction of cultural artifacts, and an unprecedented elevation of Mao's cult of personality. Tens of millions of people were persecuted during the Revolution, while the estimated number of deaths ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions. After years of ill health, Mao suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976 and died at the age of 82. During Mao's era, China's population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million while the government did not strictly enforce its family planning policy.

A controversial figure within and outside China, Mao is still regarded as one of the most important individuals in the twentieth century. Beyond politics, Mao is also known as a theorist, military strategist, and poet. During the Mao era, China was heavily involved with other southeast Asian communist conflicts such as the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cambodian Civil War, which brought the Khmer Rouge to power. He ruled China through an autocratic and totalitarian regime responsible for mass repression as well as destruction of religious and cultural artifacts and sites.[2] The government was responsible for vast numbers of deaths with estimates ranging from 40 to 80 million victims through starvation, persecution, prison labour, and mass executions.[3][4][5][6] Mao has been praised for transforming China from a semi-colony to a leading world power, with greatly advanced literacy, women's rights, basic healthcare, primary education and life expectancy.[7][8][9][10]"

8440,"As fun as it was before. The new stuff that you can't chat without ""parential"" stuff is quite annoying besides we pay for the game and we gotta pay extra just to unlock features? I know a small small fee but still! The other verification option includes giving your last 4 Digits of your SSN (social security number). If someone gets their hands on the last 4 digits then its easy for the person to commit identity theft. All this stuff is just gotten too much."

8467,"What do you want me to say? Upon its release, AMONG US was an instant classic. It's a simple game with great atmosphere. There's murder and mayhem and it's still really cute. Now they've implemented some cool new stuff over the years to keep players engaged. If you like Werwolf type of games, this might be for you. And oh, all the memes ..."
8468,fun to kill and talk to people when responsible
8469,"I've heard the phrase among us for so many years that the word among doesn't even look like a word anymore. My life is falling apart, I lost my job due to a depressive episode. Granted, it was an entry-level job and I didn't really like it there anyway. Besides that, this game is great if you're with friends in a discord call and want to waste some time. The game is just like any other hidden role game but this time with extra steps and opportunities to create an alibi."
8470,"I mean , its okay , But its the same thing kinda over and over , But overall Its an AMAZING game! I recommed this game!

Playing Among Us in real life, spaceship with my crew
Gonna split up, spread out 'cause we all got tasks to do
Gotta find the imposter as they try to sabotage
Who can we trust in this Among Us entourage?
Heard a sound, turned around, looking up, looking down
Then I find a dead body
Gotta blow the horn, emergency discussion, who should we believe?
Can't decide, so, now we leave, not sure what I'm about to see
Will it be a dead body? Still have a task I must complete"

8531,Was good for all of a few months. Dead game now
8532,"I have played this game A LOT, since it came out, but I want to do a quick comparison.  Fall Guys came out/blew up around the same time.  Among Us got lucky with the streamer blow up, different streamers come together to play.  But they did nothing to get the game to the level it should be.  Lets check the time frame, in the two or three years since they came out/blew up Fall Guys has provided soooo many new maps with different variations, tons of new cosmetics, and a bunch of different challenges.  Whereas Among Us, in that same time frame, has given us one new map, which is riddiculosy large and not really fun to play, a couple new roles, and some cubes that everyone has already maxed out.  I have over 130k beans and nothing to spend them on.  Still no pets or banners to buy.  Basically, Among Us failed to take advantage of what they had and just milked it.  They could've upgraded their servers, hired people to help make the game great, but they didn't.  I wasted a lot of time on this game hopping that maybe they'd get their head out of their asses and make this game great, but they didn't.  Just keep milking your useless, and I'm going to keep playing Fall Guys, because at least they're trying to add new things and make their game fun to play.  I honestly hope this game fails and dies out, because god knows they will actually improve there game.  If your new to it, enjoy it for about a month or two before it gets old and repetative, and know that they will never add anything new because they're still milking the blow up from streamers.  Intersloth is worthless"

8590,"It may have originally come out in 2018, but Among Us took 2020 by storm, and it's deserving of that spotlight. Innersloth has made the tense, multiplayer fun of in-person cloak and dagger games like Mafia and Werewolf work on PC, mobile, and consoles with a flourish. And the great times I've had slaying, lying, and sleuthing my way through its charming sci-fi world got me wondering why it took so long for this sort of game to catch on. There are still a few technical hitches to be worked out, just like the fussy engines on the Skeld, but that hasn't kept me from coming back to it again and again in my down time.

The premise of Among Us is simple enough that just about anyone can pick it up quickly: eight crew members dash around a claustrophobic, cartoon spaceship to complete simple minigames and fill up a shared progress bar. But among them are two hidden impostors with the goal of secretly murdering everyone until they equal or outnumber the crew and claim victory. And yet, like so many excellent multiplayer games, it's very tricky to master because it’s about fooling real people, not gaming an AI. You can't even fall back on the same successful strategies too often or your opponents will catch on, so sometimes you have to mix things up and maybe even act illogically to keep them guessing.

The art is whimsical, with your bulbous, quirky astronauts stumbling around engine bays and reactor decks that look like the doodles I used to do in the margins of my notes in school. This is effective for a couple of reasons. For one, it keeps the mood pretty light, which is important in a game where you're going to be lying to, and being lied to, by your friends every single round. It's hard to take getting ganked in the middle of a task for the fifth time too personally when the animation for your demise makes you laugh after you're done yelling. The art style also makes interacting with the various machines and doodads on the map intuitive and enjoyable. I was able to drop right into my first match and get a decent grasp of what was going on without needing much help."
8591,"it's a fun game and i do recommend it to everyone who loves murder mystery games
"
8592,good game :steamhappy:
8593,Among Us memes are gonna be the death of me.

8606,"At it's core, Among Us may seem as an sussy imposter ""baka."" But it's truly the most beautiful work of art, I have ever laid my eyes on.

No other video game has unleashed my creativity like Minecraft. I've spent countless hours chipping away at blocks, gathering the necessary materials to complete the next masterpiece that would otherwise only occupy my mind's eye. I've also spent just as many hours exploring, spelunking and slashing my way through monsters with bravado. My character – my entire Minecraft world – constantly evolves into whatever I want it to be. I tell my own stories, I write my own destiny and I bring my fantasies to life one brick at a time. 

sus"
8607,"Among Us is a very popular murder mystery detective game. Whilst the game has its flaws such as the imposter teaming with crew mates, it is a very polished and well rounded game designed for hours of fun. I am President Joe Biden and I approve this message."
8608,a good game to play with friends but overall without friends you're either just a nerd or a socially rejected loser
8609,nice
8610,Fun
8611,very sussy game
8612,"Morbius is the great. Truly the best cinema has to offer, I never expected a live action movie of Scooby Doo to hit me harder than my da-I mean, harder than my failing grades. Truly the best the Forza franchise has to offer with unbelievable graphics stunning visuals, Amorbus really shows you how Walter White who lives at 308 negra arroyo lane thinks by cooking cocainer and getting stage 4 terminal cancer(weird I always thought that was a zodiac sign). Watch as Jesse Purpleman completely causes a bathtub to disintegrate using his makings of a varisty athlete which is also shown by Tony Soprano whom decides to get into a car crash caused by a blown tire which was invented by 7 time Piston Cup Champion, Lightning Mcqueen(Owen Wilson was suspected to be the same person as mcqueen but clearly they are nothing alike). Gran Turismo 7 will show you how a sim racer can simulate everything except my 1 braincell struggling to type this out, truly the pros of this show never stop with so many good things happening such as the end credits. Truly this show exposes Hololive and how Yagoo may be the best girl but it's a long shot, however I wholeheartedly believe that all good things can happen with longshots like the sniper that I wish blew my heas off midway through Morbidly Obese. Truly I have no complaints about the latest installment of the Halo Franchise, Halo I can't Reach the top shelf which I think comes after Halo Infinity gauntlet wielded by my favourite superhero Josh Bowling. Lewis Hamilton holds the record for the most race wins in Formula One history, with 103 wins to date, his latest win was achieved in a car(unexpected!!). Truly Lewis shows how hammertime can be achieved however Max Verstoppen won the f1 world championship over him in 2021 by throwing pit cars at him summoning his stand Michael Massi, as you know standing was invented by Jojo's Bizarre Adventure before this people could not stand, much like how my thumb can't stand
typing this like Kendrick Lamar after Franklin tells him he can't stay at his crib this angers Kendrick Lamar causing Kendrick Lamar to say Franklin shouldn't hate Kendrick because he is pretty and calls out that if Franklin got of that terrible haircut and how his counterpart may contact him via telephone thus contacting him and stop having sexual intercourse with a brain surgeon or lawyer. Thus a movie with many layers like a onion or a ogre. Whoever said this movie was the greatest installment of the Diary Of Wimpy Kid, you are wrong because morse code clearly is worse than Diary Of A Wimpy Kid:Rodrick Rules. Clearly they captured the essence of that flim but missed the mark slightly. Thus I conclude my review on Morbidly Morbus Amogus Amorbus A bus, simply wonderful with incredible gameplay and a surreal experience provided by the IMAX theatres that'll take your breath away like Berlin's hit song ""Take My Breath Away"" from the hit movie Top Gun which takes place on Earth which morbius doesn't since morbius takes place in New York often confused with Earth and along with Mississippi. All in all great soap opera I enjoyed the orchestra and thoroughly enjoyed the Kayne West concert in which he played Fellas In Paris 11 times in Paris for over 40 minutes I rate this a ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) out of ඞ.
I cried when Mobius and venom said ""its morbin time"" and proceeded to become venom,also My good friend bryant moreland was also there , (he is known as EDP445) ""And he didnt really do anything wrong just so everyone knows he is innocent and just wanted a cupcake."" because we are venom , and then I started crying when venom teamed up with morbingus and killed spider man from the hit game among us, And then the among us imposter came into the scene and killed scooby doo and fortnite for possesion of illegal drugs , Than lebron james and among us team up with venom and morbingus to take over the world of the space jam, and than after that Rkelly and sonic2 attacked them and then they almost died but morbiobus and lebron james welcomed them to the space jam, and then they played the game team fortress 2 , which was developed by valve who owns will smiths children and family, who I have in my basement steam, After this the movie seems over and calm until the red sus from among us comes from vent and says ""among us sus"" which almost kills venom from the hit movie space jam a new legacy, I also liked the part when venom nukes russia and ukraine and morbiobusbus attacks ukraine with stinky poop, which was kinda scary but honestly I think lebron james and R kelly were great heroes and villans, And then hitler comes back from the dead and tries to kill bee movie, and then among us poo saves bee movie from hitler and they are saved. Morlibbingorbgarfieldiarywimrkellbious was so good and I was so suprised when dwayne ""the rock"" johnson appeared, (stars in jungle movie ) And eats the imposter and says ""among us challenge number 7"" than among us challenge number 7 commences and than number 6 man urinates on a fellow passenger attacks Dwayne ""The rock"" Johnson and his twin brother barack obama who starts brutally killing number 8 and kanye east which made me cry fart and scream
at the same time. I think garfield and among us were a pretty good duo as they were both sussy, and garfield does not like mondays as shown in the hit show 1000 pound sisters and then the sus from among us starts having a moment
where venom and kendrick lamar sings the hit song called venom by the popular rapper eminem which goes like this ""venom, venom, venom, venom"", and dies, It was so sad when jeffrey epstien and lil mosey died because his cameo was so good. I think this sheds good light on diary of a wimpy kid game six where the kid and EDP445 are against Michael Jordan in the 92-93 nba season. Such a great movie, and I have never seen something this great before,h I got kicked out of my job for ""workplace harassment"" I was just trying to explain how morbiobus was the best thing to ever be made by human kind, Cant wait for my restraining order to be lifted so I can see my kids again. im sorry laura please let me see my son ""its been 6 years im not crazy, im just a morbster and you have to accept me for that please let me see my kids and watch the hit game among us in movie form with morbious laura im sorry . Its morbin time, and I love among us so much and I want my family back,also, eddie brock, and venom who combine into venom and say their hit catchphrase ""we are venom"" and start yelling welcome to the space jam I actually died for a couple seconds and got send to the ER but once on the hospital bed, I got up and ran out as I had to see morbingus and kanye west pooping in 1080p ultra hd if i did not i knew i would die and I wont pretend that I am morbious and start rolling around the floor with explosive diarrhea again, and I will not use the kids as hostages in any more among us poo #morbioussweep please rate helpfull"

8617,"among us is everywhere
I can't fucking take it. I see an image of a random object posted and then I see it, I fucking see it. ""Oh that looks kinda like the among us guy"" it started as. That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a fridge that looked like among us, I'd see an animated bag of chips that looked like among us, I'd see a hat that looked like among us. And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than ""sus."" I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is ""red sus"" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word ""among"" is ruined. The phrase ""among us"" is ruined. I can't live anymore. Among us has destroyed my fucking life. I want to eject myself from this plane of existence. MAKE IT STOP!"
8618,it fucking sucks dont buy it
8619,Sus
8620,its like the attack i did to my parents! very fun game!
8621,"Among Us lives up to the hype created by its delayed explosion in popularity, for the most part. It's a style of intense, refreshing multiplayer experience that simply didn't catch on digitally before recently. Its well-earned following speaks to just how enticing murdering and deceiving your friends can be, as well as Innersloth's endearing art, approachability, and clever minigame design. I don't have any sus that this will be the last game of its breed to make a splash, since we’re already seeing its influence on even mega-games like Fortnite. But it’s the breakout hit for the genre, and it's a great first impression."

The tasks are generally simple, but cute and entertaining, and the meetings give you a chance to try your detective skills and discover who the Impostor is - or to use this knowledge to your advantage and vote off innocent Crewmates. It's not an amazing game, but it's a decent time-killer."

8729,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

8782,"I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to play Among Us.

What we came across in the discord server that day was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on logs were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never said those words. I should have stopped talking and though about what we were going through.

There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the internet. I want to apologize to anyone who has seen the photo. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologize to the victim and his family.

For my Discord Kittens who are defending my actions, please don't. I don’t deserve to be defended. My goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven, I’m just here to apologize. I'm ashamed of myself. I’m disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you."

[*]People are spamming DC all time.

[*]Premade players can cheat/call each other ?? (idk i'm not sure)

When the expedition explored only my buddy Jim and one of his crewmates came back. They were asked what happened and he said that one person tried to kill and sabatoge the whole crew. They said there was some kind of force out there that was forcing them to act badly. They never speak about it again. Good game 4/5 stars one star off for starting his PTSD  back up again."

I didn't think much of it and the game set me to 1 year old and said I needed Guardian permission to play. I thought it was funny and had a laugh until it sent me to a website to sign up for my ""child"".

The game will not let you play with friends unless you give them your credit card number or SSN. I wish I was making it up, but it is that scummy of a game to force you to give away your private information if you want to play with friends at all. Don't buy this game, it's the scummiest system I've ever seen for a modern game. Misclick once and you're locked out of your game. There is no customer support.

If a dev wants to fix the issue, I'd love to work it out. There is no excuse for wanting private information and being unable to speak to someone about it."

8946,"Despite the occasional creeps and jerks, once you find a good lobby it really is a fun game."
8947,fun
8948,Too many predators use the game. People roleplaying adult situations and preying on under age kids. It takes the enjoyment out of the game and makes it a dangerous space rather than one of fun. There needs to be a censor for anything sexual. Room names are inappropriate and contain things like 'join for d pics' and so on. The creators need to crack down on such things so that the game can actually be played and not used to solicit sex from people.

9090,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

9096,"This game has caused my life to enroll into an uncurbsideable nightmare. It all started on thy fateful day, November 24th, 1671, when me and my boatmates landed at Boston, Massachusetts. There, me and my homies (from the boat) went to an Eminem concert, where we ate fried pickles and mayonnaise all day. After the concert subsides, Guy Fieri falls out of the orbit of his home planet, Kepler 69-P, and lands straight next to Eminem, who at the time was talking about his Funko Pop collection. Guy Fieri is soon demolished however, as Oprah falls from her home planet, Venus. Given this is Oprah, she of course had to make this a large, public issue about her life. Oprah and Eminem duel it out (in a cool manner) and slowly start mutilating each other to death. Eminem wins this duel barely, and me and my homies (from the boat) cheered on immensely, however, THE IMPOSTOR FROM AMONGUS drop kicks Eminem like a cloaker from the hit-game Payday 2, made by OVERKILL and published by 505 Games in 2013 for Windows, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Playstation 4, Xbox 1, Nintendo Switch, and more. The impostor (from amongus) kills Eminem and steals his skin to wear it (like the shapeshifter from the actual game!) Después de la ocurrencia, el impostor de Among Us es asesinado al lado de los peregrinos del Mayflower (it is 1671, after all,) and we celebrate by contracting Smallpox and dying a painful death (it is 1671 in Boston, Massachusetts, after all.) In conclusion, I do not recommend this game because Eminem killed Oprah, who killed Guy Fieri, who crashed into the planet, in which Eminem was killed by the impostor (from amongus,) until los peregrinos del Mayflower brutally slaughter the impostor (from Amongus,) as me and my homies (from the boat) ate fried pickles and Mayonnaise.

9104,"During the Las Vegas shooting Stephen Paddock supposedly expent 3000+ rounds of ammunition over the course of ten minutes from 27 AR-15's with bumpstocks despite the facts that it would have required him to drop a gun after each 30 round magazine was empty, even though videos from survivors show that it was a nonstop stream of ammunition with a firing rate much higher than a bumpstock is capable of producing from multiple locations that appear to be M240 LMG's. More interesting is the fact that after the FBI took over the investigation, his house somehow burned down with all of the evidence, and photos of the hotel room he shot from only show 50 spent shells. Years later we still have no motivation, and there was strangely no follow up on the biggest mass shooting in US history. Most confusing is that the day after his brother had numerous press interviews where he claimed it made no sense, he was arrested for possessing several hundred terabytes of child porn on a 20 year old computer running Windows 95, at least according to the photos taken by the FBI.

Anyways, game is good. very fun to play and enjoyed it."

Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playin'
""We're just friends,"" what are you sayin'?
Said ""there's another,"" and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
For you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we're here together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us who could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound
I skip a beat when I see her in the street
And at school on the playground
But I really wanna see her on a weekend
She know she got me dazin' 'cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin' but I just keep on sayin'
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
I'm all gone

I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth. If you still even remember that name. But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift. Nor, have you been called here by the individual you assume. Although, you have indeed been called. You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit. A maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust of blood has driven you in endless circles. Chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near. Yet somehow out of reach. But, you will never find them. None of you will.
This is where your story ends. And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although, there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered and the memory of everything that started this, can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors. Be still. And give up your spirits. They don't belong to you. As for most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps, warm, waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole. So, don't keep the Devil waiting, friend. My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up in their arms, the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you, I should have known, you wouldn't be content to disappear. Not my daughter. I couldn't save you then. So, let me save you now. It's time to rest, for you, and for those you have carried in your arms... This ends. For all of us.

9187,"It is a great game to play.... with friends and I cannot stress this enough.

Playing with friends or a group is fun especially since there is not voice in the game. Discord or a voice server can be used but it does remove a little bit from the game. Mainly because I'm a horrible liar when I talk. With text chat I have a chance.

Otherwise people quit all the time if they do not get to be an imposter in the round. Start a round with random people online and about 5 to 8 people are guaranteed to quit out in the beginning of the round... It is really annoying. Like playing with whiny kids that quit if they do not get their way...

The game itself is awesome but the online community is toxic."

9214,"[h1] The game that changed gaming. [/h1]

Among Us is the game that has achieved success in uniting new and old gamers alike. Its gameplay is extremely simple and recognizable, making it easy for new gamers to join. If you have never heard of Among Us, you will be put into Crewmates or Imposters. 

[u] Crewmates [/u] are the most common roles. Their main objectives are to discover who the imposters are and to complete their tasks. They win by voting out all imposters or filling the task bar. 

[u] Imposters [/u] are a small group of about 1-3 people. Their main objective is to kill all crewmates so that it's equal to the number of imposters alive. Imposters have got to be slick and be smart about their murders. They can also sabotage many electronics on maps, which, if not fully repaired, can result in a game over. 

It's a great game for someone who is new to games because it's so simple and addicting. You can play with friends, change settings, and customize your little character. while also being able to change many settings and even add mods to add more roles. Among Us will be here for many generations to come."

It has turned into a dating / hook up site with grown men and teens trying to get young children's Snapchat's and numbers , Please be aware of grooming and inappropriate chats within the lobbies. This is not being taken seriously enough , they will single you out if you appear to be what they are looking for and a lot of young or impressionable people are falling for it ! ""reporting"" or ""blocking""  isn't stopping the issue, It's just passing it on to someone else to fall victim to.

9403,"When will the developers realize their game is dying and is entirely full of child predators and horny teenage kids... the entire lobby listing occasionally has one legit actual lobby and the rest are ""Horny boy"" or ""horny girl"" or ""looking for Gfs snap only"" and if you say start the game they ban you from the lobbies intentionally just sitting around begging for snapchats... its disgusting and they really need to address this bs. the game is a cesspool of degenerates that can't even function appropriately in society as actual human beings so they revert to being disgusting incels in a game designed for a predominantly child based audience.. (or so it seems to be catering to a child demographic) but still its entirely disgusting and I refuse to play a dead game full of horny kids and disgraceful pedophiles... there are so many better games to invest your time into rather than spending $4.99 USD just to be leaving and joining random lobbies trying to find one thats actual players and not horny men and children/teens trying to get a rise off of others and lure in kids/other kids/adults into their social media presence with malicious intent. the game at this point should either just go free or entirely shutdown the servers and have a new system implemented to remove anyone/ban anyone who use keyterms that cater to sexual activity and remove individual lobbies that have been sitting in the hub waiting for others for more than 10-15 minutes.. just a personal though though so please don't discriminate but it had to be said..."

It's exactly what it says on the tin, a fun family friendly (mostly) social deduction game where you try to find out who the alien impostor is.

9522,"good game, very simple, but great fun with your friends."
9523,"Amazing Game! So much you could do! Customize your Character, Make Friends, ( and betray them, lol! ) Overall, a GREAT game!"
9524,"Okay, where do I start.

This game is intense and fun. If you get crewmate, then you have to make sure you aren't ""sus"", or suspicious, and finish your tasks and hope that the impostor doesn't kill you. The new updates for this game are really interesting and awesome, and the developer(s) keep doing them rather then getting the game out and never updating it.

Also, it is super cheap. It is one of the cheapest games (other then the free ones) that I could find on Steam. Only $3.99! It is worth more than that, in my opinion.

When I started playing, I had tried it on mobile, and wasn't really into it because I couldn't get an account. Now, I signed in immediately, can chat freely, and change my name instead of randomizing it for an hour to search for something I like. I was hooked! 

But there is a little bit of violence, too, which might not be good for kids under the age of 8. The impostor tries to kill crewmates and there are guns and knives shown. The good thing is that it is a cartoon and no blood is shown. 

So I'd definatly recommend Among Us. It is fun, intense, and cheap."
9525,"fun game, I like this game among US. every day I play this game."

9541,"This game saved my life.

I am 38.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side."

9557,One of my favorite games for getting my friends together. Not many games that are *good* are cross platform. The low costpoint and option to play for free on mobile makes it easily accessible. Playing with random people is much less fun but with the right people I never laugh so hard

And it turned on and i wasn't thinking about hitting windows and closing out since i just got this laptop and i wasnt really thinking about that, so i just ignored the birth-date sign and just skipped cuz i expected they would let me set it later but instead they set my birth-date to 1 day old...-_- your kidding right now i have to give them my personal information on my card to play a game that i could play easily a year ago unless i wanna play free chat which is horrible as far as i remember...(also i'm hearing that they got rid of people pets and skins and stuff i bought all the packs on this shit so idk if i got a refund or not but i better have if they got rid of my shit.) also i know this was kinda my fault but i shouldn't have to put in my card information cuz i'm 1 day old someone who is one day old cant even play this game like tf lmao. I will prolly delete and make a new review that is positive if this is fixed or if i can find a way to fix it since i dont know if i can just change it but yea this pisses me off and its just stupid."

9849,poep game
9850,Pay'd 5 dollars for this trash and when they update it they make it so you cannot even chat with anyone or change your name. It makes socializing (which is basically a huge part of the game) a HUGE struggle to do. wish I could refund it honestly.

The game Among us is cool, funny with friends, interesting and you should atleast have 2 Hours playing it. It has a good content people there are nice overall 9/10 Game. If u want to try you can i liked it its very interesting to play. If you like to collect achievements its not difficult to collect it. 

My opinion, is that its an amazing game and it doesnt get actually boring. (If u dont like get a refund...) 
Its worth it a try atleast good luck have fun.

(MY OPINION and hopefully yours too)"
9858,This game reminds me of one of those round garbage cans and fire alarms I see everywhere. I wonder if anyone else gets reminded of common everyday objects when playing this.

The other day my teacher was teaching us Greek Mythology and he mentioned a pegasus and I immediately thought 'Pegasus? more like Mega Sus!!!!' and I've never wanted to kms more. I can't look at a vent without breaking down and fuсking crying. I can't eat pasta without thinking 'IMPASTA??? THATS PRETTY SUS!!!!' Skit 4 by Kanye West. The lyrics ruined me. A Mongoose, or the 25th island of greece. The scientific name for pig. I can't fuсking take it anymore.

Please fuсking end my suffering."

10115,"Hello everyone, concerned father here. Recently my 7 year old son discovered the video game “Among Us” after playing it on his computer. While i didn’t mind at first, it soon began to affect his character. Within a week, he had been screaming 'sus’ in his sleep. When asked to do his homework, he called me a stupid father and said ‘kicked’. His grades have been dropping heavily since that day and whenever i refuse to give him my credit card for cosmetics he threatens me saying he’ll “eject” me. Yesterday I entered his room to witness him listening to extremely loud rave 'Among Drip’, he put a bunch of pillows in his shirt to make himself look big and now calls himself a “crewmate”. He refuses to go to bible study unless we use “vent” to get there. I don’t know what that is but he refuses to take any form of transportation except that. Please I am so concerned, what do I do?"
10116,Actually see this stuff in my sleep.
10117,"PLAY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
10118,"wow credit card details because of a joke age? as if ""my 5 month year old child"" would even be allowed and able to have an email also gotta love how they just made that shit up too, oh no gotta be 18 plus for fucking among us all the kids that played it before that restriction are surely gonna not play it now. suuure."

10125,"IT'S FUN
"
10126,amazing
10127,very sus
10128,"This is a very fun multiplayer game. Personally, I think it is more fun with friends rather than public lobbies because you can openly communicate with them better. In addition to that, with private lobbies, you don't have to wait for people to load into your game and a lot of the time they get impatient and leave making you have to wait for others again."

10197,"The steam version of this game is bugged.  When I installed it and opened it up for the first time, it broke and didn't ask me for my birthday.  Because of this, it now thinks I am 1 year old, and no matter how many times I uninstall and reinstall, even putting in my real birthday, it's bugged and creates an account for a 1 year old.  I've tried every fix I could find, nothing works.  The only way to ""verify your age and grant your child permission"" is by giving them your SSN or credit card information, which I do not feel comfortable with.  

I did download the mobile version of the game, and there I was able to create an account properly without all this fuss.  However, the Steam version of the game does not give me any option to log in with or link that account, and forces me into the account it creates for me... for a 1 year old.

I emailed support about this bug and their response was ""you have to verify your child's age through SSN or Credit Card.  Thank you support, I can tell you definitely read my email. /s"

10264,"Despite the cringe this game generated, it is a fun game."
10265,"Ok so, this is a good game, but it has some flaws. First of all the fact that any player can press the emergency meeting button without actually having a reason for it can actually get on your nerves a little bit after a while, and also this game is kinda overridden with memes, to the point of instability. But, overall, solid game, just watch out for hackers/trolls when playing tho."
10266,Good game but too many braindead toddlers for my taste.
10267,"In the 87 hours that it took me to beat Among Us, I was put through an absolute wringer of emotion: Anger as I was beaten down by its toughest challenges, exhilaration when I finally overcame them, and a fair amount of sorrow for the mountains of exp I lost along the way to some of the toughest player encounters Innersloth has ever conceived. But more than anything else I was in near-constant awe – from the many absolutely jaw-dropping vistas, the sheer scope of an absolutely enormous world, the frequently harrowing imposters, and the way in which Among Us nearly always rewarded my curiosity with either an interesting encounter, a valuable reward, or something even greater. Innersloth takes the ball that Roblox’s “Murder Mystery” got rolling and runs with it, creating a fascinating and dense open world about freedom and exploration above all else, while also somehow managing to seamlessly weave a full-on Dark Souls game into the middle of it. It shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone that Among Us ended up as one of the most unforgettable gaming experiences I’ve ever had."

10337,"This game used to be fun, especially with a combination of friends and randoms, but like all things in this degenerate age, it just had to go bad at some point. Let me tell you what made Among Us FUN. You would take a friend or three who would act as co-conspirators, and you'd grab randoms and play the game every way EXCEPT what everybody expected. I'm talking Pikmin 4/Altrive (as he now calls himself) type shenanigans, I'm talking third wheel antics, I'm talking random defector rounds, I'm talking throwing out Black just because he was black, I'm talking random suicide just to shake things (and people) up. And if you're offended by throwing out Black just because he was black, I'M offended by someone being thrown out just because they were ""acting weird"". Nobody knew what to expect (with the odd exception of randoms who caught on and joined in), Facts and Logic™ people and other who take themselves way too seriously were mega trolled, and fun times were had by anybody that WAS somebody. Then, of course, those who were NOT somebody -I'm talking people like the Bodyguard, who apparently had no problems roleplaying as a [i]Nazi[/i] and tossing people overboard just because, yet suddenly suffered Critical Existence Failure when Donald Trump came up- these non-individuals started whining and bitching to the devs on the forums and of course, like Overwatch and a million other contemporary games, they just had to listen to them and make the game anti-fun. Now, you have to make an [i]account[/i] to play this game, which anybody could play for free except here it costs about five quid. Now, users can [i]report[/i] other users ('cause everyone LOVES fucking snitches and that's just what the world needed, amirite?!), and now, of course, as other reviews have pointed out, lobbies with randoms are full of bots and retards who don't even put any effort in. I'm talking people (and bots) who sit in the lobby and advertise their deviant crap instead of, say, getting some fresh closet air. THEN, every single match is interrupted by the ridiculous and completely unnecessary porkin'-beans progression system. When the round is over, I don't want to watch the seedpod equivalent of paint drying, you stupid fucktard, I want to go on to the NEXT round. If I want to watch the bean counters, I'll drive myself down to the local corporate office and watch their bumbling attempts to balance budgets, all [i]without your help[/i]. And the best part of it all? I SPENT five quid on a single DLC back in the day whose content I don't even have access to anymore because they changed everything, including how costumes work. This is a proper mess and I want my five quid back, you racketeers.

10339,"Eh, it's not worth paying for. I'll continue to play but I don't think it's that good."
10340,"I have hundreds of hours in this game across multiple platforms combined and I just gor to say this game is incredibly addictive and fun BUT you need to be playing with others on a discord server or with people you are with. Its a social deduction game so it is meant to be played by communicating with others. If u play the puplic lobbies with no one on call or mic it gets boring and repetitive very fast.
Its not the game itself that makes it fun.
It's the social interaction u have when playing this game that makes it great.
I highly recommend but only if u are using discord or some form of vocal communication via mics otherwise it gets boring fast"
10341,"This game is only fun if you have at least 4 other friends to play it with because of these reasons
1. Impostors are randomly selected so you will constantly have people leaving because they aren't impostors.
2. There are 4 maps in the game but people only really play the 1st one (the skeld) so it gets boring fast.
3. Most of the tasks aren't fun as a crew mate especially on the airship match because they are so far apart from each other and the tasks can be a chore. (fueling engines,start reactor, download data) 
4. People play the game just to flirt or troll other people and ruin the game more then people who actually play the game properly and its full of racists. 
5. Most of the player base lacks intelligence because they just say vote (certain colour) and almost all of the time people listen to them and vote a crew mate off.
2020 among us was good but 2021 and 2022 among us is awful."

10424,"If you accidentally put the wrong birthday (which ends up being under 13 years old), then you have to deal with guardian permissions and a charge on your card. After contacting support I have been told that players are UNABLE to change their information (including birthday). I can now not play with friends as the whole guardian system is absolutely intuitive and as someone who made a simple mistake should not have to deal with this.

The game IS fun, but everything surrounding the game has become so processed that it is no longer [Log In -> Play Game]. Now it is [Log In -> Verify -> Friend -> Approve -> Join] of which I cannot do because I am done with dealing with the guardian restrictions on my account.

10434,"ETA: Would like to rate this game EXTRA terrible! Issues thirty-day bans for ""hacking"" to mod users (for mods that allow no hacking ability but enable ALL players to enjoy extra roles). Don't be an idiot. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY. They'll take it, rook you for more (cosmetic items are $10 per DLC unit, and there's several per year), and then ban you anyway. 

There's no way to play without being targeted, harassed, bullied, and kicked out of your own lobby. 

Again got kicked because people joined my lobby, decided they hated my settings, and called a meeting to kick me.  All they had to do was leave and join a different game or make their own, but no, they abused the game design to just get rid of me instead.  

Devs need to moderate this game and DO something about reported players, and especially give better tools to lobby hosts. Part of running any MMO is also controlling the player community and guaranteeing that the game can in fact BE PLAYED without destructive interference from trolls and jerks taking advantage of a half-built game. 

No one should pay for this gameplay, OR to be treated like this."

And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than ""sus.""

10483,"To be quite honest, this game is very fun at first however the fun almost immediately disappears once you realize most of the players are children on mommies tablet or smart phone. As well, more recent updates have taken away the ability to pick on said children anonymously due to you having to make an account to play. Most games end fairly quickly either due to the ""sussy guy with a knife""  having more then handful of functioning brain-cells, or if you some how are the ""red sussy killer importer"" you get voted off almost immediately with very little proof to it being you. Also the game doesn't have nearly enough breasts which is definitely a negative for me. In conclusion, if you have friends down to play it's definitely worth the five bucks, if not just hold onto your money."

Among Us in real life (sus, sus)
Among Us in real life (sus, sus)
Playing Among Us in real life, spaceship with my crew
Gonna split up, spread out 'cause we all got tasks to do
Gotta find the imposter as they try to sabotage
Who can we trust in this Among Us entourage?
Heard a sound, turned around, looking up, looking down
Then I find a dead body
Gotta blow the horn, emergency discussion, who should we believe?
Can't decide, so, now we leave, not sure what I'm about to see
Will it be a dead body? Still have a task I must complete
Who's the impostеr?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can wе trust?

Looking sus, who can we trust?

Looking sus, who can we trust?
I'm a ghost, I'm my biggest fear, got killed by the imposter
I was playing in the game, but now I'm just a watcher
I'm paying attention using my 360 vision
If it gets quiet, I listen
Make sure there's nothing I'm missing
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?

Looking sus, who can we trust?

Looking sus, who can we trust?

Looking sus, who can we trust?
It wasn't me (or me)
It definitely wasn't me
No one can be trusted because someone is lying
We still have tasks to do, so, let's split up so we can win
Everyone is sus so let this last round begin
There's an imposter among us
Trying to take something from us
We're still over here working
While she's just ghosting above us
Someone's under suspicion
Sabotaging our mission
Doing my task in the kitchen
Until I stop, look, and listen
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?

I'm the I-M-P-O-S-T-E-R, that's me
While everyone's doing tasks, I'm going through vents on a killing spree
Yeah, I'm sus in Among Us
We can discuss whoever took your life
But if you think you're running this game, oh-yeah
That's me holding this knife
I'm the imposter

you can customize crewmates/impostors to roam around the map killing/doing tasks to win against aothers

crewmates can win by ejecting the impostor
the impostor/s can win by killing all the crewmates/voting them out and pulling a sabotage"
10548,"its is the best game in the world
"
10549,"Pray the game doesn't misreport your entered DoB to the server.  You will lose chat, InnerSloth will refuse to fix it on their end, and reinstalling the game (even with clearing registry and InnerSloth AppData folder) won't help; developers will instead demand that you hand over your credit card and/or social security number to an unheard-of third party website.

Starting to sound mighty scammy."
10550,"This game is terrible.
I bought it for money and there were no advantages to getting it free on a mobile device.
Also, you cannot chat or do what you want as you need a parental email and other stuff.

10551,verry good
10552,"Game was fun- great interaction and made some awesome friends from it, especially if you were to incorporate discord which makes it infinitely easier to communicate at the end of each session.  However, was slowly drawn away due to the experience changing as there was no more discussions- just screaming.  I had fun- maybe it's changed, but friends moved on to other games, and playing with friends is what made the game great."

10555,"Among us is a great murder mystery type game with many unique features, You are either an Imposter or a Crewmate and depending on your role is what you do in the game. The imposters role is to kill all the crewmates to win and the crewmates job is to find out who the imposter is and vote them off. Overall great game, Would recommend."

10561,"I only enjoyed playing this game with friends(which was not easy to set up). My only problem when It came to playing with randoms, was people leaving during the game. So that really ruined most of my among us experience, but If you have enough friends to get the real experience out of this game, then I would recommend It, but only then."
10562,"""Personally, with my very few hours on this game, I believe that this game known as ""Among Us""  is a work of art, not only with the many HILARIOUS jokes that have come with it, but also the sheer factor of it's magnitude and overall design, simply showing that less is more with the characters simplistic design. The gameplay itself could have a documentary made on it with how advanced and groundbreaking it truly is, and I believe that everyone should but it"" - Stephen Hawking, 2019"

10621,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but at least I can give you strawberry cheese cake recipe.

ingredients:

250g digestive biscuits
100g butter, melted
1 vanilla pod
600g full fat soft cheese
100g icing sugar
284ml pot of double cream
For the topping
400g punnet of strawberries, halved
25g icing sugar

STEP 1
To make the base, butter and line a 23cm loose-bottomed tin with baking parchment. Put the digestive biscuits in a plastic food bag and crush to crumbs using a rolling pin. Transfer the crumbs to a bowl, then pour over the melted butter. Mix thoroughly until the crumbs are completely coated. Tip them into the prepared tin and press firmly down into the base to create an even layer. Chill in the fridge for 1 hr to set firmly.

STEP 2
Slice the vanilla pod in half lengthways, leaving the tip intact, so that the two halves are still joined. Holding onto the tip of the pod, scrape out the seeds using the back of a kitchen knife.

STEP 3
Pour the double cream into a bowl and whisk with an electric mixer until it’s just starting to thicken to soft peaks. Place the soft cheese, icing sugar and the vanilla seeds in a separate bowl, then beat for 2 mins with an electric mixer until smooth and starting to thicken, it will get thin and then start to thicken again. Tip in the double cream and fold it into the soft cheese mix. You’re looking for it to be thickened enough to hold its shape when you tip a spoon of it upside down. If it’s not thick enough, continue to whisk. Spoon onto the biscuit base, starting from the edges and working inwards, making sure that there are no air bubbles. Smooth the top of the cheesecake down with the back of a dessert spoon or spatula. Leave to set in the fridge overnight.

STEP 4
Bring the cheesecake to room temperature about 30 mins before serving. To remove it from the tin, place the base on top of a can, then gradually pull the sides of the tin down. Slip the cake onto a serving plate, removing the lining paper and base. Purée half the strawberries in a blender or food processor with the icing sugar and 1 tsp water, then sieve. Pile the remaining strawberries onto the cake, and pour the purée over the top.

voilà!"

10639,Among us is a nice little game. Great way to kill some time and sharpen up your lying and manipulation skills. My only issue is the game has no real moderation there’s a lot of horny kids and weird 40 year old men on the game

The other day my teacher was teaching us Greek Mythology and he mentioned a pegasus and I immediately thought 'Pegasus? more like Mega Sus!!!!' and I've never wanted to kms more. I can't look at a vent without breaking down and fucking crying. I can't eat pasta without thinking 'IMPASTA??? THATS PRETTY SUS!!!!' Skit 4 by Kanye West. The lyrics ruined me. A Mongoose, or the 25th island of greece. The scientific name for pig. I can't fucking take it anymore.

Its like Among Us force-opened my third eye with their beautiful floating hands. Among Us has completely changed my perspective on not only games, but on life. I don't see games as fun experiences anymore, I see them as fantastic misunderstood art pieces.

Among Us is the only game I play at the moment as no other game quite like it. Among Us is love, Among Us is life, Among Us is us."

Perhaps do you need also the details of my toilet paper???
Nevermind, I will just pring out your verification E-Mail and wipe my a** with it.

OH and why does it not automatically LOG IN through Steam and waste my time.

I just bought it because my friends told me so, because they needed one more person.
But this is more than fu***** enragious.

Pardon my language. I hope you get my fu***** point.

PS: I can play Hentai Games but not Amogus, seems like they think I am some kid and need to send a E-Mail to my Guardians.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

I showed my Champion underwear to my girlfriend, and the logo I flipped it, and I said, ""Hey babe, when the underwear sus?"" I fucking looked at a trashcan, I said, ""That's a bit sussy."" I look at my penis, I think of the astronaut's helmet, and I go, ""Penis? More like peen-sus!"" AHHHHHHHHH-"

It's a nice cheap little game that is still being updated to this day. Definitely worth it for friend groups wanting to mix up a game night! PS. It's cross-platform!

11063,"This games really fun aside from all the memes, and jokes about it. It's really addicting, and a good getaway game for people who are easily bored."
11064,"It's fun when played with the right guys. The game isn't anything groundbreaking nor should you expect anything crazy before buying. You have multiple free cosmetics to customize your character at will and a few maps to play off of. Overall, definitely a game worth trying."

11070,"Among Us is not an originally game. This idea has probably been done 100s of times before, often with small twists. To name a few in no particular order: TTT, Murder, Town of Salem, Deceit, Mafia, and Werewolf. All of these and many, many, more are the same game at their core. Among Us is not special or unique. It’s not even the cheapest. Its just the version that got the most mainstream appeal, so all your friends probably already have it and in the case that they don’t, they can pick it up for cheap on Steam or get the phone version for free. It will run on pretty much anything and it has cross play.

Since I’m writing a review anyway, I’ve got to call out the friend’s system. It’s horrible. Everyone is given a randomly chosen friend name. When trying to invite friends to games, you see this friend name, not their display name. There’s no way I’m remembering everyone’s friend name, making this system utterly useless. The old invite code system is still in the game and infinitely easier to use.

11087,"Met some great people on this game. Very fun! Can get repetitive, but the updates are fun and seem to work properly. Haven't had any trouble other than a DC every now and then."
11088,"Too ez, I always win... I need a real challenging game, like 'Mario Teaches Typing 2' to feel anything at all. Amogus however is the most disappointing game EVER. I play as Amogus sussy and always get da pussy (get it?) and when I play as Amogus not sussy I always know who the sussy baka is. No one believes me of course... Filthy commoners, all of them. When I look at Amogus I feel ashamed knowing that I'll always be intellectually superior to anyone I'm up against, since they are all children (2-4 years old) and who could ever be proud of win against a child? (rhetorical question, don't answer) Compared to such a masterpiece as 'Mario Teaches Typing 2' this game is nothing but a spec of dust in the eye of a giant towering over your child like form, while you cower in fear, knowing what's to come... I as an avid enjoyer of challenging games, like the aforementioned 'Mario Teaches Typing 2' and other titles in the franchise am very disappointed in the product, that I received. Can you imagine being Amogus sussy and not even being able to get da pussy? (Me neither) That is why I find this game to be immature and not ready to go public. The last time I played this game was about 20 minutes ago and I still feel a lingering sense of dread, knowing that the almighty lord in heaven will smite me down for the sins I have committed. Therefore I say to you Amogus enjoyers, repent before 'tis too late and your soul might still be saved!! Go play Mario Teaches Typing 2, now on PS5 and Xbox series X/S"

11109,"This game is pretty good, but not quite as good as Cinnamon Pull Apart Bread!

What you'll need:

- A 9x13 Pan (preferably glass)
- Non Stick Spray
- 2 Tubes of Biscuits (Pillsbury or Otherwise)
- 1 and 1/2 sticks of Salted Butter (Unsalted also works, just be sure to add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt in step 3)
- 4 Teaspoons of Brown Sugar
- 1 Teaspoon of Cinnamon
- 1 Tablespoon of Honey
- 2 Tablespoons of Milk, Heavy Cream, or Buttermilk (Non-Dairy Milks work as well. See Step for more info) (More as Needed)
- 2 Cups of Powdered Sugar (more as needed)

Step 1. Preheat your oven to 350 and give your pan a light coat of non-stick spray

Step 2. POP THEM BISCUITS OPEN BABY!!

Once you get the biscuits out, grab a butterknife (or use your hands you filthy animal) and quarter them. Start laying em out in the pan. Spaces in-between the biscuits is A-okay cause we want that buttersugar to get down in there once we start pouring. Likely, you'll run into the issue of ""too many biscuit pieces, not enough space"" so just kinda squish em down and try to fill in the edges and corners with an extra biscuit piece. Once you've got all the biscuits packed in there, we're on to step 3!

Step 3. BUTTERSUGAR TIME

Grab your 1 and 1/2 Sticks of butter and we're gon' melt that son of a gun. Personally, I like to melt butter in the microwave, but if you wanna get all fancy and pull out the saucepan then go for it. Ain't nobody stopping you.

So for the rest of us common folk, put your butter in a microwave safe bowl or Pyrex measuring cup. I throw it in there for like 1min and just check on it closer to the minute mark, but we all got different microwaves. Basically, you just want the butter to be melted with no chunks left in it. So however long it takes to do that. DON'T leave it in too long or it'll burn and then you gotta go get more butter.

NOW. You've got your melted butter. Add the Cinnamon and the brown sugar to it and stir the everliving life outta that thing til' it's all nice and pretty. Once you've successfully crafted the buttersugar, pour it over the biscuits in the pan. My two main goals here are ""1. Make sure every biscuit gets some love"" and ""2. Fill in all the cracks"" So pour slow and steady.

Step 4. MAKE IT HOT

Okay. Let me level with you here. I am not a classically trained baking professional. I'm just a regular schmegular person who likes the sweety sweets. I have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ these up before and this is the step that made my spouse leave.

Double check the oven is on 350. Put the little biscuits in the oven so that they can grow up to be big and strong. Leave them in there for about 10-13min. Be sure to check on your biscuits throughout the process. What you're looking for is the tops to be golden brown. Like that real fresh baked brown, that you see in the movies and tv and recipe sites. Once you see golden brown, open the oven and don't be afraid to get a little greedy. Grab a biscuit off the top so you can see how the middle section and bottom of the pan look.

If it looks doughy Turn the oven off and let the biscuits sit inside for maybe 5 minutes. Again, note the color of the tops and go back to your reference piece that you took out. You want them to look like done biscuits. I can't put pictures but I'll make a guide if people are interested and go back through all the steps with pictures.

If it doesn't look doughy Well then what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing? Move on to the next step champ! We got biscuits to eat!

Step 5. Make the Glaze

In a good sized bowl, whisk together your Powdered sugar, honey, and milk. If you don't have a whisk, that's fine. Just go grab a utensil or something. Personal preference: Fork. They look meaner than the other utensils.

NON-DAIRY MILK USERS UNITE!
I really like an almond milk substitute here, but whatever works, works. Just know, with the amount of ingredients we're using here, your glaze may come out thin and runny. If it does, don't panic and cry. Just add a little more powdered sugar in tablespoon increments. Add, whisk and repeat if it still comes out runny. Once it's thick enough, go ahead on.

Take your whisked mixture and and drizzle it over the finished biscuits. And boom done. You just baked something delicious.

If you read this far, thank you. If you liked the recipe, thank you. I'll try to make a guide and go back through with pictures and gifs to make this a lot easier to follow if enough people want that.

Call the ones you love, tell em you love them."

It gets even more astounding when you start considering the fact the bulk of Reds committing these murders are probably ages 8-18 which is probably around an estimated 6-7% of the population that means that around 7% of Among Us Players are committing around 50% of the murders. This is not all too dissimilar to a corresponding problem within the American society.

11197,"אמונג אס הוא אכן כן משחק מעניין בעל רב של  דרכים לשחק באמונג אס

לשנות את הצורה שלו לשחקני הקבוצה בכל הקבוצה ובכך לתת אתגר ולאנשים הרגילים ""imposer"" לדוגמא תוכל לתת לרצוח או בשפה הלועזית  

בכך תוכלו למצוא את הגופות שנהרגו במהלך המשחק ""scientist""ובכך תוכל גם לתת לאנשי האומנג אס את אופציה לראות מי מת או מי חי ולבוחר הזה קוראים 

כאשר האחד מאנשי האמונג אס הראשונים מתים הם מקבלים את האופציה לתת לאנשי האמונג אס מגן שמגן אליהם מלמות על ידי הרוצח
 ""Guardian angel""עוד דרך להביא היתרון לאנשי האמנוג אס שהם לא רוצחים זה דמות הנקראת 

יש גם את המושחניק והוא מקבל את האוצפיה לעבור בין תעלות אוויר בכל אזור המפה ובכך יכול לעבור ביעילות בכל המפה דבר שמהווה היתרון

אך כמוון שיש מבחר נחמד של מפות שאפשר לבחור

כעת יש הרבעה מפות במשחק וכל אחד מהמפות מהוות מישמות שונות ודרכים חדשים לשחק עם חבריה למשחק 

הקמות המקסימלית לחדר אחד של משחק היא 15 אנשים כאשר יש 15 אנשים יש 3 רוצחים
אך כמובן היוצר של החדר יכול לבחור את כמות הרוצים 

אך לפעמיים מומלץ לשים רוצח אחד שיש 9 אנשים
לשים שני רוצחים שיש 10 אנשים ומעלה
ולשים שלושה רוצחים שיש 15 אנשים ומעלה 

וכמווון אפשר גם לשנות את הגדרות המשק בכללי 
כגון כמות מישומות , האם אפשר לראות מישומות ועוד

אך מומלץ לשים את הגדרות המשחק על פי מה שרוב הקהל בוחר או במילים אחרות מה שחבריו לשמחק ממליצים

ולבסוף ברור שאפשר להצב את הדמות שלך במשחק אבל לפני שמתחילים ולא אחרי כי כאשר אתה באמצה המשחק אין לך את האופציה לצאת ממנו 

לבסוף אני ממליץ לכם לשחק במשחק הנלפא אמונג אס 
משחק מדהים במחיר מאוד זול שהוא מתחת ל18 שקל"

This game is all about deception and survival whether its in the spaceship, office building, or an alien world to do some tasks. One of your friends or YOU could be the impostor and start killing off one by one to end the game. It has a simple design but the best part of all is that it's a very fun game to mess around with your friends. 10/10"

Using mods for it is a lot of fun, but even on its own, it stands alone pretty well.  It's a simple game that you can kill some time with.  If you're into the multi-player games and don't want to commit to long RPGs or you like sleuthing, give it a try."

11297,"As enjoyable with friends as playing Chopsticks or Rock Paper Scissors; fun the first couple of times but ultimately a bore. There are, admittedly, some quite amazing moments that have resulted from this game, such as my friend and I joining a game, me immediately slamming the button to call a meeting, and then me saying ""orange (friend) is sus"" which resulted in him being voted out. He was imposter.

In general, I would not recommend it as a game to play with friends; there are others that can be much more enjoyable. Town of Salem, for instance, is Among Us if you wanted to actually take it seriously. Or there is Jackbox, if you want to actually be humorous. What I'm saying is this game is okay but there are better."

11354,"Sussus Amogus was born in 371 A.D. in Rome. After his father died at 375 A.D. He became the first child emperor of Europe but since he was a child it meant a lot of opportunities for the people who want power for themselves so on the night of May 15th 392 A.D. very corrupt people have gone to his palace and tricked him into eating poisoned food. This did not please the power-hungry people so they stabbed him multiple times to the point that he will no longer be brought back to life.

Fine I'll write an actual review. This was a fun game when it first came out and the title screen reminded me of old style holographic Japanese Pokemon cards. The game exploded in popularity but unfortunately lacked the infrastructure to accommodate it. Balance changes were made which were a huge improvement and made it more difficult to find the impostor, but it may have been too little too late. I tried playing with my friends and we were constantly kicked from lobbies for no reason; finally got into a game and it was full of angry, toxic players. One of my friends grew to hate the game because she was constantly voted out for being too smart and making too much sense.

This game is actually better than Town of Salem and Throne of Lies and the fact that I went into some kind of sleep deprived stupor all night to max out the outfit cubes or whatever speaks to its addictive factor. But with how popular the game is, I'm not really writing this review for anyone other than myself or my friends."

I waited hours on end to get impostor to be ratted out by your dim witted team-mate 5 mins later. If I ever play this game again, I want to be a solo impostor. Team-mates let me down like in every single game I ever play. I also don't want children under the age of 8 playing this truly grusome game. The sheer amount of violence and gore in this game is disgusting and frankly horrible to watch from my own, mature, grown-up mind. Please reduce the violence, and amount of imbissil team-mates. This could possibly be the worst 30 hours of gaming experience I've ever had. Thanks for your time and appreciation, but don't play this game. It is an emotional dump and depression for £3."
11391,A really good game

A bit buggy though, but not so buggy that it ruins the fun.

Worth the money, the memes not so much xD"

11478,Over hyped Cringe
11479,"A simply exquisite piece, Among Us is truly a pastime for Ivy-League graduates and Chinese prodigies alike. With truly immersive and captivating gameplay, Among Us can be heard being played and discussed deep within the halls of Harvard. As Albert Einstein once said, “E=mc2, and Among Us = Sussy Imposter”. To quote Aristotle and Plato “Bro Plato I just saw you vent bro, I’m boutta call an emergency meeting”. Among Us is an intellectuals game that has been played by philosophers, geniuses, kings, emperors, and aliens alike since the dawn of man, and will continue to be played until the end of man. I applaud you Innersloth, you really outdid yourselves."

11497,"I don't know if I should recommend this game or not, so I'll just say ""no"". My reasons are that people do not play the game as intended. It is filled with trolls, cheaters and other people that ruin the whole integrity of the game. It is sad and awful. If you really want to enjoy the game as it should be, you can't do it unless you have friends. So, people like me have no chance to do so.
I would like to enjoy the game as it was intended. Mistery, investigation, deceit, trust and betrayal. That is the real Among Us; not the garbage I see today."
11498,"OH MY GOSH, AMONG US IS NOW EVERYWHERE! WHAT U'VE DONE WITH US?"

11512,e
11513,fun party game
11514,AMOGUS!
11515,"devs ruined this game with excessive cosmetics that can hide your color, and it's impossible to find a lobby that isn't horny MHA roleplayers. if you want to hop into a private game with your friends on discord, maybe, but even then I would just recommend VRChat's among us world. it's free, and it has integrated proximity chat. I cannot recommend buying this game in its current state."

11563,throughout a lot of my life I thought this game was shit however yesterday I had a life changing experience with my friends and the game was actually okay so I think its good now
11564,Most of my time playing this was waiting in the main menu for the game to load 10/10
11565,it sucks it just makes you rage when some idiot fucking has a friend and they are like ''YOU KILLED MY FRIEND DUMBASS'
11566,I have to play as a guest because the game wont let me log in to my account and this means I cant use the chat so basically can't play the game properly
11567,great game 10/10 would play again
11568,can we get rank system???? it will be awsome!!!!!!

Among us in real life (sus, sus)
Among us in real life (sus, sus)

Playing among us in real life
Spaceship with my crew
Gonna split up spread out
'Cause we all got tasks to do
Gotta find the imposter
As they try to sabotage
Who can we trust in this among us entourage?

Heard a sound, turned around
Looking up, looking down
Then I find a dead body
Gotta blow the horn emergency
Discussion who should we believe
Can't decide so now we leave
Not sure what I'm about to see
Will it be a dead body
Still have a task I must complete
[All]
Who's the impostеr?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can wе trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?

[Maddie]
I'm a ghost, I'm my biggest fear
Got killed by the imposter
I was playing in the game
But now I'm just a watcher
I'm paying attention using my 360 vision
If it gets quiet I listen
Make sure there's nothing I'm missing

[All]
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
[Rebecca]
It wasn't me

[Matt]
Or me

[Zoey]
It definitely wasn't me
No one can be trusted because someone is lying

[Matt]
We still have tasks to do so let's split up so we can win

[Rebecca]
Everyone is sus so let this last round begin

[Zoey]
There's an imposter among us
Trying to take something from us
We're still over here working
While she's just ghosting above us
Someone's under suspicion
Sabotaging our mission
Doing my task in the kitchen
Until I stop look and listen
[All]
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?

Looking sus, who can we trust?

[Matt]
I'm the i-m-p-o-s-t-e-r
That's me
While everyone's doing tasks
I'm going through vents on a killing spree
Yea, I'm sus in among us
We can discuss whoever took your life
But if you think you're running this game, oh yeah
That's me holding this knife

[All, Matt]
I'm the imposter
Looking sus, who can we trust?
I'm the imposter
Looking sus, who can we trust?
I'm the imposter
Looking sus, who can we trust?

11571,Hopefully the VR version is pretty well optimised cause a game like this could only be fun in VR. Regular game was pretty trash tbh.

11573,"I bought it a while ago, I have 30 hours on it now, and somehow from last year to now you have made it WORSE, HOW? HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO MAKE A BAD GAME, MORE BAD? I'm not sure how I racked up 30 hours on this abismal piece of trash. Maybe from playing with my friend and bullying kids? That wasn't even fun. How do you make bullying 9yos unfun? -10/10, you would find more enjoyment out of putting glass shards into your own rectum and pulling them back out."

11587,"I played the game, I liked it. I liked it so much. So, so much. I loved it so much that I played it for days straight. No eating, no drinking, no sleeping, nothing. It came to the point where I had played so much that when I left my computer/phone I thought I was still in the game. One time I asked my dad what he was doing and he said he had some tasks to do for work. I pulled out a knife and killed him on the spot. When my mom came and saw  his dead body she reported it by calling the police. When the police arrived I told them she self reported. They didnt belive me because they found a bloody knife in my back pocket. I didnt know that was possible in the game. They brought me to this map called the police station which I had never played on before and when I tried to leave my cell to enter a new game it was locked. YOU CANT EXIT THE GAME. Honestly if your looking for a fun game that you can keep playing all day, this is not it."

I Bought This On Steam, Hoping To Escape From The Not-So-Quick Chat, Only To Find That I Can't Even Play The Damned Thing. Way To Kill Your Game, Innersloth.

11607,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

[list]
	[*]   [b] Game Name: [/b] Among Us
	[*]   [b] Game Release: [/b] 2018
	[*]   [b] Genre Tags: [/b] Action, Survival, Psychological, Multiplayer, Indie
	[*]   [b] Estimated Playtime: [/b] 25-50+ Hours
	[*]   [b] Personal Rating: [/b] 7/10
[/list]

[h1] Review [/h1]
[b] Summary - [/b] Among Us is a 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American game studio Innersloth. The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing.

[b] Gameplay - [/b] Gameplay in Among us feels really unique and a game I never played before. Basically you can have 15 players and 3 players can be the “Imposter”. It is your job to kill all of the crewmates before being caught. If you are a crewmate, your goal is to figure out who the imposter is. It's a simple game premise, but really fun to play.

[b] Graphics - [/b] The graphics are very simple. A 2D art style that is really good looking actually for what it is. This game is on mobile as well so you can crossplay with mobile players.

[b] Multiplayer - [/b] This game is only multiplayer, and it's amazing. It’s super easy to make lobbies and you can customize your cremate as well, which is a nice touch. 

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
	[*] Fun gameplay
	[*] Great to play with friends
	[*] Crossplay with mobile players
	[*] Can be addicting at times
	[*] Super cheap
[/list]

[h1] Cons: [/h1]

	[*] Not many maps
	[*] No voice chat

11759,"[h1] To enjoy it: play with a huge friendgroup , set various rules/ take advantage of the server settings and use PROXIMITY CHAT or TheOtherRoles mod[/h1]

Been a long time since I started playing this game (2019), and since then the settings have changed a bit. Apps such as ’Crew Link’ have been there for quite some time and provides a better experience. ’The Other Roles’ is a new mod that allows users to have a huge variety of roles which makes the game more challenging and fun. I tried it out the other day and it’s the best mod for Among Us yet.
This is obv, but playing it with a bunch of friends is much more fun than entering a server where foulmouthed kids believe they're gods of deceit."

11827,"This game is more fun playing with friends than it is doing random lobbies.

Playing with friends allows you to have total chaos and ridiculousness when you chat during meetings, whereas in rando lobbies the convos are kept pretty short and simple.

There is toxicity here, but it's to be expected, as kids and teens alike are all over this game.

Its a good game, I would preferably play with friends. Price is worth it too, so get it asap if you want it."

11879,"this game is very sussy, i like, 10/10"
11880,"Hello all. Concerned father here. Please heed my warnings, and DO NOT play this game. I got this game for my son, Jorvis. Since starting to play this game, he has begun having day terrors about the ""impostor"". He'll frequently have severe paranoia that he might be ""backstabbed"", ""voted out"", or he won't ""finish his tasks"". He even has hallucinations that me or my wife are ""venting"". Currently we have him on strong sedatives, but they have done nothing so far. At one point I tried uninstalling this game from his iPad, but his eyes rolled back into his head, he started levitating, and he bellowed demonic chants while calling me ""sus"". Send help."

11883,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Edit: It's fucking terrible. In hindsight it's childish and repetitive and just bad."

The online multiplayer is mostly smooth and you can have some really good games while weeding out the impostor or being the impostor and murdering everyone. However, this game REALLY shines with friends. Playing with friends is where you find the unsettling and ""whodunnit"" atmosphere that this game is so good at showcasing.

11976,"Dear Innersloth,
Great job on the character design, as the characters get me bricked up each time. It takes a lot to stop me from jerking off, but I contain myself. I would like to see a cumming role in the future for the crewmates.

Best Regards,
Burrito."
11977,Big brain game
11978,i saw this on friday night funkin so i bought it i was disapointed because there was no girlfriend or player from among us logic 0/10 game
11979,E
11980,Why does this game still exist?
11981,actin sus
11982,"amogussss
"
11983,"it gets boring very fast
"
11984,"There's an infinite ocean of numbers between 1 and 2. An uncountable eternity of decimals so similar it would take a thousand lifetimes to discern a single difference. An endless maze of digits so divergent you'd lose hope of ever seeing a whole number again. And yet with the addition of a single number, even amongst all those impossible infinites, 1 will turn to 2. 

And with a single decision... 2 becomes 1."
11985,"like the game, hate the memes."
11986,"If you can get a group of about 6 or more, then then game can be fun and tense. Less than that and it's not worth it."
11987,v
11988,very good for getting revenge on your friends
11989,amogus
11990,Good sussy game
11991,FUN GAME
11992,I hate what this game has done to my generation.
11993,"This game was good when to much shit wasn't added and people played the game without thinking its a joke. This game got big when i was in grade 7 it was all the rage but I remember leaving this game (and everyone else) because they didn't add anything to the game for so long. This game just became a joke and a retarded mess to play. And with the new updates there's to much shit and garbage not fixing the games real problems ""no penalty for leaving if not getting imposter"" ect. Its filled with stupid 10 year old's, hackers and retards. And people still play the game as a joke HOW, THE AMONG US MEMES WERE NEVER FUNNY. Voting out random people because red sus HAHAHAHHA this has been an issue for years any way though. I'm going to finish this review off by saying this ""DLC and other stuff (that you may have payed for) doesn't work, stupid 10 year old's in every game and its so repetitive and stupid to play. This game was a fad!"
11994,"if u ever see lightdotz in ur lobby, hes the imposter vote him out"
11995,When the crewmate is sus.
11996,"hmmmmmmmmmm.


























among."
11997,"Fresh out of college, Barry the Bee finds the prospect of working with honey uninspiring. He flies outside the hive for the first time and talks to a human, breaking a cardinal rule of his species. Barry learns that humans have been stealing and eating honey for centuries, and he realizes that his true calling is to obtain justice for his kind by suing humanity for theft."

11999,SUSUSUSUSUSUSUSUSUSUSUSUSUSUSUSUSUSUS
12000,its fun enough
12001,Good party game recommend it
12002, 1
12003,yes
12004,"It's a meme for a reason. Hate it if you want, but it's a fun game. If you've ever played Mafia or any variant of the werewolf card game, you will quickly understand what's going on with Among Us. Everyone is trying to vote out a secret impostor, while the impostor is trying to last until the end by fitting in while secretly taking other players out of the game one by one. 

Mafia was created in 1986, and since then, there's a few issues that other games have tried to fix. 1) What can you do if you don't feel comfortable voting someone out of the game 2) What do you do after you're voted out? Among Us adds a few new twists to this game variant  by giving the players tasks to do so that they can win without finding the impostor. And if you stick around, you can help your team win even after death by finishing up your task.

This game, like Mafia or Werewolf, is really hit or miss depending on the group you're playing with. A few bad eggs ruins the whole thing, but that's the nature of the social deduction game I think, so I won't knock Among Us for that. Pick it up for cheap and find yourself a good crew to travel through space with."

12009,"Accidentally put in a wrong age that was too young and now I literally cannot play without giving a social security number or some other highly invasive means of proving my identity which shouldn't happen when playing a children's game in a private lobby with my friends but there's literally nothing else I can do unless I fork over that highly personal information.  Guess I'll never play again.

My advice: be careful not to mess up your birthday information otherwise you're screwed and cannot play.  (Yes I have tried every search engine method to fix this and reset the birthday, but none of them worked)."

12054,"Oh. My. Fucking. God. I have been searching for a game exactly like this for years. I scoured the internet for a source of entertainment that is even comparable to this masterpiece for eons. I had vivid dreams of playing a who-dunnit, social deduction game that was of this fashionable appearance and style 18 hours a day. I physically cannot stop myself from playing this game. I have tried many times to remove myself from my gaming chair, but it is no use. My life is here. In among us. I want nothing else, but to be ejected from a spaceship when i die and have the bloopy bloopy type writer noise inscribe on the screen, ""scoot has been ejected."" To who ever created this game: I worship you and I always have. I just did not know it yet."

In all seriousness, among us is still worth playing even after the whole craze has died down apart from the memes which have begun to do so as well. If you like games like Mafia (a school/party game) or Town of Salem (pretty similar to Mafia), you'll probably like the susser."

12081,"Do you like anonymity in a game? What about ability to manipulate and gaslight real life players? Maybe you even like a splash of murder with the only consequence being ejected out of a fake spaceship in a video game? Then this is the game for you! Ramp it up to even more excitement by adding a second imposter, a partner in crime, if you will. 
Or maybe you like solving mysteries? You want to beat up the big bad, and love giving moving speeches? This game can be a great platform to have fun and shine your skills. 
Do you like to get together with your friends and debate the imposter? Yeah, keep that kind of game private, ain't nobody except y'all tryna do that kind of thing. This is a game to have fun, and kill your fellow spacemates, not argue on who was in what room because you monitored every single detail instead of doing your tasks.

Anyways 10/10 will play again and again."

It gets even more astounding when you start considering the fact the bulk of Reds committing these murders are probably ages 8-18 which is probably around an estimated 6-7% of the population that means that around 7% of Among Us Players are committing around 50% of the murders."

All you have to learn are the maps, and then master lying, deceptiveness, and how to be a troll.

This game, and its popularity, are a sure sign of what is wrong with the world today.
Be rewarded for being an untrustworthy, deceitful worm

(or so it seems to be catering to a child demographic) but still its entirely disgusting and I refuse to play a dead game full of horny kids and disgraceful pedophiles... there are so many better games to invest your time into  rather than spending $4.99 USD just to be leaving and joining random lobbies trying to find one thats actual players and not horny men and children/teens trying to get a rise off of others and lure in kids/other kids/adults into their social media presence with malicious intent. the game at this point should either just go free or entirely shutdown the servers and have a new system implemented to remove anyone/ban anyone who use keyterms that cater to sexual activity and remove individual lobbies that have been sitting in the hub waiting for others for more than 10-15 minutes.. just a personal though though so please don't discriminate  but it had to be said..."

It used to be that you could type whatever you wanted and mess with your friends or other players, and it was a great party game. I used to make my character look like another person and copied their name only with a slight difference when I was the killer. This would make it so the wrong person would sometimes get ejected. Most of the fun of this game is playing with friends and messing with them, but now, with that gone, I can no longer recommend this game and will keep it uninstalled until they remove the paid cosmetics and add back the feature to type freely. I understand the devs need to make money, so maybe add bonus maps or something instead not based on appearance."

12375,"Fun and addictive little game. And, at $5.00, you can't go wrong. I've already put over 60 hours into this game, across 3 platforms. 

You're on a spaceship as either a humanoid or an impostor humanoid. Your goal is to find out who the impostors are and vote them off into space. You communicate with your other crewmates with text messages to figure out who the impostors are. If you're a humanoid, you task to keep the spaceship up and running. If you're the impostors, you sabotage the spaceship and try to kill off as many crewmates as you can. When you die, you become a ghost, but can still task or sabotage. This game is the most fun you'll have without whips and chains. 

Also, I can tell you that this game is EXTREMELY buggy on the Xbox and Switch, but on Steam, it plays like a dream. If you're on-the-fence about which platform to buy this game on, I'd say buy it on Steam to get a stable copy of the game."

12429,"How to Cut a Jalapeno

The spice in jalapeños is found in the seeds and inner membranes.  To reduce the heat in this recipe, clean out all of the (light colored) inner membrane and seeds. If you like lots of heat, leave a little bit of membrane.

When I cut the jalapeños for poppers, I cut them lengthwise and try to keep the stem intact on both halves (mainly for appearance).

To cut jalapenos to make jalapeno poppers:

Put on gloves!!
Slice jalapenos in half lengthwise.
Using a small spoon, scoop out seeds and membranes and discard.
Raw ingredients for Jalapeno Poppers
 How to Make Jalapeno Poppers
Jalapeno Poppers have a few essentials; the jalapeno itself, a creamy filling and breading.

How Long to Bake Jalapeno Poppers
I bake these poppers about 20 minutes, enough to soften the peppers and melt the cheese. You don’t want them too soft or they’re hard to pick up and eat!

Once baked, serve these alongside some cool ranch or blue cheese dressing.

Jalapeno Poppers topped with chives
Jalapeno Poppers can be made a couple of days in advance or even prepared well ahead of time and frozen. Cook right from frozen about 25-30 minutes at 425°F.


 PREP TIME - 20 minutes
COOK TIME- 25 minutes
TOTAL TIME - 45 minutes
12 servings
These easy jalapeno poppers are a game day favorite! Jalapenos are stuffed with a cheesy filling, topped with a buttery bread crumb topping and baked until golden.

Ingredients
▢12 jalapeno peppers
▢6 ounces cream cheese softened
▢1 teaspoon garlic powder
▢4 ounces sharp cheddar shredded
▢2 tablespoons chives finely chopped
▢¼ cup Panko bread crumbs
▢1 tablespoon butter melted

Instructions
Preheat the oven to 400°F.
Wearing gloves, slice the jalapenos in half lengthwise. Using a small spoon, scoop out the seeds and membranes.
In a bowl mix cream cheese, garlic powder, cheddar cheese and chives (if using).
In a separate bowl, combine Panko crumbs and melted butter.
Fill jalapenos with the cheese mixture. Top with crumbs.
Place on a baking pan and bake 18-22 minutes or until golden.
Cool 5-10 minutes before serving."

12574,"I enjoy these sorts of games. If you are searching for thing to make with the allies, among us is for you. The murder mystery game where one person on the ship is an unknown in hiding, attempting to destroy the other team mates. The team must work easy and cold puzzles to take the ship back in working order. While responding to this “ imposters ” sabotages. And attempting not to turn into this imposters next meal. If the substance is seen or a participant is wary of somebody they will initiate the meeting. (that is where a lot of This play takes place) . They can speak and take on the person they believe the killer is. (PS if you need to email meetings or move out the voting clock or be toxic as a summary you can normally be kicked ). If the team is correctly they succeed. If their wrong the play keeps going until just the imposter and one other unfortunate individual continue. You may even do tasks as a ghost and will get thru that to see the entire play unfold. It’s very dynamic in this time (you can come in the sever almost immediately) . Download Among Us on PC and Macintosh to go to the depths of outside place to stay on the space station. Time on the space place is busy. The whole team has a particular set of tasks and missions to accomplish in order to end their time. Alas, nowadays is not like any other time. Among these regular and colorful team members lies the imposter looking to destroy the rest of the team. Go Among Us on Mac and PC with BlueStacks to take this character of either team member or impostor. Team members can get made jobs that must be completed before they are all murdered. The imposter has the power to sabotage these jobs and slip through vents to different areas or to be invisible. Each strategy may be tailored by the player that made to make it more exciting, challenging, or comfortable for one line or the other. Go Among Us on PC and Macintosh with BlueStacks to see the outside space imposter hellbent on murder."

12685,"In August, Innersloth opened an online store for Among Us themed merchandise. The game's popularity inspired many original songs, fanarts and internet memes, Willard expressed that fan-created content ""really is the best part"" of making Among Us, and Bromander called it ""my favorite thing to see"". The game popularized the slang word ""sus"" (meaning ""suspicious"" or ""suspect""), which had been used before the game's release. Other slang terms as well as internet memes popularized and inspired by Among Us include 'Sussy' and 'Sussy Baka' (derived from ""sus""), 'When the Imposter is Sus' (an ironic meme based on Among Us, usually alongside an edited photo of Jerma985), and 'Amogus' (satiric misspelling of ""Among Us"").

12697,"Fun to play with the right people. A good amount of available tasks and roles on both sides keep it interesting.
The same goes for the maps. They come in different sizes, which is good if you want to play with a lot or with lesser players. A big variation of cosmetics makes it possible to shift into your ideal self.

The hype might be over, but it is still a great game to play."

12700,"I played 333.3 hours. I mainly reviewing this just to see that at some point I had 333.3 hours.

Amongus get's boring after a while, the maps, the tasks, the rush you get when you're the last impostor and you need to lie to survive. But this all gets really repetitive and boring after a while. It mainly gets boring because of the public lobbies and the people you meet on this game. It's so draining to play against stupid people in public lobbies, they don't have common sense and half the time they don't talk. when they do, they don't talk much. People actually managed to hack this game and you see them pretty often locking the doors and sabotaging O2/Reactor to get a really quick win. Most of the time, they hack after they get killed or ejected because they're pissed and they wanna vent on you. Hackers aren't the worst part of the community, not by far. The trolls are the worst and they're so fucking common... it's insane. The majority of the playerbase is just people who wanna join lobbies JUST to troll. You're gonna have a lot of people joining your full lobby you spent 10 minutes waiting for it to fill up to max capacity only to have 4 people leave just as it starts because they're not impostors. So now you've got 11 people in the lobby and you're gonna get an idiot who calls a meeting and then leaves. It's sooo common to have someone call a meeting just as the game starts. It's the most annoying troll play of them all. And when people aren't trolling or hacking, they're just annoying to play with. Because among us is so cheap and accessible, you get a really broad demographic. And because the world is mostly populated by retards, you get a lot of them on Among us. Especially cause it's a cheap game with a low skill ceiling, you're gonna see every dumbshit in households from the lower class of every country in the world playing with you. This could all be avoided if you have friends to play with and hang out on among us but let's be real. Most of us don't have enough friends to play or the friends that we do have don't play this shit. So we're left with no option but to play with randoms.

Even if you play with friends, the game will get repetitive because you're all gonna get used to each other, games will start going the same way and you'll all get familiar with each other's patterns and MOs. I guess that playing different game modes and different maps is a bit of a mix up to the monotonous formula... but it's bringing variety. It's not a game that has unlimited replayability, you're gonna reach a point you get bored and you had enough. That's not necessarily a bad thing, mind you... but it could vary wildly. I had a lot of fun with this game and a lot of hours on it. For 2 euros, I got 333 hours of game time. I'd say that's pretty bloody good. Maybe i didn't have 333 hours of fun but I did enjoy it for the most part. If the pricing of the game was higher, this review would be different.

The best update and the best change to this game was undoubtedly the roles. Shifters, engineers, scientists and angels helped add another layer of complexity to the game and a difficulty without breaking the formula. It naturally fit into the rhythm of the core gameplay. There was inevitably a lot of confusion (and still is) about roles after their addition with a lot of people calling meetings because they saw an engineer vent. This happened SO MANY FUCKING TIMES. But that's a people problem, not a gameplay problem. If we saw more changes like that: additions to the core gameplay that doesn't subtract from the game's formula but adds to it then the game would become amazing. Let's actually wrap this up by talking more about the people problem.

See the game itself is actually pretty good despite the fact that it looks simplistic and is a giant meme. Don't let the fruity graphics and the comedic theme of the game distract you, Among us CAN be a mature game that has a high skill ceiling which you can take seriously. It's designed and programmed well (with a few tolerable bugs here and there). It can accomodate a less retarded audience of people who wanna stimulate some braincells and do some high IQ social engineering for fun. The problem is that this doesn't usually happened, not by design but because of the people. This is the same case with VRChat, good intentions and game idea that got corrupt by the malaise of people that got into it because of the accessibility and it's low price tag.

It's a good game but a shit community... probably cause of who it was marketed to mostly. It's worth it but you're gonna have to make compromises and put up with a lot of shit if you wanna get some enjoyment out of it. If you're a person with an IQ above 100, you're gonna struggle keeping your nerves cool while you deal with kids and trolls in every game. Likewise, if you're a troll then just disregard everything I said and just hop in and do your thing, you prick.

Maybe you were expecting another amogus meme review but I felt this game deserved some attention and love for the things it does Right, not the pop culture effects it had or the annoying demographic of idiots it inevitably attracts. This was my dry, honest opinion of Among Us."

How does one live with the knowledge knowing that they have created such terrible game. I will never be opening this game up again and will be deleting my steam account immediately once I am done with this review just so I never have to see or hear about it again. This game has quite literally ruined my life, I was in a game and a 7 year old child said over global chat ""the imposter is sus"" and now I can't use my legs properly my motor skills have stopped functioning and its just been a downhill climb from there. I can't live with this game on my computer after this review I am going to destroy my hard drive with a very large mettalic object. I am going to wash out my computer with soup until you can see the micro transistors then once I can see them I will burn them with a blow torch. Them I will smack it on the ground multiple times. I am going to be opening a lawsuit on steam for enabling people to play such a rancid game. I can not eat food properly anymore every time I look at a vegetable it reminds me of this dog butt-hole of a game and I just can't go forward in life. Everyone who has ever known me drifted away as soon as they saw this game in my steam library. Please do not do what I did and ruin you entire life."

Yeah, great game of player elimination, subterfuge and fun little microgames.  You can't go wrong here and their mtx method is purely cosmetic and each map feels different enough that the element of player interaction and the fact that being eliminated isn't a full blown punishment (especially if Guardian Angel is active) also makes it surpass other mechanical concepts which apply it.

Not to mention games are super fast, poor sports usually see themselves to the door fast and strategy is so dynamic that you can always have a good time, be you soloing or playing with a group.

You already know whether or not you want the game but if you're on the fence?  Buy it, play 5 games and if it doesn't hook ya then refund."

13049,"Once fun, but this game is a classic example of devs doing about the worst possible things after the game blew up. It took way too long for the most basic of content to come out(no new maps or modes or anything for a long time) and the content that was released wasnt really great. Then i leave for a while and it says that i now have to have parental approval to play this game? To do this i have to give part of of my ssn or give a random website my card(no thanks). I'm sorry but i paid for this game already, this should be enough proof im old enough. Honestly would refund this game if i could now. This was fun in its height, but the devs really screwed it by not adding to it for forever and then adding restrictions on new players."

Isolating your target so no one witnesses the crime is the easiest way to get away with it, but if you do get caught by only one other person, being able to pin the kill on them by lying over in-game text chat or an external voice app like Discord can save you from being cast out."

The unanimous Declaration of the eight united Crewmates of Among Us

When in the Course of ඞmogusa game of Among Us 🇺🇸, it becomes necessary for one crew to dissolve the sussy bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powerussys 👙👙 of the shipussy, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of gamers requires that they should mald about the causes which impel them to the ejection of the sus.

We hold these truths to be the opposite of sus, that all Crewmates are created equal, that they are endowed by Innersloth with certain unalienable Conditions, that Amongඞ Us are Impostors, Crewmates and the completion of Tasks.” — That to secure the victory of the Crewmates, Emergency Meetings are instituted Among Us, deriving their just powers from the consent of the Crewmates, —That whenever any Form of Sussiness 💅💅💅 becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the Crewmates to eject it, and to institute new Emergency Meetings, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Survival. Logical deduction, indeed, will dictate that Impostors should not be ඞAmong Us for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that Crewmates are more disposed to suffer, while ejections are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of failed tasks, pursuing invariably the same Impostor Win evinces a design to kill 🔫😐👾 all the Crewmates, it is their right, it is their duty, to eject the impostors and to provide new Guards ✨ for their future security.

Such has been the patient sufferance of these Crewmates; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to hold an Emergency Meeting. The history of the present 🌚 Accused 😱 Crewmate is a history of repeated failed tasks, all having in direct object the establishment of ✨🌸 death!!! violence!!!! piles of bodies!!! <333333 :DDDDDDDD 🌸✨. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to 🔛🔛 Discord Voice Chat.

He has refused his card swipe, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his 🤪😂🤣📮🚘 Crewmates to clean the O2 filter, because he said “i am trash like these leaves are i kin them you cant take them away”, and has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has called together Emergency Meetings at times unusual, uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance 🍆🍑🍑🍑💦💦 >.<what 😳 are 👀 you doing stepbro 👅 HELLO?? with his measures 😈.

He has remained stationary at the asteroids station for two (2) minutes, yet the gun 🍆 on the outer part of the ship has not fired 😳 💦💦 a single time.

He 🧠 has refused to Empty Chute, preferring to let the spaceship rot in FILTH and COCKROACHES, to reflect his current standard of living (SOL - From Investopedia: Standard of living refers to the quantity and quality of material goods and services available to a given population.) in the real world. Because hes a neet like you (the reader) are

He has kept Among Us, in times of peace, Assorted Weaponry without the Consent of his Crewmates.

For quartering large bodies of Crewmates Among Us:

For 😍🍆 ejecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Crewmates of this spaceship:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Crewmate.

He is at this time murdering Blue 🚹 Crewmate (may he rest in peace inshallah 🙏🙏🙏 grapeee 🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇) , as observed by Green Crewmate, to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized spaceship.

He has constrained our fellow Crewmates to bear Arms against one another, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by venting ( announcement: please put vents in #vent idc about your emotional crises)⌨️ while the CCTV 📸 was on.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Emergency Meetings have been answered only by repeated injury. A Crewmate, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define an Impostor, is unfit to be a member of a Spaceship of Crewmates.

❌❌❌ Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Crewmate brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their Crewmate lookalikes to stab the shit out of us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.

We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation via Ejection 🤰🤰, and hold them, as we hold the rest of Crewmatekind, Sussies in War, in Peace Friends.

""We, therefore, the Representatives of the Spaceship, in Emergency Meetings, Assembled, appealing to the Electorate for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of this Spaceship 🚀, solemnly publish and declare, That these Crewmates are, and of Right ought to let this Impostor Boil In Space; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the Impostor, and that all sus 🦶🏼📸 connection between them and this Crewmate, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Ejected Crewmates, they have no Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent Crewmates may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Innersloth, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our Sacred Honour."" ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

13143,"I'm not making this long but:

It's an overall very good game, but I really don't trust a game THAT much to put my credit card or SS number just to make a custom name and talk.  It is really annoying to use the wheel thing, and most of the time you can't find or say what you need to say.  By that time, people would've already voted you out. I am NOT putting my personal information to a game and I really think this should be changed.  It is ESSENTIAL to be able to type whatever you want in a match because you can express what happened and be able to play the game.

Like I said, amazing game, love it, keep making progress on it, but I've lost my interest in it. I've tried to uninstall and do LITERALLY EVERYTHING to bypass this. I really think it's a good idea, but I don't trust any game enough to put my information in.

13219,Game is absolutely horrible.... Way to sussy for me!!!
13220,ruined the game
13221,"I understand the game needed an update and they're completely optional, but the new roles make the game a melting pot of who's who where you can never be certain of anything and everyone is voted off for everything. The random voting was bad before but the developers decided to up the difficulty for the crewmate 100x with shape shifters and imposter bait roles. Now the only way to win with any average imposter is through meta gaming or a task win.

Instead of these garbage new roles, maybe there could be a trapping system implemented? It would spice things up if instead of a disguiser you had a trapper who could booby-trap tasks that would for a limited time window blow up in crewmate's face- maybe literally. Then you could also have counter trappers on the crewmate's team who could detect and disarm traps. This way no one is getting randomly voted with no way to defend themselves because an imposter decided to frame them in the easiest way possible."

13223,Amogus
13224,"Yes very sus
"
13225,Among Us is quite sus if i say so myself. I do not condone murder like this game does but the murder is cartoony so i will accept it. I personally hate spongebob so cartoon violence is a go for me. I still think that kids may be turned away from all of the violence though. I know spongebob is poppin' with the kids. You might want to start being less sus if you want to keep ur players. Have a wonderful weekend easter baby !!

13354,It's alright. I used to play this all the time when it was popular but now I'm burnt out of it and probably will be for a while. Unless you are actually going to play it and enjoy it I don't recommend. (I recommend getting the free mobile version to try it out before buying it here)

13386,"So long story short, i went into space with a few friends of mine. 
We realized that one of our friends had this disease called ""Unexpected Susness"".
He decided that we weren't ""sus"" enough for him and he wanted to give us the gift of this illness.
He hunted us down inside our space ship and killed all of my friends, with me being the only survivor of this massacre. 

To this day, i am traumatised beyond belief, but it's almost been 2 years now.. I should be fine by now.
I went to a therapist and they started to see some changes in my speech.
I think.. He somehow infected my with this illness..

I think..

I think i am sus.."

13393,this game ruined my life. i cannot go a second without seeing amongus. i cant hear the words sus or imposter without thinking of amongus
13394,Would love to play a game with all the same language spoken by everyone and a quarter of the server leaving because they didn't get Imposter.
13395,fun fact: i like this game it needs more updates
13396,"This game is great to play with friends and strangers a-like however has some cautions I'd like to address.
-There ARE hackers and trolls that try to ruin the game for people. 
-If they don't agree with your opinion you're booted.
-When hosting a game, make sure to invite at least 6 of your own friends to join you because you're more likely to get your room disbanded before you can actually create a game. :/ This is a feature I really dislike and think the algorithm should boost smaller rooms first when others are looking to find a game.
-It would be cool if this game had a friend tab. To add players you'd like to play with again in-game, cos unless you're willing to publicly announce your steam username... Its highly unlikely you'll bump into people you meet in-game again.
-the playerbase can be seriously toxic and will just abuse players with other opinions. It seriously sucks.
-It has the UNO flaw, it can cause rifts between friends at times if not careful. 

All in all, this game has a good concept, no lag, straightforward game with a solid base but the playerbase sucks. And I'd only play this game if I had friends I trusted not to get too sensitive to play with me. I WOULD recommend this game as one of those time-fillers and a fun little option for you and others but I wouldnt say its a Perfect Game."
13397,"Although Among us is kind of sus it has very ""ventable"" sussy imposters/crewmates roaming around the place this game puts me at the edge of my seat wondering if I'm gonna die as a crewmate or get yeeted out when I'm imposter I love the rush it's amazing I 100 percent recommended.!"

13463,"This game was the bridge between me enjoying games as a kid and enjoying them as an adult. 

The basic idea is simple and you can understand it pretty easily. Once you get to the point where you memorize a map, and can remember where and when you saw people, you can start to get clever with it. Predicting who killed here and who vented there. 

The barrier of entry is low and a brand new player can enjoy a game with someone who has hundreds of hours in the game, assuming nobody takes it too seriously. 

Each round can vary a lot in terms of length based on which map you're on, how many players their are, how many tasks/impostors there are. But all-in-all, I like to think of each round as a little 'nugget' A bite-sized game where each one is unique and different from the last. 

I could unironically talk about this game for a while. I love the way you can learn to get better at imposter. I love winning a game as a solo impostor. As of now, it's my most played game on steam. And I am confident I have close to, if not more, hours in the game on my phone. It's a game I can pick up for one round, or play for an hour or two. It's an indescribable level of fun to play with friends on a voice chat. It really brought me back to being a kid and just itching to play more because I was having so much fun. The memes and shitposts that have come out of this game are top-notch. ""Among us sussy balls"" will forever make me laugh until the day I day, and I hope it gets put on my tombstone. 

I cannot recommend this game enough."

13553,"If you had any friends before, you won't have any after playing this game. Luckily I play with an incredibly friendly and chill group :)

The best social deduction game I have ever played. Formed some of my best late night 2020 memories back when it was the trendiest game. Very simple game with a low skill floor. Buying this on Steam and playing with KBM will massively improve your quality of life. It is cheap and you intend to regularly play this, it is an incredible step-up from mobile gaming (despite the app on mobile being free). 

However, you need to have at least ten friends and organise a game night to get the most out of this game. I would not recommend playing this in public lobbies.

If you decide to play this game, just don't forget that it is only a game. Don't let your emotions consume you and destroy something more important than a meaningless victory :)

13562,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.
Strategy
His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.
The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.
A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.
The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.
However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.
Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.
It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.
In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.
Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.
When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.
Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.
Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.
If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.
For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.

13786,"This game is super fun! It's definitely better if you have friends, but it's not bad to play with randoms either. I started playing when the game picked up popularity (for a few months) and then changed computers. 

I recently reinstalled it to play and the changes are nice. You can now have a friends list, larger parties, new map, new sub roles within being a crewmate/imposter, more customization and earning content, and just some extra little features.       However, I will say that since the recent changes I am unable to link my account to Steam at this time. Because of that I have lost my holiday customization items and the previous ones like the red horns, etc. I haven't been able to figure out how I can get those back, hopefully they'll fix it so I can have those again.

Overall, I do recommend the game, its a great party game with friends, available on other platforms, too. 8/10"
13787,"Its great! I recommend this game for people who like murder mystery! Its very cheap to its only $5.00 dollars! It has a lot of updates to. Here are roles to, so you don't get confused. Imposter: Your job is to keep it secret and kill all of the crewmates without voted out. Crewmate: Your job is simple, finish all your tasks and make sure not to get killed. Gaurdian Angel: Protect crewmates from dying for a couple seconds from imposter. Engineer: You can vent even if you aren't imposter. Scientest: You can see who is dead or alive.

The amount of times i've seen my little character get stabbed, shot, have his neck snapped, and die of asphyxiation after being sent into space is immense.
I cannot handle this anymore.
Everytime I get accused as impostor, I always tell my alibi and no one seems to believe me. It's as if they all are racist towards my brown, toilet cleaning, cleansing agent.
And for some reason, when I get killed by a pink (female) character, they always side with them even if it was so obvious they are the murderer.
I am tired of this racism, and sexism directed towards me."

Far in the vast regions of space, there’s a crew completing tasks on one ship.  Unfortunately, one of the crewmembers is an imposter who will stop at nothing to murder the rest of the crew. Can the crew figure out who the imposter is before they all die?

I already summed up the plot in the first paragraph and that’s really all there is to it. You start a game of Among Us with friends, get the role of imposter or crewmate and either complete tasks or kill everyone. My board game group and I even have a special Among Us night on Thursdays. The game used to only have two roles, crewmate and imposter.  Crewmates solve tasks and imposters kill everyone. Now crewmates can win by two ways, ejecting the correct imposter, or completing all the tasks. Imposters, on the other hand, can only win by killing crewmates until there is an equal number of crewmates and imposters on the ship. However, if a crewmate finds a dead body, it’s their job to report it and call a meeting. This got boring fast. So, the game recently made an update to add four more roles, engineer, scientist, guardian angel and shapeshifter. Engineers use the vents, scientists check for vital signs, guardian angels die and protect the living and shapeshifters change their form so they can frame another player for a kill. However, there is a cooldown after every kill and power use to make the game harder. Me, personally, I prefer being a crewmate and completing tasks. There’s more to do and I’m not that great of a liar.  So, as an imposter, I tend to lose.

I know that this type of gameplay can get repetitive and makes it harder to enjoy over time. However, there are ways to keep the game interesting. One is to find the right group of players, which sounds like an after school special, but it works. The group I play with often likes to make jokes and tries to deduce who the killer is. There was another time I tried to play a round of Among Us with strangers and they just sent anyone they thought was the slightest bit sus down the airshaft. The crew killed more people than the imposters, so it was an easy win for the evil side. You can also play in different modes, such as Hide and Seek where you know who the imposter is but, instead of calling meetings and trying to eject them, you run from them and try to complete your tasks before the imposter kills everyone. So, the game becomes Dead by Daylight in space. There’s also a mod called Town of Us that combines Among Us with Town of Salem, creating more roles for the characters.  Though I don’t think they’re updating that anymore, but I haven’t really checked because I’m lazy.

Another way to keep the game interesting is to invent your own story. Remember the PlayStation 3 game Journey where you play a character you know nothing about going on a journey and seeing images that you can form your own story for? Among Us is sort of like that but less artsy.  Why is there a crew in space? Are they exploring for the sake of exploring? Trying to find more colonies because of bad circumstances on their home planet? What about the Imposter? Are they a spy for a rival organization, or maybe possessed by an alien entity?  Maybe the cooldown count representing the crewmate trying to take back control.  Okay, I stole that last theory off TV Tropes, but it does make sense.

This game is addictive and adds a social element not usually found in video games. I give it 8 out of 10; the very reason I look forward to Thursdays."

But after a few months of not playing it I realize it's a very rewarding experience, so I'm changing this formerly negative review to a positive one."
13940,reeeee4eee
13941,Recommended if you can get a full party of friends to fill a room. Playing with ransoms is significantly less fun.
13942,Trash game. Cannot believe i put 41 hours of my life into this game. Im sorry 0/10
13943,"The only reason i dislike this game is hackers,i played for hrs wanting to be the imposter and would only get picked 1 in 20-30 games, i understand u should enjoy the game no matter what and i did, but the fact that i hardly ever got to be the imposter made it more fun being the imposter, but the very few times i actually got to be the imposter they would call a meeting 10 seconds into the game and i hadnt even done anything and i had players saying to everyone "" its him just trust me its him'' and people would say ""why?"" and once again they would say ""just trust me"" so i would get voted out by dumbass hackers ruining the game, so u play for hrs and get to play as the imposter for a few seconds and get voted out by a hacker who knows who the imposter is without any evidence or anything..... and thats why im a little bitch cos that pisses me off."

(Though I think Red might have vented?)

Not sure, this review is kinda sus."

13959,"This game, when it had that initial boom, was beautiful. It was a lawless wasteland where anything was possible. Wanna pretend to be a girl and get a fake boyfriend? Go for it. Harass people half your age? The world is (was) your oyster! Sadly, now you have to sign into a separate account and it's heavily moderated. Let the people be free!!"

13992,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead- murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time - something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange - uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" - on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."

14056,"This game changed my life. I used to be a depressed, lonely man that was unfortunately stricken with dark and borderline suicidal thoughts. Then, one fateful day, I was adventuring through the ""featured games"" page of Steam. I was unaware of the man I was about to become. The characters and story line drew me in and I subconsciously hit download. At that moment, the game, which I have been playing every single day of my life now, told me to ""buy a noggin"". I was simply shell shocked. It was such a simple command, but it absolutely blew me away. But I wasn't here for the measly pickings. After buying my cobblestone friend I glanced at the bottom of the screen, looking for more. The illuminating ""shop"" button captivated me. It was too late, at that point, my life was about to change forever, and I met him. Something about his wet and slobbery toes made me want to do things. These unspeakable acts I cannot even begin to comprehend. I grabbed the lotion, and before my body was aware of what was about to come, I did. My toes started to curl and I could feel my body growing more lightweight by the second. Inexplicably exasperated, I did what any man would do. I simply did it again. After many sleepless nights, and bleeding body parts, I must say this game has changed me for the better. Seeing this sexy, wet, gooey, sapphire lump has made me want to do things that I am unabashed to address. The doctor says I am at risk of being infertile. No matter the circumstances, I still see myself coming back to this game every sad minute of my life. Some people, including my parents, say it's ""unnatural"" but they would never understand the ecstasy of pure lust I feel when I hear that spine-tingling tone: ""doo-wah"". Some people unfortunately say that it is ""weird to jack off to 'My Singing Monster' characters"" These accusations have proved me one message, that I would like to share with everyone: ""Don't knock it, 'till you try it."" Amen."

14102,"memes aside, it's actually a pretty fun game when you meet the right people.
"
14103,"Got this game right when it came out and it was really fun for about 2 weeks. After that point the developers made some very poor decisions that threw off not just me, but everyone I personally know that played it.

After being away for a whole year I came back to see on the new updates and I can tell you that they have not only reversed those bad decisions, but have since came up with solutions to add more flavor to make the game even more interesting and unpredictable.

It is very enjoyable!"

My only criticism is that I saw a few people who were able to cheat/hack the game somehow. I have been in maybe 2-3 games like this and it sucked the fun out of it completely. Hopefully it has been patched as its a great game overall."

14173,"Fall Guys 2.0. Used to be fun, now it's not, they did basically everything what people wanted but not how they wanted it. It's full of bugs and cheaters and that basically shows that there is one guy working on the game code and another 3 working on visuals. No one plays it and I think that is completely normal because even the remaining players are toxic and don't even look like they want to seriously play it. The problem of the game is that it was made by 3 people 3-4 years ago and then it somehow got attention and they basically weren't prepared for it so they did everything to make it popular for as long as possible and then they lost half of the players by basically not updating the game for 2 months and after releasing the last thing that could save them - the Airship map 3 months later, all of the original players were already gone and it only regained a little bit of popularity for 2 weeks and since then they keep adding more and more boring and pointless updates."

14182,game is actually very fun still when playing with friends or without its still a great game and ever since they added shape shifting its been even more fun. but i would also like to say that they should add more maps and possibly even more game modes its would be even more great. they are only 4 maps and 1 game mode they should definitely add like a hide n seek game mode or something that would be cool  but that's all i have to say... for NOW

14225,"it's a fun game, except i can barely play it without it giving me an error that they couldn't authorise or authenticate my account or something. extremely annoying and it makes the game practically unplayable sometimes."

14232,"Game has a Date Of Birth bug when you start it up. Its glitched and cant be fixed. Not worth playing. I asked for support on the problem since im 20 and im not sharing my ssn information nor my credit card information like that. This game is just ridiculous rn. Customer service didnt want to fix my mistake so its really a bad game with bad developers. 

Don't buy this game unless you wanna play with not a choice of name, as a guest, and with premade chat. 

I STRONGLY DON'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!"

I am 21 years old and have already bought your game through steam, and I put my age as 21 when the game asked me for my age. It is ridiculous that they expect me to put in last 4 of SSN or my credit card when I have already purchased the game, this is absolutely terribly set up and the developers should be very ashamed."

14312,This game asks my mom to give me a permission to play with this bullshit game. I'm adult!!! Why does it ask me to ask my parent?????? What about if they dead? This game is shit...
14313,This game asks for my age everytime i get on and i clicked too fast one time and now the game is requiring a social security number or credit card.  If you type your birthday in wrong once there is no way to type in the chat or add friends without entering a ssn or credit card.  The new update also ruined the game.

14323,
14324,This is fun to play with friends
14325,Whenever I am extremely bored and in need of an ego boost I join the public lobbies. Truly helps me to recognise the true capacity of my brain's inner weavings. (I regret writing all of this)

14331,Was good but now is bad
14332,"Its like fortnite
amogus"
14333,"Totally recommend this game but you need to know these stuff:

1- It's better to play this game with friends rather than randoms, because random players always leave and also kinda hard to find some players that know English well.

2- Better play while on discord because it's much easier to talk for debate rather than typing.

3- Last but not least I ran to some Cheaters some times, Not a lot but still some Cheaters around !!"

14347,"The newest version of the app is broken and if you attempt to log in, it will change your birthday to the next day regardless of what you enter and then if you try to proceed, it will lock you out of your account. I submitted a ticket about the issue and I'm told I need to give out additional permissions of access to my account on some other website to fix it, which is an unacceptable solution to the problem. If my age cannot be changed, why was my age changed to the wrong age? 

Until this issue is fixed, I'm leaving this review. I should not have to give out personal information to a third party site, giving out extra access permissions to my account due to a very obvious technical issue. Fix this.

Update: Issue still not resolved. Sent additional information to the company"

Treat Among Us as a great product with a chance of bricking itself if you say anything in chat."

14460,"Suspicion is a cognition of mistrust in which a person doubts the honesty of another person or believes another person to be guilty of some type of wrongdoing or crime, but without sure proof. Suspicion can also be aroused in response to objects that negatively differ from an expected idea. In the US, the courts use the term ""reasonable suspicion"" in connection with the right of the police to stop people on the street. The word comes from Middle-English via the Old French word ""suspicion"", which is a variation of the Italian word ""sospetto"" (a derivative of the Latin term ""suspectio"", which means ""to watch""). 

English philosopher, statesman, and author Francis Bacon (1561–1626) wrote an essay entitled Of Suspicion, in which he stated that suspicions need to be repressed and well-guarded, because otherwise they will cloud the mind, and cause a ruler to move towards tyranny, due to the fear that his subjects are conspiring against him, and a husband to become jealous and fearful of his wife's interactions with other men. Bacon argued that the root of suspicion was a lack of knowledge; as such, the remedy to suspicion was to learn more about the issue that is troubling you. If a husband is concerned about his wife's male friends, he should ask her about the nature of these friendships and state his concerns, rather than building up his suspicions. Bacon urged people who were harboring suspicions, to be frank with the people that they were suspecting, and clear the matter up.

The English dramatist William Shakespeare noted that ""Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind"". English Renaissance dramatist, poet, and actor Ben Jonson (1572–1637), a contemporary of Shakespeare, described suspicion as a ""black poison"" that ""infects the human mind like a plague"". Samuel Johnson (1709–1784), an English author and essayist, called suspicion a ""useless pain"" in which a person has a belief that a formidable evil lies within all of their fellow men. The Scottish poet and a lyricist Robert Burns (1759–1796) called suspicion a ""heavy armor"" that impedes humans more than it protects them. Mahatma Gandhi, the political and spiritual leader of the non-violent Indian independence movement, warned that if suspicions arise about any of a person's motives, then all of their acts can become tainted with this mistrust and uncertainty."

14485,"Fun 
"
14486,"who tf plays among us for ""70 hours""?!?!?!??"
14487,YOU SHOD TRY!!!!!!!
14488,"I ask you to share with me today the majesty of this moment. In the orderly transfer of power, we celebrate the unity that keeps us free.

Each moment in history is a fleeting time, precious and unique. But some stand out as moments of beginning, in which courses are set that shape decades or centuries.

This can be such a moment.

Forces now are converging that make possible, for the first time, the hope that many of man's deepest aspirations can at last be realized. The spiraling pace of change allows us to contemplate, within our own lifetime, advances that once would have taken centuries.

In throwing wide the horizons of space, we have discovered new horizons on earth.

For the first time, because the people of the world want peace, and the leaders of the world are afraid of war, the times are on the side of peace.

Eight years from now America will celebrate its 200th anniversary as a nation. Within the lifetime of most people now living, mankind will celebrate that great new year which comes only once in a thousand years--the beginning of the third millennium.

What kind of a nation we will be, what kind of a world we will live in, whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes, is ours to determine by our actions and our choices.

The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker. This honor now beckons America--the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil and onto that high ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization.

If we succeed, generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our moment, that we helped make the world safe for mankind.

This is our summons to greatness.

I believe the American people are ready to answer this call.

The second third of this century has been a time of proud achievement. We have made enormous strides in science and industry and agriculture. We have shared our wealth more broadly than ever. We have learned at last to manage a modern economy to assure its continued growth.

We have given freedom new reach. We have begun to make its promise real for black as well as for white.

We see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today. I know America's youth. I believe in them. We can be proud that they are better educated, more committed, more passionately driven by conscience than any generation in our history.

No people has ever been so close to the achievement of a just and abundant society, or so possessed of the will to achieve it. And because our strengths are so great, we can afford to appraise our weaknesses with candor and to approach them with hope.

Standing in this same place a third of a century ago, Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed a nation ravaged by depression and gripped in fear. He could say in surveying the Nation's troubles: ""They concern, thank God, only material things."" Our crisis today is in reverse.

We find ourselves rich in goods, but ragged in spirit; reaching with magnificent precision for the moon, but failing into raucous discord on earth.

We are caught in war, wanting peace. We are torn by division, wanting unity. We see around us empty lives, wanting fulfillment. We see tasks that need doing, waiting for hands to do them.

To a crisis of the spirit, we need an answer of the spirit.

And to find that answer, we need only look within ourselves.

When we listen to ""the better angels of our nature,"" we find that they celebrate the simple things, the basic things--such as goodness, decency, love, kindness.

Greatness comes in simple trappings. The simple things are the ones most needed today if we are to surmount what divides us, and cement what unites us.

To lower our voices would be a simple thing.

In these difficult years, America has suffered from a fever of words; from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver; from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds; from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading.

We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another--until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices.

For its part, government will listen. We will strive to listen in new ways--to the voices of quiet anguish, the voices that speak without words, the voices of the heart--to the injured voices, the anxious voices, the voices that have despaired of being heard.

Those who have been left out, we will try to bring in.

Those left behind, we will help to catch up.

For all of our people, we will set as our goal the decent order that makes progress possible and our lives secure.

As we reach toward our hopes, our task is to build on what has gone before--not turning away from the old, but turning toward the new.

In this past third of a century, government has passed more laws, spent more money, initiated more programs than in all our previous history.

In pursuing our goals of full employment, better housing, excellence in education; in rebuilding our cities and improving our rural areas; in protecting our environment and enhancing the quality of life--in all these and more, we will and must press urgently forward.

We shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be transferred from the destruction of war abroad to the urgent needs of our people at home.

The American dream does not come to those who fall asleep.

But we are approaching the limits of what government alone can do.

Our greatest need now is to reach beyond government, to enlist the legions of the concerned and the committed.

What has to be done, has to be done by government and people together or it will not be done at all. The lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do nothing--with the people we can do everything.

To match the magnitude of our tasks, we need the energies of our people--enlisted not only in grand enterprises, but more importantly in those small, splendid efforts that make headlines in the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal.

With these, we can build a great cathedral of the spirit--each of us raising it one stone at a time, as he reaches out to his neighbor, helping, caring, doing.

I do not offer a life of uninspiring ease. I do not call for a life of grim sacrifice. I ask you to join in a high adventure--one as rich as humanity itself, and exciting as the times we live in.

The essence of freedom is that each of us shares in the shaping of his own destiny.

Until he has been part of a cause larger than himself, no man is truly whole.

The way to fulfillment is in the use of our talents. We achieve nobility in the spirit that inspires that use.

As we measure what can be done, we shall promise only what we know we can produce; but as we chart our goals, we shall be lifted by our dreams.

No man can be fully free while his neighbor is not. To go forward at all is to go forward together.

This means black and white together, as one nation, not two. The laws have caught up with our conscience. What remains is to give life to what is in the law: to insure at last that as all are born equal in dignity before God, all are born equal in dignity before man.

As we learn to go forward together at home, let us also seek to go forward together with all mankind.

Let us take as our goal: Where peace is unknown, make it welcome; where Peace is fragile, make it strong; where peace is temporary, make it permanent.

After a period of confrontation, we are entering an era of negotiation.

14513,"I enjoyed playing this game for a while, but after a few dozen rounds, it got old, especially with better, higher tasking games that I could play instead. If you are trying to get this to play with your friends, it's a great excuse to have someone over and stay up, but if you're trying to get it because you saw an add for it, it's really, really boring without someone that you know playing with you."

14624," I am sorry to inform you all that Innersloth has lied to us about the Among Us Horse Update. There is no Among Us Horse Update, they decepted us. clearly they played a bit too much among us. They played us all as if we were instruments in their song of sorrow of lies. we were merely pieces in their game of chess, we were the pawns. We were the sacrifices, we do the real heavy lifting only to be overshadowed by the most vile species of all, Twitch Streamers. This is why I will be resigning my rank as a tier 3 subscriber to Pokimane. I am shaking and crying rn, I cant believe astronaut crewmate impsoter people would tdo this. Im actually shidding so hard rn"

[list]
  [*] Reduced chat features unless you make an account, because just having a Steam account isn't good enough anymore

  [*] Devs [b]will[/b] collect and use your personal data via Unity Analytics

  [*] Probably nothing, but kinda sus: After uninstalling, the game leaves some Unity files behind, you can find and remove them at:
  C:\Users\<YOUR USERNAME>\AppData\LocalLow\Innersloth\Among Us
[/list]
[hr][/hr]

On the plus side, some of the new content is cool, more maps, etc. I'm glad to see the game getting more content.

For $5, the game it isn't bad, and I've certainly had at least that much entertainment and more from it. But it's a very different game now than when it was originally released. The original was tons of fun with friends; the game now feels more like a chore."

14656,"Fun game to play with friends, especially in VC.

14676,Please leave me and my family alone
14677,"April fools update with horses? Awesome!! I would love to play as a horse. But I CANNOT since the game thinks I am 2 years old (right after I entered my true age). To fix something that is not even my fault, it wants my social security number or credit card. ON TOP OF THIS, I have to pay them MORE MONEY to give them this information? Buying the game with your own credit card isn't good enough? Going into the playerpref file and changing it does not work either as it keeps resetting itself to 2 years. This game is a waste of money and time. Also CANNOT BE PLAYED WITHOUT YOUR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT..."

14689,this game is not just good as a meme it also is a great murderer mystery game and the new roles are great. But the shapeshifter role is so good its bad like its so hard to find them without someone thinking it's you. Also the April Fools joke in 2022 (the one that replaces the players with horses) is great
14690,horse ruined it

14775,"This game is a curse. Ever since I've reached 300 hours play time on it I've been getting phone calls from an unknown number. When I answer it, I don't hear anything. The calls have been going on for at least 8 months and after a while I simply ignored them. 2 days ago I was bored and decided to finally answer one. Of course it was silent as usual... But as I moved my finger to the button to hang up, a voice broke that silence. ""April."" I jolted back in my seat. The only words able to escape my throat are ""I'm sorry?"" But once again silent consumes the room. The call ends. I haven't slept since that night. If no one hears from me by tomorrow, remember my story.








Game is fun with friends btw."

14840,it had a good start but then went downhill with the speed chat update but got back to being popular after adding the new suits and cosmetic sort of things. in conclusion i recommend this for people who just want to pass time.

14842,"men'
"
14843,this game is about teamwork and betrayal it is so very fun i would recommend this to other players.

14852,"This game is fun. I mean, the main characters are frickin' BEANS! You also do not require to pay any money aside from buying the game, which is a cheap 5 Dollars (Or whatever that is converted to your currency for other places). The updates add a lot of good stuff, and although other players can sometimes be a dunce, the experience is worth it."
14853,"It was once a good game, but now its nothing like how it used to be. There is a reason why it died as quickly as it rose.
It deleted all my hard work and dlcs with no way to get them back after I couldn't join because all the servers were ""busy""

This is a cash cow and I wish I never bought it in the first place."
14854,This game is very fun you should try it out oh and if you see some one vent don't always think there the imposter hope you guys like it.
14855,"This game is a work of art, made by satan himself used as a portal to hell itself. Do not play this game. THE SUS ARE COMING, THE SUS ARE COMING. LOCK YOUR DOORS. THEY CAN HEAR YOU. RUN WHILE YOU CAN. PLEASE. RUN."
14856,"If you have like 5+ people to play with either friends (recommended) or just people on among us discords in a voice call or something then its a very fun game trying to figure out who the imposter is and all of that stuff but can also cause broken frendships and trust issues :D
if you dont have people to play with then the game isnt fun at all"
14857,I love the animation and the chat isnt tho

14867,"This is a public service announcement not a review. The games not bad so I'm not going to give it a thumbs down.

If you enjoy this game, play Space Station 13. Among us is a heavily dumbed down version of that beautiful insanity. I can't blame the developers though, they're just making the concept more accessible, so if you like this its a good first stepping stone into a forgotten world.

here is a youtube review of it because i would never be able to match the brilliance of this man's work.

14900,My friends made me play this game  when it was popular. I played it for 116 hours because of them. They never let me sleep.

14920,amoogus is super fun. i like betraying my friends but hate being betrayed but its too funny to not LOL
14921,No.

14924,better then red dead redemption
14925,very good.
14926,"Id say this game is fun in its own rights, its blown up immensely but i will say its not a waste of $5. If you really want to then id sort of recommend it? Other than that always vote red, red is always sus"
14927,"As soon as I opened the game I was prompted to confirm that my guardian would let me do this, then prompted to confirm I was my guardian through debit card. For this I was charged, too? All this, despite me being an adult to begin with. The new parental management is just an annoyance and I don't see why it had to be added, as I can't imagine any kind of parent who even lets their child play video games wouldn't permit them to e.g choose their own username."
14928,way too many roles it gets very annoying

14944,gooooood
14945,"Garbage game. I probably played 30 or so total matches. I believe 1 or 2 were played properly where strangers were enjoying a match together and no one was cheating.

The other 28 times I would watch as my own team would stand around idly not doing tasks or just following other players around while their friend over discord (the impostor) would roll the match. Back when you could still chat in game I'd often ask how that was fun for anyone. Cheaters included.

Now you can't even talk properly, so more people go to discord and cheat.

I'd wait until a game like this comes out that randomizes matches and rips people away from the crutch of cheating pals. It sounds bad when you say it like that, but really, it's the only way to avoid cheese and make the game better for 90% of the playerbase."
14946,"good game but... dumb players there is a reason only YouTubers play in private lobbies all you have to do is say he is sus and they get thrown out and like many other games one update made me quit for good if you want this game now, its too late to have good fun."

14949,"Meme game that was fun to play a couple of times, but after a while the charm fades away and it becomes quite boring. It's nice that the developers still try to spice things up, however the core concept isn't something that I can get into over and over again. Plenty of great moments were had with my friends when we did play this a while back, but nothing would be enough to get me into it again."

14958,This game is fun and has alot of solving with it this game is just a yes and if you dont like it your just not fun or cool
14959,I wasted 70+ hours of my life
14960,"Come on you already know this game. This Game was super fun when it first blew up I would play it with my friends a whole lot and it was for sure an experience. Among Us has a public lobby system that allows you to play even with others you don't know but I would for sure prefer playing with friends as it will get boring if there is no voice in my opinion.  If you do decide to try out this game then I hope you can make memories and enjoy it but that's about it cya!

14961,gaslight people
14962,I can't login. Not here. Nor on Epic. I have downloaded and uninstalled multiple times using multiple ways to link my account. Nothing works.

being a shape shifter imposter is the best"

14967,"When I was a boy I was told I would be a nobody, a man, stricken by his mortality. I was confined by my own lack of self-worth and the imminent approach of death. However, on one solemn evening, I decided to spend my hard-earned $4.99 on this wondrous game. The crewmates, the Imposters, everything about it a true masterpiece. Remove my balls and slap me silly if I ever find a game that can match such an innate masterpiece."
14968,cvafsW
14969,god this game is so fucking good i just love being sus ;)
14970,There are politicians who've had less of a cultural impact on society than this game.
14971,"I got this game 4 years back now I regret it and can't stop thinking of it
10/10 gave me PTSD"
14972,Always fun and games playing with mates
14973,"Good game, actually really good,  Just people memed the game to death."
14974,Good Game :)
14975,"This game changed my life for the better. I can now read all my friends and have ruined my friendships with my excessive scrutiny. I now carry suspicion and mistrust into my everyday life and can no longer view relationships as anything but attempts by others to betray me. I live alone now and keep everyone within arm's reach. I feel wiser. Smarter. Happier? Perhaps not, but at least my new mindset gives me the ecstasy for good detective work. I now see Among Us everywhere I go. Bin? Among us. Chopping board? That's sussy. Red phone? Sus, sus, sussy! I don't fucking care anymore. The brief ecstasy this game and its connotations give me are a brief respite for those moments when I leave the voice call and get the cold feeling that nobody will ever truly want to get me. But that's because they're all impostors. And a smile crosses my face, because that means in this Skeld of a world, in this Polus of a universe, I am the only crewmate."

14978,"This game either kills or strokes your ego massively, you either feel like fucking Sherlock Holmes in a room with children or your the guy getting immediately called out in 000.4 seconds from Steven Hawking himself. Despite this though, it makes as a good party game or a once-in-a-while type thing. You'll have the most fun playing with your friends as lobbies are complete trash, and sometimes the games can go on for 5 minutes or 20 depending on how comply-able everyone wants to be. 
I'd give this a 6/10 - Worth the play I think ඞ"

- Nice graphic and gentle for an old PC
- Simple but good system
- Lots of costume and decoration
- Small price
- Just give it a try"

I jumped on the Among Us bandwagon when it first got popular, and have still been playing it to this day. Yes, the ""who done it?"" style game is a thing a lot of people have created, but the style of Among Us is something new. I also just appreciate how the developers have listened to the community, and I always appreciate a smaller development team getting some love. 
As of writing this review, I have 120 hours on the game, and I still like coming back to it. I can't wait to see what new things are added to the game in the future."

15107,I literally watched a person get bullied until they said they were going to kill themself and the people just kept dogging on them. The game isnt even a game anymore. It is a haven for people to bully other players until they either harm themselves or others and I dont think the developers do anything to stop it. Such a waste of a game nowadays.

15116,"I recommend it to people who like mysteries and solving puzzles. I think that because that's pretty much what this game is about. One reason is because there is 1-3 killers in the game among 4-15 players. Sometimes they give hints and make it obvious that they are it but some are actually not easy to catch. This game can also be like how fast you can solve a puzzle because there is limited time before either the crewmates(innocent) finsih there task, or the imposter(s) kill enough people to finish off the game. There are some in-game purchases but they are all worth the price because some in-game purchases let you have cool pets other in-game purchases let you have a certain amount of something that you could use to buy and make cooler outfits with but that is only something you can do it doesn't give any special effects. There are also roles in this game : Imposter = normal(Kill enough crewmates to win you may have teammates but they might get caught so it is more important for YOU not to get caught by the crewmates.)   and shapeshifter(diguise as other players to frame them but becareful it doesn't last forever and leaves behind evidence) Crewmates : Scientist(able to see when crewmates and which crewmates are dead or alive. There is a battery to the device though. You can charge it up by doing tasks that you were assigned in the game which are completely random.) Guardian Angel (You died but you can protect some crewmates for limited time from being killed by the imposter.) and one other role that I forgot the name and what it does. That will be all the information you will need that is not already in the game for you. Once you download it should show either recent updates and how to play or just how to play it!"

15141,"[h1] Info [/h1] 
Among Us. The Game That Suddenly Blew Up In 2020 For No Reason At All, If You've Been On The Internet There's No Way You Haven't Heard Of It. There's At Least 300.000 Sh*tposts Of It On The Internet And It's Still Quite Popular Today As A Meme. The Game Is Literally Just Murder Mystery With Silly Spacemen, And If You Don't Know What Murder Mystery Is I'm Very Disappointed But I'm Gonna Explain Anyways. There's A Group Of People That Has Do Certain Things To Win The Game But There's An Imposter Among Them And The Imposter Have To Sabotages And Or Kill The Normal People To Win. There Can Be Like At Least 2 Imposters And Then Like 10 Normal People? The Normal People Has To Vote Out Or Kill The Imposters But That Gameplay Is Different From Game To Game. And To Clarify You Vote People Out In Among Us, But Yeah In Among Us You're Basically Just A Crewmate That Has To Do Task To Win The Game While Someone Is Trying To Sabotage You. 

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] 
Well There's 4 Maps And You Do The Same Thing In Each, You Complete Tasks To Win Whilst Also Trying To Catch The Imposter. There Really Isn't Much To It. There Isn't A Voice Chat, You Can Only Text And Arguments Can Get Pretty Heated. There's Really Not Much More To Add Here. You Just Do The Same Tasks With Different Rules Maybe Like More Move Speed Or Less Vision And That's Pretty Much It. I've Also Heard That They've Added More Roles And Idk What The F**ks Up With Those But I'm Gonna Guess It's Still Pretty Boring. 

[h1] My Thoughts [/h1] 
Yeah I Used To Play This With Some Friends Or Alone, I Somehow Found It Entertaining Enough To Play It For 79 Hours So That's Something, But Whenever I Try To Play It Again I Really Can't Bring Myself To Do It, And That's Because It's F**king Boring. Play 3 Games Alone With And You'll Really Start To Regret Your Life Choices, Play 3 Times With Your Friends And Then You Start Questioning Their Loyalty, This Game Is All About Manipulation And Trust And Sure It Can Be Fun For Like A Round And Then You Get A Sh*t Lobby Again And The Fun Quickly Goes Down To 0 Because This Community Can Be Straight Up Ass Sometimes, Some People In Here Are Like 4 Years Old While Other's Are 15 Year Old Boys Looking For A Girlfriend Like Fam Get The Fu*k Outta Here This Is ""Among Us"" Not F**king Tinder, Then There's The People Who Cheat, Yeah Some People Cheat In F**king Among Us, I Wish That Was A Joke But It's Not, They Either Cheat By Being In A Vc With Their Friend, And When Their Friend Get's Killed They Begin To Snitch Like A 6 Year Old, And Every Lobby I've Been In Has Not Given 2 F**ks About Someone Cheating, They're Like ""Yeah Nah Fam, I'll Pretend I Didn't See That"" And Move On With Their Day. Then There's People Who Literally Cheat Like Seeing Who The Imposter Is Or Some Sh*t And That's Just Depressing, I Don't Even Have Anything To Say To Those Guys. 
  
[h1] Not Recommended Move On [/h1] 
I'd Really Not Recommend Among Us If You're Playing Alone Or Even With Friends, I Know The Game Is Cheap But There's Free Murder Mystery Games Out There And Among Us Really Isn't Worth Your Time, If I Could Go Back In Time I Wouldn't Spend 4 Euro's On This Game And That's Because The Game Gets Boring And The Community Is Straight Up Dog Sh*t, That's What I Have To Say, So I Would Recommend You, Spend You 4 Euro's On Something Else, And To Clarify I Have Nothing Against The , Devs I Just Find The Game Concept Boring And The Community Bad."
15142,"I love this game a lot. However, I've been having so many problems with it lately. It's not loading anything, even hosting games. Even when it did work, it was slow to load and I'd be dead most of the time before I could even play. I've tried resetting my account, but all it did was get rid of everything I've spent hours trying to get. This was expected, and I did read the terms, but I was hoping it would at least let me play. I tried restarting Steam but that didn't help either. I also tried restarting the PC itself, but with no success. I'm extremely frustrated and hope someone can help."

I'd say it is kid friendly and maybe even a little bit educational considering negotiation and in the game, a long with timed sabotages and the little puzzles in tasks. 9/10 game, would recommend to anyone, and it is only 5 dollars so you wouldn't be spending a bunch."

""YoUr'E OnLy VoTiNg Me BeCaUsE My ChArAcTeR Is bLaCk!"" Is my favourite argument starter. Works a charm!

I also find that chasing random people makes em scared, hit the emergency button, gets you voted out, they look like they lying so they get voted out next round. Absolute classic. Lmao

15293,Not my cup of tea main reason I suck at lying 😅
15294,meh
15295,Fun party game.
15296,"IT'S SO GOOD such a great game with so much depth and so many different ways to play.. and I really love how much the game will straight up feel like an entirely different experience depending on the group you are playing with!! this is very much due to a huge part of this game being something that will test your social skills, which is obviously going to vary depending on who's playing!

and it's SO much more than just being good at lying. you have to also be good at telling the TRUTH when needed and communicating properly and working as a team and it's just... so fun how this game will just absolutely put your ability to communicate to the test and being good at words is what's gonna get you to win 50% of the time..

 but of course there's so much core gameplay strategy too and the new roles add so much.. it's literally such a complex and fun social strategy game with so much potential, that I wish would get more attention and love nowadays aside from the memes.. ah well!! it exists and that's enough c:"

15340,It is a fun game that can either be played online with others you don't know or rooms can be created as a safe space for kids and family and friends to play games. I like all of the options and ways to update the characters.

15360,"Among Us is an amazing friendship-breaking online multiplayer game. You are put on one of two teams at the start of the game; crewmates or impostors. The crewmates find and vote off the impostors and do tasks while the impostors try to kill everyone before getting voted off. The only problem besides the free chat block is that there is not a great way of getting into a good public lobby every time. If you play with your friends it's fine, but public lobbies can have trolls."

15413,"Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03’ tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more."

15418,"I love how interactive it is. You get to use your brain to come up with clues on who might be the imposter (or  imposters). You also have a chance to interact with others and possibly make new friends, which I find awesome. This game is a great way to spend time with others and it is definitely a fun game that I would totally recommend others to try."

The truth goes unspoken
I’ve even forgotten my name

I don’t know the season
Or what is the reason
I'm standing here holding my blade

A desolate place (place)
Without any trace (trace)
It’s only the cold wind I feel

It’s me that I spite
As I stand up and fight
The only thing I know for real

There will be blood-shed
The man in the mirror nods his head
The only one left
Will ride upon the dragon’s back

Because the mountains don’t give back what they take
Oh, no, there will be blood-shed
It’s the only thing I’ve ever known

Losing my identity
Wondering have I gone insane?
To find the truth in front of me

I must climb this mountain range
Looking downward from this deadly height
And never realizing why I fight

15515,"This game is a lot of fun, you can really play it however you like, just for casual fun, strategic gaming or utter chaos its really up to you and who you're playing with.  I will say it can take a bit of a search to find a group of players you get on well with but it is worth the patience because when you find a group you get on well with you can play a good few hours away easily."

15525,"Simple game about trying to figure out who among you is an impostor out to kill everyone. It's fun with the right group of friends; though a bit jank in a ""made-for-mobile"" way."

15542,"This is a game to be best enjoyed with friends and family.
The thrill of constructing your alibi and puzzeling around with your pals on who might be the mischievous baddie among us
really excites me everytime. 
i also once shat my pants, while playing and my friends had to figure out, who it was, this was quiet fun having

15628,"Hollow knight was one of my first experiences with a platformer game, and let me tell you, it was one of the best. The graphics are never demanding on your system, but still stunningly beautiful. The wonders of the colors and different views were capturing and helped really get immersed in the game. The sound track is fantastic and there are so many different areas to explore all including cool new enemies and bosses. The story line is complex and builds lore from the very beginning. You really get the sense that you're getting more powerful as you progress thanks to all the new abilities you can acquire, later on letting you reach certain places you couldn't before. The characters that you meet along the way are fun and interesting bugs that which make interacting with them fascinating (don't trust the banker :)). Overall, I'd recommend hollow knight to anyone and everyone. It's truly in my top 5 games for sure. Give it a try!"

15630,"this is very fun, if you know how to play it that is...
this game has a cool feature where you can be crewmate, scientist, impostor and my favorite,  shapeshifter.
as a crewmate, well, there's nothing special bout crewmate.
as a scientist, you can check vitals at any time to see if anyone's dead.
as an impostor, kill everyone
as a shapshifter, also kill everyone, but do it sneaky. you can transform into any crewmate in the game."

15718,I am  a very lonely man so i only got one friend. The game does not allow 2 players to play so its not very poggers. I would like a refund 10x cause i made 10 acounts cause im lonely and played from 10 pcs at a time. This is a very serious review and do not think im joking. Thank you for coming to my TedTalk. Love you xoxo your favourite KPOP star Jake Paul
15719,"please do not play this bullshit if i hear one more white girl say my penis looks like the imposter i am going to explode and pop another vicadin trust me i will hit my son again im just waiting for the next oppurtunity to strike once again.

15728,"This game is as good as you make it. It all depends on the lobby of people and the rules you're playing with. You can adjust the rules to fit the playstyle you enjoy, but finding a like-minded group can be challenging. The game can range from an intelligent memory and logic exercise with strategic deception and sabotage, to a cracked out game for ADHD kids with witch hunt style voting where remembering who just passed you is beyond pointless, and the rule settings can easily accommodate both groups. You do have to either get very lucky or have a group of friends to play with to get a half decent game some days, with trolls, rage kids, people who seem to be operating their phone controls with their noses, and half the lobby insta-quitting when they don't get imposter. But when the game is good, the game is really good and rewarding to play. The tasks are somehow still fun after completing them hundreds of times. I'm 40+ hours in and I've still only played the 1 map and just now feel like I'm a master at it. Servers go slightly bugged out sometimes, tasks are broken or people spawn already dead, but that's pretty rare, overall it's well made. I'd say definitely get this if you at all like puzzles or strategy. If you are one of the kids who need to pop a couple aderol, there's probably better options out there, but you can make it work."
15729,i think im constipated or something because its very hard for me to shit i need to go see a doctor about this

This means the only way to access chat options in this game is to give a website my social security number or credit card number. This means that I, someone who doesn't want to give away such majorly sensitive info, am stuck without a major part of the game."

15994,"Simplistic and very addictive, replay value is 100%, keyboard chat and controller integration is almost flawless. this is the best platform to play this game on. players do frequently drop but i dont know if that is a result of them just leaving, they being on cellular plans with phones that are poor or a matchmaking network issue.

Overall the game is cheap and fun, and i normally scoff at ""coin pack"" in game purchases but for a few you might want its so cheap its negligable and not repetitivley necessary. buy it have fun throwing folks out the air lock or trying to be sneaky and kill without being seen!

I seriously wish i would have come up with this idea, its pure genius"

16002,"this game is quite the game of the century. this game is pretty sus overall but most of the time i was innocent. i believe that red was sus about 60% of the time but overall i think blue had something coming for him. cause he was a  bastard he took away the love love of my life yellow and I never forgave him I loved them so much with a burning passion I loved them so badly that I was willing to give my whole life up for her.

But In the end it didn't last long for blue and I have my beautiful yellow back how much I love them and Since then I have taken the liberty of becoming head crew mate chief since red does not do much but act very sus. he will go down with the rest that don't believe in me.

Down with red up with green!

16053,"Connection terminated. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name, But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although, you have indeed been called. You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach, but you will never find them. None of you will. This is where your story ends. And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirits. They don't belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend. My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours, and then, what became of you. I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It's time to rest - for you, and for those you have carried in your arms. This ends for all of us. End communication."

16127,"The game doesn't work upon opening. Whenever I open it, the game is stuck on a loading screen with a small green character running amok. It eventually just asks to play offline (which is just not fun) so I click it and try to sign in (Sign in/Play as guest). When I click those, the screen fades a bit and the same character spins around at the bottom right corner. It then says it isn't working. I've done literally everything I can find online to fix this and it isn't working. What should I do?

16299,when the imposter is sus ඞ
16300,"The creation of Among Us and it's consequences have been a disaster for the human race. Just a few months after youtubers and twitch streamers brought it to fame, it had been loaded with kids infested with the hype of the game among us. Furthermore, the constant use of Among us had rendered the game boring, as it entered the downfall stage of a game's popularity, just like Fall Guys. However, this is not something you should celebrate; since the constant use had also brought a new genre or era of memes, often referred to as post-irony. A bastardized version of Among Us called ""Amogus"" was used for the game in these meme's contexts, going viral in the Urban Dictionary. All the cultures of normie memes and pre-2020 memes have been wiped off as the ""Amogus"" meme exploded. Post irony has caused a greater disaster where everybody sees things as the crewmate in the mobile game Among Us. As memes began referring to everything as the crewmate, people have been driven to insanity. People who used to be normal looking at memes were now infected by the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon, which renders everything as something they've seen constantly. ""Amogus Everywhere"" is the bastardized name of the Phenomenon. Capitalistic-driven people have been competing for a Amogus-crewmate chicken nugget, costing $100,000 at an auction. I hope life returns to normal as Among Us and Amogus have been wiped of the face of this Earth."

16362,great game! I recommend this to child predators
16363,"This game was good when I purchased it in 2019. But after many years and the game becoming repetitive I would not recommend buying it on steam. I would get the game on your phone for free, play it for a month and you will save money because it wont be a game you will play everyday."
16364,"I really, really, truly, deeply, love this game. There is not much in my fairly new life that brings an describable spark within my chest. I feel it behind my rib cage and in the back of my throat. I've never felt like this before. This game is without a doubt in my mind, the light of my life. I yearn to play among us, day and night, day and night. I wake up and all I think about is the silly little crewmate sprite. I have become far more observant as well. I am not sure who AMONG those I hold dear has been replaced by an alien. So far I've ""voted out"" my dog Murphy. I have a sneaking SUSpicion that my sluttiest ""friend"", ""Evan"" isn't who he says he is. He started scratching his face with his left hand, rather than his right. He always scratches his face with his right. His BPS (Blinks Per Second) have gone from 0.2 to 0.4. I have learned far to much to consider that a coincidence and brush it under the carpet. I will continue to experiment upon him. If this keeps up, I'll ""vote him out"" by hitting him with my car."

Then there are the people who just straight up quit unless you have a good team of dedicated friends to play with I do not suggest this game.  sorry but that is just how I feel.  it can really toxic in the chat as well depending.  Especially since this game isn't for everyone.  I only wanted to play this because some famous youtubers played it but it really isn't the game for me.  I've been bullied enough in my life and I don't need to be bullied on this game too.

16586,"I think VRHot is awesome! Though my video card is only a GTX-106o, everything else meets or exceeds requirements and it looks pretty great. The movements and reactions are surprisingly good imo. There have been a few hiccups but I attribute that to my GPU. The conversation is repetitive, but I think that is to be expected at this stage. Apparently there is a plan for some kind of 2-way communicatio in the works.

All in all, an excellent sex sinulator. The body modifications are simple and effective. The clothing mods are for the most part decent(indecent?) but there are some shortcomings that I hope can be rectified.
1, Ssomething more sheer in the dress/shirt/panty department.
2. Some more interesting ""stockings"". RHT or full-fashion seamed hose would be great. Also, pantyhose
preferably open crotch or suspender type. Perhaps with selectable colors.

Obviously, this game is not for everyone. My ""recommended"" is more a ""well-done"" to the devs, and if you like this sort of thing , you will definately like this."

16597,4.5 out of 5 stars the game is great especially with all the new updates however there has gotta be a better way of reporting harassment and bullying because some of the lobbies are just awful.

16600,"Among us is a good game if you have friends to play with but playing with randoms is HELL. I really like this game but it's not living up to its full potential, If they added some new game modes or spatial voice chat that would be awesome and would probably bring some old players back to this game, If you are looking for a good murder mystery type game for your pc (or laptop) I recommend Among us"

16618,"I forgot how to report bugs for the game so, uh yea.

At the moment whenever I start up Among Us, it shows up as just a small rectangle, fit to show the icon, minimize, maximize, and close and nothing else. I've tried using Task Manager to see if anything would work. But, nothing. I can't click on anything but the buttons. I've also tried uninstalling the game and reinstalling it. Also nothing. So, yea.

It's been like this for a few days now."

16635,"I would absolutely recommend this! ඞ

How to play:
The aim of the game as an Impostor is to eliminate all of the Crewmates on the ship and supposedly win, you can do this by murdering them OR you can vote them out in Emergency Meetings (Discussions with all of the players)

And the aim of the game for the Crewmates is to do all of their tasks that they are given and win by all of them doing their tasks, OR you can also win by voting out Impostors in Emergency Meetings (Discussions with all of the players)

Over all, If your looking for a new game to play and thinking on purchasing Among us, it is definitely a good game and is recommended! ඞ

16645,AMOGUS🗿🗿
16646,The game is actually great if you disregard the popularity of the game and see it for what it is. Its actually really good

16648,sus
16649,"This is going to be kinda sus, but playing as yellow every game is a meta-game strategy. Definitely is the least killed color in the game. Trust me, bro, I've looked at the statistics. 

With that being said I am almost always killed or voted off first. 

Besides that though this game is amazingly aggravating and will easily get you to flip a house and sell it just to prove to the importers you have some worth in life. Even though they will never know if you play with randoms, it is still the most infuriating game I have played that isn't a first-person shooter. To play with friends is either the best game you will ever play or you will be finding new friends on craigslist after two games. The newest map is the worst most complex map yet. It's even worse when you don't have a full lobby of 15 people. There is just so much to explore and different in-and-outs that traversing the map is like figuring out where the golf ball is after you hit it. 

Now, the new roles they have added do create a much more unique game each time, which is great for the game. It had a lot of repeat games over and over. Nothing new to, ""spice it up"" or add to the game. Now, giving players full control over the settings for how many people can get a role and at was percent people will get them is just stupid. Personally, a good even overall game would consist of at least one of each role at 100% or two of each at like 80%. That's my preference though, everyone plays differently. I know. 

Beware of fan-cam campy. These player(s) will sit on the security cameras about 80%-90% of the game and then complain when we haven't won the game on tasks yet. Just play the game around them and try your best, i's tuff at first but you get used to not being able to kill literally anyone when you're an impostor because people always stalking on cams. 

Lastly, after you figure out how the game works and how the average player plays the game, it does get very enjoyable; even with randoms. You do also begin to become a pro among us player well on your way towards the League of Sussies (LoS)."
16650,Very good game with Free chat! i understand that kids are playing this but you have censor chat why have quick chat when you have censors?

16708,"About 20 hours in, I was almost never the Impostor, even tho I got vented most of the time. Then I got to play Imp about 7-11 games in a row and through a series of gruesome backstabbing and manipulation most vile, I won near all of em. However, the consequence of this was nobody ever believing a damn word that left my mouth ever again and, just like George Bush preemptively invading Iraq, my ass got preemptively vented every game since - just to be sure. Twas a small price to pay for exacting much needed vengeance. The rest of the hours I logged in were spent revelling in poignant masochism and sadistic joy. 

The game might induce psychosis but, besides being good fun, it is also a great tool for self-reflection and a good tutorial for becoming a politician. No ragrets, I r8 8/8, would decieve again."

16731,"I once loved this game. I have almost 793 hours on record playing it, and that is just on my PC.

Now, however, I am incredibly disappointed. The constant server issues have made the game nearly unplayable. Server issues are to be expected, and they have happened before. We as players were understanding before, we cared about the struggles Innersloth, a once even smaller team of people, were having... because they were transparent and communicative with us when issues were happening. Now, pushing out new features and microtransactions is a priority, and the issues with the servers go unmentioned. Their social media team now only ever responds to positive feedback, but when the community is showing them the repetitive evidence of fundamental issues in the game, they go ignored. 

Don't spend money on this game, even if it is only $5. They no longer care if their game is playable. They only care about how much money they can receive off microtransactions."

16852,"Simple yet reasonably good fun, riding on a great cross-platform experience and population. Join a random group and you take in the biggest clinical trial/experiment out to prove how poorly evolution has treated you.

That's why this game is played best with friends - or at least the seemingly disparate folks who are on the same wavelength of stupidity.

*** Despite a great game, this game is untapped mine of potential - voice chats,  curated matches,  so many other modes of fun play.

Golden rays of the glorious susshine

To the shadows – out of sus

Arid breeze blows across the mountains
Giving flight to the birds of sus
In the distance machines come
To transform Eden – day by day

Only sus is with us now
Something warm and sus
Violence breeds within ourselves
No need for a sus

When the wind is slow
And the fire’s sus
The vulture waits to see what's sus
Oh how pretty

16906,"I played Among Us before it got popularised in 2020, to be honest it was worse back then. You had to pay for the other maps(this was before Airship btw) so Skeld was your only option. Not a bad map(trust me Mira HQ is worse) but having to pay for variety wasn't fun. Cosmetics weren't as good back then either.

Nowadays we have 4 free maps and cosmetics for days, also a progression system which makes well progressing fun. It gives you something to strive for and stuff. At it's core, Among Us is a fun social deduction game with a unique artstyle and balanced gameplay(if you wish it to be).

16987,"A perfect example of how the over-popularisation of a game can change it's status from being a relatively okay indie game, to a hated meme that we can't exterminate no matter how hard we try. If you have a few spare bucks, don't waste them on this game like I did. Instead, use those few spare bucks to save up for a game that isn't a walking meme no one finds funny anymore."

17069,"forget about friends telling you to quit among us, never quit be brave be strong as crewmate's or impostors, Legends never quit."
17070,"so here's the setting for the scene:

me. my best friend. chatting on discord and playing with some randomly matched ppl online. we don't tell each other our roles obviously cus we don't want to throw a game or make it less fun but we just like hanging out while we play online.
so we get matched in a pretty full game, like 10-15 ppl, and my name in-game is Chucky Ray (yknow. like the horror movie doll) and theirs is 'seedochuck' (yknow. like the horror movie doll's kid). i am made one of the imposters. i do not tell them this and i am picking people off when they arent looking.

chat eventually gets suspicious of me. i feign innocence to the point of silly ignorance just because i'm trying to get anyone to realize what our usernames are a reference to LOL, so i just keep going 'i would never kill anyone, it can't be me. i'm a good guy.' and my friend unknowingly helps by being like 'yeah i trust Chucky' so i dont get majority voted out.

it gets to a point where the other imposter has been found but i'm still eliminating ppl slowly. the pink player finally starts to seriously doubt that i'm innocent and calls me out on pretending im not the imposter by sounding over-innocent every round in the chat. theres only like one or two other ppl besides them and me and my friend at this point. one more time i say 'no, it's not me. i'd never hurt anyone.' and my friend says 'i believe Chucky hes telling the truth'. i say 'it must be you, pink, since you've accused me so hard and it's obviously not me'. they get upset because people start voting and say 'you're all stupid' in the chat. voting finishes. they have been voted out

'[pink player] is not an imposter'

i immediately run towards the closest innocent and wait for my cooldown to reset and kill them, leaving the crewmates outnumbered against me. 

'VICTORY' with 'Chucky Ray' front and center as the sole imposter and my ghost teammate next to me is on the screen. me and my friend start cracking up from laughter in the discord call because they also didn't know it was genuinely me until that moment.

among us is a very good game. 

also sometimes when i make my name TiffanyRay instead people think im a middle aged mom and are more polite to me. love that."
17071,Great game in its prime and is still fun tho none of my friends play it
17072,sussy
17073,Filled with mentally disabled children whose parents are most likely brother and sister thinking they're smart cause their brother-father who isn't allowed within 100 feet of a school tells them who the impostor is after he gets killed.
17074,used to be a great game now wth are those in app purchases? the point of amogus is that sussy imposter go murderlize crewmates. but then in app purchases come in like and legit steal peoples money. i wish they didnt ever change the way the game was played and kept it from turning into default mobile game :c

17109,"Among Us

Score: 8/10
Pros: Lets be honest, most people who dislike the game want to dislike more for the fandom and because it's popular. It's not a bad game. Its simple, easy to pick up and drop, you walk around do your tasks, while hunters hunt you and your team has to figure it out. You can be manipulative in order to get innocents tossed out, you can just be brutal as long as you are sneaky. It's a super clean game and its understandable why it became so big.
Cons:  It may be a bit too simple, as it is just small micro puzzles and busy work while the imposter kills people, making repeat playthroughs high burn out potential.
Recommend to: Younger people, those who want a good party game that can entertain for maybe a week or so, or people who like super casual games.
Overall: Right time, right place, right attitude, the devs got lightning in a bottle."

17215,"This happened to my buddy Sarjeen. Our friendship was going well for some time but there came a point where he always vented to me (i think he felt comfortable venting in front of me). I didn't think much of it at the time but then one day I was bored and I was snooping around looking at the games my friends have been playing and I stumbled upon Sarjeen's hours spent playing among us. This got me feeling sus of our friendship, questions like ""could I trust this man?"" started to pop up in my head. I think I was even gaslighting myself to think that Sarj wasn't an imposter because I really wanted to believe that he was my good friend. As time went on I had my sus alarm tingling but i decided to ignore it. Sarjeen continued to vent in front of me and I didnt think much of it at the time until one day while we were walking around in a mall and he suddenly vented into an actual vent which sent red alarm bells rings in my head. At this moment I knew something was seriously wrong and I knew he would eventually backstab me and ruin the trust and friendship we've built over the years. So I did what I did and I went to his twitter account and reported him as ""suspicious"". 

Here's a tip in life: if you wanna know if you can trust a person then make sure to check the hours they spent on Among Us. It can save you from a potential heartbreak."

ඞ AMOGUS.  Ok, I know this game is a giant meme at this point and has mostly fallen out of relevancy, but I still really like it.  Mostly, I have fun messing with people in public lobbies with friends and just doing dumb role-plays and stuff.  The devs are regularly updating the game even though it has ridden out it's popular surge, and I respect the hell out of that.  Support the devs of this game, they rock.

Has taken up a weird place in pop culture right now, especially with the younger audience, but it is still a good experience if you're in a lobby with friends. 

(Keep in mind, much like Mariokart and Monopoly this will make you distrust or hate your friends for a while after playing)

game is not supported, but is full of bugs.|
community is irreversibly toxic and the devs ignore this as 'this is a raw intro version of the gamel||

oh oh, what great clowns are you?"

Develop trust issues and also be the cause of it."

17323,Its good but sometimes it dosen't let me play
17324,"for centuries, humanity has wondered who is among us, who could be among us...I htink we will perhaps soon know the answers to that very question!! Psychologically, among us is to be studied and understood as a case history of the human mind,but mayhaps one giving more questions than answers? 

while among us may  make us sus, it can maybe also help us learn to trust...learn to love....
 
just a thought!!! I would reccomend the game

music 8/10
gameplay 9/10
story 5/10
overall 8/10"

17327,"It's fun for a few hours but then it get's boring, the only reason I have this on my account is because my brother loves it."
17328,I hate this game.

17330,"Amazing game,  I play it with friends from work, and have a blast. 10/10"
17331,"Back when this game became first popular, it was an incredibly fun game. Me and my friends enjoyed it. But, I stopped playing it for a long time from losing interest. But recently my friends started to play it again so I thought I'd reinstall and give it a go. I knew it had a bunch of updates and I was excited, but what do I get? Yeah, a-fucking-parrently for some god damn reason, the game thinks I'm 1 year old. I guess I missed an update that had you pick an age the first time you launch the game, so since I never did pick an age, it defaulted to the lowest it could go. And guess what? There's no changing this. I looked all across the internet and there used to be a fix, but then that fix got patched out. So now whenever I try to make an account, it asks me for my parents email, and so I put in my email and make ""my child"" an account. But even after that, and giving the account all fucking permissions, I still can't turn on free-chat! WHICH MEANS I CAN'T FUCKING PLAY IN ANY LOBBY THAT'S NOT QUICK-CHAT. HOW FUCKING LOVELY IS THAT? I LITERALLY CAN'T PLAY THE GAME ANYMORE. THERE IS NO FIX. AND NOT ONLY THAT, THIS ASSHOLE SUSPICIOUS AF STUDIO WANTED EITHER MY CREDIT CARD OR SOCIAL SECURITY INFO JUST TO MAKE THAT ACCOUNT. YEAH I TOTALLY BET THEY AREN'T PAWNING THAT REALLY FUCKING SENSITIVE INFO TO SOME BLACK MARKET SHIT. This game has fallen. What used to be a small labor of love became something utterly disgusting. Never playing this again. Because I don't have a choice. Thanks."

17343,"No.. Waste of life, time, effort, and everything ever... i'd rather die than play this game, but life led me back to this shithole full of sussy susser imposters"
17344,"You're able to play online with other randoms and use a text function within the game to figure out who the enemy is among the group. However, the experience is more enjoyable when you're able to have the conversation through voice chat, like discord. Game updates are pretty few and far between, but overall I would highly recommend Among Us."
17345,haha funny sus game
17346,Among us is a cool game with a lot of features with 6 rolls and a ton of game play
17347,good

17349,"prepare for anger, betrayal and disappointment. InnerSloth has reached a new seemingly unreachable level of narrative design. among us will hurt you in ways that no game has ever done before. this is a game you must experience"
17350,"Please fix the game. We keep getting disconnected during our game and get 5000 ping, and the Polus Cube is very bugged. You can not buy certain items in the tree."

17360,"I tried to play on another PC, accidentally submitted wrong date, now the game thinks I'm 1 year old child and wants my credit card information to let me play private games with friends.
How many one year olds play this game? Why is there no option to change your age?

17364,"One of my favourite games!! Its fun, involes mystery,puzzle solving and loads more. i think that its a great game to play of your bored or stuck at home. the aim is to try complete tasks and vote out the imposter, how ever if you are the imposter the aim is to kill all the crewmates and make exuses and coinfusion so you dont get voted out. You can also cuztomize your character with amzing colours, so many different types of hats and even outfits! I highly recommend it."

17374,"After some recent update, the game asks your date of birth. I put my date of birth (1998) but still for some reason the game read that my age is 0 years old. Now I can't sign in without Guardians email. I put my email as the guardian email just to find out that I need to send a picture of my ID or credit card etc. to prove I am old enough. You can't bypass this even by reinstalling or editing local files manually. 
You can still play as a guest, but this gives you limited options like you can't choose your name or join games with free chat. I played this game already for years with my steam name and full features.
As a Unity game developer myself, this is completely unacceptable."

17403,"I really like this game. It's extremely fun..But. It has been having the same glitch for months where every game or two it ""fails to sign you in to the server"" and requests you go to Guest account, but It doesn't work and you aren't allowed to play the game or join any servers randomly for 2 to 15ish minutes randomly, and this hasn't been fixed in ages. And there needs to be regulations on the amount of sexual lobbies. One every 4 lobbies is a sex roleplay group, and the majority of the players on this game are under 18, if even 15. And there's alot of lobbies made by pedophiles trying to engage with minors specifically and there needs to be some kind of prevention to have lewd usernames/lobbies at least, and/or add a 18+ only section? I really hope they fix this, because otherwise, this is a awesome game, and the art is soo cute! And the mechanics are so intricate and interesting."

17437,"Among Us is far too good at luring you in with cute bean astronauts who sometimes murder their friends and making you sink hours at a time with it, and I do mean that in the best way. It's been a great game when I've been struggling to fall asleep, or when I have a bit of time before something, and it's so addicting. Completing tasks as a crewmate is just fun, and killing all your friends as an impostor is cool too (on the very rare chance I ever played it; my luck is dreadful), and I think it's a sign of excellent game design that I can say both roles are equally enjoyable. Hunting the achievements took a whole lot of playing, but I have no complaints. This was my introduction to the social deduction genre, but I had so much fun with this, that now I want to look for more. At how much I've played this game, and how inexpensive it was, it's an easy recommendation from me for anyone."

1. The game needs more maps more roles and more cosmetics.

3. There needs to be a longer and immediate punishment for intentional disconnects, Tons of people leave the game as soon as they find out they aren't the imp. 
4. They REALLY need to fix the blackscreen issue i have friends who play on Console who get a blackscreen upon start of the match so they cannot even play have had it happen to myself 3 times so far.

17485,Very cool
17486,"Among Us is the most comprehensive, significant and extraordinary game that I have ever taken part in. It is a masterclass of the survival and multiplayer party game genre. The story that this game tells is incredible and it tells it through its non verbal dialogue and creative imagery. It creates a message that very few pieces of media have managed to achieve. The game also has many characters (such as the red imposter and the blue crewmate) with many different personality traits and backstorys that makes every character distinct and memorable. I am honestly astounded by the amount of influence this game has had on the younger generation. I see a lot of young people with their sus hoodies and imposter tracksuits. It inspires me to become a sus influencer and has created the path I want to go down in life (among us gamer). If you for some reason do not appreciate the masterpiece that is Among Us, I really recommend you to drive off the nearest cliff. Thank you Innersloth for creating this game, as I would have no purpose in life without it."

17582,"Among Us is a good game. It is especially fun with friends. The game has good Easter Eggs. Gameplay is smooth. Maps, roles, cosmetic items and tasks are nice. However, I think the role of the ghost should be improved. Many players leave the game because there is not much to do when you are a ghost. Also, some people who play this game are not very nice. Adults and younger players should remember that they are talking to another person. Still the game has a good price to quality ratio.

17598,"The game is good and fun among friends, but the support is terrible. I bought a DLC for my account that worked at the time, but I had to format the computer and when I downloaded it again, through steam (where my account and DLC were saved), everything disappeared. I've been trying to contact support for 3 months now and they always tell me to wait, wait and wait. I got tired of waiting, unfortunately I will have to take legal action. I can't recommend a game that gives you a headache to solve a simple problem!"
17599,no because the impostor isnt sus enough
17600,worst
17601,"decent game, ruined by the community"
17602,"Cheap and fun game to play with friends, there isn't a single gen Z that doesn't know this game. It's kind of dead unfortunately but it filled the boredom of quarantine for anyone with a computer/phone and a couple of friends."
17603,that guardian verification is total bs
17604,its good game but need more roles or mods to be fun
17605,"Join a Discord Server and it is a TON of fun. If you don't have a headset, get one!"
17606,it gets boring after one match
17607,guys cyan was just sleeping in cams i didn't kill him i swear
17608,"I like the game. The only gripe I have is that teamers/friends make it painfully obvious and unfun to play. My first round I joined rooms that had no regular chat just those bubbles you click on for pre-made chat messages and I got murderer and was very careful and even faked tasks, ran by people several times and avoided them like a normal one, killed someone when I was positive no one else was around ran off, and 30 seconds later all of them are voting me out with no communication. So yeah, that's about what you have to look forward to. 

When I played this with friends we didn't see any fun in just telling each other who it is so we kept it to ourselves when it happened lol. We'd just scream over discord and say things like ""I died haha"" with the occasional ""WHO IS IT"" and ""FIGURE IT OUT BWHAHAHA"".

Now that was funner than having no scare."
17609,Amogus
17610,"I've broken friendships, I've ruined lives, I've cussed out so many people for voting me off even if I was the impostor. Amazing. The ONLY game to be honest. I love that we only have one big bone too, funni hats are a great way to take my money because I have no self control. 10/10 I'm obsessed"

17617,"I have 48 hours in this game. I just got a new computer, and when it had me enter my age, I accidentally selected 2022 for my birth year. Now it won't let me access my account without providing my SSN to prove that I am an adult. I've tried everything. I edited the file so that it said a older year. I deleted all of the files in the cache. Nothing works. Fuck you Innersloth, I am NOT giving you my SSN."

17668,"This game is alright, but the fucking parental verification is awful. You either pay them a dollar or give your social security number, which sounds scammy as hell. There's no way to bypass it if you've seen it once; your computer (and possibly your steam files) are tainted at that point. Were the Innersloth devs held at gunpoint to put this crap in, or are they just terrible people? Probably the latter."

17699,"Gameplay: It's very fun and suspenseful especially when you play it with family and friends. The roles make the game more enjoyable (From 1-5 i rate it a 5)

Audio: I like the audio. It sounds very clear and it's like you are really in the game. (From 1-5 i rate it a 5)

Visuals: The game looks nice. The animation of the crewmates look adorable and the maps look cool. (From 1-5 i rate it a 5)

Lore/Concept: There's no lore in the game. But i like the concept of aliens trying to sabotage the ship and kill everyone. (From 1-5 i rate it a 4)

Bug Fixes: Too many bugs. There's one bug where you can't press anything on screen not even chat or settings and another bug where if you're the impostor you can't kill anyone for some reason. (From 1-5 i rate it a 3)

Overall: Fun game to play with family and friends and can be very interesting to people that like mystery, social deduction and suspense. But the game requires more bug fixes"

17704,"This game is fun once and a while with a large group of friends. The game itself is fun, but my god some of the players.

Playing in public lobbies is not all that fun. Between people cheating by having friends ""shield"" the impostor, and a few times I have seen impostors hack the kill cool down mid game, it gets old very quickly. There are times where it feels like not a single person in the lobby is trying to think out what's happening, and people just start voting random people off for no reason."
17705,this bad
17706,"i love among us, it's an amazing representation of human life."

17708,sussy sus sus sus su- suuuuuuuuuuuus SSSSSSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSYYY AMOGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUS
17709,"Still one of the best game in years, and damn that it's amazing. I admit that the cosmicube update worried me, since MTX are naturally bad, but until now they have kept it okayish.

Just wish that the crew quitters and trolls could be blocked more easily."
17710,Among Us
17711,yes
17712,amogus
17713,"Leaving a review for Among Us is a very difficult task due to the sheer popularity of this game & how much of a meme it has become.

However, leaving the funny behind Among Us can be extremely fun to play with friends, as long as you have enough of them... To truly enjoy this game you will need at least 8 or more friends as games will be far too short, predictable & boring if there are less than that & if you think you can fill it up with random players online, well good luck to you.

There are obvious flaws to this game such as the fact having fun usually relies on the other players in the game to be invested & to not spoil the game for everyone else. Also, some bugs with tasks can ruin the game as completing all tasks becomes impossible & removes that entire aspect of the game.

Due to the fact playing this game properly is a difficult task as you need 8 or 9 people to be available at once & the fact the game can become stale after many hours of play, I give it a 4/10.

Unless you've got a big group of friends, then that bumps it up to about a 6/10."
17714,fun game for all ages
17715,"Among Us really provides a way to really question what you notice. The game features you and several others doing tasks and 'among you' is a imposter who is killing you and your crewmates. The game, in short, is really fun, and especially with friends, incredibly hilarious. 

This is one of the few online titles i play, and there's a reason why. It's just dumb fun. Both modes are really fun and engaging, and if you're a imposter or cremate, you're on your toes trying to make sure you win. I'd recommend it."
17716,"I do not write reviews for video games, but this one is quite special. I have replayed this game a dozen times, and each time I revisit the cold depths of Among Us's oceans, I feel a sense of revamped adventure that I can't describe, and no other game can pull out of me. Experience this game in its entirety, every nook a cranny has something beautiful within it.

17781,"Legitimately, Among Us is a super fun game. If you played in the early days, I can understand why it may be boring to think about now but they've added a lot to it. There's four maps now, way more customization, and there's a variety of different roles crew members and imp can have. Imps can be shapeshifters now or crew can have roles like scientist to check on vitals/engineer to also use vents w/o being imp.

I think it's way fun now and I've enjoyed playing it. Twenty hours later, I still don't have 50/150 kill achievement or 500 tasks done but the grind is alright for a game I like. I don't think trolling happens in servers nearly as often as you think. 10/10 would sus again.

All that needed to happen was to get the game, open it, create a lobby, and play. Now you need to create an account, make sure everybody's settings are exactly the same, and (I kid you not) GIVE THEM YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER OR CREDIT CARD INFO! I get that the developers don't want to introduce children to horrible people, but like hell if I'm giving anybody my SSN except for my employer, insurance company, or bank.

17829,"PSA: There is a bug that you literally CANNOT play the game with. Gives you an 'Unknown error has diconnected you from the server' bug and does not allow you to play online or offline. 
The only workaround this bug, was guest accounts. Those have been removed.

I cannot recommend a game that has an unplayable bug in it, no matter how fun the game is.
Also, customer support is a joke. I've been in discussion with them since April 21st. They still don't know what's wrong."
17830,"I like the game alot. i have not played it in like years, months, i dont know but theres new roles, pets or whatever, i find it cool that they also added free chat back."

17836,this is the sussiest game ever pro gaem
17837,very suspisuous good sus game
17838,"Update: this game is mostly unplayable with random lobbies. 

disclaimer:
There's many hackers that ruin matches. 
There's many people at differing skill levels. Ranging from 8 year olds just playing for fun, to adults trolling for giggles. 
The game has a few glitches. Current ones: Being unable to use any of the buttons. Impostors sometimes only face one direction. 
There's also groups that will gang up on you and you simply stand no chance of winning. The downsides are plenty. 

If you can get past that, the game is pretty fun. 
It's better played with other friends, but you can certainly play alone as well, just be aware of the disclaimer, you'll encounter more weirdos.

edit: from time to time i consider updating this review. 
The i try to play a normal game and cannot find a single one and am reminded to keep this review as is."
17839,"Among Us is a great game, the big problem is people dont play it properly, if you are in a private lobby with friends you'll have a great time, if you join strangers in a random lobby expect the host to bias the lobby in favour of the imps, 60% of the crew to not do tasks, 3 people to leave because they didnt get an imp game. I think many of these problems can be solved by the devs."

17851,"Keep lagging with Win11 system and 140W RTX3060, what's the problem? 
Tried reinstall 3060 driver and optimize the game by Geforce but nothing changes at all the game still lagging so badly. Obviously it can never be about hardware problem since my laptop can run all other games like ApexLegends smoothly with highest video quality. Don't have idea about how to deal with this issue even now, can't play it at all. FIX THE GAME WITH WIN 11."

17981,"After the dev team made a few major updates, they messed up the entire game, all of the DLC i  purchased on steam isn't pliable to the game itself anymore, you have to buy the game packs AGAIN with their in-game currency, and it costs even more real money to get the currency. I do not recommend this game because it is absolutely complicated."

18252,"Despite the memes, Amomagus-suso-baka is a genuinely good game. It's simple, and yet that's part of it's charm. It's no surprise that the developers of Henry Stickmin know how to make a good game, but they really managed to hit the nail on the head here. And it seems they're also paying some attention to the community, what with the addition of new roles and such. Sure, the game has flaws, but they are (in my opinion) minimal and have little (if any) impact on one's gameplay experience. The community might be a little off-putting at times, but that's the case with most widely-popular game communities (especially after they start to settle in to their niche on the internet); overall, people are pretty ok, and honestly this is a game better played with friends anyway.

18311,"The age verification system from a recent update is bugged and insists that a 30+ year old needs parental permission to play this game.  Uninstalling/reinstall and clearing app data make no difference. With data breaches happening all the time there is no way I'm giving my CC# or SSN to a company that I have no business transaction with. 

It is mind-blowing that developers think it is acceptable to try and extort their customers' personal information to play a product that they've paid for.  It would be one thing if that was their policy from the start, but this is a change that was made well outside the 2 hours/6 months Steam refund term which leaves me essentially zero recourse.

It is a fun game, but the devs need find a way to protect children without exposing their customers to risk of identity theft.  It shouldn't be hard, literally millions of other games managed to do it."

18338,"Concerned parent here. This game has tore my family apart. My son has committed 3 CRIMES after playing this game. Those 3 crimes have all been murder. He says that he needs to be ""sus"" and is the ""impostor"". My son KILLED my husband and told me that I can't ""report"" the body other wise the other crewmates will think he is ""sus"" and that he would be ""ejected"". This game has completely corrupted my son, he would of never done ANYTHING like this before playing this game. I am so dissapointed that this game is still on the store. It is making kids the ""impostor"" and they are literally committing crimes. Why is this still up?"

Part 1.

“IM READY ♥♥♥♥ ME ♥♥♥♥ ME ♥♥♥♥ ME ♥♥♥♥ ME PLEASE DADDY IMPOSTER”
I was so close to feeling the imposters sweet ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ the ♥♥♥♥ out of me 🤤 but then my NAZI RACIST mother came in and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. 😔😒🙁☹️

Little did I know they request your age and if you click through that it sets your age at 1 years old. Now my account is age locked and there's no information on how to remove it. I can't even play the game, they are requesting my social Security number to access the game. This is completely unacceptable. Why would they even let you play this game at 1 years old? The windowed mode it extremely bad as well. Until I find away to fix this the game is useless to me. I want my money back. I would not recommend this game. Go play town of salem it's better."

18491,"I like playing as Crewmate more than Impostor. Am I possibly an alien from space who hates the harmful stereotype? No, it's true, I just think murder is too messy to bother with. That's why I instead troll people on the internet.

I mostly play for Hide'N'Seek or enter the AdultOnly titled lobbies. I know masterful little trick, if you want to get kicked, just say ""Start"" somewhere in your sentence and it will send the lobbiest into blind rage, it's magical. 
I also love just, roleplaying into the ground. I sometimes call myself Cheeseller and start acting like a pushy cheese salesman. 
Worth the 0 times I've vented as Engineer and not got called Impostor, proving to me that stereotype is a lie and internet guides are just repeating everything they heard from their ""I got a double kill once"" friend."

My girlfriend is not happy. Anyway, trying to get all my friends to play so we can have a game night of Among us. We're board game fanatics but I might be able to convert them a little."

18544,"My SUSSY POWERS ARE AWAKENING 😱😎
Part 1. I just did my daily jackoff ☺️ to my impostor body pillow, 😱 but when I came, 👻 I started floating, 😱 and think I got teleported into the skeld. 😮 I swear for a second I felt the imposter's strong hands grip my asscheeks.🤤 🍑 🍑 I immediately was transported back to earth, 😭 and I instantly got on all fours on my bed naked, 🤪 as you would, and started screaming in my best efforts to summon the imposter 💪
“IM READY FUCK ME FUCK ME FUCK ME FUCK ME PLEASE DADDY IMPOSTER”
I was so close to feeling the imposters sweet cock fuck the shit out of me 🤤 but then my NAZI RACIST mother came in and beat the shit out of me. 😔😒🙁☹️
She then said I was going to a magical place called the “mental asylum” 🤔 I’m not too sure where that dimension is located but it sounds EPIC 😮"

18600,"Among Us is a ""Social Detection Game"" that is a clever and cautionary lesson in how both Jury Duty and Democratic Elections are unsustainable and prone to failure.

At worst it is a tideous ""[insert colour] sus"" spam without any reasons given."

There is a channel for reporting bugs on the official Discord server. I believe that many of them will go up and report those glitches. I don't recommend this game until these glitches are fixed."

the imposters main role is to kill all crewmates and not get caught.

The smaller roles are things like gaurdian angel, and things like a shapeshifter (e,t,c)
 the gaurdian angel is the first dead crewmate, and their role is to protect the players with their wings, just time it right! 
the shapeshifter can shapeshift into a crewmate and create sussing threw out everyone.
but, these things are optional."

18752,"the players of this game have little to no critical thinking skills and take this game far less seriously than hoped, it is not the sophisticated debate of innocence and guilt i had been looking for in games but instead a cesspool of morons saying idiotic ""memes"" to each other such as ""red sus"" and other such phrases. i had hoped this would be a game about a structured debate about who is the killer and who is innocent but rather it is a game filled with children and morons saying someone is ""sus"", which i assume is there moronic way of saying ""suspicious"", with no evidence or actual rebuttal or point from either side. it's a gamble who get's voted out and who stays, it's not about any evidence or actual debate but rather who's the loudest and most obnoxious in there cowardly finger pointing, then when i actually try making a decent point and/or rebuttal against someone else i'm called ""sus"" and voted out. when i get the imposter i can't even kill one person because either someone immediately calls an emergency meeting and votes me out or i kill someone and someone spots me immediately and votes me out. 

In conclusion i think among us is only enjoyable by children, morons, and other idiotic members of our society, i would not recommend this game to anyone unless i was trying to drive them to a state of insanity, goodday"

18764,Was taken in by the hype and peer-pressured into playing this game. I am still asking myself why I paid money for it when it's available for free on mobile devices.
18765,"Fun little game of sabotage to play with friends, the game does grow a bit boring after a while as it only had three maps that you played. This is fun to pick up and play for an hour or so when you have a group of friends and just do not have time to really delve into things (This was normally the game of choice for my group of 8 to 10 people when we did not play our MMORPG or did not have the people to do content.)

The game is simplistic in itself where your goal is either to sabotage the other members and 'murder' them to win the game, or for you to find out and do all your tasks while figuring out who is X'ing off your crew. A basic 'whoddunit' which can lead up to a lot of laughs, you need to be a bit of a BSer to get yourself out of trouble. The vent escapes for the imposters is a neat addition for these players to move through the maps and think of a quick escape when coming up to a hapless individual doing a task. 

Fun times, but nothing to drain hours upon like some people have done. I believe that there is a mod community that adds a lot more depth to the game but as the stock, it's a fun game to play on bored days."

18870,"To whom it may concern, in this virtual letter one should fine my honest opinion upon this gracious game.

Allow me to set the stage as it were...
Within the confines of a world damned with disease, when the populace was at what was then the lowest of lows. This game dawned upon the horizon, not in the form of a knight in shining armour, nor that of which the mind might conceive as a hero. It took the form of a tiny red Mike and Ike. Whose form was akin to the astronauts of recent memory, alas not all of these Mike and Ike's are good. 

Much like a box of Mike and Ike's that's been sitting in the back of an abandoned theatre since the 1900s. These little (insert curse word here) can kill. And they excel at it.

One must be wary when working with these (insert curse word here). They lie, they'll stab you in the back and take your life insurance. 

But this game reminds me of the real world, no matter how sweet one may appear. Thanks to American capitalism, and a society driven upon the preservation of food, you never know if they are as rotten as a Mike and Ike from the 1900s. 

This virtual letter shall draw to a close here, I do enjoy this game. I recommended it.

Yours truly,

~A confused person in a very confusing world"

19001,"This game is super fun to play with friends but sadly there a ton of 18+ servers (which I'm pretty sure aren't allowed) and the players in general are either trolls or degenerates. I couldn't seem to find a good server, you might. If you're wanting to to let you kid play this make sure to change the settings to make it safe for them to play."
19002,just STOP
19003,I think that among is very different than most games and allows you to really get into a mystery more than other games although some people do not like this mechanic and just go and play to make others mad.

On the off chance someone is reading this and hasn't played among us I'm not gonna waste your time with a huge paragraph, is it worth it? Yes if you have friends who are also wanting to play it, in short lobbys nowadays are full of people in discord or party chat making the game feel impossible solo, so either fight fire with fire or have a blast in a private lobby with mates. Cheap too so not much of a loss."

19089,"Among us is a very accessible and cheap game.
Fun and simple to learn, you'll have a good understanding of how everything works after just a few matches.
That's because the game's complexity stems from the discussion rather than the mechanics.
Among Us teaches us valuable lessons:
Trust no one
QUESTION EVERYTHING"
19090,"Fun
"
19091,I decided to play again just for fun and my DLC's are useless now i want my pets back or my money scummy game
19092,"So, last Sunday my parents made me go to church ,which made me really mad because my parents don't let me play Among Us in church.

We took our seats and the priest was up front talking about ""salvation"" and ""holiness"" or whatever. Same thing as last week.

But then, he said something that really caught me off guard. He spoke of a man who goes by the name of ""Jesus.""

""Jesus.""

""JeSUS.""

No way. I could not believe what I was hearing.

Endorphins were rushing to my brain and my body began to shiver as I let out a quiet moan.

If you didn't catch on by now, the word ""Jesus"" has ""SUS"" in it, which is a reference to the popular video game ""Among Us.""

""WHEN THE IMPOSTER IS SUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""

I screamed louder than I ever have in my life. My words echoed throughout the room for five seconds before fading into complete silence.

Everyone was staring at me as I had a huge grin on my face, perfectly replicating the face from the ""when the imposter is sus"" meme (Google it if you don't know what it is.)

They all had this look on their faces as if I had just slaughtered 7,924 Afghanian children.

""Why do you all have that look on your faces? Did someone do a Fortnite dance?""

And there was still complete silence. I actually had to make sure I wasn't wearing my noise cancelling headphones that I always wear while playing Among Us. I could not believe that not one person in the room was dying of laughter!!

""Young man, please be quiet"" said the priest.

He was literally the one who made the Among Us reference in the first place. What's his problem?

""THAT'S NOT VERY WHOLESOME!!!!!!!!!!""

This guy was definitely the imposter. There's no way he couldn't be.

I Naruto ran faster than anyone has ever Naruto ran before. Even Naruto himself would be proud of me.

As I was making my way up to the imposter, the security guard was chasing after me!

I had to think fast.

After being chased around the room for two minutes, I hastily undid my pants and peed in the security guard's eyes. As he was being blinded by my pee, he was stumbling around and bumped into the wall very hard.

A crucifix fell off the wall and impaled his stupid, ugly fat head. He fell and a pool of blood soon formed around him.

Everyone in the church was screaming and running out the door. I slammed my hand down on the crucifix, replicating the button you press in Among Us, which drove the crucifix further into his skull.

""EMERGENCY MEETING!!!!!!!!!!!""

No one laughed. They were too busy screaming to notice. Whatever.

I stripped completely naked and went up to the priest. I replicated the Big Chungus pose with 100% accuracy.

""You probably don't even use Reddit. That's not very keanu chungus wholesome 100 of you. Go subscribe to r/atheism.""

The priest had a look of shock on his face when I said that. The kind of face one would make if they caught their beloved child playing Fortnite.

He held a cross in front of himself and started talking about ""possession"" and ""demons."" He obviously doesn't know how to play Among Us so naturally, I felt bad for him.

But he was still the imposter.

I grabbed him and threw him across the church, sending him crashing through the window and slammed against the street outside. A car ran over his head, causing his brain and skull fragments to splatter everywhere.

Then, I heard sirens and a helicopter flying around above the church. I went upstairs to the roof to check out what was going on.

""This is the police! Get down from the roof now or we will shoot!""

This guy is so sus, let me tell ya.

Obviously, I was not going to listen to an imposter so I was Naruto running around the roof. Bullets from the helicopter were raining down from above but none of them hit me since I was Naruto running so fast.

""Dammit, I can't hit him!""

I knew I had him beat then.

So, I pulled out my gun (I always keep a glock in my foreskin so I can pull the Among Us death animation when I lose my virginity because I know it makes girls horny.)

I shot at the helicopter and it started spinning out of control and crashed into the front of the church, causing a huge explosion.

The roof started sliding off from the building, which landed on the cop cars and killed 8 cops. This also flung me into the street and I broke my foot, which was very sus.

I limped all the way to the woods where I am now hiding and writing this. I will update as soon as I can but I need to get out of here soon because I can hear people looking for me."

19198,"You already know what Among Us is, you don't need to see reviews for that, but let me say this:
Sure you can play vanilla, but I'd recommend playing with mods like Town of Us or your doing yourself a huge disservice. 
Obviously you will need to find friends or join discord servers to find people to play with but try it. 
All you need to do is add some files from GitHub into the game folder (Program Files (x86) → Steam → steamapps → common → Among Us) and load up the game.
With the newest update some mods might not work properly, so do a bit of research before you randomly download anything from the internet. Should go without saying, but yeah.
I too thought that mods were complicated and out of reach but it really is that easy. 
I hope InnerSloth (continues to) embrace mods and allow that community to flourish because some of the mods really are something special."

19248,"Before I begin my actual review, I would like to apologize in advance for my inadequate level of English proficiency. I am not a native speaker of the world's current lingua franca which unfortunately leads to me making numerous embarrassing mistakes being made whenever I attempt to communicate using this language. Whenever I am reminded of how I lack the ability to convey my thoughts in an eloquent manner, I feel as though I have committed a cardinal sin, as though every English teacher in the world is simultaneously shaking their head and sighing due to how utterly disappointed they are at me.

Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect English, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor English (Also known informally as Grammar Nazis) from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder. In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate in their second or third languages eloquently. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they've written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate. To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn't fluent in English is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn't it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet.

That being said, I am aware that not all netizens who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow. However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with the English language. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online. Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via messaging privately because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I'm sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress. I know that I've written a bit of an essay, but I hope I've made my points clear.

Anyways, here is the review I wanted to make:

19253,"Although the hype and peak of Among Us is past, it still remains a fantastic social deduction game (especially when played with friends using voice). Among Us has recently begun updating the game to include roles which previously could only be found in mods and introducing a level system dramatically improving the enjoyability of the game and increasing its complexity. With future updates to come, there is a lot to look forward to and I believe its popularity may surpass it's previous high's again. All in all, a very enjoyable murder mystery / social deduction game that can be immensely fun especially when played with friends on a voice channel."

However, the game grows kind of repetitive after a while, with every round devolving into either ""Ha, Ha, I'm gonna do a big brain imposter strat"" or a shouting match between friends about who is more ""sus"". Fun while it lasted, but not a game built for longevity in my opinion."

19290,"First things first this review is not all positive i'm gonna be listing pros and cons and then a conclusion, i hope this is helpful to newcomers and anyone else!

Pros:
Free to play
ASSets ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
good variety of weapons
fun melee combat
funny bugs ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
beautiful graphics
AMAZING soundtrack
Fashion'n'stuff
tenno-gen (player made content put into the games market you can get)
2 open-worlds
Cinematic quests
nice community (except for a few...)



Cons:
GRIND
GRIND
GRIND
GRIND
BUILD TIMES
ANNOYING BUGS
getting banned from for saying things like Gay / Nezhas a trap and other stupid things
Nezha not being a grill ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Content droughts
basically no endgame
Hema research
nyx deluxe being on nyx
horrible chat moderation



Conclusion: Great game at first, the grind is bearable AT times, but it gets annoying for certain warframes and weapons.
but what lacks in is content and support for veteran players, i'm not that much of a vet but i'm close to it, and i also feel the lack of content for longer term players. Thats about it, its a good game but lack of content blah blah blah... just play the game slowly and dont rush through everything otherwise you will get bored, i hope DE will add actually good content fit for Veteran players in the future! have a nice day."

19315,"I would have given this a good review if the game didn't get ""solved."" I would've liked the game if people weren't tryhards who got mad about the game. I stopped playing because my friends started to become monsters when they were voted out when they weren't imposters, hurling insults at all of us."

19363,"Honesty... alright this game has its moments where it can be really fun but then you realize that the community can make it really not fun.. Maybe private lobbies can be enjoyable but overall I think that you just have to search around for some good folks (even though there might be that 1 that ruins it for everyone).  As long as you can deal with the trolls - you will enjoy this game.

Achievement Hunters: Find the lobbies for ShiftNSeek or HideNSeek designated by players names - these will be the easiest lobbies (as long as rules are followed) to get all the tasks or kills necessary. Other than that just play along and you will end up getting all of them."
19364,good
19365,This is not a game for children but adults should be slightly embarrassed if they are caught playing it alone.

19395,"Among Us is an absolute masterpiece of digital human craft. I'm on 2.2 hours now and can't put it down. I cannot simply put my judgement of this art into words. It's like if god himself decided to come down and bless the world with this game. When creating my steam account back in 2021, searching for games I would've never thought that I'd come across something this majestic. It was an instant purchase for me, However upon playing my pc struggled to handle it's gorgeous graphics which were unlike anything I'd never once laid my eyes on. I spent the next year working minimum wage to upgrade my pc in hopes I'd one day get to smoothly run this game. Whenever I felt down I would open my steam library and just stare at this game. It filled me with hope and determination knowing one day it would be mine. Eventually I had enough money; I emptied my savings and sold my left kidney to build a pc with dual RTX 3090s and a water-cooled i9 10900K. I was finally able to run this game at 720p, 60 fps. And I've been hooked ever since. Every day I look forward to experiencing this gem in my spare time and It's cured me of my depression. The gameplay is the greatest experience out there. No loot boxes, subscriptions, or pay to win. Just pure gaming.
"
19396,"Ever since this new update the game just isn't fun anymore.

They've added different roles that just make the game too complicated, letting crew-mates vent, guardian angels to protect certain crewmates, and some shape-shifter role or something.

I loved this game before they updated it, but I'm just going to have to make custom lobbies with friends."

Please don't fix the account system if you can't do it. After playing for so long, it's because you reinstall the computer, and then all the things are gone. The level and the love combination bag you bought before are gone. What's the use of the identification code? I left my ID and couldn't log in. It's easy to bind the cloud backup with steam.

Like reading people, understand what sort of ""tells"" a person has, as well as the obvious ones we're used to like memorising sections of gameplay, hand eye coordination etc. Gameplay can be simplistic if you're in public or random lobbies but using discord and having a good community of players makes a HUGE difference"

19448,"Operation Condor (Spanish: Operación Cóndor, also known as Plan Cóndor; Portuguese: Operação Condor) was a United States-backed campaign of political repression and state terror[9] involving intelligence operations and assassination of opponents. It was officially and formally implemented in November 1975 by the right-wing dictatorships of the Southern Cone of South America.[10]

Due to its clandestine nature, the precise number of deaths directly attributable to Operation Condor is highly disputed. Some estimates are that at least 60,000 deaths can be attributed to Condor,[7] roughly 30,000 of these in Argentina,[11][12] and the Archives of Terror list 50,000 killed, 30,000 disappeared and 400,000 imprisoned.[8][13] American political scientist J. Patrice McSherry gives a figure of at least 402 killed in Condor operations which crossed national borders in a 2002 source,[9] and mentions in a 2009 source that of those who ""had gone into exile"" and were ""kidnapped, tortured and killed in allied countries or illegally transferred to their home countries to be executed... hundreds, or thousands, of such persons—the number still has not been finally determined—were abducted, tortured, and murdered in Condor operations.""[1] Victims included dissidents and leftists, union and peasant leaders, priests and nuns, students and teachers, intellectuals and suspected guerrillas.[9] Although it was described by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as ""a cooperative effort by the intelligence/security services of several South American countries to combat terrorism and subversion,""[14] guerrillas were used as an excuse, as they were never substantial enough to control territory, gain material support by any foreign power, or otherwise threaten national security.[15][16][17] Condor's key members were the governments in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, while Brazil signed the agreement later on. Ecuador and Peru later joined the operation in more peripheral roles.[18][19]

The United States government provided planning, coordinating, training on torture,[20] and technical support and supplied military aid to the Juntas during the Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan administrations.[2][21] Such support was frequently routed through the CIA.[21]

19467,"This game is impossibly fun in a way I didn't even know a game could be. The concept is simple: crewmates are given the objective of fixing the ship/base, and impostors try to kill them before the base can be fixed. But what starts out as a very simple concept combines elements of survival horror, stealth action, intense strategy and a little bit of luck. The game is without a doubt one of my favorite combinations of elements ever, and it makes for an incredibly addictive formula that will have you hooked for hours on end. This game is as sus as it gets."

19480,"Among us is a very popular game in space and crewmates with imposters and i reccomend it!
"
19481,amogus
19482,"its alright at best. there are other games out there that are better that are similar some even free. I bought this on the sale and hardly played it. playing it online you spend most your time called to an emergency meeting every 2 mins that people call for no reason but to talk about rubbish in the chat so you dont really get time to play the game properly. 

Dont bother."

19518,"I'm disappointed in myself, that I played a murder game about beans for 500 hours."
19519,Great game to play with friends. Not worth the effort with randoms as there are a lot of young children playing.
19520,sus
19521,nice
19522,A bit SUS..
19523,"Concerned parent here. This game has tore my family apart. My son has committed 3 CRIMES after playing this game. Those 3 crimes have all been murder. He says that he needs to be ""sus"" and is the ""impostor"". My son KILLED my husband and told me that I can't ""report"" the body other wise the other crewmates will think he is ""sus"" and that he would be ""ejected"". This game has completely corrupted my son, he would of never done ANYTHING like this before playing this game. I am so dissapointed that this game is still on the store. It is making kids the ""impostor"" and they are literally committing crimes. Why is this still up?"
19524,"amog us is a good game sometimes, too bad the community isn't as big as it was near the end of 2020 and the start of 2021. I think it was released in 2017, who knows why it blew up in 2020 lol."

19527,"Great  game, public lobbies are sometimes a bit messy, but overall, great experience."
19528,"Good game, loved playing its. But completely broken if you are in Australia - will just disconnect you all the time at the end of each game. No way to fix the problem.
Would not recommend to anyone who isn't in a major country.
Developers need to fix their game for adding more new stuff.
Classic example of indie games not doing the basics right and trying to cash in."

19539,"This game is very fun, but only as a party game. It is great to play with your friend group if you have enough people, but it can easily be ""solved"" or sweated to the point where it is not fun. So it is important to play with not-sweaty people. This game isn't very fun solo since you have to play online, but it can be fun to troll online lobbies with one or two friends."
19540,"Updated the game far far too late after it's spike in playerbase, but if you can find a group of friends to still get on the game it can be a ton of fun, its great just to get people together and it's completely unique, great game but wonder if its playerbase would still benefit from it going Free to Play."
19541,"Fun to play, especially with friends or a Discord group. A lot of work needs to go into improving the servers though."
19542,"game fun. watch out for the predatory 30 year olds and the kids who mom and dad left them though. Other than those depressions, epic."

Things such as your impostor teammate being voted off, so they tell its you too is something that is really annoying and makes the game less fun to play when you meet a player like that, but overall a great game."

"
19572,"Among Us, my life and soul. Never have I loved something more than among us. It is not a game, more like a lifestyle. I believe that if among us had not come into my life I wouldn't be here today, It is such a wonderful thing that all people should be allowed to experience. It has also made an apparent change in my sex life. I cannot get off if my partner isn't in an among us style suit. My wife has recently divorced me because of this and seems she is entitled to the kids. She thinks this because I attempted to do an among us cosplay with my kids. My wife became upset after I attempted to snap the neck of my four year old since I was the sussy imposter. This game is amazing and I love it so much."

19585,"Among Us USED to be good. But now, there's a bunch of autocheat false positives, connection issues, bugs - heck, I'm writing this review because I just got a Crewmate win, and instead of the win screen, I got a blank screen for 2 minutes before closing the game.
It's fun. But bad now."

19634,Funny imposter game
19635,"Before I tell you about among us i'll tell you how to play!

When go into a game you are ether a Impostor or a crewmate. If your a crewmate you have to do all your tasks to win, or vote out the impostor in the meetings, you can start a meeting by clicking the red button on the maps, or you can report a body. When your a crewmate you can be a normal crewmate, engineer, the gurdian angel, or the scientist. All doing different things! I won't talk about all the rules but I will in a later review!

Now for the impostor! If you the imposter, you have to kill almost all the crewmates or vote them out. Without being discorvered! You can be a normal impostor, or a shapeshifter, that can shapeshift into anyone.

In conclusion, this is a fun game that is in my opinion, 10+. 

I hope you enjoy the game!"

19653,"I can't fucking take it. I see an image of a random object posted and then I see it, I fucking see it. ""Oh that looks kinda like the among us guy"" it started as. That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a fridge that looked like among us, I'd see an animated bag of chips that looked like among us, I'd see a hat that looked like among us. And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than ""sus."" I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is ""red sus"" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word ""among"" is ruined. The phrase ""among us"" is ruined. I can't live anymore. Among us has destroyed my fucking life. I want to eject myself from this plane of existence. MAKE IT STOP! Highly recommend 9/10"

19667,It is a really interesting game! You have to use teamwork or betray people with around the world! People will be picked to be Crewmates. They have to do all their tasks to win or to eject out Imposters to win! People will also be picked to be Imposters. They have to kill Crewmates and disguise and be like the crew. They can sabotage and stop the crew from doing things. You should play it right now! It's called Among Us!

19673,"Well, I would say its a nice game, its funny, you can play with friends and the round are definitely always fun. BUT the only thing that keeps me frustrated is that people leave the game, if they arent the imposter. 
I think they should put something like a 1 minute ban or maybe just a timeout in the game after you leave the game 3 times in a row.
Still its a nice game which I personally enjoyed and I can just recommend it:)"

19685,"What are you looking at reviews for? This game is freaking Among Us, you should know what this game is by now lol. Other than that, it is a fairly fun game to play lol. The premise is that a group of people are trying to fix a ship and figure out who is the imposter, while imposters hide amongst the group and kill off the numbers one by one until there is no majority to vote them out for being suspisous. If you had never played than I do recommend."
19686,"I used to play this game with no problem, but now I apparently need parental permission? I'm nearly 40, my parents don't need to weigh in on this.

Thumbs down, requesting refund."

19690,"I had this game for about a year now but most of my experience of this game were in the time where I got covid more than 2 weeks ago. For I played this game because I didn't have the energy to play other games to be honest. In this game you can move your character around by using only your mouse and like when you can't even do that you can just lay down and play the game on your mobile phone.

It's hard to describe this game. Like in one match you find your self with those detective -smarter than every one- guys who will accuse you for doing nothing and they'll take good pleasure of doing that if they got the impostor kicked out by a mare hunch.
In other lobbies you might find your self with guys who like trolling around and just doing some kind of a meme that I don't quite understand. Gotta say they were cool though.
There's also those kind of try hards that you find in every game who will abuse in game bugs just to win the match. Like in one match the impostor killed a guy right after another body was reported so the game didn't count the kill and when the meeting was over that dead body the game didn't count spawned laying on the ground next to the guy who killed it. No body noticed that but one girl who was so happy to turn the impostor in and ruin our fun in the match.
I don't understand that to be honest. Like just ignore that and have fun in your current match. There is no ranked system in this game where you'll lose points if you don't win. Some times you just gotta take the smallest slice of a cake in order for everyone to eat.
There were also those people who abuse there admin rights by kicking others out of lobbies just to get the skin color they wanted. And those who will get you kicked cause they didn't like you being quiet. Just cause you should be at your best form to play the game with them I guess.

Over time I found some real cool guys who are just playing the game to have fun. They didn't really care if they were wining or not. They were just there to make friends and laugh. Shout out to those guys Hopeless, Tiger, Mulan, Sub, Scampy I think, Gedoo, Sunmoon and so many others I can't really remember there names. You guys mad this game so fun for me when I had a rough time.
Over all a great game and I would definitely recommend it."

19699,"I honestly think this is one of the best games of the Decade. The Mystery, Team conflict, even the pure blast of killing people is so amazing to me. Truly a game that can make and break friendships. I LOVE this game so much. and I hope that content never stops coming out because this game has made my life. Its amazing. Thank you.

Edit: I think that goose goose duck is an amazing game too but im sure it will never compete with among us. Compared to the killing and roles, Among us is So many steps ahead and better. Its not even close. I am in love with amongussy."

19713,this game explores a team like game in a science way that depends on a scary real world common phobia of not being able to trust your friends (if you have any) playing this game with friends is a fun time. meanwhile the public lobbies depend on idiots and other horrible people who hate a group of people that swear at you if they get voted off and they also cheat a bunch. Only play this game with your friends our you may have brain tumors. I cant even go a day without hearing amog us or sus and it has been YEARS get over it people.

19728,"Imagine, 700 years in the future, through some last vestige of the internet kept in an underground server, a notification miraculously appears on your device (which has been preserved in nuclear dust from the 5th world war). One night, an alien working a late shift at the museum of archeology notices the cracked screen suddenly light up, and upon it, one word arises from the battered code: Amogus. They do not know what this word means. They ponder it deeply. They scour the ancient tomes, desperate to understand its mystifying origin. It drives them mad. Is it a primeval cipher? The motto of a bygone civilization? A message from God? Night after night they study it by candlelight. They flip through pages in books so old, the slightest cough would turn the paper to a fine off-white powder. The answer is nowhere to be found. And then they are struck by a revelation: I was not meant to know this word. Its esoteric nature escapes my grasp for a reason. What if its meaning is too enlightening to bear? With this revelation comes anger. Spite. Despair. Why shouldn't I understand it?! What cosmic forces are there at play to keep me from such knowledge?! In a fit of desperate rage, they shatter your device against a wall and exclaim, arms raised to the heavens: ""This is literally 1984!"" Silence... Their pleas are unanswered. Sadly, in the end, their inability to unlock the word's meaning drives them to suicide. Its secrets are never known. So I ask you this: is it better to die having never understood the true mind-bending nature of Amogus, or to be driven mad by the little spaceman in his blood-red suit? If you knew enlightenment would render you incapable of living on this mortal earth without making daily references to a game of space mafia, would you accept it? With knowledge comes power, but also endless suffering. Choose wisely, and be wary when standing at the edge of that great abyss we call ""the Truth,"" lest you fall too deep."

19809,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

19830,"I can't FUCKING believe this. Pink from 'Among Us' ruined my marriage.

A couple months ago, my wife said she was going out for a ladies' night. She asked me to take care of my son, so I immediately obliged. ""Yes Ma'am,"" I told her. After a while of waiting, she finally left and I could play my favourite game, Among Us. I hopped on my laptop, booted it up and my desktop loaded, complete with the 'Red Sus' background and all my Among Us Impostor fan-art. I was shaking in excitement. I slowly dragged my finger across the track pad, and watched the cursor as it glided over to the Among Us icon. Among Us. My absolute favourite game of all time and quite possibly the best and most well-made game in the entire world. As I clicked the button my body twitched with joy at the thought of being the impostor again. My fingers drummed impatiently on my desk as the Innersloth logo faded in, and then out. Then the main title appeared. I immediately looked at pink as she slowly floated across the screen. Oh, how I wish I could feel those luscious, soft asscheeks. Pink is my queen. The real woman in my life. My wife could never be as sexy as Pink is; her soft footfalls in electrical as I peek at her curvy form from inside a vent, waiting for the right time to strike. I could never get close to Pink, however, as if she had some kind of sixth sense, she would always leave before I could reveal myself to her as the impostor. I press Practice, to warm up my fingers before my first intense game of Among Us. I hit Blue in Comms, then cross the hall and vent to Specimen, murdering Green in cold blood. The thrill of killing an animated character in an online game has never been such a rush. I then move towards Reactor, stabbing Yellow in the back and then running down the corridor to the right to access Decontamination. I move quietly through the halls, like a snake about to strike its prey, and I see- Oh no. It's Pink. Standing there motionlessly as I face her directly. Her visor shows no emotion. But she knows. I can feel it in the air. I can't kill her. She is too beautiful, too angelic, the light reflecting off of her pink bodysuit, like stars on a voided sky. She doesn't run. I am moved to tears as I caress the screen, kissing it tenderly. ""Goodbye, Pink. See you soon. It will all be okay,"" I whisper in a soft, reassuring voice. Then as my cursor hovers over the kill button, I hesitate. Thoughts of love go through my head. Red having reddish-pink sus children with Pink. But I have to. As the impostor, it is my duty to kill. I press the 'Kill' button and watch as my character beheads Pink silently. All I hear is the spurt of blood. There is no rush. There is only Red, standing by himself in Fuel. Pink's lifeless body laying on the floor beside him. I feel nothing at first, then immense sadness, like I'm at a loved one's funeral. My son knocks on the door, interrupting my brief moment of mourning. He asks, ""Dad? Are you going to make me a snack?"" I tell him to shut up, and my voice cracks. I break down sobbing. I killed her. I killed my one true love. God, forgive me. I open the door to my son, and he has a confused look on his face. I say nothing, and walk to the kitchen to make him a sandwich. Tears roll off my face into the bread as I lay it onto the counter. Lettuce, cheese and meat, followed by a sad swirl of mustard on top. My son is quiet. He sits on the couch, and stares at the floor. There is a depressing air around us. I serve him the sandwich and walk back to my room, contemplating life. If I killed Pink, how am I to be trusted around my family? I cry for hours, and finally my wife comes back. She sees me bawling on the bed like a child who dropped his ice cream. She then asks me why I'm crying and mutter, ""I killed her. I killed my only love, Pink, in Among Us."" She is filled with rage and slaps me across my face. I feel numb. She asks for a divorce. I don't reply. Instead, I take my laptop and get into my car, driving to a nearby hotel. Fast forward a few months to the divorce. It was quick and painless. After court, I ask my former wife to take me back.


""I can't take you back. You've always been this way. I was sus of you from the start.""

19886,"I can't fucking take it. I see an image of a random object posted and then I see it, I fucking see it. ""Oh that looks kinda like the among us guy"" it started as. That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a fridge that looked like among us, I'd see an animated bag of chips that looked like among us, I'd see a hat that looked like among us. And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacally any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than ""sus."" I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is ""red sus"" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word ""among"" is ruined. The phrase ""among us"" is ruined. I can't live anymore. Among us has destroyed my fucking life. I want to eject myself from this plane of existence. MAKE IT STOP!"

20040,Left a dent in the internet.
20041,"As many know by now, this is a fantastic game to play. However there are some things I have issues with. First, there is no in-game chat system. This is quite annoying as it makes it more difficult to converse with other players especially when many players create lobbies with crazy fast voting time constraints. Not to mention most don't even wanna bother with typing in the chat. This game is really fun, but sometimes it feels like you'll just have more fun if you're playing with a large group of close friends in a discord server."
20042,Entertaining with friends
20043,My buddy told me about it so I gave it a shot. One of the best games I've ever played. it really makes you put your thinking cap on. And it always changes up because your always playing with new people. Great Game!!!
20044,"Among Us is a game that requires you to figure out who is SUS. Or rather if you are SUS, kill the other remaining crew members. As a normal crew mate you either need to do a certain number of tasks to win the game as a team or figure out who is SUS."
20045,"Nice game, very enjoyable, the best is playing with friends and trolling other people. Also me being detective and calling everyone out, who is doing fake tasks."
20046,used to be good now you have to give intersloth your credit card or social security number to acsess most basic game features like names and free chat its gotten to the point that you would be better off playing the old roblox ripoffs of it unless they reverse every update since early 2021 i dont recommend it
20047,i liked the game its so fun when u play with ur friends
20048,yes
20049,Great group game. Better when talking to the group is possible via Discord or all together in a room.

20063,"It's very fun! Playing either as a crewmate doin' tasks, scared of the one among us or a deadly impostor whose goal is to kill them all! The developers even added new roles like medic, scientist and guardian angle and it makes the game incredibly stupendous. It's fun playing on the four maps as each are unique and offer different features (Airship for example has different tasks and layout in contrast with the Planet base Polus). The only problem I have is that it's not compatible on Mac! Please, Innersloth, can you fix the Mac port? It would certainly be an appreciation to the fandom who wants to play on their mac and is unable to."

The Ethiopian poisonous catapillar aka SLICK DADDY. lets talk about the cabinets right behind me that go 40ft deep that house the other 95% of my trophies, the awards, the certificates, all claiming first place, right?

20100,Fun game that’s easy to jump in to.  I find myself laughing the whole time I’m playing. Very amusing and interesting concept that’s simple but has endless replay-ability.  It has a “board game night” vibe that people who aren’t huge video gamers can get a kick out of as well as the more hardcore gamers…Definitely a game that should be in your library and always fun to jump on and play a few rounds once in a while with friends or random people.

20149,"lay the Spire, but the game tells its own dark and cryptic story with some very unique mechanics. Late game challenges end up funneling the player towards some specific powerful combos, so I would really like to see more content added in future updates. Art style is unique and menacingly beautiful. Story is just cryptic enough to make you want to dive back in and see more endings. All-in-all, it is totally worth your time and money."

20151,"This is the only game that can kill your soul in ways you can't imagine if you don't play it. When you play this game you sacrifice yourself and forever you can never look at anything that looks anything like a simple among us character. This game can destroy any friendship no matter the time spent together and no matter what trust you have built over years. No language can possibly explain the horrors this game puts you through, even after you stop playing you are forced to manically laugh whenever someone says sus, among us, meeting, vent, or anything even remotely close to being in among us. There in no salvation even if you don't play because when you play this game you are forced to spread among us memes against your will. If you have never heard of this game before pls read this and immidietly smash your device before its to late. Colors are scary the walls are curving I can't think for 5 minutes without among us popping into my head I can't describe what it takes to get through the day this is not a review this is a cry for help pls instead of just saying sus i can't last another year like this my life is among us my life is among us my life is among us my life is among us my life is among us my life is among us my life is among us my life is among us my life is among us my life is among us my life is among us my life is among us my life is among us my life is among us.

Ever since the chat wheel have been forced on to people under the age of  13 or 18 years old, people dont wanna play anymore because you cant give a well explanation of why whoever is the impostor + it make the chat boring because people cant use their personality. if the circle chat feature i think more people will come back and that would lead to Popular content creators who play currently popular games For example: Mr beast and SSSniperwolf, which would promote the game and yall (the among us devs) would end up making more money.

20248,"My German fellow-countrymen and women! Party Comrades! It is, I think, something very extraordinary when a man after about 20 years can stand before his old followers, and when in doing so he has not had to make any revisions of his program during these 20 years.

Today's gathering, however, reminds us most of all of the evening which we were able to celebrate in the former hall 10 years ago. It reminds us of this because at that time too we were in the midst of a very hard fight. Our fight to take over power in, Germany was just as decisive for our fate as the fight which we are waging today. It was only during the past year that this became known to us in all its meaning, and if victory had not been achieved in 1933, then Germany would have remained what it was then, that is, a powerless nation with an Army of 100,000 men, which would necessarily have (had to submit) to destruction.

And at the same time, a colossus had arisen in the East with only a single thought in mind, to fall upon this weak, lazy, defeatist and internally-torn Europe. And if at that time this challenge had not been successfully taken up, then the power which alone was capable of opposing this danger would not have entered world history.

Today we know that there would probably not be any Europe left. Therefore the battle which we fought then was only apparently an internal struggle for power. In reality, even then it was a struggle for the preservation of Germany and, in the broadest sense of the word, for the preservation of Europe. At that time, we were close to victory. And yet when, 10 years ago, we met in the former hall, no one knew exactly how close it was. Only one thing went without saying as far as we were concerned, namely the conviction that this victory, no matter what happens, must come and will come.

It is with the same conviction that I now stand before you, and it has never left me, either, since the day on which, as an unknown man in this city, I began the struggle, first for the soul of the German people, and then, on beyond this city, forever more and more followers. And in the beginning I did not have much more to give than faith, the faith that if anyone pursues a just aim I with unchanging and undisturbed loyalty and never lets himself be diverted from it, but puts everything into it, then others will be found who are determined to be his followers, and that from this host an ever stronger faith must gradually radiate to the whole people, and that out of this host the worthiest part of the whole people must one day finally find themselves together, and that finally this worthiest part must acquire the power in the state.

And today I stand by this same view. Fate, or Providence, will give the victory to those who most deserve it. We could have had it before, in the year 1918. The German people did not deserve it at that time. They had grown confused and untrue to themselves. And that was the reason that I, an unknown, a nobody, at that time resolved to build up this movement in the midst of utter ruin and complete collapse, the reason why I also had faith that it would have to succeed, because I saw before me, not the defeatist phenomena of a crumbling bourgeois-Marxist world, but the millions of brave men who had done their utmost and who faltered only because the homeland was no longer worthy of them in the critical hour-because it had failed. I then had the conviction that if only the effort to bring back internal order to the German people and to get hold of the soundest kernel in them proved successful, that then another 1918 could never be repeated.

Since I made this resolve, many more than 20 years have gone by. Ten years ago we were about to have a dress rehearsal, after the movement had already encountered the greatest difficulties-in a preceding ten-year period, many had lost their faith, and our opponents already were saying that we were dead. We need only recall that time. It was no wonder, either. A movement which was just getting ready to seize power collapsed completely. Its leaders were either dead or wounded, or in prison or in flight because of their activities.

And yet barely ten years were enough for this whole movement to rise anew from its ashes, like a phoenix. And when we met here 10 years ago, we had just had another setback. Many-especially our enemies-believed that we had lost our chance because we had not acted at the moment we were offered something which would only have burdened the movement, but not made it at all possible to realize its real aims. At that time, too, I stood before you, my old party comrades, with the same faith as now, absolutely convinced that victory will be his who best deserves it, and that therefore our only task will be to deserve it.

And when now, after 10 years, I again survey this period, I can say that upon no people has Providence ever bestowed more successes than upon us. The miracles we have achieved in the last three years in the face of a whole world of enemies are unique in history, especially the crises we very naturally often had in these years.

I need only remind you of the one great crisis we had to go through in Norway, where, indeed, it was a toss-up, and where we might have asked ourselves, will we be able to hold Narvik? Won't the entire Norwegian undertaking go to pieces? One needed boundless faith in order not to become despondent at that time, and this faith was finally rewarded. Far from the homeland, with barely a single sure line of communication connected with this advanced out-post, a small, heroic German force then was fighting. Finally they were forced to evacuate Narvik. Our opponents were jubilant. But, thanks to bravery and a fanatical determination not to capitulate under any circumstances, the final result was victory for us and not for our opponents.

If we look back over this entire period, and let everything pass before our eyes, one thing will become obvious to us: We are. facing the same opponents, whom we always have had before us nothing has been changed. . . . In the Great War there were the same opponents whom we have had to conquer in this war, and there is only one thing which differentiates the present from that time: First of all, a clearer recognition of the background of the actions of that opponent, of the driving forces, and secondly, the successes which have been gained in the meanwhile, successes which are unique in the history of the world.

For perhaps many a person will ask himself the question, why are we fighting at such great distances? We are fighting at such great distances in order to protect our homeland, in order to keep the war as far removed from it as possible and to spare it what would otherwise be its fate, and which now only certain German cities are experiencing and must experience. It is therefore preferable to keep the front line at a distance of 1,000 and if necessary 2,000 kilometers from the borders of the Reich, than to hold that front somewhere near the border of the Reich and to be forced to hold it there.

Our opponents are the same, and behind these opponents there stands the same eternally driving force, the international Jew. And it is again by no means an accident that these forces were on the inside, and have now met again on the outside. Internally, in the ""coalition"" which we know only too well, they included all the enemies of the Reich, beginning with the Frankfurter Zeitung, and the entire stock market speculator-group, all the way to the Rote Fahne (Red Banner) in Berlin, and everything which lay in between.

And outside, we have again today the same coalition as before, from the chief of that international Masonic lodge, the half-Jew Roosevelt, and his Jewish brain trust, to the Jewry of purest water in Marxist-Bolshevik Russia. They are the same enemies as before, the same foes as then. In the World War we had them as external foes, in our struggle as internal foes, and now, as a National-Socialist Sta"

+ Relatively Cheap
+ Good to play with friends

- Sometimes difficult to enter lobbies
- Can get repetitive quickly

Overall, I like this this game and would recommend it, I enjoyed playing it with my friends - however being more of a single player gamer, I found it rather annoying sometimes when entering different lobbies for games not to start, spending sometimes 15 minutes trying to find a game."

20324,"This game is a clear example of a dev team that instead of just jumping on the next sub-genre bandwagon, they clearly spent time studying and reinventing what makes it great in the first place. Ring of Pain could have easily been just another rip-off of Slay the Spire, but the game tells its own dark and cryptic story with some very unique mechanics. Late game challenges end up funneling the player towards some specific powerful combos, so I would really like to see more content added in future updates. Art style is unique and menacingly beautiful. Story is just cryptic enough to make you want to dive back in and see more endings. All-in-all, it is totally worth your time and money."

20465,"So I was playing this in class and all was fine for DAYS until Miss Tracher caught me and sent me to the principal after I refused to hand over my phone. I was unto the impostor, you see, I can't just up and leave, I mean. I got sent to the principal after class but as I just kept playing I was gradually being shouted at. These randoms don't seem to understand that it's sus to just leave a game without warning. Only beta ligmas do that.

But then, as I kept playing, I heard the principal say that I'm suspended... Involuntarily, my fingers twitched and couldn't swipe the card in admin at the perfect pace and Red saw it and immediately called an emergency meeting. I was yeeted out and I knew I deserved it... Because it kept echoing in my mind... That I am SUS pended!

Finally! I get to be the imp! I was not gonna let this banana coloured Principal space bean person rat me out so quickly, so I quickly called my parents and told them that I saw Principal faking her tasks. They asked what I meant by that, so I told them that she was just sitting behind her desk doing nothing all day, then I hung up and ran out. I had some sabotaging to do. I ignored the shouting behind my back, I knew I had to have an alibi if others were to believe me.

First I had to divert attention, so I ran to the FEMALE bathroom (I'm a sigma male), took out two of my thickest books, maths and biology, and started hitting all the faucets that I could see until I broke all of them. I got a bit splashed but luckily it was summer, so I ran out just in time as the music started playing, signalling the break. I started shouting louder than Jsustin B. that I saw Principle acting sus around the toilets.

The water was soon pouring all over the hall making everyone slip and fall but I had to contain my laughter to avoid being sus. I joined the janitor in pretending to help him with the repairs but he cussed me away, though my time spent pretending was just long enough for others to see. I vented back to Tracher's classroom and saw her sorting the documents from her table to the shelves. ""WRONG MAP YOU SUSSY BAKA"" I shouted and ran out to tell the rest of the crew.

As I was running down the stairs, I saw Meryl, the silent kid walking all alone, so I pushed her and laughed as I ran further, hearing her crackling fall behind me. I was about to find someone and throw them through the entrance but then I saw my parents pull up just in front. So I started running back but Principal was at the top of the stairs, so I had to make a turn but in the next hallway, Meryl waited with this sussy smile and hit me in the face with her backpack.

As I lay there I realised I wasn't even teh impostor, I was the Engineer, that's why I was SUS pended and why I could brake faucets with my books. The true imp gave me this evil look and ran away. I was in too much pain to explain this to Principle and my parents all showing up at the same time, so I got thrown out from school and I get it, it's just a game, but come on, sheesh, can't all these randoms just use their brains for once? I clearly didn't do anything wrong.

11/10 would be SUS pended again."

20495,This game used to be fun. up until they changed their rules. now I'm unable to use the normal chat or access my old account. This is because I accidentaly put in the wrong age when creating me account after the new update. I have done extensive reaserch and it apears to be impossible to fix. this makes me paying for the game a waste of money and as i played 30 hours before the update it is no longer refundable.

I love that it's basically John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (1982), which is one of my favorite movies ever, but the actual gameplay and mechanics are very bare bones and the playerbase is full of (horny) children who don't play seriously; which kind of ruins the genre.

Since then, new features have been added to try keep it interesting (more colour options, up to 15 players, and the introduction of extra roles, such as shapeshifters and guardian angels). There are still enough players to be able to pretty much instantly join in on a game with randomers, and the devs have worked hard to try deal with issues such as people quitting at the start of the game. For four euro it's worth it, you can either play with strangers or get a group together yourself."

20581,"The game itself is fun - if you're playing in a lobby with people you personally know and scheduled to play a game with. 

If you try public games then you're kind of screwed unless you find the rare host that doesn't immediately DC when they're not imposter - which bugs the game to lock you on a black screen when it ends. No victory/defeat screen, and you have to force close the game when it happens. 

Not only that but there's a bunch of weird BNHA RP lobbies that will instantly ban you if you join without a weeb ""wolfbaku"" ""deku$lut"" name and I've heard it's just as bad with the FNF ones. The lobby names are easy enough to avoid but the problem is there's SO many of them that sometimes that's all you can find, even with refreshing.

Both are frustrating to the point it's just not an enjoyable experience even when you do finally manage to find the one lobby out of dozens that doesn't break the game."
20582,"The game is good, unfortunately I haven't played in a while and after trying to play today the game wants me to link accounts. I attempted to link to steam but apparently I can't. I've spent money on this game and now I have access to none of it."
20583,"It's a fun game to play with friends, each game is different from the last one you played. Only downside is there are a lot of children who don't understand what they're doing, or a game is thrown because people give away who they are really quick. The game is versatile, and I can't wait for more updates."

20637,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that."

It was always mind boggling how there are mods out there with 20 new roles and game modes and whatever and the game did not change a bit over way too much time.

Anyways definitely recommended."

Gameplay
this game is all about betraying your friends, and its great to play online. the tasks are fun and enjoyable. 8/10
Running
this game runs fine, but its not the best. sometimes the servers get too full, and its just kind of annoying and unfun to play when that happens. 5/10
Looks
this game is simple, and it looks great. the art style fits with the rest of the game. 
10/10
overall
overall, this game is super fun, and I play it all the time.

As much as I love this game, (honestly, I think that the game itself is great, the community is the real problem) the people can be VERY toxic. I have had many instances where people have asked me personal questions or said disgustingly rude things to others.

Gameplay

The game is really simple. A maximum of 10 people can play, and you are randomly assigned a role of either imposter or crewmate. 1 to 3 of the people are imposters and the rest are the crew. The crew does simple mini-games, report dead bodies, and work as a team to find out who the killers are, and get rid of them, while the imposters kill crewmates, cause chaos, and use deceitful tactics to blame crewmates for murder. You have 4 buttons when assigned to the imposter.
Kill
Sabotage
Report
Vote
The crewmates each have 3
Report
Use
Vote

Violence

The game has no blood or gore, though there are goofy, cartoon images of snapping necks, guns, stabbing, or forked snake tounges that impale you when you are killed. When you die, you are depicted as a ghost, who only you and the other dead players can see. To living players, they can only see your body, which is half of your cartoon avatar, with a bone sticking out. All silly cartoon violence, and not very scary.

SexThis is a big issue with the community of players, not the game. People will probably be asked AT LEAST ONCE what their name is, their gender identity, where they live, what their phone number is, if they will go out with them, or for their social media usernames. People use very vulgar language and slang, which can be offensive. I have been in games where someone gave out their address and told a person to come over to their house. People use language that should not be used in general, especially not around kids under 10. This can be a fun place to socialize or play, but it can also be a platform for gross creeps. People also create games that are private just so that they can talk sexually without others in the game who actually want to play. I have been called a hoe multiple times, and have seen others be called things much worse and use words that shouldn't even EXIST!

Language
First, I want to say that the chat censor doesn't really work. It will NOT censor things like the N-word, p---y, and plenty of other words. People will edit words so that they are not blocked even with the censor on, like sht or fck. This can be kind of scary and is what made me steer clear of the game initially. Racism, sexism, and anti-LQBTQ+ are all problems and bullies can be cruel just because you didn't want to say where you live, or because they simply lost the game to you. If you do use the censor, it will protect you from some words, but Innersloth DEFINITELY did not think of all the things people say. It will look like this with the censor: h***. If you turn this setting on and join a toxic game, the chat will be so bleeped out, you can't follow the game. The control can also be turned on/off with a single click of a button.

Overall, I think the game is great, especially if you play with friends or people you know. This is a good game for building teamwork skills and has great animation. I am also NOT saying that all people are toxic, but this is an ISSUE! People can be kind and friendly, and if everyone is nice, the environment can change a lot. So, there you have Among Us from my point of view. I hope that this helped you decide if you should let your kid install the game, or install it yourself. Thanks!"

[h1] The Pros [/h1]

+4 different maps to choose from, each varying in size
+Lots of options to customize the rules and limitations of a game if you're the host of a room, to make it how you like it
+It is possible to be a certain type of crewmate or impostor, if the host of the room your in allows it
+A variety of tasks, some being exclusive to certain maps
+You can now report players who are acting inappropriately; this is a feature the game did not initially have
+Lots of cosmetics to put on your crewmate
++Big updates don't happen extremely often, but when they do happen, they are GREAT.

[h1] The Cons [/h1]

-Kind of a nitpick, but all except one pet is locked behind a $1 paywall, and that one pet requires you to link your Twitch account
-Kicking players acting inappropriately requires most of the other players to votekick them, which is often a pain

[h1] The Verdict [/h1]

For a game that only costs $5, Among Us has absolutely no right to be nearly as fun as a game that costs 12 times that amount. But here we are. While it's not as popular as it was in the second half of 2020, it still gets a very solid amount of players, and you can see why. This game is perfect for a family game night to really test how honest or how much of a liar everyone is. It's especially to fun to play with friends on Discord or other platforms. After all, you may think you know how much a troll they are, but do you really? I could really see this game thriving for at least the next couple of years, especially with the dedicated team it has behind it that strive to make it bigger and better with each major update that drops.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get revenge on some friends who randomly voted me out for no damn reason whatsoever.

21015,"This game is garbage.

When it asks you for the age whatever input is current year, and then it sends you an email to confirm that your 0 (ZERO) years old child can play this game. They want your ID or your credit card. I f*****g pay for this game, I will not pay to confirm I'm my 0 years old child. (The option to confirm via card does not work outside the USA and I'm from Europe)."

21049,"Among Us is a good game but I've been having this situation for a while and no one has helped me:
Every time I play Among Us, the first thing I do is login. This usually takes 2-10 seconds but 1 day, it all changed. I was playing Among Us and, as usual, I logged in and it said ""You've successfully logged in"". But then, after 3 minutes, it said ""It's taking a while to login"". Why?"
21050,despite the among us memes this is a really good game that i wish didn't become a huge meme

21088,"Not only have they taken peoples money and not given them their products, me included, the user base has gone to hell. Too many trolls, and really gross things allowed to be said in chat and as usernames even if you report them. They are allowing what used to be a fun game to have nothing good about it anymore. Also, if you decide to play NEVER spend real money. Those of us that have and haven't gotten anything only get messages back that they've heard from others about missing purchases and then they close out the ticket. They wont even refund you. Between the stealing and the users, it's not worth it anymore."
21089,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

Sometimes you can play this with random people, but it can difficult and frustrating when a lot of them are being idiots. Or you are unable to defend yourself and they vote for you immediately.

21259,I will continue to play this game but it relies too heavily on the player not meta-gaming. This game is fun ONLY when the players you play with limit themselves. If you want to win as crewmate you stack groups no counterplay. Another way you can win is triple stacking cams. Last way is to stack cams and admin. The way you could counter this is by having a timer on the alive crewmates fixing tasks before the ship blows up or something. Also to end game everyone has to finish tasks but making it so alive crewmates have a timer will stop people from stacking.
21260,This game is very good. It's entertaining and very distinctive.

21330,"""Stop posting about Among Us. I'm tired of seeing it. My friends on Tik-Tok send me memes, on discord its fucking memes. I was in a server, right, and all of the channels were just Among Us stuff. I showed my champion underwear to my girlfriend, and the logo I flipped it and said to, 'Hey babe, when the imposter is sus! Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding, ding ding ding,' I looked at a trashcan and said, 'that's a bit sussy!' I looked at my penis, I think of the astronaut's helmet, and I go, 'Penis? More like peen-sus.'""

21333,Shit game not worth $5
21334,
21335,"Wow
"
21336,"This game saved my life.

I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
21337,"Play it with friends, and lose them"
21338,"this game sucks, don't waste your time. this game is toxic and is boring as hell. All you do is grind for cosmic cubes. Its also impossible being the imposter considering that everyone sticks together and are retards. Its the same game play with no changes, I only play this game when i'm bored. The only thing fun about this game being impostor and then once you finally become imposter is so hard. Also saying among us memes is band kid humor. 0/10 just based on the people."

21376,"I can't fucking take it. I see an image of a random object posted and then I see it, I fucking see it. ""Oh that looks kinda like the among us guy"" it started as. That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a fridge that looked like among us, I'd see an animated bag of chips that looked like among us, I'd see a hat that looked like among us. And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than ""sus."" I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is ""red sus"" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word ""among"" is ruined. The phrase ""among us"" is ruined. I can't live anymore. Among us has destroyed my fucking life. I want to eject myself from this plane of existence."
21377,WHY DID THEY REMOVE THE CHAT  WHY CAN I ONLY PICK Where was (____) JUST WHY ALSO I WHY CANT I CHANGE MY NAMES!?!?!?!?!?

21383,"Three people are dead, and the lights have gone out, I nervously approach the lights panel, 3 others are there all together but there are no safety in numbers as a stack kill causes confusion.
But the lights must been seen to, so I slip into place and randomly flip switches, then quickly press the kill button.
Of the 3 in the stack two of us were Impostors.
Paranoia runs rampant across the discussion boards as I grin evilly to myself.

21411,"It's not fun. You can only POSSIBLY PERHAPS MAYBE ALMOST COULD have fun if you are playing with friends. If not, you're GUARANTEED to have a lobby where everybody leaves, people are discord cheating, people calling meetings for no reason, there are hackers, and there are terrible impostors. DO NOT BUY!"
21412,"It's so funny to be 23 and saying this, but this is my favorite game, whether to play solo or with a group, it's always a winner, plus I'm looking forward to all the new updates and maps coming out this year :)"
21413,a fun way to kill time thanks to covid still being a pain in the butt. making new friends and having a good time even if other players become trolls. one thing i'd like to see is a special chat for imposters if there are more than one.

Crossplay- Check
Mods- Check
Family fun - Check

Sometimes matchmaking can be rough, as people like to leave in the beginning if the are not selected for any special role they prefer.

If you have friends, then this can be fun for a goof amount of hours, otherwise you only play once in a while unless its your kinda game. Overall great game and would recommend."

21541,"Frustrating bug - I can't connect to any of the servers, and I only bought this game so that I could play online. Waste of money."
21542,"This is literally the best game I've ever played. God of war who? The legend of zelda? Get out of my way.

The morals and story in this show truly have revealed a new way of living to me. This changed my love life, and my butt in so many ways."

21553,shape shifting is the worst game mechanic i've ever seen in my life. defeats the whole purpose of the game.

21593,SUS
21594,Fun little game with simple controls and for those wondering yes it has crossplay. Should be mentioned that every few months it has waves of hackers appear but if you play private matchs with friends you can avoid it altogether.
21595,"People are salty, and kick you from they're game for no reason. I do NOT recommend. It was good in 2019, before it was really popular, but now its all messed up. I don't recognize this game anymore."
21596,to sussy for my liking
21597,dfdfsafsdafsdafsdafdsadsfa
21598,its pretty much murder mystery but other roles as crewmate. Very strategic and you gotta be smart :)
21599,very sus
21600,Among Us is a killing game.
21601,sus
21602, i think this is a really good game if you like chance games.
21603,Saying that I don't recommend because i'm sick and tired of being called slurs and seeing slurs on the chats. Just ban certain words. It's not that hard. Also the censor chat option sucks because it censors out other players names. I am also not particularly fond of shape shifting and the engineers and scientist
21604,"I HATE AMONG US!!!! IT IS A BLATANT COPY OF GOOSE GOOSE DUCK AND OTHER GAMES ON ROBLOX, NAMELY AMONGST US!!! THIS IS SUCH A BLATANT STEAL AND IT MAKES ME SO MAD THAT THEY DID IT WORSE!!!!"

21649,koala please play among us again....
21650,Girlfriend and I keep killing each other :D
21651,"great and simple idea executed very well.

the only thing I would say is that I wish you could change maps without having to leave a game, maybe have it set so the host picks the map in private games and in public lobbies have it be a voting system. 

Considering that the map selection is the only thing I have problems with this is a great game."
21652,sus
21653,ITS GGOD
21654,there is a reason why this is in my PTSD collection on steam
21655,"No real good updates back when it first came out but as soon as your game got big you decided to work on it again? even cancelling the sequel in order to keep this game afloat. really glad people are making copies of this game and play leagues better than this.
even a battle royale game can make this actually fun."
21656,E
21657,SUS HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!
21658,a
21659,Just Seen Red Vent but voted Blue :)
21660,"Cute little game, but it's a double-edged sword. The gameplay is super easy to figure out, definitely child friendly....BUT. 
I would recommend playing in a private group with friends over playing in the online open servers- every other lobby either has a really sexual name and is obviously bait for minors OR it's a bunch of trolls who do things like call meetings for no reason, etc. When you're playing with friends in a private room it's much easier to keep a good group dynamic going, and of course there's the added fun of being able to play on comms. 

So, yeah. Super great for game night, don't let your kids play if they're under like 15 (I know it's a bit cynical of me to say but I really think any game with unmoderated chat could be potentially dangerous for kids, given the number of lobbies I've seen titled ""hxrnyteenlol"" or ""cxmslut"". Just doesn't seem like the kind of environment young people should be involving themselves in)."
21661,the only game i ever play. this deserves to win game of the year every year. my mom died last week. she didnt check medbay. :P

21667,is gud
21668,there is no sus joke. there is no haha funny amogus. go home.
21669,"This game is perhaps the most well developed game created. The content is equatable to the width of two point five galaxies (exactly). The thrill of becoming the fabled impostor and taking down entire legions of bean men in one swipe is unfathomably great. The intense, high octane gameplay as the crewmate matches no other game on this platform. Steam should be thankful that a gem like this has graced their services. Amog us is truly a great experience!"

Majority of the time when you play a random lobby if some people don't get ""Imposter"" will leave immediately. Besides that this game is an 8.5/10 with amazing gameplay, a variety of maps, and the community to an extent. If you have a couple of dollars to spend then buy Among Us."

everyone form your family will love it ! 

enjoy the games with some of your friends !"

21713,"Pretty good, but, it really isn't a game you can play when you can't speak. I often can't use a microphone when I call my friends, which makes it extremely hard to do anything. However, in the times where I have, proximity chat, while not included in the game, is priceless.

I'm not personally a fan of the new features, and the new map is a little too anxiety inducing to really be entertaining for me, but it makes me happy to see other people enjoying them, even if I personally don't.

It's a great game for making, but also quickly losing friends.

I liked to play the game with some friends and even bought some stuff from the the store.. it was fun until the last update brought me some trouble.

When i try to log in with my account (""already linked to my steamaccount"") the game wants me to verify my age.

There are only two options to verify the age, by having a creditcard or sending a picture of the personal-card.
I wont use any of this options, its a shame to handle it that way after people already bought some stuff in the store.

With best regards,
Northernfate

I truly believe that every family can enjoy playing and build good relationships for their futures."

Its coming up to the anniversary of mine and my wife's (36F) marriage, and the day we met can never be forgotten. It was simply another Monday evening, winding down and playing a exhilerating game of Amongus- when there she was. My heart was pounding, my controller slipping out of my finger sips from the multitude of sweat i was accumilating. Me and the sussy imposter lock eyes- and finally it all made sense, it was *I* who was sussy for the imposter...."

Jokes aren't even funny anymore, they just consist of ""sussy"" and ""looks like there's an impostor among us, Walt."" All I see when I go on twitch to go look at some booba is the top dogs of twitch wasting their lives arguing with their friends about who ""vented"". I don't care who vented. I'm venting about this shit ass community. The games alright tho... 7/10. Just play with friends :)."
22072,Good Fun. Good Friends. :D
22073,"Where can I play minecraft 










Yes I said that"
22074,This immaculate game has expanded my imagination of lies and deceptions people can play. The different ranging colors of the characters adds definition and contrast to the game. The game tells the dear truth of your friends to see their lies and deceptions. This game really showed me how i really have no friends and how they will lie to get anything in their path. Only one thing missing from this beauty of a game. The lore is extremely complex and needs a doctrine degree to understand 3% of the entire lore.  The man who came up with the idea of Among Us deserves the best in life. This game is really a work of art....

22089,"A modern take on the mafia-type board games like, The Resistance. Among Us is a mechanically, simple game where you either trust or distrust players to progress while trying to figure out who the imposters are before you all die. 

As a big fan of ‘The Resistance’ this game has been a treat. The game is heavily dependant on either a large group of friends or a active community. In 2022, the online community is brimming with people and the queues to play a game were short. Games can range between 5-15 minutes depending on player input. New content continues to be developed and things look positive for the future of this title. 

Highly recommended, especially if you can arrange to play this with a large group of friends.

so, definitely check it, just beware of people who are toxic"

22139,"I like the game. The community may be completely brain-dead idiots sometimes, but it usually works out until their incompentence gets us all either brutally murdered by a green bean or thrown into the cold, dark, and endless depths of space. Strangely, despite the many times I have provided proof and evidence to my fellow crewmates, they seem incapable of processing what I have just said. It may be a mental disease of some sort. I will look into this."

Expanded party size is great, the new roles, animations and task are well thought out and I REALLY like that they added the two types of currency. It makes it feel like I am working towards something and gives me more of an initiative to play. The new battle pass style system for the cosmicubes are very fun. I like all the different types of styles you can choose from now, and my personal favorite is the NEW PETS! <3 Love it"

22283,"Tbh, a game you really only play with a group of friends, aside from that, pretty boring game personally. Basically, 1 or 2 crewmates are chosen to be the ""impostor"", which means they can go around and kill people, as well as try sabotage the other crewmates. And the objective for the crewmates is to find out whoever the impostor(s) are, and for the impostor(s) its to not be the most ""sus"" (god I hate myself).

But i have one complaint, i bought Among Us along with some DLC packs before the game had a ""Huge update"" including the new roles and Cosmi-Cubes, and once it updated most if not all of my DLC items were stripped from me and put into the shop, forcing me to buy ""stars"" or whatever they're called just to get them back, even though i already paid for them. Again, great game, but i would like some sort of advice or explanation on why i don't have my stuff."

22371,"I can't fucking take it. I see an image of a random object posted and then I see it, I fucking see it. ""Oh that looks kinda like the among us guy"" it started as. That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a fridge that looked like among us, I'd see an animated bag of chips that looked like among us, I'd see a hat that looked like among us. And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than ""sus."" I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is ""red sus"" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word ""among"" is ruined. The phrase ""among us"" is ruined. I can't live anymore. Among us has destroyed my fucking life"

In regards to this particularly interesting game, such as the one in current subject, I believe I would have to say, that I would not recommend this game to any who feel inclined to spend $4.99 or more on this game. Simply, do not. Play for free :)

Also, light pink (Sussy Bacca) is dumb :("

22382,"I love this game. I play it twice a week without fail.

Introduction: ‘Among Us’ is an online multiplayer game that has been streaming nowadays. In that, there are 10 players in total. Among them, there are 2 groups: crewmates and impostors(impostors can be 1, 2, or 3 according to the number decided by the admin and others are crewmates).

Main structure: At first we are in the lobby where upto 10 players have to join. After the game starts, we get to know whether we are a crewmate or an impostor. If we are a crewmate then we do not know the impostor. If we are an impostor then we know who others are.

The job of crewmates are 2:

Completing the given tasks
Eliminating the impostors
The tasks given are different like electric repair, navigation, etc. Otherwise, we also have to keep a watch on other players as we do not know the impostor. There is also a security CCTV room from which we can watch him.

The job of the impostors is 1:

Eliminating the crewmates
The impostor(s) have to go on a killing spree. They should kill 1 crewmate at a time and that to very privately. Impostors can use a vent, i.e. a transporting underground passageway.

The one who sees a dead body can report. In this case, an impostor can also self report. Otherwise, the crewmates who doubt some player (whether he sees him use vent or killing) can call an emergency. In the emergency, there is a chatbox for discussion where they have to discuss who the impostors are. Dead ones cannot chat. According to that, they have to vote a suspect and later we come to know whether he was an impostor or not.

My recommended tactics: I suggest some tactics for both crewmates and impostors in a game of 2 impostors.

Crewmates

Run away and start performing tasks.
After doing 1 or 2, go to the security and keep a watch on the players.
If you doubt someone or see him clearly killing or venting, run towards the energency for reporting.
If you see 2 players following each other then target one of them. There is a high chance of him being an impostor.
Impostors

Don’t start killing immediately.
Vent very rarely.
Don’t kill anyone in the passageways.
Follow your impostor mate or let him follow you.
Kill someone privately and let your mate be with you.
Once killed, self report.
This is very cunning now. Target your mate in the discussion. Say he killed the crewmate and self reported. If he gets majority of votes and gets ejected, the crewmates will trust you. They will listen to you and you must take the chance to go on a killing spree. Don’t self report the second time.
Don’t target a crewmate in the discussion. If he gets ejected and everyone comes to know that he isn’t the impostor, then the crewmates will doubt you and vote you the next time.
Sabotage the electric room being there itself. Once somebody comes for repairing, kill him then and there.
If by chance you are caught killing/venting and exposed in the voting time, don’t say “I am not the impostor”. Say “Okay, I and (any colour) are the impostors” or “C’mon (any colour), kill the crewmates”. Note that the ‘any colour’ here DOES NOT refer to the 2nd real impostor, it refers to a lie. This trick can mostly be used if there are 5 to 6 players remaining. You must lie that he is the 2nd impostor by taking actually a crewmate’s name, so that they vite him out. Only 3 to 4 remain and when the 2nd kills 2 to 3, the impostors emerge victorious.
The best thing available- sabotaging the lights. Even if you forget all the above points, this can work. After the game starts and you are an impostor, run towards any room except admin where a huge chunk comes for swiping cards. So go to a lonely place and sabotage lights and kill anyone in the middle (beware of CCTV passageways). After that, run or vent. Don’t report immediately.
Advice: Play it only twice or thrice a week. It fills some kind of demonic energy in me when I play it everyday.

The people who don’t play it must try and enjoy. (I am very sexy and have lots of sexy with sexy women)"

22508,"In it's early days it actually was fun, after airship was added the game kind of fell off, now the menu is a bit glitchy, when i scroll down it twitches. 
Each time i create a lobby it takes forever before someone joins and they usually stay for about 20 seconds and leave, every lobby out there that i've been in always have some broken setup which makes the game no challenge for the impostors and takes the fun out of it.

Running around with high speed, max kill reach and 4 impostors with kill cooldown at probably 10 ain't fun to play against, the lobbies that has 1 or 2 impostors are usually toxic lobbies and has the same problem but with less impostors.

I bought DLC for this game but after the newer update i can't see the things i bought, i have no pets or anything, feel i got straight up scammed, imagine buying DLC just for it to be removed and not even refunded, if it needs to be unlocked it should be specified somewhere at least, even then i see no reason to why you should pay to have a chance of getting that one thing when unlocking stuff.

Game in it's prime is a solid 7/10
Current state of the game is a solid 2/10
Only if you manage to get friends to play it is when it's fun, sadly since the game has gone to shit no one wants to play it."
22509,roles were an awful addition and they turn the game into pure guessing. trying to find a game without roles is a pain in the ass because you cant actively search for a normal game and no one joins newly made rooms

My Name was Jorge Floyd. 

Overall; Great game, cant wait to vent in VR. 

now for some questions! 

Why is Among Us so popular in China?

Because its the only thing that lets them vote, ROLL TIDE!

Why are Germans bad at Among Us?


Because they vent here and vent there.

thank you,

22531,"When I first played among us last year, i would've told you that it is hands-down the most entertaining casual game to ever exist. The mental chess game imposters must play with the crewmates and the paranoia it creates for the crew is on another level of hilarious fun that I've never had in 30 years of gaming. But after reinstalling it yesterday and playing it again, its just endlessly frustrating for imposters because of ONE SINGLE APP ALONE: DISCORD. Every  lobby is filled with people in discord calls together, and this is how its playing out: Crewmates are sticking up for and covering for the imposters in their discord calls and literally just letting them win by throwing the game intentionally so their friends can win. Or, its become impossible for imposters to win because all the dead crew mates are just telling the crew mates still alive who killed them, because again, they're in the same discord call. It has completely, ENTIRELY ruined the experience. On top of that, the vast majority of people who play are so young that they lack both the reasoning skills to figure out imposters on their own, and also lack the maturity to be respectful. I'm not sure why, but Generation Z is obsessed with cyber-bullying. I can't tell you how many lobbies I've been kicked from in the last 24 hours simply because I figured out who the imposters were without cheating, and these little jerks get so upset by EVERYTHING, they lose their minds when they lose and bully the crap out of anyone who sticks up for themselves verbally. It's an awful experience in 2022. Idk what to say, it went from the best casual game ever conceived to the absolute worst. 1/10 because of discord and the entitled little jerks that play it."

It's crazy that they would even enable that, but the fact that I have to enter my SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER OR CREDIT CARD NUMBER to change my birthday or get access to any settings is absolutely insane. This used to be a good game and they have absolutely ruined it with this insanity. Even if they had this sort of thing, the fact that it is impossible to delete or change the account you are logged in with is ridiculously stupid. I would not recommend this game and I hope they lose business for trying to pull something like this. Disgusting"

22588,"ok so first off, I LOVE THIS GAME, Among us is a game of teamwork and betrayal, it has a cartoony artstyle that is appealing to kids, but here are the stuff you might wanna know,
1. There is an in game chat which allows you to talk to players, if you dont have discord that is, some dangerous info can be passed down, but as innersloth said, ""stick to the private lobbies"". Also, you can censor the chat's bad words, so dont worry, it all good, just talk to your child about online safety,
2. Among us is a murder mystery game, meaning there is a murderer on board that tries to kill the entire crew, when the imposter attacks, a little bit of blood is shown on the screen, (no splatters, just a tiny bit of blood as an effect) on the crewmate who got killed's view, there is a brutal animation where the imposter stabs, shoots, impales, or simply snaps the players neck, these animations are a little violent but it wont do anything to a child, also, no blood is shown in these animations.
3. You can find dead bodies where the imposter killed the crewmember, if you find these, you will be put into a meeting which uses the ingame chat to talk about who the imposter is, you can also call a meeting if you see the imposter hop into a vent,
4.The game allows you to buy some ingame cosmetics, which are 3.00 dollars each, but you get a whole lot of cosmetics without buying anything, soooooooooooooo yeah your child wont ask for your credit card,

Common Sense Media rates the game as good for ages 10+ (and it tends to be conservative in its age recommendations). Since the game is easy enough to learn and fun for adults too, you may want to try playing as a family first to see how your kid manages before letting them play online with friends. 
Among Us is an engaging and social game, and it can be a fun way for kids to connect with friends. The Apple Store suggests Among Us is appropriate for kids aged nine and up ! 
Good !"

It a fun game but some kids in ur game can ruin ur game as they will blame the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone and talking non sense to vote kick anyone. so for ur better experience, u are suggested to play with couple friends.10/10, would get blamed by kids for no reason again"

I will say shapeshifter is a bit of a weird addition but that is probably just because I am new to the feature. Love the way it's cross platform. Good game, be warned you may be called sus."

It takes a couple of tries to find the right spot with people who you click with and are able to have fun with but that's why I usually host and try to keep it lighthearted.

22670,"Game *will* initially start, but won't let you correctly enter a birthdate - no matter what your actual entered birthdate is, it records you as being born on January 1, 2021. That means it thinks you need a ""guardian"" to approve you - which requires handing over your credit card info and/or SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER?!?!? Based on the forums, this is a known problem they've refused to fix. It's ridiculous that they're charging for a game with a huge known bug that won't let you make an account without disclosing additional sensitive info. (Seriously, who thought it was OK to be like, hey, give us your SSN or send over a picture of your credit card? Couldn't you, say, go off the fact that I bought the game with a credit card?) If you don't want to forever play as a ""guest,"" with significant limitations on your ability to actually play the game, don't buy this."

Sold it back to them, re-installed it, still hate it.
Never bother installing this if you don't have friends.  This is *only* for people with friends."

22818,I love the game
22819,"I can't fucking take it. I see an image of a random object posted and then I see it, I fucking see it. ""Oh that looks kinda like the among us guy"" it started as. That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a fridge that looked like among us, I'd see an animated bag of chips that looked like among us, I'd see a hat that looked like among us. And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than ""sus."" I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is ""red sus"" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word ""among"" is ruined. The phrase ""among us"" is ruined. I can't live anymore. Among us has destroyed my fucking life. I want to eject myself from this plane of existence. MAKE IT STOP!"

*18+ lobby. I'm seeing a huge divide in ages here, sometimes it's unsettling. 
*Ranked system. This would separate people who care about the game and play a lot from people who just log in to crap away 10 minutes
*Leave lobby timer. Some people leave rooms as soon as they aren't an imposter. Multiple leaves should penalize you at least 2 minutes
*grab boxes on a lot of the tasks are jank. some tweaking to make them more doable would be greatly appreciated"

22890,Fun game that is a great time with friends. I haven't played the game in nearly a year but I sunk a total of 40 some hours into it at the time of this review. I hear the game has gotten better since last I played. Unfortunately the fact that online can be filled with toxicity has kept me from revisiting this game.

22932,"Pretty fun game, a little buggy in reguards to sometimes the loading screens will take a long time and nothing will happen, causing you to half to ctrl-alt-del and close in task manager. Lastly the odds of getting the imposter role seem very low. 20 games i've gotten it 3 times. i hosted a lobby where i set it to have 3 imposters. after 5 games i still didnt get chosen for that role once. i think it needs to be balanced out better. not sure if anything specificly dictates it.

Update at 38 Hours: its very obvious people are in a discord or some third party communication program, working together in-game. i've encountered people walking around with the imposter watching him kill and not reporting it. Heads up to anyone looking to buy the game, this annoying behaviour happens in-game fairly often."
22933,Amogus

22935,This is a really good game but there is a glitch where if you spam the kill button as imposter you can kill early on. People have spawned in as GA because of this and it had just happened to me.

Playing Among Us in real life, spaceship with my crew
Gonna split up, spread out 'cause we all got tasks to do
Gotta find the imposter as they try to sabotage
Who can we trust in this Among Us entourage?
Heard a sound, turned around, looking up, looking down
Then I find a dead body
Gotta blow the horn, emergency discussion, who should we believe?
Can't decide, so, now we leave, not sure what I'm about to see
Will it be a dead body? Still have a task I must complete
Who's the impostеr?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can wе trust?

Looking sus, who can we trust?

Looking sus, who can we trust?
I'm a ghost, I'm my biggest fear, got killed by the imposter
I was playing in the game, but now I'm just a watcher
I'm paying attention using my 360 vision
If it gets quiet, I listen
Make sure there's nothing I'm missing
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?

It wasn't me (or me)
It definitely wasn't me
No one can be trusted because someone is lying
We still have tasks to do, so, let's split up so we can win
Everyone is sus so let this last round begin
There's an imposter among us
Trying to take something from us
We're still over here working
While she's just ghosting above us
Someone's under suspicion
Sabotaging our mission
Doing my task in the kitchen
Until I stop, look, and listen
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?

I'm the I-M-P-O-S-T-E-R, that's me
While everyone's doing tasks, I'm going through vents on a killing spree
Yeah, I'm sus in Among Us
We can discuss whoever took your life
But if you think you're running this game, oh-yeah
That's me holding this knife
I'm the imposter

Finding a game with your squad has been nearly impossible compared to the beginning when the game just came out. All the rooms get filled fast. When we decided to make our own lobby, no one ever joined though we waited for at least 20 minutes. Because of this,  I decided to also stop playing it even though I did find it enjoyable, I might come back when this aint the issue. 

I hope you found this review somewhat helpful or enjoyable! Please also leave a rating and give me your feedback and ideas in the comments. I would love to read your thoughts, ideas or/and your own experiences of playing this game!

23186,"If you have a few good friends then this game is truly awesome, But if you play with random people then your rolling the dice.
Playing with random's can either be just as awesome or an absolute nightmare because of the utter stupidity of people...

23286,"cool game, but gone down in players fast?"
23287,"A fantastic game if you want to create some trust issues with your friends, best friends, brother, sister and family. Highly recommend it if you have ten friend to play with. Sadly playing with stranger is far from the wonderful experience that offers the game with friends.

The maps are well thinking, the mini-game are simple and the control's intuitive."

23289,"i really like this game. before i used to hate as i got bullied for getting good at it they told me to kill myself and i did. i came back alive and slapped my mum silly. this asserted dominance and once everyone in my area heard about this all the women got wet and i ate a bucket of toenails. i decided to play this game again and got so invested i spent all my stripping money on it for skins and my roblox gf. one my mc gf found my minecraft gf left me and took the kids. i was foreced to live on the streets and had to feed off of the rubbish in the back of the Turkish wendys an employee found me drinking the grease off the ground with a straw. i went to a internet cafe and played this game. i hit this CRAZY 360 no scope and got the epic vic roy. this made my parents want to get back together and i ate all the meow meow (wink wink) (im not chineese) all the bullies saw how cracked i was and killed themselfs. i fed off of their families tears (to tyler, mark, ron and tyreese) i hope ur parents take after you. anyway i started streaming this game and my chat consists of porn bot accounts and im doing really successful. my dad came back with the milk.

23303,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

23316,"before i played Among Us, I was wimpy, i was homeless, everyone i knew pushed me away, i slept on the cold city concrete with a cardboard box as my only possession until a man came up to me and gave me a 5 dollar bill. I could have bought food, i could have bought medicine for my sick dog, but instead i purchased a copy of Among Us on Steam, and it changed my life. I got a job, i met my fiance, i am friends with a ton of new (and cooler) Professional Among Us Gamers, and me and my fiance are expecting triplets this December. Among Us changed my Life.

23372,"It may have originally come out in 2018, but Among Us took 2020 by storm, and it's deserving of that spotlight. Innersloth has made the tense, multiplayer fun of in-person cloak and dagger games like Mafia and Werewolf work on PC, mobile, and consoles with a flourish. And the great times I've had slaying, lying, and sleuthing my way through its charming sci-fi world got me wondering why it took so long for this sort of game to catch on. There are still a few technical hitches to be worked out, just like the fussy engines on the Skeld, but that hasn't kept me from coming back to it again and again in my down time.

The premise of Among Us is simple enough that just about anyone can pick it up quickly: eight crew members dash around a claustrophobic, cartoon spaceship to complete simple minigames and fill up a shared progress bar. But among them are two hidden impostors with the goal of secretly murdering everyone until they equal or outnumber the crew and claim victory. And yet, like so many excellent multiplayer games, it's very tricky to master because it’s about fooling real people, not gaming an AI. You can't even fall back on the same successful strategies too often or your opponents will catch on, so sometimes you have to mix things up and maybe even act illogically to keep them guessing."
23373,Bagus bang tapi dah jadi game mati NT
23374,this game is super fun i would play it for 10 hours straight if i wanted to

"
23376,"This game had it's five minutes, time's up bozos."
23377,im not gonna say it
23378,"this one's for you drake

"
23379,"Before it was fun to play, they even added some of the roles and a bunch of fun hats, but now you have to verify yourself as a guardian by giving them part of your social security or credit/debit card. Neither of which they should need, and if you ever sign out or switch to a new laptop you have to do it again.  
If you don't already own it don't bother with it"

23384,it's ok
23385,"I played this game on mobile for ages and only recently tried it out on PC.
At the moment, I would not recommend. What used to be an enjoyable game has been ruined by constant failures to connect to games and freezing both during and after each game. It's become very difficult to even finish a single game and the whole thing has to be restarted like every few minutes. If they fix these issues, they can have a good review from me."

As soon as she left the room crying I busted put laughing because it reminded me of among us a popular video game. So as we were riding in the car I was thinking about saying ""dead body reported"" at the funeral. When we finnaly arived I screamed ""dead body reported"" everyone was looking me like if some sort of a weirdo. Then I remembered that my grandfather's sister fell in the vents and died when she was 2 years old. So I said grandpa's sister sus she vented. My grandfather started crying and everyone was screaming at me instead of laughing. My mom took my x box and said that I am going to therapist tomorow. Idk my mom is acting kinda sus 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"

23415,"This game saved my life.

I am 28.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5  minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are sus very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

23531,"Game play is OK. Game does not use Steam at all for data or account information (so no steam cloud saves). I've had problems with my account, but it is not possible to create a new account, nor delete my account. Customer service from Among Us is non-existent. Emailing support justs gets a generic response with no actual customer support available. If your account gets messed up, you can never play the game again. Uninstalling and re-installing the game has no effect as Among Us stores account information in the cloud."

23557,so much fun for such a low price really recommend.
23558,"I haven't played this game for a while, but as I have 211 hours on it I felt it only necessary to give my thoughts on this game.

The game-play is great. The art design is great. The music is iconic. These are all great aspects of the game. 

What makes this game amazing, and why I heavily recommend it, is because of the memories and the friends I've made for life from this game. It will always have a place in my heart for that reason, and that reason alone.

... I lied. Amoggus meme sus

23635,This game makes you realize that your circle of friends has probably only gotten smaller since college and getting more than maybe 3 other people together for any sort of a game night is a task only slightly more difficult than surgery. However that isn't the dev's fault so I give this game a 5/4. Super fun if you have friends.

23659,"Among Us changed my life. It helped me to process my feelings of isolation and gain the courage to leave the house again. It became my daily affirmation that I am not alone. That there are others with experiences as different as I am. And ultimately, it gave me the courage to create my own personal website, a place where I could share my story, give advice, and make a connection.

And that is why my audience matters to me. I was shortly arrested by the FBI. I’ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. I still have flashbacks and panic attacks. I have a voice, but I need the right platform to use it.

No More Taboos, No More Stigma

The first episode of No More Taboos, No More Stigma aired in July of 2014. As the new ""main character,"" I take a week to work through my recovery. At the end of the week, I leave the show for two weeks.

With the show, I have the ability to connect with so many people. Last year, the show reached people in all 50 states and 21 countries. There have been over 500,000 views of the show. But while the show is making an impact, I still struggle with the stigma surrounding mental health.

23688,sussy baka
23689,Until InnerSloth fixes the linking account issue I wouldn't recommend this game. You have no way of linking your steam account without the website claiming you don't have an account to link it's especially hard if you bought the DLCs previously leave the game for a while and come back to the newest update. This makes the money you spent not worth it. I doubt the DEVS will fix this issue seeing as it hasn't been patched or anything.

23737,"Among Us is a game that will never get old. Even with memes, remixes, and criticism, it still goes on. This is the exact path Fall Guys went through, but Among Us just handled it better. I preferably think Among Us is better than Fall Guys, which explains the sudden rise of Among Us, and decline of Fall Guys. Among Us is a party game you can play for years and never get bored, because all mechanics are meant to be replayable, which Fall Guys obviously couldn't pull off. Among Us is a good 6.5/10 to me though. The game is definitely above average, just not on levels of Adventure Pals, and Among the sleep, which I think are little bit higher."

23858,"[h1] Fun in Small Doses [/h1]

I don't even know why I'm reviewing this; everyone knows about this game. It's a living meme at this point, and it's pretty obvious that this game would be a shadow of itself if it weren't for COVID, but it is fun with the right group of people in short bursts. It's not a game that's conducive to hours of fun, it can get very samey, and the charm is completely lost on random lobbies, but the experience with friends is good enough to warrant some game time every now and then. It's free, so all you've got to lose is a few minutes of free time.

23887,"I remember when this game first started grabbing everyone's attention my group of friends would be playing this nonstop for a few hours at a time but coming back now it feels like they lost what made the game so great by removing the core functionality of chat in the game.  previously in among us, you could have free reign to type whatever you wanted to confuse/lie/mislead the crewmates into believing you were innocent but now it's been replaced by this strange system reminiscent of the club penguin ultra-safe chat where you have selected dialogue options to choose from. It just ended up making the game a mess from both the crew and imposter sides as nobody was able to properly communicate which was the key to winning before. TLDR; This game has fallen from grace"
23888,I would recommend it if you don't mind spending $3. But for god sake just pirate it if you just want to play with your friends

23897,"There's a Imposter among us!
"
23898,"Now, Among Us is everyone's favorite game. That is just a known fact, and it's not wrong.
Among Us has a good game mechanic from games like ""Town of Salem"" and ""Mafia"", but it takes those ""hidden roles"" and places a bunch of simplicity on it, making it accessible and understandable for those of younger child (very good move there based on the community)
Now one of my all time favorite singers (corpse husband) played this game, and to my surprise, even he enjoyed hiding his roles behind a mask, and getting tasks done.
If you think the game is all happy though, you'd be wrong.
The game is made for kids. Meaning kids have control over servers, and this game has a terrible single player option, (including no lore)
It basically forces you to sign up so you can see funny stuff in chat, and also is becoming a Pay To Win game. Which isn't terrible in itself, as it's just cosmetics, but all thirteen of my hours were grinding for the cat ears.
Good game, would play again, has it's quirks on the community though,"

23960,"Among us is a very fun murderer scene game. This game is also on mobile, but the PC version is also very good for these reasons. If you get the game on PC you get free cosmetics that would usually cost money on mobile. The PC version has achievements, so if you are like me and are addicted to collecting achievements then the PC version is for you. Among us is a very fun game to play with your friends and by yourself. Among us on the PC is only 5 dollars. Most PC games are usually 20+ dollars. So I recommend this super fun game!"

23988,"Unless you have a group of friends to play with, playing this game with strangers is, most of the time, the biggest waste of time I have ever been a part of. People just quickly leave servers, don't know how to play the game, throw out racial slurs, and the masses of tweens trying to find an online girlfriend. Worth the cheap price for an occasional good game, but it is frustrating to play quite often."
23989,"Wanted to play Among Us again after almost a year, turns out I can't use free chat (and by extension play with friends) because I just clicked next on the default age (January 2022) and there is no way to change it without showing off credit card info or my ID (which I don't think would even work since I'm not from America).

24078,A great game for its value. The meme may be dead but updates are every month or two. It is a fair time to wait for the content they give us aswell as making it possible for mobile players to have roles aswell.

24094,"This used to be a good game, but then they started updating it and they just ruined it. Now its impossible to actually connect to lobbies let alone be able to stay in a lobby for more than 5 minutes without disconnecting! It lags constantly, and there are numerous lighting/graphics glitches that are just annoying. 

However, the worst thing is the player base, they are the most stupid, dumb, racist, vile idiots that I have ever had the displeasure of playing a game with. If you say one thing that someone doesn't like (even if its stupid and/or minor) the room owner instantly kicks you out, Even if everyone else is saying the most racist and vile shiz, you (who is probably asking what everyone's collective IQ level is) gets kicked out. Even if you don't say anything offensive. If you play this game, be prepared to be singled out and have the most vile and racist comments thrown at your face. 

If you play on public lobbies because you don't have many friends to play with, every room you enter will have a group of people with a collective IQ of -100. I am NOT joking. 100% of the time, you WILL run in to people who are vile, people who have the IQ of Jar Jar Binks, people who chat random shiz that makes no sense, and ***holes who randomly blame people with no context. The player base is stage 3 Lung cancer caused by years of smoking mixed with black lung from working in the coal mines and agent orange exposure from the Vietnam War."

24135,"[4/10] Ehh it's nothing special, but it's good to play a couple of rounds every now and then with friends. I wouldn't play with randos though."
24136,"The updates are making the game worse and everyone is brain dead in public lobbies, overall its more frustrating then fun 2/10"
24137,"Whenever they bring out a update their servers fail from the amount of people playing which is good for them but not for people who want to play and they fail normally sometimes. then you have the players who can be funny, nice or really annoying.

Anyway the gameplay is really good with the tasks the maps and the roles. The customisations are really good and you can do some funny things with them. Really good/fun game playing alone or with friends."

24185,This game is awsome i love being imposter cause you get 2 roles now instead of 1
24186,This game was only fun if you'd never played any other social deduction game before
24187,The game you can lie and cheat out your friends there is no less than a fun time to have in this game absolutly love this game wining or losing just join with your friends and have some fun is one of the best games over the past couple of years and finding people dead to rights is way to much fun.
24188,"No longer enjoyable. The new roles honestly ruined it for me. There's bots, lots of them, and there's several issues. I keep disconnecting for no reason and I have to say, my internet is FINE, it's the GAME. Also, the new cube stuff is honestly boring, ngl. What do you do? Win games? Hard to do that when you're always disconnecting. This game has downgraded, I liked it when it was just crewmate and imposter. But hey, we can gaslight other people. That's always,, fun."

24256,"""help, I've, (been) stabbed""

This quote is where i would like to start my Among Us review. As the new year begins, I predict a place for this game yet again  on the top ten games of the year, and here's why: 

Now before I write to much, I must preface that I've recently eaten mochi; a popular Japanese desert. And this is important because I found that mochi often resembles the Among US physique. So in other words I may have eaten the impostor. I don't know if that makes me the impostor, so i would like to first plead my case: I am innocent, there was luckily no red mochi. 

Additionally, I may have discovered Among Us gummy edibles on amazon, and I may or may not have an open bag next to me. I feel a little weird but that might just be the weed, but I'm not sure. Please guys I swear I'm not the impostor. 

Hmm. You know I've also recently been very into the color red. I just painted my ceiling red and the walls and the floor and my family and my fence. But I swear I'm innocent, it was just a weird impulse. 

Oh yeah, and i also should mention that knives have been protruding from my stomach when i get near someone, I was going to get it checked out, but it killed my doctor? I hid the body, it should be fine. 

Hmm, you know what, I'm kind of hungry still but i just ate neighbor... IN A COMPLETELY NORMAL WAY, don't freak out, i swear I'm really innocent and very much not the impostor. You know what, after I snort this line, im going to eat my family! What a marvelous idea, easy access to blood!

24260,Very good game I love it
24261,Easy recommend if you have friends to play with. Fun
24262,"Among Us (coloquially termed ""amogus"") teaches us to punish the minority and hate those who are different and unique as ""impostors."" Instead, I like the breath of fresh air this problem provides as a new perspective on deduction that is not ""red is sus, red vented, etc."" that has been dominating the jokes of my peers and the view of my feed. Yet, by trying to force this problem to conform to ""amogus,"" you yourself are trying to crush originality and uniqueness. Among Us is a game ultimately convincing us to conform to menial labor as ""tasks"" and accept the deal of being just like the rest of the crewmates."

24299,"Concerned parent here. This game has tore my family apart. My son has committed 3 CRIMES after playing this game. Those 3 crimes have all been murder. He says that he needs to be ""sus"" and is the ""impostor"". My son KILLED my husband and told me that I can't ""report"" the body other wise the other crewmates will think he is ""sus"" and that he would be ""ejected"". This game has completely corrupted my son, he would of never done ANYTHING like this before playing this game. I am so dissapointed that this game is still on the store. It is making kids the ""impostor"" and they are literally committing crimes. Why is this still up?

24318,"this game is good. however, innersloth decided to put in QUICK CHAT,
which just straight up RUINED the game on mobile. i can understand it on
console, but MOBILE, let alone PC!? bruh. quick chat just makes it harder
to tell your side of the story, and takes longer cuz instead of typing, you gotta
go through a menu, and it becomes hard  to find what you are trying to say.

but still buy this game, good game overall, very fun (especially as an impostor),
and the new roles made it even more fun to play, whether with friends, or strangers.

(P.S.: quick chat can be turned off on PC if u sign in with your Steam account, and
on mobile with Google Play Games.)"

24344,"As a person who has lots of sex all the time, I can say that this game is 100% accurate to having sex with sexy women like I do everyday. This game did not make me horny however. I just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 15 minutes in this game. On the other hand I would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me because I have lots of sex with women a lot) as there is a naked woman in it and she is naked. She kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who I have sex with a lot. I have lots of sex. I also an very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because I am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. All my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. One of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but I told her I was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and gameended herself because I did not have sex with her. I have sex with women. Not sometimes men. I am also gay. I am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because I am very cool and sexy. My penis is very big. All my girlfriends like my penis because it's very big and I am very good at sex with my women. Every woman I've had sex with is very sexy and so am I. I have lots of sex. I'm also very handsome and sexy and I have lots of sex."

24356,"This game is honestly one of the worst I've played. Just a bad twist on murder mystery except you think everybody is suspicious except for the one person that is imposter, then you vote out the person you think is suspicious and they aren't imposter. That process repeats until only the imposter is left which is the only person that isn't suspicious. In this game are a bunch of people that mentally manipulate people to thinking they are innocent. I hate it when I'm doing a task and somebody walks towards me, then I'm waiting for the kill sound and animation which jumpscares me and makes me have a seizure. I seriously don't know why people still play this game. 0/10

Edit: Even the name ""Among us"" gives me goosebumps every time I hear it, seriously makes me contemplate life and who to trust. -1/10"

24378,"This game saved my life.

I am 38.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.
Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
24379,sussy game with sussy imposters but they have added sussy roles so that makes the game less sussy. but the people who play it are quite sussy
24380,"MOGUS
"
24381,yes
24382,XD Best hit game of 2021
24383,"Its a epic great and popular game With some new roles!

Crewmate: Do your tasks and vote off the impostor
Engineer: A crewmate who can vent like the imp
Scientist: Crewmate who can check who is alive and dead

Impostor: Kill the crewmates to win
Shapeshifter: A impostor that can shapeshift


"
24384,sussy
24385,"its cool and all really recommend it, the servers often act sus but allow it, cool 5/5"
24386,"The game is very fun (sometimes). When I first got the game and created an account it wouldn't let me log in so i deleted it from my account, readded it and launched it, it let me play. I recommend this game but if you want mods those will be external. Buy the game when it is on sale (if you feel like waiting) so a cheaper price. You can play cross platform with one account, on mobile, switch, pc ,etc. all consoles with the game are able to join the same server. If there was a star rating, 4 stars."
24387,help me.. please
24388,It's fun. An usually best if you know the people you're playing with.
24389,fun :)

24473,"It's fucking among us, no one plays this game anymore"
24474,"I love it so much plus i have a headach.
"
24475,"Despite this game becoming a meme, and the general opinion of a large group of people on the internet saying ""haha, amogus bad"" I still think this game is great and a blast to play with friends. The fact that the devs have been updating this game and adding new content is amazing.
I spent 40 hours in about two weeks time farming this game to get the Steam achievements when that update came out. Personally, if you are to play this game I suggest finding some friends in a discord server to play with along with you. Public lobbies are fine, but you're not getting the full experience with them.
I know this game isn't exactly under the radar by any means, but I've seen too many people on the internet call this game dumb because of the memes. It's perfectly fine to not like this game, it is perfectly fine to be annoyed by how much popularity this game has, but if you're one of those people who played this game for 20 or so hours, laughed, had fun, and then a few months later decided to shit on this game because of its popularity I honestly can't take you seriously.
Fun game. Thank you Innersloth for this chaotic mess of a game, looking forward to more content in the future."

24649,"Honestly, I had high expectations about this game once it started getting popular. at first, i did find it boring, but after a bit of playing, it's actually pretty fun. although, i am having problems with the game just a few days after purchase. when I sign in, my game freezes and i'm not allowed to play online (only local). The only way I could play is if I sign in as guest. I have tried uninstalling the game and then installing, and then restarting my laptop. Other than that, it still is a pretty good game. also, there are a lot of My Hero Academia (MHA) servers that appear when trying to look for a game. approach with caution, they will ban you if you don't have a MHA name. that is all. have a good day :)"

24667,Its a good game but do not let 5 years old or younger play because of the gore because there is blood and guns and knives and stabbings and shooting
24668,"I was playing among us at 2:42 am and as I was about to enter electrical the susman came up and killed me. This expierence along with many others has resulted in me growing paranoid. This is not just in the game, I have expierenced severe paranoia at work, school, and at home. Whenever my wife wears her favorite pink blouse, I think of pink who killed me in the double imposter round on airship. This game has given me ptsd and am now seeking therpy. Before you buy this game remember among us is very sus."

In case you've been living under a rock, this strategy-lying based action-ish game is quite the experience, filled with 9 year olds, but when you find a good lobby and you get good people, you know the bases of the game are rock solid and absolutely beautifully good. When you're an imposter, you lie to your friends, when you're crewmate, you have to try to keep yourself in the game while figuring out who the imposter is. Murder mystery-style. Extremely reccomend this, get it for yourself and your friends.

For the love of susmogus, don't f***ing cheat."

24694,"Among Us surprised me. I didn’t know this game existed until one of my friends urged me to pick it up and I’m glad I did. Among Us is a hidden role deduction game where up to 10 players are preparing their ship. You can either be randomly be a crewmate or an imposter. Crewmates are given a list of tasks, which can either be quick or long, that they should do. While they’re traveling all around the map, keeping their eyes open is key as they can walk past a dead body, even walk in on the imposter doing imposter-only actions, and making sure that crisis are taken care of. If you find a dead body, you’ll get the option to report it and be sent to the discussion table so you can relay where you found it, who maybe was in the area or left, and hear what the others have to say in relation to alibis. You can also vote who you think the imposter is and if the majority agrees, they’ll get ejected. Though, you can hit the emergency meeting button if you have some juicy information. If you happen to be killed, or wrongly voted off, you can still do your tasks. Dead crewmates unfinished tasks still count in everyone’s combined completion bar. There are also areas where you can loosely monitor everyone with security cams, a heart monitor, or detectors that loosely detect how many people are in a room or the thresholds they passed.

Meanwhile, imposters (which can be between 1-3 depending on the host) need to blend in. They’re given a list of fake tasks so they can go to the station and pretend they’re doing it, but you won’t actually get the screen. Of course, you need to make sure that nobody notices that the shared completion bar isn’t moving when you’re “doing tasks”. If you believe you and a crewmate are alone, and hopefully no one is going to come right around the corner, you can kill them and widdle down the cremate’s numbers (assuming the cooldown is done). You can also sabotage the crewmates by locking doors and causing crisis that will kill the crewmates if they don’t deal with it or hamper them such as lowering their visibility. You can also jump into vents to quickly get out of an area and act like you totally weren’t there or hide and suddenly jump out when a poor lone sole walks along. Hopefully, no one walks in on you or keep everyone’s suspicions off you and on someone else.

For the crewmates to win, they either have to find and vote out all impostors or have everyone complete their tasks. While imposters can win by killing most of the crewmates (if the number of impostors equal cremates, the impostors win) or hope that the crewmates totally ignore the crisis."

24725,Kinda Sus!?
24726,"the community is rlly bad. people will randomly vote eachother at the start of the game. and its really annoying. Alot of people can probably agree with me on this. Its not the devs fault, but i think its because of the quick chat. I think that the quick chatis a bit unecessary. I do hope that the people playing the game will be better. ty for reading! I do reccommend playing if ur lucky to get a server thats good. <3"
24727,Fun with the right people and can be fun with randoms but some people just toxic and not fun to play with but if you got a group of chill fun friends its pretty cool

Knowing when to lie is the key to winning. I don't know what they was thinking adding 3 different shades of pink to the game (Dark Pink,Rose,Coral).Biggest problem is people call emergency meetings as soon as the game starts for no reason."

I have to agree simply because you can't even play it by yourself, so if no friends or friends that will play it with you, don't bother."
24755,"fun game,just annoying when people leave"
24756,"First lets start with my dislikes.
 1: I wish the scientist and engineer roles had more of a use.
 2: I wish there where more roles.
 3: I wish you didn't get disconnected randomly so much.

Now to the thing I like about the game
 1: the two teams head to head aspect.
 2: the amount of thinking and detective work you have to do as a crew member is not to much but not to little.
 3: the skill required as an imposer is just right.
 4: the roles add a little extra thing to the game.    

 All in all the game is a perfect bled of strategy, difficulty, and fun. It's a great game to play when you have noting to do or any other time."

The other day my teacher was teaching us Greek Mythology and he mentioned a pegasus and I immediately thought 'Pegasus? more like Mega Sus!!!!' and I've never wanted to kms more. I can't look at a vent without breaking down and fucking crying. I can't eat pasta without thinking 'IMPASTA??? THATS PRETTY SUS!!!!' Skit 4 by Kanye West. The lyrics ruined me. A Mongoose, or the 25th island of greece. The scientific name for pig. I can't fucking take it anymore.

Please fucking end my suffering."
24962,"The epitome of 'better with friends', I've had so much fun playing with this with a group.  It is simple enough for anyone, even non-gamers, to get into.  It is a great way to bring people together even if they can't be together.   This is a timeless classic that won't easily be replaced."

Item #: SCP-5167

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Foundation web-crawlers are to monitor online communities for mentions of potential SCP-5167 sightings. In cases where these sightings are confirmed, all direct witnesses are to be apprehended and all secondary evidence removed from the platform in question.

Apprehended witnesses are to be held until symptoms of SCP-5167 abate, and are then to be amnesticized and released under a standard 'mental breakdown' cover story.

Description: SCP-5167 is an entity known to manifest as a player of the online multiplayer game Among Us under the username of 'Phthonus'.

SCP-5167 will randomly join multiplayer lobbies of the game and participate as an ordinary player would, with the majority of its anomalous effects only becoming obvious following the initial encounter. During this initial encounter, SCP-5167 has been observed to communicate using the in-game chat function, although the majority of its speech consists of lengthy diatribes produced at little prompting from other players.

Individuals who interact with SCP-5167 in-game will subsequently begin to exhibit symptoms of paranoia and Capgras delusion1. The severity of these symptoms varies from person to person, but in initial cases was significant enough to prompt acts of perceived self-defense from those affected2. These symptoms persist for a period initially believed to encompass several months, but has lessened to one or two weeks as observation has continued.

SCP-5167 was initially discovered by the Foundation after a period during which the player 'Phthonus' was a minor urban legend in the Among Us community. Although interest in the figure died down fairly quickly, Foundation web-crawlers flagged recorded accounts of player encounters with the entity as potential anomalous phenomena. Learning Computer Psi-2 (""Meville"") was assigned to track sessions of the game until SCP-5167 was encountered — and when the other players in said session were tracked down, they exhibited the symptoms now associated with SCP-5167.

Foundation efforts to track the individual behind SCP-5167 have thus far proven unsuccessful — all attempts to locate the internet access point used by the anomaly have led to deserted home addresses in rural Greece."

red sus
red sus in the vents tonight
red sus
red sus in the vents tonight

start the game, wasn't an imposter
walking down, take a swipe to right
now the sussy crew slowly retreats
to the shadows out of sus

walking past the boxy mountains
saw the body on top of lights
looked behind, saw that red was jumping
in the vents out of sight

only one imposter killed
if not him it's me
vote red out first red he killed
then you'll see I'm clear

when the bar is low
and reactors on
red just waits to see who's left

red so sussy
in the vents again
why did I get sacrificed?

when the task blows through
going really fast
imposter jumps out of the vent

when the game ends
i will tell you that
red sus in the vents tonight"

25162,"In my professional opinion, Among us has changed how we see video games since the trend to play it on media such as Twitch and Youtube. I belive that we will not get a game that will suprise us like Among us in the next decade or two. Among us is a piece of art that proves my thoery that games do not need fancy graphics but insteed needs gameplay that is fair and stands out from the majority of other games on this platform. I nor Innersloth accepts critism towards this game and if you think diffrent then you will go to the gulag. 

My friends often like to put either a knife in me or abuse their power of friendship and gets the trust from the shitbags that is my lovely friends.
There is finally a game that allows me to dress up as a pink Jelly bean with glasses and a doctors outfit while I violently suck the life out of my poor old friends.

8.4/10 would recommend."

25207,After playing it for a good amount of time I can say it is a great game to play with friends and enjoy together. Public lobbies are not fun at all in my opinion but it is still playable. The best you can do is play in a full private lobby with discord or Teamspeak. I can recommend it.

Miracles from heaven. The single best videogame experience of this century, if not of the whole mankind.

Let's talk about the graphics. They are stunning, it's an eye candy and I certainly am glad to put my gaming rig to work with this beast. The graphics are important, remember that!

The story is surprising, but right. The writers outdid themselves here - so there is this crewmate, who is an Imposter and though he is too sus, to my tastes, I still loved it!

The OST is fantastic, every time I play it, I get goosebumps and flashbacks to my childhood when my dad was beating me with the belt.

And what about the cultural impact, you might ask? Well, governments have agreed to withdraw nuclear arms race just to be able to play some Among Us, kids in school no longer study Fortnite skins, and they have Among Us to thank for that.

I love Among Us, I play Among Us, I breathe Among Us because I want to be Among us. Your boyfriend, your dead grandmother, and even your local game journalist can enjoy this piece of history and masterpiece. 5/5

25275,"Im leaving a negative review, but not because it is a bad game but because of the god awful connection issues. This is only a negative review to bring this issue more to light and make it more likely to be fixed. The issue is joining games takes multiple attempts due to connection errors, meaning sometimes you wait 10 minutes to be able to have a chance to join a game. Its not my internet as i know many people run into this issue, and i have great connection in most cases.

25311,"It’s a Grate game, one of my suggestions is that maybe it should have a role of a spawner imposter that spawns an crewmate dummy of either a life crewmate or dead one. Dummy would probably go away after a meeting. Also when doing clear vent task peps might see us sus sooo yeah"

25345,"OK, look. You need to change the typing system back, Sure it was annoying when people were a-sholes, But the new one is WAY to clunky and annoying to get threw. the new engineer role where you can vent as a crew mate is a great idea, (and makes it so that whenever you get the crew mate role you don't role your eye's) Though there's a big problem, With the new typing system you cant try to convince people that you are just a engineer, The only options you have is to either say nothing... so that will get you killed, OR you can just lie and say you didint vent, thats also probably gonna get you killed, But other then then those to issues, its still pretty fun,

25432,"I'd give it a 7/10 and heres why it deserves a 7/10
Reason One: The game gets boring after like 1 match or 2 matches, but is entertaining.
Reason Two: Missing/Not A lot of Mechanics, Its a great thing they added keybinds but there should be more mechanics and new tasks.
Reason Three: Updates doesn't come out as fast, if we gotten updates like every few week we would be on version 2021.20.5 right now.
Still a great game, hope it gets new things to come."

The website it takes you to then ask you to either put in the last 4 digits of your SSN or a debit card to verify that you are an adult. On top of that it removed items that I had bought years ago so that I can re-buy it. Incredibly scummy.

25536,"A non-game created, marketed, and catered to mobile users that feels shallow, uninspired, and very limited in scope.

Positive:
- Animations are basic but smooth, movement is ordinary but fluid, and the frame rate runs solidly at the desirable 144 frames per second.
- At the time of this writing, the playerbase includes a large minimum daily peak of about 10,000 concurrent players across the world, and this does not include those playing outside of Steam. In addition, most players are friendly and play the objectives.
- Interacting with other people within the context of the game, for the purposes of solving or perpetrating crimes, is a social experiment that showcases the effects of gullibility factors on interpersonal relationships.

Neutral:
- Some of the minigames can be confusing to complete, at first, since how to successfully achieve their goals is never actually described.
- Many gameplay mechanics are not explained, requiring further reading of the wiki to gain an understanding of what could be performed.
- There are plenty of funny and cute cosmetics to choose from, with most being obtainable with the in-game currency that is earned through play experience points.
- Running around the map and working on tasks is far too simplistic to be enjoyable. This aspect of the game entails doing unrewarding busy work for no other reason than to be placed in a position of vulnerability in order to be murdered or to notice the questionable behavior of the impostors.
- Attempting to witness assassinations or, at the very least, to gather visual evidence of the perpetrator committing a crime is relatively amusing and challenging, but the voting element is anticlimactic and interruptive.
- As an impostor, lying to and manipulating innocent crewmates can be farcical, initially, but after a while, the devious acts begin to seem wrong and uncomfortable.
- All gameplay mechanics eventually fall flat and become dull somewhat quickly. Completing simple tasks around static maps becomes boring sooner or later.
- Environments and situations could potentially be promising and entertaining, but the actual interactions between players and locations are extremely cursory.
- Nothing truly interesting really happens. Every match is essentially the same, with the same occurrences, with the same discussions, and with the same outcomes.

Negative:
- The developers collect a huge amount of data from the playerbase. This includes device IDs, IP addresses, Internet geolocation information, dates of birth, software and hardware configurations, etc. Opting out of this collection is available, but the extent of the breach of privacy remains uncertain.
- This is a mobile or tablet game and some menus still have references to such devices, asking the player to ""tap"" instead of to ""click"".
- An error preventing players from unlocking free in-game items occurs at most attempts. There is nothing that could be done about this except for trying to unlock the items again later with hope that it finally works.

Overall rating: 3.0/5.0"

25561,"so with a heavy heart i decided for a negative review, while the game itself especially with friends is extremely fun and even with randoms you can have a great time. Innersloth is sadly completely unable to manage games.
Why?
- server issues. exactly a year now, i wanna say they got better and yet they are still way to regular. in a game where you literally can destroy complete rounds with server instability it should be the biggest focus and even for a smaller studio possible to provide more stability than currently given.
- promising features over a year ago that now got forgotten? while a ton of other unimportant stuff got added? great
- there are way better and more server efficient ways to manage lobbies. that got suggested to them a good year ago, yet nothing changed.

literally the only positive thing Innersloth managed in the past 12 month is they got probably rid of all or most hackers, coz i havent encountered any at all recently, which is at least one good thing and definitely positively impacting the fun in public games."

edit: after playing some more again, there are at least 5-6 glitches and bugs that were present 1 year ago and not fixed either...

edit 2: i am honstly more and more disappointed by the inability of innersloth at managing this game. The most laughable error messages that kick you out of lobbies and dont get fixed but hey at least more shit to earn money got added.  like right now few min ago i literally got kicked from the lobby for shapeshifting as shapeshifter ... and here i thought its the fricking purpose of a shapeshifter to idk ? shapeshift?"

25607,SUS
25608,"This game is really fun but also really challenging at the same time, mostly when you are an imposter. And the last couple of updates have made the game's psycological part a lot more difficult, because of the engeneer that can vent, which was a key evidence to find an imposter, and the shapeshifter, who can kill as somebody else. I would rate this game as a 4.25 out of 5"

25613,"Terrible Game I keep getting killed, my friends says ""Just trust me"" But always kills me anyways."
25614,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

25651,"An addicting game tainted by little kids and rude people. There are fun moments when people in public lobbies actually try to play detective and scout out the impostors but other times it's absolute chaos. Wonderful and discording chaos. I would play with friends [strike] if I had any [/strike] but public lobbies are just such a marvelous sight to see. Public lobbies are mostly summed up as: person wanting to find impostor, impostor actually trying, other impostor not trying at all, people not doing anything/afk, people role playing, little kids on their parents' ipad spouting out absolute nonsense, and people wanting to hook up with others. 

This game has changed a lot though. It's been memed to oblivion and at moments I can't think about the word ""vent"" in any other way except correlating with this game. Weird, funny, and chaotic game that led me to wonderful people in my life. :)"

25797,is there more sexual tension between jessie and woody or bo and woody. They make woody and bos relationship very public but theres just to much going on between jessie and woody were not seeing. For startes they are both cowgirls/boys and thats just the start of it. they have so muc hmoer in common. Im all for woody and bo but man that love triangle would be steamy. And just for the fun of it you could even throw buzz in there. I mean ure not thinking they havent experimented in college or anything? Just a wee bit sus. And has anone else noticed that breath of the wid girls all moan no matter what. Idk but overall tf2 is a fun game

25947,Amazing game to play with friends.
25948,The game is super boring and super repetitive. You will enjoy it probably for the first few hours that you play it (if you are playing with friends) and then you will never end up touching the game again.

25954,"Generally, i like the game. Some of the people, and chat's inside the game? Not so much. The game is not very child friendly when it comes to server names, and chats. If you want this for your children, do automated responses. Do not allow your child to be in a free chat lobby. I do like that you can regular Among us, but also be able to play HideNSeek lobbies so that you can have a thrill of offing the crew before they finish task without being reported. It is like a race! It's a love hate relationship for Among Us."
25955,rly good
25956,IT BE FUN Y'ALL!!!!!
25957,even though now its dead in a way it's still a really fun game. Not only that today i am on my brand new gaming computer and it works very well. P.S it also works well on crappy computers like my old computer it ran very well.

Voice chat is an absolute must to use if you want to get the full experience. What i however do have to say is that the public games have gone down greatly in terms of playability due to people dropping out the moment they see they are not the imposter, some of this was fixed by the new role possibility update, however this has pushed the game more towards 'town of salem' play.

26148,"Good party game, sucks if you play it alone (especially given that people group up frequently and actively work against how the game is supposed to be played). Doing tasks sucks. The most fun you can have on this game is either being an impostor, playing with friends, or viciously cyberbullying people."
26149,"I don’t play among us any day
The game creates hate that never decays
I’ll play any other game for eight hours straight
For among us is the root of hate
I will never play that game
But for Vili, he will be playing till he has a cane
I am not the one to blame to hate this game
But it is the creators that cause people true pain

26156,the new update? Awesome!
26157,"If you have friends who also are willing to play then it's a great game. However, it is important to know that you can get the mobile version for free so I'd suggest you get that instead."
26158,"When it comes to party games with friends this game is at the top. Now if you dont have many friends at all and i mean like minimum 7 other people to play with you wont enjoy this game at all. the random queue is just trolls and people with the IQ of a toaster so its not recommended to spend money on a game like that, just buy the mobile version which is free. Now if you do have plenty of friends to go around this is definitely the game for you. Nothing says friendship more than pointing fingers at each other and swearing on god you arent lying when in fact you are because youll do whatever it takes to win. best way to describe why this game is fun? ask yourself: why is mario kart so fun among friends?"

I think if Innersloth did a huge update and added something like different game modes or something I believe a lot of players would come back and the game would pick up traction once more. However, Innersloth did not do this and the game is quite boring and old so if you've never played it, play one game and find your opinion but i'm going to say to not get the game and to wait to see if the creators so something with it.

26282,"Among Us is a game similar to the game many of us have played in our childhood, which some may know as Mafia or Werewolf. Among Us takes the basic aspects of that game and makes them into an extremely fun ""who did it"" game for anyone to enjoy. Weather you are a crewmate or the impostor, there is layers to each. When playing as a innocent crewmate, you have multiple tasks scattered across the map you are playing on. It adds a layer to being innocent instead of just hoping you don't die. If every crewmate completes their tasks or the impostor(s) are voted out, the game is won. Having win conditions makes the impostor(s) have to work quick on their feet, and gives the crewmates a much better chance. The game always offers something new to think about every round. Who is the impostor? Is anyone dead? Who is lying? Among Us makes every round interesting, and offers infinite replay value. It is extremely entertaining and worth the purchase."

26284,"Even though the game is involved in many shitty memes, still fun to do a round with the lads"
26285,its good
26286,"SUSSY BALLS!!! SUSSY PENIS!!!!

26289,Uhm it's a good game
26290,"If you have a group of friends on a Discord server that you can play with, this game is solid.  I enjoy the new features (engineer, shape shifter, etc.).  It adds a layer of complexity to a simple, fun game!"

26299,was fun i guess surprised that i even have 8.5 hours. idk game was ok at first and then people just started yelling at each other ever round so they kinda killed the vibe
26300,amongsus
26301,This is one of those games that you bought and have in your steam library but never play.
26302,"Great game that shows concept is more important than fancy graphics. Reminds me of an old school network game called pacwars. so simple yet fun, especially with friends."
26303,Gogogus
26304,"no,no"
26305,"Everyone seems to be very rude on this game, maybe because it's all young pre-teens looking for attention but it's bizarre how on every lobby I join almost every-time everyone is just rude, it's insane."
26306,"good

26307,I just didnt like it.

26317,"t first you play the game, then you see all the cute little coloured characters, you enjoy the game maybe play it a little too much, so so much in fact that you hop off the game but the characters oh the simply designed characters you start seeing them everywhere you go on your phone you see a picture of a fire alarm and it looks like the red character; funny maybe just a little funny but then you see more more objects being posted, posted everywhere every social media app you can't escape you go outside and you see a red bin with a silver swinging lid that looks like thee

26336,this game sucks they always go after us so don't get this game it is also over priced
26337,i kept shapeshifting into the same person and they got voted out even though i was the main suspect this game is so cool
26338,STOP BEING SUS
26339,seriously a fun game honestly. This game was mainly standard murder mystery game until a content drop and unlike mods they made it balanced such as instead of medic reviving they just see when you die and engineer can use vents having a cool down instead of also being able to fix sabotages. Due to the content nuke the games more fun in public and not as tedious. Also its kinda funny how every game now has a battle pass.
26340,Boring + i don't have friends
26341,among us
26342,Good Game
26343,the game is really funny to pass the hour i died from laugh and it even funnier when play with friends so it worth to buy it

26361,"I think the game is really fun, can't find the version that I can mod it though, for Crewlink and extra roles.
but one thing the game needs is an adding system. I met some amazingly sweet people last night on December 22nd 2021
there names at the time were Fox, Zero and Faceless. they were fun but I couldn't find the same game after my PC couldn't handle anymore things open <3"

26385,"Game is filled with mongoloids and mouth breathers. Game glitches every third or fourth game you play so you can't press the use or kill button, making the game LITERALLY unplayable. Also, you get people who are actual cheaters/hackers (e.g. if you ever see the player name UwU, he's a notable cheater) and people who glitch themselves purposely. For a game that actually costs money, I can't recommend this. I would actually discourage people from buying it. Play Deceit instead, it's more fun and interesting and it's free."

26388,"I kill you. You kill me. Hopefully none of us have to endure 12 year olds smack talking.

This game brings the in-person feel of Mafia & Werewolf to the digital tabletop. It is most similar in that regard to Town of Salem but its energies & efforts manifest into a much greater design.

I would recommend you play this if you haven't yet. It is best with friends, though still good with strangers. You will hear a lot of smack talk from children if you have an open lobby.

Discount or not. Get this game."

Gonna split up, spread out 'cause we all got tasks to do

Heard a sound, turned around, looking up, looking down
Then I find a dead body
Gotta blow the horn, emergency discussion, who should we believe?
Can't decide, so, now we leave, not sure what I'm about to see
Will it be a dead body? Still have a task I must complete
Who's the impostеr?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can wе trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
I'm a ghost, I'm my biggest fear, got killed by the imposter
I was playing in the game, but now I'm just a watcher
I'm paying attention using my 360 vision
If it gets quiet, I listen
Make sure there's nothing I'm missing
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
It wasn't me (or me)
It definitely wasn't me
No one can be trusted because someone is lying
We still have tasks to do, so, let's split up so we can win
Everyone is sus so let this last round begin
There's an imposter among us
Trying to take something from us
We're still over here working
While she's just ghosting above us
Someone's under suspicion
Sabotaging our mission
Doing my task in the kitchen
Until I stop, look, and listen
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
Who's the imposter?
Looking sus, who can we trust?
I'm the I-M-P-O-S-T-E-R, that's me
While everyone's doing tasks, I'm going through vents on a killing spree
Yeah, I'm sus in Among Us
We can discuss whoever took your life
But if you think you're running this game, oh-yeah
That's me holding this knife
I'm the imposter
Looking sus, who can we trust?
I'm the imposter
Looking sus, who can we trust?
I'm the imposter
Looking sus, who can we trust?
I'm the imposter

26419,amongus very sus wow!!!!!!!
26420,"Among Us is a murder mystery game that can take place either in a spaceship named ""The Skeld,"" the headquarters of the company MIRA, a research base on the planet Polus, or an Airship. Among the players, one to three will be randomly chosen as Impostors, who need to blend in and kill the Crewmates. The Crewmates' goal is to complete tasks in the form of mini-games, such as fixing wiring, emptying garbage, or swiping an ID card, all the while having the goal of finding out who The Impostors are and voting them out. Impostors can Sabotage the map, which results in either a problem that will cause the Crew an inconvenience until fixed (e.g., turning off the lights, which affect the vision of the Crew, and messing up the Communications, which disables several useful features for the Crew and at the same time); or even a severe problem which gives the Crew an important task that must be completed under a time limit (such as depletion of the oxygen aboard the ship or meltdown of the reactor inside). The Impostors' goal is to kill off enough Crewmates for an equal amount of Impostors and Crewmates left, which results in a win for The Impostors as they theoretically could not be voted out. They are able to do this using the aforementioned sabotaging mechanic, though their main strategy is to directly murder each and every member one by one."
26421,great
26422,amaongus good? yes is
26423,"I mean I guess its not that fun unless you have friends but if you do I would really recommend playing this with all of them, one time me and my friend held a lobby open for 22 hours just so our friend would come back with us in the same lobby, but it got really boring after about 8 hours"

26462,"sus. Dieses Wort höre ich ständig seitdem Release von abongusa. Sus. Manchmal höre ich sus in meinen träumen. Jedes geräusch, was ich höre, gibt den Ton eines sus. Sus ist das phonetische Fundamnent unserer Spezies. Manche vermuten, dass der urknall den Ton sus gemacht hat. Sus ist die Quelle allen Lebens und alle Bösem.Was heißt sus? Sus ist die Kurzform von SUS(picious) oder die Firma Sauber Und Sicher. Auf deutsch heißt das verdächtig. Ich finde among us ist ein ""verdächtig(versteht ihr wegen sus. Weil sus heißt verdächtig(Easteregg)))"" gutes Spiel. Ich würde nur noch among us spielen, aber ich hab keine Freunde außer meinem imagenärem Freund names sus(versteht ihr (wegen among us)))(easteregg)(sus bedeutet verdächtig). Meine Eltern sagen ich mache keine Tasks mehr seitdem ich among us spiele aber ich hab gesehen wie mein vater geventet ist, aber er ist nicht zurückgekommen(ziemlich sus(Easteregg)). An eurer stelle würde ich among us spielen. Ein geiles among us spin off wäre S.u.s affenalarm. Ich wünsche mir noch ein eins ver(sus(Easteregg)) eins spielmode. Oh mein Gott. Das wäre einfach je""sus"". wir sollten die Macher von among us ""sus""spendieren. Rhe""sus(easteregg)"".

also dann, meine sussy bakas wir sehen uns in der nächsten Review!!! Euer Dudelsushater. Nicht zu verwechseln mit dem dudelsaucehater(easteregg(nicht zu verwechselkn mit der szechuan sauce aus rick und morty) In rick und morty verawndelt sich ein Wissenschaftler namens Richard in eine Seegurke. Das ist ziemlich lustig, da er eine Gurke ist. Gurken enthalten fast alle Vitamine die man täglich braucht. Auch vitamine, wie b6 oder auch b4, manche vermuten sogar dass das seltene b1 dabei ist, jedoch halte cih das für eine Verschwörungstheorie. Die Wissenschaft arbeitet dran(Richard helf uns bitte): du bist mein MEntor aber auch mein Vorbild, Ich wünsche auch, dass ich meinen Enkel mit auf meinen ""reisen"" mitnehmen kann, wenn ihr wisst was ich meine. Ich will auch reisen wie richard. Zudem will ich mal eine Gurke werden. Dies würde mir die Möglichkeit geben hauptsächlich aus Vitaminen wie b6 oder auch b8, manche vermuten sogar b1, zu enthalten. Das wäre eindeutig lustig!!!.ich persönlich glaube nicht an b1, da ich nicht boneheaded bin. Versteht ihr, da b1 auf englisch b one heißt und dies heißt zuusammen bone. hahahah das war lustig, aber nicht so lustig wie Gurke Richard. Erinnert ihr euch noch. Darüber hatten wir vorhin geredet.

Zum abschluss finde ich, dass ein Problem unserer jetzigen Generation ist, dass sie nie was zu Ende


P.S ich brauche Richard in seiner Gurkenform in among us  als skin.

26535,"The game is alright for a one off, you know. Its pretty good."
26536,"theres nothing like being colorblind and playing the ''red'' game with your friends! letting them confuse you even more! its even more fun when you're the imposter who killed a red and dont know what red.. anyways side track,,

its a great game, its really fun and i hope they keep developing it, adding game modes, more roles, more maps etc. its fun for the whole community and its fun just to play casually with friends before you kill them too much and make them cry #totallynotmeinthegames"
26537,"This game is really fun with friends, I recommend to all"

26539,"Simple game well built, to play online the idea is to discover who the impostor is whyle performing tasks (mini games) you will need to chat with other players during the game. Simple and addictive"

26546,"They've taken away all of the things that you need in order to play the game- free typing, ex,"
26547,"The game itself is absolutely fantastic, but it has one major flaw wich is the people that play it. in public lobbies, people will promptly leave after realizing they dont get the imposter role, they will go AFK all of a sudden, and little kids cant take that the fundamentals of this game is to deceive, and will get mad at you for lying.

If you have a group of friends however, this is an amazing game."
26548,Lost my DLC in the update and now I can't purchase anything from the store because the whole thing freezes on the 'making purchase' popup. How about some help here???

The answer is clear."
26566,good
26567,It's fun to play a few rounds here and there when you are bored. Once they added the experience system I found myself playing much more often. It feels more rewarding to finish a game now that they have a progression system where you earn currency for completing rounds that you can buy cosmetics with. If you find yourself playing a fair amount of among us then it's worth it to fork out the few dollars for this version
26568,Nice game. But it can be improved more and more. Personally I have a lot of ideas for this game.

26583,I would say that this game is immaculate. The game play is exquisite and I have an incredibly jolly amazing time playing Among us. Plus Dreamy Weemy and Goggy Woggy have played it before. My two year old sister likes my among us pop it. She even had a mental breakdown when i wanted it back. I would say that the among us products are also immaculate. (this review is a complete joke please do not take this seriously but i would actually recommend this game because i enjoy it a lot. you can tell because i have 56 hours on this game). My ex homophobic and racist boyfriend also payed 7 dollars for this game or something like that. I hate my ex boyfriend. He is a ginger.

That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a fridge that looked like among us, I'd see an animated bag of chips that looked like among us, I'd see a hat that looked like among us. And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than ""sus."" I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is ""red sus"" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word ""among"" is ruined. The phrase ""among us"" is ruined.

This game is pure entertainment. I love this game. It is obviously the BEST murder mystery games ever (and the only one I've played pretty much), and the most fun is when you are the Imposter. You get to lie, kill, trick, and laugh at your friends (and other randoms) WITHOUT GETTING IN TROUBLE!!! Being a Crewmate is also fun- mostly when you get to say ""I told you so."" to your friends when you're right, and laugh at your friends when you're THE ONLY ONE right.

I probably HAVE to rate this game, so i'm gonna say

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your game gave me cancer anyway."

Keep these in mind
> Majority of players want to do memes. ""It's always Red"". Or will just say a color just because.
> Watch out for Discord ""Friend Groups"". They have public lobbies but will accuse anyone who isn't in their group."

26771,"The Bombing of Tokyo (東京大空襲, Tōkyōdaikūshū) was a series of firebombing air raids by the United States Army Air Forces during the Pacific campaigns of World War II. Operation Meetinghouse, which was conducted on the night of 9–10 March 1945, is the single most destructive bombing raid in human history.[1] Of central Tokyo 16 square miles (41 km2; 10,000 acres) were destroyed, leaving an estimated 100,000 civilians dead and over one million homeless. The US first mounted a seaborne, small-scale air raid on Tokyo (the ""Doolittle Raid"") in April 1942. Strategic bombing and urban area bombing began in 1944 after the long-range B-29 Superfortress bomber entered service, first deployed from China and thereafter the Mariana Islands. B-29 raids from those islands began on 17 November 1944, and lasted until 15 August 1945, the day of Japanese surrender. Over 50% of Tokyo's industry was spread out among residential and commercial neighborhoods; firebombing cut the whole city's output in half. Some modern post-war analysts have called the raid a war crime due to the targeting of civilian infrastructure and the ensuing mass loss of civilian life. The key development for the bombing of Japan was the B-29 Superfortress strategic bomber, which had an operational range of 3,250 nautical miles (3,740 mi; 6,020 km) and was capable of attacking at high altitude above 30,000 feet (9,100 m), where enemy defenses were very weak. Almost 90% of the bombs dropped on the home islands of Japan were delivered by this type of bomber. Once Allied ground forces had captured islands sufficiently close to Japan, airfields were built on those islands (particularly Saipan and Tinian) and B-29s could reach Japan for bombing missions. The initial raids were carried out by the Twentieth Air Force operating out of mainland China in Operation Matterhorn under XX Bomber Command, but these could not reach Tokyo. Operations from the Northern Mariana Islands commenced in November 1944 after the XXI Bomber Command was activated there.The high-altitude bombing attacks using general-purpose bombs were observed to be ineffective by USAAF leaders due to high winds—later discovered to be the jet stream—which carried the bombs off target. Between May and September 1943, bombing trials were conducted on the Japanese Village set-piece target, located at the Dugway Proving Grounds. These trials demonstrated the effectiveness of incendiary bombs against wood-and-paper buildings, and resulted in Curtis LeMay's ordering the bombers to change tactics to utilize these munitions against Japan.
The first such raid was against Kobe on 4 February 1945. Tokyo was hit by incendiaries on 25 February 1945 when 174 B-29s flew a high altitude raid during daylight hours and destroyed around 643 acres (260 ha) (2.6 km2) of the snow-covered city, using 453.7 tons of mostly incendiaries with some fragmentation bombs. After this raid, LeMay ordered the B-29 bombers to attack again but at a relatively low altitude of 5,000 to 9,000 ft (1,500 to 2,700 m) and at night, because Japan's anti-aircraft artillery defenses were weakest in this altitude range, and the fighter defenses were ineffective at night. LeMay ordered all defensive guns but the tail gun removed from the B-29s so that the aircraft would be lighter and use less fuel.On the night of 9–10 March 1945,[16] 334 B-29s took off to raid with 279 of them dropping 1,665 tons of bombs on Tokyo. The bombs were mostly the 500-pound (230 kg) E-46 cluster bomb which released 38 napalm-carrying M-69 incendiary bomblets at an altitude of 2,000–2,500 ft (610–760 m). The M-69s punched through thin roofing material or landed on the ground; in either case they ignited 3–5 seconds later, throwing out a jet of flaming napalm globs. A lesser number of M-47 incendiaries were also dropped: the M-47 was a 100-pound (45 kg) jelled-gasoline and white phosphorus bomb which ignited upon impact. In the first two hours of the raid, 226 of the attacking aircraft unloaded their bombs to overwhelm the city's fire defenses. The first B-29s to arrive dropped bombs in a large X pattern centered in Tokyo's densely populated working class district near the docks in both Koto and Chūō city wards on the water; later aircraft simply aimed near this flaming X. The individual fires caused by the bombs joined to create a general conflagration, which would have been classified as a firestorm but for prevailing winds gusting at 17 to 28 mph (27 to 45 km/h). Approximately 15.8 square miles (4,090 ha) of the city were destroyed and some 100,000 people are estimated to have died. A grand total of 282 of the 339 B-29s launched for ""Meetinghouse"" made it to the target, 27 of which were lost due to being shot down by Japanese air defenses, mechanical failure, or being caught in updrafts caused by the fires."

So the other day at work my boss told us that he recently discovered the video game Among Us, and ever since, his behaviour has become rather concerning. He now refers to me and my coworkers as 'crewmates'. Last Wednesday, when he noticed my teenage colleague slacking off at his workstation, he yelled at him saying he was ""faking his tasks"" and is ""acting sus"". I confronted my boss telling him that his behaviour lately has been egregious and immature, and he proceeded to call me an idiot and yelled ""kicked!"" The next day I caught him dancing around in his office blasting ""among drip"" from his desktop at full volume. I entered his office to kindly ask him to turn off the music since it was distracting to me and my coworkers. He looked at me angrily, telling me he has called an ""emergency meeting"", instructing me to have a seat. I asked him what was the matter and he told me that I have been acting extremely ""sus"". He repeatedly yelled ""you're the impostor"", telling me to say goodbye to my job because I have been ""ejected"". I fucking lost my job and I don't know what to do."

26890,"Has it's ups and downs.
Love the music, art style, and gameplay. However, the overworld/dungeon areas are slow and laggy while everything else runs smoothly. NPCs will also glitch out during cutscenes and will either walk in circles or pace back and forth, causing the game to softlock as the dialogue of the cutscene will not initiate if the required NPCs arent present. This has happened 5-6 times within ~1-2 hours of playtime. I want to play the game, but it's kinda hard when half of the game runs slower than the rest and the cutscenes have a chance to softlock you and require you to repeat previous combat.

Would recommend when issues are dealt with"

26919,"Among Us is not a game. Now I know, I know, believe ME I KNOW.
This game is in your steam library, you're thinking. It's in mine too. How could it not be a game?
Among Us is... more than that. It transcends the medium that IS gaming. It goes beyond anything you think you know about the internet, visual media, entertainment, and personal involvement.

People often cite works such as Mario Party, Portal 2, Battleblock theater, etc. as friendship ruining games. Among Us is not simply a ""game"" in this facet. Among Us is a weapon; it was built to destroy any fragment of hope you have in your tiny little body and shred any ounce of confidence you had that your so-called 'friends' liked you. I can safely say anyone that continues to play Among Us in 2022, myself included, should be confined to a single massive padded room. There is no definite way to compartmentalize the impact that this has had on my daily life since the big Among Us bang over the start of the Covid internet era

Having put over a full days worth of time into Among Us I can say with one million percent confidence I would take it all back if I could. I have become a feral beast with a lust for calling out my friends and loved ones. At no point in my life would I have expected everything to turn to this. I can't even hold a job anymore because every time I see a normal vent cover at work I start gnawing at the hinges of it to check and see if any imposters or engineers are inside. I'm colorblind and yet seeing the color red automatically makes me foam at the mouth, the only word able to escape it ""sus"". I've seen so many sussy and dumpy emotes in my time that when I close my eyes the fucking amogus lips gif from discord is all I can see.

Please, someone take me away from this place.
If you can avoid it, please, I beg you, don't turn out like me. Mario Party is fine, Pico Park is fine, none of them have anywhere close to the same impact as this... please just stay. away. from Among Us.
There is only one other experience akin to this and it is known as 

Crab Game"

The only way that you can play this game is in a voice call. On top of this, a levels system has been introduced. This added a level of toxicity to the game.

26967,This game is literally only fun if you're messing around with at least 3 people.
26968,This game is a super fun like murder mystery game that i've followed for awhile. The new roles and cosmic cubes are also a new outstanding feature to the game giving it more fun and adventure. Letting people unlock more with beans instead of purchasing everything is a better and cool feature and still allows you to purchase things along side it. To me this game is really cools and meets my expectations for a fun freeing game.

27016,"Terrible experience almost every single game, rife with cheaters and toxic players. The first challenge is finding a game with decent settings (why would you add special classes to the game at all?), and when you find one that you like, after a few rounds in you start to notice that some of the players are voting without using chat at all, somehow all coming to a telepathic consensus as to who should get voted out of the airlock. Sometimes these players will watch as the imposter kills in front of them, and then not say anything at all in the chat.... Sometimes a dead character will say something in chat that a live one will respond to. 

Reporting these players does nothing, and you have a better chance of winning the lottery than you do of finding a completely legit game. When you confront them, you are kicked from the game and replaced with someone else who gets to have the next 40 minutes of their life wasted before they realize what's going on.

It's a good concept for a game, but lacking in the meaningful moderation and enforcement that it requires to be playable."

They took forever to bring out the new map and kept on stretching the release date. 

Which causes the players to get bored and expect a lot. Overall I don't recommend unless you're at a young age and playing with a decent amount of friends."

27121,"This game saved my life.

I am 25.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

27168,"If we're talking about the game itself, it's a good game. Good gameplay, a so-so community, and good locations. But if we're talking about what this game has done to the internet, I fucking hate this game with every fiber of my being. I'm so sick of seeing the words ""Among Us"" every five seconds when I'm browsing the internet. I'm so sick of this game. Why can't it just die already??

Other than that, decent game, terrible and annoying as shit legacy"

27255,"First time playing since the big update. I'm imposter on the first round in a six person game with some close friends. It's been [i] quite awhile [/i] since I've played, and I guess they added a bunch of cool shit. Like new roles and menu screens and achievements. Cool, but it's still Among Us. I've played this game before; I know how it goes. So we're on Polus, I tag along with one of the better players amongst my pals, and we head over to the specimen room. Before going in for the kill I apologize to my dear friend, as I did feel a little guilty making them the first to die of the night. But this was a calculated decision. If I could get them out of the way, [b] maybe [/b] I could win. I run away from the scene, my heart [i] literally [/i] pounding. I'm quickly and quietly trying to come up with a good alibi, but it's all in vain. It turns out that rest of them weren't far behind and the body is reported. Now we're in discussion, and I'm trying (failing) to come up with an excuse when in the last few seconds, one of my friends goes ""Oh I know for sure it's eeby deeby cooper, I saw the steam notification that you got the achievement for your first kill.""

funniest fucking thing ever 10/10 perfect game"
27256,"STOP POSTING ABOUT AMONG US. I'M TIRED OF SEEING IT! My friends on Tiktok send me memes, on Discord it's fucking memes; I was in a server, right, and ALL of the channels are just Among Us stuff. I-I showed my Champion underwear to my girlfriend and the logo-I flipped it and I said, ""Hey babe, when the underwear sus HAHA! DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING-DING-DING!"" I looked at a trashcan and said, ""THAT'S A BIT SUSSY!"" I looked at my penis, I think of the astronauts helmet, and I go ""PENIS, MORE LIKE PEEN-SUS!"" AHHHHHHHH-
But for real, this game is great with the new roles it has added and the new cosmetics system giving me reason to now play alone instead of just with my friends which is also an absolutely wonderful experience. A great game to play with a big group of friends or to even play online alone or with a buddy. 10/10"

95% of this game is just plain stupid. I played this game for 3 days (22 hours worth), and I'm never going to play it again. There's a reason why I stayed away from the boom this game received in 2020.

TL;DR: play with friends, not in public lobbies."

27294,"Will you be an innocent crew member religiously doing your tasks potentially falling victim to the Killer or will you be the impostor that fakes his tasks and secretly betrays his fellow comrads by stabbing them in the back? Literally!

Go on a trip through space, working hand in hand with your fellow crew memebers to keep the ship functioning. Watch out, there's an impostor!  
This mission might cost you your life... 


The objectives of the roles:

Crew member: 

- Do your tasks
- Repair sabotaged gear
- Watch your back
- Report dead bodies
- Pay attention to clues that can lead to the impostor and report them

Impostor: 

- Fake tasks
- Use vents to move around faster or hide
- Gain trust of the crew
- Sabotage to distract crew
- Lie 
- Manipulate the crew
- Secretly kill all crew memebers 


The max number of players that can be set is 15.
There can be several imposters and also several of the new roles.
The new roles are set by number and percentage of chance they will be assigned, based on the settings of the room.


Voting: 

All crew members get a set amount of time, depending on the settings of the room to discuss what clues they have or who they suspect to be the impostor. After, they get a set amount of time to vote who they think the impostor is. This can be set to openly showing who voted for who or can be set to be annonymous, depending on the room settings. Then the votes are counted/shown and the person with the most votes is ejected from the ship, killing them. If the votes are even, nothing happens. If you're not sure because there aren't enough clues there's also a skip option. Again, depending on the room settings it will then show if the ejected member was an imposter or not.


Emergency meeting:

Both crew members and imposters can call an emergency meeting to report their findings/proof. The impostor does this solely to confuse crew members and lead suspiscion away from him. There is a set amount of times such a meeting can be called, which differs from game to game, based on the settings of the room creator. 


Ghost:

After you die, you become a ghost. You can float around the map and watch the rest of the events unfold. As a ghost you have one task only - to continue doing your tasks, as the objective of crew members is to do all their tasks to win or to find out who the impostor/s is/are and eject them. You continuing your tasks as a ghost will help your living crew memebers to win. You cannot help fix sabotages as a ghost though.



New roles have been added!


Scientist (Crew with ability):

Scientists are like normal crew memebers and thus their objective is the same with the difference that they have a special ability to check people's vitals anywhere they are. This shows them if a crew memeber was killed. The abilty has a cooldown.


Engineer (Crew with ability):

Engineers are like normal crew memebers too and thus have the same objective. Engineers have the ability to use vents to move around and as such can also hide in them to spy on the impostor. The ability has a cooldown.


Guardian Angel (Crew with ability):

Guardian angels are like normal crew memebers as well and thus have the same objective. Their ability is to protect their fellow crew members from harm, although they can only do so when they themselves have fallen victim to the imposter and died. When a crew member is protected by them and the imposter strikes, it will be warded off once, avoiding the crew member's death. The ability has a cooldown.


Shapeshifter (Only playable as imposter):

Only impostors can have the role of the shapeshifter. Shapeshifters can change their appearance to look like any of the other crew members for a certain period of time. This helps with confusing the crew memebers, to make them believe someone else comitted your crime. Shapeshifting takes a few seconds and thus can be viewed by any crew memeber walking by, so be careful to only use it when nobody is around to see you shifting. You'll also leave traces of tentacles on the spot you shifted on, leaving hints for the crew members. Once the countdown is over you transform back to your own appearance. Again, be careful to not be seen when that happens as it will give away your idenitiy.

27421,"My life changing journey of becoming vegan.
After the first week of being vegan I woke up ripped. My toes had so much muscle mass they looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger. My biceps were so heavy I wouldn’t be able to lift them if I wasn’t vegan. My neck had become a pyramid of muscle and vein and I was so strong I didn’t need to take my car to work, I just walked there and the city moved underneath me somehow. After the second week I laid an egg and out popped a smaller version of me. I took him with me everywhere and together we laughed at meat eaters and bashed the skulls of school children eating Lunchables. Finally on the third week I transformed into an ascended being, I shredded my human form and became a beautiful celestial piece of broccoli. Now I move across the universe blessing worlds with my wisdom of all things. I am officially a vegan.

27589,"I truly believe the game among us is a modern day masterpiece. On the surface level it appears like a simple party game to play with friends & family, full of bright colours to compliment this audience. However this ""fun"" & ""warm hearted"" aesthetic is simply to hide how truly dark this game is. Underneath this surface level is a game full of lies, murder, betrayal & deceit, I personally believe the developers of this subversive masterpiece did this fully on purpose. The colourful & happy look hiding a dark under belly represents how us the players play among us, we put on a mask of kindness & trust to pull the carpet when it suits us best. Additionally I believe among us exposes a lot about the human condition, we constantly do these meaningless tasks until we make it to the end or get back stabbed by others. We ruin the lives of those who we considered friends just for our own personal game, the imposter isn't just a role but is what we are as people. Another topic among us tackles with absolute grace is racism, us as players have associated certain colours as ""sus"" such as red. Even if red is innocent they will be unfairly accused, this is to show how the system is broken & treats those of certain ethnicities lesser & with harsher punishment. Lastly among us tackles the idea of complete hopelessness, the players are ejected to float about in space among the stars left to simply die. This is to represent how we are nothing but a speck in the way of others, completely powerless to fight back. This is represented by the crewmate being among hundreds of other tiny dots to represent how we're not special & just specks. I truly believe among us is a masterpiece that doesn't get enough recognition for how it exposes the sins of humans & the idea of despair, I beg all of you to think of this comment next time you chalk up among us as a simple ""joke game"". I sincerely thank you all for reading my thoughts on this work of art."

I cant even reset my age or anything, and it wants me to ""email my guardian"" so it can verify my parents allowed me to play fucking among us. 

AND to verify, you have to give this sketchy ass site your credit card info! FUCK no!

This is fucking bullshit.

edit: They aren't letting me refund it because i've played four hours, and the customer service was nice enough to reassure me, that my credit card info would end up at the third party, not them, and totally ignored my refund request. Fucking great."

27632,"You already know if you're going to pick this game up or not. What I will say is that random lobbies are not fun at all (or insanely hilarious, depending on your take) and this is absolutely a party game for friends. Thankfully, unlike other Werewolf-style games, Among Us is perfectly priced to invite your friends. I highly recommend the PC version over the others since you have keyboard access as opposed to the quick chat options. I've had loads of fun with Among Us, and I'm sure it will keep chugging along for quite some time."

27685,"All the jokes and memes about this game aside I have to be completely honest here... Among Us was a fun game, I started playing it on mobile around the peak of it's popularity and eventually got it on PC to play with a couple friends... But now, it really isn't the game it used to be - and I'm not saying that because of the new roles or microtransactions - but because of the game's playerbase...

I've spent upwards of 5 minutes trying to find an actual match, but I'm either met with a lobby people doing some sort of FNaF roleplay, people using Among Us as a chatroom, or - worst of all, and most importantly - people who use Among Us to ERP... (Who are likely child predators, might I add...)

And while I do understand that there is just a small team behind this game, I hardly see that as an excuse to NOT have some sort of report button for lobbies and/or players... It needs some serious moderation behind it to stop that sort of behavior - especially in a game that so many small children play...

FNaF roleplayers and chat room substitutes I can live with, but not those people...

In short, no, in it's current state I cannot recommend Among Us to anyone... If Innersloth listens to their playerbase and actually does something to help combat those kinds of people, then I may very well update this review and recommend it... But that's a pretty big if..."
27686,This game cured me of my mortality.
27687,I enjoy the community most of all the people that you get to meet are mostly fun and exciting. Great game and community.

27723,"Among Us hit it big in late 2020 and has experienced a slow decline throughout the year of 2021. The game has become much more in-depth with the addition of cosmicubes and an array of cosmetic items, but the core gameplay has stayed the same. It can become a more in-depth game when imposter and crewmate roles are enabled, giving new abilities such as using vents as a crewmate and mophing into another player as an imposter. This is a high recommend for a game that's only $5, but be aware of the microtransactions, they're not worth it at all in my opinion."

tl;dr too many complicated updates, very hard to learn

27972,YES
27973,Among Us is the perfect game to release your anger on and feel the great urge of murder... wait-
27974,"It is a good game that works well with how it is meant to. The game is pretty balanced with how each role works and there aren't many times where things happen that aren't your fault unless there is a hacker or lag. The only issue I have is the chances of getting a role. Sometime people get impostor 4 times in a row, but others play for an hour and only get crew mate. Maybe increase the chance of getting impostor every time you aren't the impostor, and opposite when you get it? That might make the game more fun. Other than that, I have no complaints"

27996,"One of the best games that I've ever played.

Firstly, I would like to thank Innersloth and the other teams that have helped make Among Us and port it onto consoles (e.g. Xbox one). It is amazing how many ways they have made the game playable- even on an iPhone 4s!

To me, Among Us is such a great game because of it's sense of progression with impostor and crewmate skill progression, but it also has a lot of freedom with how quickly or slowly you would like to progress, to take time to do your tasks with the many tasks the game has to offer; although you may not like some of them much (e.g. difficult wires task), the fact that there is so much that the game has to offer is astounding, with such a diverse set of sus opportunities.

Another reason to love this game is that there are many different options; be it accessories or your character itself, there is a wide array of choices, with outfit pieces like funny eggs or silly brown colour, or options as far as difficulty, both with choosing number of impostors and kill cooldown, ranging from casual to extremely difficult. Even further, you are allowed a choice between different maps, Polus, Skeld Etc. It creates a real feeling of each adventure being unique and not overlapping.

The fact that the game has been going strong for 3 years is a testament to it's greatness; 3 years of FREE updates which include (but are not limited to); new maps, new colours/accessories, awesome battlepass, new roles and new music. This is extremely impressive on it's own, however an enormous modding community will allow the game to remain popular for far longer. I cannot commend the developers making Among Us VR. so exciting!

It is a shame that the game's updates will most likely cease. It is still so fantastic and impressive how Among Us has built a world which has pleased millions and has been played many millions of times through. Getting 100% completion in Among Us is near impossible with such achievements as taskmaster, making you complete 500 whole tasks CRAZY XD, which would be at least, I'd say 1000 hours of playtime. yet that isn't even scratching the surface of getting every cosmetic in the game, which would take many more hours to complete legitimately. These features as well as the infinite replayability are what have kept me coming back for more for so many years.

Thank you so much for this 3-year long roller coaster of a game.

Thank you, Kalastical for buying this for me."

28005,"Recently I visited a bargain bin store, and I couldn't keep track of how many full-on outfits of Among Us merch I could've purchased for 10 bucks. That's the current state of the game, but unlike some AAA releases that lost significance with time, I feel like this flash-in-the-pan didn't deserve its sudden abandonment.

I was seriously impressed with the sudden influx of fame this incredibly small indie game received two years after it released. I haven't played it since some major update(s) however... and apparently 95% of the world hasn't either. Yeah, it looks like this game fizzled out pretty quickly, I'm assuming because the team of this is so small that it takes far longer to add new content compared to more massive multiplayer games...

So yeah writing a review of it NOW is weird, since it recently got an update with achievements, new roles, etc. and I haven't experience ANY of it yet... But I wanted to at least put my two cents in that at its peak this was a fun social game to play with friends, and the anxiety and manipulation of trying to find out who the killer is was quite exhilarating. The tasks that ""humans"" have to do are pretty much padding for the ACTUAL fun of piecing together who's who, where you last saw them, what weirdo shit they were doing that made you nervous, etc. etc. It was the first time I played a game so dependent on the social skills of the sociopaths you play with, so with the right people it was quite enjoyable...

Unfortunately it got old quick, and much of the gameplay was either waiting for randoms to join in or just flat-out toxic players spoiling the fun for everyone else. Even so, one day I'll revisit this game and see what the devs introduce to try and keep things fresh. I still applaud this for being such an interesting tale of success for Innersloth, even if its popularity tanked as the public moved on to other multiplayer shit-fests.

And yes, I wrote this entirely in my Among Us garb.

28043,"Among Us is a fun multiplayer game involving trust and betrayal. You do tasks around different maps (Space Station, Airship,) and it has lots of funny references and an amazing art style. Recently, among us was trending everywhere, and now that has ended, the game is still amazing and with their regular updates I don't see why everybody still isn't playing this. Good game, recommended by me."

I don’t normally vent because normally my friends are annoyed at it, but this game provided me an outlet like no other. I also came  across great people! Such as the My Hero Academia Role Playing community! They were nice enough to vote me out every round of Among Us so I could sit back and enjoy the lore! Another community I would like to shout out is the Among Us pro-scene. The pros don’t get the attention they deserve! We’ll guys, I’d rank this game up there with the likes of Counter-Strike in terms of difficulty and competitiveness. Hope you all found this helpful!

If only it looked like this when it was big, maybe it would have lasted longer. 4.5/5 stars only because they put in rose pink as a color option."

My friend asked me once, ""Do you want to play a game called Among Us? It's like Gmod Murder."" I said about five times, ""No. I do not want Among Us"" Five days later, along with me repeatedly saying, ""Don't buy me Among Us"" ""I don't want Among Us"" He bought it for me anyway. Then after like 2 months i said I was done with Among Us, in which he then started to get angry at me, saying I wasted his money. Idiot."

I only hate it when I dont get the IMPOSTA from AMOUNGS US insiert sad emoji. It is very simular to the IMPOSTERS game mode in FORTNITE, and I think they stole alot of this game from FORNITE, but overall I rate it a DRINKY out of 4 BOBUCKS <3."

28208,"sussy amog us chacrecter

28209,"The game was great until they fucked it up with their shitty ass update that made EVERYTHING WORTHLESS!!! I haven't been able to play in days, sometimes I get banned for ""hacking"" when no hacking occurred, the servers disconnect me and I get punished with a timeout for several hours due to something I had no control over. Honestly they should be ashamed of themselves. They took an amazing fun game I could play with my friends, to something that causes me so much stress I no longer find joy in it. Seriously... their half-assed attempt (I wouldn't even say it was that much effort to be honest) ruined the game."
28210,"hi
"
28211,"A surprisingly good game with plenty of new updates to make it a load of fun. Among Us used to just be a meme to me until I started to really grind (grind sounds weird in Among Us) the cosmicubes. I would 100% recommend this for playing it with a group of friends. 

Tip: Play Hide and Seek on Airship with good friends, 1 imposter with shapeshift, low kill cool down, normal speed, lowest eyesight, and all the hiders using engineer and normal vision and speed. No emergency meetings, reporting, or sabotages on anything but lights. Enjoy!"

28251,I don't really like this game. It just got murdered by memes and the community.... AMOG-
28252,/
28253,"I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

That's all, thank you."
28254,It's good.
28255,fun with friends or not... they start sussing you in reallife after taking it too far ingame

If I could, I would make Among Us the #1 Best Everything. I bought Among Us on sale for 3.74$, but if I were able to spend the full 5 dollars, I most definitely would."

28316,"The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm relianc"

28397,"Overall, this is actually a rather solid and well made social deduction game. In my opinion, playing survivor and imposter are equally balanced, with both sides having fair/equal tools to be able to best one another. Playing with friends/one party is really where the game shines, as by seeing how others react/behave you can play a game akin to cat and mouse that is very fun and rewarding. 

The game also has a number of features that can be tweaked to your liking so that you can play how you want. Smaller lobbies, different game modes (e.g hide and seek) all allow for the game to be new and fun, even though it's still the same fundamentally.

Naturally, with a game like this the biggest problem is the community. People that don't want to play properly/are incapable of thought and will just meme relentlessly. Using well defined tactics such as using visual queues for an extended period of time or sticking with another player that you know is safe, whilst you yourself are safe and have proven it, can often lead to a swift eviction. Playing with randoms at times is simply an exercise in futility as quiet a large amount of them are not interested in having an actually good game. But that being said, the same goes for any multiplayer game so it is best to exhibit caution. 

Overall, a solid game that I could definitely recommend."

28480,"This game used to be really good when it first blew up. I hadn't played it for a while then came back recently to see all the new changes. Was disheartened to see that now all the lobbies were filled with abuse and some people telling each other to go die. In a game like this, to have no means to report abuse is really a huge oversight and something the devs need to figure out. The new customization options might be cool and all, but given that mostly kids play this game, the fact that anyone can be abusive and get away with it is really not on."

28489,"The game is good at its core. It's able to hold my attention and keep me playing for hours. No interaction is the same twice. People have branched off the main game and created their own little sub game  called hide and seek. I would like to see more outfits for us female players, but this is just cosmetic and doesn't affect the overall game play. The amount of trolls in this game can sometimes make it difficult to find a good group to play with, but if you are playing with a group of friends, this eliminates that issue."

28586,"sussy
"
28587,"Honestly, I really, truly wanted to like this game. It had a great concept of a casual environment with little commitment. However, there are a lot of issues that just cannot be solved to the point where I cannot recommend this to others.

Forget about the fact that the scientist role is absolutely useless for the moment. We've got players who are making political usernames, jumping into games and then just blatantly spewing political right-wing/left-wing bullshit that I didn't want to deal with. If that wasn't bad enough, players are constantly herd voting, where if one person randomly suspects another person of being an impostor without evidence, everyone else will join in on that vote, not even caring about whether or not the evidence is there. I've tried many, MANY times to address this issue; however, others just refuse to listen. No amount of anti-troll systems will make it possible to minimize, much less outright eliminate, herd voting.

If that wasn't bad enough, try dealing with players who join games, only to leave 2-3 seconds after the game starts. What a way to make the match boring, folks.

But the worst of all is the fact that it's hard to host lobbies unless you're livestreaming on Twitch or playing with a large group of friends. Like, who would want to join a lobby consisting of only 2-4 players? Nobody! Everyone just wants to hop on games that have at least 8-10 players! This makes hosting new games for regular players just utterly impossible.

Will I continue to play this game? Maybe, maybe not. Would I recommend this game to others? No, unless you're absolutely positively sure that you'll be able to live with political trolls and herd voting. If you're looking for a game where you can actually vent stress and have a fun experience, well, you better keep looking, 'cause this game is not it."

28593,"This game is very complex and in-depth, but in a good way. The new updates adding the roles of shapeshifter, scientist, and engineer made the playing field much more interesting. The heavy customization of settings in matches and your character I personally enjoy, but the addition of premium (payed) currency I was a little annoyed at. Nevertheless, I rate this game overall 5 out of 6 soggy pancakes."

28611,cool
28612,great fun with freinds
28613,"If you dont have friends to play this game, absolutely dont buy it. You will spend more time joining to servers that will disconnect you due to high ping or game's fault, rather than playing!"
28614,Most fun I've ever had... Until the roles update.
28615,Too many trolls
28616,"This online game is one of the best, the game is aboute an spaceship (or a building, planet or an airship depending of the map) and there are some alien like creture that has taken that has taken the shape of one of youre crewmembers and their mission is to kill everybody inside.

Gameplay:
You take the role of either one of the crewmembers or the impostor, if you are a crewmate, you need to repair the place and deduce who is the impostor, if you are the impostore you must kill all of the crewmates and avoid being detected

Resume:
For me is a great game and its fun to play with friends I give it a 9."
28617,You play this game I'm putting you on my DNI list.
28618,'If hes not the impostor then vote me next'
28619,It was a fun game
28620,Playing this game was a truly life changing experience. Kinda sus tho
28621,good
28622,"this game really changed my life. It has brought me and my friends so many good memories. But now it has gone to shit. This game has really become one of the worst games to ever exist and has one of the biggest downfalls of gaming history. For example it literally died within 2 months, like what the hell could of gone wrong."

28649,Great game to play with friends can get boring after learning the meta game
28650,Really fun if with members of family or friends. Wide range of customisation and low amount of bugs. Graphics are low and has small amounts of hackers. Great concept. Low price and not pay to win.
28651,dogshit

28653,good game but i bought the bedcrab bundle befor the update over a year ago and i come back on for a big game with freinds to see my pets gone and having to buy theme agian. can i just have them back
28654,wow its among us
28655,"<3
"
28656,"If someone made this into a parody game i would totally be down to play. Crewmates are females, imposters are males, and instead of going on a murder spree, the imposters have to fuck as many of the crew as possible. Might have to have a single player mode, idk how you'd do that tho. Or you could focus on a single player game and have multiplayer secondary for longer sex scenes. Or, even better, you could incapacitate a target and drag them into a vent or hole to delay your time in multiplayer but hide the body, which could trigger a sex loop for as long as you're hiding. You could come back to certain ones to continue the loop. Could also have tasks be pleasure machines."

The games player base is very young, hence the recycling of boring ""memes"", it makes the core mechanic of discussing and providing evidence during meetings pointless, and well if the main objective is pointless, then you don't actually have a game to play."

Let's talk about the graphics. They are stunning, it's an eye candy and I certainly am glad to put my gaming rig to work with this beast. The graphics are important, remember that!

The story is surprising, but right. The writers outdid themselves here - so there is this crewmate, who is an [b] Imposter [/b] and though he is too sus, to my tastes, I still loved it!

The OST is fantastic, every time I play it, I get goosebumps and flashbacks to my childhood when my dad was beating me with the belt.

And what about the cultural impact, you might ask? Well, governments have agreed to withdraw nuclear arms race just to be able to play some Among Us, kids in school no longer study Fortnite skins, and they have Among Us to thank for that. 

I love Among Us, I play Among Us, I breathe Among Us because I want to [u] be [/u] Among us. Your boyfriend, your dead grandmother, and even your local game journalist can enjoy this piece of history and masterpiece. 5/5"

28795,It's overrated but not a bad game at all.
28796,"It is a game that is now despised by the average teen because it was popular. but in reality once you get past all the memes, It is still a great and fun game. The community around Innersloth is amazing and full of support, and makes amazing promos for their games. Its one that I am proud to no longer rip, and actually pay for to contribute to the amazing devs. I mean it may just be ""that game"" but when you pick it up again in a year, or a few months you are bound to have a good laugh."

28816,"The game can be fun when playing with a group of friends whether we get the roles of being a crewmate or an impostor. Not to mention, the developer of this game had added new extra features (extra roles) that can cater to both crewmates and impostors alike such as Shapeshifter, Engineer, Guardian Angel, Scientist, and others. I wouldn't be surprised that the origin of the word ""sus"" comes from this reference of Among Us.

28841,"After more than 3 years from its premiere, the game is bugged. Even though it is not being developed. Now they have added more payments and new paid skins while not reducing bugs.

It's just a joke that after all this time, while the modding community has created a dozen (or even several dozen) different roles, the creators release an update in which they release 3 roles, one of which is bugged and the other so buggy that it cannot be used.

This is just shit. The developers spit in the face of the people who play this game. Shame."

28894,"This game has seemed to always be popular - and for good reason. It's simple and a lot of friends can join the same server. A lot of games limit it to 4 people, while this goes up way higher (6-8 I believe?). Always updating and adding new things. It's like Monopoly or Uno, friendships die but there is plenty of laughter along the way."
28895,Haven't been able to join a game since the new update (keep getting error messages). Reinstalled multiple times and nothing. If you want a social deduction game that you can't play with anyone else this is the perfect game...

28901,"This game, with such immaculate social deduction skills required to play effectively, has been a magnificent method of killing time for everyone who has or had to stay at home. The simplistic characters are easily distinguished from one other with their wide assortment of colors, as well as access to free and paid cosmetics alike. If you are interested in socializing over the internet to deduct which among your group is an impostor while you either complete various tasks or kill all your beloved friends, then this is just the game for you."
28902,"Love the update, but plz fix compatibility for EpicColors by Devs-Us. The Custom colors don't appear and are unusable now. all it does still is add a 5th column to the color menu ): I'm on latest version of Among Us and EpicColors. It only shows the non-modded colors ):"

There are different maps, making it more fun! You can be crewmate, impostor, shapeshifter, scientist, engineer, or guardian angel! You can have more than just a color and hat on mobile, you can have as much accessories on mobile as you do on PC. There are also no advertisements. Amazing game, would recommend."

28929,it wont let me type with the keybord no matter wut i did i and i rest my account for nothing
28930,"Who imagined that a bunch of beans with an eye in the middle of their face could ruin every single friendship in existence. After I started playing among us I realized who I really was. I liked lying so much that I started doing it with every single person in my life. I went to highschool and told one teacher about this one dude I didn't like (call him Roland) has a relationship with another teacher, let's call her ms X, even tough there was nothing between them. I also reported that ms X was threatening Roland's family and he won't say anything. Ms X got relieved of her duties and went to prison while Roland ended up being sent to intensive therapy for trauma and lying  even tough he was saying the truth, that the relationship never happened. I also told the boy's parents that the only thing that brings a smile on his face are bracelets I get from a cousing from Spain and I need more money to buy them. That's how I got investment for my first marijuana farm. When Roland ended his life because no one believed what he was saying and thought he was continuing to lie, I made sure to pay 50/50 of my profit to his caretaker, in order to hide his death and keep sending letters to the parents, because I wanted to get more money from his parents. And you know, I took some money from here, some money from there, bribed some people, but how it is my fault that they accepted what I proposed to them ??? And if I donate 0.01% of my wealth to charity this will surely wash all my sins, because that's how the world works when you have money.

Anyway the farm is going good, and my life even better, Among us 10/10 inspiring game, would recommend to any aspiring drug lord."

Technology can't stop it's cold embrace
While hope within lives on
I slip into a darkness far beyond

I'm floating free untethered all alone
I'm breathing deep but oxygen is low
And rescue's much too far
I'm lost among the stars

I sleep all day and drift all night
Chasing after dreams I've got a home 
Somewhere inside
I just can't let go

I see my face reflected back at me
On helmet glass into eternity
Tears fall from my eyes
Memories return one final time

Tender words that I can almost hear
A passing glance that never became clear
Whispers of the past
Now indiscriminate

Red was not the imposter...

29017,probably one of the best minigame type games to play when you and your friends are really bored or feeling like hanging and having a fun time <3
29018,YO This game is famous due to its intense GAME!
29019,among us fun
29020,"The young community that plays this game can be toxic at times, but the game is otherwise fun to play with mature people. Great concept and a fresh genre for me. The servers however need work, if my ping jumps even for a couple seconds I will get kicked from the match."
29021,oh lord the amongoloids are plentiful
29022,It's sussy
29023,Fun times
29024,i like that you have to create a strategy to do defeat the impostor or as the impostor you have to hide that your the person killing all the crews while they try to figure out who the murderer is and the new roles are insanley fun to play with.
29025,"This  game reminds me of old board games bringing back old memories. It's really nice to be played in a group of close friends, though playing it with a group of random players makes game even more exciting and unpredictable, I need to mention that the PC version has a bunch of interesting roles that you won't find on your free Android version. 
Rating 8/10"

29080,"There are way too many things wrong with this wannabe-game. Some major flaws include:
*some players call emergency meeting without any cause... wasting everyone's time and really taking away any fun that was still left in playing Among Us...
*meeting countdown WAIT before you can vote... WHY waste everyone's time by making them wait x amount of seconds before being able to start voting??? and why even have the option to vote when the game just started and it is impossible to know who are impostors
*after you voted, you must often wait to infinity and beyond for others to vote... sometimes everyone is waiting for just one player to vote, before everyone can get on with the game
*after you (and some friends) finish all tasks... you literally have nothing to do but run around like a moron, until everyone else finish their tasks as well
*on some maps sabotage is way too easy for impostors and almost impossible to stop... especially when you need to have 2 players doing the ""task"" to stop the sabotage
*some games wait forever in the ""lobby"" and they don't start
*and the list goes on..."

29084,"They took a game that was ""sign in and play"" instantaneous and made it total dogshit with sign ons and all kinds of garbage."
29085,"Of course, as time goes on, the game is basically irrelevant, but it would still recommend this game to anyone to have a great time. Among Us was a big part of 2020 and it grew some of the best content creators ever."
29086,Wanna have fun with friends? Introduce them to among us.
29087,"As much as I hate saying it, I was a Discord mod when this game was popular. This fucking video game was a cyst on my servers for months, no, **years**. I have grown so sick and tired of hearing about it. I fucking hate Among Us. If I was in a room with six man-eating animals and a revolver, I'd shoot the computer playing the imposter theme six times.

BUT. My girlfriend bought me this game as a joke, and she eventually won me over to try playing a round or two with some friends. ""Two games"" turned into maybe five and an hour. It was a quick hour - a lot of fun. Among Us might not be so bad once every few months, but I know that with enough time, if I started taking this game seriously, I would hate it like any other multiplayer game. This is especially true if you play in public lobbies.

The addition of the battle pass system and weird collaborations has me thinking there's gonna be some weird developments in the future. But, at the same time, it's only - what - $5? Not too bad for a few hours of fun. Play it sparingly, remember not to take it too seriously, and you'll probably have a dumbass smile like I did."

29089,"El juego esta genial, es muy  divertido y te permite interactuar mucho con diferentes personas, pone a prueba tus habilidades de deducción y de actuación a la vez, muy muy entretenido e interactivo.

29146,"Let me tell you the story about how I destroyed the right side of my body. About 2 months ago, I had my family over to celebrate a birthday. I was in charge of the snack and food platters, bringing stuff around the house and making sure everyone had drinks aswell. While I was in the garage pouring chips into a bowl, my little cousin was whining that he wanted to play in the basement (which is my man cave where I have my PC/Xbox and whatnot) and my aunt kept saying ""not right now sweetie, you can't go downstairs until your cousin goes with you."" So I told her that it was ok and that I would get him set up on the Xbox and go back down and hang out with him once I finished setting up everything. So he turns on the lights and goes darting downstairs and I follow. Keep in mind that I am still holding the big bowl of chips so I can't really see in front of me at all. You can see where this is going. He gets to the bottom and runs over to my work out area with all my weights and equipment. I wanted to keep up with him so I can watch over him and get him away from the heavy stuff, so I started to go downstairs in a hurry. In doing so I misjudged my step and started falling down the stairs. Now, I wasn't tumbling or anything, I fell forward and twirled left, so I was airborne falling down a half a flight of stairs. Time slowed down for a second and I hit the floor on my right side. The chips went exploding out of the bowl, and I banged my arm and ribs up so I just stayed on the floor, not moving, just laying on my side waiting for the pain to subside a bit. Little man comes running over. Standing about 3 feet above me, he looks down with a blank stare for a second, and then with a smile, shouts ""Among Us!"" Like it was a reference or something. He then with the same smile, didn't move and just kept staring at me as I laid down painfully in a pile of Doritos. I still don't get why he said that. Please help"

29157,"Among us is one of the best games for a group of friends. The rules of the game are simple. Depending on the mode we play, there may be one to 2 or 3 cheats and the rest of the players are crew members. The trickster's job is to kill all crew members, and the crewmate's job is to either complete all their tasks or find the imposter. I rate the game at 7.5 / 10"

I am looking forwards to what Innersloth has in store for us in the future, but I also do understand the amount of time that's needed to implement these changes- the wellbeing of the minds behind the game are of above importance, after all.

Overall, I give this game an 8/10; there are still some glitches that need to be fixed, but it remains to be an enjoyable game overall."

29169,"This game used to be good but they ruined it with the new account creation system. I had the worst experience trying to set up an account after the game entered the age as the default. The default being the current day so the game thinks i'm less than a month old and does not allow me to use many of the basic functions of the game. For example, the free chat is unavailable to me because of this one simple miss-click.

There is an option to change the age through the innersloth parent portal however the only way to ""prove"" you are an adult is to either put in your social security number or your debit card information and I'll be damned if I am ever going to give that or any other info to Innersloth.

This is all not even to mention that the matchmaking has been kind of ruined by the divide of free and set chat being that people using one setting cannot join the lobby of someone using the other. This makes you have instances of trying to join friends' games and having to fumble through the settings to find the correct chat settings to play with your friends.

Honestly disappointed with how far this game has fallen from grace. Though it could be redeemed I don't foresee it happening. Please address these issues soon as it makes the game borderline unplayable for many people.

29191,"As someone who has nearly all the achievements and an ironic amount of playtime at the moment of reviewing, I feel as though I am legally obligated to review this game.

I'll spare you the history lesson here, as you probably know what Among Us is. I'll just talk about the new update and my experience with it. The new update includes 4 new roles, 3 of them are for Crewmates and the other is for Impostors. Scientist, Engineer, Guardian Angel, and Shapeshifter. The Scientist can access the Vitals from anywhere, and any time. Engineers can vent, just like Impostors. Do note that the abilities of Scientist and Engineer get disabled if the Comms Sabotage occurs. The Guardian Angel is given to  you upon being voted out or being killed by an Impostor. It allows you to break the game by shielding Crewmates and disabling an Impostor's Kill Button for an entire round. The Shapeshifter is an Impostor-Exclusive, and allows you to become any Crewmate that is/was alive during a current round. Anybody from a previous round cannot be shifted into.

Now, with all that info, it sounds like a recipe for disaster. And that's because it is.

Public Lobbies are a sight to behold. Sometimes, they are really nice and filled with fun people to talk to. The others have you talking to people named after very... bad things. Or words, even. They also say interesting things too. 15 players is a recipe for a larger cake, and a larger cake means more toppings. What does this mean? I don't know, still figuring it out.

Also, levels. Used for unlocking cosmetics and being harrassed by others for playing the game a lot. Fun!

If you are someone who is thinking of playing this game aside from the memes, play with your friends. If you're an achievement hunter... good luck!"

29194,"Great game, but devs needed to hire a bigger team and keep adding content to the game while it was still the biggest game in the world. They were making boatloads of cash and still just a 3 man dev team, blaming that for the slow progress? Bruh. Anyway yeah it was fun while it lasted."

29225,After last patch my character and DLC disappeared. Game support is ignoring me for over 2 week. Stay away from this game it is dot want to lose your money and time. Also this game has the worst interface system i have ever seen in games.
29226,
29227,yes but no if bad wifi
29228,"""Among Us is a game that is very ambitious. Never before has a game been so good at making you absolutely despise people even if they don't deserve it. When you start playing Among Us, you will start trying to learn how to do each task and how to get better at telling if someone is lying. After about a year of Among Us however, you will know how to do each task with your eyes closed and you will realize that it is very hard to tell if someone is lying when all they do is type Dream's ""The Mask"" lyrics into the chat until they get voted off, just for someone else to pick up where they left off. All in all, Among Us is an amazing game.""

29243,"This game is a masterpiece of psychological horror. You are trapped in space, unable to flee, unable to escape, with murderous aliens who you do not understand and do not get the opportunity to understand. They are out for blood, YOUR blood. It's up to you to avenge the deaths of your friends, family, crewmates. Can you handle the pressure? Or will you crack under the weight of your suspicions?"

29281,"Played the game for some rounds, then left it for some time.
Then, when I started the game, I just clicked anything to remove all those stupid pop-ups telling me all the fancy new features... Well, there was one asking me for my age.
Now the game thinks I'm 3 weeks old (did this 3 weeks ago) and I can't play proper multiplayer! DAFUQ IS THIS SHIT!

The game requires me to get my ""guardian"" to enable some multiplayer features. Naturally I entered my personal email address and got a mail. They want me as my own guardian to proof that I'm old enough by entering payment methods or another think I do not want to send them...
There was a link ""This is not my child"" or something related to this - well I clicked it because ... THIS IS NOT MY CHILD, THIS IS ME!
Now this mail got blacklisted.
Tried to do it again with another email ... it is fucked again.
Then deleted my ""parental"" account on their website, now this email seems to be blacklisted AGAIN

Deleted the game data in appdata to reset my age, but the game keeps my broken child account.
Re-Installed it and it keeps my child account.

Can't recommend this stupid parental stuff."

29366,"Among Us (coloquially termed ""amogus"") teaches us to punish the minority and hate those who are different and unique as ""impostors."" Instead, I like the breath of fresh air this problem provides as a new perspective on deduction that is not ""red is sus, red vented, etc."" that has been dominating the jokes of my peers and the view of my feed. Yet, by trying to force this problem to conform to ""amogus,"" you yourself are trying to crush originality and uniqueness. Among Us is a game ultimately convincing us to conform to menial labor as ""tasks"" and accept the deal of being just like the rest of the crewmates."

29370,"My negative review is not about the game itself but the fact that they moved the dlc to be in-game micro transactions only.  Sort of takes away the opportunity for players to get the dlc during steam sales. I did buy a fair amount of the dlc while it was on steam but now I've lost interest in purchasing more. The price for in-game currency is far more greater than what some of the individual steam dlc used to cost.  

I'm sure they need the money for game development and that is cool they deserve it. Just bummed that they had to take that rout and remove their dlc from the steam store."

29395,"This game used to be good, but with the accounts they've added earlier this year, it just became terrible. Now you need an account to change your username, which I can live with, but you also need an account to basically use chat. So, they just made their game trash, and I hope they fix it soon. I realize that they won't do anything if no one says anything (I'm sure other people have talked about this, actually), so I am now posting this review."

29420,"11th September, 2020. I wake up from a long slumber, I don't know where I am, who I am, what I'm doing. I've lost everything, yet I still somehow feel contempt, like an innate feeling that I can't escape. I arise from the tarnished bed-sheets to see... nothing. Nothing of note or memorability, at least, besides a glimmer; a twinkle, of something. Hope, fear, escape, freedom, the indescribable emotions I feel from the moment I wake up, it matters not what it is, I walk towards it. As I get closer, my passion gets stronger. Tears begin to ebb and flow from my eyes as I reach my destination in desperation for closure, for answers, for understanding. It's all come into vision now: A small, oak desk. Upon it rests a standard laptop, a mouse and my debit card. Instinctively, as if i'd been here before, I typed the my account, my password, the game's name, and of my bank details (VISA, 4024007164670431, 9/2023, 787), and await the download. I'm finally here. My past, the present, the fear of the future, it's all futile as I weep with joy as i experience the immaculate graphics, blissful music, inspiring art direction, and heartwarming story of Innersloth's 2018 hit game: Among Us. My life is complete. I can rest now."

29459,Excellent Co-op game with many different levels and tasks that can be completed to win the game. There are also a number of items and skins for your character. The game assigns you randomly as the enemy or as part of the crew where you must try to work out which of your crew mates is the enemy. There can be more than one enemy depending on how many people are playing. Fun game to play with friends online and no one knows whether they will be the enemy or a crew mate or if any of their friends are the enemy.

HUGE props to Innersloth for their graceful, transparent and humble handling of the Among Us phenomenon.  They know their playerbase well and have set an outstanding example for game companies everywhere!

29498,"Many other social deduction games try to mimic the game or even add to it, but Among Us creates an experience that just could not be captured by other games in the same genre (despite the memes). 

The tasks are simple and easy to follow which removes a common barrier for entry to new players (and non-gamers)
There is only one clear goal for the crew and the impostor, and games aren't dragged out by a ton of unnecessary objectives
The exciting and tense parts rely on the social aspect, not the gameplay, making it a very enjoyable game to play with friends"

Among Us is unironically a good game. It may make your brain go insane because of pattern recognition, but after some practice it's a really fun game. It's not that good if you're tired and just want to game at 3 A.M., because you actually need to use your brain and strategize. Even though it's a meme, it's really a great game! If you're thinking about buying it, go right ahead! It's well worth the price if you have a sherlock brain."
29586,ok
29587,"This game saved my life.

I am 69.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

29594,"'Among' all of the social deduction games I've played, Among Us takes the cake.  Among Us adds active action to the deduction and doesn't usually take years to finish.  Players will always find that they have something to do and not feel like they're on the sidelines (Secret Hitler, Town of Salem, Mafia).  Playing as any role is fun and exciting (Hey Town of Salem, does Executioner, Vampire Hunter, and Veteran ring a bell?  No, they just don't exist that well?  Okay.).  It also teaches that cooperation is necessary to win unlike Town of Salem does where you can sacrifice town members and still win."

The art and animation updates have been super nice to see, and the new roles update has been fantastic!  Mods have always been nice, but very buggy, so the dev support is great.

Playing online with randoms can be pretty annoying, because people will randomly vote and not communicate, but it is one of the funnest and most hilariously anxiety inducing games I've ever played with my friends and family."

29701,"Among Us is a very fun and educational game if you look at it from a pov of wanting to have fun you can do so by playing with friends and testing eachother or you could look at a educational pov because the game is about remembering, deception, detective work and speech. Thats why Among Us is a very good game but the servers are a bit buggy and need some fixing but overall it is a fantastic game."

29821,"It's very fun, the Customization is amazing, and being able to unlock new hats in this update makes it EVEN BETTER! Another great thing is you can pick how many Imps instead of being stuck with how many you started the game with, and the 4 extra roles can be edited and turned off if you like! Though you probably can't get the main packs the game has from before the most recent update, AKA they may still cost money, this game is extremely fun to investigate, and help your side win. And it's super exciting when you get an Achievment! I recommend this to ages 4+, or an age you or your child can understand it, read, and type, or just Read."
29822,"Can't even play the game, servers are ALWAYS messed up. It's been a whole year and a bunch of updates, they still haven't upgraded the servers... Come on if I buy a game I expect to at the very least be able to play it.

29852,amogus
29853,It is fun to play with the boys from now and then.
29854,"it is creative how it looks
it is fun game
and creators are still updating it"
29855,"pretty suspicious

it can be a pretty fun game for a little bit but it gets quite boring fast imo"
29856,fun
29857,cool but my uncle is still pretty sus when not playing tho
29858,"When I first got Among Us, it quickly became the most played game in my library because it was so fun.
I loved being the impostor, and I was very good at getting kills with no one noticing, and putting the blame on someone else so I never got voted out. 
Also, the crewmate role wasn't so bad either, the tasks were fun to do and some of them were very cool.
However, I did get tired of it soon after the Airship map came out, but now with the new update and all, I've gotten back into it again.
All in all, I definitely would recommend getting Among Us, it is a very fun experience that is to be enjoyed, though  it can get old once and a while."
29859,"It is Good. Ignore the annoying kids who play this. Get some friends, some food, and some water. And you'll enjoy this."
29860,"Its SUPER fun to play, even better with friends or just with voice chat. 
The updates add quite a bit of content each time and the game keeps getting better. 
I'd say if you haven't already, go play among us its amazing. 10/10 would be sus again"
29861,Its fun. A voice chat feature would be cool.
29862,Amogus 😃
29863,sus lmfao
29864,qko
29865,cool game :]

29867,"A sleeper hit from 2018 that blew up in 2020, and a very good take on the social deduction genre.

Provided you have a good lobby, anyway. Many public lobbies default to seriously unbalanced settings and are filled with selfish players who leave immediately if they aren't an Impostor. If you don't have a large enough friend group to play this with voice chat, it can take a bit of effort to foster a lobby that gets the most out of the game. But if you have or can, it's definitely worth it."
29868,is yes
29869,",,,,,.........."
29870,I like this game.
29871,so sussy
29872,.

29878,"nice game. 












SUSSUSSUSSUSSUS amogus"
29879,"Among Us is a rather suspicious multiplayer game where a group of ""crewmates"" try to determine who the ""impostor"" is. It is a rather enjoyable multiplayer game and the latest update brought a bit of life back into the game. Among Us is quite a bit more enjoyable with friends."
29880,GUS
29881,"Family friendly, rage inducing, friendship ending game. If you wanna be a psycho and kill someone just grab this"

29892,A great game to play with friends and start doubting everyone :D
29893,overrated
29894,maybe the real imposter was the friends we made along the way
29895,"The point system where you buy it is fucking bad because the creators only care about american s and not European.
