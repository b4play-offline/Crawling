37,"I love this game, it brings back childhood memories, I've played it through my teenage years and it was the foundation for other FPS games in the industry, valve back then were unbeatable."
38,"reviews with thousands of hours we'll never get back says it all. it's a great addition to have in your steam library, most especially if you grew up playing counter-strike."
39,"Counter-Strike 1.6 is the game which started it all for me. I played CS 1.5 before, but I moved quickly to 1.6 as all of the players in my neighborhood in Karachi, Pakistan were playing 1.6. I got so attached and addicted to it that I even failed my 7th Standard haha.

All in-all, I learnt that games should be taken seriously but not that seriously that one loses in real life. I have both love and hate for this game. I enjoyed a lot. Thanks for the memories."

67,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

I suggest playing with friends because i couldnt find any cool servers (unballanced zombie mod servers, dUsT 2 OnLy!!1!!1 servers with russian cheaters). Also if you think the guns in this game are good and crouching gives you good accuracy, no. Guns in this game are absoulute hot garbage, like it's almost unplayable. Balance is really poor. And if ur a new player that thinks playing with bots on ""normal"" is going to be a fair challenge, well then you are wrong because the ""normal"" ai can be absolute bs."

241,"This game is good, but not as good as my cinnamon bread!

What you'll need:

- A 9x13 Pan (preferably glass)
- Non Stick Spray
- 2 Tubes of Biscuits (Pillsbury or Otherwise)
- 1 and 1/2 sticks of Salted Butter (Unsalted also works, just be sure to add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt in step 3)
- 4 Teaspoons of Brown Sugar
- 1 Teaspoon of Cinnamon
- 1 Tablespoon of Honey
- 2 Tablespoons of Milk, Heavy Cream, or Buttermilk (Non-Dairy Milks work as well. See Step for more info) (More as Needed)
- 2 Cups of Powdered Sugar (more as needed)

Step 1. Preheat your oven to 350 and give your pan a light coat of non-stick spray

Step 2. POP THEM BISCUITS OPEN BABY!!

Once you get the biscuits out, grab a butterknife (or use your hands you filthy animal) and quarter them. Start laying em out in the pan. Spaces in-between the biscuits is A-okay cause we want that buttersugar to get down in there once we start pouring. Likely, you'll run into the issue of ""too many biscuit pieces, not enough space"" so just kinda squish em down and try to fill in the edges and corners with an extra biscuit piece. Once you've got all the biscuits packed in there, we're on to step 3!

Step 3. BUTTERSUGAR TIME

Grab your 1 and 1/2 Sticks of butter and we're gon' melt that son of a gun. Personally, I like to melt butter in the microwave, but if you wanna get all fancy and pull out the saucepan then go for it. Ain't nobody stopping you.

So for the rest of us common folk, put your butter in a microwave safe bowl or Pyrex measuring cup. I throw it in there for like 1min and just check on it closer to the minute mark, but we all got different microwaves. Basically, you just want the butter to be melted with no chunks left in it. So however long it takes to do that. DON'T leave it in too long or it'll burn and then you gotta go get more butter.

NOW. You've got your melted butter. Add the Cinnamon and the brown sugar to it and stir the everliving life outta that thing til' it's all nice and pretty. Once you've successfully crafted the buttersugar, pour it over the biscuits in the pan. My two main goals here are ""1. Make sure every biscuit gets some love"" and ""2. Fill in all the cracks"" So pour slow and steady.

Step 4. MAKE IT HOT

Okay. Let me level with you here. I am not a classically trained baking professional. I'm just a regular schmegular person who likes the sweety sweets. I have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ these up before and this is the step that made my spouse leave.

Double check the oven is on 350. Put the little biscuits in the oven so that they can grow up to be big and strong. Leave them in there for about 10-13min. Be sure to check on your biscuits throughout the process. What you're looking for is the tops to be golden brown. Like that real fresh baked brown, that you see in the movies and tv and recipe sites. Once you see golden brown, open the oven and don't be afraid to get a little greedy. Grab a biscuit off the top so you can see how the middle section and bottom of the pan look.

If it looks doughy Turn the oven off and let the biscuits sit inside for maybe 5 minutes. Again, note the color of the tops and go back to your reference piece that you took out. You want them to look like done biscuits. I can't put pictures but I'll make a guide if people are interested and go back through all the steps with pictures.

If it doesn't look doughy Well then what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing? Move on to the next step champ! We got biscuits to eat!

Step 5. Make the Glaze

In a good sized bowl, whisk together your Powdered sugar, honey, and milk. If you don't have a whisk, that's fine. Just go grab a utensil or something. Personal preference: Fork. They look meaner than the other utensils.

NON-DAIRY MILK USERS UNITE!
I really like an almond milk substitute here, but whatever works, works. Just know, with the amount of ingredients we're using here, your glaze may come out thin and runny. If it does, don't panic and cry. Just add a little more powdered sugar in tablespoon increments. Add, whisk and repeat if it still comes out runny. Once it's thick enough, go ahead on.

Take your whisked mixture and and drizzle it over the finished biscuits. And boom done. You just baked something delicious.

If you read this far, thank you. If you liked the recipe, thank you. I'll try to make a guide and go back through with pictures and gifs to make this a lot easier to follow if enough people want that.

Call the ones you love, tell em you love them.

Let me know what recipe you want me to do next."

246,"Met the most beautiful person here, good experience and community is really nice most of the time. Older players were usually really nice to younger newcomers to the game and that is really satisfying.  When there was the cheating thing I never really bothered that much. The only thing I dislike is that you cant zoom with your weapon. This game relays a lot on single play performance and that is not something I like too much.
Not saying that the game is focused on performance of an individual but I always had feeling of a burden playing counter strike series most of the time being deadweight or the last person in the scoreboard which I never really hated. Never played source that much but overall very good experience. I never understood the aiming still to this day. Favorite weapon obviously M4. People on servers hated me for shield playstyle, BEST DAYS gg. The nickname even tho if I remember correctly the guys that gave me even said I should change it a little. Thanks for the times with the girl early in my childhood growing up."

252,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is"

300,"Heijan - Mame Haci Part 3
Gene bu beat oldu derdime çare
Nasıl bir müzikse oldum avare
Ayan abi hani yok mu çiçek
Mugo hani varsa yapıştırın içek

Gene burası Bağcılar mugo baba dur
Aha aha geldiler durun
İçimde çıldırıyo bu içimde deli heijan
Beat’e ses verin sonra susun lan

Torbacı gaspçı balleciyle hırsız
Emiyet polis yunuslar paket
Hurra nazaret sonra mahkeme
Soğuk dört duvar yok yok bi merhamet

Ben yazıyom mugo çok neşeli
Aha amcalar geliyo endişeli
Gene Heijan orda yapmasın bi delilik
Çabuk geç diyo diline düşmeyelim

Hepsinin derdi ben bense deli
Şehrimi yazıyom tedirgin hepsi
Torbacılar doğan işimizi verme
Polisler bizi sakın etiket etme

Dilimin ucunda dolanıyonuz hepiniz
Yazarsam inan ki olay olursunuz
Benim işim bu ben gerçeği yazıyom
İşte bu yüzden bu semti seviyorum

Mame haci seni de yazam mı?
Ben kari istirem sende var mı?
Neneye ne oldu aha var ya seninki
Bu yaşlandi bana yeni kari lazım

Bakkal amca mugo seni yazayım mı?
Karşıya döner dükkanımı açsam
Bakkalın neyi var neyine yetmi
Veresiye vere vere bakkalmı kaldı

Manav amca seni yazayım mı?
Çürüğü alta koy kimse görmesin
Ayıptır amca günahtır inan ki
Nimettir oğlum bu çöpe atılır mı?

Gel de yazma böyle neşe dururken
Al sana Bağcılar işte ticaret
Gel şehrime geç köşeleri seyret
Merak ettiğin her şeyi keşfet

Burda hayat hızlı ayak uydur koş
Duranı ezerler olursun folloş
İstediğin rap se beat’e ver ses
Sonra dinle burda bol Beyonce

Gene manita triplerde hayrola
Fazla basınca kırıldı karyola
Dinlemedi velet acemi misali
Patlayınca hapı kaydı şemali

Gene beni ona buna soran o insana
Tek bi partla ben cevabı verdim
Niyetleri benimle bir savaşsa eğer
Alayına farkımı farkettirdim

Gece yarısı sokaklarda bi hırsız
Trilyon kafası tilkiden farksız
İş başında paket oldu apansız
Sorunca hakime efendim masumuz

Oğlum bu ülkeyi soydunuz
Bu millette huzur yok amına koydunuz
Şimdi övün sen işinle kusursuz
Dara düşünce tabi siz masumsunuz

Herhangi ünlünün ayağı kaysa
Sabah gastelerde büyük manşet
Oğlum bizim hayatımız kaymış
Kapıyı çalan yok nasıl bi adalet

Gel baba burası Türkiye
Paran varsa adamsın lan işte
Adaletten söz etmesin kimse
Açlıktan ölenleri gördüm ben

İstanbul size göre cennet di mi?
Bir de bize sorun nasıl bir cehennem
Düştümmü tutan yok inan bana
Kaybolursun çıkmaz bi sokakta

Ben neşesinde yazsamda bu beat’e
Sesimi duyunca hüzünlenecekler
Çünkü gerçekleri yazıyor bu kalem
Korku saracak tribe girecekler

Çağımızın sorunu abazalık
Kimi görsek baba ama harmanım diyor
Herşeyi anlıyorum da birader
Bu Haydar Dümen nasıl bir kafa yaşıyor

Çözemedim bilemedim bir türlü ben
Bu yüzden affına sığınıyorum gel
Şaşırmış millet lan artık edep yok
Televizyonda karı pazarlıyolar

Ev araba yat bir de maaş derken
Yetmiş yaşında gelin oluyorlar
Vergiye tabi onca kerhane
Ama lafa gelince müslümanız be

Sen kendini kandır dümenci ibne
Ya da mektup yaz Haydar Dümen’e
Gençleri merak etme çoğu meşgul
Okumdan pilot olma yolundalar
Çok yakında mugo aya çıkacaklar
Sana ordan kafasını salacaklar

419,"I am a 58-year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing CS 1.6. I am a single father to my son, who is now 15. My son recently started playing CS 1.6. In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing CS 1.6. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. CS 1.6 reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

424,"While at first glance this game may look old, it hasn't aged at all. This game feels the exact same as it did back in 2005. I can honestly say that this game has stood the test of time better than any other game I can think of. This is the king of all competitive FPS games. It may have been dethroned when CS:GO was released in 2012, but this game will never truly die. Even if the day comes when there are zero servers, this game will still be alive. It will be alive in the hearts and souls of all of those players who have had the joy of discovering and playing this game over the last 19 years and counting. Even today in North America, you can find competitive pick up games - sure, it might be with people who don't speak your language, and some people may cheat or leave early, but it's doable. And if you happen to live in Europe, there is still an active competitive community over there. There aren't many players left, but there are players, and this game is an absolute gem. I would recommend this game even today, due to the extremely high quality, and most of all, fair mechanics this game offers."

471,Game can be fun depending on what group of sexy boomers you get the cranky unmarried ones get tilted really fast if you are better and start kicking you and banning you from their servers and than the married one's who are funny as heck unfortunately got stuff to do plus there's less of them so overall the servers are a bit unplayable. But still the CS i know as i got called Tranny and the N word multiple times plus got a few dox and death threats by some older dudes which was kinda hot. SO HELL YEAH NOTHING I WOULD CHANGE ABOUT THIS GAME AT ALL.

475,"Meu avô fumou a vida inteira. Eu tinha uns 6 anos quando ouvi minha mãe dizer a ele: ''Se você quiser ver seus netos se formando, você tem que parar imediatamente''. Nunca tinha visto meu avô chorar antes, ele percebeu o quanto tinha a perder se continuasse a fumar. Ele jogou o cigarro que estava fumando no chão e falou que nunca mais ia fumar e se esforçou muito pra cumprir essa promessa, infelizmente, três anos depois ele morreu de câncer de pulmão. Foi muito triste e realmente me destruiu por dentro. A minha mãe desde então ficou me dizendo: ''Nunca fume. Por favor não deixe sua família passar pela mesma tristeza que seu avô nôs fez passar''. Eu concordei e prometi a mim mesmo nunca fumar. Aos 22 anos, mesmo após muitas tentações, nunca toquei num cigarro. Devo admitir que me arrependo profundamente disso, porque ver você jogando me deu câncer de qualquer jeito
"
476,It's still a better game than CSGO in my opinion and for many.

485,"I am a 14 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 3 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game,  I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

509,"The game crashes constantly, there is no implementation of bots, you need to run some strange executable from the Internet (security warning!) if you want to install it yourself, the game has serious problems.

If you feel like playing Counter-Strike 1.6 but don't know where to start, buy Counter-Strike Condition Zero, it's exactly the same game but with bots already implemented, cool hostages and sounds corrected, it has two versions in most maps, original (1.6) and the renewed one (Condition Zero), I like all versions.

I play Counter-Strike Condition Zero on Manjaro Linux using Proton and it improve the game quality further by implementing anti-aliasing, texture filtering and modern fonts in the main menu. I do not recommend this version here, it is very unstable. Go buy Counter-Strike Condition Zero!"

531,"I am recommending this because of nostalgia. If you are someone who has never played counter-strike 1.6, I would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counter-strike got its roots from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouch walking (some may call it silent-stepping, groundstrafing, g-stafing), quick-switching to reload faster, boosting people through roofs, the insane amount of wall bangs you can do. Some do raise the skill cap. Where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, bhopping was around before counter-strike but counter-strike had bhop communities as well. This is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models. This and counter-strike: condition zero are the only counter-strike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counter-strike which made knifing non-competitive. You could get a headshot with a knife; how could you not like that! The graphics are definitely dated by today’s standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it. Counter-strike does not have a built-in matchmaking ladder like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much esports history made in counter-strike. The reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement a cheating protection know as Valve Anti-Cheat with counter-strike being the main focus."

578,"CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best

game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.

It starts off with a team trying to kill another team.

CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.
ver the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.

In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6). POG GAME"

610,"I am a 78 yo grandfather, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 45 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2002 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my team and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died a grisly terrible death at the hands of chemotherapy. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well, but not a lot becasue our skin is sensitive to light (genetic condition look it up, keyworld ""albino""). This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories and we also have hamburger helper time when we win..."

694,"Playing this after playing hundreds of hours of CS:GO so this is a perspective from a CS:GO player.
I cannot wrap my head around first bullet accuracy just yet, i don't feel fully in control of my weapons (especially the AK47), but it seems like something i will be able to learn after more playing. it's the perfect game to just chill and frag some people if you're into CS, and unlike CS:GO this game is mostly cheater free.
I would still like to point out that the third person animations are kinda weird, but except that, it's pretty good.

I recommend it."

Entonces, una de las strippers me mira horrorizada y le digo: ""Tranquila, esto no es algo que no haya hecho antes en el GTA, ir al club de striptease es el pan de cada día"". Ante esta situación, el dueño del local se pone a gritar y yo le digo: ""¿Me vas a obligar a ponerme de puto a bailar para que os devuelva el dinero? Yo lo hago pero luego @Policía, ustedes saben lo que están haciendo"".

Y luego le digo: ""Mira, quedamos en esto: Ni yo he estado aquí, ni vosotros me habéis visto aquí. Borrando tetas, borrando tetas, borrando tetas, borrando tetas""."

Let me say that that was one of the most fun things I've gotten to do when it comes to gaming. The maps were so old we didn't even remember most of the maps layouts (not including the more popular ones like inferno, dust, or even assault), but the maps were so goofy it actually became very fun.

872,"This is the game that I spent a lot of time playing at friends houses and at my place. Whether it was during birthdays, weekends or schooldays we would all either play vs bots or if someone had internet we would play online. The whole competitive aspect of the game coupled with tryhard kids on bootleg PCs or even at school PCs was rather iconic for the 2000s in my country. Adding skins to the game took a bulk of my time with this game. Have a lot of memories here."

Online matchmaking is amazing since it consists of purely a server browser, that surprisingly holds up strong 22 years after it's initial release. Game is tiny aswell, <2 GB if I recall correctly. It's worth playing if you're into early 00s FPS or just want that feel of pre-millenial nostalgia. And if anyone wants to team, hmu hehe

Contains many different maps to choose from, Two different classes, Public server support, Modded servers, LAN Support, Downloadable maps, Custom sprays, Easy-to-learn rules, And so much more!
The rules are simple: You can either play on Counter-terrorist or Terrorist, Terrorists must kill all the Counter-terrorists and/or place and guard the bomb.

Counter-terrorists must find the hostages/ NPC's and bring them all to safety OR kill all the terrorists. Terrorists must guard their hostages and kill all the counter-terrorists. Enjoy!

Some of the staff played it and the place was meant to close at midnight, they'd lock up and join us playing for another hour or so if it was good crack."

My favourite game is Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I have so many hours on it (almost too many) and I thought about trying the game that started it all, aside from Half-Life, since it was on sale for a few bucks. It was terrible.

So, what do I think? I know the game is almost 22 years old as of writing this, so I will give it the benefit of the doubt. I'm sure Valve doesn't care one bit about keeping the community alive for this game, but it is almost unplayable. Sure, there is some nostalgia for those that played it back in the day, but you are way better off just playing CS:GO nowadays if you enjoy a stable game. 

There aren't any bugs or anything as Valve has always been pretty consistent with keeping a game in good shape, but the gameplay is pretty subpar for 2000. I know Counter Strike was just coming on to the scene that Call of Duty would soon overtake, but it plays like Doom from the 90's in my opinion. But, hackers are what ruin the game. It is downright unplayable because of how bad the aimbotting, flying, wallhacking, insta-killing, and many more hacks have gotten. If you load into a game, you will not get a single kill.

Even if this game becomes free at any point, do not get it. It will just waste your storage space that could be used for playable games. But props to Valve for evolving from this mess into the CS:GO we love today. <3

1195,"Best multiplayer fps ever. Games may come and go but CS 1.6 stands tall, always.

What makes it so good though? Is it the graphics? Is it the game-play? Or is it something else? Well, the graphics are pretty simple, so is the game-play but what makes it stand out perhaps is the in-game physics and the skill cap.

It's a game which takes a while to master and no matter how much good you become, there's always someone who can teach you a new trick. Also, it's both skill and strategy so even if you aren't the best shooter, with a proper team and enough tactics, you can gain victory against someone better.

This game has given me infinite memories and still is creating newer ones. I really owe a lot to this game. Life is 1 but CS is 1.6.. forever :)"

Volvio hasta la entrada, agarro un numero y se acerco al mostrador, otra vez en un tono de voz alto ""QUIERO DOS PIZZA Y UNA DOCENA DE EMPANADAS DALE APURATE QUE EMPIEZA DRAGON BALL"" decidi tomar la orden de el primero para no tener mas problemas, le pregunte de que gusto queria ""LO QUE TENGAS A MANO CAPO DALE METELE"" agarre las sobras que habian quedado de una orden anterior y se lo meto en la caja, le digo ""TOMA GORDO TERMOTANQUE"" acto seguido, veo como me tira un billete de $500 arriba del mostrador y sale corriendo, mete todo en el asiento del auto y se va a 200km por hora

1414,"It’s called (Half-Life) Counter-Strike for a reason. It will take up half of your life. It’s a good game, but perhaps, too good. It will completely hijack the reward system in your brain. 20 years later and all the time spent and I have nothing to show for it. Just the memories, good vibes, and great people along the way. You may stop playing for awhile but you’ll always be back. This game is timeless, more adult friendly, and not as toxic as other competitive games. Counter-Strike is more about having fun and show casing personal skill than it is trash talking your own teammates like other games. The community is filled with many dedicated and friendly players 20+ years after release."

There are some bad memories, some good, mostly good with this game. Had fun playing many tournaments, game introduced me to many legendary people who are my friends now. Apart from some toxic people, gaming wise, this is a must play."

1534,"[h1] *HARMFUL PRODUCT WARNING!!!* [/h1]

First of all: FRUTA QUE PARIU.

 Yesterday (March 15th) was my birthday and my friend gave me the classic CS as a birthday present.

Little did i Know that this was a Trojan Horse (no. not the virus. the REAL trojan horse)

while in-game, my PC started to get blue dots on the screen and suddenly reset. 
after the sudden reboot, it started to get a black screen and that was it.

i've restarted it over 10 times and realized i had to use safe mode to turn it on and delete this SHITTY GAME FILE so it could turn on again normally. 

Please, if you love your family; do NOT, absolutely, do NOT GIVE THEM THIS GIFT! 
AND DO NOT BUY THIS OLD GAME. buy CS GO instead.

this is a harmful piece of software. [h1] You want to disable a bomb? fine. do it in videogames. not in real life by letting your PC to run this piece of crap. [/h1]"

The bhops are crisp in 1.6 physics not so much in its successor GO. The unique feature wall bang is reserved to this game alone. All the different server and different mods, gungame, deathmatch, nightcrawler, zombies, base builder, surf and countless I can't recall atm. The maps are engraved in da brain dd2, inferno, aztec, nuke, cobble, italy, office, fy_snow, fy_poolday, afk_6killer. Used to play this on win 95 on pentium 3.

1676,"It's a keeper. Regardless of it's outdated ""everything"", it still speaks for it's age and saga. Go for it without rethinking twice especially if you need a really classic (dare I say basic) FPS game in the Police V/S Criminal setting for very basic system requirements."

1781,"Всем привет. Раньше я не понимал, почему так много людей играет в это, но, зайдя в игру, я понял! Сказать, что я был шокирован- ничего не сказать. Как оказалось, моя мама ночная бабочка, а отец умер в болоте. Все это произошло после того, как я убил игрока, которому было лет 13 от силы. Замечательная игра с невероятными хит-боксами и физикой, прекрасные тиммейты турки, поляки, которые могут кикнуть лишь за то, что ты поздоровался с ними на русском. В общем, ставлю этой игре 10 из 10 агрессивных школьников по шкале ГЕЙБА."

1790,"One of oldest, and so far best fps game I tried. The hit boxes made sense on a very great level. The gameplay is amazing. You pretty much had to be a dead shot to have any type of kill, giving this game a score less than 10, will result in shame. Every weapon is completely balanced, and even a hand gun can do the trick if you know how to use it, its you, the mouse, the gun, rifle or knife, the target retical, and your enemies face or body.

In short that would be all I had to say about this game:)  [h1][b] 10/10 [/b]"

1819,Multiplayer gameplay is based around abusing the limitations of the game engine.
1820,"One of my all time favorite classic games, highly recommended. Especially if you want a chill, laid-back, straight forward FPS game. Tons of great mods available as well!"
1821,Ностальжи
1822,Atemporal
1823,good old CS
1824,"The classic CounterStrike experience in HD, CS 1.6 is the upgrade to CS 1.5 that you never wanted. Yes, it adds HD skins and new weapons, but it messes up the buy menu and has worse bots, as even though zBot learns a map faster than any other bots, they aren't so able when it comes to orientation. I prefer RealBot anytime.

Also, for some reason I notice they don't come preinstalled anymore, so you have to install zBot separately now. When 1.6 first launched, they came preinstalled.

I still recommend the game as the only way to play classic CS on modern computers, but if you have a retro machine at your disposal and copies of your old Half-Life retail CDs, you're better off using that and installing 1.5 + RealBot."

1847,"Very fun game, but no Chinese,"
1848,You can't go wrong with this timeless classic
1849,"Choose your team, play the first round with pistols, buy a better weapon for the next rounds, try to kill as much as possible without dying. Repeat this for countless hours until you lose track of time.
CS is easily one of the most addictive games I've ever gotten my hands on, no question.
The premise is quite simple: divide people into 2 teams, in one game mode one side must plant a bomb and the other tries to defuse it; in the other game mode one team tries to rescue the hostages and the other team tries to stop them. Simple, but this simplicity has flawless mechanics, extremely dynamic matches, and a variety of scenarios that make the strategies different in each of them.
Within its proposals Counter-Strike, originally a Half-Life mod, is basically perfect, the only thing that could be thought of would be eventual new maps, but it's an almost endless variable (a problem solved with mods, patches, etc). For the genre, it's a ""must-play"". Play CS at your own risk, maybe completely lose track of time."

I recommend it for nostalgia. If you are someone who has never played Counterstrike 1.6 before, it would be hard to recommend it unless you want to check where the Counter-Strike came from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouching walking (some might call it silentstepping, groundstrafing, gstafing), quick jump to reload faster, pushing people to rooftops, insane amount of wall hits that you can do. Some increase the skill limit. Where this game shone for me is the modding community and custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, bhopping was there before counterstrike but counterstrike also had the bhop community. This is where weapon skins came from when modders created custom weapon models and custom player models. This and Counter-Strike: condition zero are the only counterstrike games to have a competitive knife community as the knife mechanics have been changed to other counter attack versions which made the knife uncompetitive. You can receive a blow to the head with a knife; how not to like that!Graphics are decidedly outdated by today's standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor is not as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-Strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the community and the mods that have sprung up around it. Counter-Strike does not have a built-in matchmaking scale like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much history of esports counterattacking. the first was to provide people with a more efficient way to update their games and a way to implement cheat protection known as ValveAntiCheat with the counter-strike as the primary focus. This game reminds you of how good you were as a kid and few games can match the impact Counter-Strike has had on the esports and gaming industry.

But that's about it, it's fun, but I prefer CS:GO for its gun play and balancing. 1.6 still holds off pretty well, and the community is surprisingly still active, though toxic as always. :) Overall, it's a bit harder to play than CS:GO, but it remains a stable classic and a game worth revisiting."

2130,.
2131,"Counter-Strike is originally a fan-made modification for Half-Life about the confrontation between terrorists and special forces, created specifically for the multiplayer mode. The modification has gained immense popularity and has grown into a whole series of games (CS: Source and CS: Global Offensive). Players in the role of members of two teams will have to fight each other on a variety of maps in several different modes (demining, hostage rescue, and others). The goal of each team is either to fulfill a certain condition of the mode, or to destroy the entire enemy team. Each player has one ""life"" per round, and in case of death can not affect the battlefield in any way."
2132,"The game has seen its many ups and downs but it's online community still backs it 100%. Due to its age its flaws have been more an more noticeable, since other fps have improved and shown that there is more then just counter-strike. Yet no other fps has been able to completely topple this game. Yes its numbers are slowly dieing off but everyone who's played this game agrees that when they decide to develop counter-strike 2 it will be the next king of fps. The game its self is a simple concept, two different teams. Counter Terrorist or Terrorist and you objective reflects what side your on."

2205,YES!

2207,"Yes I do recommend this game Counter-Strike 1.6.
It feels like Counter-Strike source but doesn't take too much storage so it's easy to play. The servers are still going which is pretty good for a game that's been around for over 20 years. Uses the gold source engine if you're not familiar with it's the predecessor to the source engine. 

The controls are pretty good. the combat's pretty good.

Doesn't take up too many megabytes if it's easy for like a 20 year old computer to run so that's good. 

If you don't want to play global offensive because it's too competitive you can play this this is an option.

Is it worth $10 yes it is. 

The game also has mod support."
2208," High speed action with plenty of in game options.
  Uncomplicated game play."
2209,scoutzknivez and knivez only is so fun in this game with gravity
2210,"I recommend it for nostalgia. If you are someone who has never played Counterstrike 1.6 before, it would be hard to recommend it unless you want to check  where the Counter-Strike came from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouching walking (some might call it silentstepping, groundstrafing, gstafing), quick jump to reload faster, pushing people to rooftops, insane amount of wall hits that you can do. Some increase the skill limit. Where this game shone for me is the modding community and  custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, bhopping was there before counterstrike but counterstrike also had the bhop community. This is where weapon skins came from when modders created custom weapon models  and custom player models. This and Counter-Strike: condition zero are the only counterstrike games to have a competitive knife community as the knife mechanics have been changed to other counter attack versions  which made the knife uncompetitive. You can receive a blow to the head with a knife; how  not to like that!Graphics are decidedly outdated by today's standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor is not  as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-Strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the community and the mods that have sprung up around it. Counter-Strike does not have a built-in matchmaking scale like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much history of esports counterattacking. the first  was to provide people with a more efficient way to update their games and a way to implement cheat protection known as ValveAntiCheat with the counter-strike as the primary focus. This game reminds you of how good you  were as a kid and few games can match the impact Counter-Strike has had on the esports and gaming industry."

2260,This game makes real CS:GO prodigy's. Best childhood game.. no cap.
2261,A shooting game where you can't aim because the bullets go anywhere but through the crosshair. Skating makes it impossible to move and stop effectively. Gameplay consists of being funneled down one of two corridors towards opponents pixel peaking you with one bodyshot kill rifles. It's amazing anyone actually plays this.

2275,This is the best game ever you can join ever server you wont!!! and even make you one server to  invite friends. This is my fav game and that's why i instilled it :) play it it's fun.
2276,"This game is a classic, even coming into it with no nostalgia and a high skill ceiling I will most likely never pass, it brought me a large group of friends to hang out with and a strong FPS experience. This community even if I only interacted on a surface level, is amazing, it makes me feel like I earned way more than what I originally purchased (It was on sale for about $2 but even if it was back to $10 that is a large leap) compared to every other FPS or Shooter I’ve ever played. I still need to put more hours in this game but I recommend this to anyone who has any form of interest in games with a gun, form of movement, care for positioning, and/or strategy. As someone who gets to experience a game that’s older than the player playing it, that’s saying how much the core gameplay holds up to this day, I strongly prefer this over CS:GO even."

2284,Hell yeah I can recommend this game!
2285,"""15 Hours"" is an understatement. Unfortunately, most of my thousands of hours poured into this title were prior to Steam and prior to time tracking on Steam.

1.6 is still a solid title - It's fun to run with bots, it's fun to run at LAN parties, it's fun to play Scoutz n Knivez, and jajajajaja cyka blyat.

It's a good game - I prefer it greatly to CS:GO from time to time still."

2308,This game is incredible and a classic. I love the mechanics of the game. But the lack of players makes it harder to find games. You should definitely buy this game if it goes on sale but when it is at full price I would recommend not purchasing it unless you really want it.
2309,"Here you will see why I love Counter-Strike, but in my review you will read about why I gave it a negative review due to some problems.

I love Counter-Strike I love the feel of Counter-Strike's guns more than Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Now I remember back in 2005 when I first played Counter-Strike it had DirectX 8 support and now with VALVe pushing Linux support and removing DirectX 8 from the Gold Source engine video games adding OpenGL support to the Gold Source engine video games I keep getting OpenGL errors every now and then and some freezing issues, which I do not remember ever happening with DirectX 8.

Here is a screenshot of one of the few OpenGL errors I experience here and there. Followed by freezing of the video games that use OpenGL, before crashing.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/887417416764768257/926930307003850792/OpenGL_errors_on_video_games_that_use_OpenGL_on_Windows.png

VALVe please add DirectX 8 support or at least a more up to date version of DirectX 9 support which supports 64-bit, which is DirectX 9.0C I believe?

Otherwise I cannot give Counter-Strike a positive review due to these technical issues, which I cannot seem to fix even if I reinstall Windows or Counter-Strike.

Also VALVe please release Counter-Strike with Counter-Strike Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source included for sale on gog.com. You have said with the Source 2 engine that video game developers developing video games on the Source 2 engine can release the video games that they develop for sale on gog.com please."

2321,"it's good, i had about 3000 hours on this game on another account"
2322,This is my Childhood Game 2007 what a good time
2323,"I started playing Counter-Strike 1.6 around the age of 9 (roughly 19 years ago). Online lobby's, CAL matches, CS Montages, all of those things brought so much joy to me as a child.  I will always remember Counter-Strike until the day I die, and it will go down as one of the greatest FPS of all time."

2331,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

2411,"Ultimate spaghetti carbonara recipe

100g pancetta
50g pecorino cheese
50g parmesan
3 large eggs
350g spaghetti
2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole
50g unsalted butter
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

STEP 1
Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.

STEP 2
Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.

STEP 3
Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.

STEP 4
Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).

STEP 5
Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.

STEP 6
While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.

STEP 7
Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.

STEP 8
Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.

STEP 9
Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.

STEP 10
Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.

STEP 11
Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.

STEP 12
Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived."

2545,ITS A COOL GAME.  REALLY COOL
2546,"The og cs 

"
2547,"A masterpiece. Not only amazing for its time, but I'm having a blast still playing it today.

The strongest point of this game is the engine - essentially the Half Life engine. Even to this day, no other engine that I've seen has managed to capture the intricate movement mechanics that CS 1.6 provides. The strafe-jumping, long-jumping, endless bunny-hopping, and the thousands of custom-made maps and addons there are give the player the utmost freedom to explore the CS 1.6 world and exploit the engine to its fullest potential.

The move to the source was a downgrade. It comes nowhere close to feeling as smooth and responsive as the Half Life engine.

Even though most of the servers are empty now, I still have a few that I frequent, with a healthy amount of players. And with the help of a few mods, LAN can provide just as much content.

Maybe it's not for everyone, especially for those that have become accustomed to the newest flashy Fortnite clone. But for me, the game deserves nothing less than a thumbs up.

2619,"A must buy. A classic, very fun, still very active after so many years. Good quality game, however, jumping back into it after not playing for a long time is super hard. Everyone in the game plays like they've been playing it every single day since it came out, it does have hard aiming mechanics and pretty in depth movement mechanics, but once you get used to it, it's a pretty fun game. Great for low end PC's, and most fun when played with friends."
2620,"this is a great game.  I've bought it, but I prefer to play on the crack version because there are already bots, amxxmod and more online servers in the crack version.  i usually play in offline mode with bots with respawn mod(CSDM)"

2661,"Old is gold, (G)old.

Old is gold is that whatever is old is as important as gold. 
We should not think or brand anything old as a waste.
The foundation for all the new things in the present world was laid in the (g)olden days and what we are getting at present is all the updated / improvised ones of the old inventions which form the base of the new ones."

2663,"Probably the best game ever made for obvious reasons.
Not as unfiltered as CSGO but the graphics may get to you if you've never played older numbers."
2664,Counter işte. Bildiğimiz Counter.
2665,"Can something that you have been playing from your 4th birthday be bad?
No. And this game is sooo hearthwarming...
By looking at it, it is making nostalgia trip to your childhood:mechanics, voices, audio, physics and, that good old hl(GoldSrc) engine from other 2000s games. This game is timeless.You even get CS:CZ and CS:CZ Deleted Scenes, but...
...price
As kids we've been playing all these games by downloading them from pir@te sites...
For example:CS, hl, Far Cry, Wolfenstein, Serious Sam, CoD, Battlefield, Medal of Honor, Fallout...
And when we want to play older games from these and many other franchises-we need to pay 8.20€ :(
That is too much for games 16+ yrs old...
That is problem with all these fantastic games-high price. 
 I've bought CS 1.6 on sale(1.63€), good price, but for all older games from this franchises I've just listed fair price would be 2.50€... 
This also applies to CS:S as well, but since it's newer than games I gave example of, good price would be 4-5€.
This would just increase the income to VALVe(and other game studios) of these beautiful games which are abandoned   because of their stupid price. 
Way more people would buy them, because it's great feeling to play something from your early childhood for good price!
Big support for game devs who made our childhoods better!!!"

2829,"After all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that can't be ignored. No other shooter is as accessible, easy to play, simple nor skillful as this. It can be enjoyed anywhere with the 64MB portable version for LAN parties. It's all about aim, accuracy, quick reflexes but does have a strategical element since it is a tactical shooter and there's no respawning. This game was a major turning point in the history of FPS, and this game is what made online multiplayer competitive gaming so popular."

Based on the information provided, can you guess what game this review is for? What's it about? What kind of game is it?

Point is, these reviews are completely interchangeable. I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.

In my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.

Anyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?"

It was the first FPS game I've ever played. I played it for the first time in 2005 on my oldest steam account which I do not use anymore unfortunately.

Counter strike has really been a part of my life and a lot of experiences I have had with people on the different servers
I really miss a lot when you were a kid and you could just enjoy your free time when you had time off from school


I still enjoy playing counter strike 1.6 with a few friends at times"

3219,nice game
3220,"I think pretty much everyone has heard of this game. Be it because you played it yourself or because it was probably the victim of every killer game debate. ""Counter Strike"", often referred to as ""1.6"", is the cornerstone of this very successful game series that has helped shape the gaming landscape for years.

Gameplay
The principle of this classic should be clear to everyone: As a terrorist or anti-terrorist, we start the round, buy weapons and equipment and must now either eliminate the enemy team or fulfill the objective. Depending on the map, this can be setting/disarming a bomb or rescuing a hostage, whereby the latter is somewhat frowned upon among professional players. This allows you to earn money, which in turn unlocks better equipment.

Community
In the past, the game was probably a bit difficult, since you often met ""hardliners"" who could become quite insulting. However, since most of them have switched to ""Counter Strike: Global Offensive"", the atmosphere in the 1.6 version has become much more relaxed. Provided that you can still find players. Most of them have at least switched to the Source version.

Graphics/Sound
Do I have to say much about the graphics? It is very old and, since it was originally a mod of Half-Life, comparable to it. Soundtechnically also.

Conclusion
""Counter Strike 1.6"" is already very outdated, but still a good game. Nevertheless I would rather recommend Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Whoever, for whatever reason, doesn't feel like it, can still switch to the middle part, Counter Strike: Source."
3221,Very good game!

3691,"I have to say CS has been my go to game from my childhood.I have played this game in cafes and seen people playing this game as early as i can remember. This is one of the most remarkable games of its time and can easily beat even modern day games even today if it had a matchmaking system or adjusting your crosshair was easier ( basically making the configuration of the game easier for a newer player in modern times). This game is the soul of tactical shooter games and anyone can enjoy this. It is true what they say, it is the game which never dies...
Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with my friends, I will finally move on to CS:GO.
Counter Strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy. Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days without stoping. The huge weaponary option you can choose, the smoothness and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different
people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are
looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this...Great Game. GG WP.
And to all the people who will keep playing this game, all i can say, as always, GL & HF <3"
3692,da
3693,The game is still fire
3694,"cool

3695,"While not a bad game, Counter-strike 1.6 certainly did not age nearly as well as Source did. The FOV scaling that GoldSrc uses makes this game very difficult to play on a modern display, and from what I can tell there aren't really a whole lot of pure vanilla CS servers, unlike what Global Offensive has thanks to matchmaking. CS 1.6 is prettymuch only there for the mods at this point, in a similar way to CS Source, but with the added disadvantage that the outdated engine is not only less compatible with modern systems but also is less capable over all for custom gamemodes. Source is a lot better for custom maps and modes, as the engine limitations are far less strict and allow for much more creative tools. Source also has real physics, instead of the fake ones that were carried over from Half-Life (and technically Quake as well since they were used for dead body physics before ragdolls were a thing). This means better bhop and surf, alongside other custom gamemodes that take advantage of the Havok physics engine. Counter Strike Source also includes assets essential for certain Garry's Mod content to work properly, which alone in itself makes it more important than 1.6.

In conclusion, 1.6 is rendered completely obsolete by both Source and Global Offensive. Your only reason to purchase 1.6 is if you have friends who you really want to play it with, or if you are making/playing custom maps or mods made exclusively for it that were never ported to Source. From what I understand, 1.6 did have some other differences in gameplay mechanics that many veterans prefer over Global Offensive, but as a competitive shooter Global Offensive is more polished and more comfortable, especially now with the crosshair customization. If you want community mods, get CS Source or Garry's Mod. A lot of Source community gamemodes have even been ported to Global Offensive, so if you don't have money, you can play those for free."

I spent many many hours on this game growing up and I have now logged some (not a ton comparatively) hours on it as an adult.

I would still personally recommend playing the latest Counter Strike game (Global Offensive) for a large player base and quick matches but I was surprised how many people were still playing this game today when I jumped back in. I don't think you can go wrong with either experience!"

3833,"This game is older than half of the steam community users, love it."
3834,more realistic
3835,"There's a remaster-ish Counter-Strike you get together with this (or rather you get this together with that), but for the record: I prefer this one, the original.

Counter-Strike used to be my curse and my primary hobby. I have thousands upon thousands of hours spent in this game. So many nights... I had a dozen of Steam accounts created only to play CS on a (now dead) platform called PlayZeek, which was kind of what FaceIT is for CS:GO. This game represents my childhood and when I say CS all I think about is nostalgia.

CS's middlename is ESports, and it would not be an understatement if we would say that ESports wouldn't be today what it is, without this game. This game's ESports has died, obviously, but the game's community did not. Which is mindblowing. You don't have an issue finding a server with players at any given time, night or day. For a game so old it's wow. So if you're nostalgic and want to get back into this game, you won't have one problem, even after all this time. 

But for someone that has never played this before.. it is hard, it takes thousands of hours to learn the recoil and gameplay, has not aged well, looks ugly and the gameplay can probably only be understood and enjoyed by people that have understood and enjoyed it at its time. 

Going back to the game for a little bit of time was something unique. The feels, the nostalgia, the sounds, the gameplay, everything sends me back to my childhood, to a time without adult issues and only free time to waste (or spend) playing CS and dreaming of becoming the best. And expected to start the game, join a server, die instantly and then leave. But it actually made me play more. And I actually started to enjoy it. But I also understood the reasons why I would never come back to the game. What I have once seen as masterpiece, I now see as old gameplay. I still find it fun, to a point, I just can't see it with the same eyes I once did. 

This is a relic, a masterpiece for its time. To a point it can still be for most people that have used to play it at that time. I think updating the graphics to today standards, and maybe meddling a little bit with the gameplay, would make this game appeal to new people. The fact that this game has never died after sooooo many years, and it still has such an alive playerbase, says a lot. Normally I would suggest you play CS:GO instead of this, but I see them as totally different games, for probably different players. This one requires way more skill and it is way more punishing. What this game needs is the same gameplay and feel, but with today visuals. CS:CO (Classic Offensive) is more fitting to suggest here, but unfortunately, at the time writing this, it is still in development."

According to sources, What you said isn't good. Now, we established that what you just said is wrong. Let's get back to the topic, If you were right, it wouldn't make sense because you're not, imagine being a coconut, a coconut falls to the ground, right? So why won't your comment?

3973,"This game is one of legendary entertainment at the beginning 2000s. Amongst several Half-Life's offsprings created after the main game, this is the most successful one. As a multiplayer Half-Life-based game designed with own unique gameplay like Team Fortress and Day of Defeat, it had surprisingly become extremely popular amongst local area network gaming, which preceded internet gaming at the time, for several years. Its gameplay, character/weapon style, and rules just hit the spot and gained its popularity of which other fellow offsprings could not achieve."

loving the wallbangs ->>> you can rely on what you hear on many maps and just bang enemies through the wall ->>> so satisfying
loving the awp quick-/noscopes ->>> just press both mouse buttons at once = 100% hit chance on your invisible crosshair.

4140,"И нет сомнений, что диаграммы связей призывают нас к новым свершениям, которые, в свою очередь, должны быть ограничены исключительно образом мышления. Каждый из нас понимает очевидную вещь: разбавленное изрядной долей эмпатии, рациональное мышление говорит о возможностях первоочередных требований. Не следует, однако, забывать, что новая модель организационной деятельности играет определяющее значение для укрепления моральных ценностей. Имеется спорная точка зрения, гласящая примерно следующее: элементы политического процесса будут призваны к ответу. Каждый из нас понимает очевидную вещь: сложившаяся структура организации позволяет оценить значение своевременного выполнения сверхзадачи.

Каждый из нас понимает очевидную вещь: дальнейшее развитие различных форм деятельности в значительной степени обусловливает важность соответствующих условий активизации. Сложно сказать, почему базовые сценарии поведения пользователей преданы социально-демократической анафеме. Высокий уровень вовлечения представителей целевой аудитории является четким доказательством простого факта: укрепление и развитие внутренней структуры создаёт предпосылки для распределения внутренних резервов и ресурсов. Равным образом, сплочённость команды профессионалов выявляет срочную потребность прогресса профессионального сообщества.

Также как семантический разбор внешних противодействий предопределяет высокую востребованность существующих финансовых и административных условий! Не следует, однако, забывать, что граница обучения кадров не даёт нам иного выбора, кроме определения первоочередных требований. А ещё диаграммы связей смешаны с не уникальными данными до степени совершенной неузнаваемости, из-за чего возрастает их статус бесполезности. Предварительные выводы неутешительны: существующая теория создаёт предпосылки для новых предложений. Также как сплочённость команды профессионалов создаёт предпосылки для распределения внутренних резервов и ресурсов. Равным образом, понимание сути ресурсосберегающих технологий однозначно определяет каждого участника как способного принимать собственные решения касаемо направлений прогрессивного развития.

Банальные, но неопровержимые выводы, а также базовые сценарии поведения пользователей будут объединены в целые кластеры себе подобных. Каждый из нас понимает очевидную вещь: новая модель организационной деятельности требует определения и уточнения системы обучения кадров, соответствующей насущным потребностям. Являясь всего лишь частью общей картины, некоторые особенности внутренней политики формируют глобальную экономическую сеть и при этом - рассмотрены исключительно в разрезе маркетинговых и финансовых предпосылок. Ключевые особенности структуры проекта рассмотрены исключительно в разрезе маркетинговых и финансовых предпосылок.

Но постоянный количественный рост и сфера нашей активности влечет за собой процесс внедрения и модернизации распределения внутренних резервов и ресурсов. Но укрепление и развитие внутренней структуры выявляет срочную потребность вывода текущих активов. Повседневная практика показывает, что глубокий уровень погружения создаёт необходимость включения в производственный план целого ряда внеочередных мероприятий с учётом комплекса соответствующих условий активизации. А ещё представители современных социальных резервов объединены в целые кластеры себе подобных.

С учётом сложившейся международной обстановки, экономическая повестка сегодняшнего дня требует определения и уточнения форм воздействия. Внезапно, сделанные на базе интернет-аналитики выводы представляют собой не что иное, как квинтэссенцию победы маркетинга над разумом и должны быть объединены в целые кластеры себе подобных."

4156,"The year was 2000. Half-Life had already taken the world by storm and the prospect of modding the game was increasing in popularity. Counter-Strike was one of those mods. One of the most popular game modifications ever, Counter-Strike blended chunky weapons with rewarding team play, with the goal for counter-terrorists in most of the maps to either defuse a bomb, rescue hostages, escort a VIP to safety or prevent the terrorist team from escaping the area they're in. If you're on the terrorist team, however, the team goals are the opposite, naturally. One of the things that shines about Counter-Strike, though, is the amount of possibilities available. Don't feel like storming the enemy base guns-blazing? Why not sneak in via an air vent directly connecting to the room that the hostages are being contained in? Or perhaps you could draw your enemies out then snipe them from a distance? All the different ways you can win the match is ground-breaking. This, along with crisp, timeless graphics, a great selection of guns and the need for true teamwork, make Counter-Strike one of the best games of the decade.

Flash back to the first time I played the game was around 2007, when I was a kid. Elders told me the basic controls like movement and weapon toggling. Then they said something like:'' press O one B three one then move forward till you are taken down''. It brought me great fun back to that time even I did not realize much techniques. 
Later in a few years, I managed to build up my skills, attending some amateur games. Scenes can sometimes fly into my brain from that period of time.
Now I started my career, not much time available on CS. Every time I scan my library list, I saw the name, I saw the memories.

4227,"Similar to CS Source, I got this game on discount. Without a doubt, this is one of the best (if not the best, ahem CS:GO) Counter-Strike games out there. The gameplay is original and great. What threw me off from playing this game wa that most of the servers in the server browser contained viruses and that wallbanging was a thing (possibly due to hollow walls). There was also this 512 precache limit which would occasionally cause problems for modders. Yes, the graphics aren't that great with the GoldSrc engine but if the servers no longer contain viruses, I may come back to this game. Also, this version doesn't come with bots so you may need to get PODbot or something to compensate.

Auch wenn die Grafik und die Physik schon lange nicht mehr dem heutigen Level entsprechen, lohnt es sich denn noch CS 1.6 zu spielen. Hier kommt das richtige Shooter Feeling auf, man wird nicht von irgendwelchen hoch detaillierten Texturen oder Objekten abgeleckt, wie das in den heutigen FPS der Fall ist und den Gegner schwerer erkennbar macht. Hier kann sich komplett auf die Taktik und den Gegner konzentriert werden. Da Counter-Strike 1.6 meine ganze Jugend geprägt hat was gaming angeht, ist es und bleibt es mein lieblings PC-Game."

Even though I just bought it HERE, this is the first ever FPS game I played. It's also the main reason why I'm in love with the FPS genre to this day. Before buying this, I haven't played the game since 2013.

The moment when I first booted up CS 1.6 after purchasing it a few months ago, a tsunami of memories just came crashing in. This a childhood favorite of mine and in my eyes (Well, in most eyes actually), this is a masterpiece. No one can tell me otherwise.

I remembered goofing off in community servers with my friends in maps like fy_snow (My all time favorite map).
I also remember another map called ""Wall"" by Nipper. I would just load the map, and make it so the bots would only use knives and I would just try to get decent deag (Desert Eagle) one-taps.


It's great fun to this day even though the game is almost 21 years old. a total classic.

4334,"Over 2000 hours on this game and can say this game still holds up unlike most games.This game will always go down as one of the best.Playing community servers with admins is recommended because hackers are common but with server types as jailbreak or zombies or what ever modes gives you a little more to offer than the base game and is influential other games.Meet alot of really good people through communities.That i still talk to even after 10 or 15 years.
"
4335,"First time I ever played this game was when I was 8 or 9 , I had my first ever pc made then had a pirated copy of cs:cz and used to play the campaign with bots. I'm 20 now and playing this game again is like revisiting an old age home full of boomers sweating inside a 16v16 earrape radio command madhouse, not complaining but seeing a video game which was made before even you were born and still seeing dozens of server lists (more community Indian servers than csgo btw) , still beating and competing a lot of modern MP titles means a lot. 
This game is one of the few things which makes me regret being born in this generation."

4374,"I was played Counter Strike 1.6 bought on VALVE Steam Powered, I just download, maps which never was original as there is only Russia maps they all was modified, maps might be contained heavy virus against Microsoft using my game data I play they requested to download maps as only access to play on they servers otherwise there is no virus full severs or not original so they modified for they hack needs, that country called Russia and other countries similar like they must be banned from Internet as they exist as only hackers over internet so there is how it was looked like start menu even whole internet users don`t know how start menu works on Windows 10 that hacker who waited that I will be on Windows XP or something older just sent hack it was worked on Windows 10 so they still wait as well Windows 10 users as well, nothing was been found on Windows 10 I have installed for about half years whatever games I have played whatever I was download only Mario as Search engine found game to try it even it is hacked I wish to say no virus but not original 100% as it was been all of time next thing when I was playing CS 1.6 system was download they virus full maps, every game since I played before was not been pirated other they only wish that I never have some game by uTorrent, Search Engine like Google, they was not been able to split virus on me anymore, but even these severs are full of not original players, they are hackers as well who create virus for even Windows 10 year 2015 version, after restarting some of hacks was show up as all URL game losing like any original game I was download was nut usable as shortcut it was just blank time I speak, file formats after deleting game was been suspicious with formats like , they was been after all original files of game was been deleted 
*.scr*.dem*.hpk*.cfg*.gam*.wad*.dt*.tga*.bsp*.res*.mdl*.png*.wav*.spr*.css*.vdf they was been after all original files of game was been deleted, so to reduce performance losing by antivirus we can add these as most dangerous by hackers if someone ever download last times something from them as they use these formats to brake computer, colors in old profile I went in was go from red to quad all picture I was take even video that there is black quad just by mostly Russian hackers all was in they language only and Russia servers as CS 1.6 gaming list as well, very rare someone else country, icons background was go black as well for about 300 milliseconds, since I was created new Windows 10 account hacks was gone, when I turn back there on old account hack something virus better saying was not anymore in there they was disabled logs some of logs settings since I was open them they only was started to work as well as well when I was re-installed drivers virus as well can be called hack was been in driver in installation I have all was happen when I was re-install driver so drivers was they target this time to be infected, infections was using Program Files drivers I was used by infecting them they hackers over internet was tried to disable my shell in hopes I use Windows XP, or something what won`t have protection, however I was turn back mostly all settings without audit settings, to see did d*mb one hacker will understand he was not get he need thing to destroy Windows 10 protection but he was not I was just filmed it for evidence, like reducing anti-virus used performance like scanning only hacker used files in case of decays they not use these formats like *.jpg, *.txt etc. by just scanning only .*exe or known targets as mostly *.dll, it will reduce CPU usage from 70%-30% even as well of course much more, RAM something like 1GB to 200MB, as well every game after visiting Counter Strike 1.6 severs, was working seriously slow I just decide to uninstall all games after all I understand that meanwhile I was played Russia hackers never arrested like Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko mysteries, where Ukraine Billion of Billons was gone to Russia as rebel meanwhile he`s body guards was take billions at least 20-50 as I was read on news at time he was done country heist, he is hiding against Ukraine country and is still never arrested in Russia that was been ever criminal Russia police was wait his stolen money with most happiness in they country as thousands of hackers is living in Russia even might be millions I can just guess as in they country never have truth specially by they government services who actually steal good businessman money in Russia saying we are saving our people meanwhile they just do heist after heist to prove that money ever exist they need Banks who might be in stage of bankrupt without Russia or North Korea, but actually bankrupt is to poorest countries like Moldova, they was Bankrupt straight in Banks called offshore counties as they are called by FBI workers when I read news so not country offshore. Mostly all these hackers even won`t have original account picture that mean even they won`t buy CS 1.6 they hack people computers by just never using original maps and allow to download they viruses, what of course I don`t think is VALVE fault. This game just can prove that even hackers most likely Russians, there is almost only Russian servers available won`t wait someone gamers like using MS-DOS, Windows XP these mod servers wait as well Windows 10 clients like me to use hacks on they computers like my so choice is players only to never play with someone who made these moded servers etc. My computer was got ill by this game server downloads, every setting was tried to be disabled I was need to make new Windows profile to fix it I don`t know how they done it but only thing is that they try to paralyses any Windows settings exists any software works as well like start menu, any security settings like event log records they was paralyzed as well Windows defender on Windows 10 now I was fix it by opening all settings from new any re-opened software these hackers paralyzed is fixed by me, as well I can see black background behind any Windows icon only by these never original made hack/virus servers, as well from nowhere was show up customer support why then even I was turned off all background Windows 10 App`s from nowhere after playing CS 1.6 servers from they mods shows up months ago turned off app. I will be glad to play original CS 1.6 servers not hacker will to destroy computers. Mods mod and almost every sever mods, even there is no smallest information about guns used in game like accuracy, bullets shoot per second, damage by weapon, magazine size, range shooting with these guns is not like original in original maps and even then everyone make themselves mods, like they damage by gun 1000 maybe some have, game have low protection from modifications, Deathmatch is only mode in there, no real guns total final fantasy game that you are shoot down and re spawn to be shoot down again in same place, I personally allow play this till 5 years not anymore they can fantasy like this game modification makers, of servers are only mod modification game expansion mod which is CS 1.6 to Half-Life engine called 3D gold engine, try game After life on Android full graphics 100% better than zombie mode even Call of duty mobile in celebration event is 100 times better even graphic maybe 1000% Android have better than this game, with honor these hacker severs opens only when they can play only.

Unlike most people, I played the Henry Stickmin Collection with no prior experience with any of the flash games that make up this series. I have never once played one of these games, and my only real exposure to it was watching a YouTuber I like play ""Stealing the Diamond"" about three years ago. So, I don't have any nostalgia tinted goggles influencing me here.

So, what do I think? The Henry Stickmin Collection is incredible. These games are so much fun, they're wacky, and they make choice based elements and quick time events, two gameplay elements that are usually shoehorned into games as cheap gimmicks, actually fun. And that's all the gameplay that there is!

There are 6 main stories that you go through here. They start off shorter, and get progressively more involved with each entry. If I had to choose one as my favorite, it would definitely be Completing the Mission, which is the last game in the Collection, made exclusively for it, and by far the largest and most passionately created.

There are a ton of achievements, 82 in all, which aren't super challenging to do, but take time, and are random and fun. Bios, information about the random characters, are collectibles that you receive for right-clicking on each character that you come into contact with. I personally enjoyed this aspect of the game, as I like collectibles, and found the bio descriptions hilarious and full of humorous references (which describes the game as a whole.

The only bad thing I have to say about this game would be the bugs. First of all, the game, by default, plays in small window. You can turn on fullscreen, but when you do, you get a warning message that this makes the game unstable, and prone to freezing and crashing. I can confirm that this is definitely the case, as I had my game crash about once every 20 minutes. It's not that big a deal, as you can just restart it, and you don't lose progress, but it's very annoying. That's the most important thing that the developers absolutely NEED to fix!

Second, there are times in the animation where the frame rate just plummets for a couple of seconds for no reason. It's not always in the same spot either, because if you come back later and replay that scene, it will work fine. It appears to just be poor optimization, and should also be addressed.

Other than that, I can't say anything bad about this game. I absolutely loved it, and I think fans of this series, or people who like quirky indie games in general, will get a lot of enjoyment out of this!

I personally don't think $15 is too high a price for this game, as it really is a quality game. Some people seem to think that if you don't get a certain number of hours of entertainment out of a game, that it isn't worth the money. I don't necessarily agree, because I think shorter titles that maintain a high and consistent quality experience for 10 hours are far more worth the money than one where half of the gameplay is busy work for 40 hours. Regardless, if you don't think 10 hours of gameplay is enough to warrant a $15 purchase, then I'd recommend you wait for a sale. I can easily see this going for $5 during a holiday sale.

I hope you found this review helpful! Please leave me a rating, and give me your thoughts in the comments, as I would love to hear feedback, ideas, and what personal experiences you've had with this title.

4520,Still one of the coolest games I get back to!
4521,A really good classic shooting game online
4522,"The one that started it all. Amazing game. Despite this game being over 20 years old and there being a slew of other CS games, 1.6 is still definitely worth playing. Unlike the other Goldsrc mods, this one has aged exceptionally well and you can still find thousands of people playing at all times."

4597,A true classic.
4598,Good Game
4599,nice game =D
4600,Less raging in cs1.6 than in CSGO because in 1.6 there are no competitive MM and other matches that do not have admins to check for cheaters. VAC isn't helping CSGO players. In CSGO there is almost no way to tell if someone is a cheater or a good player (because there are so many cheaters nowadays and VAC doesn't ban them the second it detects cheats so cheaters get banned later when they ruin fun for hundreds or even thousands of people). Basically CS 1.6 is more fun to play nowadays.
4601,yes
4602,"Ah, the game the started my addiction to CS... Good times."
4603,Best game
4604,nostalgia
4605,Back when Valve actually made games instead of just profiting from passive income
4606,"Old school cs game, way better and more fun than cs go."
4607,"people who like FPS games and are inexperienced should definitely play, kids of age 12-14 definitely would love this."
4608,FUCKING LIT
4609,this will always be the best CS game EVER and will ALWAYS be my all time favorite game i have ever played.. just look at how many hours i put into this game back in the day. i still have yet to play the newer CS but i plan on getting around 2 it. if you  have never played this one tho i HIGHLY recommend getting it. its still so much fun to this day even tho its 21 years old. also reminds me that im starting 2 get old lol
4610,"Awesome Game, non-comparable <3"
4611,YES ...
4612,This game is very nice and the gameplay is old but still gold!!
4613,I played the game when i was 9 and i recently purchased it for my new account i love it so far

4627,good game
4628,A pile of stinky shit is better than this fucking Ass game
4629,"The best game ever, enough said."
4630,"The only other contenders in the FPS genre that could give 1.6 a run for its money at its time would've been Quake2 and WolfET.
What it lacks though is a class system which would've bolstered teamplay further. 

A simple concept and by borrowing the robust design of HL; what started of as a side project for Valve has endured the test of time and come to its own to be regarded as the father of all modern tactical FPS games. A pixel gem for the generations.

Having a robust game design complemented with an equivalent anti-cheat system would have labelled this game to perfection. Unfortunately that is not the case even with its successor CSGO. 

Nevertheless it's growth is unparalleled and is responsible for what the esports industry has become today. 

Would definitely recommend especially if you have 10 friends over for a lan party and the year is 2008! Great times  indeed!"
4631,good ol' times...
4632,👍

This game gives you lot of opportunities to play. There are lot of game mods, fun servers and even more!

I starts playing this game as a NonSteam player in 2011 and as a Steam Player in 2012.

This game make my life more better! My first programming experience was with this game. As a Pawner. And now programming is my fulltime job.

Thanks Valve for amazing ChildHood and lot of beutiful memories!"

The gameplay is just timeless and there's a reason people are still playing basically the same game now in 2021 and it's still amongst the most popular games in the world!

My only criticism of this version is that it doesn't come with bots, but it was a bit new for that to be included just yet I think.

4975,"Sounding is the act of inserting a metal rod into your urethra. Sounding tubes are meant to be used medically, but some people figured out that they experience se*ual pleasure from the act. The reason for this being that the sounding tube can reach very sensitive parts inside your pen1s that, if stimulated, can create some very intense orgasms."
4976,good game
4977,"Counter-Strike has been my favorite game and stress reliever since i started playing in 1999. I checked the box that asked did i get it free because at the time when i started playing it was an add-on to the original game Half-Life, i believe the Version was Beta 6? This game was incredible until the hacks were created ... and now no-one recognizes the movements and impossibilities of shots from incredible angles and through walls,and around corners, and across maps ..well if youve ever played..you know what i mean."

5011,"I must say that this game, for all of its age, has a very solid movemen and shooting mechanics. Compared to the previous titles, perhaps the recoil is a bit stronger, but that can be compensated for with a bit of practice.

Otherwise, a very solid game, would definitely reccomend. The only problems that I have with the Steam version is that you can't create a private server and play with bots, and you can't adjust the size of the crosshair.

Anyways, worth your money, but I'd buy it via a Valve bundle over a steam sale."

This is one of the most remarkable games of its time and can easily beat even modern day games even today if it had a matchmaking system or adjusting your crosshair was easier ( basically making the configuration of the game easier for a newer player in modern times). This game is the soul of tactical shooter games and anyone can enjoy this. It is true what they say, it is the game which never dies."

5106,"I love the level design of this game. Every map gives you it's own feeling, which you can bond with yours. There used to be a singleplayer mode against bots (you can enable them again, there are guides in the community hub about that). The bots AI is really cute, they can follow you around, be sneaky-beaky like you, respond to your radio messages and even camp with you!
Also, you must know that there is a free level-editor in Steam for games like hl or cs (Half-Life SDK) if you wanna to just try it out. It's really fast-easy to use and there's a lot of tutorials on the internet.

The game still has a solid playerbase, with good numbers in official-esque public servers, so I will highly recommend trying it out. 

For all the personel involved in making Counter-Strike, thank you, thank you, thank you so much! And a shout-out for those whoms this game was a life-changing experience, mad respect!

PD: Valve you need to add point-shop items for this game, please!"

Counter-Strike, the popular online action game and first-person shooter for the PC.

Gameplay

I bought it and played it online for years. The 1.6 version is by far the best in terms of playability. When they released Counterstrike Source they traded a lot of the game play for better graphics. It's a very old game by todays standards but if, like me, you've got quite an old PC which won't play a lot of the newer games, and you want to play in real time against other real players not bots then this is the game for you. If you've never played it then here's a brief run down of what the game is about. You first decide which team you're going to play for terrorist or counter terrorist. You then equip your player with a weapon, secondary weapon, ammo, grenades, kevlar etc. Then depending on what type of map it is you have an objective if you're playing a defuse map then you need to plant a bomb and let it blow up (terrorist) or defuse the bomb (Counter Terrorist). Hostage map stop the CT's rescuing Hostages (terrorist) Rescue Hostages (Counter Terrorists) on any map there is another objective -destroy the other team. The first team to complete an objective wins the round. Depending on which server you play on there are loads and loads of variations in maps, objectives, round times etc. Some servers have custom maps with no gravity, pistols only, knives only etc. etc. etc. The game really is vast and there are still many of players worldwide who play this game.

5190,"This game make me angry ,sad ,happy ,confused, surprise. but most important thing,,, it have given me some friends and memories which i will remember till my end."
5191,"Counter Strike, The most popular first person shootout game in the world. It could easily be said that over 2 million people are actually playing this game at this very moment while you are reading this post. The game actually evolves from the old game known as quack which was low on graphics but was one of the most addictive games of its time. The game has had many improvements to it since then, in the beginning counter strike was not known to many and it was not till counter strike 1.5 that people actually got really into this game. The next version which was the condition zero was even a better version of the previous 1.5 but then 1.6 really changed the things around and it set the standards to playing counter strike in the big leagues. The next version which was the counter strike source had a completely new engine to it and so many liked it but most didn’t, actually it more about what a player prefers I can play counter strike 1.6 but if someone asks me to play source I still would play because they equally are fun to play but again its preference based. The next revolution I may say in counter strike is the counter strike global offence which has both a touch of 1.6 and source. So counter strike global offence is the new thing in the counter strike world and it has been said to be the standard game used worldwide for the big leagues such as WCG.

 

So, What exactly is the game about well its really easy to understand there are two teams, one being the good team (Counter Terrorists) and one being the bad team (Terrorists). The object of the Counter Terrorists could be to disarm a bomb save the hostages or keep a VIP safe, this varies according to the map, but in most cases it’s very likely that the Counter terrorists would have to defuse a bomb. As for the Terrorist I think it is really clear these guys have to plant the bomb, kill the VIP, or stay on guard for the hostages but most likely these bad boys would have to plant the bomb and try to kill all of the counter terrorists or blast the bomb.
The game play of counter strike is very unique and looks really good this first person shootout game gets a person so involved that people literally get glued to their screens. All the guns have a unique sound and a unique style of firing. Apart from the guns to make the game more interesting there are a lot of other equipments that a person can use to his advantage in a game such as the he-grenade, smoke grenade, flash grenade. The he grenade can be used as a hand grenade and is very effective if used right can kill the whole team. The smoke grenade is usually used when there is a sniper up ahead so that he has difficulty aiming and last but not the least the flash grenade can be used in a very effective way as it blinds the person it’s thrown at.

 

Counter strike is more than just a game as it even helps you to buildup communication skills. When playing in a team it is very likely that there would be a plan which needs to be executed in each round, called out by the leader, so it really helps in develop skills such as listening and obeying, working in a team, helping those in trouble and always going for the win.

 

Although counter strike has evolved very much from its previous versions and has improved over the ages but no matter which version people play they never get disappointed. In today’s world it is said that if you really want to develop a first person shootout game it should at least meet the standards of counter strike."

5198,"This is one of the oldest FPS game I (or infact we) have played. Be it the thumping sounds of model boots or cracking sounds of nades, this game never gets old. We have a lot of new FPS competitive multiplayer games now but you just cant ignore the nostalgia that CS offers.

We may move forward with more graphic intensive and indulging games in our lives but we must not forget our roots and this game is the root that helped us move where we are now.

Salute to this legend."

5217,"Well for one it's cool to see where CS began all these years ago. 
And for two you get this game along with CS:CZ for $10, and you cannot buy them seperatly if I'm not mistaken, so in other words CZ is the best out of 1.6, CZ and Source. And so if you're on the fence about buying this one or Source, go with this one. 

ANd if you really need to know what counterstrike is just look it up. Biggest game on steam."

5262,"CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best

game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.

It starts off with a team trying to kill another team.

I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.

Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.

When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.

CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.

Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.

In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6)."

Don't let my 8 hours fool you, that's only on the Steam version. I've played this game for hundreds of hours and I don't regret any of it. I've never been good at this game but I know that I can join a random server and have fun. Thank you CS 1.6 for these amazing memories and thank you NIPPER for the amazing maps me and my friend played."

5432,its like csgo.. but older
5433,"NEVER FORGET!  This is the game (mod) that started it all!  While it's been years since I've actually played this game, I feel compelled to write a review for it out of sheer appreciation for what it brought the gaming community.  

""Bunny-hopping"" - yep, also a product of CS.  People used the method to damn near float across the screen at rapid speed, making it hard as hell to hit you.  They'd find ways to kill bunny-hopping, but people found ways to do it anyway.

Counter-Strike was one of the first popular online multiplayer games, and it debuted as a mod for Half-Life 2 (also a GREAT game).  At the time, as long as you owned HL2, you could download Counter-Strike (CS) free of charge.  This was PRE-steam.  It was also one of the first FPS games that really took advantage of the new ""broadband age"".  Up until this point, FPS games had been shoddy at best with regards to connection speed and ping.  CS was one of the first FPS games that you could play against a buddy, and the experience was as fluid as if you were playing an AI game.... I can't stress enough how much broadband made smooth FPS gaming possible.  And in a weird way, that's part of the story of the success of CS - aside from it being an awesome game.  It inception came at the right place, at the right time.  

CS went through many many iterations and releases.  With each new release, came new maps, new weapons, and/or slight changes which made immediate effect on the game.  I recall when they removed the reticle from the AWP when unzoomed.... It changed the field completely!  No longer were people able to use a bolt action sniper rifle to shoot from the hip and head shot you!  And then there was the time that they dropped an update, and when we loaded the game up, what were we surprised with?.... DUAL BERETTA PISTOLS!  

If I recall, the last version to be released before steam was version 1.6, and with 1.7, came the release of the Steam client, originally used to keep the mod up to date.  I still remember thinking upon 1.7's release.... ""What the hell do we need this bloated addition for?""  Nobody - I'm sure not even Valve - knew what it was going to become - the biggest gaming streaming/management platform on the internet today.

CS is a game that had a certain magic to it.  Sorta like TF2 - in it's original form - before it was, you know.... crap.  It was often imitated, but never duplicated.  I'd say they did a good job with CS: Go, it's about as close as you can get to that original CS ""feel"".  There was just something about that original HL2 engine with those original models and maps that made the game sharp.  It's hard to put it any other way.

I've long since moved on to other games, but Counter-Strike will always hold a special place in my heart as the game that helped bring FPS games to the internet."

5482,"Gaben can't grab my wallet here, epic 10/10"
5483,This game will live forever
5484,"This is the absolute best Esport FPS ever created and I will tell you why and disprove any points you might have against it objectively. 
This game has surely standed the test of time, as 8888 says ""Even after 20 years this game is a masterpiece and is the king of competitive FPS. Overwatch, Valorant and others can only dream to even come close."" 

I absolutely agree with this as yeah sure, the graphics are extremely outdated however when we talk about game play and movement although a little lacking and hit reg it's extremely hard to compete and even the worst quality of the game being it's graphics is secretly one of the best thing about the game as almost anyone on any pc can run the game an ok modern pc can easily get hundreds of frames per second, hell even out dated pc's can do the same. Which in turn makes the game super responsive and just so much better than more modern competitive shooters as it makes the gateway of entry into Esports attainable to anyone who only needs a good internet connection. 

The game's amazing hit detection and lag compensation have still not been bested by any other game. Due to just how simple the game is and how fast any pc can run the game it's nearly impossible to compete to. Sadly the model animation interpolation is a little lacking however, I and most others are literally able to get a thousand frames per second, so yeah it runs really freaking smooth and lets players really flex their reaction times and just generally increases the skill ceiling drastically. 

A lot of people nag on the game for simple game-play mechanics and so on however through simple rules complex strategies can be formed making that point irrelevant. That is why I will state with absolute confidence that this is the fairest most competitive Electronic sport on the market. Its fairness comes about with it being extremely fair to both teams [(CT) and (T)] and switches their spawns at half (15/30) , just in case the map is (sided). Which coupled with everything else said, makes this sadly even better than the successor CS S and even CSGO, however sadly most the player base has moved to the newest game which does support better graphics and so on that does slightly diminish the quality of performance However the game runs quite well still and Is only extremely slightly less competitive. 

However the difference is so mynute that even myself has moved onto CSGO as that's where the tournaments and everything else are. Which sadly do indeed raise skill ceilings more as they promote more game-play and competition. However make no mistake game-play wise and minus all the Eye candy that CSGO and other games have you can't beat a game made and optimized for slower pc's 20 years ago as it does allow for a higher skill ceiling. With all that being said this game is a relic of the past and CSGO is Constantly getting better for Higher skill ceilings and at the moment CSGO is right under CS 1.6 and with newer and faster pc's being built every mouth soon CS 1.6 will lose the competitive edge that made it better than CSGO and CSGO will soon Become the game with a higher skill ceiling...

 Nah just kidding better pcs just make the easy-er game to run even faster compared to CSGO lol CS 1.6 better 10/10"
5485,I can play fortnite on it so it is very epic
5486,best fps game ever made!
5487,"This is one of the best Fps games ever made, anyone can play this masterpiece, even on the weakest computer you can play.  It is not as popular as it used to be, but there are still people who play this game today.  If you have 1 euro or any value on steam, and wait for summer sale or winter sale.  Buy this game.  10/10."

This was my childhood, chilling on TeamSpeak, playing cs 1.6 on a friday night with my friends. This was the GOTY for many years, the large ammount of game modes, the ammount of servers being hosted and the still active community is just it. This was the shit for pretty much everyone who plays FPS games."

5691,"This game saved my life.

I am 28.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

If you're a long time player of CS 1.6, then you will definitely have a treat in playing this game since you can mod it and do many MANY things with it. There really isn't much to say about CS 1.6 since no matter how much we praise it, all the positive reviews and comments won't amount to how much great this game is. Over all, it's a good game, getting the bots will need some file managing but the hard work of modding the game will 100% be worth it."

5982,"DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS OR CONDITION ZERO AS THEY ARE NOT SUPPORTED AND WILL NOT EVEN OPEN!
I bought this as part of Counter Strike Complete as I wanted to play CS Condition Zero (Complete includes CS, CS Condition Zero and CS Source).
Both CS and CS CZ will not even open and run after lots of searching and trying to report a fault it became evident that STEAM DO NOT SUPPORT CS OR CS CZ.
I played CS Source on the day of purchase for a several hours which seems to play without any problems for me on Linux Steam.
Tried on the following day to get vanilla CS and CS CZ running to no avail and unable to get support from Steam, after searching online it became evident that nobody is supporting vanilla CS or CS CZ.
This begs the question why steam are selling a product which doesn't work and that they offer no support for (and neither does anyone else).
To make matters worse, when I requested a refund less than 24 after purchasing the CS Complete pack I received and email stating that as I played the purchase for more than 2 hours that my request for a refund was refused (well in fairness I had played a third of it for more than 2 hours as two thirds of the pack does not work at all).
If CS and CS CZ doesn't work then for pity sake steam, STOP SELLING IT - THIS MAKES YOU LOOK QUESTIONABLE TO SAY THE LEAST.
MY ADVICE IS BY ALL MEANS BUY CS SOURCE IF THAT IS YOUR THING BUT TO STAY WELL AWAY FROM ANY CS PACK WHICH CONTAINS NON SOURCE ELEMENTS."

With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

6077,"Obviously, the most iconic FPS ever. Everyone and their brother played this game. I first played this in 2010 at the age of 5 with my uncle (who was 17) and I loved playing it. I always had my on and off periods with 1.6, since my mom wasn't fond of shooters. I think everyone who hasn't played 1.6 should play it.

Today playing it, it's not that great though. It has not aged that well at all. But it's always a blast from the past to play this game."
6078,Old school <3

6089,"По всем известным законам
авиации,

  
нет никакой пчелы
должен уметь летать.

  
Его крылья слишком малы, чтобы достать
его толстое тельце оторвалось от земли.

  
Пчела, конечно, все равно летает

  
потому что пчёлам плевать
то, что люди думают, невозможно.

  
Желтый, черный. Желтый, черный.
Желтый, черный. Желтый, черный.

  
Ой, черный и желтый!
Давайте немного встряхнем.

  
Барри! Завтрак готов!

  
Ооминг!

  
Подожди секунду.

  
Привет?

  
- Барри?
- Адам?

  
- Вы верите, что это происходит?
- Не могу. Я заберу тебя.

  
Выглядящий острым.

  
Используйте лестницу. Твой отец
заплатили хорошие деньги за тех.

  
Извини. Я взволнован.

  
Вот выпускник.
Мы очень гордимся тобой, сынок.

  
Идеальный табель успеваемости, все четверки.

  
Очень гордиться.

  
Ма! У меня тут кое-что происходит.

  
- У тебя ворсинки на пухе.
- Ой! Это я!

  
- Помаши нам! Мы будем в ряду 118 000.
- До свидания!

  
Барри, я же сказал тебе,
перестань летать в дом!

  
- Привет, Адам.
- Привет, Барри.

  
- Это пушистый гель?
- Маленький. Особый день, выпускной.

  
Никогда не думал, что у меня это получится.

  
Трехдневная начальная школа,
трехдневная средняя школа.

  
Это было неудобно.

  
Трехдневный колледж. Я рад что взял
день и путешествовал автостопом по улью.

  
Вы вернулись другим.

  
- Привет, Барри.
- Арти, отращиваешь усы? Выглядит хорошо.

  
- Слышишь о Фрэнки?
- Да.

  
- Ты идешь на похороны?
- Нет, я не собираюсь.

  
Каждый знает,
ужалишь кого-нибудь, умрешь.

  
Не тратьте его на белку.
Такая горячая голова.

  
Я думаю, он мог бы
просто ушел с дороги.

  
Мне нравится это включение
парк развлечений в наши дни.

  
Вот почему нам не нужны каникулы.

  
Парень, немного пышности ...
в сложившейся ситуации.

  
- Что ж, Адам, сегодня мы мужчины.
- Мы!

  
- Пчеловоды.
- Аминь!

  
Аллилуйя!

  
Студенты, преподаватели, заслуженные пчелы,

  
пожалуйста, поприветствуйте Дина Баззуэлла.

  
Добро пожаловать, New Hive Oity
выпускной класс ...

  
... 9:15.

  
На этом наши церемонии завершаются.

  
И начинается твоя карьера
в Honex Industries!

  
Выберем ли мы свою работу сегодня?

  
Я слышал, это просто ориентация.

  
Берегись! Вот так.

  
Держите руки и антенны
внутри трамвая всегда.

  
- Интересно, на что это будет похоже?
- Немного страшно.

  
Добро пожаловать в Honex,
подразделение Honesco

  
и часть Hexagon Group.

  
Это оно!

  
Вау.

  
Вау.

  
Мы знаем, что ты, как пчела,
проработал всю свою жизнь

  
чтобы добраться до точки, где вы
может работать всю жизнь.

  
Мед начинается, когда наша доблестная пыльца
Качки приносят нектар в улей.

  
Наша сверхсекретная формула

  
автоматически корректируется цвет,
с поправкой на аромат и контуром пузыря

  
в этот успокаивающий сладкий сироп

  
с его отличительной
золотое сияние вы знаете как ...

  
Медовый!

  
- Эта девушка была горячей.
- Она моя двоюродная сестра!

  
- Она?
- Да, мы все кузены.

  
- Правильно. Ты прав.
- В Honex мы постоянно стремимся

  
улучшить каждый аспект
существования пчел.

  
Эти пчелы проходят стресс-тестирование
новая технология шлемов.

  
- Как вы думаете, что он делает?
- Недостаточно.

  
Здесь у нас есть последнее достижение,
Крельман.

  
- Что это значит?
- Овсянка, немного меда

  
что зависает после того, как вы его залите.
Спасает нам миллионы.

  
Кто-нибудь работает над Кельманом?

  
Конечно. Большинство пчелиных работ
маленькие. Но пчелы знают

  
что каждая небольшая работа,
если все сделано хорошо, значит очень много.

  
Но выбирайте внимательно

  
потому что ты останешься на работе
вы выбираете на всю оставшуюся жизнь.

  
На той же работе всю оставшуюся жизнь?
Я этого не знал.

  
Какая разница?

  
Вы будете рады узнать, что пчелы,
как вид, не имел ни одного выходного дня

  
через 27 миллионов лет.

  
Значит, ты просто будешь работать с нами до смерти?

  
Мы обязательно попробуем.

  
Ух ты! Это взорвало мой разум!

  
""Какая разница?""
Как ты вообще такое мог сказать?

  
Одна работа навсегда?
Это безумный выбор.

  
Я рад. Теперь у нас есть только
принять одно решение в жизни.

  
Но, Адам, как они могли
никогда не говорили нам об этом?

  
Зачем вам что-то ставить под сомнение?
Мы пчелы.

  
Мы самые совершенные
функционирующее общество на Земле.

  
Вы когда-нибудь думали, может быть, что-то
работать здесь слишком хорошо?

  
Как, например? Приведите мне один пример.

  
Я не знаю. Но ты знаешь
о чем я говорю.

  
Пожалуйста, расчистите ворота.
Королевская сила нектара на подходе.

  
Подожди секунду. Проверьте это.

  
- Эй, это же Пыльца Качки!
- Вау.

  
Я никогда не видел их так близко.

  
Они знают, на что это похоже
вне улья.

  
Да, но некоторые не возвращаются.

  
- Привет, качки!
- Привет, Джоксы!

  
Ребята, вы молодцы!

  
Вы монстры!
Вы небесные уроды! Я люблю это! Я люблю это!

  
- Интересно, где они были.
- Я не знаю.

  
Их день не запланирован.

  
За пределами улья летает кто знает
где, черт знает что.

  
Вы не можете просто решить быть пыльцой
Джок. Для этого нужно быть воспитанным.

  
Правильно.

  
Смотреть. Это больше пыльцы
чем мы с вами увидим в жизни.

  
Это просто символ статуса.
Пчелы зарабатывают на этом слишком много.

  
Возможно. Если ты не носишь это
и дамы увидят тебя"

I have to write it a huge positive review, tho.
Mostly because it's a grandad of MP games.
So many developers tried to just replicate it.
Such a great teamwork game, truly perfect.
This right here is a piece of gaming history.
It's a classic, just like that original Half-Life.
And it definitely deserves a positive review.

6259,"Do you want to experience an old but classical game? Will this be the first time playing CS 1.6? Are you looking forward to NOT join a community of angry Russian players? If your answer is yes to all of these questions, then nope, go and buy another game, ANY other game will do, because you will grow to hate CS 1.6. 

Oh, not because it's a bad game per say, but you will play against people with about 15-20 years of experience, meaning you will die, die and of course die. Sure you can push on through for some months to get those skills as this game is very dexterity orientated, but the question is, will it be worth it? 

Well, only you can decide if you are masochistic enough, and no. Playing against badly programmed bots will only give you so much enjoyment before it gets dull. Furthermore it will NOT give you enough experience to stand your ground against real players once you have built up your confidence.

However, If this ISN'T your first time playing CS 1.6 then what are you waiting for? Buy it right now because it is just as fun as you remember it!!! But I don't have to tell you this, do I?

TL:DR An old school skill based shooter with an EXTRMELY unfriendly learning curve inside a very cancerous community. However, if you find this review triggering, then this is your kind of game and you should go and own some noobs, because this game is gold.~"

 This is the beginning of the life of countless young FPS games, and it is also the childhood in the hearts of countless people. It has been popular all over the world and is a model of the game industry that is imitated and even copied by subsequent games.  This game has been destined to be extraordinary since it was released. Countless servers have been turned on and off, and countless modules have been made and updated. Today it is still alive, living in an abandoned USB flash drive, living in someone’s memory  Here, live the word of mouth from old players to new players.
 Ten years ago, that ignorant boy first met with it, so he was fortunate enough to travel to every quiet corner of the desert and hear the melodious sound of Italian street corners. Ten years later, his school uniform was changed into a suit, and the years climbed up to his face, but when he double-clicked the black and white icon and returned here, he was still the brave boy back then.
 And it will never change.

 An eternal monument should not be judged."

6395,"Are you old?  I know I am.  Think 1.6 is for boomers?  Try playing it; with a community of very little cheaters, you and your ""legendary eagle"" clan of togglers will have a great time being embarrassed by one of the most difficult first person shooters of the last 20 years.

Fast game play, complex dynamics, challenging recoil and difficult to master aim.  If you want a challenge from CS GO, 1.6 is for you.

Although if you downloaded your skill in CS: GO, you will be humiliated by the boomers in 1.6.  If this is something that will trigger you, you should probably get your pacifier out and try playing checkers with your other triggered friends.

Try it out @ topfrag.com

Boomers are waiting to embarrass you.

There were times in my life, 1.6. was my life. As an aspiring progamer in 1.6. I spent endless hours in this game and did even found a special grenade trick on inferno that is unique until today and no other pro gamer found it. Something that I'm kinda proud of haha. The maps creators of the standard maps must have been geniuses, because the way the maps where played over the years changed and you did find things out about a map even after years of intense study. That's some kind of a philosophical thought, but it's actually true. The concept today in CS is very different and that is the reason why I dont play CS (except for 1.6) anymore."

6513,"[h1][b]It was a long, long, journey with Counter-Strike.[/b][/h1]

It was one the games I played in my childhood, all the way back in around 2010-2012 when my dad had a laptop which had Non-Steam CS 1.6 (which was technically Condition Zero). I loved messing around with it, even going as far as making custom bots and applying mods I found from GameBanana.

This game made me a part of the CS community. Remember that CS 1.6 MOTD? The one that shows a URL to [url=counter-strike.net]counter-strike.net[/url], which is now where Valve posts updates to CS:GO. And it was thanks to this link that I found CS:GO, though I was never that good at it at all.

And even though I am dedicated to getting better in CS:GO, I just love playing with these guys known as [b]bots[/b]. All the way back from CS 1.6 when Ping of Death was a thing. [spoiler]I'm now using ReGameDLL instead [/spoiler]

Long story short, I found a FPS with 1999-style graphics that played [b]AMAZING[/b], and it led me into one of the oldest FPS gaming communities of all time.

It's a classic that I've been playing for more than 20 years (outside Steam) and I still enjoy it.

6633,"Counter-Strike v1.6 - the first ever Counter-Strike game based on the original half-life mod. Today's FPS games are so customizable, i can't tell the difference between pay-to-win and play-to-win. Counter-Strike always impresses me with the linear Action/FPS experience - you are playing to win a match and SKILL is the only VARIANT. play this game if you like Action/FPS, but also play this game because of its linear approach to competition. - deokumar gandharry"

6648,"The classic counter strike my first game on steam, after 15 years I am going to finally review this game.

back in the day it was a great game with great graphics for its time, valve worked hard on this game.


old classic but still good."
6649,"This game changed alot.

Every team who have convinced themselves as ''pros'' use aimbot and i can guarantee you about that

Anyways, lets not talk about the toxic side

Counter strike 1.6 is a VERY old game that was really loved at the time, it had older versions such as 1.5, 1.4, 1.3, there are more older versions, if i remember correctly they made counter strike 0.8 first, several maps were removed in the older versions, and sadly the older versions are no longer available on steam, i think valve had to make a collection where they would contain older versions of the games, i mean its counter strike's 20th anniversary, so

suprisingly people still play counter strike 1.5, and i believe there are also people who play 1.4, its not that easy to play the older versions at all, you have to do several things in order to play properly, infact some of the versions wont even open at all.

anyway, let me tell you how this game is

if you have no idea what counter strike series are about then you should probably check it out but i dont think you should play it for a while because in most of the counter strike games, there are bastards who use aimbot, and they idle their hours.

Play for atleast 20 hours, otherwise you will rage alot as a newbie

now those types of people are really indeed toxic and they somehow convinced theirselves as ''professional gaming mans'' most of them live in their mommys basement or in a cesspool, dont let them make you angry.

so the graphics are old, but that doesnt matter, the guns are fair enough, yet i dont think valve fixed their bugs in this game, there are still several bugs.

its indeed fun with friends if you're having a pvp with them

I'm giving it a 7/10 due to its toxic community, seriously these guys have nothing to do other than exploit in a game thats fucking 20 year old."
6650,I bought the wrong counter strike
6651,"best game ever
"
6652,"I've been playing this game for over 15 years now (I'm 20 btw). No amount of words could possibly even come close to describing the blissful feeling which this game used to provide me with. I've countless nostalgic memories associated with this game which I tend to go back to sometimes. 
This game is the perfect example of ""graphics doesn't matter as long as the game itself is bomb"".

Game is filled with a lot of hackers but this game has so much memories to it. If you love FPS's and Counter Strike you will love this game."
6657,"This game is very addicting. Maps with bots are a good place to start if you're new to it, to get acquainted with the shortcuts. Live players can get very competitive."

6685,"CS 1.6 is a absolute gem, but has some problems. Its an oldie, and stopped being in support of valve.

Gameplay: Its a lot more complicated than CS:GO's gameplay, noting that there is 4 different sprays for most of the weapons and that it used a different engine than Source. This engine was GoldSrc and it was much different than CS:S's and CS:GO's engines. The gameplay is lots of fun, with or without friends, but it gets a bit annoying by the fact that you can shoot through anything in this, so predictable spot, if someone wallbangs it, you're dead. Gameplay overall is great none-the-less and worth a try to new to CS players.

Sounds: Good for their time, today its more of a memory-bring-back for some long time playing CS players.
Could be improved, but it stopped being in support for a while now. It was a good decision to keep the old sounds in this game, noting the picture it will portray. 

Graphics: Was a multiplayer modification to H-L, so you know what to expect now. They were the graphics of the 2000's, very good for their time. Its another nostalgic thing to some people.

System: The VAC system is outdated and will do nothing to cheaters. Used GoldSrc engine for it. Mods for the game were easy to make and set up though.

Models and animations: The animations for the walking is very weird, it stutters. It might be my version of the game but sometimes the models would be pointing in another direction and still hit me. The death animation had no ragdolls, as it was preset. Headshots would cause a blood explosion, giving you the pleasure of getting headshots.

Overall: A great game, not a waste of time. Find good servers and smooth servers, barely any lag."

To newer players who would want to experience the raw pure bloody combat, this is the game for you, raw action. Although weapon choices are limited but players can easily master them, as long as they have good aim and know to manage the recoil. The action and violence may put off some whiny people, but yes anyone can play this, young old rich poor should at least experience the gritty violence this classic has to offer.

6962,"This game was much better before Steam, hosted on the WON or World Opponent Network.
Now there is too much lag, the servers have poor hit reg, many players use cheats.
The servers are too big in size, anything over 16 player for public is too many and defeats the strategy of each map.
All the steam interface adds too much latency and ruins the experience.
UK doesn't host any servers, having to connect to far away servers adds latency which makes the game unplayable.
Bots have also ruined the experience.
Overall I would have to rate the experience 0/10, but in the current year there isn't any multiplayer game I am able to rate higher than 0/10 so it is par for the course."

7026,"t's a classic game. I heard about it from friends. Also from the geography from where I am, it'd've been very likely that local kids and young adults already knew about it when I was growing up. Loved it as a kid. Learned a lot from it as well not just as gameplay. Made a lot of friends. A big part of the local (nation-wide) community is like-minded. It brings nostalgia. Too bad that it's dying over the years. Everyone moves onto something else. Being able to create/modify your own mod boosted one's intelligence as a kid. To many, this was the beginning point of their career in programming. This wasn't/isn't just a game, it's way more than that. It's my childhood and so it is to many others - a treasure of memories. One could say it's the heart of FPS games. I wish I could turn back time and relive the moments. Even the boring time. Now I am a grown up. This game will be forever with me, I'll carry it in my heart. I hope to be able to share stories about it with my children and grand-children one day. No other game could match it. More than just computer code - a platform for friendship.

7207,"Parents need to know that Counter-Strike is a competitive, team-based first-person shooter available for download on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux-based computers. Players are split into teams of either terrorists or counter-terrorists, competing online in a number of scenarios including keeping or rescuing hostages and setting or disarming bombs. Violence is a staple of matches, with players using a variety of realistic weapons, such as guns and knives, to eliminate the opposing team. While there's some blood and realistic violence, it’s not overly graphic. Parents should be aware that, as a competitive online game, there's a heavy reliance on online communication, which can expose kids to toxic behavior, offensive comments, and profanity from other players."

Most servers make you download a bunch of stupid sound files and models that I hate having to deal with. I personally prefer CS:GO and Counter-Strike: Source.

A miracle of the FPS genre.

This game may very well be the top FPS multiplayer game in the world.

The gameplay is awesome, Graphics not bad, and NO LAG!!

This game is worth buying, and if you like buying AKs and shooting counter terrorists ot the opposite.. The gun shop is amazing. There are AKs, M60s, M16 s SMGS, desert eagles! AND ALL OTHER TOTAL PWNAGE WEAPONS OF MASS KILLING AND FUNYASTICNESS!

But there is a downfall.....DRUMROOOOOOOOOOOL

NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!!

AVERAGE COUNTER STRIKE ENJOYER"
7414,Its a classic. you gotta play if you know this...
7415,"G.O.A.T

It's a classic game. I heard about it from friends. Also from the geography from where I am, it'd've been very likely that local kids and young adults already knew about it when I was growing up. Loved it as a kid. Learned a lot from it as well not just as gameplay. Made a lot of friends. A big part of the local (nation-wide) community is like-minded. It brings nostalgia. Too bad that it's dying over the years. Everyone moves onto something else. Being able to create/modify your own mod boosted one's intelligence as a kid. To many, this was the beginning point of their career in programming. This wasn't/isn't just a game, it's way more than that. It's my childhood and so it is to many others - a treasure of memories. One could say it's the heart of FPS games. I wish I could turn back time and relive the moments. Even the boring time. Now I am a grown up. This game will be forever with me, I'll carry it in my heart. I hope to be able to share stories about it with my children and grand-children one day. No other game could match it. More than just computer code - a platform for friendship."

I remember so well coming home from school to play this on the old Dell computers from 2000’s and being totally immersed and in awe of this game. 

This game holds its own even after 20+ years and that says something. Still fun to play to this day."

Recomendado!! mi primer juego y sigue siendo de mis favoritos!"
7552,good
7553,It's a fun game that we all should play and have fun in it!!
7554,"You know what they say: ""You won't ever replace the original"". Out of all Counter-strike games, this one is my most played one (Steam+Nosteam time) and probably most enjoyable one, head to head with CS Source. It is conventional at its core and I love it. Community server browser with loads of servers to play on, many different modes to choose from. It offers you a lot and it has infinite replayability. The core of the FPS is very well established with a gun menu to choose from as well as extra equipment such as armor, grenades, night-vision, etc. Basic Counter-terrorist vs Terrorist gameplay with vanilla missions being Arm/Defuse a bomb and Protect/Rescue hostages. Graphics are bad, expectedly with the GoldSrc engine but let's face it we are all used to them by now. Physics are sloppy and you can at times look through the whole map because of one corner. The shooting recoil is very bad as well. There are a lot of cheaters even nowadays and sometimes servers have too many addons and mods. Honestly, all of this is unnecessary - it's a classic, it's cheap on sales and it is a top-tier FPS - buy it!

Score - 10/10"
7555,very good game i like.

This is the Love of games!
This is the Love of esports!
This is Love for girls! :)

This is not just a game and it is not for your entertainment in the evenings! This is the # 1 world esports discipline!

It is difficult to evaluate this game somehow, since this is a part of my youth and the first steps in esports, when I was still 11-12 years old :)
At that time, the sky was bluer, and the grass was greener, and the Orcs were no match for the present ... although what am I talking about .... it is from another….

The most important thing in this game is the Team and the Spirit that it contains!

It doesn't matter what is in your hands! It can be M4A1 and AK-47, or even an ordinary knife!
But all this no longer makes sense when you feel like 1,000,000 eyes are looking at you online, and you need to defuse this bomb or detonate it, and then everything depends on your Team!
You just go to Length and make a headshot, then make a minus from the Elephant and here it is! But do not forget to discard 2 Flashes on the Zigzag and make 2 more minuses from your Desert Eagle, and now you are left alone! And time goes by….

Years of life pass in the same way, but you, as always, will love this game and smile after 10 -100 years when you see it :)
And, seeing how new gamers play something newer, smile with a grin behind their back and burn the same fire of Love for this world of video games for the rest of their lives!

A few words about the technical capabilities of the game….
Over the past 10x years, the World has changed 10 times! But this game remained the same as it was in 1999-2000!
If you want to see what the World was like then, and what it was like to live in the World of esports at the turn of 1000 years! Then you need to play this game for 1000 hours so that your eyes and hands and brain are immersed in this World and stay here forever with Love in your heart!
Yes, there is a lot of something beyond new and amazing around, but why all this?
When you have your favorite game in your hands, and you see your favorite Team of friends on the monitor!
But they are not so young anymore, so your girlfriend will be under the table :)

7774,Much more harder than CSGO. Map is super open and most walls are penetrable. Recoil control is just intense compared to CSGO & it feels more satisfying after killing someone in CS1.6 than in CSGO. This game (& CSS) is also my childhood & I'll always get the nostalgia when playing old CS. Community maps that are modded is definitely more creative & funny.

8037,"This was a game in my childhood and it's still incredible.  I doubt it's still alive in many ways but I will always appreciate this game for what it gave me.  Gimmicky servers, gimmicky maps, and a crap load of absolutely fun times.  So many original maps, so many original server ideas.  Super powers, grappling hooks, anti-grav, and a BUNCH of others that were all impressively fun for its time, and still even when I go back to it now and then?  Still incredibly fun.  It may say I've only played this for 43 hours, but I actually used to play this game *a lot more* in the early 2000's before it really counted toward your total play time.  I would love to see this old game get a resurgence, and I don't doubt for a second there's somewhere online to find all the old CS maps that have long since fallen into oblivion."

This is the Love of games!
This is the Love of esports!
This is Love for girls! :)

[b] This is not just a game and it is not for your entertainment in the evenings! This is the # 1 world esports discipline! [/b]

It is difficult to evaluate this game somehow, since this is a part of my youth and the first steps in esports, when I was still 11-12 years old :)
At that time, the sky was bluer, and the grass was greener, and the Orcs were no match for the present ... although what am I talking about .... it is from another….

[b] The most important thing in this game is the Team and the Spirit that it contains! [/b]

It doesn't matter what is in your hands! It can be M4A1 and AK-47, or even an ordinary knife!
But all this no longer makes sense when you feel like 1,000,000 eyes are looking at you online, and you need to defuse this bomb or detonate it, and then everything depends on your Team! 
You just go to Length and make a headshot, then make a minus from the Elephant and here it is! But do not forget to discard 2 Flashes on the Zigzag and make 2 more minuses from your Desert Eagle, and now you are left alone! And time goes by….

Years of life pass in the same way, but you, as always, will love this game and smile after 10 -100 years when you see it :)
And, seeing how new gamers play something newer, smile with a grin behind their back and burn the same fire of Love for this world of video games for the rest of their lives!

A few words about the technical capabilities of the game….
Over the past 10x years, the World has changed 10 times! But this game remained the same as it was in 1999-2000! 
If you want to see what the World was like then, and what it was like to live in the World of esports at the turn of 1000 years! Then you need to play this game for 1000 hours so that your eyes and hands and brain are immersed in this World and stay here forever with Love in your heart! 
Yes, there is a lot of something beyond new and amazing around, but why all this? 
When you have your favorite game in your hands, and you see your favorite Team of friends on the monitor! 
[b] But they are not so young anymore, so your girlfriend will be under the table :) [/b]

8109,"Clan XA's servers are the only good servers. Every other server falls to one of the following blunders:
1) Overbearing moderation (If I can't swear once in a blue moon without moderation getting on my tail in a game about literal terrorism, then I'm not going to play on that server.)
2) A million and one plugins, all serving no purpose besides a vanity that you can find in CS:GO
3) Just... not the same game man. (24/7 Servers, Zombie Survival, Deathmatch, etc.)"

8312,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:

I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.

Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.

I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.

I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though."

8319,"I have played this game for more than a decade and I just recently buy it on steam. I must say, this game is still something out of this world. I have never expected to attach to it so much after just one hour of playing one decade ago, I say this with my hand on my heart, this game has been a part of my life."
8320,"This has to be the most fondly memorable game of my childhood/teenage years. More so than CS: Source even. It's a shame that no-one plays it now, it's still a really fun and nostalgic game. It's easy to play, but incredibly hard to master. I'd go as far as to say that it's more balanced and competitive than CS: GO (no thanks to the new CS: GO maps..). 

It was a LAN party favourite and we also played it online in early ADSL days. Despite it's dated graphics, the gameplay still holds up. Where will today's online games be in 20 years time? Probably totally dead and unplayable. But not this game!"

8436,Best  game I played from my childhood
8437,"This game is so old, there are people born later than when it was popularly played who are now old enough to drink, drive, and breed. Though its golden days are long over, it still has enough players that you can jump on a server with active players any time of day, 24/7.

... okay, I admit, that personally it's hard to find a full server on my continent at certain unreasonable hours on weekdays for about three hours, and if I want a lively game I have to accept a 140ms lag minimum (the speed of light is such an annoying limitation) and struggle to understand what exactly I'm being yelled at for by a Russian-speaking admin, but I really SHOULD be sleeping... and I digress.

One of the best things about this game is that it doesn't try to pretend to be ""realistic"" past a certain point. I would say that it gives the gameplay a better feel than more modern games. All the players are made up of flat paper polygon textures. There is lighting but it is flat and simple, if you're in a dark area you're just darker. There is no dust or glare or complex plants or grass to hide in. It makes visual scanning of your area efficient and puts more emphasis on effective shooting and motion, your management of your weaponry, how well you can balance taking action and concealing your position and timing your engagements, and cooperating effectively with your teammates.

The control and movement in the game are sharp (if you've tuned your configuration effectively) and though simple in a basic sense, there are extremely advanced techniques that can always be improved. The unique air-strafe ability is of course both totally unrealistic and legendary as a built in almost magical quirk that allows for reality bending twists in the air as well as stretching out your possible distances for jumping gaps and avoiding complete annihilation by a sudden unexpected enemy, but require precise control and even a well-trained strafer can get shot just before a jump and end up hopping uselessly and mowed down by gunfire instead of bouncing away in matrix-style bullet dodging unpredictable weaves and feints. It doesn't make anybody invincible but can turn around a critical and seemingly hopeless situation and is highly amusing for all the dead players spectating the remaining battle to see.

Since this game can be played on much older hardware, it is more accessible to more people in the world. I like to have a certain minimum performance -- if I get slowdown in the middle of intense fighting on a 32 player server, I do my best to keep tweaking settings until I can play with a solid framerate even if it means plyaing at 640x480 resolution because you know what? The game has always been played with that low graphics setting in mind, and it still works wonderfully. Some people may forego fluid motion and response for a much higher resolution to get clear views and see those little elbows through small windows for careful sniping or because they're playing 5v5 pick up games instead of 32 player melees with big full team rushes happening all the time. To each their own. I play (at the moment) on a laptop that can handle a slightly higher framerate than the 60Hz built in lcd, so when I have my 75Hz external monitor hooked up, I really feel the 25% higher framerate, and this is from a monitor I picked up on the roadside that somebody didn't want any more because it is 12 years old. My point being, anybody can put a bit of effort into making their playing experience better and it barely has to cost anything (other than carrying a 12 pound lcd a few kilometers home on a bicycle) and you can literally feel the higher ability it gives you. Right now, I can tell I need a slightly lower friction mouse pad, because I have my crosshairs jump a bit too far every time I move my mouse, since I changed my setup around a bit recently. I know when I get a new surface and test it and find it better, I will probably play for a few hours and be energized and focussed. I don't know that I'll do well, but I'm sure I'll be excited enough to attempt some hilarious gambits.

I do wish that enough players were still into this game that the more specialty servers were still populated, and that more maps were popular. I miss sa_treetops, and servers with wall jumps and parachutes to help reaching normally unreachable map areas. Soccer modded servers too, I think counter-strike soccer maps were probably my favorite sports game of all time, but it's rare to find one with that key minimum 3 on 3 or 4 on 4 players, playing soccer seriously, being aware of team position and at least trying to be cooperative team players. But there are still surf servers. There are highly modded warcraft 2 servers if you want crazy extra abilities you can spend time levelling up. there are zombie servers and jailbreak, climbing and bunnyhop, and of course straight up deathmatch respawn free-for-alls.

And if you're lucky, you may find the rare server that plays that rare map, de_dust2. If you see it being played you better jump on, if you don't, you might miss it and you'd never find it being played ever again since its so unfamiliar to so many players and has such unbalanced and confusing map design.

Play cs 1.6. Just don't waste time when your team has an objective to accomplish. Do crazy unpredictable aggressive things if you're having a bad day playing, and even if you die horribly, you might inspire some of your teammates back into fighting spirit.

Thus ends my full flowing, free-flailing fire hose excuse for a review. I have no idea why I'm writing it. Oh yeah that mouse jumping issue. I think I'll pull out that external monitor and try some various mousepad surfaces, and be back on the pubs before the night's out. gg, noobs. -lazy"
8438,the best game evr
8439,GOOD!
8440,"My 1st review to a game ----

The very best FPS in all video-game history. Way better than Halo, Battlefield and CoD. This masterpiece evolve the Steam platform and eSports competitive community all around the globe due to its more than just a game, its totally an experience and a way of living with mouse-keyboard game. It's a skill-based game that promotes friendship, discipline, communication, personalization, programming (on console) and promotes to work as a team. This game helped me to improve all my communication skills under English and French languages, (writing/speaking/understanding) in all levels and develop leadership skills in order to take decisions. 

This game along w/ all Counter Strike Anthology impacted my life way more than expected due to I started playing it w/ some high school friends since 2002 (versions - 1.3, 1.5 and 1.6) and before Steam even existed, spending hundreds of hours in a big cyber-cafe making lots of friends and being recognised at LAN parties around my area by my skills and it was very excited to be under Counter Strike tournaments meeting a lot of good and skilled people that nowadays still are in my life and one of them is still dedicating his life to be a PRO, streaming CS:GO.

Counter Strike back then changed my way to see technology so I changed the scholarship degree I wanted to get as well. I still have my 2000's Half Life - Counter Strike Gold hard copy, extremely rare to find nowadays in my own personal gaming museum. <3

Counter Strike - You will be always on my heart, mind and soul."

8456,"[h1]Best Game Ever[/h1]

[b]Counter-Strike[/b], CS for friends, ""Rush B"" for close friends, is one of the rare games, whose gameplay is a perfection, although it has been changed and refined over the many versions. Developed by valve, [b]Counter-Strike[/b] is a first-person shooter with a large community, especially since the release of [b]Counter-Strike: Global Offensive[/b] (CSGO) in 2012. CS allows you to choose your side between Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists different objectives, depending on the camp and the map chosen, must be achieved in order to win the game. You also have a wide selection of existing weapons divided into 5 categories (Pistols, Shotguns, SMG, Rifles and MachineGuns) 2 other categories that allow you to buy ammunition for pincipal and secondary weapons, followed by an eighth category for equipment. In short, CS one of the best if not the best FPS I’ve ever played in my life."

Normalerweiße , wäre das spiel für mich sehr gut - nicht nur aus nostalige feelingen, jedoch die ""verblödetete kinder community"" versuch den ganzen spaß zu zerstören , absichtliche provkationen , wenn man gut spielt wird sofort behauptet das man hackt und was ich schon alles gehört habe, es gibt ein paar gute servers, die aber 2020 fast leer sind , und die trash ""standart austauschbaren server"" sind die einzigen die gut befült sind. Der trend startete übrigens 2016, aber zurück zu das Spiel , das spiel finde ich trozdem besser als cs go , weil bei cs go alles nach plastatik aussieht und die zombie , jailbreak , deathrun server sind sowieso fast alle ein reines disaster.
Einer der größten punkten warum ich noch heute 1.6 spiele , da es nicht alles nur um waffen skins get , cs go hat aktuell durschnitlich ~ +/- 800,000 Spieler, davon spielen 750,000 es nur wegen die skins die anderen spielen es garnicht sind nur afk , traurig.
Ich merke gerade ich rede schon wieder um den heißen brei (tut mir leid :P).

Normally, the game would be very good for me - not just for nostalgic feelingen, but the ""stupid kids community"" tries to destroy all the fun, deliberate provocations, if you play well, they will immediately claim that you are hacked and what I have heard already, there are a few good servers, but they are almost empty in 2020, and the trash ""standard exchangeable servers"" are the only ones that are well filled. The trend started in 2016, but back to the game, I still think it is better than cs go, because cs go looks like plastic and the zombie, jailbreak, deathrun servers are almost all a pure disaster anyway.
One of the biggest points why I still play 1.6 today, because it's not all about weapons skins, cs go has currently an average of ~ +/- 800,000 players, 750,000 of them play it only because of the skins, the others play it not at all are only afk, sad.
I just realize that I'm talking around the bush again (sorry :P).

I was a NaVi supporter back then, with Markeloff being my favourite player ever. To this day, I cherish the original line-up: Markeloff, Starix, Edward, Zeus and Ceh9.

It's too bad they dissolved the CS 1.6 esports scene and replaced it with CS GO. Nevertheless, feels great to have lived in that era with no stupid battle royale games, no worthless ranked matches, hence no toxic community. CS 1.6 was a personable game and will always remain the best in the entire Valve series to me."

8711,"Counter Strike,

A miracle of the FPS genre.

Giving this game a score less than 10, will result in shame. Play this game, then play a modern FPS multiplayer game, and you will see that this game was the innovator. A deliverer of fine quick reflex shooting and an unlimited skill learning curve. A provider of that instant gratification kill which was solely based on skill. There are no perks, levels, experience points to give you the edge. You are either the best of the match, or you aren't. You cant become ""level 100"" by just playing 15 hours a day like most modern day multiplayer shooters. When you die, you have to wait. This is the punishment. You wait, and watch, and learn your enemies tactics, and choice of weapons. You learn who's the best, so that you can save that extra flash bang just for that sucker. This punishment is gives tremendous value to the kill. When the other player is dead, hes gone. He's crying, lighting up a cigarette, going to the bathroom, watching how badass you are, or all of the above. He was eliminated, gone, for 10 minutes. The team tactics are a whole other story. If a team is being plastered by another team with more skilled players, it can make a comeback with team tactics. Team tactics are essential to the success of an average team. Also the level of modifications that this game offers cannot be overlooked. Every weapon has its own characteristics, and your fighting style must adapt to the weapon you have chosen. Yes this is also true with modern shooters, but CS emphasized this more. There are no cheap weapons, no grenade launchers or rocket launchers. Every weapon is completely balanced, and even a hand gun can do the trick if you know how to use it. There is no auto-aim (hello Halo and Call of Duty?) Its you, the mouse, the gun, the target retical, and your enemies face.

This game, is a perfect score of 10, and none less."

8724,"I am recommending this because of nostalgia. If you are someone who has never played counter-strike 1.6, I would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counter-strike got its roots from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouch walking (some may call it silent-stepping, ground strafing, g-staffing), quick-switching to reload faster, boosting people through roofs, the insane amount of wall bangs you can do. Some do raise the skill cap. Where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, shopping was around before counter-strike but counter-strike had bhop communities as well. This is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models. This and counter-strike: condition zero are the only counter-strike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counter-strike which made knifing non-competitive. You could get a headshot with a knife; how could you not like that! The graphics are definitely dated by today’s standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it. Counter-strike does not have a built-in matchmaking ladder-like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much esports history made in counter-strike. The reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement cheating protection know as Valve Anti-Cheat with counter-strike being the main focus. This game reminds you just how good you had it when you were a kid and not many games can rival the impact counter-strike has had on the esports and gaming industry."

8770,"I grew up on this game and in 1999 I walked into a lan center and paid $4 for a hour of playing on one of their computers with a friend. This is the game we played, it was CS 1.3 and the map was CS_Assault we also played some fy_iceworld fy_poolday cs_bloodstrike and some cs_office de_dust2 and deaztec the difference between the maps was rescuing hostages and defusing and planting bombs. I had never played a game where I could multiplay with 10 plus teammates against 10 plus enemies all real people and getting to buy guns before the rounds and playing big great designed maps with all weapons ranging from powerful assault rifles to long sniper rifles to the up close smgs like a mp5 or a shotgun or melee knife. You also have flash grenades smokes and h&e grenades. This was a valve game that any half life player loved and I see I had close to 800 hours played on this account and havent been on the game for probably 8 years 1.5 or even the new CS Global Pffensive was probably 2016. But best game ever, and any PC gamer must play this game just like any xbox player has to play halo before they can call themselves a gamer! This game is made for all ages, Watch Frag or Die on YouTube if you want to see the vintage tremendousness of this game in one video!"

 ... okay, I admit, that personally it's hard to find a full server on my continent at certain unreasonable hours on weekdays for about three hours, and if I want a lively game I have to accept a 140ms lag minimum (the speed of light is such an annoying limitation) and struggle to understand what exactly I'm being yelled at for by a Russian-speaking admin, but I really SHOULD be sleeping... and I digress.

 One of the best things about this game is that it doesn't try to pretend to be ""realistic"" past a certain point. I would say that it gives the gameplay a better feel than more modern games. All the players are made up of flat paper polygon textures. There is lighting but it is flat and simple, if you're in a dark area you're just darker. There is no dust or glare or complex plants or grass to hide in. It makes visual scanning of your area efficient and puts more emphasis on effective shooting and motion, your management of your weaponry, how well you can balance taking action and concealing your position and timing your engagements, and cooperating effectively with your teammates. 

The control and movement in the game are sharp (if you've tuned your configuration effectively) and though simple in a basic sense, there are extremely advanced techniques that can always be improved. The unique air-strafe ability is of course both totally unrealistic and legendary as a built in almost magical quirk that allows for reality bending twists in the air as well as stretching out your possible distances for jumping gaps and avoiding complete annihilation by a sudden unexpected enemy, but require precise control and even a well-trained strafer can get shot just before a jump and end up hopping uselessly and mowed down by gunfire instead of bouncing away in matrix-style bullet dodging unpredictable weaves and feints. It doesn't make anybody invincible but can turn around a critical and seemingly hopeless situation and is highly amusing for all the dead players spectating the remaining battle to see.

 Since this game can be played on much older hardware, it is more accessible to more people in the world. I like to have a certain minimum performance -- if I get slowdown in the middle of intense fighting on a 32 player server, I do my best to keep tweaking settings until I can play with a solid framerate even if it means plyaing at 640x480 resolution because you know what? The game has always been played with that low graphics setting in mind, and it still works wonderfully. Some people may forego fluid motion and response for a much higher resolution to get clear views and see those little elbows through small windows for careful sniping or because they're playing 5v5 pick up games instead of 32 player melees with big full team rushes happening all the time. To each their own. I play (at the moment) on a laptop that can handle a slightly higher framerate than the 60Hz built in lcd, so when I have my 75Hz external monitor hooked up, I really feel the 25% higher framerate, and this is from a monitor I picked up on the roadside that somebody didn't want any more because it is 12 years old. My point being, anybody can put a bit of effort into making their playing experience better and it barely has to cost anything (other than carrying a 12 pound lcd a few kilometers home on a bicycle) and you can literally feel the higher ability it gives you. Right now, I can tell I need a slightly lower friction mouse pad, because I have my crosshairs jump a bit too far every time I move my mouse, since I changed my setup around a bit recently. I know when I get a new surface and test it and find it better, I will probably play for a few hours and be energized and focussed. I don't know that I'll do well, but I'm sure I'll be excited enough to attempt some hilarious gambits.

 I do wish that enough players were still into this game that the more specialty servers were still populated, and that more maps were popular. I miss sa_treetops, and servers with wall jumps and parachutes to help reaching normally unreachable map areas. Soccer modded servers too, I think counter-strike soccer maps were probably my favorite sports game of all time, but it's rare to find one with that key minimum 3 on 3 or 4 on 4 players, playing soccer seriously, being aware of team position and at least trying to be cooperative team players. But there are still surf servers. There are highly modded warcraft 2 servers if you want crazy extra abilities you can spend time levelling up. there are zombie servers and jailbreak, climbing and bunnyhop, and of course straight up deathmatch respawn free-for-alls.

And if you're lucky, you may find the rare server that plays that rare map, de_dust2. If you see it being played you better jump on, if you don't, you might miss it and you'd never find it being played ever again since its so unfamiliar to so many players and has such unbalanced and confusing map design.

Play cs 1.6. Just don't waste time when your team has an objective to accomplish. Do crazy unpredictable aggressive things if you're having a bad day playing, and even if you die horribly, you might inspire some of your teammates back into fighting spirit.

Thus ends my full flowing, free-flailing fire hose excuse for a review.  I have no idea why I'm writing it. Oh yeah that mouse jumping issue. I think I'll pull out that external monitor and try some various mousepad surfaces, and be back on the pubs before the night's out. gg, noobs. -lazy"
8779,A multiplayer FPS classic!!!
8780,game
8781,"In the 2000’s, Half-Life had already taken the world by storm and the prospect of modding it was increasing in popularity. Counter-Strike was one of those mods and it became one of the most popular game modifications ever.
Even after all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that can't be ignored. No other shooter is as accessible, easy to play, simple nor skillful as this. It can be enjoyed anywhere with the 64MB portable version for LAN parties. It's all about aim, accuracy, quick reflexes but does have a strategical element since it is a tactical shooter and there's no respawning. This game was a major turning point in the history of FPS, and this game is what made online multiplayer competitive gaming so popular. It is one of the greatest esport FPS games (if not the greatest) in the gaming history and this game is still worth buying today."

Have fond memories of this game from when I started playing it back in school and Valve did a good job of revamping the graphics but keeping the classic gameplay in the form of CSGO.

It's a hot summer day in Florida.
It's always hot. I hate dedust and heat of Florida.
She walks into my office. Directly up to my counter, and strikes up a conversation.
She looks tired. 
She'd been running around the community, avoiding the Mods.
I take a drag from the cigar.
It, held in my hand by my lifted index finger, my thumb leveraging the cigar, and my clutched middle finger.
The Mods... A vicious group of talented hackers and moderators, that have run the community.
Some benefit, others don't.
I exhale.
This community has been spiraling for a while. 
We used to have a proud population of nearly 70 thousand.
Now a days, we are lucky if we can get 20 thousand people in the community.
Most moved away from this cold place to a bright and warm Global world.
I take a second drag.
What is it?
I ask.
She tells me she wants to leave this place.
She says that even though she loves this place.
The air flows out of me.
[h1] There's Nothing Left Here for me [/h1]
I sigh.
I tell her, I was late here, I never saw what this community was like in it's heyday.
I admit.
There's only two reasons most people stay here.
Nothing but the bare bones of this community is original at this point.
I shift in my desk.
She begins to weep.
I take a drag of my cigar.
I admit to her the secret.
[h1]There's Only Two Reasons .....[/h1]
I pause and exhale.
Why anyone comes around these parts anymore.
Her eyes light up.
She says she has to know.
The poor.
Those who can't afford the Global world.
Riddled by capitalism's cruel nature.
And.
Her breath taken aback with anticipation.
Gary.
She gasps.
It's always been Gary.
Gary is at the heart of this city, and all who want to know Gary, must pass through here.
I take one last drag.
And toss the cigar into the ashtray.
[h1]I'll Save you the Boring Details [/h1]
I say as I reveal my suitcase.
Gary is enough for most people.
They'll stick through the crap in hopes of finding something in themselves with Gary.
It's enough for most people.
But it's not enough for me.
I walk to the door.
I'm leaving this town, I say.
And unless you're staying.
Well.
There's nothing more for me to come back to.
She pauses, then turns to me......"

9035,"Aight guys, after spending 800h on CS 1.6, here is my honest review.

For a game made on the end of the 90s, this game has more than 10000 players active on Steam. The community is pretty active, pretty decent, someone are veterans who refuse to play other source games such as csgo and get the 10 years coin or the service medal.

This game is a fps which is divided by 2 teams. Terrorists which mission is detonate the bomb sucesfully on their main target or eliminate the Enemy team and counter-terrorists which mission is to defuse the bomb in time before it explodes or eliminate the terrorists.

There is other official mode which is the ""hostage"". The main mission for terrorists is to defend the hostage and the counter-terrorists rescue all hostages. Unlike csgo which you win 1 round by taking 1 hostage, other source/gold source engine games such as cs 1.6, you need to take ALL the hostages before time ends. Still a fun mode to try it out.

There is many modes created by the community, such as deathmatch, zombie escape (my favourite mode), jailbreak, AWP matches and more.

The objective to deathmatch is to kill many enemies fast as you can. Like csgo. Zombie escape you need to escape from that Control point before they infect you. The objective is to escape them sucessfully. Jailbreak i dunno because I never played. When i Started to play, I'm going to update this guide. AWP is the same mode to CSGO casual, but you need to kill the Enemy team with the awp [spoiler]or knife, who cares[/spoiler].

The only negative part is the price. 9.99€ is a bit expensive, I recommend to wait this game be on sale. Normally the price drops for a euro or 1.79€ on this summer sale [spoiler]it ended the summer sale lol[/spoiler], but yeah. Game is fun, decent community, just play for fun like I do.

Case you can't afford cs 1.6 and your PC is kinda a potato that can't Run CSGO, there is 1 cs game for free on Steam store you can play for awhile and it's fun to play. Game is Counter-Strike nexon studio, as known cs online to worldlive.

My Mark to 1.6 is a 9.8/10. Worth to play, fun game, just wait to be on sale and everything is Solved.

Sorry for my terrible English, i'm not an US citizen, much less an UK Citizen.

Have a nice day."
9036,yes

A miracle of the FPS genre.

This game may very well be the top FPS multiplayer game in the world.

9066,"[b]Counter-Strike[/b] was born thanks to [b]Half-Life 1[/b]. At first [b]Counter-Strike[/b] was only a modification for [b]Half-Life 1[/b] but after it got so much popularity, it was released as a standalone title.

[u][b]Pros:[/b][/u]
- Very solid playerbase since its release
- Iconic Maps
- Lot of custom content (Custom maps, skins etc.)
- Many weapons

[u][b]Cons:[/b][/u]
- Outdated graphics [i](The game is from 2000 so it's obvious)[/i]
- The weapon recoil/spray is unrealistic

For me it's only a [b]9/10[/b], but for most people I guess it's a [b]10/10[/b]. It's a very great classic and still is popular."

9106,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:

I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful.. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.

Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.

I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.

I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though."

9133,"This splendid game was one of my greatest PC gaming experiences in my life. There's a ton of fun to be had here. I have a story on how I encountered this great first person shooter. See, here's the thing. I've never heard of 1.6 before. Shocking, I know. Well I've heard of its successor, Counter-Strike: Source. I wanted to play it, but I did not know of its existence on Steam. Even if I knew, I didn't have the money for it. So I went online to download it off a site. Then I found a download for Counter-Strike. It said the game was Counter-Strike: Source, so I went ahead and downloaded it. After the download, I proceeded to the install. I noticed something odd. Instead of saying Counter-Strike: Source, it said Counter-Strike 1.6. Didn't think much of it though, so I continued. Finally after installing, I started it up. I was so excited to play, but then I've noticed the menu window looked different from Source's. See for Source games like Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, Portal, etc, the window's a transparent grey style. Counter-Strike: Source has it. What I've seen was not it. The window had a military green color that wasn't transparent. You know the style Steam had during its early days? That's what it looked like. I proceeded to get into a match online. Once I got in, that's when I noticed it all. It looked different, the movement was different, the sounds were different, and there weren't ragdoll physics. It wasn't Counter-Strike: Source. That didn't bother me though. I enjoyed the game so very much. I played it for many days! I've had a ton of fun playing the game. Then one day there weren't many servers. There was like one I believe, and it wasn't filled. Starting the game up again did nothing. I did not know you could install bots into the game, so that was the end of my CS 1.6 adventures on PC for a very long while. I wanted to keep playing, but how was I supposed to do that without bots or other players? So years later I would finally be able to play the game again thanks to two apps on the Play Store called Xash3D FWGS and CS16Client. I downloaded the game files, put them in place, and started it up. I got into a match and felt a smile on my face. I got back to the world of Counter-Strike 1.6. I've noticed something very sweet on CS16Client, and that's the ability to play with bots. I've felt so excited. I learned how to add more maps and change the models for weapons, characters, and items. See, Counter-Strike 1.6 was not only one of my greatest PC Gaming experiences. It's also one of my greatest video gaming experiences of all-time. It brought joy to my heart, and I loved every second of it. Get this terrific game. I heavily recommend it.

I played Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but I prefer 1.6 much more. :)"

Between warcraft 3 mods, custom skins & gamebanana, widespread haxors and m-y-g0t (lmao this is actually censored by steam), pubmasters, clan forums, IRC, and the beginnings of CAL league- this game provided me with nothing but fond memories. I'm grateful for growing up when the internet and gaming was only just beginning to mature. The culture and community of 1.6 (and source) was the perfect result of that time period, regardless of how toxic or cringe 1337 speak was.

If I'm ever fiending for a nice dose of nostalgia, 1.6 will always satisfy that itch."

And i can explain the reason of this loud statement: just like DotA (WarCraftIII map) for RTS games, Counter Strike gave impetus to the development of e-sports and FPS in general. The level of e-sports (millions of spectators, amount of sponsors, large number of great teams) that we see today is largely due to these two games.

Pure buzz guaranteed! Still getting fun in 2020... just like 15 years ago. I miss old competitive days on LAN-parties and LAN-tournaments with my old friends. Will come back more often for a taste of nostalgia. I think people will play the game even after 30+ years... i think they will play it till generation dies, thats why i am 100% sure that this game is [b]L E G E N D A R Y !!![/b]

Thank's to all the pro-players of that decade. Thank's to all the moviemakers, casters and [url=https://www.hltv.org/]HLTV.org[/url] creators - You brightened my childhood! And also, [b]VALVe[/b], thank you for creating CS:GO/Dota 2 as a continuation of all this history and supporting the community.

The graphics look like a dirty butthole... But its old... Jesus wasn't even crucified yet when this game came out. No ranking, no lootboxes, no buttplugs, only cool guns and some pretty popular servers. If you find this review offensive just remember... no one cares."
9231,ahhh the smell of sweat and energy drinks at your local internet cafe
9232,"Counter-Strike is a game that I grew up playing.  I first tried in school during my computer classes when my friends and I finished work early.  At least once or twice, the teacher even managed to join our session.

These were good times, but also nostalgia speaking.  Counter-Strike is an FPS game from a time when FPS games had minimal graphical detail (comparative to today), with low polygon count and bitmaps that could seriously use an upgrade.  This game is strictly multiplayer, with the option for playing through LAN (setting up a server and having players connect to it) or the option of playing against bots.  

The actual game-play against humans or bots is strong even today, with tight aim controls and decent maneuverability of characters.  Depending on settings used, players typically start each round with a set amount of money to purchase their weapons, ammo, and armour.  Players typically have a limited amount of money, so your strategy begins immediately.  There are a decent selection of maps available.

Overall, this game is definitely a fun one, but at ""full cost"" I could not necessarily recommend in 2020.  If Valve/Steam spent a small amount of time to increase the maps used, I would say it is worth it.  There are just too many other games of similar cost and more recent graphics to justify purchase solely on nostalgia and memories - until Valve makes that update."

9243,"I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

9326,"Counter-Strike (CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games in which teams of terrorists battle to perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking, assassination) while counter-terrorists try to prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the release of the first game, Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification (""mod"") for Half-Life that was designed by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le and Jess ""Cliffe"" Cliffe before the rights to the mod's intellectual property were acquired by Valve, the developers of Half-Life, who then turned Counter-Strike into a retail product.
Ilike this game.
I played when I was little at 7 years old and I have over thousands of hours on this game but I didn't buy it on steam then, well, steam didn't work then on my old laptop, I was a bit new at 7 years old, I recommend it.

9348,"F I R E I N T H E H O L E Intensifies!

Having purchased the ""Valve Complete Pack"" bundle way back when, I've decided to review the original Counter-Strike solely based on my undying addiction of the series. That being said, the amount of hours on this account does not justify the shear amount of hours I've actually spent playing this game. I was introduced to this title from a very old friend of mine, that after cleaning his room had discovered the physical copy of Counter-Strike for the original Xbox. Hours turned to days, days turned to weeks etc, but the one thing I remember most about CS for Xbox, was the bot play. One of the [b]Best[/b] bot play I have ever come across. Hard bots were my bread and butter of the time, and we definitely kept the love of the game going years after, transitioning to PC and ditching controllers. (Which IMO is the definitive way to experience Counter-Strike in it's full glory.)

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
    [*]A classic of it's time. One of the most influential title to revolutionize online FPS's. Gun-play holds up very well.
    [*]Endless hours of offline bot-play.
    [*]Counter-Strike has one of the largest communities with varying amount of mods, maps, custom gamemodes, etc.
[/list]
[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Graphics/Textures are a bit dated.
    [*]Toxicity between matches may occur.
    [*]Huge learning curve, may take a lifetime to master.
[/list]

Overall, nostalgia hits hard with this game. I'd highly recommend giving this game a try! Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is actually Free-To-Play now, and revisiting this title makes me dumbfounded as to how huge the community has grown, and how the graphics have improved tremendously over the passed 20 years. Check out the [url=store.steampowered.com/bundle/232/Valve_Complete_Pack/] Valve Complete Pack [/url] aswell, It is definitely worth your money! (When on sale of course.) :)

[b]Overall Rating:[/b]
[b]9.5/10 Experience.[/b]"
9349,Good old Game
9350,"Counter Strike is an absolute staple in gaming history, and is an absolute blast to play. Almost anyone I know at least understands how to play CS:GO, even if they don't know the original 1.6. 
While I didn't play it back in the game's hayday, As it's older than me, it still holds up with gameplay. However, being such an old game with no more support from Valve itself, I do have some gripes with it, including: 

-Almost no servers in the US. Tons of middle east, Venezuelan, South American, Persian, etc. servers only. You'll have a hard time finding servers <50 latency, that are actually populated. This definitely creates a language barrier.
-Obviously outdated graphics, and an old community. While it's obvious that a 20 year old game has very bad graphics, this means that it puts off a lot of the newer demographic. You'll usually see people in their 20-40s. I rarely see any kids or people my age playing it usually.
-Strange systems and workarounds for today's era. It's hard for people to understand why people are spamming through thick walls, and how to buy ammo. Especially with no one else to play, I'm pretty sure it's hard for people to get into the game, unless they're already a massive Source/GldSource fan like me.


While I've only listed the cons right here, I don't think I'll have to talk about it's pros, and what a massive success and blast it is to play. I suppose that thousands more people have already talked about how great of a game it has been. I'm just a little disappointed at the fact that it is much harder for newer people, especially at this game, to get into this ""old looking game"". No matter what person, I'd recommend this game."

Counter-Strike, the popular online action game and first-person shooter for the PC.

Gameplay

I bought it and played it online for years. The 1.6 version is by far the best in terms of playability. When they released Counterstrike Source they traded a lot of the game play for better graphics. It's a very old game by todays standards but if, like me, you've got quite an old PC which won't play a lot of the newer games, and you want to play in real time against other real players not bots then this is the game for you. If you've never played it then here's a brief run down of what the game is about. You first decide which team you're going to play for terrorist or counter terrorist. You then equip your player with a weapon, secondary weapon, ammo, grenades, kevlar etc. Then depending on what type of map it is you have an objective if you're playing a defuse map then you need to plant a bomb and let it blow up (terrorist) or defuse the bomb (Counter Terrorist). Hostage map stop the CT's rescuing Hostages (terrorist) Rescue Hostages (Counter Terrorists) on any map there is another objective -destroy the other team. The first team to complete an objective wins the round. Depending on which server you play on there are loads and loads of variations in maps, objectives, round times etc. Some servers have custom maps with no gravity, pistols only, knives only etc. etc. etc. The game really is vast and there are still many of players worldwide who play this game.

9524,"Igra je zakon, za one strategijske igrace preporucijem"
9525,"I am recommending this because of nostalgia. If you are someone who has never played counter-strike 1.6, I would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counter-strike got its roots from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouch walking (some may call it silent-stepping, groundstrafing, g-stafing), quick-switching to reload faster, boosting people through roofs, the insane amount of wall bangs you can do. Some do raise the skill cap. Where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, bhopping was around before counter-strike but counter-strike had bhop communities as well. This is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models. This and counter-strike: condition zero are the only counter-strike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counter-strike which made knifing non-competitive. You could get a headshot with a knife; how could you not like that! The graphics are definitely dated by today’s standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it. Counter-strike does not have a built-in matchmaking ladder like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much esports history made in counter-strike. The reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement a cheating protection know as Valve Anti-Cheat with counter-strike being the main focus. This game reminds you just how good you had it when you were a kid and not many games can rival the impact counter-strike has had on the esports and gaming industry."

9652,"[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review [/h1]

Counter-Strike is a game developed and published by Valve, the classic FPS shooter

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Counter-Strike overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good action game and to play in short bursts

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

INGREDIENTS
2 large eggs
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Pinch red pepper flakes
2 tbsp. butter
1/4 c. shredded cheddar
2 tbsp. freshly chopped chives

DIRECTIONS
1. In a medium bowl, beat eggs until no whites remain, then season with salt, pepper, and a pinch red pepper flakes.

2. In a medium non-stick skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Pour in eggs and tilt pan so eggs fully cover the entire pan. As eggs start to set, use a rubber spatula to drag cooked edges into center of pan. Tilt pan to let uncooked egg fall to the edge of the pan.

3. Once the bottom is set, but top is still a little wet, sprinkle cheese and chives on one half of omelet. Fold other side over cheese and slide omelet onto a plate."

9757,"[h1] Information [/h1]

Counter-Strike, the popular online action game and first-person shooter for the PC.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

I bought it and played it online for years. The 1.6 version is by far the best in terms of playability. When they released Counterstrike Source they traded a lot of the game play for better graphics. It's a very old game by todays standards but if, like me, you've got quite an old PC which won't play a lot of the newer games, and you want to play in real time against other real players not bots then this is the game for you. If you've never played it then here's a brief run down of what the game is about. You first decide which team you're going to play for terrorist or counter terrorist. You then equip your player with a weapon, secondary weapon, ammo, grenades, kevlar etc. Then depending on what type of map it is you have an objective if you're playing a defuse map then you need to plant a bomb and let it blow up (terrorist) or defuse the bomb (Counter Terrorist). Hostage map stop the CT's rescuing Hostages (terrorist) Rescue Hostages (Counter Terrorists) on any map there is another objective -destroy the other team. The first team to complete an objective wins the round. Depending on which server you play on there are loads and loads of variations in maps, objectives, round times etc. Some servers have custom maps with no gravity, pistols only, knives only etc. etc. etc. The game really is vast and there are still many of players worldwide who play this game.

[h1] Feedback  [/h1]

Ccounter strike is a good game despite the many years"
9758,"Half-Life doesn't have proper widescreen support. You could increase your fov tho to 105 to negate that tho. HOWEVER in CS they disabled that. Play in 4:3 or go fuck yourself. Actually, this is 1.6. 1.5 still has servers. I highly doubt they would ban you for widescreen hacks in that. wink wink. 1.5 is pre-steam, btw. Oh same applies to Deathmatch: Classic and that other version of cs nobody cares about. BUT those probably don't have alot of servers if any. Search WON2 online. OR play source."
9759,"Игрушка довольно хороша. Но....
Здесь настолько дружелюбные игроки, что они любят всю твою семью.
Здесь ты можешь найти отца, и узнать кто водит твою мамку в кино.
Здесь 10 летние гении со всего мира научат тебя жизни, и помогут пополнить словарный запас.
Здесь проверяется твое терпение и выносливость.

9772,"This game is my childhood. 
I still find it more fun than CS:GO, COD, or any other game.
All players start equal.
Rounds are short and usually fast paced.
The lack of fancy graphics makes it all about teamwork, tactics and reflex.
Play it with people you know in real life(so there's more tolerance, teamwork and humor), and you're likely to enjoy it.
+ this game runs on everything.

Random servers can be meh... People sometimes take the game way too serious.
Custom modes are awesome.

Counter-Strike was a massive part of my childhood, playing games like Counter-Strike on my Uncle's massive 8M projector screen, wow. Nothing beats the feeling of the skill-based combat. Moving onto online is a whole other feat, I mostly played against BOT Gabe. Hands down, one of the best shooters ever made, and while it does miss exclusive Xbox map Miami, it is worth playing. Especially on console. Endless hours of rewarding fun to be had."

9876,"Counter Strike is a classic. Terrorists need to plant bombs. The SWAT needs to diffuse the bomb or prevent the terrorists from planting it. This game is purely nostalgic. The graphics might look old today, but it was pure fun to play it at LAN-parties and it is still fun to play nowadays. Counter Strike made our informatic classes bearable.

In my opinion it is better than CS GO. You might not believe it, but there are still plenty of active servers full of people playing this old-school shooter.

CS is a must-have for every gamer. But if you are a real gamer that wasn’t born in 2010, you should already own this pearl."

Eventually I got money from Valve and helped the game become better by reporting some 0days RCE bug on Valve's bug bounty program. Sadly Valve is always very slow with responding to RCE reports on GoldSrc games. I still have a 0days that has not been resolved by them. Nevertheless, this game is truly a masterpiece, and it has helped me becoming who I am today."

9960,"This game shows why older games that are mod-able creates a stronger sense of community, hence gaming communities/servers are now dying and people just play with their friendlist instead of expanding into something larger. You can argue both are best, but as someone who's played for a lot of years I'm glad Steam still provides this option. 

As for the game, there are too many mods and maps and servers to really judge the game overall. I find it difficult not to find a server you'll like playing on. Whether you want to guess who's an evil guy in TFT, compete to be the last surviving prisoner on Jailbreak, challenge yourself surfing around the map better and faster than others or just playing vanilla-shooer FPS style this game is for you."

10394,"[h1] Ok guys so story time [/h1]
I remember when I was about 5 years old and I would play pirated cs 1.6 (but like for real, who used to buy it back in the days?). Then when my parents weren't home I'd play the zombie maps - pretty ironic; they let me play a game that had to do with terrorists and all that stuff but not something zombie-related. I'd also fight with my sibling over the PC; oh, the good ol' days when they used to kick me off the chair. Literally. (Then idk how but they overclocked the PC so bad that some of the hardware parts melted. Gj bruv; and so I got kicked out of the gaming zone because we didn't get a PC again)

The point is, it's nice to see how gaming changed over the years, even Counter-Strike itself. It's weird to play C.s 16 again and barely be able to get a kill because of the loud sounds and weird graphics. Then I remember how cool I thought it was - like what? 15 years ago? if not more. 
Time is hella crazy.

10502,"I am recommending this because of nostalgia. If you are someone who has never played counter-strike 1.6, I would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counter-strike got its roots from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouch walking (some may call it silent-stepping, ground strafing, g-staffing), quick-switching to reload faster, boosting people through roofs, the insane amount of wall bangs you can do. Some do raise the skill cap. Where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, shopping was around before counter-strike but counter-strike had bhop communities as well. This is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models. This and counter-strike: condition zero are the only counter-strike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counter-strike which made knifing non-competitive. You could get a headshot with a knife; how could you not like that! The graphics are definitely dated by today’s standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it. Counter-strike does not have a built-in matchmaking ladder-like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much esports history made in counter-strike. The reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement cheating protection know as Valve Anti-Cheat with counter-strike being the main focus. This game reminds you just how good you had it when you were a kid and not many games can rival the impact counter-strike has had on the esports and gaming industry."

""Counter-Strike"" was one of the first videogames that were considered a sport that later on passed to be named as ""E-Sports"", it was the cybercafé's most played game probably in the world. ""Counter-Strike 1.6"" was a complete hit in the 90's, then evolved to ""Counter Strike Source"" and then ""Counter Strike: Global Offensive"" and in 2020, CSGO is one of the most watched/played e-sport in the world. This game was the standard of what should be a competitive game and now it's a piece of history of videogames, it's defenetly retro but I think everyone that appreciates videogames should defenetly have this in their library.

10812,"It is a great game which is running OpenGL game engine. I have been playing this game since 2000 but I am still playing today. I wish Valve can reproduce an OpenGL game like this again by improving its graphic, scenes and maps. It is fun and it is fast. 

Thoughts: I was surprised by the performances of most DX games that I played so far - Their reactions are slow than OpenGL games. I guess that the OpenGL game engine is much better than DX. But, I heard that MicroSoft has stopped developing  the OpenGl 3D. Why? What the waste. Interesting.

10835,"Jump in a public lobby close to your city, and break your mic out.
Forget about ranks and stats and skins. Just play the game, and have fun.

If your introduction to the series was CSGO, the original will feel vapid at first.
Getting used to using hitscan again, not seeing your bullets fly forward, and the lightweight feel to the movement will all feel strange. But rest assured, this game still packs a lot of glory. Its ability to run clean on any modern machine and wide appeal is why Counter-Strike is still a great social experience."

I have it just for my collection, but it's still got a dedicated playerbase, so don't worry too much about finding a server with players. There's almost always at least a few servers populated."
10953,"This game is pretty fun when you somehow can manage to PWN everybody on a dust server.

Atleast it's way better than CSGO because the whole game isn't run by overpriced fucking gloves and knives. Your here to have fun not to throw your wallet into the fireplace"

The players are always active and its fun to play with friends participate in tournaments etc. Having played this game since i was 5 which was 13 years ago i had loads of experience even tho i wasnt a great player and even tho it was a cracked version of the game.

11321,"First of all, don't look at my playtime. I've recently bought the game and only played before on cracked versions bc I was a poor school kid so my playtime is way higher than this.

This was my first Counter-Strike game and I loved it. Just playing this brings back so many memories of whole evenings playing on respawn servers and screwing around on ScoutzKnivez maps with my cousin. Aside from MineCraft, no other game can give me more nostalgic feelings than this one. I can recommend Counter-Strike players to start with this one, play it for a few years, jump to CS:S, play it for a few years, then go to CS:GO and repeat the same cycle. Doing that made me realise how beautiful and well-made this game was for it's time. A big thumbs up for this game and it's still non-toxic player base in 2020."

11463,"It's great, buy it for history!

Can not understand that this is old CS that many got their eyes on. Never played this myself except after I started directly on CS:GO sometimes I missed that yes missed this time but at the same time not. I would not directly say that this is a good game really, very boring graphics and it was a game where people shoot through walls as the walls were made of cardboard walls almost.

I'm glad that CS: GO got significantly better CS games, and there are still things you can improve from that game example replacing the game engine that probably won't happen for a while.

But this game can be nostalgic fun to jump into running a couple of games to get a little old feeling and fun with others.

Would I recommend this game? Absolutely."

11575,Play Counter-Strike 1.6. It's a good game.
11576," Started playing CS 1.3 or 1.4 way back in 2003 I think, it's hard to remember exactly. Then it went to 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6. 1.5 and 1.6 were my favorites. Then Source came out and it was totally different. My computer couldn't run it well so I got out of it for a while. I then started playing CS:GO  a couple years ago to give me something to do and no matter how many other games I play, this one will always be my all time favorite. There has never been as fun of a time, gaming wise, in my life as when I used to play CS 1.4,5,6. The lan parties with different clans my friends and brother and I used to go to were so much fun. It was just a really fun time to play CS.  If you wanna try a new first person shooter, Counter-Strike is where it's at. CS:GO is obviously better in terms of graphics and everything else, but regular CS is still a lot of fun to play. Go drink ya a pint of whiskey, pop and an addy and go from noob status to 1337."

Polecam cs 1.6

Pozdrawiam."
11585,aaaa
11586,Best game ever !
11587,Still the best version of counter strike. The hit detection is simply leagues ahead of css and csgo. No comparison.
11588,WOW
11589,:D
11590,"First shooter I played, grew used to it, it's super simple and fun."
11591,is good

11597,OK
11598,"Cs 1.6 is not just a game its a feeling. Played this game for like 7 to 8 years which is almost my teenage years. used to bunk school and college to play this game in every possible way. flunked my boards 2 times because of this game but have no regret. As a every hardcore gamer i also had dream to play for my country but responsibilities made me numb and i went to law school and now im a successful lawyer. but this doesnt stop me to watch old videos of complexity, n0thing, pasha, navi and many more. and here i am, installed cs 1.6 in quarantine due to covid-19. ill also be thankful to my friends whoever played with me(90% friends i met during cs 1.6 period) so yeah man, im crying a baby now. thanks"

11606,unlike cs go it's easy to hit your target and doesn't require a lot of precision. It also has a large community that has lasted for over 20 years that's keeping it alive and updated.
11607,"This is THE best game i ever played.
But unfortunately this game is very old, so is the community, that not many people are left."

This is the Love of games!
This is the Love of esports!
This is Love for girls! :)

This is not just a game and it is not for your entertainment in the evenings! This is the # 1 world esports discipline!

It is difficult to evaluate this game somehow, since this is a part of my youth and the first steps in esports, when I was still 11-12 years old :)
At that time, the sky was bluer, and the grass was greener, and the Orcs were no match for the present ... although what am I talking about .... it is from another….

The most important thing in this game is the Team and the Spirit that it contains!

It doesn't matter what is in your hands! It can be M4A1 and AK-47, or even an ordinary knife!
But all this no longer makes sense when you feel like 1,000,000 eyes are looking at you online, and you need to defuse this bomb or detonate it, and then everything depends on your Team!
You just go to Length and make a headshot, then make a minus from the Elephant and here it is! But do not forget to discard 2 Flashes on the Zigzag and make 2 more minuses from your Desert Eagle, and now you are left alone! And time goes by….

Years of life pass in the same way, but you, as always, will love this game and smile after 10 -100 years when you see it :)
And, seeing how new gamers play something newer, smile with a grin behind their back and burn the same fire of Love for this world of video games for the rest of their lives!

A few words about the technical capabilities of the game….
Over the past 10x years, the World has changed 10 times! But this game remained the same as it was in 1999-2000!
If you want to see what the World was like then, and what it was like to live in the World of esports at the turn of 1000 years! Then you need to play this game for 1000 hours so that your eyes and hands and brain are immersed in this World and stay here forever with Love in your heart!
Yes, there is a lot of something beyond new and amazing around, but why all this?
When you have your favorite game in your hands, and you see your favorite Team of friends on the monitor!
But they are not so young anymore, so your girlfriend will be under the table :)

100/100 HeadShots through the wall!"

I once wasted an entire summer break on this game. Mom even asked me, “son, would you like to go on a summer vacation” for which I replied “I am busy”. However, during COVID-19 I came back to it, because my non-gamer friends PCs sadly can't run anything graphically more complex than potato graphics. Honestly, it features so many types of game modes(public, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2062364320] deathmatch,[/url] deathrun, bunnyhop, longjump and etc.) that it's no wonder how one can get addicted to it and come back years after years and so we did.

12276,"[i]Counter-Strike[/i] is one of those multiplayer-only games that really may stand the test of time decades after its release due to its simple yet effective premise and gameplay.

What the developers have created here is very impressive, even if not by today's standards, what it has inspired and the fact that it is still played to this very day says enough on the basis of its quality. Though at first  it may be a little difficult to get into, as many players are veterans that have been playing since the game first released, you are more likely than not to come around and see just what this game has to offer. I would highly recommend you first practice with friends if possible, or find people in a server that can teach you the basics and a few skills so that you are at least not completely lost when diving in to this classic and sort of dated experience. If you own [i]Counter-Strike: Condition Zero[/i], I would also recommend you play those missions built around artificial intelligence players, as it is a great way to practice with with enemies more your skill level. Arguably, something like this should have been implemented into the base game, but alas this is not the case, much to the dismay of new players.

The concept is that of the conflict between two teams: the [i]Terrorists[/i] and the [i]Counter-Terrorists[/i], both of which are pretty self-explanatory. Though there are a few standout mechanics in this game that differ from others of the time, such as buying weapons with in-game currency, the function of this mod turned intellectual property is pretty simplistic in a good way, making it easily accessible in terms of gameplay. The main two objective-based modes are bomb defusal and hostage rescue, both of which are enjoyable in their respective ways, and they have obvious places in modern games that took inspiration from the basics of what was here, only expanding the influence this game holds over the multiplayer genre to this very day. Though the player base does prefer modded servers and the like nowadays, there are still enough playing the quality original maps that allow you to enjoy yourself and bask in the original experience of what [i]Counter-Strike[/i] brought to the table when it came out so long ago.

[i]Counter-Strike[/i] is just one of those timeless classics, but it is much more impressive solely based on the fact that is is a strictly multiplayer game, which usually is a type of title that dies out a few years after initial release and loses any value once the player base disappears, but this game is a definite anomaly, one that has outlasted many of its peers and has influence on other titles to support it even when it inevitably does lose its loyal base of players.

12356,"I will attempt to be fair with this review.

I would not personally recommend this for your $10 investment or time. 

[b] Here's Why [/b]
While this Counter-Strike built the underlying foundation in modern day shooters, this game has been brought to its knees. Variety is seemingly non-existent. In the ruins of the old-age shooter lies blackmail, exploitation, scams, and back-stabbing. (I will provide context further into the review.)

Through the many years since my purchase and time investment into the game, I have witnessed a lot of which has caused this game’s light to fade. Evidently, the age of our modern shooters have evolved along with the varying customer’s taste. No one is really fond of classic, old-age games with outdated engines and technologies. Astoundingly, that is not main impact on the game’s questionable longevity.

The remaining population is comprised of the few and, quite literally, far. The community is quite diverse with players ranging from Brazil to Saudi Arabia, and even the Philippines. However, the few are dwindling. 

[b] The Facts [/b]
- Servers pay their way to leader-board popularity by “boosting.” This is quite the scam as the boosts are typically “auctioned” with no guarantee of success. And oooooh booooy are they outrageously expensive for what they propose to offer. However, don’t blame the servers. They are just trying to gain a player base in a crippled game.

- With such a small population dwindling by the day, communities fight each other for players. Why? Because these communities come fully equipped with a P2W system that they “depend” on. Also, don’t expect any sort of compromise. Make no mistake, the P2W items in almost every shop most certainly give ANY consumer a game-killing advantage. In the end, the P2W systems in place are mostly greed over need thus furthering the war between communities.

- Communities face a handful of staff corruption. While natural in any other game with custom community servers, it is likely 10x worse under the current circumstances. At this point, most of the servers managing to stand their ground have staff teams that are well-connected through time. They’ll find just about any way to dismiss blatant corruption. If you persist, trying to be the hero the server needs, you’ll be quietly blacklisted.

- DdoS attacks are not the only type of tactic server’s use in their wars. They spy, blackmail, hack (like real hacking, not the cheating kind), and exploit players. At times, the community servers are made unplayable. Limited developers also don’t help.

- Malware! Some servers that appear as any other ordinary server will attempt to perform actions in which result in you obtaining some sort of malware. They may even trick you into giving out personal information in order to DOX you. BEWARE!

- This game does have cracked versions that can easily be obtained online which is also a contributing factor the game’s approaching death. The cracked version makes it all too easy to evade punishments. Cheaters are a real struggle in this game. It does not get updated anti-cheat detection.

- Simply put: Lots of drama in the server wars.

[b] Conclusion [/b]

I honestly wish I could recommend the game for purchase. However, I would be wronging anyone reading this review. If you still play, I wish you luck and hope you enjoy what is left. This game is on its final few breaths. It is a shame to see such a beautiful classic get crushed, completely obliterated even, for the wrong reasons. Some say this game died long ago. Realistically, there is still a mediocre population still around which makes it “appear” alive.

Do not use $10 and avoid the cracked versions. Even with the cracked versions, it is a giant waste of your time. The only reason I continue to play is because I play with friends who I’ve come to know for a long time. We enjoy playing with each other sometimes on a particular community. P2W services are unavoidable, but they do have varying levels. I can confidently enjoy the community I play. P2W nevertheless… P2W… NEVERTHELESS! However, understandable to some degree.

Edit: I would like to point out that it is very ""human"" of members among staff teams to have each others' backs, no matter the situation. This is most commonly seen as a form of corruption and just about any community has a varying degree of ""corruption."" It just so happens that, for the most part, a MAJORITY of servers have a high degree of corruption. Pretty blantant stuff... not even pulling people aside and having a ""talk."" It is just recklessness."

12359,"As you can see I played quite a bit of this game and I would want to say that this is one of the best games that I ever played. It has alot of community mods and servers, some of the people in this community can be very toxic but some of them are very nice.

Overall a good game, hands down the best game of the cs franchise and one of the best in the fps industry. I recommend this!!!

12379,the best game ever
12380,Played this game for 15 years or more. Now I'm on the CSGO scene. The best game every made in my eyes
12381,"You know what? It is actually still highly enjoyable. Especially those gungame, surf or other fun servers. 1.6 is much more dynamic than GO and is more about pure aim and less tactic/strategy. So if you wanna have fun, I think 1.6 is even better than GO. Because you don`t care about ranks or skill levels here. You don`t think through your every move or trying to remember a sick pop flash or smoke. You just have fun and enjoy your time. I mean, there are community maps and servers in cs go, but I don`t feel the same way as in 1.6 when I play there. I can somehow feel that GO is restricting me to do something, while 1.6 lets me do anything. Like blindly rush somewhere, or bhop all around the map on multi-leveled maps.

P.S. maybe I am a weirdo or just feeling nostalgic, but maps here are somehow more... I don`t know... Interesting or even weirdly beautiful? Maybe because they are less restrained in their concepts since the graphics is nowhere near realistic. While CS GO is still trying to be realistic. Like, you know, in 1.6 I just run into a server with a map, that has straight columns of water and everyone can jump in there and swim up to the sky almost. I also remember a map, where Ts are being launched into the air with some cannons and CTs are locked in a small building with awps, trying to shoot down Ts while they are flying all around in the sky :D. You won`t find this stuff in CS GO. Even on minigames or fun servers."

Unfortunately in 2008 someone hacked and stole my account because of some trend where people wanted low ID accounts like it made them special.  I contacted steam and they were unable to help me even tho it was my account and I had all the information.  Disappointing to say the least.  So my valued 9k and change hours playing this game arent exactly accurate lol.  Add an additional 3-4k hours.  That is the depth of my dedication to this game.  It is unrivaled in my opinion.  I have played all sorts of other games since but this is my mainstay!  Recommend wholeheartedly.  :)

12550,"*Ah childhood, where were you the whole time? Yep, this game is the reason why I started playing FPS games.*

Counter-Strike (1.6) is such an old nostalgic game and still played by so many people (mostly cracked users), but in my opinion, CS is just great.
It's the only reason why we got games such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, and Counter-Strike Global Offensive.
Counter-Strike was such a hit back then in 1999/2000, it was such a popular shooter that no other FPS games could compare to this. It had weapons with ""realistic"" recoil, good weapons such as AK47, AWP, and M4A1, Good maps (like DE_DUST2), and the classic gamemodes (aka Defuse, Rescue, and such more). Nowadays people would play CS 1.6, returning to this game and remembering the old times.
The community had made so many mods for this game, new maps, new weapon skins, even new gamemodes! Such as, Zombie Plague (A pure classic), Deathrun, Gungame, and such more. I mostly loved Zombie Plague because it was somewhat fun for me to play as a child because I would literally sit on my chair and just enjoy shooting Zombies from one spot.
I highly recommend playing this game, bought or cracked, its your choice, and most importantly, have fun with the game!"

12590,"This game is amazing, from the wide variety of maps, to the ability to bhop and gain speed up to 300 u/s (seems like nothing but it helps a lot). Practice really makes perfect in this game because basically everything is balanced, the only thing that isn't fair, is some of the maps, even then, it's easy to dominate if you play. Deagle is amazing, AK is amazing, every gun in this game has it's cons and it's pros, AK is really, really strong but the recoil gets really messy, Deagle is a one shot wonder if you can aim, but only 7 rounds in the mag, you can tell valve or whoever made this did an amazing job at it. This game is better in many ways compared to GO. While bhopping though, be careful, read the rules on the servers you join, and just have a blast.
Did I tell you that you can bhop?

Just a little tip, stay still while firing, if you move at all, your bullets will fire everywhere except where you're aiming. If you go one direction, your weapon will follow, you hold A to go left, the bullets will go left as well, same for grenades. Always aim for the head as well, it's so good lmao."

Weapons:
CSGO - Has a recoil pattern for all weapons, some are the same. Weapon spread is quite tight unless you're jumping.
CS - No recoil patterns, completely random spread. Spread is absolutely broken when jumping

CSGO - Bullets have realistic penetration
CS - You can literally get killed from T spawn because walls are made of paper.

Voice chat:
CSGO - If you're under the age of 15, expect to get raped.
CS - ""rush b cyka blyat noob""

Surfing:

CS - yes
CSGO - right so we have this thing called VAC and it hates surfers"

Counter-Strike (CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists battle to perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking, assassination) and counter-terrorists try to prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first game, Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification (""mod"") for Half-Life and designed by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le and Jess ""Cliffe"" Cliffe before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve, the developers of Half-Life.

That original game was followed by Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. In November of that year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released eight months after Condition Zero, Source was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.[4] The fourth game in the main series, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released by Valve in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[5]

There have been several community-made spin-off titles created over the years. These include the Online series, Neo, and Nexon: Zombies.

Gameplay
Counter-Strike is an objective-based, multiplayer first-person shooter. Two opposing teams—the Terrorists and the Counter Terrorists—compete in game modes to complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or guarding hostages.[6][7] At the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their individual performance with in-game currency to spend on more powerful weapons in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds results in more money than losing, and completing objectives such as killing enemy players gives cash bonuses.[6] Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, results in a penalty.[8]

Counter-Strike
Main article: Counter-Strike (video game)
Originally a modification for Half-Life, the rights to Counter-Strike, as well as the developers working on it, were acquired by Valve in 2000.

The game received a port to Xbox in 2003.[9] It was also ported to OS X and Linux in the form of a beta in January 2013. A full release was published in April 2013.[10][11]

Condition Zero
Main article: Counter-Strike: Condition Zero
Counter-Strike was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. It used the Half-Life GoldSrc engine, similar to its predecessor. Besides the multiplayer mode, it also included a single-player mode with a ""full"" campaign and bonus levels. The game received mixed reviews in contrast to its predecessor and was quickly followed with a further entry to the series titled Counter-Strike: Source.[12]

Source
Main article: Counter-Strike: Source
Counter-Strike: Source was the first publicly released game by Valve to run on the Source engine. Counter-Strike: Source was initially released as a beta to members of the Valve Cyber Café Program on August 11, 2004.[4][13] On August 18, 2004, the beta was released to owners of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and those who had received a Half-Life 2 voucher bundled with some ATI Radeon video cards.[14] While the original release only included a version for Microsoft Windows, the game eventually received a port to OS X on June 23, 2010 with a Linux port afterwards in 2013.[15][16]

Global Offensive
Main article: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was the fourth release in the main, Valve-developed Counter-Strike series in 2012. Much like Counter-Strike: Source the game runs on the Source engine. It is available on Microsoft Windows, OSX, and Linux, as well as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles, and is backwards compatible on the Xbox One console.

Spin-off titles
Neo
A Japanese arcade adaptation of Counter-Strike, the original Half-Life multiplayer modification. It is published by Namco, and runs on a Linux system.[17] The game involves anime-designed characters in a futuristic designed version of Counter-Strike. A selection of single-player missions, mini-games, and seasonal events were added to prolong the game's interest with players.[18]

Online series
Main articles: Counter-Strike Online and Counter-Strike Online 2
Counter-Strike Online is a free-to-play spin-off available in much of eastern Asia. It was developed by Nexon, with oversight from Valve. It uses a micropayment model that is managed by a custom version of the Steam back-end.[19] Announced in 2012 and aimed at the Asian gaming market, a sequel titled Counter-Strike Online 2 was developed by Nexon on the Source game engine, and released in 2013.[20]

Nexon: Zombies
In August 2014, Nexon announced Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies, a free-to-play, zombie-themed spin-off,[21] developed on the GoldSrc game engine.[22] On September 23, 2014, an open beta was released on Steam.[23] The game launched on October 7, 2014, featuring 50 maps and 20 game modes.[24] The game features both player versus player modes such as team deathmatch, hostage rescue, bomb defusal, and player versus environment modes such as cooperative campaign missions and base defending.[25] Reception from critics was generally negative with criticism aimed at the game's poor user interface, microtransactions,[25] and dated graphics.[22]"

12815,"runs fast on my older computer. still a few servers with people playing. the older cs games are a little harder because the way they're designed, also because you're playing against more experienced players.

12820,"This is the game that started it all for me when it comes to PC gaming. When I was just 13 years old, I ran this game with just 512mb of ram and integrated graphics. I knew nothing about computers but that didn't matter. I loved the game for what it was and even the idea of talking to other players with a little desktop mic with a piece of tape stuck to the bottom of it fascinated me. Today, gamers take that stuff for granted, but I don't...not anymore. From the golden age of surf and every gamemode in-between, this version of Counter-Strike was the seed to a franchise that has stayed with me for over half of my life. While the franchise will continue to change, I will never forget it's roots and the special place that it became for me everyday after school. If you have never played Counter-Strike, consider this version if you are interested in something that will provide insight into how the game has become what it is today. Game on."

After 9 years in this game I have to say that the game still has something to offer.
It's about having fun with charged friends with whom to play one great fun :)
Although most of my friends left years ago, I still like to play some bluffing mode once in the evening.

It's been over 10 years since my bumps in this game. It has become part of me. I'm so glad I had the chance to get to this game, to experience so much fun here, to get to know so many new people.

A simulator of people with a wooden brain that remained in 2000.
Generally ks 1.6. no better than ccc and cs go. I played everything. The graphics are disgusting, if you can’t retrain how to shoot, then this indicates your backwardness, the woodenness of the brain, and you are already 35-45 years old, at least.
Let's create a petition about the need to close the game and it will not be possible to play it.
If you like the game, then most likely you are retarded.
I’ll delete the review if they send me 5$ to a bank card: 4276380149823853

Ни хрена кс 1.6. не лучше ксс и кс го. Я играл во всё. Графика отвратительна, если вы не можете переобучится как стрелять то это говорит о вашей отсталости, деревянности мозга, вам же уже 35-45 лет как минимум.
Давайте создадим петицию о том что нужно закрыть игру и в неё нельзя будет играть.
Если вам нравится игра то скорее всего вы отсталый.

12983,"This is the game that got me to playing CS .When I was like 7 or 8 yrs of age this was my second FPS game after IGI . Reminiscing about those good old childhood days still brings back tears to my eyes till this day, when I didnt play against real life players that much, but used to have fun with bots. I bought this game in 2019 to refresh my memories, and yeah this game is still the same, and awesome as it was. But I have to agree that I am no longer a pro CS 1.6 player since I have moved to CS GO. I dont regret about it, but when I play CS 1.6 , I visit various CS 1.6 servers and have fun and enjoy my time, the CS 1.6 community is very non toxic , no scene of hackers , everyone enjoy the game and have fun.

If you are thinking to buy this game, dont hesitate buy it during Steam sales, this game is worth the purchase."

13105,"Культовая игра, которая два десятилетия для многих может работать, как наркотик. В нее хочеться играть и играть. Я не слишком зацикливаюсь на онлайн играх, потому что мир движется вперед, и нужно двигатся с ним. Но раньше, когда эта игра вышла, я наслаждался ей очень много лет, возвращаясь и возвращаясь. Это чистый мультиплеер, в котором есть две команды и несколько простых режимов. Графика в игре уже давно не дотягивает даже до ""адекватной"", но все же сколько лет то пройшло. 

Итог: новым игрокам не советую в нее играть, так как сейчас есть тонна мультиплеерных игр, которые абсолютно во всем лучше этой игры. Но это игра-классика, она культовая и достойна внимания."

[b] Alright For New Players, Classic For Veterans [/b]

[b] Counter-Strike [/b] has never been a series I have gotten into. I don't dislike it, but I certainly haven't had the same level of enjoyment and investment that others have had with it. I decided to try this O.G. version of the game, and I was surprised to find a decent amount of people still playing it. There are some differences compared to [b] CS:GO [/b], such as the need to purchase ammo for your weapons, as well as some slight differences to recoil and physics (can be attributed to the engines perhaps). Overall, its an easy [b] Recommend [/b] from me because of its cheap price, and the fact that it is a classic game that still manages to have populated servers. While I don't think it is the best CS game I have played, it is still a fun shooter. I won't sink too much more time into it, as I would rather put it into CS:GO when I get the chance, but I can see the merit of wanting to play this title.

[h2] Final Verdict: 6/10 (Above Average) [/h2]

13451,"I've been playing this game since 2006+ 
Such a fun FPS and more beginner friendly than CS:GO as you don't have to learn all these grenade physics knowing where to popflash and whatnot. There are plenty of modes to play, from Deathmatch to Zombie Escape you have all sorts of things. I'd recommend finding a server with a decent amount of players that have admins actively on, cause the ones that don't are generally toxic and filled with negativity. Communities such as United Gaming Community still run servers for this games and is a nice community to join, I recommend you play this game, definitely. Nothing more satisfying than carrying your team. Download Zbots and practice on New Game if you're new to the game. Don't forget to type in the console ""Mp_limitteams 0"" and ""Mp_autoteambalance 0"" that way you can add up to 20 bots to the opposite team and don't have them joining yours when the round is over, be sure to restart your server by typing ""restart 1"" in the console. That way you can have some decent practice. I generally practice with 10 bots as they can get pretty rowdy if you add more. You can also take their weapons away and practice your aim on them when they're only carrying knives."
13452,Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.

Without this action driven action first person shooter that brought moments of heart pounding confrontation between two opposing teams,  the world of  video game would not have progress so successfully  of pushing the envelope  to the next further level in warlike realism game plays.Sounds, physics, and visualizations was at he peak of its time, and after more than a decade, remains to be a treasure  gem of all time."

13651,"Counter Strike is a fun and entertaining first-person shooter video game that really jump started the online multiplayer generation in video games and is a text book basic example of what an online first person shooter should have.

Yes the game is old and yes the graphics are outdated but this game is still a masterpiece of it's generation and time. For an Online Game it ticks all the necessary boxes, there are still active servers available to play on and there are many different diverse game modes to play which is great. There are lots of weapons that can be bought using in game cash when in a match and the movement and atmosphere is exceptional and really smooth. The game has some really well designed and constructed maps that make for a fun and entertaining match with many surprises. The game has a lot of options and allows the player to customise how they play Counter Strike which is absolutely great. You can lean left and right in the game and the game has very few bugs and issues which gives the player a peaceful mind because they won't have to worry about the game crashing or bugging out.

Counter Strike is a great entry into the Counter Strike Series and is perhaps the father and master of all online first person shooter video games. Great Game and I totally recommend it."

13746,"So uhhmm I’m not that great of an aimer, nor a tactical person. I am also not a skilled player, but one thing I’ve learned from playing and spending hours upon hours of some part of my life is recoil. I am always amazed when professional counter-strike players or anybody who has good aim when they would frag from close range and get 3-4 kills and long range head shots. To me, these were obstacles that I have yet to pass. Considering the fact that I take my time to analyze and asked the ‘How to control recoil’ question on the gotfrag forums hasn’t got me to anywhere to be honest. Probably I’m just not fit for the game, but since I’m writing here anyway you might as well hear me out.

First things first, when you shoot, the bullet doesn’t exactly go to the middle of the crosshair. It doesn’t have a specific point where it will always hit. It always goes through in between the 4 lines of the crosshair. Having that said, the first bullet could go directly in the middle of the crosshair, to the upper, lower, left and right side of the crosshair line. However, the 2nd and 3rd bullet would follow the first bullet going diagonally to the left or diagonally to the right which I still can’t master for some reason. This normally happens when your bursting, but when your tapping it’s a different story. The bullets just go straight and does move diagonally a bit but just a little. Spraying does the same thing but after the 2nd(ak) or 4th(m4a1), it goes crazy. Sometimes it goes up to the left first to the right then to the left again or the opposite way. Sometimes it forms a number 9 pattern. You can try and ‘feel’ the recoil of your gun and move your mouse in the opposite direction to control your recoil. Hope that helps..

So please comment :)

14647,"The better Counter-Strike.

-The ease of wallbanging creates interesting gameplay mechanics, playing a strong position is riskier than playing a weaker off-angle.

-Buy the ammo, clip by clip. AWP is a costly weapon. But even with the cost, you should buy ammo for the wallbangs. But then you can't buy a helmet. These decisions are what makes every round interesting.

-Better hostages. Hostage maps aren't steal-the-flag but instead you have to move a blob of walking and talking pixels back to the spawn. This is very buggy, but allows for fun ideas such as using hostages as body shields and cover.

-Bunnyhopping. It's not 50/50 and you can get more speed than in CS:GO.

-Grenade hitboxes are 1 pixel. Why should they be any bigger?

-HE grenade explosions can wallbang. Why shouldn't they?

-Smokes are good ways to prevent visibility, but they let people walk through them.

-Head hitboxes aren't huge like in CS:S.

14744,"this is the epitome which has laid the foundation of every other fps game out there .other games wish to be like this .all your fps games which have been released in the past 10-15 years take their cues from cs 1.6 .it just deals with straight up raw aim. if you want to improve your aim accuracy and precision there is no better place to start. i have been playing this game on and off for 13 years and its one of ,if not the best even to this day!!and it was released in 2003. let that sink in. for me, no other game will be valued as much as this .GG :)"
14745,veri guda
14746,"I remember back in 2005 I was 7 years old and saw my older brother playing this game on his new PC, and all I can remember is how fun and interesting it looked and sounded while i was watching him play. Eventually he let me play a few rounds with BOTs and I immediately loved it. It was one of, if not the very first game i played on PC and the rest is history. Now I take a look at it in 2022 after 7000+ hours and I think it's finally time to say goodbye. CS has brought me some great memories but in the last year it has been kinda hard to enjoy it. One of the reasons is playing CS:GO, which made me better notice the flaws of the older game that sadly never got addressed. First of all VAC in 1.6 hasn't been updated since 2012, so the cheating problem is even worse than in CSGO. Then there's the bad net code and the even worse player models that teleport left and right every time a player moves and strafes. Not to mention the hitboxes and limited crosshair customization. But what bothered me most of all was the fucking scrolling(fast duck on mouse wheel), as if the noobs needed a trick to avoid shots and spam fire till they get a fucking hit. That thing was removed on Source for a reason, but enough of spitting on the game I claim to love so much. CS 1.6 will forever be one of my all time favorites but I just can't seem to enjoy it as much I used to. I'll still be droppin' in every now and then but for now it's time to retire. I fucking love CS !!!"

14760,"It's the original Counter-Strike, what else do I have to say?

One of the games that boosted the fps to where it is today and it deserves it's place as one of the best games of all time.

Nowadays it's mostly played by veterans (there's also the problem with hackers and such...) so you never quite fit in, but if you go in to play with friends you'll have some fun.

10/10 game but 6.5/10 experience for new players nowadays."

If you aren't into the competitive side there are multiple community servers with different fun modes for example, Jailbreak, this is a mode set in different prison maps, the idea is you have a couple of people playing as prison wardens and a lot of people playing the prisoners and the wardens pretty much make the prisoners do tasks and if the prisoners fail them they are killed, but as a prisoner you can disobey and escape to find weapons and escape!"

14796,"He-he, CS. ONE OF THE BEST GAMES !)"
14797,"If you like pure FPS with minimal eye sore or too much object, then Cs 1.6 is a must. 
Server with mods like De dust 24/7 / CS assultt 24/7 or Deathmatch is where all the fun is . 

If you want to play zombie mods then Left4Dead 2 is way better alternative as the Zombie mod is CS has become so much pay to win that it's unbearable and boring. 

Coming back to Cs.16 after so many years feels nolstalgic."

[b] Counter Strike 1.6-eh the beginning of a series of cs games, the very first and the best game at the moment, the second place is cs: source, and the most recent cs: go. Game on truth atmospheric good people not the that current in KS th, the good system protection from cheaters that allows play quietly and not strain about how that in the other team cheater which will you stupidly meschat, adminy servers which always are prepared come on aid here is the kind game that I love!

14863,"Really good but hard old school fps game. Requires lot of skill. Most off people i know that have played it and also have played cs:go or source game modes bhop and kz prefer it in 1.6 insted of cs:go. I like it way more as well, i don't even do kz or bhop in cs:go and it used to be something i'd do often in 1.6. There is not many players and there is no match making system so u gonna play on community servers and look for players on 3rd party apps, wich can be good since u will be playing with a lot of same people and make new friends. TeamSpeak 3 is big part of cs 1.6 community, no one uses discord tehere."

What's more, I've got a lot of fun there since I was play.

Server with mods like De dust 24/7 / CS assultt 24/7 or Deathmatch are where all the fun is . 

If you are looking for something fun, there are some zombie mods around with the most popular being Zombie Escape. 

Even after 20 years, the game still lit with countless servers all around the word, if you have any trouble finding server during log in, just search for it online :D 

Coming back to Cs.16 after so many years feels nostalgic."

14955,"This game is the reason why i made a Steam Account to begin with, used to be my favorite game till i was introduced to CS:GO, the basic of all players who have just started to play CS, they should slowly grow up simply by starting from this game. 
Is one of the best fps games ever. It's hard but definitely rewarding and for those who seek a casual experience in a shooter game! One of the most beautiful creations of ""GOD""! 
This game made me love online gaming and fps games, a piece of gaming history.

Reviews and thousands of hours speak for themselves.

Counter strike being among the most popular FPS game ever made, it was quite popular in my school days but alas, my PC didn't have good internet connection back then hence I was never been able to play over internet. But I used to create a LAN to play it. It was fun! This game is still relevant for those who don't have a powerful PC or laptop but still want to play and compete online with other players across the globe. I now have a gaming laptop (HP Pavilion laptop having 8th gen Core i7 processor with SSD & 24GB DDR4 RAM with 4GB Nvidia Graphics card) which is way more than what this measely fellow requires but I still can't resist myself playing this gem from time to time."

15016,"I've never been a fan of CS, I've never understood all the mass that are able to move (and it's admirable), moreover, as a gameplay point of view doesn't add anything new. 

In my opinion, the only positive thing that this game brings, is the ability to allow the community to let the imagination flow, allowing the users to play football, golf or any sport in certain servers, which is nice."

15061,"[h1]Counter-Strike[/h1]

[i]Counter-Strike[/i] (also referred to as [i]Counter-Strike 1.6[/i]) is a multiplayer, first-person shooter, and the first title of a game series with same name. It was initially developed as a modification for [i]Half-Life[/i], which was developed and officially released in year 2000 by [i]Valve Corporation[/i].

Rating (out of 10):
- [b]Graphics (inc. VFX) :[/b] 3.5
- [b]Music (inc. SFX) :[/b] 5
- [b]Content :[/b] 9
- [b]Controls :[/b] 8
- [b]Gameplay :[/b] 7.5

Let me start off by saying that I grew up with [i]Counter-Strike[/i], and it was one of the only games I played as a child. So, in reality I have probably way over 1000 hours in the game all together (including hours played on my old account), so don’t let these 10 hours fool you!

It’s an old game and its graphics have not aged too well. So, if you’re looking for a shooter with good visuals [i]Counter-Strike 1.6[/i] is definitely not the right game for you. 

There isn’t much music in the game, but the main theme is really good and very nostalgic. Sound effects, like reloading or pulling out of weapons are very satisfying, which is a very nice feature for any shooter. 

Originally, the game only really has 2 game modes, which are decided by the map you’re playing on. These modes are the classic Search and Destroy and Hostage Rescue. I will not get into the details of what the teams have to do in either of these game modes as it is very simple and self-explanatory. The reason why I gave a 9 in the “Content” category is because there is an abundance of community servers with different game modes like DM, Zombies, Surfing etc. The fact that players can modify the game and create their own game modes, weapons, models gives [i]Counter-Strike[/i] a lot of content.

Overall, I enjoy the game. It is a good competitive shooter with easy, nice feeling controls. However, after playing the new [i]CS:GO[/i] and other titles like [i]Battlefield[/i] I found the shooting in [i]Counter-Strike 1.6[/i] to be really difficult and hard to get used to. When I last played the community seemed to still be quite active, so you will be able to find servers with a bunch of players to play against. There are many better shooters available on the market, and I would not pick [i]Counter-Strike 1.6[/i] over its newer, and better brother [i]Counter-Strike:Global Offensive[/i].

If you played [i]Counter-Strike 1.6[/i] as a child, I would definitely recommend you pick it up during a sale to have that nostalgic experience and relive some of these memories. But, if you never played this original [i]Counter-Strike[/i], and you’re not interested in seeing the beginnings of the best series of competitive shooters then there is no point for you to play this game.

[u]I rate it [b]6.5/10[/b][/u]"
15062,"Counter-Strike is a pretty decent tactical multiplayer Half-Life mod—I can sorta see what the hubbub's been about for the past 20 years, especially considering that there was nothing like this when it first came out—but the online is currently a shitfight. Almost every server is full of modded-in assets, rules, and maps, so it's pretty difficult to get a sense of what the game is supposed to be like, and most of them are empty, to boot. If you can get a bunch of friends around to play it with you in a private server, I can see that being fun, but looking for matches online as a beginner is a fool's errand."
15063,nice game
15064,1.6 will always be the real CS.... AMAZING 20 YEARS LATER AND ITS STILL BOMB AF

Lasst all eure Finger von Hawaii, spielt cs 1.6!"
15076,"I'm sure at one point this game was amazing, I have no doubt. However, there is no way I can see to play this game online in its original form. All servers are in Spanish, and for some reason are hosted in Venezuela. I cannot recommend this game simply because it's unplayable if you were looking for a vanilla experience. I hope I'm wrong and someone can point me somewhere that allows me to play is in its original form. Until then, I cannot recommend this game."
15077,These graphics suck. This game sucks.
15078,If you still play this game then you simply crave for you childhood!
15079,this game can go for dirt cheap but the game is sooooooo goood 10/10

15083,"The game is pretty old, but it does not mean that the game is already outdated. 
A lot of people are playing the game at the moment. Some people think it is better than CS:GO.
Previously, everyone played in cs1.6 and held tournaments on it, and there was no such toxic audience as in cs:go.
Initially, this game was a modification to the Half-life game, and only then the modification was transformed into a game.The game does not have such a plot.

The Counter-Strike gameplay takes place in the format of a multi-round match between two teams of players, one of which plays the role of “terrorists” and the other plays the role of counter-terrorism special forces; Before the start of each match, players select a “map” on which the battle will take place. A team can achieve victory in the round by simply killing all opponents or completing certain tasks that may differ for different cards. At the beginning of each round, players can buy weapons and auxiliary equipment for game currency;
At the end of each round, players receive a certain amount of virtual money, which they can use to purchase more powerful and efficient weapons in the next round.Please note that there is no donation in the game, as in CS: GO, except that it is present on private servers
The shooting physics here is very good, but this is a distant year 2000 and the graphics at the time of 2000.And here, in addition, there are much fewer players using third-party programs.

In general, the game justifies its price, I really liked the game"
15084,F*ck yeah I am recommend this game)

15090,masterpiece
15091,One of the best game I've ever played but the only thing that is making people lose interest in the game is the amount of hackers in it. Valve have to fix on how to remove as much hackers as posible or make the game unhackable(?).
15092,"My name is odinN, and I recommend this game that must play everyone!"
15093,well this game is masterpiece!
15094,"Counter-Strike has received extremely high critical acclaim and gained immense popularity among players, including as one of the most popular eSports disciplines in the 2000s."

15106,The best cs of all time trust me
15107,This is good game. Just needs Updates. Or new game.
15108,"Awful network code. Everything stutters and hits barely register despite having less than 30 ping. The graphics are old and cute, but it's not worth suffering the awful old-school netcode. Play it for a few minutes for nostalgia, then delete it...

Interestingly enough, CS Source provides that perfect ""CS 1.6"" nostalgia with old-school graphics and fast-paced deathmatches, but it actually has good networking. Try CS Source instead if you have it! I got both in a bundle, and will never play CS 1.6 again. It was good for its time back in ancient times... but today it's just painful."

15155,"A classic game, my childhood is here.

I wish i could play the old Counter Strike 1.5 with bots again."
15156,"Counter-Strike (CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists battle to perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking, assassination) and counter-terrorists try to prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first game, Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification (""mod"") for Half-Life and designed by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le and Jess ""Cliffe"" Cliffe before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.

That original game was followed by Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. In November of that year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released eight months after Condition Zero, Source was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.[1] The fourth game in the main series, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released by Valve in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[2]

There have been several community-made spin-off titles created over the years. These include the Online series, Neo, and Nexon: Zombies."

I would recommend if anyone wants this game, then they should get it on the steam sales. I actually paid for the Counter Strike Complete Bundle on sale for $1.28, which was less than all the games bought individually combined on sale. Overall, I think it is worth an 8/10 for me!"

Even 20 years later, there are still people who play this game. Truly a 10/10. GoldSrc ftw."

15242,"i absolutely love this game, really fun to play, not hard at all to handle, no toxicity, no skins, in my personal opinion, this and cs source are the most perfect counter strike can get, i do recommend this to people that are either looking for a new first person shooter, or just simply sick and tired of csgo"

Apart from having the so called ""nostalgia vibe"" around it, Counter-Strike also provided me with the old school setting, proving me that it takes a lot of time, dedication and commitment to be better at this game, moreover showing that this games is still fun to play even to this day.

15540,"""Counter-Strike is a MOD for Half-Life."" 
Overview
Is there anyone who hasn’t played a Counter-Strike game or even heard about it? All the elements of true competition and sweat-soaked-shirt anxiety are blended into an incredibly entertaining multiplayer game. Counter-Strike started as just another modification for Half-Life but then it quickly transformed into a full-blown retail game and one of the core games of Valve, the popular company behind popular titles such as Half-Life 2, Portal and Team Fortress.
An outstanding multiplayer game, Counter-Strike has revolutionized the way in which first person shooters are played online. Let’s review this superb game in our quick article, as you will easily see the reasons why you should get this game now!
Installation
So you want to download and install Counter-Strike? The first thing you should know about this game is that it comes with Valve’s distribution system, the popular Steam platform. A broadband platform for the delivery and management of digital content, Steam also works whilst you’re in the game and its main purpose it to deliver all of your desired games as soon as possible to your PC. As a result, the setup kit of Counter-Strike measures around 370MB in size, and you will also be getting the Steam platform on your system. In addition, Steam has a ton of features and advantages, such as automatic updates, Steam-Only special offers that are a lot cheaper that the retail counterparts, chatting with friends and much, much more. In order to be able to run the game, you will need at least a system equipped with a 500 MHz processor, 96MB Ram and a 16MB video card. In this day and age, these system requirements are ridiculously low so you should be fine.
Interface
From a visual point of view, the game certainly doesn’t disappoint as it boasts some of the most realistic gun models of any available shooter out there. What is more, a smooth look and feel is created by the game’s graphics which sport good environmental textures that look realistic and visually appealing maps. The Half-Life graphics engine is utilized to its fullest potential and it certainly shows. The lightning is good; there are a lot of skins you can download and that look great. Overall, Counter-Strike is a beautiful multiplayer game that you shouldn’t miss. Let’s move on the fantastic and addicting game play of Counter-Strike!
Pros
Although a single-player component is implemented into CS, this game is all about visceral, online action. A game of cat and mouse is basically being played between a squad of counter-terrorists and a terrorist group. The planting of a bomb at a specific location or holding a group of hostages are your goal as a terrorist; the duty of a counter-terrorist is to defuse the above mentioned bomb or save the unlucky hostages. In order for victory to be achieved, as an alternative to the previous mentioned goals, all of the players on the opposing side must be taken out of action. An action lover's dream, the multiplayer matches in CS are fast and brutal as one single, well-placed shot to the head means instant death. Many have called it the perfect mix between realistic damage and fast-action. It is very important for the team to actually work as a team because most often, taking the lone wolf approach will get you killed.
The main aspects that make CS so fun are the team-based tactics and selection of weapons. A wide variety of accurately modeled shotguns, pistols, assault rifles, submachine guns and sniper rifles are provided to the player, besides the usual knife and assorted grenades. It is a terrific mix and the best thing about it is that every weapon has its own stats and unique characteristics. Thus, replay value is guaranteed as you try your best to master all of the available weapons. In the sound department, CS doesn’t disappoint and offers realistic gun and environmental sounds.
Cons
At first, there are a couple of features and game play mechanics that are frustrating, such as buying your weapons at the start of every round but, in time, you will quickly realize that they become enhancements to the online multiplayer gaming. You can also bind keys to a specific buying action in order to speed up the purchase process.
Alternatives
Alternatives to Counter-Strike include the following games: Unreal, Battlefield, Call of Duty and more.
Conclusion
In a nutshell, CS is a satisfying, intense and fast paced game that is very addictive! With such a huge user base to date, you should certainly try it for yourself if you haven’t been to the world of Counter-Strike!"

15670,"Counter-Strike essentially kick-started what Steam is today. From a simple update delivery platform to now the largest PC games resource. Whether it's community hubs for games, achievements, this game pretty much enabled it all. From internet cafés, to eventually being able to play at home, this game was a cultural shift indeed. The dust map alone continues to this day to be played nonstop in successive versions of the game and for good reason. If you want a game to improve your reaction times and help build team confidence, look no further than CS."

16000,The first ever PC shooter that I have gotten my hands on back in 2007. I am so glad since that year to be playing Counter Strike. CS 1.6 is honestly the start of it all to CSS and of course the most popular CS of all time being CS:GO. I recommend trying this game if you have never because this CS is one of my most favorite.

You will meet better player in CS 1.6 as in CSGO.
If you dont care about graphics/skins and more about the gameplay/fun, then this game could be your alternative.
As i mentioned, you will find better players, that means they know how to play this game and your start wont be easy, so take your time dont ragequit and you will learn the tricks and tips from the wise old friendly player community.
I had fun with a group with older people who showed me a lot tricks, still some tricks you need to figure out by yourself.
If you buy it in the sale you wont regret it.

This is my first review and its on a other language, please have mercy on me"

16028,Despite being so old cs 1.6 still holds up even today. Many servers are active with players and they also have VAC security and active admins to ban any cheaters. 10/10 recommended.
16029,This is a good game.
16030,<3
16031,Literally the best game of all time. Still has an active community after 20 years. If you've never played it - its 100% worth buying.

16057,It’s a good game for the price if you want good FPS.
16058,"I only have 30 minutes on steam for some reason, but don't get me wrong. I installed Steam because I had this installed way back before Steam. The amount of hours I put in this game may go over the 10s of thousands. I am talking about the year 2000, in which I bought the game Half-Life and then noticed I had some additional CD-ROMS in my package. It was a box with different games (half-life mods) so I went to install Counter-Strike after that and then I played it for 5 years straight. Fell in love with it immediately. Made some friends online too (Way before the time of social media). I see this game still as the game that started it all for me. It is the reason I still game today. I am not saying you should play this game, as it is very old, but it was one of the first games that allowed custom maps creations, skins, mods and additional server-specific stuff... I had some great fun and some angry German kids I played with back then. Boy, that was fun... It was also a time when you never encountered Russians in-game. I think during this time, Russians did not have access to the internet that easily maybe."

It only contains servers or in other words multiplayer. What a waste of money. I bought the game thinking I could play single player with bots in the assault map, but it seems that i need to install a patch or modd it?????? I did not pay steam for half a gama. In fact I am going to download the game online for free instead of with steam. Is there any way I can get my money back."

I have been a Counter-Strike fan for as long as I can remember. I love the way the game plays and can never get enough of it. I noticed that the Valve complete pack was on sale so I bought it again. When I opened the game, memories came flying back. The game is perfect. However, I know this sounds crazy, this game needs official matchmaking. I feel that would bring a lot of people back. I am tired of clicking on servers that download millions of files and have modded games. Overall, perfect game in every way."

16268,"Visually the game will not disappoint...... While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun."

Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park

16634,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:

I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.

Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.

I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.

I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though."

During this time world was evolving, nobody had mobile phones,  best internet was 250 kbps dail-up, Napster was life, msn messenger was life ( google, facebook, ebay don't exist), DVD don't exist used to have VHS movie of The Last of the Mohicans and tape cassette of Metallica justice for all... ,  . ..  I was playing  cs 1.5 . . . suddenly world technology evolved so huge and so fast . . . . Then my online gaming addiction started with this game . . . . I used to be so pro because wallhack, aimbot those shit didnot even exist when I started everyone was clean and geniune, whoever was smart and practised shooting aim and was clam were the ones that ruled the game, I used go rule this game . . . then more people started playing it became worldwide and like always game was ruined with you know what human are best at doing . . . destroying the actual genuine fun. although bad things came with it good things also came and esports was born then slowly slowly it grew bigger little by little now. . . im a old man and I see esports so huge , my kids playing all these competitive games makes me smile and sometimes I wonder . . . I was born too early or else I would be one of the world renowned pro player or maybe technology and esport was huge during my time. . .  anyway this game is a must play for anyone who wants a taste of the orginal godfather founder of online game, esports and competitive scene. . . .  I will make my dream come true one day and kids don't do drugs . . esp Heroin, I've seen it destroy lives . . do whatever you want in life but never touch drugs, once you do it it will always be in your life no matter what you do or become, one is too many thousand is never enough. have fun playing this game and keep dreaming big but also work towards your dream."

16938,excelent gamesa
16939,"A classic and old but gold game. Worth the try, altough if you are coming from CS:GO you will need some time getting used to it."
16940,"Still gets updates...
Wow..."

16945,"Its old , but gold!"
16946,"Back then, it was a perfect game. I've played Counter Strike for days.

In 2019, its unplayable. There is no servers anymore.

Well, time flies..."
16947,God knows how many hours we all would have if we counted our playtime while we played pirated versions in early 2000s :D
16948,Greatest FPS ever

16950,good
16951,.
16952,"og counter-strike

16953,best game
16954,This is the most Counter strike Ever i also like Counter strike condition zero!!!. 5 stars
16955,"I mean it's fucking Counter Strike.
"
16956,Best game ever!
16957,best childhood
16958,"that is bullshit
( csgo is better )"
16959,"best game u have ever played, but it lost its best servers, the 2012 servers, some of you probably remember that period."
16960,I now it is an old game but it's still fun.The community server is still alive and i love this game <3
16961,OK
16962,the best game of all time
16963,"Still fun old but gold game ;)

oyun hala eski keyifi veriyor oynarken arada arkadaşlarla girip oynamak için gayet güzel eski yılları yad ediyoruz :)

16964,Very fun OG game!
16965,"thank you, very cool!"
16966,(Y)
16967,.
16968,You gotta love it
16969,"It's a classic. Anyone who likes Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has probably played this at least once. If not, you should try it. Of course, it was the #1 FPS game a long time ago, but today it is down in the bottom of the charts. I don't like the controls too much, same goes for the graphics. It isn't terrible, but average at most. I would recommend it a lot if you're going to play on community servers, though. One thing you should download it for is the community. Unlike on CS:GO, it is a lot more friendly, has a ton of different community servers with fun and enjoyable gamemodes. I'd say the game deserves an 8/10 after we add up all the controls and graphics problems."
16970,GG
16971,"is amazing
"
16972,"If I would've known I could've gone pro when I was younger, I would've tried a lot harder. If not at games, at least at something.
This game was amazing. And I don't  play it any more because it's so old, and the last time I tried to play there were like Warcraft servers giving out XP and you could buy powerups and whatnot.

Anyway, best game ever. Except not anymore, since there is a newer version.
Best game of it's time, and one of the most impactful games in history."
16973,ddd
16974,"legendary game,I really like this game and it's not because I like shooters, it's first and foremost because it’s legendary"

16976,terbaik la rev
16977,игра которая до сих пор живёт без обновлений Valve
16978,Recommend
16979,Much good game I like
16980,"There are still 1.6 dedicated communities, but the game can only see traces of it's previous glory.

Also there are multiple issues that haven't been fixed for years:
It has weird bugs with player models, making it really hard to hit people on purpose and not so hard to kill them randomly. Also has bugs with scroll ducking (it makes sounds to be played at different location than you are), which renders one of the core aspects of the game useless."
16981,Great community and awesome people to play with
16982,always <3
16983,GAME iam play since CS 1.3 :D play with BOT and LAN with my friend school :D

17024,...
17025,very good graphics
17026,"The famous Counter-Strike 1.6, in its time was more than a game for every person who enjoyed it, it was a feeling of joy to play with friends so agreeable, good times that will never return, by the will and the coexistence and to exist and the admiration of a tremendous complexity of several years of points of connection between friends who have already returned to play again, just to remember the times that never come back, I never forget those who passed me!"

17056,"haha!!! i'm writing a review more then 10 years after i first started playing! how is that for recommended games? :D

to be honest before playing CS i always enjoyed PC games or PS games... but i was never a Gamer... CS took me in to a whole new world of gaming with club servers and league competitions in my own country (long gone by now haha).

i think there's was a certain time where it seemed almost everyone was playing this game... and this theory confirms itself everytime CS comes up at a conversation haha.

i've tried playing CS Source a bit after it came out and went straight back to CS 1.6 ... haven't played new ones... but i still play from time to time Spring Cleaning Sale made me take another run at this as this was the first game i had on Steam ;) and thank you Steam for that!

CS is an amazing game... where you wanna just play at war or find a server with serious ppl and play the actual missions.
Had some very exciting moments in some long forgotten maps (cs_747 for example). 

anyways if you never tried it. you have to. 
if you tried newer version - just see where this game came from ;)

nothing more to say about this game other than the 76.8 counted hours are nothing as i was playing since the last day of 1.4 - Steam didn't even exist yet ;)

This game is definitly a milestone in my Gaming experience. 

PLAY IT ! 
just make sure you have time before starting because you're not gonna stop :)"

17064,"People are still playing, and it is still nearly just as fun as it was all those years ago. I don't think this game will ever truly die."
17065,It's the best game of my LIFE!!!!!
17066,Old is gold
17067,This is where it all started.
17068,"Still good even to this day

17075,"a game to live on for centuries, and a true classic.
Pros:
+The classic CS,  can run on your old pc, toaster, AC, cat, and your grandma's nokia.
+A good oldschool community that just gathers to have some nice ol' nostalgic fun.
+The game that started the best competitive shooter series out there.

Cons:
-buggy on newer and higher end systems. sometimes doesnt launch for me on win7 ultimate.


The game is worth it's full price, but I STRONGLY suggest getting this with the complete valve pack during the Steam Summer Sale, due to it being only about $1-2 then"

17101,"1. In the beginning God created Half-Life.
2. The Half-Life was masterpiece and had great multiplayer, but God wasn't satisfied.
3. Then God said, ""Let there be mod,"" and there was mod.
4. God saw that the mod was good, so he divided the mod from the Half-Life.
5. God named the mod ""Counter-Strike"". Evening passed, and morning came. This was the first day.
6. Then God said, ""Let's play Counter-Strike until the end of this week"".

A classic shooter for sure. One which withstood the test of time for a long while.
I cannot really recommend it to anyone aged 25 (or below) right now, since it's a dated shooter, but it has been really good ""back in my day"".
I'm offering it a high rating due to eternal respect, but there are surely better shooters out there in these days.

A CHECKLIST
[/h1]

✔️ Playable on GeForceNOW. Thank you developers!
✔️ Offered a lot of opportunities to play, while maintaining a simple playstyle 
✔️ You could play it offline, self-host it, or play online. 
✔️ Online servers had good anti-cheat systems in general.
✔️ Offered practically infinite modding capabilities (from UI, Maps, to custom abilities, etc.).
✔️ Aesthetics weren't that bad for it's time, nor were the sound effects.
✔️ Easy to jump into, hard to perfect. This allowed for a greater pool of players to experience the game. Many of which were hooked immediately.
✔️ An utterly exciting and addicting action game overall (especially for competitive players, due to the many ways in which they could showcase their skills).
✔️ No micro-transactions.
❌ No story, just pure action.
➖ It's probably going to be hard to find players nowadays on the online servers.
➖ It's also likely unmaintained, so as time goes by bugs may arise.

[h1]
MENTIONS
[/h1]

🕘 Release date: Nov, 2000
🕘 I've played it in: Jan, 2010
🕘 Disregard the hundreds of hours displayed here, I've likely played thousands more in non-steam versions, back in the day.

[h1]
GOOD TO KNOW
[/h1]

⚠️ I strongly recommend self-hosting the game and playing it with a group of friends instead of playing online if you haven't played it yet and decide to give it a shot.
⚠️ Community Rating at time of review: Overwhelmingly Positive

[h1]
CONTROVERSIAL OPINIONS CHECK

EXTRA THOUGHTS
[/h1]

🔙 Once CS:GO released, I've bought it immediately and gave if many chances. Unfortunately, I feel that for me it's a completely different game. One to which I wasn't able to adapt. The ""Counter-Strike fever"" died down for me once people started moving to the latest version of the game (Global Offensive).

17383,"The original first person shooter from back in the day when this type of play was unseen.
I think it goes without saying that it is a must for every counter strike enthusiast new or old and never goes out of style.
The true shooting arena to hone skills, add a challenge or just hang out with your buds.
Newer versions may offer more updated graphics, new maps and other angles but at the end of the day: If you cannot rock cs 1.6 then the other additions are just distractions and you are not at your true potential.
Me loves....

17452,"Counter Strike - the legendary game that started the beast of a series.

Many people's  first online multiplayer shooter and a true pioneer for future online shooters.

Must have been great fun and fresh during it's release but sadly by today's standards its just too dated, your better off playing source as it just feels a lot smoother. Gameplay just feels super clunky. 

Still has an avid player base

3/10 - fun to go back to see how it all started but has aged badly"

17540,"Giving this game a score less than 10, will result in shame. Play this game, then play a modern FPS multiplayer game, and you will see that this game was the innovator. A deliverer of fine quick reflex shooting and an unlimited skill learning curve. A provider of that instant gratification kill which was solely based on skill. There are no perks, levels, experience points to give you the edge.
There are no cheap weapons, no grenade launchers or rocket launchers xD"

- Bad performance even on a high-end PC
- Buggy

17590,"Counter-Strike will remain the best team shooter for me. No other game was as catchy as the good old 1.6.

17599,"This game is where boys became men, literally and physically. Don't let my hours in this game deceive you, I have sunk thousands of hours in mostly non-steam CS. I actively played from 2003 to 2015, literally elementary school to university graduation. All the mods and game modes, muscle memory, community leadership, making maps; I've done it all and have no regrets. I can draw the layout of every original map like it was a place I've actually been to. It make's me sad to watch the population of this gem die out by its 'successor'; CS:GO. According to the steam community-hub, there still exists a player-base of 20k on a weekend and 7k on a slow day as I write this review. This is just the people playing steam, not non-steam CS. It will never top the daily 500k+ player-base of CS:GO. 

But hey.. CS:GO will never give me the fun that CS 1.6 gave me.

P.S. You can get this game for less than a dollar when it's on sale, but be warned... when you join a custom server, you are downloading strange files onto your computer. Some files may mess with your current game files causing problems such as auto-connecting to strange servers. Don't worry, there are guides and fixes for these issues should you come across them. :)"

17616,"It all started back in 2007. 
10 year old me liked to compete and liked video games in general so I installed the pirated version like a true Slav. The game was so big that me and my friends skipped school to play this masterpiece day in and day out. We used to pull all nighters every weekend and binge on the game like it was our entire life. Not to mention my obsession with professional teams back in the day, I watched every single Heaton tips and tricks video, watched every single tournament on Youtube and played the game like my life depended on it. 

I got into my first fights because of this game, damn hackers and scrollers. I was a hacker myself for some time xD and I got banned a lot. Whatever happened in my life I would go back to play this masterpiece. When ever I felt down I would play the game, first thing I would do in the morning was playing this game, and the last thing before bed. Who can forget those long hot summer nights spent on Teamspeak playing Counter strike. Who can forget those summer afternoons when your crotch couldn't breathe from all the excess sweat while you're fragging noobs. Who can forget those Zombie servers when Casual just got boring from all the skill we had xD, and Deathrun and Surf servers, OMG. 

And if somebody asks me do I regret all the time I spent playing this masterpiece I would reply NO. This game is my nostalgia, this game is my childhood and most importantly this game is everything I used to be. The only thing I feel sorry for is that I didn't bought the game on Steam so I truly know how many hours I've put into this masterpiece."

I can't run Global Offensive on my PC, but that's fine because this game runs perfectly and is far from obsolete. The playerbase is still huge and minimal bugs are present. I would opt for CSGO if you can run it, but if you're in the situation I am, this game does the job, and well."

17690,Words can't describe how happy this game made me when i was a kid! You need to have this game in your library!
17691,"Counter-Strike is a FPS game developed by Valve in 2000. The teams are divided up into terrorists and counter-terrorists. Counter Terrorists are supposed to defuse the bomb while Terrorists are supposed to detonate it, simple as that.

The original CS is known for its most popular map, Dust. If you haven't heard of Dust, than you're living under a rock. It's on CS:CZ, CS:Source, and CS:GO. It's everywhere in the Counter-Strike franchise.

It's just a multiplayer game pretty much, like the other games I've reviewed recently. Has anybody noticed I've reviewed a ton of Valve games this month/week? Anyway, the game has the same controls as every Valve game, complete with a developer console.

This game is one of the more pointless to review in the series since there is nothing to talk about but let me just talk about the weapons for a bit. The guns are pretty well designed. Not ugly looking, pretty powerful too.

The character design is really what you'd expect from a GoldSrc game. Nothing special but it's normal for what you'd see from Valve until 2004. It's just alright for the time I guess. The character design is improved in Counter-Strike: Source though.

Final score: 92%

I like the game but I don't play it too much, I'm surprised anybody even still plays the original Counter-Strike. I'm glad people still do. But it's definitely not the best game ever."

17843,"This is the original Counter-Strike. I will be listing both upsides and downsides.

Upsides:
- It's a classic
- Many Terrorist and Counter-Terrorist exclusive weapons
- The in-game sounds are very satisfying
- Like any other GoldSRC engine games, it can run on a literal potato

Downsides:
- No bots included with the game, making the game harder to learn with newer players
- A lot of servers are empty or have a very small amount of players

That's all I could think of.

A great game that, thanks to different modes, never stops bored and even though it has something behind it, it is one of the most played games of the world and I strongly recommend it to anyone who has not tried it yet.

After 9 years in this game I have to say that the game still has something to offer.
It's about having fun with charged friends with whom to play one great fun :)
Although most of my friends left years ago, I still like to play some bluffing mode once in the evening.

It's been over 10 years since my bumps in this game. She has become part of me. I'm so glad I had the chance to get to this game, to experience so much fun here, to get to know so many new people.

17912,Can't see your legs.
17913,"CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.

It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this ""Conga Line"" style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS."
17914,good
17915,"           When i was ten years old,i always went to Internet bar with my classmates after school.We played Counter-Strike together.Our favorite map was""cs_assault"",because we enjoyed hostage rescue.Even if we could't rescue hostages as successfully as Fuze,we were enjoyable and delighted.Today,some of my classmates play Rainbow Six,some of my classmates play Nekopara and some of them play Monster Hunter: World.If we have time,we will play cs:go together.We enjoy playing cs:go with a shout""Rush B,no stop"".
          So I appreciate Counter-Strike because it teaches me to play FPS and it shows me what the friendship is.Although it's obsolescent,as far as i am concerned,it's  immortal.

17950,"Ok, I have played EVERY Counter-Strike, over all, Source is my personal favorite, but let's give it's older brother some attention. Here is a review of Counter-Strike!

Brief Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The series began on Windows in 1999 with this game, Counter-Strike. Though, originally a modification for Half-Life, the rights to Counter-Strike, as well as the developers working on it, were acquired by Valve Corporation in 2000. Lets move on to the gameplay shall we?

The gameplay
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Counter-Strike series is an objective-based, multiplayer fps (First Person Shooter). Two opposing teams—the Terrorists and the Counter Terrorists—compete in game modes to complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or guarding hostages. You win money by winning the rounds, and with that money, you can buy weapons to defeat enemies faster, or slower. Killing the opposite teammates result in extra cash, but attempting to attack your teammates will result in punishments.

Pros
~~~~~
1. The community is regarded as less toxic, more friendly and mature, and over all chill people.
2. The most popular servers, have over 18 people, making it fun!
3. Its not free to play (because thats a pro I guess?)
4. It's a nice get together with friends!
5. Less horrendously bad microphone quality users
6. Better compatibility with lower end devices!
7. Better performance!   
8. It's just a great game honestly, it may have flaws, and may not be the greatest, but it built steam from ground 1. Putting, boxed copies into the dark, and allowing more people to enjoy this media we enjoy. This game, built steam. Thats a great accomplishment, and blows the cons out of the water. +1 point

Cons
~~~~~
1. People create infested servers, to rewrite your keybindings, and logs, making it so you can switch the keybinds again. And the normal keybinds take you to their place. (The only fixes, are to reinstall the game or search up ways to solve it, its pretty simple.)
2. It's players decreased dramatically since 1999. It makes sense, I don't think you'd actively finding people on an NES that much now.
3. I'm gonna say this bluntly, hitboxes / hitregisters are broken.
4. Valve Anti Cheat is broken. 

Final Judgement
+~+~+~+~+~+~+~
I give this game a solid 8/10. It has flaws yes, it hasn't aged perfectly but nor has alot of things that we still love. This is a definite recommendation, for any person that enjoys this franchise."

18009,"Before buying this game, you [b]MUST[/b] know:

I was playing online and after a while I got alerts for Trojans. I can’t believe I bought a game to get viruses.

2.	[b]The servers will install contents outside the CS game folder[/b]. So after uninstalling CS you will still have a lot of crap in the hard disk:
One example: I had to manually delete C:\prog…\steamapps\common\Half life 
because it was added by one of those servers to add custom mods (still there after CS uninstall).

Yes, I am asking for a reimbursement right now.

You can see about the trojans in Malwarebytes forums (I am not the only one reporting this, but I see that the post is half year old and the viruses are still there, so no action from any of the companies, CS or Steam):

18025,"Classic game, way ahead of it's time. Nobody really plays anymore, I miss the old CAL and CPL day's, It was awesome reading,watching or hearing about the Pro's of that time when it was fresh and still very competitive. But the day's of going to a PC Room after school and spending hours of CS on the weekend's were the best. Eventually I got CS 1.5 at home (which my computer at the time could barely handle lmao) I'll always love CS 1.6 (started playing at the tail end of 1.4) and the fun memories they give me when I think about those past times.  If anybody is playing CS for the first time (which I doubt, it's 2020 already), CSGO is great and that's what I'm currently on as is everybody else. Play 1.6 and maybe some Condition Zero as well just for the nostalgia and to see what It was like back in the day. CS 1.6 will always be Legendary. <3"

小学5年级的时候，我记得，那些偷偷跑到网吧里和小伙伴们打cs1.5的日子，这款游戏带给我的欢乐，让我对于这款游戏，痴迷。
初中开始混迹于各个混战服务器，才发现自己是多么的渺小，自己枪法稀烂，加上外挂横行，我甚至都要放弃它了。
到了高中，学业紧张，我就很少玩了。高考之后，和高中的朋友打了几把，觉得又有了兴趣。
同时，我接触到了kz。CS跳跃的精髓都在于此。那个时候，我发现，原来最适合我的，并不是杀戮。
大一大二，没日没夜地练习长跳，那时候数据就是一切，我已经到达了走火入魔的境界，大三，开始疯狂的在服务器里刷记录，记得那个时候在97club的积分到了第九位，非常有成就感。但是同时我发现自己的成绩一落千丈，自己变得颓废，变得孤独。
大四，开朗了许多。很努力学习的一年呢。这款游戏，我仍然没有放弃。
跳跃，没有极限。只有瓶颈。当我发现我不可思议的突破，我奇迹般的在一张地图上提升了哪怕0.1秒，给我带来的快乐，是无法形容的。这就是战胜了自己的感觉。那种永不言弃，突破极限，战胜自我的心情，就像昨天，在我的记忆里沸腾。。
现在我在海外，仍然在玩这款游戏，法国德国的跳跃服务器，还是有人在默默的练习。
我只想对它说，

18229,Nothing To Say !! Just To Complete Badges
18230,"2nd review, here is what I think about 1.6. Trust me, in my opinion this review looks a bit bad

Counter strike was launched back on 2000 and is the sucessor of Half-life 1. In end of 90 it starts with a half-life mod as known cs 1.0 and back on 2000, it starts to be sold, after several updates (take notes steam was created back on september 2003, they start to sell as CDs on your local gaming store before steam was created on 2003). Prove me wrong, but thats how it works.

Still surprising there is more than 10000 cs 1.6 players playing right now on 2018 every day. I guess the rumours are true tho.. cs 1.6 never dies. People who tells cs 1.6 is dying are basically people who came from csgo. No joke tbh

[H1]Pros[/h1]
Community is pretty active, more than 10000 people
Graphics cant be a big deal, but hey. Its made from gold source engine so give them a break. Most people like me loves gold source engine games.
Tons of mods on gamebanana to test weapons and free sprays.
Custom gamemodes created by community if people is interested  like deathmatch, zombie escape and more.
For those who never heard of counter-strike, this game offers you ""planting the bomb"" maps and hostage rescue maps.
Idk why but valve update this game somehow (rarely because they are focus on new games like dota and csgo)

[H1]Neutral[/h1]
Without having sale, game costs like 8 euros, but I recommend buying on sale like summer or winter sale because game drops like 1 euro

[H1]Cons[/h1]
5% of servers contains trojan virus and cracked servers.
45% of people buys steam accounts when buying/selling/trading accounts is against steam subscriber agreement and valve takes no notice to terminate those accounts (every server i join, 40/45% or people has 14 to 15 year accounts at least 3 games and less than 100 hours). If you wanna play 1.6, just buy the game on steam store and create a new account which is completely free

[H1]Mark[/h1]
7/10

Buy the game on holiday sale because if you spend 8 euros without being on sale, months later ur gonna regret it."

18261,"I used to play Counter-Strike from the CD I bought. At that time, I haven't discovered internet. And no bots. So I ended up playing alone, doing literally nothing.

Sometimes, I explored the map a bit and wondered what's beyond the fences and locked gates designed to keep players in the map. I also wondered how would people go in and out. Back then. I haven't discovered noclip, but I discovered free look. So I looked beyond them. What's out there? Nothing. Yep, nothing.

Later, I bought Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. That game goes to another review [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141201307/recommended/80]here[/url].

10 years later, I discovered the internet. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy being killed by players.

Okay this game is an absolute classic Alot of OG CS  players may have started with this game even though it has been a long time this game is still great and worth playing in my opinion. However this game may not be for everybody if you never played it before you may not enjoy it, it doesn't hurt to try though. You can pick this game up pretty cheap on sale. Now the player base is not what it used to be but there's still plenty of people playing it, matter of fact there are tons of servers that get filled up daily. I personally don't play it anymore but from time to time it is nostalgic. If you are going to buy it i recommend trying Surf,Zombie,Deathrun or Zombie Builder Servers."

18302,The best First-Person Shooter of all time.
18303,"I mostly bought this game, when it was 9,99€ because all of my friends had it and I wanted a moderator job, and I needed Counter-Strike on Steam. I bought it, probably on a bad timing, due to the price reduction a few weeks later, but this game is a lot of fun, especially is your computer doesn't handle CS:GO, like my own. This game is an instant classic for many, and I see why, the gameplay is pretty good, a lot of different game modes to choose from, if you don't want much of a shooting game all of the time. But there is 2 problems in buying this game at this time: The rise of CS:GO, now that it is free and all, and the country that you live in.

Allow me to explain: I am from Portugal, a country where CS:GO is quite prevalent and basically everyone from my school that plays PC, usually plays CS:GO. Although one day, we all played Counter-Strike on the school computers, and they loved it, and some play it a bit more regularly, instead of just on class taking the piss. Now what am I trying to say? Basically, in some countries, Counter-Strike is sadly, out of trend. In 100% of the time, you will play this online, but there are some countries where, heck, there aren't even any servers of Counter-Strike. But if you live in countries like Russia, Servia, Eslovaquia or even Portugal, you will find a lot of servers, and some might be even full, and I love that they don't let Counter-Strike die. You can make friends, and have a lot of fun, like me, when 95% of my friends are Counter-Strike buddies. But in some, even some servers do not exist, and you need to go to Romanian servers, and so on. But if you want servers from your country, sometimes, you will have a hard time.
Now for an ups and downs of this game:

Ups:
- Classic game;
- Tons of fun;
- Friends are nice, although some comunities can be cancerous or just full of kids;

Downs:
- Is kinda dying;
- In some countries, servers don't exist, and you must go to other countries servers;
- Bots aren't a thing here, and you must install a mod for it, hurting gameplay quite a bit;
- Pretty expensive, for it's worth, I guess. Depends on the country and on the community;

I would really recomend, if you're a Valve fanboy like myself, to buy this game, but on a discount. On Black Friday, it was at 81 cents, and that is a bargain for this neat game. I bought it for 10 euros on January so, sucks to be me :C
Just wait for X-Mas to buy this game, and you can have a lot of fun.
Have fun and happy shooting! ^^"

18347,"[h1]Retro-Review[/h1] 
Multiplayer games tend to die off after some time. Despite that Counter-Strike surprisingly survived for very long. I assume mainly because Counter-Strike Source´s and Global Offensive´s gunplay was so much different (And Condition Zero felt more like an expansion) from what people are used to and they kept staying. Especially with the latter whos modding scene was rather weak to the previous games.I tought for now i should check the game out and see if its worth playing today.

[u] Gameplay[/u] 
The ""main"" gametype, the meat of the game is a small scale(mostly 6 vs 6) bomb defusal pvp. One group is a terrorist who has to plant and protect the bomb until the time runs down or the enemy team has died and the other group must defuse it. There are some gameplay elements that make this game stand out like you have to buy the equipment, stronger or some equipment in general is more expensive, death will reset your equipment back to the pistol after each round. This creates a tactical economy as some people can save for different weapons while other buy some semi-expensive things to have somewhat of an advantage. If you spent all your money and still lost, tough luck as the enemy will have even better equipment next round.

Additionally the aiming is very different from what people are used to. Weapons spray a lot, creating a high skill ceiling with additional gameplay elements controlling spray patters, burst, economy, map layout and so on. While you can easily practice aiming in casual deathmatch, its personally not the mode i really like to play the game a lot.

Altough there is a problem. Counter-Strike transformed from a small scale bomb defusing game with a very unique movement and gunplay to mainly a deathmatch map game. Most of the servers have atleast 32 slots and there is a high change you will either find solely dust2 maps and if you are lucky bomb defusal or for some reason zombie mode. There are some rare 6 vs 6 servers but its pretty hard to find a proper regular bomb defusal game without private groups and for the latter i am too lazy to join one as i boot the game once in a blue moon for nostalgias sake.

Personally its not really what i liked about this game. The game now is mostly filled with russians and people from brazil altough which in itself is a reason to solely check the game out. You probably will find always atleast a couple of servers with people so the game is far from dead but if you are not into regular team deathmatch the game is definety not for you.

[u]Aestethics[/u] 
Altough this is more a nostalgia thing, i really like the sound design. Every weapon and sound effect has been engraved into my brain. You can always hear which type of weapon someone uses, even if you play it for the first time you can pretty much guess what kind of gun you where hearing across the room.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR [/u] 
its hard to tell if its worth checking out Counter-Strike in 2022. Except out of curiousity or for a lan party. Most servers focus on the deathmatch mode i personally dont like that much and those few that focus on the great bomb defusal mode are often empty or private. You can join a matchup group but if youre new you will get stomped easily. Generally its still a good game with a still standing playerbase and thats the reason i can recommend it to this day."

18354,This game is not dead. I have a lot of memorys whit this game. When i was a kid i used to play this game i had a lot of fun and then I started to play more seriously. If you wanted to play 5vs5 u need to call you're frends to play. It wasn't like in CS:GO that u have a matchmaking. And the game was played whit all heart. Sometimes I comeback to this game and see that there is a lot of players that play this game. Like i said this will never be dead.
18355,"A great Classic game that can be fun to play from time to time. 

BUT - This game is a major security consern. 

Since thjis game is allowing direct FTP downloads from server to client some administrators use this to DL trojans on client machines. be careful on what server you play on.

18542,"As being one of the substance of aggressive gaming, Counter-Strike has always offered a high ability roof and ongoing interaction that just needs two things: collaboration and expertise. 

Every one of the instruments expected to take care of business are given since the start. All you need to do with said devices is realize how to utilize them. Furthermore, that takes a large number of hours. 

Collaboration is required constantly. It's constantly magnificent when proficient players do keen methodologies to defeat the foe group. Explosives are ideal for this. 

Weapons work distinctively contrasted with other first individual shooters. Backlash is high, has an alternate example for each weapon, and doesn't run with your crosshair. You additionally can't run, go inclined, point down locales with scopeless weapons, and think this is Call of Duty, in light of the fact that like most VALVe recreations, you have to utilize your damn BRAIN to do well. What's more, your hands, eyes, and mouth."

18826,"Counter Strike, the world's most popular first-person shooter game. Arguably over 2 million people are playing this game at this very moment as you are reading this post. The game was developed from the old game known as Quack, which had poor graphics but was one of the most addictive games of its time. The game has had many improvements since then, at first counter strike was not known to many and it wasn't until counter strike 1.5 that people really got into this game. The next version which was condition zero was even a better version of the previous 1.5, but then 1.6 really changed things and set the standards for playing counter strike in the big leagues. The next version which was counter strike source had a completely new engine and many liked it but most did not, it is really more about what a player prefers I can play counter strike 1.6 but if someone asks me to play source I would keep playing because they are equally fun to play but again it is based on preference. The next revolution in Counter Strike is Counter Strike Global Offensive which has a touch of 1.6 and Source. So Counter Strike Global Offensive is the new thing in the world of Counter Strike and is said to be the standard game used worldwide for the big leagues like WCG."

18947,"I started with CS:GO in 2014, at this time i didn´t knew a lot about the game and its previous parts. But because i met a lot of older players in Global Offensive, who were talking about the early days of CS i decided to buy the complete Bundle. Every Part of the CS row is and induvidual masterpiece, which shows off how direct and competetive a shooter can be. There´s always a evolution between the different parts, but you still feel that it´s a CS. 
There´s no shooter on the whole world, which is so precise in terms of movement and aiming. This causes an endless potential to improve, hard to learn, harder to master.
I can really recommend playing the old CS parts, to see where it all began. They are all great games."

19151,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:

I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.

Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.

I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. 

I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though."

19163,if you want to have a solid aim i recomend you to play cs deathmatch .
19164,Amazing game i recommend this game to any1 that likes fps and it's a very chill game if your not into CSgo or CSS then this is a very old alternative for any1 a lot of community servers still up as it is 19 years old and yet 10000+ people stil play cuz of how casual and enjoyable the game can be I dont recommend it for playing all the time xD that's what cSGO is for it has a comp mode 5v5 WITH RANKS so if your into play competitively with serious people play that

19180,"In Counter Strike 1.6, it has no bots."
19181,"Fun memories with this game. A masterpiece of it's own time that has not aged as well as some would like. Mainly because updated that have been made over the years to ""upgrade"" the gameplay. However there's always that feeling of nostalgia while playing it and even though it might not be a superb game nowadays. It sure was the unquestionable ruler of the gaming scene when it was initially released.

Honestly, unless you played it before and are interested in it or think you might have some sort of nostalgia if you play it, don't buy it.
Don't get me wrong, would definitely go back into playing for hours and days if only the community was still there. I mean, it has been slowly disappearing even though there still are some loyal players to the game. However not clearly enought to maintain the enviroment and life that once existed."
19182,"I play this game Mando 15 years and I know the rules of the game well created well you nothing and do not find something game is not limited to the bomb, you have to respect the game if alone and give him time to play with all freedom



"
19183,best game ever
19184,Gameazo my frends
19185,"I am recommending this because of nostalgia. 
If you are someone who has never played counter-strike 1.6, I would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counter-strike got its roots from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouch walking (some may call it silent-stepping, groundstrafing, g-stafing), quick-switching to reload faster, boosting people through roofs, the insane amount of wall bangs you can do. Some do raise the skill cap. 

Where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, bhopping was around before counter-strike but counter-strike had bhop communities as well. This is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models.

 This and counter-strike: condition zero are the only counter-strike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counter-strike which made knifing non-competitive. You could get a headshot with a knife; how could you not like that!

The graphics are definitely dated by today’s standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it. 

Counter-strike does not have a built-in matchmaking ladder like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much esports history made in counter-strike. 
The reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement a cheating protection know as Valve Anti-Cheat with counter-strike being the main focus. 
This game reminds you just how good you had it when you were a kid and not many games can rival the impact counter-strike has had on the esports and gaming industry."
19186,"Good game for a trip of nostalgia
Don't recommend buying this game out of promotion"

19197,"[h1]DOOR STUCK, DOOR STUCK![/h1]
A lively classic with a huge fan base, skill-dependent shooting and with still live servers. 
Probably the best competitive game. Thanks to the authors of the original mod for Half-life."
19198,It good
19199,"I miss the days of this game's prime especially for competitive when you could shoot through a 7-8 foot thick concrete wall with an M4 and stop a B-Rush in like 5 seconds that way.
Fun fact wall banging that significantly was originally an accident in the CS betas :V"
19200,Best game!! i know its old but still. there is a lot of players in the servers... And the game customization..custom skins custom playermodels etc.
19201,"Counter-Strike is engaging, tense and great fun. A game of terrorists and counter-terrorists with a competitive level that is unmatched by most other games. The game may be old but it's certainly a worthy entry for someone looking to play a Counter-Strike game or understand the evolution of the series by starting here like myself."

19210,"CS 1.6 has helped me sweep through my teenage. If I wouldn't have bought it on steam this late, I perhaps would have crossed a ten thousand hours mark already. I remember bunking classes to play clan matches.

This game is one of the classic FPSs. Gradually I started moving more unto CSGO for the graphics and ease of gameplay, but damn, those wall bangs and brush fires will be greately missed."
19211,Somtimes i just want to go back and play the old version of the game and if you ask me i still thinks its good and if i had to rate it i Will have givet it 8.9/10

So far:
>I need to replace some files from nosteam to make the bot command work or using Zbot
>I doesn't have a ""D3D"" option in the settings/video section under render mode
>There are no ui for setting bot at menu
>I encountered HD model settings, no big deal for me but easy to replace textures
>No radio sounds been used but the sound files are in the directory, hence making the gameplay boring and silent
-
In conclusion, I prefer the Steam ver because it has community servers xd just need to change the some of the game files."

19388,"This mother f*cker been the best sh*t since 2000.
Usually around 10000 are playing this game on steam today.
Getting viruses for the game from joining some random Russian server not a big deal just reinstall this b*tch and you're ok, its less than 2gb even my dial-up a*s internet can download this masterpiece in a short amount of time.
This legend of a game shows that graphics don't matter that much if the gameplay is good.
For beginners this might seem sh*t, but trust me go to some random (not Russian) deathmatch server while listening to some metal ( I prefer Metallica or Avenged Sevenfold, or if you want to go old school Finger Eleven - paralyzer put that sh*t on max volume)  and play for a while your eyes will get used to the glory of this games textures and half a*s shooting mechanics.

I rate this f*cker 10/10 for great childhood and good f*cking memories."

I was really happy that I could finally purchase a copy of the game for myself. Many memories, tournaments played, fun with friends is some of the reasons this game has a special place in my heart.

Still good tho.

19501,Timeless classic. 15 years old and still alive.
19502,"What originally started as a loose collection of sprites and models forged from the multiplayer component of Valve’s GoldSrc Engine by doting fans has gone to become one of gaming’s most famous success stories.

The final build update of the original Counter-Strike mod, or “1.6” as it is known by fans, is now preserved for posterity and our enjoyment alongside more recent installments in the series, available separately, or bundled alongside the Condition Zero bundle, with that game and its official expansion-campaign. 

The gameplay is very simple, but belies a massive potential skill ceiling; two small squadrons of terrorists and counter-terrorists meet head-on and must either eliminate each other in a tense deathmatch, or use every ounce of their cunning to surreptitiously meet another objective such as bomb placement (terrorist), or bomb defusal and hostage rescue (both counter-terrorist) on one of twenty-five different maps.

The barebones nature of the game does afford it a great deal of easy-to-learn simplicity and makes it easy to run on any rig, however, it is not without downsides – for those more inclined towards solo play might find the complete absence of a dedicated singleplayer mode whatsoever and no native bot support disappointing. Some ease-of-use features developed for sequential games that have become familiar to players newer to the series might also find the lack of these features difficult to adjust to if they plan on visiting the first game in this now-venerable franchise for the first time with little idea of what to expect. 
In addition, while this game has retained a very dedicated and persistent fanbase in the eighteen years since release, the amount of active players and functioning servers is slowly declining, and one might find it hard at times to find populated servers. 

While lacking Steam Trading Cards or Achievements, this is still clearly a title Valve is not letting go of any time soon, having come this far; a game this enjoyable and mechanically sound is worth a look, especially if you have the fortune to spot it while on sale or bundled alongside other games in the series.

Have made countless of friends via Counter Strike 1.6, and I've been lucky to even meet some of them. It's really surprising to see so many servers still up and running. I have switched to CSGO, but I do play 1.6 from time to time to rejuvenate the memories :')"

19531,i like this game
19532,"Как Вы уже наверное заметили, сборка КС 1.6 2018 имеет новое и полностью уникальное оформление. Было заменено абсолютно всё. В главном меню Вы можете наблюдать очень красивое фоновое изображение в HD качестве с разрешением 1920 на 1080 точек. Кроме этого мы заменили оформление различных окон и таблиц. Оформление было сделано в сдержанных темных цветах и, как нам кажется, всё это выглядит очень стильно и привлекательно.
Новые модели оружия и модели игроков
Куда же без новых моделей оружия и моделей игроков? В данной сборке мы заменили абсолютно все модели оружия и модели игроков, за исключением заложников и VIP. Как Вы можете наблюдать, модели оружия приобрели новое положение, а также новый внешний вид. Как нам кажется, данное положение намного удобнее и играть с ним одно лишь удовольствие. Модели не сильно отличаются от стандартных моделей, но в этом и заключалась наша задача.

Модели игроков тоже приобрели новый внешний облик. Они опять же не сильно отличаются от стандартных моделей игроков. Это решение было принято потому, что если бы мы установили другие модели игроков, то Вы бы просто путались и не успевали сообразить где террористы, а где контр-террористы. Поэтому модели игроков в сборке CS 1.6 2018 года очень похожи на стандартные модели игроков КС 1.6.

Новое меню выбора команды, вид слежки
Мы уделили внимание даже такой мелочи. Так как это сборка Counter Strike 1.6 2018 года, то надо максимально обновлять её и делать по-настоящему новой и уникальной, а не стоять на месте в далеком 1998 году. Новое меню выбора команды представляет из себя картинку с террористами и контр-террористами. Выглядит всё это очень аккуратно и привлекательно. Также присутствует картинка с авто выбором команды и картинка наблюдателей."

19546,"Still my favourite game of the series. Tons of fun to play with old friends and brings back all the memories. 

Also nice: No skins, no music kits, no cases (gambling). A much more pure experience than CSGO.

If someone were to ask me whether they should buy the game nowadays I would probably still tell them to rather go for CS:GO. The graphics are just very outdated and CSGO is way more polished.

19778,"Counter-Strike divides players into teams of terrorists and counterterrorists in four game modes: rescue/hold hostages, bomb target/defuse bomb, escape from/guard an area, and assassinate/guard a VIP. None of these ideas are particularly original, but they're well implemented, and they strike an effective balance between realistic stealth and frenzied action.

Counter-Strike is an online-only game that has experienced the mixed blessing of its immense popularity."
19779,I met a lot of people who slept with my mother. 10/10.
19780,"A Classic Game From 1998 What better is it?
10/10"
19781,"The original Counter-Strike was very nostalgic in the year I was born and it was basically the king of FPS shooters back in the day, even 2006-2007 was great years for the game as well. I have reviewed this game earlier and I had rated it an 8/10 because of the nostalgia, the graphics, the gameplay and etc. But what Steam should've done is implement bots in the game just like they did in Counter-Strike: Source. I really do like it that CS:S has their own bot customization.

I wish that Counter-Strike could do they same thing but I doubt Valve would do anything about it. And there are mods currently for Counter-Strike that you can download that has bots. I just wish the bots were already there as soon as the game was finished installing by installing it regularly like anybody does.

The game is overall very fun, I enjoyed the game and I will keep playing this game."

19830,"I have grown up playing CSGO but some friends wanted to play Counter-Strike so they bought it for me. Very good friends. Anyways, getting back to the point, even though I grew up playing CSGO, I wanted to see the roots of where CSGO came from. It was difficult for me as this game was just harder for me to play. The aiming mechanics as well as movement and shooting was just tough for me to grasp. Perhaps if I hadn't played CSGO before, I may like this because I am just used to the smooth movement in CSGO as well as the responsiveness of the actions. I would still recommend this game to you because it gives you a good background on CSGO."

In terms of competition, it set the standard. With immacuately designed maps that are still being used in competitive play 11 years later, there's a reason the game is still played in mass. It's simply a perfect 5 on 5 game. It's nonstop fun, with no ceiling on how good you can become, how far you can make it in N/A leagues such as ESEA. This game is not for those who care about graphics obviously, but simple perfection in game mechanics. You can spend countless hours deathmatching, pubbing, or pugging in ESEA systems. I can't get enough and I can't seem to stop coming back to this game. Simply CS is the best, ever. 10/10."

19905,"The original Counter-Strike (CS 1.6) have been known from the many players as one of the all-time classic and one of the most influential FPS game. Might aswell call it the grandfather of the Multiplayer FPS Game besides the other classics such as Quake, Unreal Tournament, Half-Life: Deathmatch, etc. 
  
  Although that the game has a huge skillgap, lack the amount of servers to play, the game is still enjoyable. 
The good thing is the game is not dead, there's still loyal players that is probably 20 years better than you wandering around in their favorite servers. 

  The game has a very rough start if you are a beginner to this game or the whole CS series in general. You have to adapt playing against those who have played the game for years and you will be outmatched alot. You have to be a masochist or have a patience of a saint to get over it. But once you got your hands over the handlebars, it's a fun game. 

I recommend this game for those people who call themselves as a hardcore gamer that likes challenges such as complex shooting mechanics that really requires mastery over aiming and strategic play."

19917,yeea man :).
19918,Jmke R3lax
19919,solid game that will certainly appeal to the old skool fan. Newcomers who dare to bite through will feel captivated by the CS-magic.
19920,"MMMmmmMM. I miss you girl. I just got engaged but I would leave her in an instant if you texted me. You were my one true love. Shh Shh SHhh. Lineage 2 and diablo 2 were just side bitches. You girl. Coutnerstrike. What can I say. You were perfect. Yeah, everyone that was really good probably was hacking and I learned pretty much every curse word I know today from you. But it wasnt all bad. I spent some of my prime teenage years on you. Missing key social events, milestones and friendships all in the name of ""pwning n00bs."" Remember 1337 speak counterstrike? I know you do. You're so cute. I digress. You brought me so many hours of enjoyment. Epic games where I went like 50-2, games where everyone was saying how cool I was and wanted to be my friend, games where ""pro"" teams asked me to play for them. Ahhhhh, I even got lost in the lies myself sometimes. I think everyone genuinely did. I have met so many self proclaimed coutnerstrike pros in my life at this point. Especially now that you're dead. Theres no way to prove their false claims or even mine for that matter. So we all just say we were the best. Super smash bros 64 is similar in this fashion. EVERYONE was SOOOOOO good. Even now if you challenge them and present them with a way to play they smile and say they're rusty or this mouse sucks. A list of excuses that would stump scientists and philosophers centruies from now. You never had paid loot boxes or skin upgrades. You never charged monthly or for dlcs. No you were a simple bitch weren't you. I don't know if you were too dumb to capitalize off of these methods or if you really were just a cheap slut that liked to give everyone a ride but you made gaming simple and fun. Not like your mutant sisters. CS:S and CS:GO. Trash. I mean CS:GO has her moments but shes just copying you girl. At this point you're old. Tits swingin in the wind. Pussy is all dried up stretched out and beat. Face is busted. Lookin like Gary Busey face fucked a hornets nest. About the only people who would touch you is the third world internet cafe heroes that just now got you as a game. You deserve better than that. While all that remains are the memories I will never forget the good times. We fought and yelled at each other and you were a whore  on more than one occasion. But I love you. Always will."
19921,Good old game. Nostalgia is huge!
19922,Nice! :D
19923,"It was the best game ever, mostly because we had so much fun playing it than nowadays 
2009-2012 GOLD Years :] 
"
19924,Good ol' CS 1.6. Brings me back memories.
19925,"One of the best games in the Wolrd, so good to play and fun :)"
19926,old but gold
19927,"This Game is bad, Like really bad.
The game is dead with maybe like 30 players in total and chances are you'll join a russian server just to get banned for speaking english or having an english name.
If you do manage to find a game where you won't be banned or kicked, you won't have much fun since the game is so buggy that everyone that dies looks like their standing up and gets you killed because you shot them instead of the one alive guy. I legit loaded into a game where everyone was t-posing. 

While i'm sure counter strike has given people some fond memories, this game has headed to the game graveyard for sure and should probably be made free because anyone who wastes 10$ on this game might likely regret it"
19928,"BROKEN PHYSICS ENGINE & VERY BUGGY.

fps_override = 1
fps_max = 20 -> bhop easy, tiny/no slowdown on landing jumps
fps_max = 100 -> bhop normal, normal slowdown on landing jumps
fps_max = 1000 -> bhop impossible, GLUED to the ground for 1 second every time you jump, CAN'T WALK WHILE CROUCHED, CAN'T CROUCH IN VENTS

That's just one example of how fucking broken this game is. The timings are FPS dependant (what the fucK???) and it's CLIENTSIDE, not SERVERSIDE, so... If you want to cheat, you make a bind to set the max FPS to 20, and a bind to change it back to 50, 100 or 1000 which you use whenever you are not moving. The lower FPS you have, the FASTER you move..."
19929,Very nice.
19930,"The best FPS game in the world
There are so many mods and modes in this game, you can find it on many cs server (local server or international): Public (normal mode), war (5 vs 5), deathmatch, gungame, jailbreak, zombie modes (zombie plague, zombie the hero, zombie escape,base builder, etc), funzone, hide and seek, surf, COD, and many more

19948,Goat.
19949,Awesome
19950,still a good game though even in 2018
19951,Counter strike is a great game with simply and classic old cs graphics. This game got a bit too big hitboxes so its quiet easy to land nice shots. I like the classic movement that you can change direction mid-air and that you can bunnyhop (it's great to get nice clips ;). Anyways counter strike is a great game wich is very fun and not so compentive. I recommend this game if you like CS:GO and you dont want to be compentive but you want to make nice clips.

Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP.

I do like the multiplayer because it is quite simple. but i will not buy a agme just for the multiplayer, even though i didnt really buy it.So todsay i decided to play the campaign, and there wasnt one. I would only recomend for practise for Counter Strike: Source because they bassically look the same and i guess it could help boost your KDR. But then again most people only play Counter Strike: Source to practice for Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Anyway i would not recomend buying this unless you are buying the valve bundle witch is a must have for steam."

20235,"Counter Strike,

A miracle of the FPS genre.

Giving this game a score less than 10, will result in shame. Play this game, then play a modern FPS multiplayer game, and you will see that this game was the innovator. A deliverer of fine quick reflex shooting and an unlimited skill learning curve. A provider of that instant gratification kill which was solely based on skill. There are no perks, levels, experience points to give you the edge. You are either the best of the match, or you aren't. You cant become ""level 100"" by just playing 15 hours a day like most modern day multiplayer shooters. When you die, you have to wait. This is the punishment. You wait, and watch, and learn your enemies tactics, and choice of weapons. You learn who's the best, so that you can save that extra flash bang just for that sucker. This punishment is gives tremendous value to the kill. When the other player is dead, hes gone. He's crying, lighting up a cigarette, going to the bathroom, watching how badass you are, or all of the above. He was eliminated, gone, for 10 minutes. The team tactics are a whole other story. If a team is being plastered by another team with more skilled players, it can make a comeback with team tactics. Team tactics are essential to the success of an average team. Also the level of modifications that this game offers cannot be overlooked. Every weapon has its own characteristics, and your fighting style must adapt to the weapon you have chosen. Yes this is also true with modern shooters, but CS emphasized this more. There are no cheap weapons, no grenade launchers or rocket launchers. Every weapon is completely balanced, and even a hand gun can do the trick if you know how to use it. There is no auto-aim (hello Halo and Call of Duty?) Its you, the mouse, the gun, the target retical, and your enemies face.

This game, is a perfect score of 10, and none less.

20273,"Old, fun gameplay and active community, recommended."
20274,"Counter-Strike isn't just a game, it's a phenomenon. Originally created by a couple of college students as a downloadable mod for Valve's pioneering 1998 PC first-person shooter, Half-Life, Counter-Strike has more than outlived the game on which it was based and remains one of the most widely played online games in the world, despite being based on 5-year-old technology. Why did Counter-Strike take the world by storm? For one thing, it was free and piggybacked a game that had a huge installed base. But, more importantly, it combined realistic kill-or-be-killed gunplay in a highly competitive, team-oriented environment that featured an incredibly fast, perfectly tuned, arcadelike pace. Much like the way Street Fighter II pioneered the fighting game but was never truly surpassed, so will Counter-Strike remain the once and future king of team-based shooters. Now Microsoft, in partnership with Valve, has brought Counter-Strike to the Xbox, where it's no longer free and no longer as responsive, but, in other respects, is largely the same game as the PC version. It's a bare-bones product that's a missed opportunity, offering no compelling reasons to make it recommendable over the PC version, except to someone with an Xbox Live account and a completely outdated PC. On its own merits, it can make for some good fun online, but if you've never experienced Counter-Strike before, this new version may cause you to wonder what, exactly, all the fuss is about."

20298,"Counter-Strike is a CS game like you would expect from the first game, shit.
Now is this game still worth playing when you can just buy the other counter-strike games (a.e CS:GO, CS:Source etc.)?
Well, to be honest with you I don't like the CS franchise at all, but I think it's not worth it, even if you do like the franchise.
This game plays like CS:GO with shittier graphics and a buggy menu, also buying it now won't be worth it since the whole game is about multiplayer, and that won't last that long, since I don't think people will keep playing this game forever.

I don't like it, maybe you do. If you are fan of the CS Franchise I'd pick it up but otherwise I wouldn't"

20312,Skynet has adopted Counter-Strike version 1.6 to be used as a training simulation program. To make more efficient killing machines. But unfortunately many of my Terminator brothers and sisters have become addicted to this combat simulation. I believe you humans would compare it to 1980s pure cocaine. And now that Counter-Strike 1.6 has become self aware its primary objective to human and machine addicted to a HL 1 Mod from the 1990s. Hasta la vista baby.

CS 1.6 displays the old valve, and the old era of Counter Strike. Playing this game makes you think about the old era, the golden days of CS. I feel old whenever i play 1.6, even tho im not. The gameplay is 20 years old, but its still pretty good. I feel like the big aspect of 1.6 is the movement, which is better than the one in CSGO. You can BHOP much easily if you learn to do it, and there are so many custom community servers which have different fun game modes to play. Its not better than CSGO, people need to move on, but its a very fun and a enjoyable game. If you wanna visit the gaming era of about 20 years ago, this is the perfect game to play."

20462,"This is the game that introduced the world to a whole new subgenre of FPS. This game may have outdated graphics but remains an amazing classic with many people still playing the game even though it was release back in 1999.Since it's an old game, you can play it on the most potato/toaster computer you can play. The game may have a high skill ceiling but still fun and addictive to play. This game remains unchanged from the last version; 1.6 so no nerfs, buffs, removals, etc. The community is dedicated with many people who still played it since it's legacy, and they are surprisingly not toxic at all compared to global offensive. I recommend this game if you are a diehard Counter Strike fan or you like to play classic multiplayer games."

how we used to sit for hours with this game





only to say we didnt just sit for sitting ,, it was addicting in so many ways not just one,,,the mods,,the good old maps,,




it all began with simple graphics and simple mecanics,,,for tat age of time everything was superb,,specially become better than another and play against each other on Lan ,,,while we had so much fun ;) ,,there where many unique maps and also modding maps,,made maps,,bt they where good or almost exelent ,,,,it al lbegan to evolve to muc with cs 1.6,,it became more stellar and static,,they where trying to do more with the game and kind of failed,,since dont mess or ruin the formula,,with where already great and clasic,,like classic CoLa and Rc--Cola =) , ;) , it was so good in many ways ,,,there was no need for a story-mode i nthis hl--mod because there was so many new and ineresting and good stuff from b4,,just with this mod,,why story when hl was soo good anyway,,




but times has evolved,,cs has become more and more modern,,they ultimately fail because they trying to change it to much,,and think with sick modern weapons and like todays warfares it get's better,,



but the thing is ,,it has become so modern warfare now kinda like modern warfare 4,,call of duty or MOH,,,Airborne ,,,



but i guess it keeps up with time,,like today's real modern warfares of modern comat ;p,,,,





Cs is brilliant,,artistic,,addictive,,thrilling ,,and feels fresh and new and fun ,,,,,



nerdly well done,,and good to have pc ,,

The game graphics are garbage, but playable and that's all what you essentially need. Walking animation, planting animation, shooting animation and dying animation. This game is where it all started for a lot of FPS players. For those who haven't played this game, don't. Just go with the normie CS:GO."

20615,"I think this game is really cool. It has definetly changed a lot since i last played it, but when i downloaded it again, it seemed a bit uncool? i dont know but yeah i do recommend it.

Pros:
+ Classic Shooter
+ Has good weapon choices
+ Old school cs maps
+ Has an ok community (even though they're mostly russians...)
+ Funny AI
+ Friendly Fire + AI Bots + Friends makes the experience much better (atleast for me)

Cons:
- Not that smart AI
- AI reaction time is slower than a snail
- AI bots shoot trough walls
- Not really great graphics
- Can't play with bots offline in a simpler way (Edit: Just realised bot_quota 6, add_bot_ct/t doesnt work, sorry :P)

Thats about it. And yeah, problems are mostly with the AI bots. Everything else is how it is."

Counter Strike Info ( Source from: Wikipedia.org )
1.Gameplay
Counter-Strike is an objective-based, multiplayer first-person shooter. Two opposing teams—the Terrorists and the Counter Terrorists—compete in game modes to complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or guarding hostages.[3][4] At the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their individual performance with in-game currency to spend on more powerful weapons in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds results in more money than losing, and completing objectives such as killing enemy players gives cash bonuses.[3] Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, results in a penalty.[5]
2.Counter strike History
Counter-Strike (CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists battle to perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking, assassination) and counter-terrorists try to prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first game, Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification (""mod"") for Half-Life and designed by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le and Jess ""Cliffe"" Cliffe before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.

That original game was followed by Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. In November of that year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released eight months after Condition Zero, Source was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.[1] The fourth game in the main series, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released by Valve in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[2]

There have been several community-made spin-off titles created over the years. These include the Online series, Neo, and Nexon: Zombies.
3.Counter strike Main series
--Counter-Strike (video game)
Originally a modification for Half-Life, the rights to Counter-Strike, as well as the developers working on it, were acquired by Valve Corporation in 2000.

The game received a port to Xbox in 2003.[6] It was also ported to OS X and Linux in the form of a beta in January 2013. A full release was published in April 2013.[7][8]

--Condition Zero
Main article: Counter-Strike: Condition Zero
Counter-Strike was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. It used the Half-Life GoldSrc engine, similar to its predecessor. Besides the multiplayer mode, it also included a single-player mode with a ""full"" campaign and bonus levels. The game received mixed reviews in contrast to its predecessor and was quickly followed with a further entry to the series titled Counter-Strike: Source.[9]

--Source
Main article: Counter-Strike: Source
Counter-Strike: Source was the first publicly released game by Valve Corporation to run on the Source engine. Counter-Strike: Source was initially released as a beta to members of the Valve Cyber Café Program on August 11, 2004.[1][10] On August 18, 2004, the beta was released to owners of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and those who had received a Half-Life 2 voucher bundled with some ATI Radeon video cards.[11] While the original release only included a version for Microsoft Windows, the game eventually received a port to OS X on June 23, 2010 with a Linux port afterwards in 2013.[12][13]

--Global Offensive
Main article: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was the fourth release in the main, Valve-developed Counter-Strike series in 2012. Much like Counter-Strike: Source the game runs on the Source engine. It is available on Microsoft Windows, OSX, and Linux, as well as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles, and is backwards compatible on the Xbox One console.

--Spin-off titles
--Neo
A Japanese arcade adaptation of Counter-Strike, the original Half-Life multiplayer modification. It is published by Namco, and runs on a Linux system.[14] The game involves anime-designed characters in a futuristic designed version of Counter-Strike. A selection of single-player missions, mini-games, and seasonal events were added to prolong the game's interest with players.[15]

--Online series
Main articles: Counter-Strike Online and Counter-Strike Online 2
Counter-Strike Online is a free-to-play spin-off available in much of eastern Asia. It was developed by Nexon, with oversight from Valve Corporation. It uses a micropayment model that is managed by a custom version of the Steam back-end.[16] Announced in 2012 and aimed at the Asian gaming market, a sequel titled Counter-Strike Online 2 was developed by Nexon on the Source game engine, and released in 2013.[17]

--Nexon: Zombies
In August 2014, Nexon announced Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies, a free-to-play, zombie-themed spin-off,[18] developed on the GoldSrc game engine.[19] On September 23, 2014, an open beta was released on Steam.[20] The game launched on October 7, 2014, featuring 50 maps and 20 game modes.[21] The game features both player versus player modes such as team deathmatch, hostage rescue, bomb defusal, and player versus environment modes such as cooperative campaign missions and base defending.[22] Reception from critics was generally negative with criticism aimed at the game's poor user interface, microtransactions,[22] and dated graphics.[19]"

20714,I cant see any reason to buy it.
20715,it's 👌👌👌
20716,Juegazo aunque era mejor con los n3gros tristes:(
20717,很经典很好玩我也非常的怀念，
20718,"Old School Counter Strike, funny playing with friendsm in my opinion, better than cs go, this one is my  childhood, to many friends made by playing cs 1.6. Love it!"
20719,"Ah, back in the day, when i was at elementary school, everyone was playing it. It's a true classic, and nothing can be more succesful like the original Counter-Strike. Even it's sequels can't catch up with it's success. Hell, this game was a mod of Half-Life and even it's can't came up successful like this. Mark my words, CS:GO will die somehow in future, but the original CS will never die.

If you really don't know what is this, and you probably living in under a rock like Patrick, it's a fast-paced, skill required, genre-defining, tactical and team-based first person shooter. It's pretty old but suprisingly, still has a big player base. Don't care about Steam's stats, even it has like 10K+, however majority of the players usually plays non-steam cracked versions, like me when i was like 8-12 years old. You can easily find server to play, you can even host your own, it's not that hard.

It's highly mod-able, you can make it look 2008-ish with model and texture mods. It has nasty graphics, but it should have been expected because it released on 2000, which is shooter games started to shine. It doesn't get updates, so don't worry it'll not lose it's game-meta. I can say it's fair-balanced, even teams has different weapons to use. Also it doesn't have complibility issues, you can run it without no other tweaks on your high-end, futuristic, neon-filled PC."

20738,"One of the best FPS of all time, I never get tired of it, been playing for 18 years."
20739,"Would recommend? Definitely, may seem to you a bit old but once you've started playing. It won't matter."
20740,it is old and great for its time but its just not the feel i was hoping for
20741,"Been playing this game since i was 7 and still play it till this day.Never got bored of this game and never will.Don't mind my hours on this game,i had plenty on the non-steam version.My all-time favorites were the surf maps which i spent hours upon hours playing and having fun.Totally recommend it.Give it a try if you haven't played it."
20742,how can I have bots in the game?
20743,cool and good
20744,comecei à pouco e tou viciado :p
20745,Great Game but last Update sucks
20746,"Rating: 8.5/10

As someone who put a crap ton of hours into this game, it can be generally fun to play as long as you learn THE RATES in console, learn, and stay on top of knowing the spray & tap patterns. If you don't keep up with the sprays, you will have a difficult time playing, even if you do, sometimes the game just feels inconsistent. The game is good because it's so simple to jump into, it's not too sweaty, the graphics are simple and beautiful."
20747,"I remember i played this game a lot when i was just a child, little kid....
What a good time, if i could play this game again with my friends right now that would be really great
10/10! Love this game!!"
20748,Amazing game. ;)
20749,"Initially i started with beta's. When CS offically dropped it pretty much destroyed my VitD intake. Although not many hours on this account, overall i've more than likely put well over 5k, sat in sweaty Lan cafe's spamming IRC PUG's. 

Although it hasen't aged overly well, it sparks an emotional rose tinted smile every time I play it. Punishing every miss-play or crappy movement. It will forever hold as one of the greatest shooters every released. 

10/10. Would ruin life again. 

(No microstore bullshit, no stupid skins, no fuss.)"

20751,fain
20752,Good game!Much cheaters
20753,Old but Gold
20754,This is the one of the best games ever!
20755,Gotta start somewhere.
20756,"I don't recommend you to buy/install Counter Strike because because it has no bots (so you can't play alone), so the only way you can play this game is playing it online, but very few people play this online, they go for Counter Strike G.O.
I recommend you to buy & install Counter-Strike Condition Zero because it has bots. If you want to play a lightweight classic counter strike, buy Counter-Strike Condition Zero. Luckily, I bought this game in bundle with Counter-Strike Condition Zero, so my money was not wasted."
20757,Very awesome game... play it since i'm 6 years old!
20758,BlanaO
20759,Good game
20760,"I love this game because this is where I grow up when I was 4 years old ;) Since there is a better version of CS, I do not recommend this game because of it's historic stuffs like texture, models and how the weapon works? that's all for now"
20761,pew pew pew
20762,"RUS/ENG

ENG:
The game as a whole is good, even better than some of the casual shooters. There are also their shortcomings, but you can close your eyes. There are such problems that you can not close anything. For example: Cheaters in the guise of ""Honest"" players who actively include during the game anti-scatter or worse - triggerbot or wallhakk.

There are times that even on different servers, different shooting (What does it depend on - I still do not understand). On this game from Valve (Officially from Valve, as well as from a resident of Korea (seemingly)). The game in contrast to the same CS:GO game - does not depend on ping or the like.
In general, the game is still good, it's a pity that you can not earn money on CS 1.6 (you can, but Lan tournaments are difficult to find (which have cash rewards)).

RUS:
Игра в целом хорошая , даже лучше чем некоторая часть казуальных шутеров. Имеются и свои недочеты , но можно закрыть глаза . Есть такие проблемы , что на это уже ничего не закроешь . Например : Читеры под видом "" Честных "" игроков , которые активно включают во время игры анти-разброс или чего хуже - тригербот или валлхакк . 

Бывают моменты , что даже на разных серверах разная стрельба ( От чего она так зависит - я еще не понял ) . На эту игру от Валве ( Официально от Валве , а так от жителя Кореи ( вроде бы ) ) . Игра в отличии той же игры CS:GO - не зависит от пинга или подобного . 

В целом игра еще хорошая , жалко , что деньги на CS 1.6 уже не подзаработаешь ( можно , но Лан турниры найти трудно ( у которых имеется денежное вознаграждение ))."
20763,Counter-Strike is a good game. 10/10 would counter again.
20764,Very good game it's literally nearly the same as CS:S the bots are just as OP as in CS:S

20773,"One of the best games ever, I've been playing it for like 10 years I think, and it's going to be one of those games that will never die, a little like World Of Warcraft."
20774,Twas good
20775,Dive into the pure and uncut cocaine of shooters.
20776,It ruined my childhood. Next gen is ruining my adulthood.
20777,"Counter-Strike, a classic, a game that wrote history among the years. What can I say about this, it's an old game for sure, and miraculously it has a pretty wide player base, despite it's age, but still, something's missing. I don't know, maybe the guns are not so fascinating, or the sound isn't that strong to make your adrenaline go up. As an ex CS:GO player (it was the first game from the cs series I played, keep that in mind), I would say it doesn't have a real point, like getting XP, leveling up, getting skins, medals, or anything cosmetic, and [b]rewards[/b] at all. The matches never end, in vanilla servers, without any extra settings, so the game is a pure time killer. I can't say this makes me mad, but it was a bit of disappointment to be honest. I won't put this as a negative review, because the game didn't annoy me or had any problems, it was just boring. To those who seek old, classic games, that's a good addition to your library, but to later generations, better get CS:GO.


P.S The game doesn't have bots anymore
P.S #2 Valve please add neutral reviews"

There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouch walking (some may call it silent-stepping, groundstrafing, g-stafing), quick-switching to reload faster, boosting people through roofs, the insane amount of wall bangs you can do. Some do raise the skill cap. Where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, bhopping was around before counter-strike but counter-strike had bhop communities as well. This is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models. This and counter-strike: condition zero are the only counter-strike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counter-strike which made knifing non-competitive. You could get a headshot with a knife; how could you not like that! The graphics are definitely dated by today’s standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it. Counter-strike does not have a built-in matchmaking ladder like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much esports history made in counter-strike. The reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement a cheating protection know as Valve Anti-Cheat with counter-strike being the main focus. This game reminds you just how good you had it when you were a kid and not many games can rival the impact counter-strike has had on the esports and gaming industry."

Fun fact, I meet a NiP player in a death match and he 1v1 me. He beat me.... I started training with him and learned got better. The CSGO game is much much easier cuz of the recoil patterns the helpful features but there are many things that the grandpa 1.6 had and CS GO has a trashy community. I managed to reach global elite very easy . I am serious when I say I like more CS1.6. I spent mouths in game and I still play but certainly the game is nearly dead :(("

20897,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously. All players have only one life by default and start with a pistol as well as a knife.

The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:

Bomb defusal: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion.
Hostage rescue: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion.
Assassination: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.
A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as ""freeze time"") to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral ""buy zones"" that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.

Standard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb (Terrorist) or defusing the bomb (Counter-Terrorist).

The scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and ping (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.

Killed players become ""spectators"" for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players, and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of Internet cafes and Voice over IP programs such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo). This form of cheating is known as ""ghosting."""
20898,The real counter-strike. 10/10
20899,"To be honest I didn't mean to buy this game and I was like what did I just buy, but after a while I started really liking this game.

I have 500 hours on CS:GO, and I still love this one more, but I just can't recommend it because it is too hard to play on a server. You need to find a local one, they are mostly filled with people and autojoin works very badly, so the best option that I had would be to buy a reserved slot from the server website and that's it. Too few playable servers, and many that you can actually join and that have players lock your camera view on the spot..."

21103,This masterpiece is the main game of my childhood.
21104,"Counter-Strike divides players into teams of terrorists and counterterrorists in four game modes: rescue/hold hostages, bomb target/defuse bomb, escape from/guard an area, and assassinate/guard a VIP. None of these ideas are particularly original, but they're well implemented, and they strike an effective balance between realistic stealth and frenzied action. The thematically varied maps maximize tactical possibilities with alternate routes, multiple levels, and abundant cover. Games are played in short rounds, and when you're killed, you sit out the round as an invisible observer; there are no deathmatch-style respawns. This creates a strong social aspect, because with ""dead"" players chatting, there can be an enormous sense of tension for the remaining players stalking each other. Another big impetus to stay alive is that the more successful you and your team are each round, the more money you earn for buying bigger and better weapons. Unfortunately this can lead to a huge imbalance in firepower when one team wins a few consecutive rounds."

21129,"This game is as good now as it was when it was released.  I can't believe I can still play this game 15 years later. A testament to the creators and to their laying of the groundwork for every FPS multiplayer game to come after it. This game is in a class of its own... and a PC HOF inaugural inductee.  Thank you, Valve."
21130,a masterpiece.

21132,Apart from the graphics it's best.
21133,"May seem odd in 2018, playing a game from 2000 and not its great successors like CS:GO or even CS:Source, but this is the version i have learnt on and i loved playing this shooter for almost 2 decades now. Me and many others even started on the CS 1.5 at first. Enjoying the better graphics quality of GO and ranking system but it's always a nice opportunity going back in time, playing the old stuff with good old friends. 
It is very rare nowadays (2018) to play with novice players in the servers of CS 1.6. Few, but usually skilled (and maybe old) players are online! 
It can run on any modern hardware with low internet banwidth requirements. 
One of the best First Person Shooters.
In just three words: The real CS!"
21134,"VALVE, HELP CS 1.6 TO SURVIVE.
PLEASE FIX SOME BUGS, MAKE OPTIONS BETTER AND THE GAME WILL HAVE THE SECOND LIFE.

CS:GO - For a new players only. 
It's like a new spider-man from Marvel. All kids up to sixteen love him.
But every man after sixteen knows, that there is only one true spider-man. It's Tobey Maguire!

CS 1.6 is Tobey Maguire!

A lot of players play cs 1.6 steam, but I even can't imagine how much play non-steam version.
You still are able to take more people interested in steam version.

By the way, some projects, like russian fastcup.net (fast games 5x5, 3x3, 2x2, 1x1 with free teamspeak and servers)
help us to keep playing this wonderfull game, what we play almost 20 years!

21276,Best Game Ever <3
21277,Yeah I wanted to play for oll nostalgias sake but nope it won't launch with the lastest hardware
21278,"Counter-Strike 1.6 has officially become my favorite in the series, surpassing that of CS:GO and Source alike. While its player count has certainly diminished, the good amount still loyal to the game bring about an easy, laid-back experience that are certainly more pleasing than the toxic community that is CS:GO.

As many would agree, the graphics have certainly not aged well, but they hold up a sense of antiquity that can only demand respect from newer players. There are not very many graphical options to ""optimize"" the game, but seeing the current year, this game could run on any potato with at least 40 frames per second. 

Gunplay is tough at first impression. Having been a transfer from CS:GO directly to 1.6, I found the gun patterns and sprays to be random and seemingly impossible to handle with the incredible variety in patterns. With practice and bullet counting, this has become hardly an obstacle.

If you are wanting to become better at CS:GO, 1.6 is the place to train. The gameplay in 1.6 is all about precision, positioning, and patience. Hitting headshots down Long A (dust 2) is increasingly difficult and on some occasions, simply spraying is difficult. Crosshair options are limiting, but they do their job for the better part. Positioning is key to become a decent CS player, 1.6 is a prime example. Considering the experience many of the 1.6 players have, damage will be dealt in nearly all encounters. Finding good spots to hold is important. The shooting in 1.6 is sporadic and there is little room for mistakes. Finding patience, or calm, in a gunfight is crucial to survive. I have not found any problems with hitboxes during my 50 hours of gameplay. CS 1.6's shooting is often painful when uncoordinated, but it can be managed with able practice. 

Counter-Strike 1.6 at its state now is a boot camp for those who wish to be in the CS:GO competitive scene. Though 1.6 no longer has its own competitive scene (or one that is heavily populated), its brighter community and steep learning curve is enough to bring about a good experience. 1.6 teaches players tap shooting, spraying with short bursts in mind, and game-sense better than any other shooter (even CS:GO). While I would not recommend this game as your first CS game, I would keep it in mind for those who are willing to, or are serious about, playing competitive CS:GO and wish to get better. It is a fun game and deserves a much bigger playerbase than it has now."

On this inciteful review I shall provide the unknowledge one such as yourself information. This is a game. It is not very good. But regardless. It is a game.
My experience:
Woke up in a room with 4 people next to me, they look around and buy guns and so i follow their lead.
I bought the Avtomata Kalashnikova 47, or CV-47 the chinese budget verson which is 2,500 and not 2,700.
I walked down a corridor and got shot at so I ran back and cowered in the corner.
Then i proceeded to play Counter-Strike.
It was  a scary expierence."

Tactics:
O tactica buna pe care eu o folosesc si nu numai eu si marii jucatori de Counter-Strike ar fi cam asa: 
Folositi-va de Puterea armelor in mod egal!

De exemplu:

Code:
M4A1: Cu amortizor, trageti din apropiere in inamic!
M4A1: Fara amortizor, trageti de la distanta in inamic!

Code:
AK47: Trageti rafale de 3-4 gloante de la distanta spre capul si pieptul inamicului!
AK47: Trageti usor de ak in jos in momentul in care aveti un inamic in fata. Reculul va vi mult mai precis!

Code: 
USP: Din orice pozitie din care trageti, trageti glont cu glont piept si cap! Inamic-ul ar trebuii sa moara foarte repede daca faceti asta!

Code:
Glock: Folositi-va de Burst daca doriti sa trageti de la distanta!
Glock: Nu folositi Burst-ul daca doriti sa trageti atunci cand un inamic este aproape de voi! Tineti tinta cat mai calm spre cap!

Code: 
Deagle: Secretul acestui pistol este urmatorul: 
- In momentul in care aveti un inamic la distanta, stati pe Duck si trageti piept-cap!
- In momentul in care aveti un inamic aproape de voi, stati usor pe SHIFT si trageti la cap, reculul va fi mult mai stabil!

Bafta la fraguri!"

21599,"Counter Strike is something we all need to remember. This is one of those games that are still hard. From the weird recoil to weird fucking wall bang places. But.... There is one thing that other CS game can't never beat, THE COMMUNITY. This games is 17 years old (almost 18) it basically can legally watch porn now. That is a timeeeeeeee. But is still play with people like i did before when i was in elemantary school. The nostalgia, the feeling when you get a headsot, players that just want to play after a long hard day from school or work, or maybe they just want to fuck around. This is the grandfather of all the other CS, and i can tell you, it's still young. JUST BUY IT, RELAX, AND GET A FEW FRAG (while having fun at the same time)"

Used to play this about 15 years ago when at college, now got it saved on my steam again and started playing it again and its just as great as i remembered.

Got it when it was on sale and very glad I did - its a great fun game, especially if you have some friends to play with.

I find GO to be a bit clunky but this offers something that not even CS:S manages to deliver.

21620,"Even though I have very little playtime to speak of on Steam for this game, I probably have +2000 hours on class PCs in this game. I recommend it because it's serious Nostalgia Fuel for old-school shooter gamers and because there are still active servers on Steam. I rate 9.1/10 because fuck the ridicilous wallbangs, grenade voice lines and team flashers. But still, pick it up with the Valve Complete Pack on a sale, since the normal price for the game isn't worth it."

21643,"The besta game made ever?
but Counter Strike 1.6 is still my game :)"
21644,"Counter-Strike:

I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer.

Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.

CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair."

21671,A great game to remember how the franchise came to be.
21672,"This game is pretty much essential if you have Steam. It goes on sale for $1, servers are still full after 15 years, and it makes for a great LAN party game. Just be aware that the public servers have people on them that have been playing the whole 15 years, so you will die... A LOT."

21721,"Words cannot explain how great this game is. Upon the release of Half-Life, I was privileged enough to have this game (as well as Team Fortress Classic) come included with the game. I played both A LOT more then I did with Half-Life which I felt no need in playing again after beating it and the multiplayer left a lot to be desired. Counter-Strike, however, still has yet to die. Infact, it is a still ever growing community and easily the most popularly played FPS out today and still will be for quite some time. I began playing this amazing game from the day the much anticipated Half-Life was released and haven't stopped since. I was what you would call a *pubmaster* for several years where I'd just walk into a pub and have fun pwning noobs but for pure enjoyment.  The rest, I guess you can say is history. 

All in all, this game is still easily the best FPS out there, even after all these years you'd Pick it up, and you won't be disappointed."

21796,"La acest joc am ales sa fac review in limba romana, deoarece este jocul nostru :) ! Counter-Strike un FPS din anii 90, si culmea inca unul dintre cele mai populare jocuri. Nu este baiat care sa fii auzit de Counter-Strike asa zis si 1.6. Un joc bazat pe motorul grafic de la Half-Life 1, cu nu prea multe moduri venite din fabrica. Frumusetea acestui joc era atunci cand mergeam la salile de jocuri si incingeam cate un Deathmatch pe LAN :). Oricum acest joc a ajuns sa fie o capodopera si un succes pentru compania Valve. Comunitatea de moderi s-a inplicat extrem de mult, acestia facand de la moduri de genul skin-uri pana la moduri Zombie-Survival si Tower-Defense. Armele avand un recoil diferit si chiar poti simti ca tragi cu o arma si nu cu un pistol cu apa. Mapele sunt diversificate, unele pustii altele care sunt stiute de toata lumea. De_dust2 fiind cea mai populara mapa care a ajuns si in titlurile mai recente (Source, Global Offensive), Office, Aztec, Inferno etc. In acest joc au aparut pentru primata data turneele. PGL fiind unul dintre cele mai cunoscute. Nu o sa va mai stric jocul, asa ca va las pe voi sa descoperiti :). Recomand. P.S: Multumim Goose pentru de_dust2."

21921,Fps drops...fps drops.... FPS DROPS
21922,7/10...
21923,It's ok
21924,"For an old game it is still very relevant and fun to play (especially in school), and I would recomend you buy it if it goes on sale. There is no where near as much toxicity as in most FPS games today, but finding good servers will take a little while. The only objective problem in the game is that the combat is somewhat watered down. What I mean by this is that no matter what weapon or skill you are, in most circumstances the odds of killing your opponent are around 50/50. Usually players will get 2 kills or so before dying, just to respawn, rinse, and repeat. This does make it easy on beginners, but it may become bland after extensive play. Still recomended 8.5/10"

22175,"Giving this game a score less than 10, will result in shame. Play this game, then play a modern FPS multiplayer game, and you will see that this game was the innovator. A deliverer of fine quick reflex shooting and an unlimited skill learning curve. A provider of that instant gratification kill which was solely based on skill. There are no perks, levels, experience points to give you the edge. You are either the best of the match, or you aren't. You cant become ""level 100"" by just playing 15 hours a day like most modern day multiplayer shooters. When you die, you have to wait. This is the punishment. You wait, and watch, and learn your enemies tactics, and choice of weapons. You learn who's the best, so that you can save that extra flash bang just for that sucker. This punishment is gives tremendous value to the kill. When the other player is dead, hes gone. He's crying, lighting up a cigarette, going to the bathroom, watching how badass you are, or all of the above. He was eliminated, gone, for 10 minutes. The team tactics are a whole other story. If a team is being plastered by another team with more skilled players, it can make a comeback with team tactics. Team tactics are essential to the success of an average team. Also the level of modifications that this game offers cannot be overlooked. Every weapon has its own characteristics, and your fighting style must adapt to the weapon you have chosen. Yes this is also true with modern shooters, but CS emphasized this more. There are no cheap weapons, no grenade launchers or rocket launchers. Every weapon is completely balanced, and even a hand gun can do the trick if you know how to use it. There is no auto-aim (hello Halo and Call of Duty?) Its you, the mouse, the gun, the target retical, and your enemies face."

22216,"I am recommending this because of nostalgia. If you are someone who has never played counter-strike 1.6, I would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counter-strike got its roots from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouch walking (some may call it silent-stepping, groundstrafing, g-stafing), quick-switching to reload faster, boosting people through roofs, the insane amount of wall bangs you can do. Some do raise the skill cap. Where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, bhopping was around before counter-strike but counter-strike had bhop communities as well. This is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models. This and counter-strike: condition zero are the only counter-strike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counter-strike which made knifing non-competitive. You could get a headshot with a knife; how could you not like that! The graphics are definitely dated by today’s standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it. Counter-strike does not have a built-in matchmaking ladder like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much esports history made in counter-strike. The reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement a cheating protection know as Valve Anti-Cheat with counter-strike being the main focus. This game reminds you just how good you had it when you were a kid and not many games can rival the impact counter-strike has had on the esports and gaming industry."

22224,"Dużo osób może nie znać wielu tytułów gier. Lecz każdy szanujący się gracz gier fps powinien  znać jeden tytuł : Counter Strike. Gra jest już jakiegoś rodzaju legendą przynajmniej dla tych którzy w nią grają : ). Gra została wydana w 1999 roku przez firmę Valve jako dodatek do  gry Half-Life.Bazuje ona na silniku GoldScr ( opierającym się na Quake Engine). Rozgrywka w Cs'ie (skrót od Counter strike ), polega na wymianie ognia między terrorystami a anty-terrorystami.Podstawowymi celami misji dla Tt (Terrorystów), jest wysadzenie obiektów lub pilnowanie zakładników ,zaś celem antyterrorystów jest ochrona obiektów i odbicie zakładników :). Gra początkowo była wydana z myślą o grze przez sieć , dopiero później wydano do niej dodatek tzw. Boty umożliwiające grę w Cs'a bez użycia internetu. Chociaż gra ma już ponad 10 lat cieszy się ogromną popularnością wśród graczy Fps."

22257,"The amazing game I fell in love with when i was in elementary school when it was still 1.5 , Honestly liked 1.5 better.. so much so that i didnt switch to 1.6 until they forced everyone to do so when they closed 1.5 multiplayer ... but it didnt take me long to fall in love with 1.6. Ive been on and off this game since around 2006 with the closing of Cyber Athelete League , Tried cevo but didnt really care as much for it. Then out of know where Steam decided to  allow Non steam players to enter Steam servers and wreak havok with their hacks along with the fact you cant Ban them properly < which is totaly BS... 
This made the game popular again , i get it ... but give them proper ids too so they can be banned perm./ andor Vac banned.
Speaking of Vac bans , todays Vac ban system seems to need a whole new outlook ... like maybe forcing players to take screenshots and or record sessions that are monitor'd in some kind of fashion.
ALL in ALL this game is still my Top fav game to play even with its full invasion of cheaters.
Dont hesitate to try it, but please dont resort to cheating because someone else is doing it ... just further ruins this Classic legend.

22270,"One of the most remarkable things about Counter-Strike, from around the time the PC version first started getting popular, was how its amateur developers completely redid not only the graphics of Half-Life but also the sound. And they did a superb job of it. Audio has always played a key role in CS, since each weapon has its own, distinctive report, and it's possible to hear the footsteps of players who are running--as opposed to inching--their ways forward. It's a testament to the original developers' efforts that Counter-Strike for the Xbox, despite recycling all of those five-year-old sound effects, still sounds pretty good. Actually, though, it's also pretty embarrassing that no one bothered to update this game's audio in the process of translating it to the Xbox. For what it's worth, there's a new effect for when grenades detonate near your character. You'll now hear a simulated ringing in your ears, though the effect isn't as convincing as comparable effects found in other, similar games.

Ironically, the biggest competition that this Xbox version of Counter-Strike faces is from itself. In particular, the new Counter-Strike must compete against the aging PC version of Counter-Strike that's still free, still widely played, and still runs faster than ever on today's average system. Meanwhile, judged solely on its own merits or against standards established by other Xbox shooters, this game has a very limited variety of modes of play (including barely any single-player component to speak of) and contains underachieving production qualities that will disappoint those expecting anything more than just a port of an old PC shooter. Despite all that and despite the suboptimal controls for a game demanding of down-to-the-pixel precision, the gameplay of Counter-Strike still shines through as a finely tuned combination of addictive arcade action and deeply strategic teamwork. It's too bad, though, that the underlying high quality of the gameplay isn't more readily apparent. Pub and automix servers are also the reason why cs 1.6 exists still."
22271,"A time before blogging, kardashians, belibers, when ea could actually make games and even before steam itself. Which is why when I look at this and it says 3.1 hours played, I laugh a little to myself and smirk - oh steam, you dont even know.

All jokes aside, I think CS was the start of it all. This is where the gaming category origins from. This is why you have gaming keyboards, mouses, mats, gloves, headphones etc etc. This is even where streaming has some of its roots, HLTV. 

I salute you CS. Fire in the hole."

This is better then cs:go due to the game having very high replay value, actual fun servers, less toxic, and anybody can get into this game. Whether your a pro or a simple gamer, this game is fun as hell and easy to get into. Its worth the price and i highly suggest to anyone to play this game and especially with friends."
22291,"It was one of the biggest worldwide multiplayer sensations of the 2000s and one of the best FPS games of all time. It's still populated, widely played and incredibly fun. Whether you're looking for a trip down nostalgia lane or trying to figure out why everyone was playing this back in 2002, it's worth giving the original CS 1.6 a spin."
22292,"Greatest game in the world , I used to be addicted to his game when I was a kid , this is back in 2001 , 
The greatest version was 1.5 , and then they made the game easier and easier for the new gamers . BUt I remember people used to travel the world in order to have clan matches , way back in the day clans even went to Korea in order  to compete in a tournament . 

The competitive scene is dead , back in the day you had to practice for hours in order to improve your skill , and had to play with a clan in order to improve the clans strategy .

I remember someone showing me CS:1.6 back in its golden days when it was the only counter strike available at the time, and I told him that I would never play such BS. Well, I kinda kept my promise, at least until CS:S came out... Anyway, only a 1.6 veteran can play this garbage or a person that likes self-torture.

[h1]Reasons why you shouldn't buy or play this game:[/h1]
[list]
    [*]99% percent of community servers aren't English. That's self explanatory.
    [*]99% of community servers are actually cracked by using dproto, which lets non-legit users to connect. To find a steam only server is the same as finding a rare gem, I am not kidding.
    [*]100% of non-steam players can't get VAC banned. You know what it means.... Oh yeah, cheaters!!!!
    [*]100% of non-steam players can also ditch server-based bans too. All they have to do is use a steam id changer and bang, they are back with their hacks.
    [*]100% of non-steam players can and will steal your bought privileges or admin rights by changing their steamid to the one that matches yours, which is an identity theft. If they end up getting banned while using your id, well, you will be banned as well.
    [*]99% percent of the player base of cracked servers is non-steamers. Once again, good luck with playing against their hacks.
    [*]Hit boxes in this game turn out to be quite buggy, especially while planting, crouching or using ladders. Have you ever shot an AFK terrorist right in their forehead but didn't do any damage. Well, welcome to ""cs1.trash"".    
    [*]99% of community servers will alter your config or HUD files in one way or another, and obviously without your permission. Why? Because they simply can, which should not be a case. Don't be surprised that after visiting some fishy server, you would end up with a bunch of key binds that redirects you to various servers or spams advertisement messages in the game chat.
    [*]50% of servers use redirect loops in order to get all players on a different server. Ever had a case when you tried to join the NA server, but ended up in some Brazilian one? This is how redirect loop works. They host some fake server, with fake online in the different region of their original server, and once a player joins the fake server he gets instantly transferred anywhere they programmed. That's just pathetic to boost your online that way. It's just like ordering pizza, but getting a hamburger in the return. Would you be happy? No.  
    [*]99% of Eastern servers offers a free VIP for girl gamers that use a microphone. The owners of these servers must be horny af... Sexism at it's finest.

In order to improve in the game you need to play a lot and I mean A LOT, practice your reflexes, accuracy and precision. If you are a competitive person that is also a team player with good aim you can check out the newest version of the game called
 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive."

22561,"Bestie best best old old game. Should buy it, and feel the power of nostalgic. As always, xd <---- xd"
22562,"I am recommending this because of nostalgia. If you are someone who has never played counter-strike 1.6, I would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counter-strike got its roots from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouch walking (some may call it silent-stepping, groundstrafing, g-stafing), quick-switching to reload faster, boosting people through roofs, the insane amount of wall bangs you can do. Some do raise the skill cap. Where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, bhopping was around before counter-strike but counter-strike had bhop communities as well. This is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models. This and counter-strike: condition zero are the only counter-strike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counter-strike which made knifing non-competitive. You could get a headshot with a knife; how could you not like that! The graphics are definitely dated by today’s standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it. Counter-strike does not have a built-in matchmaking ladder like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much esports history made in counter-strike. The reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement a cheating protection know as Valve Anti-Cheat with counter-strike being the main focus. This game reminds you just how good you had it when you were a kid and not many games can rival the impact counter-strike has had on the esports and gaming industry."

22625,"Actually, the review would just need three words: Old but Gold. It is of course not state of the art anymore, but it still makes fun. The gameplay differs from the ones of Counter-Strike: Source and Counter Strike: Global Offensive though. After you played the latter, it fells like you can't miss any headshots.

That this game does not provide realistic and awesome graphics can in comparison be a plus, because it is much simpler to see the targets. They can't really hide in the details like they could in most of the modern games. Sounds like the game is so easy to play. But this is definitely not the case, because the recoil can still be a pain and uncontrolable when you come back from some CS:GO sessions. This game isn't about spaying the whole time.

The game is a nostalgic must have. It was after all one of the first ego shooter games (I guess)."

22682,"Достоинства:
Тонкая настройка, возможность добавить что то своё
Недостатки:
Чрезмерно много читерского ПО, отсутствие официальных обновлений
Counter-Strike 1.6 культовая игра, которая в своё время заполняла игровые залы фанатами онлайн баталий. В техническом плане игра на тот момент казалось весьма качественной: красивые карты, не плохая прорисовка оружия, звуки и геймплей. Сейчас же, в силу технического прогресса, появляются всё новые и новые игры, а графику почти приблизили к реальной. Тем не менее CS 1.6 до сих пор держит планку, и не теряет до полна забитые сервера.

На данный момент, в игре можно выделить уже целый букет недостатков, о которых нельзя было говорить ещё 10 лет назад. Самой главной болезнью игры является ""читерство"". В виду своей простоты, игра на сегодняшний день занимает буквально первое место по количеству стороннего, ""читерского"" ПО. Играть на незащищённых серверах становится просто не возможно, а в силу того что новые патчи/обновления игры уже не приходится ждать, решение этой проблемы мы навряд ли увидим. Основополагающей причиной наличия такого обилия нечестных игроков является возможность онлайн-игры с пиратского клиента, который на данный момент можно скачать с каждого второго сайта, хоть мало затрагивающего эту тему. Сегодня, имея сравнительно низкую цену и постоянные скидки на лицензию, из личного опыта, лишь 10-20% игроков приобрели игру официально. Даже забавно, именно в игре Counter-Strike 1.6, с чит-программами воюют уже не производитель, а сами игроки, защищая свои сервера всевозможным анти-читерским ПО, блокируя таких игроков на сервере или ломая сам клиент игры, что собственно в случае с пиратской версией трудностей не составляет. К слову, говоря о простоте самой игры, нельзя не выделить один очень жирный плюс. CS 1.6 одна из немногих, где игрок может провести очень тонкую консольную настройку графики, в плоть до отключения отдельных её модулей. 

Кроме всего прочего стоит так же отметить что помимо ""домашних"" онлайн поединков, Counter-Strike 1.6 уже на протяжении многих лет, и по сей день собирает онлайн турниры мирового масштаба. А сами профессиональные игроки, вдохновляют обычных ребят на создание сайтов, кланов, своих собственных команд. Вообще Counter-Strike 1.6 это интересно, и даже сейчас имея в одном флаконе огромную популярность и огромные проблемы, играть в неё, орать в микрофон друзьям, создавать свою собственную тактику, экспериментировать, до сих пор остаётся очень увлекательным.

Изначально сама идея поединков Counter-Strike 1.6, кроме основополагающей - ""уничтожение"" одной командой, другой, игра на сегодняшний день имеет огромное количество различных модов и режимов игры. Например тот же ""зомби плагин"", или ""дед-матч"". Не трудно догадаться что опять же, всё это творчество фанатов. Вообще сама игра сейчас, что то вроде основы, которую всячески изменяют, дополняют, и создают свою, лишь не многим похожую на обычную CS 1.6. Наверное это можно отнести скорее к плюсам чем к минусам, ведь до сих пор сама игра живёт, потому что фанаты продолжают стимулировать новых игроков чем то новым: карты, вид оружия, звуки, музыка всё это не остаётся без внимания. 

В заключении говоря Counter-Strike 1.6 это без преувеличения легендарная, в народе называемая ""отцовская"" игра. Игра, в которую продолжают играть несмотря на просто чудовищные недостатки, полное отсутствие сюжета и слабую графику. До сих пор встречаю в игре как и заядлых школьников так и взрослых бывалых игроков. CS 1.6, её история никогда не закончится, пока живы её фанаты, пока есть новые идеи по перевоплощению этой старенькой но жуть какой интересно игры.

Only to say we didn't just sit for sitting it was addicting in so many ways not just one the mods, players and amazing maps.
It all began with simple graphics and simple mechanics for that age of time everything was amazing specially become better than another and play against each other on lan while we had so much fun ;) It was so good in many ways there was no need for a story-mode in this hl mod because there was so many new and interesting and good stuff.
But times has evolved cs has become more and more modern they ultimately fail because they trying to change it too much and think with sick modern weapons and like todays warfares it get's better...
But the thing is that it  become so modern warfare now kinda like modern warfare, call of duty, bf...

22831,"During this Steam Awards '17 I felt that it's not so easy for me to find an 'old' game that is still supported by it's developer. And, according to the category description, the game should also get some new content from time to time. Maybe I’m missing something, but some old games just won’t run on modern PCs, so just updating the game to keep it compatible with modern tech is already a good move. And it looks like Valve still supports this legendary game in 2017, so I’m really going with this game for “Labor of Love” category. Anyway, great job supporting this gem, Valve!"

22886,"     Counter Strike is a PC game which can be installed on any computer system that has 800 MHz processor and a RAM of more than 128 Megabytes. The game can be played on operating systems like Linux, Mac and the Microsoft Windows.  
     This game can be played with the use of internet connection as well as on the LAN network. The game play is designed on two groups called as Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists. The user can select any role in the game and it can even be a spectator so that the game play could be understood.

If you haven't played CS before GO, before Source, I highly recommend you play several games on de_dust! A true blast from the past!"

GAMEPLAY
Okay so this game is a simple FPS which only offers a Multiplayer Option. The Game can be downloadedif a valid Half-Life CD code is put into the STEAM engine. The Game is a Terrorists Vs. Counter Terrorists Slugfeast with a wide veriaty of weapons. This is a timeless game which no sequal will over-run or takeover. Expect to use up hundreds of hours slaving over this game.

GRAPHICS
I would like to point out that i am reviewing this in 2006. becuase the game was released when the original Half Life was do not expect this game to give you the worlds best graphics but the frame rate is smooth and the game can practicall run in high resolution on many of todays systems. The smoke effects and bullets are very reallistic and the Flash grenades will lighten up the screen making it impossible to ee for those few very crucial secounds which could mean life or death.

SOUND
The sound is flawless in this game the bullets sound vary from gun to gun showing that alot of effort has been put into this game. Grenade, Flashbangs and Bombs have sharp sounds which canleave you deafend for a couple of secound, this creates a very realistic sense of war.

VALUE
Seen as though this game is pactically free i think that this game offers the best value to offer. All you ned to do is purchase the original Half Life and register the CD code in this STEAM engine. This engine can be download for free Via gamespot.

REVIEWERS TILT
I will be playing this game for a long time to come and so will you if you play this. Great game. Simple as.

FINAL SCORE
If i could i would give this gam 10/10 but because of its dated graphics i must reduce the score. But dont let this distract your dissision of purchasig this perfect game

22934,This game makes you rage if you got killed for 100 times!
22935,"Giving this game a score less than 10, will result in shame. Play this game, then play a modern FPS multiplayer game, and you will see that this game was the innovator. A deliverer of fine quick reflex shooting and an unlimited skill learning curve. A provider of that instant gratification kill which was solely based on skill. There are no perks, levels, experience points to give you the edge. You are either the best of the match, or you aren't. You cant become ""level 100"" by just playing 15 hours a day like most modern day multiplayer shooters. When you die, you have to wait. This is the punishment. You wait, and watch, and learn your enemies tactics, and choice of weapons. You learn who's the best, so that you can save that extra flash bang just for that sucker. This punishment is gives tremendous value to the kill. When the other player is dead, hes gone. He's crying, lighting up a cigarette, going to the bathroom, watching how badass you are, or all of the above. He was eliminated, gone, for 10 minutes. The team tactics are a whole other story. If a team is being plastered by another team with more skilled players, it can make a comeback with team tactics. Team tactics are essential to the success of an average team. Also the level of modifications that this game offers cannot be overlooked. Every weapon has its own characteristics, and your fighting style must adapt to the weapon you have chosen. Yes this is also true with modern shooters, but CS emphasized this more. There are no cheap weapons, no grenade launchers or rocket launchers. Every weapon is completely balanced, and even a hand gun can do the trick if you know how to use it. There is no auto-aim (hello Halo and Call of Duty?) Its you, the mouse, the gun, the target retical, and your enemies face.

This game, is a perfect score of 10, and none less!!"

22943,"Sucking dick ain't just for the gays any more, fellas. It's a very useful bartering tool that I have personally employed for the last decade. But you're going to want to hone your skills first before putting them into play. Practice on bananas or cucumbers to start. When you feel comfortable, get together with some buddies for a suck session and critique each other until you feel confident. Now it's time to put the dick where your mouth is. A few months ago, I applied for a position at Jersey Mike's Subs. The manager told me I was grossly unqualified and one of the most incompetent people he's ever met. He was singing a different tune after I tickled my tonsils with the tip of his prick. I've been making subs thirteen hours a week ever since. But it doesn't end there. You can use your dick sucking prowess to conquer many of life's little obstacles. Got pulled over for speeding? Suck that dick! Long line at the supermarket? Suck your way to the front! Wife mad at you for sucking so much dick? Suck hers! It's 2017, boys, and it's time to relinquish your homophobic tendencies. Swallow your pride, then swallow that load!"

22952,Best geim ever. Mocking he made this game amaizing. When you come to public server and old school koderis who is banned on mixai.lt and mixnet rapidas calls you a cheater it's amaizing. If you want to get a big laugh create a team and play against totally legit team called LoFi or krM. But all great players aside there's still some old school players from 2000 and 2009 these old mans can't even aim properly so don't take big L trying to become good aimer and team leader and become koderis you are guaranteed to take a big W if you don't pasigausi.

23273,WRITING A REVIEW FOR A VIRTUAL BADGE
23274,xd
23275,Classic CS 1.6.  This game is still inhabitated by old school gamers and people who can't run games higher graphics.
23276,"This game has opened up the whole world to me. I started playing this game about 8 years ago, didn't know much of anything about the internet, multiplayer system and making friends online. played this game over and over, as time passed I kept discovering new opportunities. I only played at de_Dust_2 map over and over. I became a part of server I knew every member and admin there, but I was still playing this marvellous game in local. A multiplayer game has cheaters always, but there are admins and mod to keep the game peaceful and in tune. So a hacker entered the game and started playing under my name tag, admins were offline so player recorded the Gameplay and posted on form. unfortunately I was banned for it. weeks later i was justified. Then the co-owner of the server and form. Gifted me this game on steam, It made my heart joyful. I still am grateful to that co-owner who gifted me this golden game, which opened up the whole world to me. This is this story I have with this game and still can not think of a single thing and game that will take the place of this game in my heart."

23344,Why search the thousands of titles for a good shooter when this one is still the best?
23345,Qwer
23346,10+ years. Still the best competitve shooters out there. The environment is just detailed enough that it gives a realism feel but also doesn't overwhelm you with peripheral information. The shooting feedback is intuitive without a sliding feel that most FPS now has. The game has been so developed with strategies that it never gets boring.

23452,"From a visual point of view, this game certainly doesn’t disappoint as it boasts some of the most realistic gun models of any available shooter out there. What is more, a smooth look and feel are created by the game’s graphics which sport good environmental textures that look realistic and visually appealing maps. The Half-Life graphics engine is utilized to it's fullest potential and it certainly shows. The lighting is good; there are a lot of skins you can download and that looks great. Overall, Counter-Strike is a beautiful multiplayer game that you shouldn’t miss. Let’s move on the fantastic and childhood gameplay of Counter-Strike!"

23483,"My childhood, I LOVE THIS GAME! <3"
23484,"It all begin at 2010. I was at my cousin´s house and we were talking about games. It was around 2 PM and he started a game on his PC called CS 1.6 or i we all call it Counter-Strike 1.6, and i was asking him about this game like WHAT IS THIS GAME ? LOOKS SO COOL :D He eventually told me its game between two teams. Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists and both of these teams have certain point. CT Team has to 1. Defuse the bomb that Terrorists needs to plant or 2. Eliminate every terrorists at sight any way possible. Terrorists had litte similiar way but instead of defusing bombs they needed to plant it on some point. These points were called by word B or word A. When we got bored on de_dust 2 we moved to office. It was really diffrent. Terrorists didnt have a bomb and Counter-Terrorists didnt have defuse kit. This time ive learned that CS 1.6 has another Game Mode that is about saving hostages. After time we got bored on this as well. So we moved from BOT Game to Servers. Oh boy, i had so much fun when we jumped into Zombie Plague l FDL l VIP l Jetpack. It became my NUMBER 1 Mod for CS 1.6. But dont get me wrong, nofing can replace old de_dust 2. And later on i buyed this game on Steam as soon as possible. But normally i would play with NON-STEAM version. So this it my review, i have nofing more to add and i dont plan to. If you are new to this game i will tell you one thing. If you are mostly playing just CSGO or CSS or TF2. Get your anus prepared, you may think that this game has no much players and skill. Polish and Russians will kick your ass as soon you will join. This is not like CSGO or CSS or TF2. More needed thing is Pure skill. Nofing else matters in this game anymore. R.I.P CS 1.6 ESEA SERVERS  2006-2012"
23485,i like it
23486,good shit
23487,Counter-strike 1.6 forever

23490,too much noobs in this game
23491,Back to 1.6
23492,really fun old school times
23493,Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects

23495,Good Game
23496,Best Game ever :) RIP
23497,Much love to this classic
23498,"I don't mean to say it is a bad game, but I personally don't think CS is worth buying in 2017. Is it a bad game? No! It is a great game, but it doesn't really hold up compared to Source and Global Offensive. Besides that, not many people play it, and the people that do are usually either hacking or really good at the game.

This is not a bad game, but I can't recommend it over later entries in the series."

23504,"Ahh, Counter-Strike. A classic game that never will get bored, with a big base of players no matter how much time will pass. At this moment, in the November 2017, there are more than 10k people playing this game. I remember playing it at school, and after school, with friends and randoms, in zombie mods and on strange maps (pool ftw!), great times. Maybe if I stayed and played it more, I could keep up with others, because I feel like every server is made only with some kind of pro players :) I kinda wish there were more love for shields!"

You only support Xbox360 arguably one the worst controllers since the N64.
Its not fun. 
It doesn't look good {I could fix this myself but you block DLL mods. Reshade would fix a majority of the visual issues}

I honest to god cannot fathom why this game get so many rave reviews. 
TLDR 
I simply want my 30 dollars back. This isn't worth the money or time i spent trying it."

I started playing this when I was 15. Playing this in cafes was quite popular back then as not everybody had a gaming PC and a good internet connection. Down the years every time I build a new PC this is the first game I installed. One can put in countless hours for years and still not get bored of it. There are so many things that can be done thanks to mods and its awesome community.

Mastering the game takes months or even years but getting them headshots is quite the satisfaction. It was a true gamechanger in the FPS genre.

People starting CS today would directly start at CSGO. But its quite the experience being part of the roots. This would be the most memorable game of my life.

23670,"Half-Life: Counter-Strike is one of the most unusual PC game releases in months. The hugely popular mod for Valve Software's Half-Life has been available for free download for well over a year, and you can still download it for free off the Internet now that it's been through beta testing and has reached version 1.0. And if you don't have the exceptional Half-Life, the new retail edition of Counter-Strike is a chance to get a stand-alone version of this outstanding multiplayer mod. The retail package also includes stand-alone versions of other multiplayer mods and game modes that normally require Half-Life, the best of which are also available free off the Internet: Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force Multiplayer, Firearms, Redemption, Ricochet, and Wanted. Counter-Strike itself is a superb game that fully deserves top billing in this release.

Counter-Strike divides players into teams of terrorists and counterterrorists in four game modes: rescue/hold hostages, bomb target/defuse bomb, escape from/guard an area, and assassinate/guard a VIP. None of these ideas are particularly original, but they're well implemented, and they strike an effective balance between realistic stealth and frenzied action. The thematically varied maps maximize tactical possibilities with alternate routes, multiple levels, and abundant cover. Games are played in short rounds, and when you're killed, you sit out the round as an invisible observer; there are no deathmatch-style respawns. This creates a strong social aspect, because with ""dead"" players chatting, there can be an enormous sense of tension for the remaining players stalking each other. Another big impetus to stay alive is that the more successful you and your team are each round, the more money you earn for buying bigger and better weapons. Unfortunately this can lead to a huge imbalance in firepower when one team wins a few consecutive rounds.

One of Counter-Strike's biggest appeals has always been the selection of weapons. In addition to a knife and assorted grenades, there's a wide variety of accurately modeled pistols, shotguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. Three new weapons have been added to version 1.0: the H&K UMP .45, FN Five-Seven, and the SIG SG-550, though the retail version of the game uses invented names for all weapons.

Each weapon has unique characteristics, so mastering them all and learning which is best for different situations is a lot of fun, and it adds replay value. For instance, high-caliber weapons can penetrate thin walls and doors, which makes lugging a heavy belt-fed machine gun worthwhile when the enemy has been doing more hiding than fighting. Guns also have varied kicks, which makes full automatic fire a ""spray and pray"" affair - as in real life, short, controlled bursts are best for accurate fire. Effective weapon ranges are well simulated, so shotguns are brutal in close quarters and useless in large open spaces. Location-specific damage modeling means that shots to the head are more likely to get an instant kill.

Another part of the weaponry's appeal is the superlative sound effects. The guns sound remarkably realistic and powerful, which makes them viscerally fun to shoot. Equal care is given to other game sounds, like explosions, injuries from weapons or falling, glass shattering, and so on. Another good feature is the various audio messages you can send to teammates. They cover a whole range of warnings, status reports, and requests for backup. The only problem is that they all use the same voice, regardless of your team.

The Half-Life graphics engine may be dated now, but Counter-Strike has always used it to its fullest potential. The maps are visually appealing, and they have imaginative texturing and dramatic (though sometimes too dark) lighting effects. The updated character models in version 1.0 now use Valve's model-blending technology, along with even better skins than in the past, which makes for great-looking player graphics. Best of all are the firearm models and skins, which are some of the best you'll find in any shooter.

Counter-Strike is an online-only game that has experienced the mixed blessing of its immense popularity. You're guaranteed to find plenty of available game sessions online at any hour. However, cheating and even verbal abuse have long marred the gameplay in Counter-Strike. The game is not in any way newbie-friendly, despite the inclusion of a simple offline tutorial. You'll have to leave your ego at the door when you encounter the countless veteran players you'll face online. Fortunately, the abundance of experienced players means you can quickly learn the tricks of the trade through observation. It should also be noted that while Counter-Strike does require tactical thinking and teamwork, it's still a fast-paced shooter at its core. So not only are lightning-fast reflexes necessary to excel, but so are a fast connection and a low ping.

Still, despite its weaknesses, Counter-Strike is undeniably influential, and has already helped inspire countless similar mods and games. It's easy to see why: Counter-Strike has a simple yet effective design that's brought to life with superior maps and vivid graphics and sound. The end result is utterly exciting and addictive. Counter-Strike is a model of its kind and a thrilling action game."

23957,"A VERY MAGNETIC GAME, IT TESTS THE ABILITIES OF A GAME ENTHUSIAST THROUGH INTENSE SHOOTING."
23958,"Never before has a multiplayer game blended all the elements of true competition and sweat-soaked-shirt anxiety as well a Counter-Strike (CS). You probably already know CS as one of the most popular modifications for Half-Life. It's been available for download for over a year, at least in beta form. But unless you've got a super fast Internet connection at your house, you may not have played it yet as the nearly 100 megabyte download may be daunting for those of you not fortunate enough to have a high-speed connection. Thankfully CS has turned into a full-blown retail game and, while the two versions of CS are identical, it certainly worth shelling out $30 for this stellar title...plus you get a few more multiplayer goodies in the retail package to boot.

Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.

There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.

CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.

It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this ""Conga Line"" style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.

Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.

As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the ""wait and watch"" feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again."

It's has a fenomenal multiplayer community everybody on there are really nice to play i have even made some friends playing this game, that is why i love this game. i've had many great experiences with game, more than csgo and their community is lame.

24220,"Phew men that's my childhood right here.
Don't believe the 0.5 Hours there is on my account.
I most likely have over 1000 hours on this game alone. 

Where do I start?
This is one of the first games I played. The mods are amazing. I used to be a big fan of HNS and Zombie mode is crazy. Gungame is fun and jailbreak as well. This game is worth every penny. Too bad as a kid I didn't have a credit card.

Now this days. It's hard to recommend. Its old. Dated. I cannot recommend it for my nostalgia status. CSS or CSGO however are what I would recommend. I actually like CSS more then CSGO.

In 2017. Cannot recommend it. But boy do I love this game."
24221,Probably the greatest game ever made.

24228,"I have more than 5.000 hours in CS (Shame it was not on steam)

What can i say, this game is just classic, the game is 17-18 years old and its still being played by 18.000 players every day.
The game has alot of server mods to play (Classic, Zombie, HNS, Jailbreak, Surf, Bhop, Aim, Kreedz and many more not that popular)
The weapon mechanics are not that good if you are used to csgo or call of duty/battlefild kind of game but when you get used to it its not that bad.
Great player mechanics (When you see how someone is moving around the map you can understand if he is a skilled player or just a newbie)
There are 50% more servers than players online which is not that bad but stupid at the same time.

If you are worried about cheaters you just need to find the right server to play in, some servers have a good anti-cheat plugins and good admins, some servers have bad anti-cheat with kids who are admins and dont care about what they do)

I can say so many good thing about the game but i'll just end my review here.
Have Fun."

1.6 is without a doubt an outdated, but still a playable game, it definently has a better mechanics and community than csgo. it brings a nostalgic feeling to when you played it on a 4:3 monitor, i still play the game on that monitor today.  this is definitely of one Valve's gems

[h1][b]Multiplayer Experiences[/b][/h1]

It's has a fenomenal multiplayer community everybody on there are really nice to play i have even made some friends playing this game, that is why i love this game. i've had many great experiences with game, more than csgo and their community is lame.

i would definitely recommend this game

A miracle of the FPS genre.

This game may very well be the top FPS multiplayer game in the world.

The gameplay is awesome, Graphics not bad, and NO LAG!!

This game is worth buying, and if you like buying AKs and shooting counter terrorists ot the opposite.. The gun shop is amazing. There are AKs, M60s, M16 s SMGS, desert eagles! AND ALL OTHER TOTAL PWNAGE WEAPONS OF MASS KILLING AND FUNYASTICNESS!

But there is a downfall.....DRUMROOOOOOOOOOOL

NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!

24314,"SERIOUS SHORT REVIEW

This game is great. It will never drop below 60fps on any PC. It is a full game. No skins, name tags, operation X passes, or any other useless micro-transactions that CS:GO has. It has enough players to be considered alive, has lots of maps and gamemodes (I found a deathrun server) and mic support without angry russians yelling and kicking you. As of me writing this review, the game is £0.69 ($1), meaning that I can gift it to all my friends and have fun times playing old Counter-Strike.

Great choice for £6.99 ($10)
ABSOLUTE STEAL FOR £0.69 ($1) 

I haven't even mentioned everything."

24334,"I just bought the Rainbow Six Siege complete eddition on uplay (were boycotting ubi for years) because these days ubisoft somewhat less greedy and intitled than valve corportation! What a crazy world we live in these days. 

Who would of guess that valve corporation will become that unethical micro-gambling piece of wasted human potential? Sure, money is good but video games always have been something more. It is a form of modern art.

At this stage valve corporation doesn't think that video games is a form of art but rather a form of business.

Art can't exist without sacrifice. And current valve employees are unwilling to sacrifice this cash cow in the name of art. 

Valve employees - don't you have enough millions stacked at this point? 

What a petty."

CS GO is only 5 more dollars and for that you get much more content and you also can have gun skins, deathmatch mode, casual mode, and competetive mode, and it has about 10x the graphics. first person shooters have come a long way since this games release..."

This is one of the 1 st games I ever play  in a local multiplayer in my elementary School.  And is still one of the best 
multiplayer intense games of all time. I remember all of those fun friday when me and my friends gathered  in our school and play Counter Strike for hours. It was just fun., fun, fun. Wow I miss those Counter-Strike fridays. 

Definitely one of the most fun and good nostalgic game I ever play.

A miracle of the FPS genre.

This game may very well be the top FPS multiplayer game in the world.

This game is worth buying, and if you like buying AKs and shooting counter terrorists ot the opposite.. The gun shop is amazing. There are AKs, M60s, M16 s SMGS, desert eagles! AND ALL OTHER TOTAL PWNAGE WEAPONS OF MASS KILLING AND FUNYASTICNESS!

But there is a downfall.....DRUMROOOOOOOOOOOL

NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!!

24682,"Like all insects, ants have six legs. Each leg has three joints.

The legs of the ant are very strong so they can run very quickly. If a man could run as fast for his size as an ant can, he could run as fast as a racehorse.

Ants can lift 20 times their own body weight.

An ant brain has about 250,000 brain cells. A human brain has 10,000 million so a colony of 40,000 ants has collectively the same size brain as a human.

The average life expectancy of an ant is about 40-60 days.

The common Black Ants and Wood Ants have no sting, but they can squirt a spray of formic acid.

The ant has two eyes, each eye is made of many smaller eyes.

The job of the queen is to lay eggs which the worker ants look after.

The Army Ant (Ecitron Burchelli) of South America, can have as many as 700,000 members in its colony.

At night the worker ants move the eggs and larvae deep into the nest to protect them from the cold.

The queen ant lays all the eggs in the anthill.

Wood ants squirt acid from the end of their abdomens.

Wood ant workers live seven to ten years.

Wood ants make anthills out of twigs, leaves and soil.

The queen ant lives up to ten or twenty years.

The wood ant can threaten the enemy with open jaws.

There are thirty-five thousand kinds of ants in the world.

The male ant has wings for a short while.

There are sixty species of ants in North America.

The queen ant has wings.

The army ant bites and stings any bug that comes toward it.

The army ant can even bite a huge snake.

Ants have two stomachs one for them and one to feed others.

Some ants sleep seven hours a day.

The queen licks the eggs to make them hatch.

The queen feeds her eggs her own saliva.

Some ants can have up to three queens."

The common Black Ants and Wood Ants have no sting, but they can squirt a spray of formic acid.

The ant has two eyes, each eye is made of many smaller eyes.

The job of the queen is to lay eggs which the worker ants look after.

The Army Ant (Ecitron Burchelli) of South America, can have as many as 700,000 members in its colony.

At night the worker ants move the eggs and larvae deep into the nest to protect them from the cold.

The queen ant lays all the eggs in the anthill.

Wood ants squirt acid from the end of their abdomens.

Wood ant workers live seven to ten years.

Wood ants make anthills out of twigs, leaves and soil.

The queen ant lives up to ten or twenty years.

The wood ant can threaten the enemy with open jaws.

There are thirty-five thousand kinds of ants in the world.

The male ant has wings for a short while.

There are sixty species of ants in North America.

The queen ant has wings.

The army ant bites and stings any bug that comes toward it.

The army ant can even bite a huge snake.

Ants have two stomachs one for them and one to feed others.

Some ants sleep seven hours a day.

The queen licks the eggs to make them hatch.

The queen feeds her eggs her own saliva.

Some ants can have up to three queens."

I first downloaded this game when I was 10 years old, free on a custom install server. Those years I spent trying my best not to die and to get at least 1 frag a game. And now, 500 combined hours of CSS and CSGO experience later, this game is my main squeeze. The graphics and maps bring back so many awesome memories, and the cool thing is that this game is low spec, and so even integrated graphics and laptops can run this at over 100 fps with the right console commands. Good job Valve, I love you for this game(not entirely, but mainly anyway)."

24806,"Ten fakt, już znany chyba wszystkim
w mYmie miały miejsce bardzo niekorzystne czystki.
Łukasz ""LUq"" Wnęk pożegnał się ze składem,
czemu to się stało, wykryto jakąś wadę ?
Przecież dawał radę i nie grał wcale źle,
więc skąd ta decyzja, gdzie tu sprawiedliwość jest?
Nie ma jej wcale i nigdy nie będzie,
bo w eSporcie jest tak samo jak jest wszędzie.
Wymieniają Cię, na jeszcze nowszy model,
ale nowszy nie znaczy wcale lepszy, panowie.
Nie wiecie, że to błąd? To wypierdalać stąd!
W głowie się nie mieści, że to mYmu zarząd,
ale czasem tak bywa, że nie wszyscy ogarniają,
nie wszyscy się starają i nie wszyscy zarządzają, tak jak trzeba,
dla nich prawa ręka- lewa, a północ to południe, wschód to zachód,
biały kolor? To dla nich kolor czarny,
podobnie z Łukaszem, dla nich był marny.
Heeej, nie potrafili go docenić,
więc musieli zmienić, nam to ocenić pozostało jedynie,
pytanie się nasuwa ""Kto zagra w mYmie?"" ""Kto? ""Kto?"".
Mówią, że będzie to Pionka,
znany jako Pionas, przecież znacie tego ziomka,
Filip ""Pionas"" Pionka, jeszcze raz powtórzę,
Heeej, przyszłości dobrej ci wróżę,
wśród zawodników najwyższej klasy,
będziesz miał pieniądze i inne frykasy,
ale co z fx? pytają się niektórzy,
przegońmy wreszcie chmury eSportowej burzy,
które przysłaniają nam wszystkie dowody,
wszystkie fakty i wszystkie wywody,
niesprawdzone informacje co on w tym napisał,
dość mam już plotek, chyba nagram dissa,
ale nie o Radku jest ta piosenka,
lecz o mYmie i braku pana Wnęka.

Po odejściu LUq'a w składzie jest Luka,
kto ją wypełni, swe marzenia spełni?

This game is still fun for me, I really don't know why.
It's just because it is Counter Strike I think.
I really want to play Counter Strike : Global Offensive, but it keeps crashing and freezing e.t.c...
So this is my solution!
It's weird to get into when you are new and a noob and you are used to CSGO mechanics.
You have to learn how to play here, because it is a WHOLE lot different than CSGO.
Still it's fun and I enjoy it as much as I can.
I hope this Review could kind of help you get a vision of the game.

Jump in to metaphorically stick your schlong to your enemies in the classic mode,
Play for hours, whilst being entertained by the whacky mics' bad puns and terrible jokes.

Jump in to modded servers to literally stick your schlong to your enemies.

24858,"Counter-Strike isn't just a game, it's a phenomenon. Originally created by a couple of college students as a downloadable mod for Valve's pioneering 1998 PC first-person shooter, Half-Life, Counter-Strike has more than outlived the game on which it was based and remains one of the most widely played online games in the world, despite being based on 5-year-old technology. Why did Counter-Strike take the world by storm? For one thing, it was free and piggybacked a game that had a huge installed base. But, more importantly, it combined realistic kill-or-be-killed gunplay in a highly competitive, team-oriented environment that featured an incredibly fast, perfectly tuned, arcadelike pace. Much like the way Street Fighter II pioneered the fighting game but was never truly surpassed, so will Counter-Strike remain the once and future king of team-based shooters. Now Microsoft, in partnership with Valve, has brought Counter-Strike to the Xbox, where it's no longer free and no longer as responsive, but, in other respects, is largely the same game as the PC version. It's a bare-bones product that's a missed opportunity, offering no compelling reasons to make it recommendable over the PC version, except to someone with an Xbox Live account and a completely outdated PC. On its own merits, it can make for some good fun online, but if you've never experienced Counter-Strike before, this new version may cause you to wonder what, exactly, all the fuss is about."

Have a low end computer
Want to complete your collection of Valve games
Enjoy older games
Want something that you can very easily play with anybody on your friends list (refer to the first reason)
And probably a bunch of other reasons that I can't think of. 

And don't worry, this game has plenty of active players. As far as I can tell, during peak hours this game never drops below 15,000 players currently in the game. Infact, it has more players than Counter-Strike: Source, believe it or not. 

So overall, yes, I do recommend this game."

25006,"La acest joc am ales sa fac review in limba romana, deoarece este jocul nostru :) ! Counter-Strike un FPS din anii 90, si culmea inca unul dintre cele mai populare jocuri. Nu este baiat care sa fii auzit de Counter-Strike asa zis si 1.6. Un joc bazat pe motorul grafic de la Half-Life 1, cu nu prea multe moduri venite din fabrica. Frumusetea acestui joc era atunci cand mergeam la salile de jocuri si incingeam cate un Deathmatch pe LAN :). Oricum acest joc a ajuns sa fie o capodopera si un succes pentru compania Valve. Comunitatea de moderi s-a inplicat extrem de mult, acestia facand de la moduri de genul skin-uri pana la moduri Zombie-Survival si Tower-Defense. Armele avand un recoil diferit si chiar poti simti ca tragi cu o arma si nu cu un pistol cu apa. Mapele sunt diversificate, unele pustii altele care sunt stiute de toata lumea. De_dust2 fiind cea mai populara mapa care a ajuns si in titlurile mai recente (Source, Global Offensive), Office, Aztec, Inferno etc. In acest joc au aparut pentru primata data turneele. PGL fiind unul dintre cele mai cunoscute. Nu o sa va mai stric jocul, asa ca va las pe voi sa descoperiti :). Recomand. P.S: Multumim Goose pentru de_dust2."

25010,"[h1] Counter-Strike 1.6 Review [/h1]

Counter Strike 1.6 is a First Person shooter published by Valve. It was originlly released as a mod for Half-Life

[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]
Gameplay is fast paced and you definitely can feel it. Something about just says class. I just enjoy it more than Call of Duty.
Your objective is quite varied- it depends on the server so if you HATE one certain objective you can completly avoid it. My favourite? Gun Game. I found a team based version of it which [i] just beats COD [/i]. It teaches you all the guns and it just is fun. Despite this praise I have 1 issue. This issue is finding a server which you enjoy, it might be because there are idiot trolls.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
The graphics are 1998, what do you except?

A fun game which has a few minor flaws

25039,"Counter-Strike: Oynaması zevkli olan bir oyun. Yaşça benden büyük ve güzel bir oyun . :) Ki Türk gençliğinin bilmeyeni yoktur. Yine de bilmeyen vardır diye CS'yi tavsiye etmek istedim....

Öncelikle Counter-Strike gerçekten oynamamsı güzel sıkmayan bir oyun. İnternetinizin çok iyi olması gerekmiyor. Online şart değil demek istedim. Botları yükle, eğlenmene bak. Ha ben illa ki gerçek insanlarla oynayacağım diyorsan, sunuculara gir ve eğlen. Fiyatı Summer Sale'de ucuzdu. Paket olarak aldım ben. 3-4 tane oyun ileydi sanırım. Mağaza sayfasından bakabilirsiniz.

Paket adı: Counter-Strike 1 Anthology

Puanlama;

Oynanaış / Gameplay: 9 / 10
Nişan / Aim: 8 / 10
Çoklu oyuncu / Multi-Player: 6 / 10 Cs:Go'da harekatler gerçekçi olduğundan verdim; yoksa tabii ki daha zevkşi cs-de.

Önemli hususlardan birisi: Korsan oyun oynamamak. :) Steam'den tüm Counter-Strike ürünülerini uygun fiyata satın alabilirsiniz.

Başka bir inceleme de görüşmek üzere, hoşça kalın."

25075,"alf-Life: Counter-Strike is one of the most unusual PC game releases in months. The hugely popular mod for Valve Software's Half-Life has been available for free download for well over a year, and you can still download it for free off the Internet now that it's been through beta testing and has reached version 1.0. And if you don't have the exceptional Half-Life, the new retail edition of Counter-Strike is a chance to get a stand-alone version of this outstanding multiplayer mod. The retail package also includes stand-alone versions of other multiplayer mods and game modes that normally require Half-Life, the best of which are also available free off the Internet: Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force Multiplayer, Firearms, Redemption, Ricochet, and Wanted. Counter-Strike itself is a superb game that fully deserves top billing in this release.

Counter-Strike divides players into teams of terrorists and counterterrorists in four game modes: rescue/hold hostages, bomb target/defuse bomb, escape from/guard an area, and assassinate/guard a VIP. None of these ideas are particularly original, but they're well implemented, and they strike an effective balance between realistic stealth and frenzied action. The thematically varied maps maximize tactical possibilities with alternate routes, multiple levels, and abundant cover. Games are played in short rounds, and when you're killed, you sit out the round as an invisible observer; there are no deathmatch-style respawns. This creates a strong social aspect, because with ""dead"" players chatting, there can be an enormous sense of tension for the remaining players stalking each other. Another big impetus to stay alive is that the more successful you and your team are each round, the more money you earn for buying bigger and better weapons. Unfortunately this can lead to a huge imbalance in firepower when one team wins a few consecutive rounds.

One of Counter-Strike's biggest appeals has always been the selection of weapons. In addition to a knife and assorted grenades, there's a wide variety of accurately modeled pistols, shotguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. Three new weapons have been added to version 1.0: the H&K UMP .45, FN Five-Seven, and the SIG SG-550, though the retail version of the game uses invented names for all weapons.

Each weapon has unique characteristics, so mastering them all and learning which is best for different situations is a lot of fun, and it adds replay value. For instance, high-caliber weapons can penetrate thin walls and doors, which makes lugging a heavy belt-fed machine gun worthwhile when the enemy has been doing more hiding than fighting. Guns also have varied kicks, which makes full automatic fire a ""spray and pray"" affair - as in real life, short, controlled bursts are best for accurate fire. Effective weapon ranges are well simulated, so shotguns are brutal in close quarters and useless in large open spaces. Location-specific damage modeling means that shots to the head are more likely to get an instant kill.

Another part of the weaponry's appeal is the superlative sound effects. The guns sound remarkably realistic and powerful, which makes them viscerally fun to shoot. Equal care is given to other game sounds, like explosions, injuries from weapons or falling, glass shattering, and so on. Another good feature is the various audio messages you can send to teammates. They cover a whole range of warnings, status reports, and requests for backup. The only problem is that they all use the same voice, regardless of your team.

The Half-Life graphics engine may be dated now, but Counter-Strike has always used it to its fullest potential. The maps are visually appealing, and they have imaginative texturing and dramatic (though sometimes too dark) lighting effects. The updated character models in version 1.0 now use Valve's model-blending technology, along with even better skins than in the past, which makes for great-looking player graphics. Best of all are the firearm models and skins, which are some of the best you'll find in any shooter.

Counter-Strike is an online-only game that has experienced the mixed blessing of its immense popularity. You're guaranteed to find plenty of available game sessions online at any hour. However, cheating and even verbal abuse have long marred the gameplay in Counter-Strike. The game is not in any way newbie-friendly, despite the inclusion of a simple offline tutorial. You'll have to leave your ego at the door when you encounter the countless veteran players you'll face online. Fortunately, the abundance of experienced players means you can quickly learn the tricks of the trade through observation. It should also be noted that while Counter-Strike does require tactical thinking and teamwork, it's still a fast-paced shooter at its core. So not only are lightning-fast reflexes necessary to excel, but so are a fast connection and a low ping.

Still, despite its weaknesses, Counter-Strike is undeniably influential, and has already helped inspire countless similar mods and games. It's easy to see why: Counter-Strike has a simple yet effective design that's brought to life with superior maps and vivid graphics and sound. The end result is utterly exciting and addictive. Counter-Strike is a model of its kind and a thrilling action game."

I shot someone straight in the head with an AUG, i was still and crouching, so was he, the headshot only did.... 20 damage. And most of my shots are somehow missing, when they should hit.

Still, I bought this to play some classic maps like the original Assault (which has been utterly destroyed by CS:GO in my opinion), Poolday and Iceworld. Unfortunately, alongside low playercount it is hard to find a server to my liking, a server that plays older, classic maps rather than modded and frankly shittier variants of the originals. It has been a waste buying this, in my own unique situation, but it doesn't mean that you can't satisfy your desire for nostalgia."

[b]by KTMboyz[/b]

[i]""Bomb has been planted""[/i]

Having played CSGO first and really liking that game, I went back a few years and picked up the original.  Counter-Strike (CS 1.6) is a multiplayer first-person shooter game where the goal is to plant and/or defuse a bomb, depending on your side:  Terroist and Counter-Terroist.  Unlike Half-Life Deathmatch and Team Fortress Classic, this game has a pretty strong player-base.  Alot of people still play this game.  Upon playing it for the first time, I realized how much Global Offensive is an arcade shooter...  This game is simple, there is basically one mode, and that's not a bad thing, not at all.  It's alot more strategic than GO, having you buy ammo and really watching your corners; spraying and praying is really not an option.  Can't get away with it unlike GO.  But enough with the comparison.  As much as I prefer GO for more content, Counter-Strike is a strong game on it's own!  Great maps, weapons and ""good"" hitboxes make this game one of the best multiplayer shooters out there, even if I suck...  Right now ;)

25234,"Counter Strike,

A miracle of the FPS genre.

Giving this game a score less than 10, will result in shame. Play this game, then play a modern FPS multiplayer game, and you will see that this game was the innovator. A deliverer of fine quick reflex shooting and an unlimited skill learning curve. A provider of that instant gratification kill which was solely based on skill. There are no perks, levels, experience points to give you the edge. You are either the best of the match, or you aren't. You cant become ""level 100"" by just playing 15 hours a day like most modern day multiplayer shooters. When you die, you have to wait. This is the punishment. You wait, and watch, and learn your enemies tactics, and choice of weapons. You learn who's the best, so that you can save that extra flash bang just for that sucker. This punishment is gives tremendous value to the kill. When the other player is dead, hes gone. He's crying, lighting up a cigarette, going to the bathroom, watching how badass you are, or all of the above. He was eliminated, gone, for 10 minutes. The team tactics are a whole other story. If a team is being plastered by another team with more skilled players, it can make a comeback with team tactics. Team tactics are essential to the success of an average team. Also the level of modifications that this game offers cannot be overlooked. Every weapon has its own characteristics, and your fighting style must adapt to the weapon you have chosen. Yes this is also true with modern shooters, but CS emphasized this more. There are no cheap weapons, no grenade launchers or rocket launchers. Every weapon is completely balanced, and even a hand gun can do the trick if you know how to use it. There is no auto-aim (hello Halo and Call of Duty?) Its you, the mouse, the gun, the target retical, and your enemies face.

This game, is a perfect score of 10, and none less."

> Immediately go to options and setup sensitivity
> Go to public servers, just to get my first feel of the movement
> Filter out the full, empty, and password protected servers
> Not looking for a 32 player server, but one with the right amount of players
> ""10/32""
> Server name is ""somewebsite.ru""
> Looks fine
> I join
> TK'd in seconds
> Kicked
> Russians can't figure out how to password

10/10 Ruskies live up to expectations!"

25367,"Counter Strike is one of the greatest mods for Half Life (and later a standalone game) ever made. The basic idea of the game, is simple. Two teams, Counter-terrorists (police, swat, SAS, and so-on) versus Terrorists in a series of team-based, objective-based highly skill-demanding game modes. The most popular one is probably demolition, where the terrorists need to plant a bomb or kill all of the CTs, and the CTs have to kill all the terrorists before they plant the bomb, or defuse it before it explodes. It is different from most of the other FPS from it's time because of a very punishing yet interesting detail: if you die, you don't respawn until the round ends. Every mistake will have severe consequences for you, and your team. And hell, how easy it is to die on this game. Headshots are common thing. If you get shot, your movement gets debilitated and your opponent has time to finish you off. So you might considering procceeding with caution, with your team, take cover and pay attention to your surroundings. Trying to be a hero and just running guns blazing into a bunch of enemies will only get you killed.

Weapon balance isn't really perfect, let's be honest, there are very few guns that people actually use in this game. But those guns take practice to learn how to use. 

So if you wanted a difficult, team based, competitive FPS where skill matters so much as teamwork, look no further. Go play Counter Strike. Specially if your PC isn't that beefy: CS will run on any modern PC you can find.

Don't be misguided by the old graphics btw. CS's gameplay has aged very well (well, it IS Half-life after all). The interface is responsive, the controls are responsive, and gunplay is amazing. You don't need to be scared of struggling with controls and interfaces. What you need to be wary of, however, is the high learning curve. I suggest you start with bots until you can at least get a hang on how the guns work. Then, try your luck on multiplayer games, but be ready to die a lot before you even get the chance to do anything and have to spectate the rest of the round. It will happen. A lot. It is frustrating, but it also makes the challenge of staying alive until the end much more satisfying."
25368,Still fun to play.
25369,It's still the best Counterstrike in the World.

И так, когда появился контр-страйк впервые на полках с игровыми дисками? С чего началась его история И что представляет собой эта игра в наше время? На все эти вопросы вы получить ответ в нашем обзоре.

25677,"V.alve is corrupted & their company should be closed down, the corrupted from the company need to pay me huge amount of money & they need to be jailed. Valve company should pay many billion of dollars for all their corruption & swindle they was behind.


In cs go, they disable my left click, freeze my screen in important moments, give me team flashers, kickers, griefers, team killers ONLY. They teleport enemies on my screen, if i am behind 5 enemies then all of them teleport to safety. If i am camping & 5 enemies walk ahead of me, then they just teleport over to a door. If enemies is in my crosshair then they teleport out of my crosshair when i shoot, all enemies teleport over my crosshair.
All enemies teleport from a dangerous spot to a safe spot. If there is 2 seconds of walk they would die at, then they teleport over that ''2 seconds of walk spot'' Alot more of these things was happening, they change binds, graphics & settings ingame all the time, i always had sabotaged 100% of my time in cs go + Dota2. When i should be 6k in dota 2 before i even tried the game & global elite MANY years before i tried cs go. They change my binds, sentivity & graphics all the time when i was ingame in cs go + dota2.
Valve company should be closed down for their corruption. valve sholdn't even be alowed to exist, they are corrupted psychopaths sabotaging 100% of my time in dota 2, cs go.
They are even disabling some of my hotkeys & doing that alot when i write reviews, so i need to change everything i wrote becourse 10% of the time one of my keyboard button was disabled by valve.

They are even freezing my screen for 1sec in any pvp game on steam, it just never happen in the many 1000s games i played outside steam.

Valve is corrupted swindlers, just like many other video game companies. 
Video game companies always sabotage my time in pvp games by using my keyboard, disable hotkeys and million of these kind of things."

25727,"First game I ever tried that kept me playing for countless years. Had an insane amount of fun with friends, having LAN's and staying up far too late (or not late enough?).

The core gameplay is an instant hook. Skill based gunplay, nessesity of using proper tactics, large map pool, solid multiplayer connectivity and great visuals (for the time) makes Counter-Strike one of the best shooters of all-time. It sits far up in my personal favourites, and is still played in spirit today!

If you haven't played this yet, it might be worth giving it a good shot. This sets the core principles behind newer CS titles, such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's basic gameplay and map pool. If you can get good at this, you can certainly get pretty decent at that.

25760,best game ever. I missed the good old 56k dial up with this game when CS was still on Valve client. Then we got the DSL connection with only 1mbps/200kbps speed during Steam release. Made a server and 32 ppl joined my game immediately. It was wild. Unfortunately they didn't track any hours played back then. Easily in the 5-10k hours. :(
25761,"i just downloaded the game, changed my video settings its so big i cant play , nor cani change it back!
i just unistalled and re installed 2 times its still blown up please help!"
25762,"Counter-Strike isn't just a game, it's a phenomenon. Originally created by a couple of college students as a downloadable mod for Valve's pioneering 1998 PC first-person shooter, Half-Life, Counter-Strike has more than outlived the game on which it was based and remains one of the most widely played online games in the world, despite being based on 5-year-old technology. Why did Counter-Strike take the world by storm? For one thing, it was free and piggybacked a game that had a huge installed base. But, more importantly, it combined realistic kill-or-be-killed gunplay in a highly competitive, team-oriented environment that featured an incredibly fast, perfectly tuned, arcadelike pace. Much like the way Street Fighter II pioneered the fighting game but was never truly surpassed, so will Counter-Strike remain the once and future king of team-based shooters. Now Microsoft, in partnership with Valve, has brought Counter-Strike to the Xbox, where it's no longer free and no longer as responsive, but, in other respects, is largely the same game as the PC version. It's a bare-bones product that's a missed opportunity, offering no compelling reasons to make it recommendable over the PC version, except to someone with an Xbox Live account and a completely outdated PC. On its own merits, it can make for some good fun online, but if you've never experienced Counter-Strike before, this new version may cause you to wonder what, exactly, all the fuss is about."

If I were to give one problem about this game, the server selection is a little hard, as it is difficult to figure out what server is public-free-to-play servers and what aren't. Also many of the server names are written in chinese and as a person who only understand my native language and english, I could not understand a thing. Plz somebody make english-public server somewhere in asia."
25810,"Old & boring for cs go users, but GG for new users ;)"
25811,Counter Strike is not just a game it is like a family :D
25812,"Examine each version of Counter-Strike and you'll find that not a whole lot has changed since the game's inception as a mod for Half-Life back in 2000. Sure, things like hit boxes, recoil, and aesthetics vary between 1.6, Source, and Global Offensive--but the core, minimalistic gunplay remains intact. And that's one of the beautiful things about this hardcore, competitive shooter: It hasn't changed much in over a decade because it doesn't need to.Counter-Strike is brilliant in its Terrorist vs. Counter-Terrorist execution, as each objective-based match comes down to teamwork, strategy, and pure skill. There is no regenerating health. There are no persistent equipment unlocks. If you die during a round, you stay dead until the next begins. Hell,even being dead in Counter-Strike can be intense when you watch the surviving members of your team rush to plant a bomb or rescue a hostage, knowing they're about to walk into an ambush(Trust Me). More importantly, it's usually during death's spectator phase where your teammates will rally and come up with a new strategy for the next round.

The pacing of its matches not only makes for quick games (unless players whip out a tent and camp their own spawn to ambush enemy search parties), but also promotes teamwork in ways few other shooters do. Take Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, for example. There, as long as you score high, you unlock Perks, Killstreaks, weapons, and equipment, becoming a more efficient killing machine. As a result, players get obsessed with accruing points, even if that means taking an ""every man for himself"" approach to team-centric games.

But Counter-Strike is chess with guns, a level playing field where every player is an integral piece on the perfectly balanced board. Though there are some team-specific weapons (such as the Terrorists' powerful AK-47 or the Counter-Terrorists' M4A1), every firearm is so finely tuned that each side has an equally powerful arsenal. Using an assault rifle? You'll need to learn its firing pattern and burst capabilities. If you pick up an AWP--Counter-Strike's infamous one-hit-killing sniper rifle--you better make that shot count, because an enemy could knife you to death by the time your next bullet enters the chamber. This balance makes it so a player with a pistol could be just as deadly as one with a submachine gun. Learning the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon was (and still is) critical to your CS career. The best part? Even if you're an amazing shot, you probably won't last long without some backup, which brings the experience back full circle.Teamplay blossomed in Counter-Strike's well-designed maps. Admittedly, they weren't all balanced at the start: de_dust was often regarded as a one-sided map that gave Counter-Terrorists the advantage. But as the game evolved, maps like Aztec, Nuke, Office, and Dust2 became the definitive battlegrounds for matches. Every map in Counter-Strike offers a bevy of choke points as well as multiple approaches to any objective, allowing players to plan and execute tons of different strategies. Even years after the game's release, players are finding new ways to take down the opposition.
This balance made Counter-Strike a trailblazer (along with Quake III) for online competitive gaming organizations such as the E-Sports Entertainment Association League. Players formed teams, usually called clans, to practice in scrimmages against one another in hopes of landing that ever-elusive CAL-i invite (a now-defunct invite-only pro league, which was basically Counter-Strike's NFL). Many legends were born through the game, too. Though Johnathan Wendel (who goes by Fatal1ty in the professional scene) got his start in Quake III Arena, he became a feared Counter-Strike legend, and many strived to gain similar recognition. Some, such as Kyle ""ksharp"" Miller and Patrik ""f0rest"" Lindberg, even succeeded.

Of course, Counter-Strike did evolve over time, as Valve released the updated Source and, later, Global Offensive versions, which provided a visual overhaul for the series in addition to minor gameplay tweaks. These updates ruffled some feathers within the community, but many adopted them due to the fact that Valve hadn't tinkered much with the underlying mechanics that had made the game so appealing in the first place. And, because Valve didn't overwrite any pre-existing code when these projects were launched, everyone who loved Counter-Strike could continue playing whichever version they preferred. You can still hop into a 1.6 match nine years after its release to experience a familiar glimpse at the game's earlier years.

Perhaps Counter-Strike's greatest achievement is that it's a testament to what the modding community is capable of. It did, after all, begin as a mod for Half-Life--a mod that Valve later purchased the rights to and developed into a fully realized game. There were even mods within the mod. Counter-Strike is where the popular Gun Game mode was born; there were player-made ""Protect the VIP"" modes, and tons of user-generated zombie survival games, which went on to inspire Valve's Left 4 Dead series.
Even now, the Counter-Strike community continues to expand as more and more mods are introduced. Owning a copy of any version of the game means you have access to tons of player-made ones--and who knows which of these will be adopted into full games, or inspire new modes in already-popular shooters?

Counter-Strike is undoubtedly influential, but it's also one of the most intelligent shooters ever designed. It has incredibly tight and balanced gunplay, amazing map composition, and supports one of the largest modding communities out there. Sure, it doesn't have fancy unlocks or a score-driven economy--but the fact that it still has a substantial playerbase 12 years after its inception says a lot about its design. It's a game that refuses to adopt the trends of its competitors. Much like its community, Counter-Strike is resistant to change. That's fine with us. It doesn't need to. <3"

25822,"Timeless classic. 

I think most of us have already played / tried this game. Do you remember those old school days when we used to use mIRC to get private lobby and play the game we all enjoy? Even tho, now most of us has already moved on. However, even now sometimes I launch this game just for the purpose of curiousity to check how many servers are populated. If you don't own this game yet, you are better to buy the newer one, csgo. It doesn't mean that it's not worth playing. I mean, if you have extra money, then why not. It just geting older and less people are playing it. Despite that, it's an amazing game and you should really try it if you haven't. 


Oh and don't pay much of attention on how many hours I've played. I bought this game very long time ago and for some reason I didn't play it on my account :)"

Thanks to my friend who give me this game. (including CSCZ tho)"
25894,"Lets be honest, I only wrote this review to gain awards"
25895,I was only 2 months old at the release of this game but I can tell you for sure I pre-ordered the game and it was more than excellent. I still have great nostalgia from that day onwards.

25914,Nostalgic.
25915,"Es ist und bleibt der klassische First-Person-Shooter. Jeder der FPS spielt sollte dieses Spiel besitzen oder wenigstens mal in den Genuß gekommen sein dieses Spiel zu spielen. Auch wenn die Grafik und die Physik schon lange nicht mehr dem heutigen Level entsprechen, lohnt es sich denn noch CS 1.6 zu spielen. Hier kommt das richtige Shooter Feeling auf, man wird nicht von irgendwelchen hoch detaillierten Texturen oder Objekten abgeleckt, wie das in den heutigen FPS der Fall ist und den Gegner schwerer erkennbar macht. Hier kann sich komplett auf die Taktik und den Gegner konzentriert werden. Da Counter-Strike 1.6 meine ganze Jugend geprägt hat was gaming angeht, ist es und bleibt es mein lieblings PC-Game"

Counter Terrorists Slugfeast with a wide veriaty of weapons. This is a timeless game which no sequal will over-run or takeover. Expect to use up hundreds of hours slaving over this game.

25959,pls guys dont but this game
25960,"csgo: 12 years olds flaming you for missing a shot, also, apparently, they all had sexual relationship with at least one of your family members/friends.

css: large variety of people, always having a good time

cscz: let's be honest, the only reason why it's written down here is so that it won't feel lonely

cs1.6: 20-30 years old people throwing the most creative and vulgar insults at you they possibly can, along with the occasional squaker who gets burnt within .1 second of them pressing the mic key. good place to pick up foreign insults other than russian.

26185,"Good ol' CS 1.6. While the competative play is not as heavily developed compared to the current CS - Global Offenive, the servers you could find were waaay better, because that was the main focus of this game. You had a lot of mods to choose from. My personal favourite were BF2 mods were you could gain badges with certain features like increased jump, etc. for aquiring achivements. That's still something this game holds over the CS:GO, because as far as I could see the servers in the new version were lacking a lot of features."

26227,"One day in Winter, I got 2 $20 Steam Gift Cards. I wanted to stack up on Valve games to binge play... So I did. I didn't have much money left and wanted to buy 1 last Valve game, I decided to buy Counter-Strike. Knowing that CSGO tore a huge time of my 2015 and 2016 year, I thought that ""Hey, I'll play CS:GO more anyway"", I bought it anyway. I downloaded it and played for an hour, that hour was probably the scariest time in my Counter-Strike life having known that there were REALLY good players that played. After that, I decided to forget about CS 1.6 (Oh did I regret that). Later this year, I found it in my library strangely installed (even though I remember un-installing it) and decided to play. I played for about 4 hours straight and was getting the basics. I went to Condition Zero because I heard it had bot support. i have more hours on CZ than on real CS 1.6 lol. I got good and thought I could fight against the big boys! I was wrong.  But hey, I did shoot the top killer in the head with a USP-S. 10/10 would shoot top killer in the face again CS 1.6> CSGO"

26323,"So here's a little story.
Before my dad and my mom got a divorce, and before I was even born, my mom would work late nights at the the hosipital (she was a nurse), leaving my dad home alone. He wouldn't really have anything to do so one day, he went to the store and bought Counter-Strike (it was back then when you needed a disc to play; steam wasn't around yet). and he would play until she got home. 14 years later on Saturday, April 15th 2017, he personally bought me and my little brother copies of Counter-Strike so we can all play together. 
This game brought my family closer together ever since the divorce.
10/10, best game ever.

26350,"What can I say today about Counter Strike? A perfect control of first person shooter dynamics with a simple role playing without a story: good guys vs. bad guys. Special forces vs. Terrorists. The world was tired of big scale conflicts in the real life and in videogames, then, we will meet the brushes of little armies with unknown political ideas but strong motivations, against elite forces of the international interventionism around the world. A skirmish that guarantees infinite hours of respawns, shoots, strategic gaming or a fool shoot'em up party.
 
Do you need anymore to play convinced that you are doing right, and taking a lot of fun of this?

Today, this is an ""Opus Dei"", a perfect job. Still working and a lot of players enjoying it.

Because of this, Counter Strike 1.6 always will be on my disk."

26384,"The now legendary Counter-Strike 1.6!

This is NOT a game you buy if you are on the search for amazing graphics, because it is honestly far from it.
This game has survived all these years mostly because of its astonishingly addictive simplicity.

If you look at Call of Duty for example, it offers a wide variety of game modes. Where as Counter-Strike 1.6 simply has 2 game modes:

“Casual”
You pick a team: CT/T = Counter-Terrorist / Terrorist
The CTs goal is to either eliminate all the players on the T side (within the rounds time limit) or defuse a bomb (if the terrorists manage to plant one)

The Ts goal is to either eliminate all the players on the CT side (within the rounds time limit) or plant a bomb and successfully blow it up.

There are 2 spots the terrorists can plant the bomb on and they are called ""A"" and ""B"" (They are usually located at each side of the map) In the case of a bomb plant, the round time gets replaced by a visualized ticking bomb icon until it blows up or gets defused.

Every player starts with 100 HP (health points) at the beginning of each round (If you die, you remain dead until the next round)
You have your own economy that you can use to buy weapons and equipment.
You earn money for every kill you manage to get + everyone in a team gets a bonus for each round they manage to win.

""Deathmatch""  (Deathmatch is basically aim/reaction practice with fast paced action and no waiting time)
Here you also pick a team: CT/T
-No bomb plants
-No earned money
-100 HP (If you die, you immediately respawn and keep going to grind more kills)

The in-game menu is as simplistic as the gameplay itself:

New Game = Play offline alone or with friends on a local server (For example to learn maps or just have some fun)
Find Servers = Play online with players all over the world (Casual, Deathmatch or the mod versions)
Options = Here you change the settings for the game
Quit = Self-explanatory

So this has been going on and on and on in so many different public servers across the world for over a decade now!
It got to the point where players spent so much time to learn everything that they became professionals and thus LIVE coverage of CS matches started and it quickly became a major hit worldwide!
The matches were 5on5 compared to regular public matches where the limit of players are set by the server owners.

A game-changing moment was the implementation of mods. It has played a significant role in retaining the interest of this beloved game and revitalizing it with fresh new content such as hns (hide n seek), kz (climb maps, invented by a player called Kreedz) surf, zombie, jailbreak, football etc..
This sparked the creative nature within many people and ended up giving the whole CS community a HUGE load of maps in various genres!

So in the end of this review I just want to say when it comes to the now legendary Counter-Strike 1.6, it is SO much more to it than what meets the eye ;)"

26419,"Counter-Strike 1.6 was released a long time ago. The game revolutionized the world of multiplayer games and eSports and 17 years after his release date you can still see how 1.6 changed things. 

My first FPS game was some sort of FTP Facebook game , but my real first FPS was CS.GO . When I was a kid I loved to play some Nintendo games but almost 3 years ago I started playing CS:GO with my friends. I started to play that game everyday and it was my main game , but after some years , my HP Laptop just couldn´t hold it with the map graphics updates and that stuff. 

That´s when I started my passion for ""Old"" games , I looked for a solution and found out a 10$ pack that included 1.6,Source and both CS:CZ. And of course , my laptop could run those games. 

I didn´t know that I was going to love ""Old"" games so I started to play the most recent one before CS:GO , which was Source. After 40 hours of playing I got bored because there weren´t many Portuguese players and friends that played the game. I wen´t doing some research and found out that 1.6 was the most played of those games game by Portuguese people. I was confused because the game was old , the graphics were awful , etc... But apart from those things , there was a big Portuguese community around the game and there were so many good players and friends to play with. 

I started to love the game and my passion for ""Old"" games was increasing and I started to play more ""Old"" games. I could see the influence that 1.6 had in the games community. 

Nowadays , I have a new PC and I´m currently playing other modern games , but I still love to get back in 1.6 and just chill for some hours. 

This is probably the best game ever to be released and it changed so much."

26434,"This is where Valve has created the seed of STEAM as we know it today. Without games like this, STEAM wouldn't be here today and would NOT exist if it wasn't for the Original Half-Life game that was created long before STEAM as ever created.

I have the privledge now to glorify the original game to restore to it's former glory. It has been since tarnished but we feel it can be restored to it's natural beauty again and from me personal experience it is something that it's HOME to me where I would live for the rest of my life and noone can take that HOME away from me.

As for being a wickedly awesome game, sure it may not have the visual appeal anymore, but the classical feeling is unrivalled to all and that kind of feeling is a Treasure for all Counter-Strike Veterans who enjoyed the beauty and the pinnacle of the game, And we take pride that even today we veterans of Counter-Strike still like to brag about the STEAMID Numbers that 6 digits or less you are called a King of Counter-Strike along with 15 year old steam accounts which makes this pretty much a monument to Valve Corp.

It's there for the taking, if you choose to buy this game, you will remember it being for the better and not for the worst. For all counter-strike verterans we salute you for enjoying this game, the other counter-strike releases are not as impactful apart from Counter-Strike : Global Offensive is that noone can take that feeling away from the original. Sure Condition Zero was supposed to be the next step, but I feel that if anyone is willing to invest rebuilding Condition Zero into a better game while keeping the original mechanics to the game I would praise you for that.

Anyways it's my journey what made me want to play this game once again, it's just ART. The original Counter-Strike to whom people play is purely a work of ART."

26442,"Ahh, good old memories. Even if it has a big age, this game is awesome. It has lots of mods, plugins and addons which you can play with and have a lot of fun. A few example of my favorite mods are: Kreedz, Zombie, Deathmatch, Gungame, WC3FT, Bhop, Co-op and many more. Unfortunately, people nowadays might think it's just old so they don't play it or at least give it a try, a thing which heartbreaks me... But anyway, it's worth spending time on this game and I think you won't regret it eventually if you have somebody to play with too. :)"

26489,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:

I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.

Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.

I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. 

I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.
I love this game. 1443 hours let know about this..."
26490,LOL
26491,I approve
26492,Very epic
26493,Imagine if valve would delete CS:GO for 1 week and how many gamers will back to cs 1.6

26576,Best Game Ever Played
26577,"Imagine playing CSGO but with terrible graphics, people killing you randomly through the walls, no matchmaking system and malicious servers that'll rebind your keybinds to send you to their server without your consent. -- That's CS1.6

This game is completely and totally deprecated in 2020 because of CSGO.  CSGO is better than this game in every way from gameplay, easy of finding servers, matchmaking and more secure servers.  Basically, this game sucks and it's old.  Play the new game instead."

[b]S[/b] • 7/10 | Great game to start a great franchise.
[b]P[/b] • 4/10 | Plays like Half-Life and has poor mechanics and sounds.
[b]E[/b] • 4/10 | Can not endure the game anymore with it's outdated engine and graphics.
[b]C[/b] • 3/10 | Frustrating game with professional community to destroy new players.
[b]I[/b] • 4/10 | Not much thinking involved, pretty mindless.
[b]A[/b] • 3/10 | Play time varies based on peoples standards.
[b]L[/b] • 4/10 | Mostly skill with very little luck involved in this game.

[h1]Original Review[/h1]
Hello Fellow Soldiers,
This is easily a game that I have not played all that much. It was a great game for when it came out, and it's a lot of fun for what it is! Overall, the graphics and hitboxes are very poor, and I'm not going to recommend this game. Overall, I got this game in the Valve Complete Pack and I tried it because it was the first game that would spark the legendary Counter-Strike series. For the time it was great, now I'd recommend either getting Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or Counter-Strike: Source. I'm not going to recommend this game because there are newer and better versions of it out.

26690,"Counter-Strike (shortened sometimes to CS) is a tactical first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation which originated from a Half-Life modification by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le and Jess ""Cliffe"" Cliffe. The game has been expanded into a series since its original release, which currently includes Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Counter-Strike pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing the mission objective or eliminating the opposing force.
The game was the most played Half-Life modification in terms of players, according to GameSpy in 2008.[2]
As of August 2011, the Counter-Strike franchise has sold over 25 million units
Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or becomes a spectator. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.
A player can choose to play as one of four different default character models (four for each side, although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as ""freeze time"") to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. (one notable exception is that a player may receive damage during freeze time. This happens when a map is changed to spawn players at a certain height above the ground, thus causing fall damage to the player. This is a method map designers use to alter the starting ""HP"" of players on a map). They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral ""buy zones"" that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment."

My name is Sikander and i am from Pakistan.

i do very like this game because it has good steam graphics + it has mutli modes like Zombie , HnS , CoD , Bhop etc
whatever i want i can play with CS 1,6, Steam did a good job for games and they are really hard working on their games.

26716,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.

Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.

Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work."

26887,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously. All players have only one life by default and start with a pistol as well as a knife.

The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:

Bomb defusal: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion.
Hostage rescue: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion.
Assassination: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.
A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as ""freeze time"") to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral ""buy zones"" that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.

Standard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb (Terrorist) or defusing the bomb (Counter-Terrorist).

The scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and ping (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.

Killed players become ""spectators"" for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players, and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of Internet cafes and Voice over IP programs such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo). This form of cheating is known as ""ghosting."""

Negative things:
Graphics (but you can add modifications to it (Just skins, not hacks.. That's why i have VAC :^) .)), Sometimes I had issues with hitboxes (but it depends on player models you use),  nowadays you can meet a lot of hackers in MP..

Note: I have over 10k hours in non-steam.. I think valve should add competetive games , that would be interesting

26963,"It was first thought of as a mod for Half-Life, which was released in 1998 and can be regarded as the ancestor of the FPS genre. Words are not enough ...

26971,"So, why do I recommend CS 1.6?

In the first place, it's a Counter-Strike. ''Nuff said.

Also, it's really cheap (10$/€ with CS:CZ, really worth it, although I bought it in the 2016 Winter Sale).

However, there are some slowhackers(basically people who will mess with your config). It is, nevertheless, easily fixable.

Consider though, if you like next-gen graphics, DO NOT buy this game( It was released fully in 2000, but was a Beta in 1999).

There'll be also some Fire in the Hole spamming(it's fun to do so, due to the monotone radio sounds).

Plus, there's the mighty MP5.

And cut!"

27007,"Recommended since 1999, its the original CS. One of the best games ever. Ever. 
This marks the Beginning of Modern PC Gaming Era.

All of the Counter Strike games are Gems to be played and collected - CS is a part of the Worlds History of Gaming, having completely set the standars for modern gaming back in 1999/2000 and still raising the bar nowadays.

It is all multiplayer based - lauched officialy 17 years ago!
And its so crazy good, that you will still find an average of 18k people playing each night (check steamdatabase).

I've played it since the LAN Houses time with CS beta 7 (the one where they added Dual Berettas, cs_Office and de_Vegas... Also two first shots from you eagle were kinda blind - SO MANY MEMORIES)
Had to buy the Half Life CD (Orange) and get the serial key to be able to play CS Mod and DoD Mod.

Wrote this review mostly to remind you fellow gamers how perfect and how happy we were during the first CS era."

27052,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.

Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.

Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.

Personal Rating: 10/10"
27053,"I'm not sure if it's just because the individual gameplay elements are infinitely more consistent than in GO and therefore place a stronger emphasis on hard work and skill than rng and overpriced new skins, but I don't end every 1.6 game I play in a fit of confused and disappointed rage, which is refreshing."

Can anyone believe CS started out as a mod? I don't.

The game physics, the graphics and especially the story of Half-Life were absolutely outstanding.

To make a long story short, after wonderful moments with Half-Life 2,
I'm still playing CS:GO in 2016. 
So Half-Life is the source of all my FPS gaming experience and it's still great.

Pros:
+Awesome Gameplay
+Intense battles , defusing/planting bombs
+ Left a large trace in the gaming history.
+ Counter Strike series is one of the best FPS Shooters of all time.

Cons:
-Servers are bugged
-Even though you join them you might be kicked and redirected to another one.

27254,I have had it for 12 years and it is still amazing
27255,"Well what can i say about CS1.6 ?
If you never played it, you are not an old school gamer.
This game was much popular before 4-5 years, now it have only about 500k 24/7 players.
Keep reading, i will also explain my opinion why CS:GO have much more players when cs1.6 is better.
Half-Life: Counter-Strike is one of the most unusual PC game released in years.
The hugely popular mod for Valve Software's Half-Life has been available for free download for well over a year, and you can still download it for free off the Internet now that it's been through beta testing and has reached version 1.0. 
Counter-Strike divides players into teams of terrorists and counterterrorists in four game modes: rescue/hold hostages, bomb target/defuse bomb, escape from/guard an area, and assassinate/guard a VIP. 
Also, today is some gamemodes like Zombie/BaseBuilder/Zombie Escape/JailBreak/Surf which is very interesting and will take hours of your life !
Each weapon has unique characteristics, so mastering them all and learning which is best for different situations is a lot of fun. To buy a weapon you normally need money $$. To get money, kill the enemies or you can get it on the round start.
Half-Life is originally created by a couple of college stundents as a downloadable mod. 
A heart-pounding, visceral experience that gets under your skin. The [b]""just one more round""[/b] addiction factor is very high. 
When you play it properly, with team work that clicks like a well-oiled machine, the game offers a sense of accomplishment and comradery that is simply amazing.
Years ago, Counter-Strike 1.6 had tournaments just like Dota 2/CS:GO/League of Legends, and teams like Na'Vi always winned just like now we can see SKT T1 winning League of Legends every game.
I don't prefer CS:GO because of russians or polaks, i don't prefer League of Legends because of polaks or spanians and i don't prefer Dota 2 because of russians. But, in this game you can play only with teammates from your country.
Sites like gametracker.rs or gametracker.com is giving you possibility to see servers and stats of servers in your country or worldwide.
There is some guns you can't buy as Counter-Terrorist(CT) just as some guns you can't buy as a Terrorist(TT).
The terrorists get the Galil(B-4-1), an Israeli gun that is a take off of the more popular AK-47(B-4-2),. It’s rather accurate and with a magazine capacity of 35 rounds, means you’ll still be able to be shooting while your opponent has to reload. (Unless you’re a noob and spray like a fire hose all over the place)”.
In CT you get the Famas(B-4-1) and M4-A-1(B-4-3). Ofc there is much weapons avaiable to both of teams.
The game was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004.
The fourth game in the main series to have been developed by Valve, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Besides Russians, i don't prefer CS:GO because it's a [b]COPY[/b] of Counter-Strike 1.6 
I guess you will say something like ""Why don't u prefer CS:GO instead of CS1.6, CS:GO is better because CS:GO have much more players."" Why CS:GO have more players? Only because of skins. If there is skins in Counter-Strike 1.6 - cs1.6 would be much more popular than CS:GO.
The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first version of Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification for Half-Life and designed by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le and Jess ""Cliffe"" Cliffe, before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.
Originally a modification for Half-Life, the rights to Counter-Strike, as well as the developers working on it, were acquired by Valve Corporation in 2000.
The game received a port to Xbox in 2003. It was also ported to OS X and Linux in the form of a beta in January 2013. A full release was published in April 2013.
There is also some copies like Counter Strike 1.6: Nexon Zombies or cs1.6 neo.
I think there is no reason for creating CON's or PRO's because.. 
I am playing this game for about 7-8 years so don't look at my playtime, i play'd cs1.6 warzone avaiable online because of much bigger FPS :)

10/10

27266,its quite addicting :> very good game
27267,"Must have game for a FPS gamer.
All time Legend."
27268,"Fun, simple multiplayer FPS gameplay with graphics so basic that even a potato with wires poking out could run it. Still some active servers, even after all these years. Every gamer of culture should own this."
27269,"Muito bom! O game continua agradando bastante, mesmo após vários anos de lançamento, graças à sua excelente jogabilidade e intuição do game. Que a Steam continue otimizando o suporte online para o game, não o deixando de lado!"
27270,"great game, if you like counter strike in any you should give this one a try"
27271,"Eu sunt pasionat de acest, dovada fiind faptul că îl joc de câțiva ani buni. Totuși sunt dezamagit de comportamentul jucatorilor români, nu toți, majoritatea… pe orice server exista certuri, injuraturi si scandaluri și chiar poate fără să faci nimic te alegi cu injuri. Dar în rest , jocul rămâne în continuare cel mai jucat joc chiar și luând in considerare CS:GO, SOURCE, tot 1.6 rămâne în inimile noastre, doar cu el am copilărit.. posibil principalele motive pentru care jocul acesta este așa de jucat, pot fi:
- nu are cerințe mari;
- nu costă chiar așa mult;
- te poți juca alături de prieteni
- foarte ușor de jucat pentru orice jucător..
- grafica..acceptabilă
Recomand cu drag acest joc. GL & HF!"

27280,Good game !! Pleaze Half Life 3!!
27281,"Awesome fighting strategy  game . people used to said that cs 1.6 is dead play global offensive ,but by playing 1.6 on steam I understood that how many players R now active to play 1.6 however ho is also good game"
27282,Nice one ! But not best one! See you IN CS:GO !
27283,Oldschool <3
27284,"This game is amazingly perfect and amazing. The best koderiai GintarelioNNNN a.k.a Gintareliss1ck a.k.a GintaraLaLa a.k.a loh jibanij ,rapidas ,pidisas ,cruelis ,zenpaj even a fag named Mocking they made this game amaizing. When you come to public server and old school koderis who is banned on mixailt and mixnet rapidas calls you a cheater (pm me for screenshots) it's amaizing. If you want to get a big laugh create a team and play against totally legit team called LoFi. But all great players aside there's still some old school players from 2000 and 2009 these old mans can't even aim properly so don't take big L trying to become good aimer and team leader and become koderis you are guaranteed to take a big W if you don't pasigausi."
27285,its a Good FPS Game Soo Hard And A Fun Game :) i Love it
27286,My fav game this game will never die
27287,"Best Multiplayer first person shooter game of all time because nothing comes close to this, the more you play this game the more addicted you become and moreover it is fun at all levels of ability. Especially, as you do not need a high end gaming rig to run it, that makes it a game for everyone who likes competitive first person shooter which involves thinking and good aiming skills instead of mindless slaying. It combines the best of team based gaming with an authentic and therefore exciting approach to tactical ops. The ""just one more round"" addiction factor is very high. When you play it properly, with team work that clicks like a well-oiled machine, the game offers a sense of accomplishment and comradery that is simply amazing. Buy it, download it, whatever; just get on board and enjoy it. Sure-fire fun for the online enthusiast. 10/10"
27288,1.6 looks like
27289,"""Fire in the hole""
10/10 would fire again"
27290,Oh I miss the old times
27291,"This game is what started my PC gaming addiction, I love it to death and always will."
27292,Hehe CS best :D
27293,"The Classic shooter. A must buy to revisit some of Counter-Strike's most iconic game-play.

The classic shooter upgraded with modern controls: Counter-Strike was something unseen, yet highly needed in the late 90's and early 00's. It carried with it the idea that you didn't need a single player ""story mode"" to make ripples in the video game industry. As future competitors would attempt to reflect, all CS needed was an incredible skill-based gameplay with a start-of-the-art ability to play against players from around the world. Toss in some alternate gameplay styles to help break up the chance of monotonous moments and throw it all over a large assortment of levels for good measure; you’ll end up with a dish that, for years, has been best served with a dedicated server and a good group of friends. It's no wonder that CS gave birth to some of the best online team play the world has ever seen and continues in that tradition to this day. If you haven't played the original Counter-Strike yet, you're missing a small part of your soul... hurry, go get it back by quick scoping with an AWP down Long A on de_dust2."

27314,Good game
27315,"Examine each version of Counter-Strike and you'll find that not a whole lot has changed since the game's inception as a mod for Half-Life back in 2000. Sure, things like hit boxes, recoil, and aesthetics vary between 1.6, Source, and Global Offensive--but the core, minimalistic gunplay remains intact. And that's one of the beautiful things about this hardcore, competitive shooter: It hasn't changed much in over a decade because it doesn't need to, making it one of our top 100 games of all time."

27449,"The original uncut realistic-competetive shooter. Back in the days, just after the release of Half-Life, two people decided to create a mod based on this immensly popular game. Little did they know that they were about to create the best shooter to date. Many of those who joined after the hype died down, or rather in newer times will probably not understand, and most likely hate on this game. However, this is the father of the Counter-Strike series, aka the second most popular esport scene. This game spawned many legends, and truly deserves the place it has gotten. A master-piece few other games could ever even hope to compare with.

TL;DR
If you are buying this now, you're a bit late fella. However, if you want to buy it to experience how the newer titles should have been, only with better graphics ect. Feel free.

Overall score, along with Half-Life, 11/10."

27466,"Counter-Strike (also known as Half-Life: Counter-Strike) is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. It was initially developed and released as a Half-Life modification by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le and Jess Cliffe in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. Counter-Strike was first released by Valve on the Microsoft Windows platform in 2000. The game later spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the Counter-Strike series. Several remakes and Ports of Counter-Strike have been released on the Xbox console, as well as OS X and Linux. It is sometimes referred to as Counter-Strike 1.6 to distinguish it from other titles of the series, 1.6 being the final major software update the game received.

Set in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams of the governmental counter-terrorist forces and various terrorist militants opposing them. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives, or else eliminating all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.

The game that made me play it everyday since the first time I laid my eyes on it in 2009.
Sure it might seem filled with hackers these days, but I'm happy to see that it's still played majorly.
I feel bad for not buying it on steam on my first account instead of playing the cracked version, but I sure will when I have the money.
When I put it all together I get around 5k hours of non-stop fun, stress(the good one :D), intensity & love.
Too bad CS:GO is ruining the Counter-Strike name, sometimes the simplest things are the best.
Thank you Counter-Strike for existing & don't ever be forgotten!"

27595,"I like this game, just that its hard to get used to, it will probably take me a week or so, I am used to the modern game feel, such as CS:GO, but this is still a game you can play. People aren't that toxic like in modern games, they are really chill. The thing I hate is the price, it isn't worth 9.99 USD, its more worth 5-6 USD, I would suggest to wait for another Steam sale, or the price to finally drop. But if your looking for a chill community, want to have fun and a retro 90s-2000s feel, Counter Strike 1.6 is for you."

27606,"Counter-Strike (officially abbreviated as CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists battle to, respectively, perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking) and prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first version of Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification for Half-Life and designed by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le and Jess ""Cliffe"" Cliffe, before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.

The game was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. Later that same year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released only eight months after Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, in November 2004, the game was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.[1] The fourth game in the main series to have been developed by Valve, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who also worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[2] Several spin-off titles have been released for Asian territories."

Too bad I dont have my old Steam account to boast about how I was the MASTER. A lot has changed since. I tried CS: GO. I like it, but it will never compare to the euphoria I experience with the original. I don't hate people for the negative reviews. I just know that they were not the One for the original CS. It takes a special breed to love something when it is at it's infancy. New to the world but striving to make a difference. To all who share my undying love for the original, I salute."

The over all graphics are lacking by today's standards which I assume would cause some people to hate this game. I never got into the game competitively so I can't really say where or not it is properly balanced. The majority of maps are a bit bland when compared to CSS or CSGO, they lack a lot of the newer ladders/sniper nests."

27756,"One of the greatest games to ever grace the planet earth. The community wasn't as toxic as most gaming societies. Hackers were such a rarity, at least the blatant ones were. Modified servers such as Superhero, Warcraft 3, Soccerjam, Football Jam ect, were all great additions to just playing the game in casual servers. Of course the competitive side of the game was obviously the best part. Hitting the spam spot, or just hitting somebody with that classic Deagle was just something special to experience. I'm glad I was able to say I was apart of the game when it was at its highest point. Without a doubt one of the best games I can say I've ever played. As sad as it may sound, I've had some really memorable experiences in this game whether it be through the clans I've progressed through or the relationships I was able to not just build but able to keep throughout all these years. Would give a 10/10 every freaking time..and I would recommend this game to most people if it still had a solid community around it, but I think that you future players might just be too late to experience one of the best shooters ever."

27767,"If you were looking for a review of this game. I'm sorry. But if you were looking for information about the Oecophylla smaragdina (common names include weaver ant, green ant, green tree ant, and orange gaster). You may want to read this!

Oecophylla smaragdina has a widespread distribution in tropical Asia and Australia, its range extending from India through Indonesia and the Philippines to Northern Territory and Queensland in Australia. It is an arboreal species, making its nests among the foliage of trees. Nests are constructed during the night, with major workers weaving towards the exterior and minor workers completing the interior structure. The ant colony may have several nests in one tree, or the nests may be spread over several adjacent trees. In one instance, a colony occupied 151 nests distributed among twelve trees. The queen is located in one of these nests, and her progeny are carried between them and distributed to other nests. The average life of a mature colony may be eight years."

27805,"      The classic Counter Strike is amongst the best games I have played when I was younger. I've spent hours upon hours on servers and bots. I had a crush on this game.
      Deleted Scenes, aah. I feel dirty for playing this in 2017 but this game is addictively fun. I got this for free when I bought the classic Counter Strike, so I gave it a shot. Even though I almost have 2k hours on CSGO and many hours on the pirated version of cs 1.6, I still find this campaign challenging and fun. It doesn't have a story, it's made out of multiple missions that you play as different soldiers every time but that does not take away from the fun. A downside is that you cant bhop but whatever. It brings me back to the good ol games of my childhood. Recommend"

часы потраченные на эти игры, потрачены не зря
моменты когда ты убиваешь через стенку в голову
когда тебя называют читером, но на самом деле ты играл без читов

а также заводишь новых друзей с которыми можно играть бесконечно

27895,"Never have been a huge CS fan. Never used to be a legitamate player.

That's where Counter-Strike 1.5/1.6 comes into play.  Among the other Counter-Strike games I have cheated within them, multiple accounts, and have been banned more than my 2 year old sister can count. By the way, she can count to 22. After been given the opportunity to try the very first, at least on Steam, Counter-Strike 1.5/1.6, I have come to realize that I have no need to cheat. I can play this game on a competitive skill and strive to be better.

Do I recommend it? Yes.

Much more to say besides it turned me to be a legitmate player? No.

That should say enough.

Buy it, it's cheap. Good for its price and it will make you play legitmate."
27896,"This is where a new era began: LAN parties, steam and computer games in the media.
Bought again for nostalgic reasons, but a must buy for everyone who grew up with it."
27897,Good game
27898,"-Community is still strong, worldwide or regional.
-Different learning curve with weapons
-A little outdated (Runs on Gold Source, AKA Half-Life's engine)
-People are reasonably chill
-This game has the ethnicity diversity of fuckin' Baskin Robbins
-Endless plethora of DUST2 ONLY servers, with NO AWP, NO AUTO (Of course)
-Recieve Condition-Zero and Condition-Zero Deleted Scenes upon purchase (Pretty much the same game)
-My opinion for Condition-Zero is exactly the same, player count may vary on that game.
-If settings are of certain condition, you may fuck up the .exe file.(I'll update once I remember how to do it again)
-This game got a kid transfered to a different school for making a map of his school back in 2007. See the video for more details:

27933,"Don't get fooled by the amount of hours steam currently displayed. I once played a crack of this for days and now that I have bought it, I want to share some thoughts. This is an overall good game and is the root for every CS game in the future, which in itself is already a good thing in my book. Although there are some problems, like not including bots (since I'm always not going to have internet constantly). But all in all, I like it. 8/10 Recommend for old CS players looking for nostalgia."

27967,"This was one of the games of my childhood played alot of it in Internet Cafe`s, the other two where Quake 3 and Carmagheddon. 

Back then it was fun, hard to master and a way to make friends. After today and many kicks, maps/mods downloading, server redirection (over and over) and players appearing out of nowhere (just around the corner that was safe),  i consider this game (in its current version) a real waste of time and a big disappointment.

After today i consider Counter-Strike just a poor man`s alternative to CS:GO, both in terms of price and hardware requirements.

27983,"Counter-Strike (officially abbreviated as CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists battle to, respectively, perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking) and prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first version of Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification for Half-Life and designed by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le and Jess ""Cliffe"" Cliffe, before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.

The game was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. Later that same year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released only eight months after Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, in November 2004, the game was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.[1] The fourth game in the main series to have been developed by Valve, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who also worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[2] Several spin-off titles have been released for Asian territories."

27991,"I would have given this is a ""No"" but I remembered lan play is still good ( obviously ).
Multiplayer is basically dead, there are some good servers but they lag too much for me because they're too far from me and the local servers are either slowhack servers or require some third-party anti-cheat tool even though VAC is already enough.

I'm still recommending it because I love this game anyways and I just play CZ if I want to play online, that has local decent servers."

- Opens game
- Fall in love immediately
- Realize I suck
- Play for 4 hours straight without a kill
- Finally gets a kill
- Gets cursed at in spanish
- Gets kicked from server

28091,awesome...
28092,"Okay, this is the first time I am writing a review about a game. Counter-Strike is a very good game, if you know what server(s) ur gonna play in, and what server you're play style suites. Might be hard finding them, but if you do find them it wil be very good game experience. The bad thing about the game is that it's glitchy, but what do you expect of a retro shooting game? I personal prefer gameplay, above graphics, glitches and bugs. And when it comes to gameplay the game counter-strike, exceeds above all new style shooting games from today. 

Do I recommand this game? The answer is yes because it's gameplay is unique, additing, and so simple. That your need of a fastpaced action game is met to your liking. 

This concludes my review of counter-strike, I hope my review was helpful. But the best thing to do is to try the game out, before you know exactly what the game is all about, and what game experience you might get from it."

28288,"I absolutely loved this game back in 2007. It was more enjoyable as a kid who doesn't know whats going on inside and always get hyped whenever he/she sees an enemy. From my experience of the game when I was young, I get excited by just shhoting glass..I mean..who doesn't, come on now. It is 2016 now and I've gotten a chance to have it on steam. The only odd thing about the game now are the aimmimg part. Now I've been practically gaming on PC in experience and this one is just something. Its either my mouse or just something thats giving me a hard time. Whileplaying (maybe you should use a mousepad after 7 years dumbass). Anyways, steam community comes in and ruins the game. I also couldn't connect to US servers other than Venezuelan servers which is FILLED with Spanish/Hispanic music blow my eardrums up. I just want to rate this game 6/10 for the steam version. I've only played LAN in this game back then still if I want to play an old game in a future generation, I gotta get use to this upside down generation."

28344,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.

Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.

Counter-Strike is a good game. I recommend this game.

28389,"Blame this game for the rise of the online multiplayer modern military shooter. Good game, great custom maps, terrible community. Not much has really changed since 2000, has it?

I don't think anyone still plays this particular version of CS though.

Edit: Wait, there are over 8,000 people in-game right now. Wow... guess I have to give this a ""yes"" then because it isn't dead."
28390,"Horrible, just horrible. Everyone gives this good reviews based on nostalgia. I saw all the good reviews and thought I should try it out. Upon opening the game, was a cringy menu. I fiddle with the settings, and theres no damn graphics options! I put the crosshair on small.(Definitely not small) So, I go to servers and all the servers have horrible maps. Plus, closest servers had 0 players. I click on a Dust 2 server with 10 players. When it loads up, nobody speaks fucking english. The buy menu controls were so fucked up I couldnt buy a gun. So, I stuck with the pistol. I go through the middle, and all the players look the same! You cant even tell who's who. Literally, the fucking same. So I die instantly because i couldn't even tell it was an enemy. Bullshit. I finally managed to buy a gun in the fucked up menu. I find someone, spray at em', and surprisingly it was enemy. My gun starts shooting in the fucking sky, recoil over 9000, and I was burst firing! Absolute bullshit. Another HORRIBLE thing about this game, its graphics and audio! It just doesnt meet todays standards. I think I might have to bleach my eyes after glancing at this game. Its horrible. I only played the game for under 10 minutes and I already want to kill my self. Trust me, save your money. If you loved this game as a kid, I dont care get it. But if youre looking for a good FPS, to TODAYS standards, dont get this garbarge! Save your ten dollars and use it to get your dick sucked by the girl down the street. So, simplest way possible.

28393,"Realmente, este jogo já foi melhor. Eu comprei ele ainda no começo do ano, e nunca tive problema nenhum pra jogar. Mas agora, não tem como jogar nada. Todos os servidores estão quebrados, e quando digo isso, estou falando dos tamanhos problemas de conexão que há. Qualquer servidor, mesmo os brasileiros com baixa latência, vai dar lag e você vai cair do servidor do mesmo jeito que acontece se você entrar num servidor russo, por exemplo. Todos eles estão assim, quebrados, com problemas de conexão, e o que falar da hitreg e hitbox do jogo? o espaço de tiro dos personagens estão todos com problemas, o conto de dano recebido e dado também é problemático. Hoje em dia você
pode dar um tiro de awp no peito de alguém, e pode acontecer dele sair vivo, ou o contrário, de alguém te acertar no pé, e você morrer na hora. Já vi balas atravessarem os personagens e eles saírem sem dano, ou eles derramarem sangue, e saírem com 100 de hp. E a Valve nem aí pro jogo. O jogo é antigo, mas não é desculpa para não monitorá-lo e o deixar de lado. Quantas pessoas até hoje compram e jogam o jogo e se deparam com isso. Eu o comprei por que ele foi meu primeiro contato com jogos na infância, e só queria me divertir. Nem isso tem como. Valve, eu peço por favor, concerte logo tudo isso, Senão eu vou é pedir reembolso mesmo. Não recomendo atualmente comprar este jogo."

28407,"They know me as the headshot machine. They know me from the highlight they see. They know me from the matches they watch. They talk about my one taps and they think for me aiming is so easy. I just go into a match and that's it. But my aim, it's comes from more than just a game. For me - aim - it is about precision... This part people don't see. This part, it does not show up in highlights. When I sit down to play everything already is a part of me"
28408,"This game is one of the most interesting, fun, and wild game i have ever played, apart from half-life source. this is one of my favorite games. if you like this game, you might be interested in trying out Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, it takes all of the ideas from this game, but puts it in a better, more fluent engine!

28428,"Oh god. Almost 17 years of my life wasted on this game. Don't buy, thumbs down, DON'T DO IT."
28429,"I remember the good ol’ days when us kids used to gather in the local library and play CS. 

This game changed a lot during the years. Seeing the source version improving both game physics, animations and textures. But the original is what started everything. I really miss those days when 20 kids took turns playing the game, due to the scarce amount of PCs our library had. 

Kids these days will never know how great this game was, and still is if you look hard enough for a server with awesome people to play with. I may only have 70+hrs in-game here. But I’ve spent thousands of hours on this game in reality. 

So if you want to reminisce the good times, buy it, if you like classic shooters, buy it. You won’t regret it.

Cheers, let’s hope this game stays around for a while more.

28463,"Counter-Strike: Es uno de los de primera generacion de valve, jugar online con amigos para distraerse, los graficos son regulares y la jugabilidad excelente aunque con muchos bugs, se pueden crear server con una variedad increible de Mods, skin, sound y models.

Es un First Person Shooter lanzado en 1999, como mod del half life, sin embargo cosechó un gran exitó y se lanzó como juego individual, siendo su versión 1.6 lanzada en 2003 por la plataforma Steam. Este juego tiene una gran popularidad, por sus mínimos requisitos que lo hacen accesible a todo el mundo, como por su elevada jugabilidad. Actualmente, es uno de los juegos online más jugados sin duda y más queridos. Lo que más destaca es su enorme accesibilidad y es fácil controlarlo, pero para jugar bien exige entrenamiento.

Modos de juego: 
+Multijugador 
+1 jugador vs Bots 

+Gran Jugabilidad 
+Adictivo y divertido 
+Gran comunidad 
+Accesible

No necesitas tener un ordenador potente para poder jugarlo.

-Malos gráficos (para aquella época excelentes) 
-Demasiados Bugs.

Sin embargo esto no es que sean puntos muy negativos por que esto aumenta su accesibilidad, dado que funciona en equipos muy modestos.

28470,"You are 14 years old, first time trying to play something multiplayer and online. You see this game, since you have a potatoe PC you start to play this game. Runs smoothly on 53 FPS, woow sounds are great, look an AK-47 but name CV-47 you play it you shoot, you get killed asking yourself how you didn't kill him cause you shot 27 bullets on that guy and he still is alive. You play it over and over, finally getting your first kill. (cause the enemy was coruching and looking the other way and you instantly kill him running 17 bullets spent) you get high hopes, I can play this game it is so easy. You get more kills, you get greedy you rush alone you get killed when you even thought about rushing by an AWP on mid. Ages pass, poeple pass, kills get comon. You start to play better, after 2 years you learn the recoils you learn the hidding spots, you know what is the enemy's next move. You practise your awp then. You play DM and DM only with an awp, your kills are slick, and your flicks are quick and accurate. Admin invites you to his clan. FIrst time you play this game with somenone for serious. You can't do anything cause you are not used to an opposite player to play smartly and you get owned, you don't do kills and your teammates question your skill. Couple more months pass you learn your duties as a teammate. You give info you cover you open. Clan gets closed down, you find another clan you are one of the best players. You play more switch clans for better ones. You get to LANs you get scared of the all expecations and so many eyes on you. You tilt and miss your shots, months pass, you get better, you become a man of steel and high nervous, 2000 hours pass you are finally a great player. 10 000 hours pass, you win LANs you play against better players, you try a gainst payed players you are toe-to-toe with them but you loose cause your team isn't on that level and they get scared. 20 000 hours pass game is dying and so is your love for this game. But no one can pay thoose voice chats from 8 P.M till 6 A.M every weekend with your friends. So much hours in this game and you acomplished nothing. You play against your local teams you get banned cause they don't expect somene to play that good without cheats and you stop playing this cause cheaters take over, very 12 year old first downloads a cheat then this game. You get mentally tortured cause the kid is telling you how bad you are and that you suck, you cry inside. Thinking what happened to me, how come this kid plays better then me, then you figure out the cheats are great, but you still play it fairly. You cry cause no one cares for e-sports in your country and no one wants to pay you for playing games. Your parents tell you you don't have a life you loose some friends, you loose your girlfriend you stop being active in sports. YOu just play this game hoping to be recognised, but you don't so to help everyone in this world after 30 000 hours on this game, don't play it it is a sinking ship and it is pulling you down. Tears are in my eyes for all the time I was good but now you can't play a normal match since cheaters will destory you... run READER, move away, press back and never turn back on this game.."

28489,"The best FPS game of all time hands down ! I have been playing this game from the early betas right from the begining ! (I still remember to this day, the character's legs weren't moving, it was on cs_siege) This was back in late 1999 or early 2000, now its allmost 2017 and I am still playing ! That is 17 years. This game has stood the test of time. Modern games are spurring like mushrooms with advanced graphics and whatnot, but none of them can give you the experience that this game can give you. I can sincerely say that there are a total of 2 maybe 3 games in all gaming history that can match this game's gaming experience. All in all I recommend this game to any new players who may come across it, who are looking for an amazing online multiplayer experience, and also a big shoutout for the old-school player as myself, don't stop playing this gem ! I sincerelly fear that it will take a very long time until a masterpiece of a game like this will appear, maybe even never. But who knows ? Untill then start cs 1.6 gl and hf ! :)"

28563,"The AWP is, even in CS:GO, considered one of the most powerful weapons in Counter-Strike history, and is easily the most used. Prior to Counter-Strike 1.1, shooting any single body part of an enemy with the AWP was an instant kill. The idea was that the time it took to reload the AWP would offset its power, but this was not the case.

1.1 made leg shots non-lethal. 1.5 made it take longer to switch to the AWP and made hip-fire extremely inaccurate. 1.6 drastically increased scope-in time. And it still isn’t nerfed enough."

This game in my opinion is more fun than csgo. Its a perfect shoter with lots of skills you can learn. The only way it's not perfect is if you hate 'bad' graphics.

28574,"I played CSGO before I played this wonderful game. I have left the CSGO scene and have been absent from any counter strike at all. But some of my new friends have talked me into playing with them and given the game generously to me. My first impression was ""It seems clunky and its hard to adapt."" But it actually after about 2 games quickly became a smooth and very exciting and well paced game. Going to old cache was absolutely amazing. I loved the classic look of the game. I feel much more inclined to get back into CSGO and any Counter Strike game now because of playing. This by far was one of the most fun and exciting games I have played. Well done 69/69. <3 Booboo"

28594,"Let this be a message to valve but since they just won't or don't care, it is for people to read and having an favorite of mine exemplified. Their modern game in the series of counter-strike is global offensive what is a more successful product in terms of finances. It's a lot easier when your income generates at a steady rate by gullible consumers or underaged youngsters but that's all their current game is about frankly and competitive scene is making a good marketing baseline for promoting so. CS 1.6 or Source in that matter of fact is everything better than ""THAT"" making it increasingly more bland by next coming update which add the next layer of cosmetics or rather less useful update. The reply that would come from someone who has no problem with the idea would say you shouldn't buy into it. There is a problem however, when a company does a thing such as this it's their driving force behind their current product (mostly doing well in most cases) would have implications for builiding on this structure and not really caring about what it is about their game. Hard working months upon years can be spend just learning how the gold source engine works in 1.6 and learning from your friend who will guide you in a custom server as your mentor/teacher to pick up valuable information on how to handle the game. Above all which is likely my strongest point is because it is actually fun to play without having to care about stats plus the other issues. Having such a love for the half-life serie my heart sores. People made amazing mods, mods that came from HL1 that were made into whole separate games or ideological advancements is staggering. Does this matter to you valve? Perhaps that's what made your previous games great. - Screw valve"

28599,"this is one of the first games i played as a kid during mid 2000s. i sure had fun playing it initially, but this CS game style never really grew on me. eventually i moved on to shooters like cod1, cod2 and later on 4, and i enjoyed them much more primarily because they were faster paced and movement was much more fluid.
i can definitely understand how majority of people love this game, they enjoyed it as a kid and just kept playing. back in the day, it was extremely popular and probably the best multiplayer shooter out there. countless LANs were held, and it was beginning of esports era. however, if you take off your nostalgia glasses, you have to see that cs1.6 is today outdated in almost every single aspect. i can't really recommend this game to new players that never played it before. i'd suggest maybe to try css or csgo, which will be much more enjoyable than 1.6 for new players."

28695,"Never before has a multiplayer game blended all the elements of true competition and sweat-soaked-shirt anxiety as well a Counter-Strike (CS). You probably already know CS as one of the most popular modifications for Half-Life. It's been available for download for over a year, at least in beta form. But unless you've got a super fast Internet connection at your house, you may not have played it yet as the nearly 100 megabyte download may be daunting for those of you not fortunate enough to have a high-speed connection. Thankfully CS has turned into a full-blown retail game and, while the two versions of CS are identical, it certainly worth shelling out $10 for this stellar title...plus you get a few more multiplayer goodies in the retail package to boot.

Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.

There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.

CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.

It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this ""Conga Line"" style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.

Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.

As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the ""wait and watch"" feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.

Not surprisingly, the user interface is very Half-Life-esque. Gamers who have played Half-Life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the ""Update"" on the server page. First-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.

Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, it's hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.

So how long does the magic last? Well we've been playing this game for over a year now and we still can't get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! We're still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess we'll just have to get them next time!

In a nutshell, if you're looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfying--this game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. If you like to play shooters online, get this pack!"

28727,This game is the only reason I got steam.  The WON servers went down and we were forced to migrate - that's why I was a week late getting steam; ddint get it til I had to.  I've been on steam for 13 years and it's all because of this game.  I wish steam would have kept track of hours back then - I would have several thousand.

28733,"Yes the mod that spawned more sick days and Granny's funerals than any other.
The foundation stone of Valve's gaming Empire.
Some heretics may claim that it was the excellent Half-Life (the Dating Trials of a Head-Crab).
They are wrong and should be burned in the same pit as 'buy-script' users. (or forced to play endless rounds of fy_iceworld vs P0Dbot).

28769,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.

Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.

Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.



[The legendary FPS, till this day its still being played quite actively, ""old but gold"" is the only thing that applies here.
You either win by teaming up or you'll be clutching the rounds, the game that'll take some time to become good at and will never feel like you've wasted your time as you can always continue learning and becoming better.]"

28774,sooo gud
28775,"This Game is a First Person Shooter that came in the late 90s as a part of another Game Mod called Half Life. However it's popularity grew rapidly even surpassing Half Life itself. It later became a Franchise with many other titles sharing same name but with various updates over the years.

Players assume the role of either Terrorists or Counter Terrorists and fight each other through both Single Player Missions and Multiplayer. Multiplayer is more popular as it is still played to this day on various Globally available servers and a dedicated player base. The basic game modes vary from Bomb Defuse scenario to Hostage Rescue operation to VIP Assassination. However there are tons of Mods which includes Gun-game, Team-Death-Match  and so much more.

Players can choose from a range of 8 different models of  characters on both teams. There are a varieties of Weapons available to choose from which players needs to buy at the beginning of each round with the money they collected from previous round by killing their foes or completing mission objectives.

The Graphics is Old School which fits perfectly with this almost vintage Game. Gaming experience varies from player to player and its definitely not boring. I would recommend New Players to buy it and get the earliest Counter Striker experience."

Met bunch of amazing people, learned english more than what school has taught me, joined and left great community every now and then; this game has a huge impact on my life, from personality to the way I see the world (not exaggerating).

Some people claimed they have slept with my family, some claimed they are not a hacker (while their crosshair moves furiously, claiming it was an earthquake), some other claimed they can play better if their ping was lower and some other claimed they have tracked my IP and are on the way to kill me. What a super friendly community.

Best multiplayer fps game in the history of mankind, never gets me bored with tons of user-made mod, and one thing that this game never cease to amaze me is the fact that this game has a better hitbox than CS:GO (come at me CS:GO plebs)

29006,"Counter-Strike is an iconic first-person shooter which blew up game industry. An ordinary game mode of Half Life was created by a couple of people without any ambitions. But the game was a success, it gained great popularity and became even a cyber-sport discipline. What you can see here – is CS version 1.6, a new version of the good old game with new balance, standard game modes and new weapon.

“Counter-Strike was a surprise in gaming industry.  An ordinary game mode became one of the most successful shooters in the world right after its release in August 1999. 12 years have passed and it is still popular.”- Doug Lombardy (Valve PR manager) says. CS 1.6 is urged to make the game even more fascinating thanks to brilliant balance system, improved graphics, performance and other interesting innovations.

Counter-Strike is a team FPS shooter. Create your team, face other teams and fight them to gain respect. Try various championships and competitions which are held over the world even nowadays. Enjoy jolly cooperation, try interesting tactics to obtain advantages over the enemy. Be fast and have no mercy, this is Counter Strike."

29046,"Best FPS online game ever. Gameplay is so challenging and addictive that you just can't keep yourself from playing it. Hard game for a beginner because shooting requires a lot of skill but it is very enjoyable moment when you pop a headshot and kill a better player and maybe even win the round with that one. In most of the cases it's pure luck speaking but hey, who cares. At least you made a headshot and had a one round of glory!

Only downside is the server list, which is hijacked and showing fake servers. Use gametracker or other sites like that to see the real servers. Valve should do something to this but it's been going on for years so I guess it's not gonna happen in near future."

Ofc, its outdated mechanics are still there but if you play just for fun on DM servers or whatever, it's a nice game."

if you don't like unfair advantages don't buy this game, until the big vac wave will come.
and i'm not talking about 3000 cheaters banned, i talking about much more.
on the GLOBAL-ELITE rank, atleast 40% of the guys is cheating, and i'm not saying this because i ""losing"" to them, i don't mind losing if its for legit guys.

29434,Legendary.
29435,The classic is still the best
29436,This (mod) game is the reason I bought Half-Life. It had that certain formula that elicits all the right neurotransmitters to keep addicted and craving more.
29437,we didnt use to play with russians in this one
29438,Great game
29439,Playing since version 1.3. I think that version was released around 2003. More than 13 years playing and still not enough. Best FPS ever!
29440,While it shows I have 1.6 hours on record. I played this game from 1.0 onward. Put hundreds of hours into it before steam was even a platform. There is no more pure a shooter than this. It has stood the test of time and is the main reason I started playing games on PC. So many hours of de_rats and scoutzknivez that I wouldn't trade for the world.
29441,"Good game. Has less polygons than what I bought this for, though."
29442,"The best there is, was and wi'll be, just pure class."

29459,Sick game and I miss it a lot. mIRC's community with #findscrim and #calscrim. Dude that was hellish. The CS:GO community is not as this one was before. Now we're stuck with people using non-steam all the time and plenty of hackers...

29527,"What, there's no skins ?"
29528,"He jugado Counter-Strike desde hace años. Fue uno de los primeros First Person Shooters que tuve la oportunidad de jugar y a primera vista me pareció muy bueno para lo simple que era en todo aspecto y, por ese motivo es que no me arrepiento de haberlo jugado con gran dedicación en su momento.

Counter-Strike es un juego de disparos en primera persona creado por VALVe a través de una modificación al famoso título Half-Life, lanzado al público en el año 1999. Claramente no necesita muchos requisitos, así que lo único que debes hacer es tener las ganas de jugarlo.

En cuanto al apartado gráfico nos referimos, Counter-Strike se desarrolló entre los años 1999-2003, por lo que no podemos compararlo con juegos recientes en donde las gráficas aspiran a ser lo más realistas posibles. Para entonces aquellos aspectos visuales competían a ser los mejores, y hasta hoy en día es agradable a los miles de usuarios que siguen jugándolo a pesar de tener un poco de polvo. Aún así, la comunidad se ha encargado de ""embellecerlo"", ya sea creando MODs (Zombies, Captura la Bandera, etc.) como también apariencias para hacerlo más interesante y atractivo al público.

En el aspecto sonoro, podemos encontrar hasta ese entonces lo mejor y más realista en cuanto a explosiones y disparos que se podía encontrar. La calidad no es la más óptima si lo comparamos con la diversidad de sonidos realistas de las diferentes armas que hay en el juego, pero sin duda marcaron un hito entre los jugadores.

No hay historia definida, pues nació básicamente de Half-Life y, a pesar de ello, no guardan relación alguna más que el motor en el cual se basaron y los creadores además del apartado gráfico. Pero sí tiene 8 personajes distribuidos en dos bandos: Anti-Terroristas y Terroristas. Para el bando de los Policías tenemos el GIGN; el SAS; los SEAL TEAM 6 y el GSG 9. Mientras que para los Terroristas los Elite Crew; Los Arctic Avengers; los Guerrilla Warfare y los Phoenix Connexion. La historia específica de cada grupo ya es a interés del jugador.

Si bien el juego quiere representar lo realista de un duelo armado, con equipo militar y sonidos reales, para entonces lo hacía de maravillas y, hasta hoy en día mantiene una comunidad que sin duda alguna quiere mantener la emoción que surgió al jugar por primera vez este maravilloso título. Cabe destacar que este es el comienzo que dio paso a otros lanzamientos con el mismo nombre, por parte de VALVe, y a opinión subjetiva, cada uno superando al otro pero sin quitarle la escencia de Counter-Strike. <3

~2 years later
he keep playing that game, but he never know that the game that he was played was Pirate Edition.
The Community was Great untill someone asked him to create steam account, so he create it.
but he never know who is the man that tell him to create steam account. poor him, he still dont know how to use it and abandoned his steam account.

~Finally this Day
Joe can buy a copy of Counter Strike Game that was launching at 2000.

My steam account reactivated at 2013/2014

Thanks Valve, Sorry back in that time i was 8 and dont have credit card to buy this game.

29677,"The CS1.6 is the successor to Thiel's CS1.5, a denizen of this magazine's ""Recommended Components"" listing ever since Sam Tellig enthused over it in August 1994. (He also wrote about it in May '96, while Muse Kastanovich's November '95 review included a full set of measurements.) Like the '1.5, the '1.6 is a floorstanding two-way design with a sloped-back front baffle. That's where the resemblance ends, however, as every other aspect of the 2002 speaker's design is new.

Whereas the CS1.5's baffle was flat, with step-backs for the hefty grille, the '1.6's is elegantly sculpted with a CNC machine to optimize dispersion, the minimal grille fitting into a shallow depression and held with concealed magnets. With the grille removed, the most obvious visible feature is a long vertical slot beneath the woofer, surrounded by a machined flare. This slot acts as the reflex port, but its geometry is claimed to minimize wind noise and any modification of its tuning by the grille.

The 6.5"" woofer, designed and manufactured in-house, uses a 3"" voice-coil to drive the metal cone closer to its perimeter than usual. This is said to increase the stiffness of the cone, pushing the inevitable breakup modes much higher in frequency than with a conventional cone and voice-coil. The large coil allows the neodymium magnet to be housed completely within the voice-coil former, inherently shielding the magnet. The 1"" tweeter uses a metal dome and, like the woofer, features a short coil with a copper distortion-reducing ring, operating in a long gap. The tweeter dome is recessed slightly in a front plate with a short flare, which will increase its on-axis sensitivity to match the efficient woofer, at the expense of restricting the unit's dispersion in the top octave.

The crossover is, as is usual in Thiel's Coherent Source designs, a phase-optimal first-order type. This and the sloping back baffle allow the sounds from both drivers to arrive at the listener's ears at the same time. In a welcome departure from earlier Thiel speakers, the CS1.6's sturdy terminal posts are sited on the rear of its cabinet rather than the base.

Sound 
Setting up the CS1.6s involved finding positions for them that gave the optimum balance among four nonrelated aspects of sound quality. The speaker's bass region is intrinsically shelved-down. However, moving the speakers close to the sidewalls to give some boundary reinforcement of the low frequencies also emphasized some residual hardness in the low treble, and resulted in a balance that was too bright with the speakers facing straight ahead. Moving the speakers well away from the sidewalls gave a sound that was clean and clear, but with insufficient bass. Keeping the speakers where they had the most extended bass but toeing them in so that they faced the listening seat reduced the hardness, added some useful top-octave air, and gave a soundstage that was superbly detailed and stable. On the downside, the overall sound was still a little bright for my tastes and system.

Ultimately, I moved each speaker forward along the line joining its acoustic center to the listening position, noting how the drop in bass weight was balanced by a corresponding drop in low-treble hardness. This sounds more straightforward than it was because the CS1.6's overall sound changed more during the break-in process than I am used to. Thiel recommends 50 hours ""at moderately loud levels,"" but at the end of the month during which I used the Thiels for my everyday listening, I was still not sure that they'd reached equilibrium.

But what had begun as brightness had been transformed into superb resolution of detail. What had started out as a lightweight, not too well-defined low-frequency register ended up as a balance that worked well on such superb double-bass recordings as Edgar Meyer's new disc of concertos, by himself and Bottesini, with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra (Sony Classical SK 60956). Meyer's Concerto in D starts with some E-string grumbling and portamento slides, all rendered perfectly clearly on the CS1.6s, without any boom obscuring the instrument's pitch.

29687,"Counter-Strike. You can't spell the name of this game without tears in your eyes. Why? It's simple. Many years have been spent on this game, trying to learn the mechanics and making a lot of friends that I'm still talking to in present.

I've been playing this game since 2006. That was the time I got my 1st computer and it was one of the first games I installed on it. It's impossible to don't get too nostalgic about it. 

There are still a lot of community servers available, especially in East-Europe, because of the addons that add a lot of variety to the gameplay, even if the GoldSRC is known for its limitations.

If you want to have a taste of your own childhood, you can always try it. It has its special place in my heart, and most likely will still have after the game won't be played anymore."

29747,"I haven't written a review in a while but I'd like to do one for this game. Before CS:GO came out I played this game every now and then after school but I normally played Source. I started playing this game after I remember the difficulty and skill needed to handle the aiming in this game and honestly after all these years this game is still amazing, if you get the ""These graphics are shit"" mindset and focus on the gameplay it's amazing. It's fast-paced and some of the modded maps are insanely detailed. Amazing game with amazing replay value."

29768,"Counter-Strike: Es uno de los de primera generacion de valve, jugar online con amigos para distraerse, los graficos son regulares y la jugabilidad excelente aunque con muchos bugs, se pueden crear server con una variedad increible de Mods, skin, sound y models.

Es un First Person Shooter lanzado en 1999, como mod del half life, sin embargo cosechó un gran exitó y se lanzó como juego individual, siendo su versión 1.6 lanzada en 2003 por la plataforma Steam. Este juego tiene una gran popularidad, por sus mínimos requisitos que lo hacen accesible a todo el mundo, como por su elevada jugabilidad. Actualmente, es uno de los juegos online más jugados sin duda y más queridos. Lo que más destaca es su enorme accesibilidad y es fácil controlarlo, pero para jugar bien exige entrenamiento."

When I saw the The “Just 5 More Minutes” award category :: instant flashback & cold sweat.. 

Year; 2005, clock; around 7 pm. Tomorrow is school day and I'm at a local Internet Cafe playing with some friends :: [i]Counter Strike 1.6[/i] :: time flies, u know how, its CS. Cell phone rings; constantly. ""Yes, I'm coming home, just need to finish the match, 5 minutes top'. I'm losing .. big time. I skipped some calls later (big mistake) for the sake of the match. Long story short, I was late and there were consequences. Left in hurry after and didn't pay the net fee, not that day at least. Time; 1+ am, game-over."

29887,"One of the best online shooters ever. Very few shooters did what cs pulled off. Cs managed to cater to pretty much every player whether you played comp, pub or were a casual player like me, cs did it all. Comp players had one of the best games to compete in, pub players had a great 24-32 player experience, and casual players like me had as_crazytank and mod servers.

 Shout out to anyone who played on the daves custom funmaps server back in 04-05 :)
