1,Kinda okay very short and not the best that half life as to offer 6/10
2,"If you liked Half-Life 1, then you'll like this. Imagine a shorter version of Half-Life that takes the best parts of the game and keeps it to a 2 hour experience. It doesn't shake the boat anywhere and it does not tell a really enticing story but the gameplay is solid and the puzzles are good and actually require some thought. I recommend this game to anyone wanting a quick recap of goldsrc's Half-Life experience without having to sit through the long and dragging pace of the original."
3,barney my beloved
4,This game is REALLY short. I only bought this because of the half life story.
5,"I feel like this one is the shortest from the 3 Half-Life campaigns, but it's pretty nice."
6,One of the games ever
7,"Best fucking game in my entire Life, my dick grew 6 inches just by installing this"
8,"its a good expansion not the best one that goes to opposing force, it was a nice experience although lackluster in its gameplay and its short playtime. Would recommend this to any Half-Life fan but only if its on sale, kinda disappointed they did not add achievements to the base game and its expansions definitely would have added much more replay value and fun."
9,"Best HL expansion. Only cons are: 1. lack of good music (uses OP4 music) 2. short length of the game 3. HD pack on by default (although this doesn't really count because you can disable it).

OP4 fans can go you know where
#BarneyGangster"
10,"Blue shift is really short and doesn't add a whole lot to the original formula but if you've played through half life you've gotta play this one, just get it on sale."
11, λ
12,"No better or worse than HL 1 and Opposing Force. Short but the length was welcome.
"
13,"There's an addon in moddb that lets you turn the crowbar blue

10/10 best half life expamsion"
14,"Decent expansion to Half-Life, but falls short of Opposing Force."
15,short but sweet
16,blue hafl life
17,Calhoun Most Attractive
18,"After giving Half Life another go, i'd thought i'd check out its expansion, Blue Shift! BY GOD, IT SUCKED. While the gameplay was good and it was a great introduction to Barney Calhoun, it was literally a rehash of the first game. Easy to get lost, boring settings, and bland characters. Just skip this and go to Half Life 2. You won't miss jackshit."
19,A short but great campaign of Half-Life expansion.
20,The game is broken. my mouse freezes the whole time. i played half life 1 and found no issues but this game is giving me issues. unplayable
21,"great expansion, just makes me love the character of Barney Calhoun even more"
22,Short and kinda forgettable but it's more HL1.
23,"a little bit short, but just as good as hl1 and opposing force."
24,this game is shit1
25,Just got a new job hope nothing goes wrong
26,"It's pretty good the only problem i had with it was that it was really short it takes me about 2 hours to complete
but i honestly enjoyed it"
27,"This is a good game. i like it because it gives a different point of view to Half Life
"
28,"coming back to Half-Life be like

29,"Honestly, i kinda liked it more than Half Life (Mainly because i had a crosshair in this game lol)"
30,good
31,i left it on thats why i have so many hours
32,you play as the passport guy
33,"This game is just like the other two in the franchise (in terms of pros and cons), except this game has a smaller story. It's really cool how many character cameos happen in this game, which I think is a good detail. This shows Gearbox's care for making good expansions, instead of making simple cash grabs. If I had played Half-Life 2 first, I would probably have forgotten about playing these great games, so I'm glad I made the decision to play Opposing Force and Blue Shift beforehand."
34,"you get to laugh at this character that acts like the average guy named bobby (although his name is otis) who:

-touches an electric fence not knowing he will get electrocuted somehow
-asks you for a quarter so he can get some candy from a vending machine, MY BROTHER IN CHRIST IT'S THE APOCALYPSE AND YOU WANT CANDY
-talks about his mom ""gEtTiNg wOrRiEd wHeN i DOn'T maKe iT h0m3 ToNiGhT"" instead of, oh i don't know, focusing on staying alive so that doesn't happen!?!?!?

i haven't even finished this game, i don't even know if i'm close to that, so there is probably more stupid crap that he does. i get the feeling they just put him in the game for shits and giggles. conclusion: otis is probably the funniest character in the half-life series, and he makes this game a hilarious experience."
35,"''Hey, catch you later and I'll buy you a beer!''"
36,.
37,be prepped for fucked mouse in the beginning but still fun otherwise (remember the shotgun is better than the AR)
38,just do it
39,"While this expansion doesn't really do much in terms of new content, it succeeds in showing the Black Mesa incident from another perspective. Quality in level design was inconsistent, yet it hasn't aged too badly. The physics are wonky at high frame rates like in the other games and can deal a lot of damage at once or make certain parts of the game annoying, but they didn't make it unplayable. I also saw some visual glitches and had a curious moment where I got stuck on top of a headcrab, being able to free myself by killing it.
Just like Opposing Force's audio and unlike HL1, it has some major volume balance issues with its and it's overtly distorted. Loading screens made music tracks constantly stop, so I didn't get much in terms of soundtrack.

Something that annoyed me was that despite the fact this expansion is mostly centered around puzzles and not combat, it's constantly putting enemies in annoying places where they are almost impossible to see before you get attacked by them. While Half-Life also did this, it was better telegraphed and happened a lot less often."
40,very good story to fill in some of the gaps from half life 1. its a must play in my opinion.
41,"It's the weakest link in the Half-Life series. Nothing new is added like in Opposing Force. It overall feels like mediocre fan-made content. You should really only play this if you want to complete all of the official Half-Life content. If you're really just looking to play more Half-Life and have a good time, you're better off looking at actual fan content."
42,"Blue Shift is a short expansion for Half Life that offers the perspective of a Black Mesa Security Guard who must escape the facility.
While I would say that Blue Shift is not as good as Half Life or Opposing Force, Blue Shift offers new levels and a different story and perspective.

NOTE: I would recommend using the HD models for Blue Shift. Not only are the HD models made for Blue Shift, but due to the games lack of new weapons and limited arsenal they make the game feel different (That is if you didn't use the HD models for Half Life and Opposing Force. I don't usually use the HD models so they helped make this game more unique and also helps with graphical consistency."
43,
44,"this is a good half-life spin-off, but it is very short (you can finish it in 1 day). I advise you to buy it only if it is on sale."
45,"so barney , where is my beer you promised?"
46,About that beer i owe yah
47,"this is definitely my favourite of the half-life 1 games. playing as barney was not only cool but actually felt different than playing as gordon or sheppard. the main difference is that HEV charging stations didn't work so i relied on vest pick ups for armour which was refreshing, but also your tasks are a little more chill as you didn't have to fight any bosses or super op enemies. i also feel like this game feels less broken than base game hl1 and opposing force, prob cuz it's the newest. overall, it was short but enjoyable so i'd solid 8/10 recommend and will def replay it in the future."
48,You play as Barney 11/10
49,Second expansion of one of the greatest games of all time it it's short but sweet
50,good game
51,"barney calhoun....

purple dinosaur

CRAZY"
52,This is a good spin off of the original half life.  if you have 5 bucks laying around and you want a short half life game to play after beating the first one play this.
53,be a boring mall cop in a science mueseum
54,"The hour count is lying to me i have not played this for 50 hours i played it for like 0.5 then got bored and quit but it just keeps increasing for no reason.
I'll probably beat it soon and then i'll post an actual review and when i say actual review i mean i'll just spew random shit out of my mouth."
55,DOOOR STUCK DOOR STUCK
56,"Better than opposing force imo
there is a badly lit ladder in the early sewer section, that is my only issue"
57,"Half-Life: Blue Shift, released by Valve and developed by Gearbox in 2001 is the second to last of the original Half-Life quadrilogy before Half-Life 2.

In this expansion you play as Barney Calhoun, a Black Mesa security guard. Blue Shift takes you through unseen yet similar locations of Black Mesa, and a short trip to Xen. This expansion focuses mainly on fighting the military—a welcome break after fighting tons of aliens in Opposing Force—and escaping the Resonance Cascade all while rescuing scientists along the way. 

Blue Shift is set in the same location and time frame as that of Half-Life except you're on another side of the Black Mesa Research Facility. 

At the start, Barney rides the tram from Area 8 Topside Dormitories on the surface, into the underground sector of Black Mesa. When you arrive at your destination, Area 3 Security Facilities, you find yourself locked out. After some time you are let in and this is where the game truly begins. After entering Area 3 you quickly put on your work uniform and are handed your service weapon. Shortly after this the Resonance Cascade takes place and it all goes to hell.

As Barney you see the disaster from a different perspective. Since you are not at all involved in the disastrous experiment done in the Anomalous Materials sector you see and hear the disaster unfold around you. Barney will slowly but surely gain insight as to what happened through conversation with scientists and by witnessing the military exterminate Black Mesa employees. Upon reaching the climax of Blue Shift I was pleasantly surprised by how exciting the ending was, I was not all let down by how it ended.

Now, while this Expansion has a less interesting arsenal than that of Opposing Force this didn't hinder it in any sort of way in my opinion. Gameplay remains the same, there aren't any new mechanics introduced, and there aren't any new enemy types. While this may sound like a letdown, I promise you it isn't. If you're looking for content similar to that of HL1 this expansion mimics that. This is primarily why I enjoyed this expansion more than Opposing Force which some may find strange. Its short length keeps Blue Shift from becoming too repetitive and boring due to the lack of enemy types and small arsenal. 

Everything considered, I believe this expansion to be a worthy part of Half-Life, and completely worth your time.

[h1] Score: 9/10 [/h1]"
58,"Short and Sweet, worth the price for another walk through black mesa"
59,If u have finished the first game i see this as a good place to get more out of it
60,
61,I played this in 2022 as part of a blind half life marathon and it was an awesome addition to the half life 1 story.
62,A pretty good expension and a story of a security guard.
63,"Decent experience overall with some serious issues. The combat was pretty great and tougher than the main game which was entertaining. Navigation was pretty awful, realising you've accidentally backtracked because of the weird layout can be pretty upsetting. Main issue for me was incredibly weak platforming puzzles which barely worked at the best of times, made classic Xen look amazing by comparison.

Worth a go if it's cheap but don't expect anything near the main games quality, feels closer to a mod than an official add-on."
64,don' t use hd models
65,"This game is a masterpiece. I teared up when Calhoun broke the silence by saying his iconic one-liner: ""Time to shift the blue"". That is when it clicked for me. This is the game I'd be playing for years to come."
66,barney simulator 2001
67,"An okay expansion to the original Half-Life, a lot worse(why can't I blow up the explosives with explosives, this doesn't make any sense!) in many ways but still a fun trip to go through. I'd recommend getting this one on sale though. Its really short and honestly quite easy."
68,goated
69,✔
70,Calhoun. Barney Calhoun. Calhoun Calhoun Calhoun. Calhoun.
71,"It tells the story of a minor character wrapped up in the chaos of HalfLife, and I can respect that.  Shows what everyone else was going through."
72,"People seem to forget that not everything can be GREAT. Blue Shift definitely is not as good as original campaign and Opposing Force expansion and I'll go as far to say that its not even for everyone, but I definitely recommend it to players who LOVED HL and OP, if they really enjoyed those, I think they are going to at least 'like' this one. Let me clarify, Blue Shift is definitely not 'bad', I would say its actually a good expansion, but it pales in comparison to Opposing Force, which, in my opinion, is in a lot of aspects even better than the original! Also I think people would understand Blue Shift a lot more if they have known its origins. It was supposed to be a bonus campaign for HL's Dreamcast port, but because that was cancelled they decided to release it for PC."
73,Big forehead scientist.
74,half life 1 but its blue
75,"A solid little Half-Life Expansion.
Keep in mind all the weapons/enemies are from the original Half-Life and it's pretty short, it was originally made as a bonus for the unreleased Dreamcast Port, still at the cheap prices on Steam, a little extra Half-Life that's professional quality isn't bad."

84,"Barney Baboon game very short, me very hard, me want beer.
"
85,"7/10

Really cool dlc that gains a rank boost due to it mirroring the vanilla story. Short and sweat with only some pitfalls when you go to xen."
86,"To be honest, I review this game makes Opposing Force an upper hand than Blue Shift. Blue Shift was the second game expansion for Half Life 1 and this expansion didn't add anything new like Opposing Force except the best Xen maps. The only thing I appreciate this game to exist is to let Barney Calhoun to have a backstory of how he survived Black Mesa to be in Half life 2."
87,"ABOUT THAT BEER I OWED YA
"
88,half life but blue
89,"The steam version is a glitchy mess. Also, there's no new content or anything. Just play opposing force, it's better in every way"
90,Short but if you enjoyed the other half life games and want some extra backstory for the sequel then this is an easy win
91,it's not good. Just play opposing force
92,"It's short and the design is a bit worse than the main Half-Life games, but it's still a fun experience that can keep you occupied for a few afternoons."

better xen missions than og game and some nice enviromentel puzzles. just wish it was longer."

104,Very gooooood

106,"The Half-Life teams works wonders in games. I've been dying to play Half-Life Blue Shift and now finally finishing the game. I was once amazed just like when I first played the first Half-Life. On too Half-Life  Opposing Force and then hopefully more Half-Life games.

110,If you liked Half-life I guess play this if you're really bored lol
111,42wef
112,"A fairly short expansion, but still greatly enjoyable. I felt OF was too much for me, and I enjoyed the lack of innovation this expansion brought, since I already loved the original game."
113,среднячок
114,"This is a really great Half-Life spin-off, showing the Black Mesa incident again, but on Barney's point of view. The game is generally really enjoyable, and I consider it definitely better than HL:Opposing Force.

I should probably note that I cheesed in some parts of the game by doing bhop or launching myself in the air with bombs because I couldn't find a way to solve some problems (or most likely couldn't find the solution because I'm dumb)"
115,Its alright. Somehow still buggy after 21 years. Slightly underwhelming compared to opposing force but still a fun dlc nontheless.
116,Nice and short spin-off of the first game that only took a few hours to finish. It was fun to see parts of the main game happening while doing something else. It was obviously the same as the main game in terms of gameplay that just told the same story from a different perspective. 
117,Benry👍

It isnt the best but if you want a quick half life experience this will serve as a nice dopamine hit"
124,"a short and simple game that can be finished within an hour or two at most, while I'd say it's not as good as Opposing Force in terms of difficulty. It's still a very entertaining game to play after finishing Half-Life."
125,Its short but i like it
126,old but still gold!
127,barney from black mesa just a week away
128,barney
129,"more of a formula that works;
fleshing out the resonance cascade with an alternate perspective"
130,Its like half life 1 but a little worse and more beautiful and it has HD models eww... just disable those the rest is good not as good as opposing force but i reccomend it when it is on sale
131,"One of my favourite half-life game
"
132,"A good game, other than a few difficult challenges, and the game being very short, I would recommend to all who enjoy Half-Life, or any other single player game."
133,Playing as the only competent Black Mesa security guard.
134,... I fucking love this game.
135,about that 31k in drug money i owed ya
136,A video glitch prevented me from playing.

151,it's good it's fun time
152,It is a short but a beautiful expansion pack for Half-Life
153,legalzinho
154,Barney's the single greatest half life character to ever grace the earth and none can change my mind.
155,if you have played hl 1 and 2 or are fresh off of half life 1 this game is worth it for sure.all problems for hl1 are the same here but that is what you get when playing an old game.
156,It is almost as good as Half-Life 2: Lost Coast (The best Half-Life game)
157,"honestly, very underrated."
158,"this is a nice quick hl game i sugest playing this first to eassssssssss your self in the the mecanics
"
159,Holy shit im that beer Guy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
160,"A fun yet forgettable experience.

Half-life: Blue Shift takes 1-2 hours to beat and is the shortest of the three games that are available on steam.

Due to the decrease in length the game isn't as jam packed as Half-Life or it's for expansion Opposing Force. 

Blue Shift features less weapons than the original game and no new weapons for this game or from Opposing Force; All the weapons featured in this game are basic guns so you wont be using the Gluon gun or the TAU-Canon. 

There's also no memorable moments such as launching a rocket, being left behind by your HECU comrades, fighting a giant fetus, fighting a giant ballsack and you get it by now.

Another problem coming from this game is the lack of new enemies, either original or returning from Opposing Force; Released two years after the first expansion you would expect a longer more expanded game that fleshes out the Half-Life universe in terms of characters, locations and enemies but this game delivers on none of that since this games main supporting character Dr.Rosenberg was featured one year earlier in the PS2 expansion Half-Life: Decay.

Ultimately this game is disappointing after playing Half-Life and Opposing Force, but at the end of the day it's more Half-Life."
161,"Half Life Blue Shift is the second main expansion to Half Life. This part of the HL1 saga puts you in the shoes of Barney Calhoun, everyone's favorite Black Mesa security guard who plays a more prominent role as one of the loveable characters of Half Life 2 in that game. But this expansion is a bit of a step down compared to Opposing force. It's still a very solid expansion, but worse nontheless. The role of a security guard is a less interesting perspective than the previous two, and there aren't really any new weapons or enemies introduced. Towards the end of the campaign you also visit Xen, but it's a lot more bearable than in the first game because it removes a lot of the annoying platforming. Despite some of the obvious similarities, it maintains the amazing worldbuilding, atmosphere, puzzles, and music that you can expect in a Half Life game. So if you're a fan of classic goldsource Half Life games then this should provide a short and sweet little taste of that for you, that I can easily reccommend to FPS fans."
162,Cool little Half-Life DLC that's practically over in a flash. You can do a lot worse for the asking price!
163,half life blue shit
164,"Well designed but not enough new, 3 hours"
165,"Guys, in today's video we will be hunting BLUE STEVE from minecraft, and if you hit that like button and subscribe, we might just be able to fight him!!!! So guys, if you want to try and hunt minecraft BLUE STEVE, you need to go to google and look up ""blue color code"", then you need to put that into the seed of the world. Then, you need to name the world ""MINECRAFT 666 BLUE"" to CONFIRM the summoning process of BLUE STEVE."
166,better than op4
167,"Compared to the other half life games, this one is really crap. It is a very unpolished game even when you compare it to the original Half-Life or Opossing force. The puzzles are just annoying and unfun to solve. The ending was also extremely anti-climactic: you just [spoiler] escape the facility, no boss battle, no chase sequence, nothing. [/spoiler] It's a drag to get trough, very disapointing.

Valve, what happened with this game?"
168,like opposing force but worsew
169,for some reason better than opp force imo
170,"Despite being the known weaker link of all the xpacs for Half-Life 1, it's a literal no frills, fast paced campaign that doesn't take more than an afternoon to finish. Small details complement the existing lore for Half-Life and even with the low amount of puzzles and weaponry and pretty much no new assets, it still is a great chapter into more Half-Life."
171,A fun additional game to play in the half life universe. It is not the longest game but has good gameplay and adds to the story of Barney Calhoun during the Black Mesa incident.
172,it's alright
173,"Nice little Half-Life expansion with thoughtful level design, near designs, and (usually) clever puzzles. Blue Shift's age is blatantly obvious to the modern player, but it is a must-play for any fans of old FPS games. Good job, Gearbox."
174,it was okay
175,killed more guards and scientists than aliens
176,"Classic, fun, short,"
177,Another Half-Life story from the perspective of a security guard.
178,Good expansion.
179,Finaly Now I can Play Half-Life 2 +_+

I love playing as Barney, one of many Black Mesa Security Guards. While OF is the canonical ending to the Black Mesa experience, I feel like Blue Shift offers the real farewell to Black Mesa before the events of Half-Life 2."
190,It's playable I guess?
191,i am writing this right after i beat this game a solid 8 out of 10 a good add on to half life it is easy and short and is the most disliked out of the trio of half life game i was never stumped on what to do like the others just a strait forward fun half life game
192,half-life: blue shit
193,"Not as good as either the original Half-Life or Opposing Force, but still a good bit of fun."
194,Paul Blart: Mall Cop 3
195,"I enjoyed this expansion more than Opposing force, and even the original.

It's short, and that's not a con. A game doesn't have to be a stretched out to 7 hours just to be a good one.

Although some might say that the story is boring, as you are just being sent around the facility by scientists, because you're expendable. I'd say it doesn't matter as the gameplay is fun. I loved the oldblack mesa, and this game contains my favourite half life texture! (yes, I have one) The liquid coolant!

The only issue a lot of people had that was aboit the in-game stuff was that one puzzle with the barrel and dynamite. It seems that some poeple just didn't go to elementary school and don't know that metal is conductive"

still very good"

Blue Shift is an alright expansion to Half Life. Its short but enjoyable enough. It dosent add any new weapons or enemies so its not as good as opposing force."
202,a nice side game. the only reason I played it is because I bought the bundle.
203,"[h1] I did not play 55 hours of Blue Shift [/h1]

"
204,its good
205,"its ok i guess









i liked it"
206,Not as highly regarded as other half life games or opposing force but its still a damn good expansion
207,The guard at the reception owes me a beer.
208,hate it the gameplay is terrible and the story is short
209,good
210,This game was probably easy but i still played it on god mode just in case.
211,They weren't lying
212,"Adds more background to the original Half Life, but did not draw me in so much to make me complete it. I more so enjoyed the Half Life 2 games - these original expansions are mainly for people really keen for more story and content."
213,"My favourite Half Life expansion, no final bossfight, but I'd even rather play this than the original Half-Life and/or Opposing Force."
214,"It's a neat little game, I personally prefer every other half life game, but it's got its place I suppose."
215,Barney was simping dr rosenberg
216,this game slaps bro
217,I LOVE HALF LIFE BLUE SHIFT
218,"A good game that's not without its frustrating moments. There's plenty of run and gun action interspersed with puzzles. Some of the puzzles though, feel more ""I, Spy"" than brain teasers. The level, ""Power Struggle"" almost can't be beat in two different areas unless you are super observant or you just happen to guess correctly--I say guess because the mechanics of the game aren't established so clearly in the beginning enough for a player to figure some moments out. 

SPOILER: one puzzle involving the use of a metal barrel to complete a circuit for a dynamite comes to mind--the gray metal barrel is surrounded by wooden crates so it's difficult to spot to begin with. 

Secondly, the dynamite on the metal door does not explode even if you shoot it with APC's, which is a problem because this logic puzzle relies on you understanding the game more than real logic. There's only one way to solve the puzzle, which is not intuitive because it's difficult to understand that the barrel could be used for anything. Another issue from an earlier level--a ladder is hidden behind a shadowy wall, and it was so difficult to find. 

Yet some other puzzles require creative arrangements of crates and barrels. It would've been fun had not the barrel arrangement require absolute precision on the player's part. Hours are spent fine-tuning barrel placements to get things to work.

Other than that, it was a fun diversion--short gameplay that felt long due to the repetitive nature of looking for these ""I, Spy"" elements. It is fun learning more about the teleportation device the scientists at Black Mesa created. I would've loved to see an earlier cameo of Gordon Freeman. The music, while simple and only one track, is pretty cool. I really thought I was going to encounter Gordon hacking at some zombies with his crowbar. Oh well."

221,very good barney is best character
222,epic
223,tell dr breen i said fuck you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
224,"Great game, best classic half life because there are only like 4 alien controllers"
225,"A must-play if you're a fan of the Half-Life franchise. It is much shorter than the original Half-Life, but very enjoyable."
226,"I Would not recommend this, because, i try to go to the place where i need to go, the elevators will not work sometimes.  and there are bullsquids and other aliens that are in just unexpected areas. and i died about 34 times while the 3 hours i've played this. and i just wouldn't recommend this, you should go play the original instead. And, either way, in Blue-Shift, the ""Easy"" difficulty (the easiest difficulty). is still freaking hard. so i recommend the normal Half-Life."
227,good game
228,My shift was blue
229,yes
230,"it's good, just I prefer Opp For."
231,"played it for a few minutes, pretty good"
232,"Hey, Catch Me Later i'll Buy You A Beer!"
233,"its fun to play at first, but wouldnt be doing a walkthrough again, opposing force is better"
234,"Say ""Chumtoad"" without the H."
235,"Half-Life but you play as B. Calhoun, a security officer in Black Mesa. Compared to Half-Life and Half-Life opposition force this game is quite shorter and much more easier mainly due to how much resources you can get after getting into a battle, unlike the Half-Life and Opposition Forces which were quite unforgiving with their resources. More than 3/4th's of my fight in HL and HL:OF forced me to fight with less than 10 hp left, while in HL:BS I almost always had 100 hp and even a bit of armor when getting into fight, hell I only ever died in my playthrough due to the environment such as falling to my death, never died during combat. So if you like Half-Life but want the campaign to be shorter and be easier then this game is right up your alley."
236,"Its like half life but you play as the guard guy you pass at the beginning of the game 
"
237,👍
238,Gaben is picketina Lana Rhoades
239,"This game is arguably better than Half-Life, as is Opposing Force, but in this spinoff you can really see the improvement and ingenuity that was happening after the gold engine was becoming more familiar and easy to use for the developers. This is a fantastic game and aged very well."
240,"It's not that I wouldn't recommend the game, but Steam reviews don't give you many rating options. I just don't think it deserves the same rating as the original or Opposing Force given the horrible amount of bugs and rather bland gameplay.

This game has about 3 hours of gameplay. It took both me and my boyfriend 3 and half hours to finish it, and if we both didn't get stuck searching for a ladder in the underground, I think it would be almost exactly 3 hours.

I experienced this really annoying bug where every time I reloaded the game, the guy started shooting. No matter what save it was, if I reloaded it myself or I died. There were like ten different places I got stuck – jumping or crouching didn't help, and I had to reload the game.

Gameplay-wise, I really struggled at the beginning because of the lack of ammo. There was a segment where I had to rush a corridor full of aliens because I simply didn't have any ammo. But once you met the soldiers, you earned a ton of it and the game became super easy.

Story wise, I enjoyed the beginning because I really like seeing one situation from different angles. But then it got kinda boring. Let's just say I expected a bit more, because it looked very promising at first. There was a point where the scientist said ""you gotta retrieve a power cell"", and I thought ""this feels like there will be another chapter, but I doubt they would make a chapter based on retrieving a power cell"", and then the title ""Power Struggle'' appears. So yeah, the story is so-so.

Oh and I hated the part in the already mentioned Power Struggle where you have to connect a cut detonator by a barrel. I thought about it but then didn't say it out loud because I thought my bf would think I am an idiot for even thinking that it could work. Well that's exactly what you are supposed to do and it just doesn't make much sense to me."

242,fun
243,its okay

249,Half life blue shit is the worst game ever because it is recruiting disabled children to Elon musk’s door and raiding him
250,"as for blue shift being a 2 hour long campaign i don't think it's that bad honestly, well some people may criticize it for how short it is, but to be fair it's not all that bad, just a sweet and simple half-life game. in this one you play as Barney Calhoun, a security guard working at black mesa up until shit hits the fan just like in HL1, soon after Calhoun attempts to escape black mesa but not without the help of Dr. Rosenberg and some scientists of his who built a transporter to teleport themselves outside the facility. if you're looking to kill 2 hours of your time, give blue shift a whirl"

257,"Somewhat of a short but quite enjoyable and well paced expansion, less action oriented than Opposing Force and instead a bit more focused on puzzles.

268,"I am a 40 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
269,"👍 I don't want to write a review for this game, but I do want to give this game a thumbs up to help the games ratings because I enjoyed my experience with it 👍

Ignore my time, I left my computer running a lot with the game still open. The game took me about 5 hours to beat.

Fun game! Very short, but that's ok, was a nice expansion of the original half life game. Though that tnt puzzle is very obscure for us now these days. Look for help online if you can't figure it out, I sure as heck couldn't, lol."

278,Nice.
279,"great
"
280,so good i had so much fun!! ;)
281,"If you're unsure on whether or not to get the full version of GoldSrc HL1, Blue Shift is a good way to test the waters on the way GoldSrc games play without having to commit to the full HL1 experience. And for those who have already played HL1; either the GoldSrc original, the Source-engine remake or its community HD re-imagining Black Mesa, it is a nice bit of supplementary story material to help bridge the gap between HL1 and HL2 with a minor twist on the gameplay mechanics related to HL1's armor system, albeit without the full arsenal of weaponry and equipment upgrades you get from the full HL1 experience."

285,i also like
286,"Like the game, this review is short and simple. This game is overall just okay. I don't really have much of a stance on it. i mean it's a DLC following Barney Calhoun and his short journey to help the scientists and himself escape Black Mesa. It happens during Gordon's journey in the first game and makes it clear where you are in relation to Gordon. It's short and doesn't have much story wise. It's main purpose is to answer your question of ""what were the scientists and security guards I met along the way doing during all this?"" And it does well at explaining that. All the same criticisms I had for HL1 apply here except for difficulty and pacing. Thats why i give it a 6/10."
287,"For its age, it's a pretty good game. You'll get more insight from different perspectives, I hope Valve makes more Half-Life games like this. Seeing the same thing, but from an angle and perspective.
It took me about 3h for me to finish, even though it says 85 minutes (I played the game in offline mode at first)"
288,eh its fine i enjoyed it but not as much as opposing force
289,bery goood

296,some pcs bug on this
297,"Unlike opposing force, which is absoluteley amazing, this expansion left me extremeley disappointed. There arent really any new weapons or enemies, only slight variations. The story does offer a different point of view to the black mesa incident but one that is much more boring than the other ones, extremely bland. A waste of time and money, I recommend skipping it."

301,"A nice little HL1 expansion pack, this one deepens the lore rather than expands gameplay."
302,"""Good morning and welcome to the Black Mesa Transit System""

Half-Life Blue Shift was released in 2001, 2 years after Opposing Force and was too be the last of the expansion packs within the original Half-Life saga.

Blue shift represents the security division of the Black Mesa Research Facility, albeit, you are now in the eyes of the infamous ""Barney Calhoun"" a name synonymous within the HL community as a major character to the on-going series. This will undoubtedly tell the back story of Barney and his involvement during the catastrophe of Black Mesa. Thus will give you an understanding of his role to come, his relationship with Freeman and his adaptation going fourth into Half Life 2.

Blue-Shift very much so entwines itself into two other stories without any excessive elaboration. That of paths of Gordon Freeman (being the original Half-Life) and Adrian Sheppard (being Opposing Force). Many areas, perhaps actions and words will resonate as the story progresses and give you a ""fly on the wall perspective"" and interpretation of the events that unfolded for different persons within the Facility during the cataclysm.

Blue-Shift is a reasonably quick game and you are given a slimmer but similar inventory of HL weapons used by Freeman as opposed to Sheppard, who deviates in this area due to his mission statement and employment. Blue-Shift does not diverge from its conservative HL roots compared to the original, levels are similar but different, puzzles need to be completed to advance, scripted scenes without cut-scenes and the continual use of chapters.

Blue-Shift also came with an extra addition called the high definition pack, which comprised of better textures and models. I do applaud the devs in the early days, how Blue-Shift represents and perceives Black Mesa as more ""lively and livable"" with people going about their day, as opposed to the standpoint of other HL games. Furthermore as authentic as the half-life experience is being alone most of the time, Blue-Shift also incorporates more team work and interaction with scientists to achieve objectives.

However the game did come with mixed reviews, critical of the games length, no new enemies or weapons, compared to the other expansion Opposing Force. This did extend to the depth of the high definition pack and by extension of the games characters. I believe its rated poorly compared to the others.

Those reviews aside and as a long time gamer and Half-Life veteran myself I do believe they are are quite minor and it is nothing to compare to the likes of some modern games being released today.

The blue Half-Life as its called, is a nostalgic addition which takes many of us older gamers on a trip down memory lane. A  must play IMO as it does give perspective of a different protagonist and does wrap up their path until the events of HL2!

I believe a remake for Blue-Shift is still in the works (hopefully comparable to Black mesa remake!) so watch this space.

319,"Half-Life: Blue Shift is an expansion pack for the FPS video game Half-Life. It takes the same place and time as in Half-Life and during its events, but now, instead of playing as Gordon Freeman, you are playing as a control security guard Barney Calhoun. After the incident in Black Mesa and all the ongoing mishaps, you with the help of Dr. Rosenberg, a high-ranking scientist try to evacuate the facility.

The expansion pack consists of a Training Room and 3 modes: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
The Training Room is exactly like the one in Half-Life, the only exception is the holographic Barney replacing Gina.

1. Easy mode: The easiest thing you will ever play. Difficulty: 0/10;
2. Medium mode: Still easy, barely even a challenge, not even close to breaking a sweat. Difficulty: 1.5/10;
3. Hard mode: Finally something challenging, but not even close to the hard mode in Half-Life. Difficulty: 3.5/10.

Weapons: The same weapons in Half-Life, but the variety of weapons is reduced by half.

Multiplayer: This expansion pack has no multiplayer.

Overall it's a decent expansion pack. Worth to have it, especially if you like to indulge in the Half-Life universe."
320,"Wow. I was so eager to play this expansion but it ended up a false advertisement. The description says ""Play as a guy that helped out Freeman on different occasions!"" and yet we never interact with Freeman.

I hoped to be in some of the situations with Gordon or to see how they connect all random security guards with each other but...no.

Also, I expected Barney to have some kind of voice. All the guards have it, so why Barney is an exception? Moreover, NPCs talk to Barney as if he's saying something to them! Now that's stupid.

All in all, this is trash. Leftover, bland, uninteresting false advertisement. Boring. Beat and forgotten"
321,eh pretty good some of the combat encounters are dumb but not bad.
322,"Half life but shorter, less weapons, godawful hd models, and it isnt worth your money."

325,"Play as Barney Calhoun, the mild mannered security guard of black mesa, as you duck and dodge your way out of Black Mesa and the Xen, through all adversity, with the determined valor of getting Doctor Freeman that beer you owe him.
"
326,hayyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
327,"end!, its kinda time machine..bring back my childhood :)"
328,"I love barney i really do but he left his friend gordon get killed by the military because he doesn't have any money on his wallet to give the beer he owes him which is very bad behavior. This could ruin they're friendship but luckily in the sequel gordon survives the incident and barney has come to an understanding to gordon that without money there is no beer and they're friendship is reunited once again.

10/10 game heartfelt touching story and decent level design i guess"
329,i bought that beer

332,My buddy Steve had a job like this.
333,"I recommend playing Half Life first before this since Half Life: Blue Shift is more of a standalone DLC that further supports the story of Half Life as you assume the position as one of the security guards at the Black Mesa Research Facility. If you have played Half Life then expect the same experience with some more interactable puzzles and shootouts. The overall experience is short and sweet so that it does not overstay its welcome.

Minor spoilers detailing the actions the Player (Barney Calhoun) takes on his journey:
[spoiler] I would only say there is a minor discrepancy in the description for this game and what actually transpires in it. It claims that Calhoun has helped Gordon out of ""so many sticky situations"" but as the Player I felt like I have missed something. During my playthrough I felt like I only spied on Gordon during recognizable moments that happened in the Main Game rather than help him. Although I did appreciate how they managed to tie it all in to really make you feel like you are progressing alongside Gordon and to see how far he has gotten in his story compared to Calhoun's story. Perhaps the in-store description is referring to past events between Gordon and Calhoun which would explain Gordon's innate skills with firearms as he could of had training from his old friend Calhoun. [/spoiler]"
334,"Half-Life Blue Shift lives in the shadows of Opposing Force and the original game, but it is still fun. There are a lot of problems, and the game is very short, but in many ways this is exactly what the game's target audience wants: more Half-Life. Know the problems, but otherwise this is worth its price (at least if it's on sale).

PROS:
- All the great weapons and enemies from Half-Life
- Great level design with an actually fun Xen level
- Expectedly great performance
- Has more frequent and engaging ""Valve"" puzzles (could be a con to some)

CONS:
- Uninspired and boring storyline when compared to the original and Opposing Force
- Extremely short, taking little more than 2 hours to complete on a first time playthrough
- Introduces HD models that feel out of place, though they can be disabled
- Build is more unstable than the original game with somewhat frequent crashes"
335,"Half-Life was brilliant. It revolutionized the first person shooter, provided hours of entertainment, introduced us to a world of weapons and bizarre creatures, and most importantly- it stayed with its plot throughout the game."
336,Barely functional first major puzzle
337,"First problem. it's short. Like your first playthrough is over in maybe two hours short. And half of that time is spent figuring out the buggy aspects of it. If you do buy it, a great timesaver to know... F6 to quicksave, and F7 to quick load, you'll need it. Also, if you jump onto a ladder, you wont grab it if still holding space. That wasted over half an hour for me.

Now, the game itself isn't... bad... but it's not great or anything, again, it's got some issues and sticky moments in the gameplay or logic puzzles that are kind of jumps from what it set up before then. So there is frustrating moments. The basics of the story and experience is kind of interesting... but honestly there's just so little story or stuff here it's barely worth playing for extra half life lore (the reason I got it). So, not bad... but not good, and super insanely short to the point that even five dollars I payed feels like too much for this bite size bit of a game. Many demos have more content than this entire game did."
338,"i bought this expecting to be able to buy gordon a beer and i was severely dissapointed
good job randy you fucked up even when you had no chances to"
339,barney is a dinosaur

Taking the role of Barney Calhoun, a security guard from Black Mesa who like Gordon, starts his day at work as usual, until the infamous Resonance Cascade occurred causing him to fight his way through Xen creatures, along with fighting marines. Once again, there story is very very similar to Half-Life & Half-Life: Opposing Force, but unlike those two this game is much shorter than usual. The game also appears to be much easier during my play through. For all 3 games I played on Hard Difficulty & noticed this was the easier of the 3. Game play remains the same as the other 2, graphics & sound are starting to feel out dated mainly because this came out in 2001, while Half-Life was released in 1998, & Opposing force in 1999.

-----------------------------

I never quite got the vibe from HL2 Barney that he'd been to Xen before. Maybe he was always just too focused on the Resistance movement at hand to play catch-up, maybe it's a consequence of the fact that Valve didn't really have the expansions in mind when making HL2. Either way, for one reason or another I always perceived a certain comparative mundanity in HL2 Barney. That is to say, I always thought he was just some dude who happened to fight his way out of Black Mesa competently enough to escape, whereas Gordon Freeman has his legendary reputation for making the HECU and border world his b-words. But to my surprise, Calhoun is sent by Rosenberg into Xen for a quick teleport rerouter patch. 

Black Mesa had been sending employees to Xen to scout it out and milk it for all it was worth already (the environmental storytelling of base HL1 covered this) but it still strikes me as odd to find out that low level hallway guard Barney, who probably didn't get glimpses of the scientists' experiments a lot and ""still [has] nightmares about that cat"", had to go inter-dimensional and fight a few Controllers just to meet continuity status quo. I dunno. Maybe the Combine gave Calhoun plenty reason to forget about his escape from the incident. Maybe having experienced a fluctuating teleport himself is the real reason he got so concerned during Gordon's. Or maybe this is all just me caring too much about overthinking the narrative of a video game series and its relation to externally developed supplementary material.

Oh, right, this was a video game, I should review that part. It's alright. If you just want a little more Half-Life 1, this sure is about 3 hours' worth of it. I'm looking forward to seeing HECU Collective's remake of it pan out; I find Black Mesa Source and all things related to it have delivered splendidly on the promise they showed so far--stuff's been worth the weight, so to speak."
361,otis
362,Better Call houn
363,Its another Half Life Story. Don't need to say more. Just have fun and enjoy.
364,"Maybe it is because I am older, maybe because I am more picky, maybe it is because I want more of a story, maybe it is the old graphics, maybe it is the janky controls. At this point, the appeal of the original Half Life games to me seems to be mostly nostalgia and the attractiveness of the premise rather than the actual game. I enjoyed all the Half Life games as they progressively came out over the decades. Trying to go back to the original Half Life after seeing the upgrades in Half Life: Alyx showcases how far games have come since the early 2000s. Too bad the team who did Black Mesa did not also remake Blue Shift and Opposing Force to allow modern game-preferring audiences these games."
365,guard commits genocide
366,"half life: blue shift is the 3rd half life game ( laugh emoji )
it's nothing unique, same as the 2 other half life games only there are less weapons, enemies, levels and variety
i finished this game in less than 4 hours and i managed to stumble upon - a pistol, a rifle, a shotgun, a rpg and 2 types of grenades.
even half life 2 had more weapons!!!
there is no final boss battle like the previous games, the game just ends.... 
the level design and story are terrible and messy.
the biggest problem this game has is it's age. the game relies heavily on map items & objectives so since the textures are so old you have no idea what to do. if the textures were newer i would've completed this game in 2 hours.
the only good thing going for this game is that at certain times the lack of weapons and resources is quite interesting - you're not gordon freeman, you don't have an HEV suit so obviously you can't refill your armor with HEV stations, you only have access to a limited arsenal of weapons which are realistic weapons and not crazy alien shit - health, armor and ammo are quite rare, but noone plays half life for realism or semi survival elements
if valve or some valve fanboy remakes the HL1 expansions, they better sell them in one package or it will be a scam.

371,"this game was super dark and overall frustrating to play. even though it was short, about half my playtime was because of 2 ""puzzles"" that had stupidly cryptic solutions and one point where I thought the game had been softlocked because some elevator didn't work. It didn't work because there was a dead headcrab in the way (off to the right, clipping under the lift, barely visible). I might've seen this and fixed it in 15 seconds instead of 20 minutes if the game wasn't so FUCKING DARK and I could SEE. play half-life 1 or opposing force, this is not worth your money"

384,It's nothing special but it's not nothing either.
385,A pretty boring addition to the series that adds very little.
386,"Half Life Blue Shift, I actually finished this today, which means, I finished the whole singleplayer expansions and Half Life 1 in General. To be honest, Blue Shift was enjoyable enough.

387,"short spin off about original half life
its has good puzzles,level design, secrets and etc but its short and nothing unique.

It’s shorter than all the other games and STILL DOESNT HAVE THE COOL ROBOT GUY!!!!!!!! WHY MAKE A PLAYABLE COOL ROBOT GUY BUT HAVE HIM NEVER APPEAR!!!! There is 1 cool part in the beginning of the game where you see grodon in the air train when you’re trying to open the door which is also in half life 1 you see benrey open the door so +1 point. 2/10 Good game
401,Play if you love puzzles that are super hard
402,It's a different point of view of the Black Mesa incident and I love the different times you encounter freeman through out the side story.
403,"Much like Half-Life: Opposing Force, this expansion pack is set during the events of Half-Life 1. This time you're playing as a security guard named Barney Calhoun who, like Gordon Freeman, happens to be a witness to the Resonance Cascade, and much like Gordon, Barney must fight his way through the HECU Marines and the Xen aliens.

Not much new toys are given to you, and the only real gameplay change I could think of was that you can't use HEV charging stations, but its still very fun. Guns are still great, and enemies are still fun to fight. As always, when the music plays, its great. It is a rather short game though, so I recommend getting it on sale."

424,"Out of the two Gearbox expansions to the original Half-Life, this one is my favorite.  You are Barney Calhoun, a security guard just working your shift waiting for that beer a certain scientist owes you then all Xen breaks loose.

437,"A lot of people rat on Blue Shift, but I actually really like it. So much so that I might even say I like it more than base Half-Life 1. Compared to HL1, Blue Shift is easier and more simple, and there is a lot less wandering around and being confused by the janky puzzles. Unlike HL1, the zen section is actually a lot of fun, albeit short like the rest of the game. It is a short campaign, it only took me about 3.5 hours to beat my first time, but the whole experience was a lot of fun. The story of Blue-Shift parallels its gameplay, being more simple than HL1 but still fun and consistent. Overall I like Half-Life: Blue Shift and I definitely recommend buying it."

457,"The Half-Life franchise is actually a lot simpler than others because it has 2 games and some DLC. However, I'd say the Gearbox expansion packs are less regarded as part of the core Half-Life experience because they aren't really that important in the story. Despite this, I'd say Gearbox did a damn good job with these games. Blue Shift is very cool because it offers you a different perspective of Black Mesa from security guard Barney's eyes. You get to see the security offices and explore around different areas than you would as Gordon. There are some cute ties to Half-Life too. The gameplay is largely the same but without the HEV suit. You can't charge your vest using the HEV chargers but they are still around for some reason. I guess it adds cohesion. The overall story is pretty short but fun. There are some cool puzzles and interactions. The levels are designed pretty well. The combat encounters are fun. Overall what you'd expect from a Half-Life game."

467,"[h1]Review of Half-Life: Blue Shift[/h1] 
The second official expansion to the original Half-Life, developed by Gearbox Software, putting you in the shoes of Barney Calhoun. A Black Mesa security guard, who's ready for another long & uneventful day on the job. I'm certain nothing at all would happen here at the Black Mesa Research Facility that could cause some kind of catastrophic emergency... Right? 

Originally a Sega Dreamcast exclusive chapter, was turned into a standalone PC experience after that console's short lifespan came to an end prior to Blue Shift's release. 

[i]I highly recommend you read my previous review first, on Half-Life, for greater context to my discussion.[/i]

[h1]Security Shift[/h1]
While Blue Shift was released after Opposing Force, like it & the original game, the events of the story canonically play out alongside each other. So there's no harm in playing this one before Opposing Force or even Half-Life. The references to said game, can be experienced both as someone jumping from this one to that one, or vice versa. Personally, I choose to play Blue Shift immediately after the original Half-Life. Due to its smaller content amount and shorter length in comparison.

It's quite enjoyable to be running parallel to the events of Half-Life. While still utilizing the same methods of story telling & world building. In-fact, you'll start your journey on a tram ride not unlike Gordon does. It's also quite interesting for it to be themed after the Black Mesa security branch. Instead of an HEV suit & its power, you rely on body armor. Instead of the classic orange HUD, you have a stylish and superior blue HUD (Don't @ me). Simultaneously giving us a different perspective of the Resonance Cascade event. It's exciting, not knowing when it's going to occur, but knowing it's coming. Then watching just how much chaos was unleashed across the facility first hand. There are multiple direct references to Half-Life, such as seeing Gordon more than once, Half-Life: Decay, at the time an upcoming PlayStation 2 exclusive co-op chapter, and Half-Life: Opposing Force, the first expansion. More importantly, as far as narrative is concerned, you'll learn just a tad more about what Black Mesa was up to that lead to the events of the original game. 

Barney Calhoun, an important character to the franchise's story, isn't just sitting around waiting for the whole thing to blow over. Like everyone, your main goal is the get the Hell out. Running through entirely new areas of Black Mesa, visiting the border world of Xen once more, and hopefully escaping with your skin still attached. However, the pacing of Blue Shift is quite a bit.. off, feeling. Of course, you cannot parallel one to one as each player's experience is going to be slightly different per game. Here though, events that you'd expect to come later in the original game, occur almost immediately in the story here, or after roughly an hour of play (Including an important Gordon scene). This isn't a complaint mind you, and I'm sure there's some sort of explanation to be given, just something I noticed. 

In regards to the pacing, if you were hoping for another Opposing Force style expansion, you're unfortunately going to be disappointed. The narrative additions and handful of new areas, are really the only 'new' content you can expect in Blue Shift. You'll not fight any new Xen creatures, or HECU, nor will you acquire any weapons/gadgets unique to this expansion. On the contrary, there's actually way less than the original game here. Only a handful of core weapons will be at your disposal. Not bad, but a let down if you were hoping for more like Opposing Force gave. I'd say overall, Blue Shift is mainly just about introducing Barney Calhoun, and how his journey leads to the next installment. With that being said, if feels as though areas are a bit more detailed than the Half-Life.
|
The length of an entire playthrough is also drastically shorter than the original game + Opposing Force. Coming in at a staggeringly low 1-2 hours. Leaning more towards the 2~ hour range for a first playthrough, perhaps. You can practically blink, and the game is over. As an add-on to your Half-Life experience, that's just an extra bit of playtime, but if you're treating this as it can be treated, a standalone experience, you may be underwhelmed. On top of that, the difficulty is far lower than previous titles. Ammunition also never really becoming an issue like it can in Half-Life. 

Across my short playthrough, I experienced a handful of bugs that did not occur in the original game (For me, at least). None of these were game breaking, but could be slightly annoying depending on your level of tolerance. The most common one I was experiencing was when dying from gibs, I would reload firing my gun continuously until I clicked to cancel out the firing. Even if I wasn't shooting upon death. Another I experienced was this strange... almost rubber banding effect where my mouse would snap around and I'd seemingly teleport a few feet. I was able to fix this issue with an online thread post. During the Xen portion, I managed to get stuck in mid air, but was able to free myself. 

[u]HD Pack[/u]
Released with Blue Shift was a high definition upgrade pack that covered the original game and its two expansions. It focused up upgrading weapon models, a handful of props/interactive objects, as well as some NPC's & creatures. The actual reception of this pack seems to be hit or miss among fans. I didn't mention it in my review of Half-Life, but you have the option to manually turn the HD pack on or off (It's on by default). I tend to keep it off, with the exception of Blue Shift, as it was released with it. 

Some of the new models look great in my opinion, while others completely rework the visuals of weapons, and can feel a bit out of place with the rest of the game's visuals. Weapons like the shotgun look great with the upgrade, but changing the classic Glock-17 to a Baretta isn't to my liking. I'm indifferent on the MP5 submachine change.

Unfortunately, no changes were made to the game's flashlight, as it doesn't mess with the engine's lighting mechanics. The flashlight being a bit of a difficult tool to use in the original game as well. 

[h1]Conclusion (Pros & Cons)[/h1] 
The best way I can describe Blue Shift is a bonus spurt of original Half-Life story, that sets up a character for the events that'll follow in the sequels. It is a downgrade in regards to playable content though, so take that as you will. 

[b]Pros:[/b]
+More story context
+Barney Calhoun's introduction
+Atmospheric storytelling
+Blue HUD

[b]Neutral:[/b]
~Insanely short (1-2 hours)
~Handful of none-game breaking bugs
~Vacant OST(?)
~HD Pack

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Large drop in difficulty

Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Please remember, that this is just my opinion. We don't have to agree, one thing I love you may hate, and one thing I hate you may love. Hopefully this gave you an idea of what to expect.

468,Short but sweet. If you love Half-life this is a must play.
469,"Its A Fun and Engaging experience Thru the Perspective of the Security Gaurd at the Beginning of Half-Life you see as Gordon Freeman on the Tram. The Game is Thrilling and Scary. As Creatures from another World Start pouring in the Black Mesa Facility, You must Fight to survive the madness and Destruction. I Would Highly Recommend This Game to Players who want something fun and enjoyable. Half-Life is one of the Greatest Games EVER MADE!!! <3<3<3 Buy The Half-life Pack that Comes With All the Games and save your self some Cash $$$ You wont Be Disappointed :D"
470,"Very nice expansion for Half Life, i recommend you to try it. I would say that Half Life 1 and Opposing Force are better, but that does not mean that this game is bad at all. This is the first Half Life game i completed and if you are fan of the series, give it a try."
471,"nice
"
472,This game sucks ass and is way too easy. Its full of low level enemies and long boring ass hallways.
473,glitches you cant complete the game because the chanber/teleporter wont start
474,"You must be very yung if you haven't play Half Life ever. But I don't want to spoil it to you so Imma say you buy this and enjoy it cause it can't be otherwise, a truly masterpiece definitely recommend it."
475,its kinda short but it was good!
476,"Half-Life is probably one of my favourite games so it might seem surprising i waited 20 years to play Blue Shift

guess i didn't want to be disappointed, luckily my fears were unfounded, this expansion fits in perfectly with the original game & while abit short the quality isn't lacking, if you love the original Half-Life you will enjoy Blue Shift"
477,Its alright its the worst half-life game but its alright
478,"𝙃 λ 𝙇 𝙁 - 𝙇 𝙄 𝙁 𝙀 :  𝘽 𝙇 𝙐 𝙀  𝙎 𝙃 𝙄 𝙁 𝙏

I'll say it and I'll keep saying it, Half-Life: Blue Shift is underrated. There, I said it.
I've heard people say that it's boring, it doesnt add anything to the story, no new weapons, characters, etc. But they're looking at it the wrong way. This was going to be released as a Dreamcast game, but later published on PC. Take on the role as B. (Barney) Calhoun, a security guard at Black Mesa, who is one of Gordon Freeman's allies. Survive and successfully escape out of the facility with Dr. Rosenburg. Fight off military, and kill how many Xen creatures you can encounter.


PROS:
Good combat, gameplay feels nice and smooth, good story to keep you playing, feels like an expansion pack to the original Half-Life (don't expect it to be similar to OpFor,) not too easy nor not too hard (in my opinion,) and most importantly, play as everyone's favorite security guard (except for Otis).

CONS:
A little too short, Blue Shift uses the same soundtrack as OpFor (surprised Gearbox didn't care to compose new music,) and there's less weapons than Half-Life 1 itself.


This is still a game any Half-Life fan should play at least once.

𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗯𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝗜 𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗮!"
479,"A well made, simple game with amazing gameplay"
480,"After playing a little bit of Half-Life Blue Shift, i'll say it's sorta of a decent game. Even though It's not good as Opposing Force. But is still a decent game. You're playing as a typical male figure ""Barney Calhuoun."" He's a Sec guard working for Black Mesa, til a bunch of aliens and zombies start roaming the place. Barney has to escape Black Mesa. Even though Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force are better than Blue shift. I still recommend it to Half-Life enjoyers."
481,:)
482,Jim
483,Not as fun as Opposing force but it is good.
484,Can't find myself as interested playing HL1. Still a good game tho.
485,Good Half-Life expansion
486,"gud game. Can buy ,not bad, no wait, buy now, no Money? no problem, only little money spent, can buy, thanks for reading."
487,This is a good old game.
488,They literally made an expansion pack of the first guy you see in Half-Life.
489,"Had a lot of fun playing it, it is the halflife 1 time but from another perspection."
490,Blue half-life
491,"short and sharp but a great nonetheless
"
492,"I'm shooting straight, Blue Shift was always the bad one.
People give it crap for being boring and short.
I can understand where they come from.
I like this game. I love the Half Life universe, I like how it doesn't take center stage, but rather supports and connects the already established storylines. It's not reinventing the wheel, but that means it's quintessentially true to the original game. Play Blue Shift, you get Half Life. And I think that's decent. And in a way it tweaks the formula, carefully, but there are changes. I for once do appreciate the increase in story and voice acting. That specially aged fairly well, the pick up armor, ocerall the lower level of equipment is also very considerate and it are details like these that make me enjoy Half Life story telling so much where everything makes sense, way more than in other series. The levels are good, in addition to the quality plot and worldbuilding, the puzzles are good, the gameplay is good, it's all just very on par. And being on par with Half Life should mean something.

Blue Shift, you're alright."
493,too many headcrabs
494,good game play now or me fuck mom ok????????
495,small but cool i give it an 8/10 beacuse it is like extra levels of half life 1 but its small
496,"This game expands upon Half-Life's story, having you play as a Black Mesa security guard. Overall, it's more Half-Life, which is always a good thing, but it does get a bit boring in some parts. However, the game's short, so it doesn't overstay its welcome. It's worth a playthrough if you love Half-Life and want to get a bit more out of the franchise. You also get to learn how the teleporting works which is a fun little bit of lore."
497,"even though it is very short only like 3 hours it is still very fun to play, and is well worth its small price"
498,oh shoot the game didn't close
499,remove the last F from the title
500,A short but fun addition to the half-life universe
501,"It's such a mid game compared to the original HL or Opposing Force[spoiler]...which is better than this[/spoiler]. The only enjoyment you can gain from this is being nostalgic to a nostalgic game. It just doesn't work.
Maybe I'll turn around to this game one day, but for now I can only think ill."
502,It's pretty good.
503,You play as chad barney.
504,its a short game but an enjoyable one. would recommend you play it whenever you have some free time cause the game can be beaten in like an hour and a half
505,"It's worth playing if you liked Opposing Force, but not that fun."
506,We did it Calhoun! We made it!
507,Very fun short little half life game
508,Have not played it as for I accidentally opened it and forgot to close it for multiple days
509,It's a really good game.
510,Really Cool
511,my half life dlc of preference
512,"6/10

516,Classic from the past!
517,pew pew
518,"""Aye, me bottle o' scrumpy!"""
519,"i like this
"
520,fine.
521,"Awesome expansion pack, its shorter than any other Half-Life game but the map layouts, level design, crisp narrative and thrilling pace make up for the length of the game. 

Also, play this to truly understand why you owe Gordon a beer."
522,"This is basically just more of what Half-Life offers. Not as good, but still worth playing if you enjoy the original."
523,"i havent played this game, i tried streaming it form other computer, and i can  turn it  off!!!11\ help"
524,"This game had its hard moments but the ending felt very sudden, and I had to go through several walkthroughs to discover that I had found the correct ending.  It wasn't very satisfying, and it left me feeling like I had missed something.  All in all, this one was less enjoyable for me in particular.  Still, it wasn't a complete waste of time, as I got a little extra original Half-Life time.  3/10."
525,"Half Life: Blue Shift has nothing outstanding about it, but it still manages to be a good time. Back when it was first released, this game was criticized for being ""more of the same"", but ""the same"" is still a good videogame. Sure, Blue Shift is short and buggy, but it shows some interesting sights unseen in the base game. Any Half Life fan that wants a little more should check this out."
526,its.... half life but... ehhh??
527,"Kinda the middle child of the original games, Opposing Force was the more popular pick and for good reason. Being as short as it is it's not a bad game at all. It's mostly fun there is just not much new content they added."
528,"Most satisfying ending of the half life series. Everything about this expansion is done great: puzzles , cooperation  and shooting :)"
529,good
530,Barno
531,it is very good and fun
532,9/10. Could be a little longer.
533,"step 1: Play Half-Life Opposing Force
step 2: give up
step 3: play Blue Shift instead"
534,blue half life
535,"Amazing experience! Played it all the way through in hard mode and it was difficult of course, but still, a great experience c:"
536,"This is the second, and the shortest expansion of the original Half Life game. Here you play as Barney Calhoun, one of the security guards at the Black Mesa Facility, and you help the scientist survive the invasion of the Marines and the Black Ops, while Gordon is trying to fight against the alien threat as seen in the original game. You will play through all the behind the scenes of the security guard’s journey and all he does while Gordon is away. 

Technically, this expansion is very similar to the original Half Life: You will find no new weapons, enemies or music. The gameplay itself is very similar too, of course without certain Gordon-specific mechanics and weapons. Graphically it does come with a high-resolution textures pack, and a very similar look and feel to the original game. 

So, this is quite a different take on an expansion when compared to Opposing Force, which has not only much more content and play time, but also a completely different feeling and atmosphere that made that expansion had an identity of its own. Although not as rich and complete as that first expansion, this one is still very interesting and worth playing, especially taking in consideration its reduced duration.

Even though this release is not completely canon, and you can certainly skip it and still understand the main storyline of the saga, I think that is quite an interesting and very fun short release that makes the player understand the importance of Barney for the next games. Going through the facility from his point of view does highlight a totally different perspective and makes you realize that Gordon was not the only one with an important role of saving Black Mesa. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who played and enjoyed the original Half Life."
537,"Blue Shift more like blue shit am I right gamers hahahahahahhahahahhahhahahahahaahgahaagkahkfahkfhjgfshgkafgbfiabigy



Yeah it's just kinda okay, buy it on sale or in a bundle. It's acceptable but nowhere near the same level as the base game or Opposing Force."
538,ignore play time
539,"Its okay, not as interesting as HL1 or Opposing Force. Still a decent spin-off IMO"
540,"I wish I could give this a neutral rating, it isn't bad, but isn't good either, there's tons of bad level design, and considering this came after Opposing Force, it's a disappointment there aren't any new features or content, except maybe Otis.... and Dr. Rosenberg, either way, it's a very short campaign, I found myself finishing it after 3 hours, and I was just lazing around looking for easter eggs, I suggest you buy it during a discount."

It's an old game, and it doesn't look pretty by today's standards, but dammit if it still doesn't hold up and tell a good story from a fairly uninteresting character's POV (Barney)."
543,good
544,"security guard simulator, accurately depicts the average day on the job for a security guard is. every mall cop should be required to play this as part of their training. 

it's only a couple hours long but its a fun condensed half life experience if you have never played half life or want to replay the originals I recommend starting with blue shift before playing half life and then opposing force. this was originally supposed to be included with the dreamcast version of half life explaining the short length."
545, the happy chemicals i get from playing this game can't be beat
546,"3 hours of gameplay, its pretty alright

Should have been a movie imo"
547,didnt have to resort to brute-foce-save-scumming as much as the other two black mesa escapades
548,"Cool expansion, not as good as opposing force but still a must play for any half life fan.
You spend most of the game fighting low level enemies and don't fight the hecu until quite late which can admittedly get a little boring.
Not the best game on it's own and I'd choose opposing force over it any day but considering it was originally ment to just be a quick bit of extra content after you've beaten half life it's great to see such a narrative driven game. 
Go play it."
549,"Good game, i recommend it"
550,What it lacks in length it makes up for in girth
551,"Blue Shift is fine. It's not like op4 where it has a bunch of new toys to play with, it just kind of is. The new places you explore are really cool and even add to the story of half-life every now and then. My only real issue with it is Rosenberg. It's not a must play for half-life, but if you really like base half-life, go ahead. I only warn people that Dr. Rosenberg probably drank all of the glue in the facility before the disaster. His AI is somehow more of a struggle than any other npc in the goldsrc half-life games...

But if you want to deal with Dr. R, but don't want to play blue shift, there is always decay..."
552,"A single suburban father (Barney Calhoun) works at black mesa research facility as a security guard to make ends meet, and he takes his job very seriously, even though most of his colleagues and customers don't. As the resonance cascade approach, Barney gets his moment to shine when Gmans little helpers shut down the Black Mesa down and take hostages, including his Doctor Rosenberg and Kiliner . He realizes no one knows the place better than he does, and he mounts his trusty steed, a Segway, and goes to the rescue."
553,blue balls
554,BARNEY CALHOUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

556,A nice little expansion showing some unexplored parts of the Black Mesa that ties with the OG Half Life story.
557,Unga Bunga!
558,barney
559,"I think Blue Shift gets a lot of unnecessary hate. I like it. If you're looking for a fully fledged game, then I'd more recommend the actual Half-Life (or it's remake, Black Mesa), since this was more meant as a side-story then a full on game. However, if you're bored and have a few hours to kill, then I recommend playing this."

572,"While this is extremely dated, it still provided a reasonably fun time."
573,"Well after finishing this game, it was a good game you as the first barney not as his 10000000 clones. so uhhh yeah pretty good game! also but i really like this game instead of you being a marine. Well uh thats all for me, goodbye!"

575,play it
576,Very nice addition to Half-Life's campaign.
577,"This is a nice add-on for Half-life 1. If you enjoy the Half-life series, this is a must-play as it shows important pieces from the first game in a new light."
578,"Short, but fun"
579,Half-Life: Opposing Force but everyone owes ya a beer. (In my own opinion) this game is better then Opposing Force because you actually have a dynamic level setting other then walk down a corridor and fight aliens.
580,Im 90% percent sure that Surface Tension alone is longer then this entire game
581,Really short but still fun

584,"Kind of scared the **** out of me in some places but it was funny at the same time lol
Realy fun to play"
585,"-Beat it in 2.6 hours
-No new weapons
-No new mechanics

But it's Half-Life, so 7/10"
586,It's like half life 1 but without the annoying bits
587,Our favorite Black Mesa security guard (read unique Barney clone) goes on a adventure in order to escape Black Mesa.
588,"lemme preface, when i say i recommend the game, i exclusively mean to those who want more half-life 1 style content. this is a very skippable entry however.

let's start with the pros: it's an expansion of half-life 1, a game i found so enjoyable, so the mechanics being mostly the same definitely made me enjoy it more. plus, the continuity between this game and the base game are fun to see. unfortunately, i did have more negatives with this game than i did the original.

the game took me 3 hours to finish and probably could've taken less if i hadn't made myself dinner midway through the game, leaving it idle on my pc. it's so short that you dont really get the chance to appreciate anything until the credits roll. this doesnt make the game bad, per se, but compared to the 15 hours i took in base half life, it was extremely underwhelming

adding onto that aspect, the last couple chapters felt very much like a chore. [spoiler]xen felt better than in half-life 1, but the last 2 chapters where you're trying to get the charged battery just felt very tedious and not as fun as the rest of the game.[/spoiler] it kind of felt like padding, as if they needed to reach some sort of playtime quota. a short game, especially as an expansion pack, can still be really fun, but feeling the need to expand this by 2 whole chapters that really didn't need to exist just made the game feel so much more arduous to complete.

the weapons were also very lackluster. [spoiler]since you arent playing as gordon, but rather as ""b. calhoun"" who is a security guard, thus only really having access to a pistol for a good portion of the game. you do get the shotgun, smg, and some explosives later on, but the experimental and alien weapons were inaccessible (except for the snarks, which i never use). i know that's for lore and continuity purposes, but it was still upsetting to only have some pretty basic weaponry.[/spoiler]

overall, yes i do recommend it, as it was very fun, but i would not classify it as a must-play if you are trying to get into half-life. there isnt much lore present here that wasnt already known from the first game and as such, it's very skippable. if all you care about is seeing the events of the black mesa incident from the point of view of that security guard you see on your tram ride, then this serves exactly that purpose. 6/10"
589,👍
590,Very Good Like Half but without the HEV suits good story sometimes a few bug but most of the time there funny
591,"it's very blue and very shifty, would recommend"
592,realy good game it does not have originality but heres the thing op4 happens after gordon is put in to stasis by the g man so the race x aleins knew that gordon is gone so they invaded earth while but blue shift happens when gordon is not yet put in to stasis so the race x aleins knew that if they invade earth now they will meet the same faith as the xen aleins but I wish there were more weapons

613,"It's a Gearbox Gold Source Half-Life game. therefore, it's pretty good."
614,"I know I haven't played much but hear me out.
This game is pretty good, a nice addition to the Half-Life series, but it's probably my least favorite game in the franchise and here's 3 reasons why:

1. The HD models; They just don't look that good. But I do think they fit better into the context of Blue Shift than they do in Half-Life, which makes them slightly tolerable here. 

2, The story isn't that great. I haven't played for much longer and the story is really basic. It's just Half-Life 1 from Barnie's perspective, I know Half-Life: Opposing Force is just HL1 from a HECU soldier's perspective, but the thing that made that game so good was the new content, the new enemies, weapons, and environments just make it way better than this.

3. This game just feels like extra levels for the base game of Half-Life. I know Opposing Force is also ""technically"" just extra levels, the reasons I listed above show why Opposing Force is just a better game.

Now, just because there's some things I don't like about it, doesn't mean you shouldn't buy this game. Its a pretty good game if you've beaten Half-Life 1 and want something else to play. ]

Decently good game, 6/10 from me.

618,"Honestly, After so many years, I have to say that the game is very cool, but it has some significant bugs

1.The game is very short
2.No Multiplayer Mode (Very Pity) :(
3.No Exit to Main Menu Function, you only need to exit the game immediately

That's Everything I don't like, but mostly the game

 8,5/ 10"
619,"A fun, albeit short, expansion.  A unique perspective of the Black Mesa incident.  More puzzle-focused than Opposing Force, Blue Shift doesn't give you new enemies to fight or weapons to use.  Yet it is a fun few hours of gameplay."
620,I mean the og half life is better but I guess this is good
621,it fun
622,"It's Like A Capri Sun
It's Good But In Only A Few Seconds You're Done"
623,YOU PLAYED THE HERO. YOU PLAYED THE VILLAIN. THIS TIME. YOU'RE STUCK RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.
624,"How the hell did I manage to get 25 hours out of half life blue shit?
Lmao"
625,Barney
626,same as my half life reveiw
627,Barney simulator
628,its more half life but its not unbearable
629,imagine being a hl fan from the early 2000's circa and realizing you just wasted 40 bucks on a campaign that lasts for like 2 hours
630,"It's the weakest of the Half Life games, but it's ok."
631,"Im very torn on this game, the puzzles are better than the first one, the pacing is better, the environments are better, there is only ONE Xen level and its really short. But it still suffers from the first ones bad gunplay although it is much better in this game because there are much less bullet sponge enemies and usually when there are those types of enemies you actually have ammo. The biggest problem with the game however is the CONSTANT stuttering and freezing which is especially bad in the latter half of the game, I even crashed twice at the very end of the game. I think its much better than the first which I know is EXTREMELY controversial but I really appreciated the level design of this game which was even better than the first because a lot of the fluff is able to be cut out with smaller levels. Overall though, I think the constant freezing and crashing ruined the game for me, I could have seen myself replaying it but frankly I dont want to even try because like the first it happens way to often."
632,"compared to Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force, Blue Shift is pretty short. I don't know if that's because it was originally gonna be in the Dreamcast version of Half-Life before it got cancelled, Besides that, it's overall not a bad game. there's something so real about just being a security guard trying to make it out of the facility. Short but sweet"
633,Barney Calhoun rule 34
634,Really makes you feel like a security guard
635,great DLC from the great game itself
636,"Good but too short.

637,"The entire hud is blue but the crosshair is still orange

0/10 unplayable game"
638,"Whenever I started this game, I had some trouble with the camera movement, but I later figured out how to fix it. Even with that small problem in the beginning, this game was great for a short expansion. It does fully bring you more information about the Black Mesa incident, and I believe anyone who played the first game should get and play this game."
639,7/10 - Good
640,"nut ?
"
641,least favourite half life game but it has barney and barney and gman are the best characters mike shapiro good voice actor
642,NOT BAD MISTER CALHOUN :D I LOVE IT <3
643,no time for gamez calhoun
644,pretty fun
645,i played this longer than i should of
646,Playing this makes me appreciate how good the original Half-Life actually was.
647,Great little expansion from the POV of the blue shift security guard.
648,This is a good expansion but still not good as opposing force.
649,"Blue Shift was a good Side Story, but it feels like it missed something, but it's as good as Opposing Force."
650,"in the game's ending calhoun turns to the camera and says ""I served my shift. My Blue Shift."" credits roll"
651,.
652,nice
653,good
654,"Everywhere I go, I saw Barney BUT IM BARNEY TOO!!"
655,Half-Life blue shift absolutely fantastic game a little bit short but great
656,pretty short for blue shift but not bad
657,It's a Half life Blue Edition+
658,谢谢你，gearbox。童年神作好吧
659,"I'd say Blue Shift is probably the weakest of the three games set during the Black Mesa Incident. It's fun, but it's basically just more vanilla Half-Life. Not a bad thing by any means, But it doesn't really do anything new like Opposing Force did. I also experienced a few bugs. Nothing too awful, but I got stuck between objects more than once and had to reload save files. I'd say you could probably skip this one, but seeing as how people seem starved for Half-Life content, Blue Shift is there to give you a few more fun hours of chaos at the Black Mesa Research Facility."
660,"Mais curto que o Opposing Force, mas ainda assim, bom."
661,"It's pretty much Half-Life 1 but shorter, with less weapons and with less story. Decent game though."
662,"mid w
edit since steam wanted me to: still fckin mid"
663,There is not much too say. I like it and its fun to defeat the military
664,"Not my cup of tea, but a compelling story that expands on the Half-Life universe. Worth playing if you care about the series!"
665,BarNeys sHifT goNe wrOnG!!1
666,It was alright
667,gameing
668,"You play in the shoes of barney, and makes it understand it's lore and how he knows about what he knows, cool thing to know that he actually went to zen too. Also having a nice view of freeman getting captured at the end, giving the idea of how further the game goes after calhoun scapes."
669,i laughed for over half an hour at a dead security guard
670,Cant sex gordon. I thought he was a freeman
671,astronomy pun
672,decent
673,"Half-Life: Blue Shift excels at continuing the storyline built by the original Half-Life and Opposing Force. The game play is good and it builds suspense incredibly well (the enemies jumpscared me more times than I'm proud to admit). The puzzles are fun and creative as well. That being said Rosenberg is a lil bitch, I hated leading him around Black Mesa.

Also it glitched out Steam to make it think that I have had HLBS playing in the background for 95 hours. I swear I have a life; this game has some weird vendetta against me."
674,"Barney Calhoun is a COP

a FUCKING NARC

ACAB"
675,not made by valve so its weak
676,It is good game
677,"As with Opposing force it was fun to see yet another perspective of the Half Life game, this time Barneys perspective. Once again the events of this game tying in with the events of the first two games was really clever and interesting."
678,cool
679,this game made my bals shift blue
680,sex
681,"*sniffle* *sob* hic* brhrarmey cahlhoiun..l;,.,. *hic*..jeuhfugnbfj *sob* *sniff* ehubhfughueuhugh...."
682,"Kinda shit
tutorial is confusing and terrible
Couldn't beat it so I stopped"
683,"this game is like garry's mod i like it
"
684,hamiton
685,Though it's short it was still really fun watching the events of half life unfold from barneys perspective
686,Fun gameplay if you like HL. But 1) under 4 hrs on hard; 2) some annoying level design and story choices; 3) no new weapons or enemies; 4) Rosenberg voice and AI are so bad it's funny. Got it for $0.62 but otherwise skip it.
687,gg

689,"filler game, nothing new or exciting
the same bullshit as the main game
too much platforming and even more too much shooting
i can understand why the stupidly overpowered and over prepared military are after gordon, one dude and so is barney, but why are they after barney or just another guy to kill on the way
i HATE HATE HATE HATE ENDLESS ENEMIES, WORSE THAT COME OUT OF NO WHERE, IN LARGE NUMBERS, EAT AMMO FOR ALL THREE MEALS OF THE DAY, MEANING THEY ARE BULLET SPONGES AND BECAUSE ITS SO FUCKING ANNOYING, I CHEAT, YES IM A CHEATER CAUSE THESE GAMES ARE NOTHING BUT RUN AND GUN AND IT GETS VERY OLD AND TIRING TOO FAST.

SHITTY LEVEL AND PUZZLE DESIGNS
THE LEVEL DESIGNER OF THESE GAME IS A REAL ASSHOLE
TOO MANY ROOMS FEEL EXTREMELY UNREALISTIC, IMPRACTICAL, FAR FROM SAFE AND OSHA VIOLATION BREAKING. PUZZLES AND ROOMS THAT ARE BROKEN AND OR INCOMPLETE, THE ONLY WAY I COULD PROGRESS WAS BY CHEATING. HOW THE FUCK DO YOU SCREW UP A GAME THAT ONE NEEDS TO CHEAT TO MAKE PROGRESS AND BEAT IT. ITS BAD DESIGN AND OR A GAME IS TOO FUCKING HARD AND UNFAIR AND MANY DEAD ENDS

MANY GAMES USE THE SHIFT KEY TO RUN, THE GAME MAKES YOU GO SLOW
WHOS THE DUMBASS THAT THOUGH THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA?

AND YOU MOVE AROUND AS IF YOU'RE ON ICE. EPIC FAIL"
690,Fuck
691,pretty good
692,Haven't played this in years but about to start from scratch.  I remember really liking the game when I last played through.
693,barney is jaja funny man.
694,"this one just explains how some people escaped black mesa thats it. no new hostiles or guns barney has the smallest amount of weapons in any half-life game. its just a waste but if you want to buy it i cant stop you.

3/10"
695,barney the dinosaur
696,pretty neat but is worse than half life or opposing force. I only recemend playing it if you really enjoyed the hl1 gameplay or want to explore more of the lore.
697,good game
