0,"It's quite the interesting listen from Valve. 2005 was certainly different and while these ""technologies"" aren't nearly as impressive as the stuff we've seen today... it is very nice to see that these additions to the source engine can be seen across the board today."
1,"Cut content from the Highway 17 chapter in Half-Life 2 (Highway 17's development name was ""Coast"", hence the name ""Lost Coast""). Made to show off High Dynamic Range lighting, and served as a testbed for Valve's commentary system."
2,It is a fast paced version of the larger game that gets you used to how things work'
3,short AF
4,Managed to escape the feast of leeches by fading away into the void
5,"too short
(clueless as to the fact it was a demo)"
6,"This is not a game! This is a tech demo from 2003, which shows the capabilities of the new (for the time) features in the Source engine. This included HDR and the commentary nodes. This is an incredibly short demo and I recommend enabling commentary for your first run through. The environment looks great and the Valve team commentary on water reflections and HDR within Source was really interesting. I recommend this if you're interested in game documentation and how game developers create sections of games."
7,Cant wait for Half life 3
8,"It's good to read the reviews before playing. If you go into this expecting Half Life 2: Episode 3, you'll be disappointed.

However, if you expect a short tech demo with interesting dev commentary, you'll be pleased. That's what it is and it's done very well."
9,"Quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, it is also very very short."
10,It's a great demonstration of what the source engine can do. I really wish there was more content to the game.
11,Nice
12,the more half life the better
13,coast located i win
14,"A free inclusion to look at the development of Valves games, a great 20 min play on the cliffs."
15,"This was too easy and too short, i found the coast as soon as i started"
16,This is the most emotionally charged one of all the games in the Half-Life franchise. I cried when the funny old man did the funny. 10/10
17,fish
18,"Basically a tech demo that does not look now so impressive, but for 2005 it was :)
Small level, 20 mins of gameplay."
19,"This game is pretty, can't wait until it turns 18"
20,i found it
21,I broke it.

25,"I bought the Orange Box before it was free back in 2009 or 2010. I was maybe 9 or 10 years old. This is a nostalgic little game indeed. Very short, could maybe even consider it a full length demo. Definitely worth playing through once or twice."
26,funny hdr valve game
27,"this would be better if it was longer. BUT...i liked the gameplay. 9.5/10
"
28,scared the fuck outta me whenever this game was on my computer and I didn't see the actual half life 2
29,I found the Coast. Fisherman/10
30,idk why but this made me paranoid might be because im paranoid right now idk
31,This is a fun but short little demo for the HDR technology implemented in the source engine. If you liked Half-Life 2 and want more then you should play this. The location of a beach town with a monastery is unique and looks great and the gunfights feature a lot of verticality because of the cliff walls which was something never really seen in the base game. Also check out the developer commentary because it's rather interesting.
32,why the hell is this game getting updated?
33,"Best Half-Life game, maybe even the best game of all Time 10/10 this game changed my life, oped my third eye. and made me a zillionar. Would Recommend"
34,it's somewhat similar to the Half-Life: Uplink demo

45,"good tech demo, i rlly like the fisherman"
46,i love half life and i always enjoy playing but this short game should have been free and its not worth buying
47,.
48,it's really meh
49,the coast is clearly there though
50,i rate it voice commentary out of 10
51,"""the more things change the more they stay the same"" bounderys shift new players step in but power allways finds a place to rest its head"" ""we foute and bleed next to the russians and we should have known that they would hate us for it"" ""history is riten by the victor and here i am thinking we won"" ""but you bring down one enemy and they find some one even worse to replase them"" locations change the rashinal the objective yesterdays enemys are todays recruits train them to fight alonge sid you and pray they dont deside to hate you for it too"" general shepherd modern warfare 2....

52,eh it's okay it's like 25 minutes short
53,Great classic tech demo with a nice action sequence.
54,Its a pretty good tech demo. But its not a good game.
55,nice just really short
56,Even if you're not into learning the technical parts of the making of Half-Life 2 it's still a nice short Half-Life 2 level.
57,"It was a great experience to hear from the developers' mouths the stages of the game, their imaginations and what they wanted to do.It was a nice mini-chapter where they introduced their new technologies to us. Grateful for this experience"
58,"a strange dlc. i enjoyed the commentary, but thats about all this dlc has gong for it.

also a good way to run a stress test on lower end hardware."
59,Short but sweet
60,"Hearing Gaben talk about Half life on a coast (lost) was truly an experience. 10/10 would play again very good. 

also don`t forget to send an email to gaben at the end of the ""game""  about your framerate :D"
61,hdr is good
62,good but not worth buying
63,Its a good demo

68,It's interesting to hear and see how some of hl2 works in terms of performance and level design. It would be interesting to see this for other games.
69,"When the coast is lost

70,"it was and it's still short game
this is so short shorter than demo lol"
71,yes
72,I spent hours looking for the Lost Coat but couldn't find it. Still enjoyed it!

75,This Half-life 2 thing is looking very promising!!!
76,Sexy graphics
77,"Once upon a time me and this old lady got drunk in colombia and we kinda started a massive drug war and then got in some trouble with the colombian government which ended in the destruction of colombian democracy and then i became the somewhat illegitimate dictator of colombia. but unfortunately the americans came to try to restore colombian democracy so in response to this i snorted 2 kg of cocaine and ran at them with a shotgun. i forgot what happened next but according to the US marines/my followers i became a cocaine fueled god and murdered 90% of their platoon. the rest of them started a religion around my highness and marksmanship. then we turned colombia into a new holy land committed to spreading the message of me and my religion. we then converted all of the colombian natives into my followers and conquered venezuela ecuador and panama. we then developed nuclear weapons and bombed all of south america's population centers and then genocided the rest of them with my followers. We united south america and created the greatest era of peace and prosperity in the continent's history. we rivaled the US and china in influence and we spread our religion far and wide and created unrest in the rest of the world until they followed us and joined our empire. after conquering the world and making its population worship me, i connected them all to the internet in an electronic hive mind, and finally i integrated my brain and body with the internet to instructed, control and dominate humanity. i became the Deus Ex Machina, i became the God of the Machine.

oh yeah half life 2 lost coast is fun ig"

79,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
80,"Beautiful beach, very fitting for Quarter to One Life"
81,fun and short
82,"huh, that was short. Cool though"
83,"From the store page description: ""Originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2, Lost Coast is a playable technology showcase that introduces High Dynamic Range lighting to the Source engine.""

Yeah, it is exactly that. You can complete it in roughly 10 minutes. More free Half Life 2 content, so, yay?"
84,a good 15 minutes game
85,Short but cool game if you're into visuals and the source engine
86,"I recommend you give this little lost chapter a look just because it's a cool little window into what gaming's priorities, standards, stylistic attitudes were like kind of circa 2006."
87,"A kind of DLC for the original Half-Life 2. Is essentially a test room for improvements to the graphics engine, such as HDR lighting, facial expressions or texturing. Coupled with developer commentary, it looks very cool. You can learn a lot of details about the game development process."
88,Enemy encounters felt better than hl2
89,I hope you like leeches
90,coast wasnt lost
91,he killed me
92,Fish

95,"""HDR"" is apparently an ugly colour palette and too much bloom

Half-Life 2 is good though"
96,
97,"First thing with ""Half-Life"" name on it that i dont like."
98,"fish man
laugh"
99,"Short and sweet, nothing to gain by playing this but is a fun challenge on hard for sure."
100,"it's simple, they wanted to show off there HDR lighting before the 2 episodes arrived"
101,It's half life so i enjoy it
102,good example for any young game devs to understand the thought process and how much work it take to make a legendary title such as Half Life 2.
103,"easily the best half life game. very long playthrough length and incredible story, the level design is impeccable, absolutely zero glitches."
104,ㅤ
105,"A test map for HDR and some of the newer implementations of Half-Life 2's Episodes, it's short but it's sweet and the commentary is top notch for more in-depth Behind the Scenes information."
106,Absolute waste of time. WTF is this garbage lmao
107,"I really liked the commentary mode for the game. Keep doing stuff like this, this was cool."
108,Best half-life game
109,Cool tech demo.
110,mmm yes technology oooo lighting oooo gordon fishman.....
111,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a very short but good game.
"
112,"""Originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2, Lost Coast is a playable technology showcase that introduces High Dynamic Range lighting to the Source engine.""

Short ~25 minute demo showing off the potential of HDR. Have nothing bad to say about the experience"
113,"Although originally intended to be a level for half-life 2 Lost Coast was ultimately cut and it's not hard to see why.
The level is unlike any in half-life 2 as it feels unbalanced, incomplete and amateurish.
Being reused as a tech demo to showcase High-Dynamic lighting in the source engine it fails it's job as the version of source found in this game is behind most source games such as Half-life 2 and it's episodes, CS:GO and Team Fortress 2.

You're not missing anything not playing this and if you do it'll be like any mediocre Netflix show as it completely exists your head once done with it.

Edit: Due to Lost Coast being ran on a old version of the source engine many bugs have occurred such as the skybox flickering as well as the water having a missing textures."
114,i mean i understand what the developers of this game were going for especially gabe newell but i think they attempted to produce this with not the same etchisits that the original gam ehad i understand this was supposed to be a short tutorial of sorts but i dont thing this game was receavied witht he amount of love its predecessors got so thats why i shall humbluels say with unfortuante laosst this game is sus
115,truly the greatest half-life game ever
116,"just bad. missing textures, puzzles which take a long time (which i dont like) and more things. dont get it."
117,its a short nice game good for a little run around easy to beat and really fun!
118,"Hi this is Gabe Newell and welcome to the lost coast. In this tour, we're going to be talking about a new graphics technology we've been designing, called High Dynamic Range, or HDR."
119,"A super short demo for Half-Life 2 (And by super short, I do seriously mean it). It contains the basic gameplay that HL 2 has today like the same weapon variety and taking down a chopper with rockets. Story is decent but you need to remember that this game is stupid short and is just a demo, so you cant really expect much lore other than Gordon Fisherman. For a demo it's really good, it shows the basics and quirks of HL 2. Funnily enough though, I played this demo AFTER completing HL 2: Ep 2. If you have this in your library and have a solid like, 20 mins to kill or so then play it, it's fun for what it's worth."
120,"My favorite part was when the fisherman said ""I guess this is it, we are on... The lost coast."" Shit myself after that."
121,nice graphics and doesnt kill my computer. also funny gordon fish man joke. the dev commentary was very informative on how the source shaders work.
122,I tried to jump off the scaffolding into the ocean and broke my legs 10/10

124,Definitely Gordon Fishman
125,This and HDTF are the only good half life games
126,"Half-Life 2: Life Coast is a tech demonstration rather than a game. It shows off high-dynamic-range rendering in the Source Engine. The gameplay is short and not related to the Half-Life Lore. 

It includes 3 modes: Easy, Medium, and, Hard.
1. Easy: Too easy, don't play this. Difficulty 0/10;
2. Medium: Again easy. Difficulty 0/10;
3. Hard: Also easy and not a challenge at all. Difficulty: 1/10.

Weapons: Same as the Half-Life 2 franchise.

Multiplayer: No.

Overall, It's good in the view of a tech demonstration. Gameplay and lore-wise, nope."
127,i think i found the coast
128,"too boring. dont play it



pls give award"
129,This is a wholesome experience
130,"I love the part when Gordon says ""I found the coast they lost"" ... so heartbreaking"
131,short but cool
132,They weren't lying
133,"I opened the game, it crashed, my graphic doesn't support it. I opened it again, started the game, it crashes. I play it again, I'm about to pass it, it crashes.
I play it again, it crashes again.
I run it without any problem, I check my pc in case there was something strange open, indeed,

141,wut is this? git now
142,"It was an interesting experience, seeing how the game is made, and finding out how a game engine is modified to make room for future improvements."
143, quarter-life 7/10
144,Best game of the series
145,"this single chapter has the best story line of all time, It brought me to tears within the first five minutes, why did they cut this 2/10"
146,yup that sure was a bonus half-life map
147,"Short, fun, and taught me what HDR even is."
148,now add fishing
149,can valve really count to 3
150,"Very interesting look into the design process of the team at Valve. Great for those interested in game design, or just overall have an interest in the creation of art."
151,"Its just an extra mission but it is quite fun, also its free with half life 2 so no need to worry about paying for it."
152,My favorite in the franchise! A must play!
153,"An informative addition to HL2 highlighting the Source technologies. Although I've already learned these facts from YouTube videos, it's been a pleasure to recall them in interactive manner."
154,"shorter than I thought it would be but, still a fun add on for half life."
155,"this isn't half life 3!!!!!11!!1!1!1!!!!!11!!!!!

164,"Pretty good for what it is, being a tech showcase and all. Nice little area to mess around in with console commands."
165,A really fun demo to play.
166,"Not bad game, Level is short and you can mount it to gmod. Backstory is unknown and the guy is just there, Not bad but hard a little. Since this is just upgraded source engine because of graphics being a little better."
167,this is worst than the the one before one chapter!!!!!! >:(
168,"half life fisherman
"
169,"great
"
170,the coast is lost (very much like my father)
171,"What Uplink was to the original Half-Life, Lost Coast is to Half-Life 2; a non-canonical, self-contained Half-Life story that also serves as a tech-demo for the features of its engine. If you want to feel out how good your PC would be at running source-based games it might be worth trying out but other than that there is more substantial Half-Life content available."
172,a short but fun experience
173,very speedrunable
174,"Beautiful short tech demo of the new 2005 Source engine HDR lighting.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2831811994"
175,"This game took me like 15 minutes to finish, but I played it again for the included 14 pieces of developer commentary.

Its really fun, has some one time samples of some valve game mechanics, and doesn't overplay each one. Plus the showcased lighting tech is fun to point out, and its still better than many modern game's lighting. Anyways who could get bored playing any game for 15 minutes? Give it a try, its good."
176,"best part of the trilogy, found my dad here"
177,gordon fishman
178,it's like half life 2 but lost coast
179,This is actually good like they actually went for realism
180,WHERES OSAMAAAAAAAAA??!?!?!?!?!?
181,"Well, you're lost. For you to be a little more lost, jump into the water.

Overall Review: It's short, You can watch a youtube video on it."
182,"My personal favorite of the Half Life series. This game features riveting back straightening content which always keeps me glued to the screen to see the next thing to see. The features were very much there and there was an incredible amount of movement features which Valve so beautifully integrated into the brand new Source engine. All of the gameplay mechanics were beautifully crafted and fine tuned to the point of perfection to the finest detail. I cannot give any more amount of respect to the employees who worked on Half Life 2: Lost Coast as it gives the player the true experience of not only the source engine, but the entire Half Life universe along with it. 

I cannot begin to describe how filled with passion I am for this game and I wish to communicate the lengths I am willing to go through to give this game the support it deserves for its sequel. Thank you Valve for creating this digital masterpiece unrivaled by anything of mortal human creation since the invention of ancient Chinese philosophy. Gaben you are my hero"

198,fishman
199,You need it to complete it.
200,"i got this bundled with HL2, good insight on how HL2 works i guess."
201,Neat for what it is (a showcase). The ability to listen to commentary is cool.
202,I found the coast
203,i lost my crowbar :(
204,Balls: Lost Balls
205,A bit short but it's Half-life.
206,"isnt actually a game, but a showcase. still fun tho"
207,I would say that this is a beautiful introduction to the Half-Life 2 game. It's short and the graphics are beautiful. Gameplay is fantastic just as you will find in HL2. This would be a great demo for the game if this part was in the game. As it is it's good advertisement and a good way to promote the game.
208,"

Damned This tech demo just hits different in 2022 ! Almost crashed my RTX !


"
209,18 Minute
210,good
211,those were nice explanations ngl
212,combine gunship disguised as a chopper
213,no idea wtf is going on
214,better than Half Life Source
215,greatest digital experience anyone could have
216,Forget G-Man! The Fisherman is the most mysterious character in the Half Life universe
217,Pretty good tech demo. It comes with HL2 when you buy it so your not losing any money if you don't like it. Time to beat it can be done in 15 or 20 mins.
218,real life
219,its a good demo
220,"Even though it takes you only about 15 minutes, it's still more fun that most of the Half-Life 2 mods that I found."
221,Doesn't have a fishing minigame even tho it has a fisherman
222,pretty epic
223,I took a nice little hiking trip
224,Short but sweet. Really sweet. The story & characters are cool and the graphics are good.
225,"Well if you want to play Half-Life 2 but don't wanna do a whole new play through then this works fine.

Short 12 minute game without lore that has Half-Life 2 themes."
226,The Fisherman is truly the greatest character in the Half-Life franchise.
227,     790 / 1.000
228,A true classic Half-Life game. This is a must play game!
229,it's free!
230,Gordon Fisherman
231,Lost coast is a nice cut content tbh and with the commentary available it gives you more time to waste listening to VALVe's employees things they did on the source engine and basically on the code it's also nice 15 min. of killing combine and basically being an anti-citizen
232,this is just a tech demo still pretty good tho
233,The video stress test is F****** amazing
234,"As a person who enjoyes lookin indepth about game design, this little tech demo is quiet good insight of valve devs thought process when they still made games."
235,play it if u want but i think its good
236,Source engine is cool and bright.
237,This is the first hl2 game with high dynamic range
238,if it was cut they would have cut npcs....... still good
239,"Played it once, says i played 90 hours of it for some reason."

246,"Short experience, doesn't really do much for the Half-Life 2 story unless you're really into the lore, but fun and beautiful nonetheless."
247,"wtf, i found the coast within a few seconds of playing the game
it shouldn't be called ""Half-Life 2: Lost Coast""
it should be called ""Half-Life 2: Found Coast""
because i found it ON the title screen!
fun game though"
248,"It may be short, but it is fun to play."
249,"Kinda pointless, and I don't see how it connects to the main story, but it's a fun little romp."
250,Meh.

253,I like.
254,Good
255,1/5
256,very short game
257,waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa good gameaz
258,"8.5/10

~15 mins of playtime in a level not included in the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2. It's fun to see what the developers made and scrapped. The developer commentary included with the level gives insights into what the developers had in mind. The vertical level design in the stage is something not seen that much in Half-Life 2 and is instead more prominently seen in Half-Life 1 with its chapter ""Surface Tension"". Overall a fun experience."
259,i want the fisherman to stab me with his harpoon
260,
261,"It's pretty short, but it's fun.
"
262,i got stuck on a part
263,"Wow this first level is really cool, I wonder what the next one i- *Credits*"
264,lost cum
265,is nice 20 min game
266,It's half life. What more can be said.
267,"Despite it literally being a cut part of Highway 17 and just a tech demo for HDR, its absolutely amazing.

This demo shows how powerful the source engine is when it comes to HDR lighting, its like RTXs little, weaker brother.

Gameplay and combat wise its the same as HL2 but i do like it when the combine try to ambush or flank me on the stairs.

Music is sad? it fits in very well after almost reaching the end.

One thing that bothers me about this is that this was meant to be a cut part of highway 17, yet this doesnt fit in at any part of the chapter. my guess is that they removed it because its obscurity with the rest of H17 or they remade/rebuilt the chapter from the ground up.

9/10"
268,kinda half assed but good
269,"Not a game per se, just a mediocre playground for some experimental visual settings and physics."
270,it definitely exists
271,It destroyed my graphics when it came out :D Still a lovely short game.
272,i think it would be funny if instead of lost coast it was called lost poop
273,where is the coast and why is it lost
274,I don't get it...
275,crowbar guy gopes fishing for 15 minutes and kills at least 40 people in that time
276,"This is just an additional level in the Half Life 2 game where the developers created it with a more focused purpose to showcase how they developed the HL2 and what are some of the meticulous details they had to take into account to ensure the quality of the audio, visual and mechanics can give players a great gaming experience.

Not something I would recommend you to download and play because again, this is just an additional level where the developers create narrations of how they developed the game."
277,"Played it back in 05, was wowed by the lighting then. Can't say it held up today, had some flickering here and there.

But that wasn't why I played it. I recently played through Portal 2 with the developer commentary, so I decided to go through all Valve games with it.
Had forgotten how fun this little vertical -literally- slice of games was. 

If you're into game development, or just curious about the worlds Valve build, I highly recommend playing through it."
278,"weird little demo for Half-Life 2. somehow I have 90+ hours in this game (no idea how, the game itself only takes about 20 min to beat). The story is pretty simple, Gordon Freeman breaks a headcrab canister, fights a hunter chopper, and saves St. Olga. as far as canonicity to the Half-Life series goes, St. Olga is a canon area (according to a poster Half-Life Alyx), but as for the events of this game themselves, I'm not sure whether or not they are cannon. Perhaps this was a test for Gordon by the gman...
7/10"
279,Steam deck compatible
280,"It's Half-Life, but only 20 minutes long. There is also Gaben and you can visit his shrine in this game."
281,"cool tech demo
yay"
282,well it is more half life 2
283,It's a very quick and fun bit of Half-Life 2 that was cut out of the main game; think of this as Valve giving you a piece of chocolate: you'll definitely want more afterwards because that little bit was so damn sweet.
284,Very informative about how the Source engine works.
285,­
286,Cool extra.
287,i was looking for the coast for 15 minutes then realized I was already on the coast.. anyone know why it's called lost coast???
288,I love The Fisherman. He's my favorite character. Would play it again.
289,Teaser for secret endboss of the franchise.
290,A game engine showcase but still pretty cool
291,Idk a thing about it ive never played it
292,the number one solution for desperate 12 year olds who really want to play the actual game but can't convince their parents to buy it for them
293,i need more
294,Bite-sized half life 2
295,A short little demo test for the main game. Not much to say really.
296,Unga Bunga!
297,"Can’t believe this is what’s happening  in Denmark rn, praying for them 🙏"
298,It's just a tech demo.
299,Yes
300, If you thought The Witcher3 was a masterpeice..... you never played this game !!!!
301,good game but too short xd.
302,"pretty fun mini-mission

valve should make more like this"
303," Short but perfect, the commentary points were amazing to!"
304,the half life game of all time
305,This is a pointless little bonus mission that came with HL2 for me but would have been better off integrated into the original product at some point. Don't go out of your way to play it but I thought it was rather comfortable.
306,it's short but good
307,"If your'e looking for a game with a story you won't ever forget in your life, then this is the perfect game for you, 10/10 would smash again"
308,This really short showcase of High Dynamic range lighting is interesting to explore just to see one of the cut maps from Half Life 2. It comes free with Half Life 2 so I don't see why exactly its bad. I guess I recommend this just to explore more of the beautiful world of HL2.
309,That HDR rendering looked good
310,Bottom-tier level design like this is why this garbage chapter was cut from HL2 in the first place
311,It's a tech demo for Half Life 2.
312,i eated it all
313,Play with commentary and be sure to ride the elevator down at the end.
314,"short n sweet, just the single task, not too difficult, but just enough of a test to keep you on your toes"
315,Visit the Coast
316,Great to start with but i think it was really short but it was fun anyways i was confused at the start but then i set of the machine and the game was done but still good
317,Half-Life is the LIFE of scientists and fighters..
318,warner bros pictures presents in association with legendary pictures and village roadshow pictures

326,"short tho, but good"
327,"Fun tech demo, probably not worth the download for most people."
328,A bit more fun along the (high)way.
329,"As you'll find out, its literally a tech demo for HL2, plus you might as well try it out, since it seems to be bundled with every sale of HL2."
330,half life island edition
331,yep thats a game
332,this game is fun and cool. also it's super easy to speedrun. i one finished it in 2 mins
333,"Just an engine test from Valve. Still really good, as the graphics of the Episodes are based off of this.
10/10 for effort and graphical improvements."
334,very good game i cant wait for when half-life Alyx: Lost Coast comes out
335,Super short I beat it in like 9 minutes BUT its fun.
336,"Wait, what is this again?

The good:
It's a fun Half-Life 2 level. 
It's a free tech demo.

The meh:
Even though it's old as the hills, there was a tad bit of FPS slowdown on my potato laptop.

The bad:
It's literally 22 minutes long give or take.

The verdict: It's a lunch break's worth of classic HL2.  Since I haven't played it in years, it was a blast of nostalgia."
337,It's very interesting an facinating game in fact i like the idea behind it also the eifficult aproaces that you can use to pass the level unfortunately there is only one level we need more of it.
338,"This tech demo is fairly nice, it introduced developer commentary and also added HDR. Oh yeah and it can run on a potato so get it."
339,"[h1]English[/h1]

Short but fun game for in-between

[h1]Deutsch[/h1]

Kurzes, aber spaßiges Spiel für zwischendurch"
340,second best half life game after hl1
341,its fun but short its good for if you're in the mood for something short its at least 25 minutes to beat it makes you think out side of the box
342,Excellent expansion pack.
343,"That... is an 8/10.

It is a high rating for a mere showcase, but honestly I like the fact Valve gave some insight into the making of their games in this short game format. It's certainly a fun way to show off their stuff and for us to learn too. And seriously, even now the graphics with their unique style give me an eyegasm."
344,I don't know how I put 33 hours into this game but I must've enjoyed it as a 13 year-old.
345,It's..... cool?
346,Not half-life 3
347,"This is so cool. This is not the biggest deal ever as it is just a technology showcase, but damn. Thank you Valve for making this, I found it extremely interesting."
348,no recommend
349,"Good demo btw, but does this come bundled with Half-Life 2? It was not in the list when I bought the Orange Box."
350,God gonna be pissed you blew up his church
351,Full Death: Found Inland
352,most likely one of the games ever made
353,good game:D
354,"a ""scrapped"" level to showcase the HDR lighting in source engine.
for it's time, it is pretty good, and it looks good even in today
the level itself is good, and even has a boss at the end"
355,this game is awesome
356,hafl lif 2 lost cost
357,great if you played half-life 2 when you were 6 like me and want to try out all of the weapons because you're not good enough at the base game to get them there.
358,bomb african villages: lost coast
359,Better than Found Coast.
360,Lostcoast
361,Those are some wet rocks

363,THIS IS A SMALL PREVIEW BUILD TO HALF-LIFE 2 IDEAS. IT'S INTERESTING TOO SEE WHAT THE DEVELOPERS HAD IN MIND FOR THIS GAME!
364,"The leeches are a lie.
The leeches are a lie.
The leeches are a lie.
The leeches are a lie.
The leeches are a lie."
365,"I loved this look into some of the methods used to make games and would love more content like this or suggestions to more like this, Thanks."
366,IS nice
367,"These morons, I found the coast in the first 5 seconds of the damn game."
368,gordon fishman
369,Fun.
370,Literally just a tech demo lol
371,traktuję to jak demo naszego ukochanego pół-życia 2
372,"It's a good game, its just fun and enjoyable its just a fun short 15 minute mini game so basically a half life short."
373,it's well made but can be a bit confusing some time but overall good
374,"best game to ever exist
"
375,Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is one of the games in the world.
376,Yes
377,"Short, but pretty good."
378,Very short. takes about 15 minutes or less. Still a fun bit of expansion though.
379,"This is a short, yet sweet tech demo.   I do have to mention that the water is unstable though."
380,Gordon Fishman
381,Good tech demo.
382,good short level good that it exit cos more half life 2
383,Waiting for Lost Coast 3
384,it's a ok game....Imagine half life with new and graphics that's what this game is.
385,"This short game is wonderful. The HDR lighting is beautiful, done flawlessly. The Developer Commentary is one of my favorite staples of valve games, and I love this game for the fact that it introduced them.

I truly wish this was canon, as the fisherman is a very interesting character. He isn't phased by gordon just disappearing (possibly being taken away by the gman), which got me thinking that the fisherman is sort of the antithesis to the G-Man, but that theory's for another time.

Overall, I love this, Good work. Thanks, I had fun."
386,"Defenetly good game, quietly a short game....."
387,"Anyone that expected a lot from this is an idiot

There's a reason this didn't cost money. It's basically a tech demo of what Half-Life 2 will give you. It's literally exactly what the description entales, and nothing more"
388,"Отличная игра, я её прошёл за 14 минут"
389,"Takes longer to install than play, what the fxxk."
390,"no, just
no"
391,the leeches
392,Expected more but the fisherman is cool.
393,fancy graphic
394,fisherman is cool i guess
395,cock and balls
396,A cool tech demo explaining some technology behind the Source Engine and Half Life 2.
397,love it so cool definitely like seeing how they developed Half-Life 2 it's very interesting and I really enjoyed it definitely would love to see more Tech demos like this in the future games
398,Good thrilling plot with lots of action and problem to solve.
399,A good tech demo.
400,A quick warm up to the full game!
401,good
402,"i found the coast
"
403,"Best game ive ever played, i might have cried over the beautiful graphics in the source, the gameplay is amazing and it sets the bar for every other game, thank you valve"
404,"I wanna see the fisherman again, I love him"
405,yes
406,"A nice extra piece of Half-Life 2. Standalone and arguably not canon it does feel like with some minor adjustment for the sake of continuity it could fit in perfectly during the coastal section of the main game itself.
A perfect demonstration of the look and feel of the series at this stage, with a taste of what to expect for newcomers in terms of technology and play mechanics, and how the engine itself was being developed throughout by showcasing the then new technical feats. A nice short play and with it good narrative."
407,"Pretty bland, but it came for free so I don't have much to complain about. It feels a lot like a single mission in Half Life 2, so making it a free DLC was a good idea. Once you've finished Half Life 2 you will have no issue with wiping this out in 15 minutes like I did."
408,gordon fishmen
409,"This game is really a demo, a tech demo perhaps, for the proper Half Life game. It's about 30 minutes long and is good within that. But don't pay for it for gods' sake! It presumably came free with something if you got it. I'm not ticking ""came free"" cos I had to pay for the bundle this was in, but you shouldn't be able to pay for it separately, and it would be a bad idea if you could. 

That said it's a fun half hour, doesn't really have the Half Life 2 atmosphere but shows off the graphics nicely. They were pretty cool in 2005!
"
410,fishman say weeoooo massive W
411,"found the coast, so its not actually a lost coast?"
412,Short but fun!
413,"the main game is truly amazing and is a must play, this however is basically completely pointless, Thank F**k its free"
414,
415,Sausage.
416,NO STOP!!!
417,Hello Gordon Fisherman!
418,When are the Black Mesa guys getting a hold of this?
419,You will complete the game by the time you finish saying Half-life 2 Lost coast.
420,"It's short, but it's sweet and informative. With the commentary on, I get to learn how Valve developed their two episodes. Honestly, this feels like a demo or an interactive museum than an actual game, but that doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable."
421,i am not lost!!!!!!! only 50% of the game has been given to me absolute scame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
422,fisherman
423,"Golden years Valve; they gave out a free level/chapter of HL2 cause HDR Lighting. they then skipped HDR monitors, Raytracing..."
424,This game had an orthodox monastery. 10/10
425,Really gud
426,"Should have been remastered for the beginning of HL3, not this lame VR malarkey."
427,10/10 best 10 mins of my life and would get brain damage to forget i played this just to play it again.
428,developer mode
429,The single longest game I've ever played.
430,Gaben's last words: I can't really say anything about Half Life 3.
431,cant really not recommend it. its pretty much just ~10 more minutes of hl2 gameplay
432,cool story
433,"Well, the mod is completed for about 16 minutes. Its pretty cool mod also there are couple of mods for Half-Life 2, i guess the most popular one is Counter-Life i cant wait to test some mods for Half-Life 2 :)"
434,UuUuUuUuUh pretty lightning
435,One day...one day we will see Half Life 3
436,"The speedrun time is around 3 seconds, can you think of an other games so hardcore that the pros can go that fast?"
437,"Looks cool, plays cool, sounds cool, gives me extra half life 2 content, its all good in my book.
8/8 would replay every once in a while"
438,"Lots of interesting things to learn, thumbs up"
439,"every short, like me olga"
440,Good
441,Valve flexing its graphics back in 2005 xD
442,its ight
443,"full-death 3: found coast. ok srsly tho this game is broken and that makes it 100% better imo. i like broken games. and also it would be a crime not to mention le accelerated back hop combined with grenade, smg or rocket jumping srsly that combo is broken as hell. oh yeah and you cant kill the fisherman anymore. sad :(."
444,a nice quick rest after all the hell you've been through in the main game. enjoyed listening to geniuses explaining their craft
445,"insanely easy and short, but nothing crazy I wouldn't say its bad but I would say it's good either."
446,Changed my outlook on life. Very inspirational.
447,epic
448,nothing special
449,100% recommended for people who like leaches
450,i found the coast :D
451,"game = good
"
452,"Good, although very short. It shows all the basic mechanics of Half Life 2, however I found myself completing it in less than 15 minutes."
453,GUYS HELP I LOST MY COAST
454,run on 13 yer old laptop fine
455,better than hunt down the freeman.
456,oh my horbry dreames I carn't foib te losted coast
457,it is good but.. TOO SHORT!!!! :steammad: ):<
458,Took me 20 min to figure out I had to dam the thing in the church
459,lost
460,"A decent Tech Demo I suggest looking at in the wake of finishing Half-Life 2.

These days the exhibited HDR tech isn't actually that great any longer since it has effectively been carried out in many games since Half Life Lost Coast saw the day !

Anyway the designer critique is an amazing expansion and gives you some knowledge on the way in which HDR really fills in just as a few different pieces of data in regard to even out plan and such, it features how complex making a computerized world that is likewise amusing to interact in genuinely is.
"
461,"This is a nice little insight into the game production and what went into making it. I enjoyed it a lot as I have done some game coding before, and seeing how such a great game was created was fascinating. Not really any lore here or anything, just a production insight, very short."
462,An absolute retro classic! The game that heralded the rest in terms of the FPS Genre. Even on easy mode its entertaining and fun with puzzles and BFG's to suit every taste.
463,"HDR - Hide, Don't Run
Great... umm... GAME? 
Whatever..."
464,atleast this is better then hunt down the freeman
465,Just challenging enough to be fun. Thanks!
466,"Who would have thought taking a level from the cutting room floor and recycling it into a demo would be a great idea! 
"
467,"It’s a neat opportunity to explore some of HL2’s cut content. It’s short but fun, and looks good."

THIS LIGHT DEMO AINT SHI-"
469,wonder how much temperature people get on their pcs in 2005 while running this game
470,A delightfully fun extra level to one of the best games ever made.
471,[h1][b]good demo of Source from Valve bravo
472,Great
473,Crowbar demo.
474,don't worry guys i found the coast
475,based tech demo
476,"split my life in half, 2 lost cost"
477,ahead of its time with the lighting technology
478,This is for when you beat half life 2 and need something to play......
479,Nice demo for the source engine
480,This game is shorter than Teylo's dick.
481,"Indeed, a video game."
482,I wish if game developers were that interested in making games like the golden age of valve.
483,"This is a pretty short play. It took about half an hour. However, I did have commentary on and I was looking around a bit. I am sure if you avoided that, it would go faster. However, that would defeat the purpose of this release. The short storyline is good and it is a nice somewhat change of scenery from hl2. The ending is short, but well done. It gave me chills.  It is a great opportunity to learn about what goes on behind the scenes in terms of game design. You'll year from people such as GabeN and Robin Walker. I think I will replay this game from time to time to refresh my memory and because overall it is very well designed. The commentary is fantastic, I will be revisiting that as well. The ending gives me goose bumps, it is fantastic."
484,cool
485,The best Half Life game of them all.
486,"Spoiler alert!



















You find the lost coast! It's just a tech demo, but I would still check it out."
487,Yeah it's good i guess?
488,"Cool tech demo, wish they made one for Alyx but eh."
489,fisherman go brrrrr
490,7/10
491,"its half life, so buy. it's pretty good but i finished in like 5 min"

498,Pretty cool
499,THIS GAME IS SO HARD

501,half life dlc but idk is developer commentary is cool i guess
502,untapped meme potential; should have been in ep2 or smn

506,"Went in for Half-Life 2, left with unparalleled knowledge about the High Dynamic Range lighting in the Source engine."
507,"this is the definition of Half Life 2 Beta lore vs the actual Half Life 2 lore 

hl2 beta lore was better btw"
508, Listening to the commentary in 2022 with so many years of technical evolution in games is surreal. It's like listening to a caveman tell you about the wonderful new technology of the wheel
509,a strange part of valve history but a interesting demo
510,"Half-Life 2 Lost Coast is simple short & enjoyable experience despite being an Tech Demo.
If you enjoyed Half-Life 2 then you will get a kick out of this relic from the past.

It even includes a Benchmarking tool that can be used on low-end systems, thought if you are going to use it you will probably expect an FPS between 60 & 9999 depending on hardware."
511,Now lost coast i really don't have a opinion on I've played but its meh.
512,"After all these years since playing, for some reason this tech demo takes me back, and when it faded to black at the end it hit hard.

For those looking for a brief nostalgia trip, I reccomend."
513,It's soo broken
514,cool
515,"A nice tech demo and great way to test out your PC (though if it cannot run this, then you probably need a new PC)."
516,its good but it only took 15 mins
517,Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a free level for Half-Life released by Valve. Created to demonstrate new features of the Source engine. It is the first Valve game with built-in developer commentary (which later began to be added to all single games of this company). Distributed via Steam.
518,GOOD
519,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is very reminiscent of the game, Half-Life 2. This can be for several reasons, namely that it is Half-Life 2. This game also tends to provide a similar play style to the popular game, Half-Life. This is likely due to the fact that Half-Life 2 is the predecessor to Half-Life, therefore explaining the similar style of game play. Additionally, this game includes a set of unique design quirks. Some good examples are the addition of ""key binds"" to move your character around, along with ""volume"" to adjust your volume. To conclude, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is one of the games I have ever played."
520,Level ktory sa do finalnej hry nedostal tak sluzi ako demo a ukazka Source Enginu
521,"Educational and fun

I like it"
522,for a tech demo from 2005 it actually still kinda holds up imo its super short but you get with half life 2 for free so theres nothing to really complain about
523,"Not even 30 minutes,but an amazing tech demo and level..."
524,Funny Fishman
525,"best 11 minutes of my life
"
526,what the heck
527,"A decent Tech Demo I suggest looking at in the wake of finishing Half-Life 2.

These days the exhibited HDR tech isn't actually that great any longer since it has effectively been carried out in many games since Half Life Lost Coast saw the day !

Anyway the designer critique is an amazing expansion and gives you some knowledge on the way in which HDR really fills in just as a few different pieces of data in regard to even out plan and such, it features how complex making a computerized world that is likewise amusing to interact in genuinely is.

Really awful Lamarr isn't in it !"
528,At least its better than hunt down the freeman that's for sure.
529,good addon
530,"Commentary was okay, gameplay was bad."
531,"A nice little Tech Demo I recommend checking out after completing Half Life 2.

Nowadays the showcased HDR tech is not really that impressive anymore because it has actively been implemented in many games since Half Life Lost Coast saw the day !

However the developer commentary is an awesome addition and gives you some insight on how HDR actually works as well as some other bits of information when it comes to level design and such, it showcases how complex creating a digital world that is also fun to intereact in truly is.

Too bad Lamarr is not in it !"
532,69 minutes. i am not playing this game ever again
533,It's decent for what it is.
534,"Guess its a nice little extra for half life, only bout 20 - 30 minutes, maybe 40 - 50 if you do both the dev commentary and just the regular game, overall just a nice extra chapter."
535,"If you were looking forward to getting Lost Coast but couldn't find a ""Buy This Game"" button anywhere on the store page, you need to own HL2 to be able to play Lost Coast, as this game is basically additional content for HL2, unlike the Episodes.

There's not much for me to review as this game is pretty much content freely and automatically available to all who have HL2 in their library. I write reviews to persuade you to buy or not to buy a game/soundtrack/DLC, but in this case, you already have it if you have HL2. I suppose I can write this review to convince you to install and play it, in case you haven't already.

Anyway, Lost Coast is intended to be a tech demo with design and layout choices specifically made to demonstrate the Source engine's High Dynamic Range rendering or whatever technology. Gameplay-wise, it's very, very short; at the time of this review, I only have 49 minutes of playtime. It also introduces a Developer Commentary mode which I believe is one of the best decisions Valve has made. It's fantastic to learn the thought processes and gameplay decisions behind the scenes, and why things in the game are the way they are. I'm very glad this feature was incorporated into all mainstream Valve games since.

So it may be worthwhile playing, especially if you're into video game graphics tech. Or maybe you might just be in it for the extra level, though it's not really the intent of this add-on content and like I said, it's short."
536,I dunno where this falla in the story and it has so many glitches that you can use tobyoir advantage. Pretty good
537,I don't know why
538,Cool tech demo.
539,Nice short game like give us spent some time before new Valve game release.
540,We’ve been trying to reach you about your car’s extended warranty
541,"Originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2, Lost Coast is a playable technology showcase that introduces High Dynamic Range lighting to the Source engine."
542,"This small tech demo is yet another example of how progressive Valve was in video game development back in 2000s. There wasn't much of games with HDR in that time and so, when Valve implemented this technology into Source engine it was step forward progress indeed.  Also regarding critics of HDR I would like to say that it is very good choice to add in games, which are supposed to look realistically. Yes, just like Half-Life 2."
543,класно мне было интересно чытать как разрабочыки работали уровень хорош ребят берите если хотите узнать как работали разрабы и пройди тестовый уровень качаеться быстро и проходиться менше часа но было класно!
544,"nice nice, cool lightinglike my eye iam impressed, so excited for what the source enginge will do so cool nice"
545,"This is an additional level for Half-Life 2 that was cut during its development. Even though it's short, this level contains several minor story details that are a bit interesting. Anyway, this is mainly a tech demo that showcases the HDR rendering capabilities of the Source Engine. Overall, it's an interesting level."
546,old man with harpoon
547,Most Fun I have Had With Was It Short Gameplay And It`s Gmod Mounting
548,"I like this on.
I've no idea if this is canon or not. If it is, when's it supposed to take place? I guess the coast areas, but there's no area where you could get here. If it's not canon, same applies, but as a theoretical question.
Still, it's a good lost-level type deal, and I had fun playing it.
10/10"
549,"Its half life 2 but shorter. Its alright, but nothing worth praise. I'd probably not finish it, since its not that interesting."
550,cool game but it short 8.3
551,Better than most newly released games to be honest
552,gaben voice at the end made me nut
553,its half life and its by valve so
554,Simply like the game
555,"if you ever think you're dumb:
i genuinely thought this was a continuation of hl2 episode 2"
556,Me when the coast is lost
557,"thank you gaben, vary cool!"
558,I found the coast
559,a fun 17 minutes
560,It's a nice tech demo.
561,help i've lost the coast
562,free
563,"A cut level from Half-Life 2, narrated effectively by some of the employees at Valve and by the main man himself, Gaben. They talk about some of the core new features that were introduced in Half-Life 2, which had not been seen before in games.
It's essentially a tech demo, but the level is well laid out and worth a spin if you really enjoyed the gameplay and level design from the other games."
564,Looks pretty
565,"Not bad, sad to hear that lost coast is cut content from highway 17"
566,amogus
567,The most interesting 20 minutes of my life)
568,pretty cool valve should have kept it in hl2 tho
569,Thank you Gaben
570,masterpiece
571,"It's basically the Uplink of HL2 - a cut level turned into a tech demo - a damn good one I should add. Lost Coast is super short, but a prime example of how impressively well the Source 1 engine has aged. Definitely worth a sliver of your time."
572,Included free with hl2 but really doesn't add anything to the experience. Less than 20 minutes long even in hard mode.
573,😭
574,this game is great!
575,Strong 7 /10
576,"It's definitely a short game, 30 minutes at most, but it's for sure a nice adventure. the fisherman is an odd but cool character and a cool thing is that its a bit of a tutorial to all the weapons and physics in HL2. Overall a decent experience and it also has VR support if you're into that, 7/10."
577,GabeN
578,Valve please make a new game (that I can afford) I'm thinking of replaying 10 minute tech demos by you oh god end my suffering PLEASE!
579,"its a tech demo, its also fun.
play with commentary to hear gaben"
580,:face_with_raised_eyebrow:
581,I have stretched this 5 minute tech demo to 10 hours
582,"I didn't expect there to be actual enemies on the map, I kinda got jumpscared"
583,gaben beach
584,"the game is like sex, but it's real"
585,i wanted half 2 noit this
586,lost coast more like lost coast
587,I love their voices made me happy made me smile.
588,A ton of fun for something rather inconsequential.
589,valve devs teach you about hdr
590,Half-Life 2: Lost Coast
591,this is is the only half life game i actually own wtf
592,VERY short. But worth a play.
593,It's a simple yet interesting map and tech demo. Listing to the developer commentary was enjoyable to find out how they design maps and how the engine worked.
594,"The coast isn’t lost, your standing on it"
595,A tech demo somehow is a better game than many modern releases.
596,"Well, its free and it's a half-life game ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

599,"[b][u][h1]A Cynical Review: Half Life 2 – Lost Coast[/h1][/u][/b]

[b][u]Is There A Plot?:[/u][/b]
Lost Coast a side Chapter that takes place around the same time as the Highway 17 Chapter in Half Life 2. The Combine have taken over a Byzantine style church along the coast & Freeman must liberate it. This side Chapter was used by Valve as a show case for their high-dynamic-range rendering. The vistas look great!

[b][u]Is This Even Fun?:[/u][/b]
This side Chapter is extremely short & can be completed in under half an hour even on the Hardest Difficulty. It is definitely still a Half Life game however & is still quite fun despite its length. 

[b][u]100% Achievements:[/u][/b]
There are no Achievements to be earned in this game.

[b][u]Is It Worth Buying?:[/u][/b]
I would not go out of my way to purchase this, but if it came with your Half Life Complete Bundle, I would definitely give it a play. It is still a Half Life game!

[b]7/10[/b]"
600,"It manages to get 3/5 and a recommendation from me, but its not great imo.
Its fairly good but short and there are some ""weird-ish"" stuff. 
But, yeah, it gets a recommendation..."
601,A short but involving level where a number of HL skills are needed.
602,short and sweet good game
603,"Super cool that this comes with Half Life 2 for free. It's sort of a short and sweet 15 minute bonus level for Half Life 2, but it's worth replaying with commentary mode on. It gives you a fun, in-depth look at the development process for Half Life 2, and the commentary nodes freeze all enemy AI so you can just kill off the soldiers while you listen to the developers talk about light reflections and level design and whatnot. 
10/10, I really wish more of their games would include experiences like this."
604,"Great mod for the addition of Half Life 2. The rendering was great for the time this mod was developed, I believe by now rendering for a mod like this would be awesome, but as I said, for the time the mod was developed this was great rendering. My only gripe is I wish the mod went longer, just ended to quickly. I would recommend this mod for any Half Life series game lover."
605,"very cool
"
606,I lost my V-card to the developer's voice when he explained about simulating HDR to create an effect of coming out of a dark space and suddenly being bombarded by bright light.
607,"you get this with Half life 2, Half life 2 is a long story game including this with it is just over the top. Very much worth it to play."
608,still better than hunt down the freeman
609,this is hl3. It really makes you feel like the fisherman.
610,Its very good but is so short. That's all
611,half life 2 lost coast 23 minutes in total
612,awesome`
613,don't recommend this game unless if u want to waste a bit of money its 1 episode long so its like 5 mins
614,good game very nice
615,"This demo has the whole game, so its half-life 2 for free if anybody doesnt want to pay for it :)"
616,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is some kind of show-case made by Valve to introduce their new High Dynamic Range method of applying light inside the Source Engine. Actually, although this is a very technical subject, the developer's commentary that comes with it, is more than worthwhile listening to. It gives quite some insight into how this mini-level was constructed, and even into how HDR lighting actually works. It's not easy to talk about something as complex as this is an easily understandable manner. Fascinating stuff, and for the die-hard Vavle-fans: you even get Gabe Newell's words at the beginning of the commentary ;-).

After playing it through for a second time recently - after having left it aside for over five years - I felt amazed by how lively most of the graphics and - of course - the lighting still look today - a full nine (!!!) years after this level was published. Especially the little Byzantine church, part of the monastery on top of the cliffs, still feels amazing and oozes atmosphere. Valve did a wonderful job with the lighting inside the church, even letting dimmed light through the stained-glass windows. At the same time, it also made me a bit sad, because, well, how long has it been since we got the latest Half-Life content? Oh well, who knows....

Since this one comes for free in the Orange Box and the Half Life 2-complete package, I guess most of you who played Half-Life 2 at some point, have this in your game collection. If you haven't tried it yet, by all means do so, but be advised: it's very good, but also very short ;-)."

Based on the information provided, can you guess what game this review is for? What's it about? What kind of game is it?

Point is, these reviews are completely interchangeable. I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.

In my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.

Anyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?"
622,"bad game it says lost coast but you spawn in the coast this is clickbait i dont recommend, in all seriousness this is a very good short gameplay. honestly better than the entirety of hunt down the freeman"

624,i mean it was kinda good but litte boring
625,Test how good your pc runs with the source engine simulator
626,Corto pero excelente!.
627,"Not really the best experience. Still okay I guess, The Hunter Chopper made the wrong sounds. It made gunship  noises, felt a little bland and WAY too short, yeah I get it. It's a tech demo, but it just doesn't feel complete or polished enough."

It isn't hard, it doesn't expand on the story. 
It was a tech demo to show of hdr, which in this case just means that the game could push your display brightness to 100% so it looks brighter.
Looks ok today.
Died once because i am stupid.
Also a good benchmark if you want to see how many fps your pc can push"
631,this makes me want to throw up i dont know why
632,this is a good game just TOO SHORT
633,"I paid 137$ for this garbage? Steam, I'm done with you."
634,"""there was gaben voice""
10/10"
635,o
636,i found the coast
637,"It's interesting to be able to play through it but generally speaking it's not really worth the time. Half Life is one of the best game series ever (in my opinion) but you're missing out on next to nothing in skipping this. Enjoy the full games in their current states, which is what this would amount to in the end."
638,"original joke
I found the coast"
639,"Short game, play when ur bored of any half life game, i got it with a bundle would not buy alone."
640,Still waiting for found coast
641,best game ever. its so great i finished it in 15 mins. 11/10 better than half life 3.
642,"A canned chapter of the og Half-Life 2, not very long but it's an interesting different take on the 'highway 17' chapter."
643,"Beautiful
Recommended only if included  as a free DLC"
644,Better than Hunt Down The Freeman.
645,the bloom makes my eyes explode 10/10
646,very short and not fun 4/10
647,Honestly really cool listening to developer commentary! Its interesting how they think like that.
648,7.5/10
649,"graphics better than real half life 2
"
650,"Words cannot truly describe the utter marvel and grandeur of this technical masterpiece, from the adrenaline-induced gunplay that keeps you constantly pushing forward, to the gorgeous graphical design and display, this game would be enough on it's own to stand as a solid Valve title. But they didn't stop there, no. The game in addition features a new character simply known as the fisherman, who is so ingeniously well-crafted as a fictional identity, that it creates a whole new depth in intellectual storytelling. The fisherman does a fantastic job at providing social-commentary on racial tensions and gentrification in America, and really has left a personal impact on me ever since I've finished this."
651,"It's a tech demo, I think my 40 minute playtime is from 2 playthroughs. Neat, but non-essential."
652,This is basically just more hl2. Not much else to say. It is free though.
653,better than half life 2
654,very lost coast 8/10
655,"I really enjoyed this little tech demo. If it were included in Half Life 2 It would have probably been one of my favourites.

Rating : 8/10"
656,10/10 best gam ever i like
657,"its not very fun, because its small map only"
658,Idk how I got this but It just show in the notifications. And this is so cool!
659,yes
660,"i found the cost,m not lost anymor, false information, not recomebd,"
661,Not really that interesting.
662,Short but good. Still better than some games I have in my library.
663,Better than fortnite and hunt down the freeman
664,Better than hunt down the freeman.
665,"Screw Half-Life 2 and the Beta, this is where it hits hard"
666,"An Interesting Playable Tech Demo with Developer Commentary which shines the light on the behind the scenes of Half Life 2's Development. Good on Valve for making it free, instead of charging money like developers these days."
667,I SpeedRan this bitch
668,Hold on i gotta go do the dishes brb
669,HDR
670,Nice game for 10-20 minutes!
671,A nice extra level. And the best thing is: there is no Alyx.
672,"Welcome. Welcome, to City 17. You have chosen, or been chosen, to relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers. I thought so much of City 17, that I elected to establish my administration, here, in the citadel, so thoughtfully provided by our benefactors. I am proud to call City 17 my home. And so, whether you are here to stay, or passing through to parts unknown, welcome, to City 17. It's safer here."
673,looks like michigan
674,yes
675,Very Interesting
676,"20 minutes dlc. Way too short to bring anything to the table, waste of time."
677,this game has it all. it's half life 2..... but you get lost on a coast! groundbreaking experience
678,"Wow, I got really surprised of how short this game is. I didn't realize it was just a tech demo.
The short gun play was fun though."
679,game
680,"Nothing but a short story about the map! It is also boring as hell, but it is quite a helpful game."
681,Short and sweet tech demo 7.5
682,"too hard.
0/10."
683,good
684,This is like a tech test/demo. It's very short but fun. I played it a few times and messed around quite a bit.
685,"For a free little side episode, this is alright. I did get stuck a few times but maybe that's because I'm an idiot."
686,a nice inside of scraped ideas and game engine workings.
687,i shat myself while playing this 0/10 whould shart again
688,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast for citizens of the world
Half-Life 2: Found Coast for the combine"
689,"ehh its free with Half Life Two and its a very short (one single map I think) free little piece of Half Life content. So you might as well check it out.

Also I only played for 12 minutes and I beat it (thats how short it is)"
690,
691,Good
692,How the hell do you lose a coast
693,cool tech demo but not much past 45 mins
694,what a half life
695,You kill things and you win the game.
696,fuck helicopters
697,"If you're interested in learning about how the half life 2 developers made the game, then this is for you. And there is a little side mission while you learn."
698,"it takes longer to install than to play. a bit pointless, sorry..."
699,Cool. I love Half life and Sourse engine. It turned out to be real interesting and useful.
700,"A great tech demo, convinced me to swap from the Quake 1/idTech 1 Engine over to the Source Engine.

"
701,"10/10, best game of the year."
702,"Very Accurate
We are in the Lost Coast
100% will buy again"
703,">just a gamee
>thats it"
704,iz nice
705,⠀
706,"A fun, free cut-content map from Half-Life 2. Great voice acting work, fun gameplay. There's not a lot I can say about it."
707,YES
708,short and sweet
709,Best game on steam
710,l
711,It's a tech demo; I have no clue why people assumed that this was a full half-life game for free. It's cool to see some behind the scenes content.
712,EZ Game
713,nah
714,"Brief but good game with a bit of weird, sudden and silly ending."
715,"Nice little extra to Half Life 2, would have been great to see it in the full release."
716,Playable tech demos don't age well
717,nice game
718,"Good experience, nothing more"
719,Add sex
720,Black Mesa prototype
721,Half life is the best life
722,Actually quite interesting to hear about the development process and to get some insight into how far tech has come.
723,"This is such a nice tech demo of sorts. It's not too often you see unfinished/scrapped projects like this released. I'm a sucker for developer commentary, and getting to go through seeing all of the effort put into these games makes me appreciate them just that much more."
724,When the lost coast was found
725,"Really just a product demo- nothing of real interest here, even diehard HL2 completionists will find this to be a pretty mundane level worthy of being cut from the main game."
726,"A great demo level, as a Half Life completionist I played it through and was not disappointed, its really well laid out and I could have seen this in the game itself, the commentary track is interesting and gives great insight into the HL2 game development process."
727,It's more Half-Life 2.
728,"A ""lost"" side quest from Half Life 2. This software is more or less a demo version for the Half-Life 2 games to test if the PC you're playing with is compatible with the software and its game engine. This game is only less than 1 GB and can be finished for a minimum of 30 mins. In short, if its laggy means your device isn't compatible with the Half-Life 2 games. Otherwise, congrats! You can enjoy playing the rest of the Half-Life 2 games."
729,Yeah it's a nice little minor thing.
730,"A half an hour playthrough which includes a unique dedushka NPC(in a way that we won't see him again), ambush with a squad of standard Alliance troopers, two or three headcrabs, one helicopter boss fight and zero reasons for Gordon to actually be on the Lost Coast. Valve didn't even bother to add achievements.

An okay mini-game, but not worth a purchase, unless it's included in Half-Life 2 collection pack."
731,Freeman is nowhere and everywhere.
732,nice game
733,The is just one episode.  It is quickly played.  You can then have a complete adventure in one sitting.
734,yeah it's a pretty good tech demo
735,gordon fishman saves village veri funi guy offers him leech
736,It's not exactly anything special but more HL2 I guess
737,yes good. its good
738,fishermab
739,good
740,It's really just a short technical demo showcasing some of the design challenges and ideas that valve had foe HL2. It's great if you're into that kind of stuff but otherwise you're not missing much.
741,"This is absolutely one of my favorites. It's a first person story based action adventure type of game. If you haven't played Half-Life before, I recommend playing the first addition black mesa. that way you will understand why and how all this destruction, aliens came about.  
As you progress into Half-Life 2 you will  love the graphics as well as new weapons and characters. I'm running an Gigabyte MB with an INTEL  2.93ghz dual core with 16gb ddr3 and a   AMD Radeon R9 390x video card with 8gb of ddr4 and I have all the graphic settings for the game on high and my frame rate is average 148.79 fps. So if this old box of mine can run that smooth, then you're going to really dig this game."
742,I like that developer commentary
743,"This is a very interesting game to experience showing off the HDR capabilities of the source angine with commentary explaining the visual and gameplay decisions and designs.

It’s quite interesting how they think of designing a map which will be used for combat and exploration.

If you get the orange box this already comes with it. This was originally a cut level from half life 2 so you get to see that as well."
744,helkp
745,"Apparently, this is free to play now. Very nice with Remote Play Together. I'm glad they added it, really nice addition for this game."
746,is good
747,yes.
748,"got it on the orange box,  a a playable tech demo.....  its ok  ONLY if it is for free"
749,"Please make more levels like this, so playable, but then I am old!"
750,No life: 2nd in the series spinoff
751,Gabe's voice is in it.
752,good game
753,"I don't have to add anything to this game, it can be said that this is a mini version of hlflaif 2, it's a good game"
754,Half-Life 2: Coast
755,"Just a small demo.

It's free anyways. Get it if you want to find out where the rockets that carry all those damn headcrabs come from."
756,the old chap sounds like a good guy to have some tea and crumpets with
757,Kinda interesting
758,"I almost reached the end. Until, i fell into the water and died, after that the 'English Chap' told me ""You did it lad."" And i became baptized as Fisherman."
759,Plenty of action
760,fisherman made me cream everywhere
761,λ
762,"A heart-wrenching tale about a lonely old fisherman who really just wants to give a mute Physicist a nice steak dinner, but is repeatedly tested when his lover fails to show, until at long last the church bells ring and a trail of Combine Soldiers' corpses precede the silent partner's triumphant return."
763,Interactive entertainment slice of cake for taste of future now. Success!
764,Just an interesting technical showcase of Half-Life 2 environments and graphics circa 2005. Interesting to walk around in but nothing much more than a technical showcase!
765,crowbar 2: lost coast
766,these ~10 minutes of Half Life 2 are better than the entirety of Hunt Down the Freeman
767,"Apparently, this is free to play now. Very nice with Remote Play Together. I'm glad they added it, really nice addition for this game."
768,no
769,"my time was five minutes... add more, fix water"
770,10m game play
771,"Still infinitely better than Hunt Down the Freeman in every imaginable way, even based on longevity."

783,very short
784,Very techy and i love it
785,"Fun little map, playable and fun even today!"
786,"it claims to be a ""lost coast"" but as you can clearly tell by playing the game, you find it. false advertising at it's most sinister."
787,"Nice small tech demo. Fun and INSANELY short, just jump in and hop out."
788,Probably the closest thing we got to the 3rd game... Still fun for a while though.
789,Now this is closer to gta vice city
790,"good morning, gordon 2: lost coast"
791,"It's got Gordon Freeman what else in hell do you even need. JUST PLAY IT!!


Now slowly turn around and handover those awards. Slowly!"
792,"Its yes, but mostly mostly no. I wasn't expecting it to be 13 minutes long."
793,"I can see why this was cut from the highway 17, since it could really break the pacing. Though this was still a fun experience,  and the music in the chapel was just gorgeous."
794,"it's a nice free demo compere to the prequel, i like it! 10/10"
795,"Though short, I'd personally recommend playing through this little expansion at least once, though I personally think that you should play it at some point after the main game's ""Highway 17"" chapter."
796,"How is it a lost coast, People are literally on the island specifically gordan and the combine, I just don't get it. but seriously its still interesting to hear the devs talk about the engine and game design of the map that they made."
797,Good starter to the Half life series
798,i beat this game in 15 minutes
799,well... yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
800,nice game
801,"It's a short game, but good nevertheless, especially on its level design."
802,i found the coast
803,It's a nice but short demo of what's to come in Half-Life 2. 7/10
804,Awesome way to learn about how valve makes their games
805,weryquwetw8e7qweyr237
806,"It's quick and fun! A great small taste of Half Life 2, the greatest game of all time. It's fun to hear the commentary from the developers."
807,"i think its broken, i spawned on the coast."
808,Literally free and amazing
809,for a demo good
810,Short and Sweet
811,"Importante pra quem faz jogo, mais um motivo porque gosto da Valve."
812,Just a fun battle.....
813,it's ok tbh
814,"hold w and a and the beginning to start without the power armor, see how far you get"
815,Fun little tech demo. Beat it in half an hour but hey it came free with half life 2 so I ain't complaining.
816,"Shorter than a hunchback garden gnome named Quasignomo, but still pretty fun."
817,My Beloved Fisherman...
818,fun
819,
820,"longest game i ever played, 10/10"
821,Who lost the coast?
822,GREAT GAME HAHAHAHH IF ONLY DOOZIE WAS A CHUNKER OH WAIT HE IS LEDSIR IS DOG SHIT XDEA
823,"should have been kept in half life 2. its a nice 11 minute experience, and thats if you dont know what to do"
824,"So.... it's basically a Tech Demo.....

It's fine I guess...."
825,"it comes packed in with HL:2, very fun little tech demo, very quick, not too easy, I mean for gods sakes it's free just play it bro"
826,"A short experience displaying the features of Half-Life 2. Though it doesn't tie in with the original story, it's still an amazing game."
827,"It's a tech showcase and should be treated as such. I've beaten it in less than 5 seconds, so that's a neat feature. No reason to play this unless you are into the history of Half-Life, if you want to see HDR just play Counter-Strike: Source and get blinded lmao"
828,Better than all other half-life games
829,I enjoyed listening to the devs talk about how the game is designed
830,"A 20 minute long tech demo for HDR, not worth it for a full game experience but if you're a fan of Half-Life then it is definitely worth picking up for what was a cut segment of Half-Life 2."
831,"Valve's HDR from 2005 rivals the new gen graphics. 

10/10."
832,"beat it in 20 minutes

its ok"
833,"Barely a game, well, scratch that. It's not even a game."
834,"Not the most stellar of Half Life playable stuff and the map quality has really shown its age. 
Had to use the command ""mat_queue_mode 2"" help reduce the stuttering (at least I think it helped? some areas are beyond it). There might be more commands to help but that was enough for me in my playthrough testing.
This HL2 map/game is super short and not the best out there, there is probably better ways to spend your time. 
However, this little map has commentary on it if you want to hear dev stuff from years past.

Also this thing has VR support as with all of the Half Life 2 engine, I did not play it VR and as said before theres probably better things to play as that as well.
Also what I'm implying with better things to play I do mean in the realm of Half Life 2, start looking up community mods and maps to play, people have made some awesome stuff and not all of it is on steam."
835,"this is a ""behind the scenes"" chapter. explaining how the source engine works with live visual demonstrations. play this with developer commentary on"
836,yea it good
837,"The coast isn't lost as its title said, actually. but at least, Gaben gives you his email. I'm satisfied"
838,half life 2 lost coast
839,"fuck you freeman
"
840,It exists.
841,"[h1] Nice Graphics [/h1]

Map design is great. Good Demo"
842,"A great extra episode, it's short but a lot of fun, it's my recommendation for anyone who's played the other Half-Life games and wants something more."
843,nice engine bro
844,A neat little showcase of the Source Engine's power's graphically and a little insight on HL2's development. Good tiny experience.
845,needs more boobs and
846,"its a fun ""game"" and its a cool removed level and i think that this game would be more fun if it has the other cut levels from half life 2"
847,It's a neat little side campaign for HL2. Give it a go.
848,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz now i know my abc's next time won't you sing with me.
849,i found the coast
850,epic
851,better than all of highway 17
852,"the best of the half life franchise, half life 2 deathmatch in second, Source Particle Simulation Benchmark in third place."
853,Yeah
854,Took me 13 min to beat. Graphics look incredible tho
855,"absolutely life changing, the voice acting, the in depth game mechanics, this had been a long and riveting adventure that has completely change how I view the world"
856,This is a really nice addition to Half-Life 2. It is good if you want just a quick taste of Half-Life 2. I honestly like it better than the main game.
857,fun
858,shitty
859,"So slight that it may as well not even exist. I understand that this showed off some new tech when it was released, but now it's largely pointless for anyone who isn't an absolute Half Life completionist."
860,"now do not wait for a minute, you are! youre that scientific infection chub freedman a fisherman am i right?"
861,Nice to know what the devs go through making half life games.
862,"If you love half-life, playing through this with the developer commentary is a must!"
863,"Short but fun tech demo. Was going to be part of Half Life 2, but was taken out."
864,Excellent gameplay and graphics
865,Its a little adventure with you and Gordon Freeman helping out a Fisherman so the Town doesn't get destroyed by the Combine with sending out head crabs to well ruin the Town. Would play it if you don't have anythin' else to do
866,"[h1] Very short demo-ish game [/h1]
A 20-minute HDR showcase. Literally said in the description. It's good."
867,"It's a free 1 or 2 extra maps. It's pretty cool climbing the cliffside, although a bit boring. Not much else too it."
868,Half Life 2: Lost Coast: Episode 2: Alyx
869,I threw the fisherman's cane into the water
870,"perfect game 10/10, but there is some game called half of a life 2 or smth trying to copy it"
871,good
872,"gordon fishman

1000/10"
873,This is a good training for half life 2.
874,"I bit of half life 2 that was scrapped but thanks to valve we are able to experience it, very nice."
875,11/11 would finish again
876,This game is harder than darksouls
877,H
878,"[h1]A fun little tech demo. (No story to spoil)[/h1]
Lost Coast only takes around 30 minutes to finish but it was enjoyable. This is mostly just a demo for Valve to show off HDR but it's always fun to fight the combine. It's cool to listen to the developer commentary which gets into the technical details of the graphical improvements and design decisions, it also has a couple sections where it will show you extra material as examples of the graphical techniques."
879,nice game.
880,we shall feast on the freeman
881,Cool behind the scenes sort of thing.
882,game ROCKS i go to PLAY
883,"I wonder what a speedrun of this might look like, since playing it like a turtle only took me about 15 minutes"
884,"Reminded me of Half Life : Redemption.


short game, more like a lost level.


its alright for a Quickie."
885,"but the coast is right there
monke sad :("
886,Its nice
887,gordon peeman thinks it's just ok :/
888,ok
889,"man catches fish, meets gordon freeman, ""help"", dies, 10/10"
890,"Half-Life 2 Just got super SUPER ...super C-Riosssss
"
891,"17 minutes of playtime, 4 of which were spent in the settings (somehow the time spent magically got reduced to match my actual playtime)

Well, it was fun and it looked amazing, so I think you should play it too!
Just... y'know... don't buy it on its own expecting a full game."
892,life lost
893,fun little cut area from half life 2 that has no real effect on the story. pretty short but what can you expect. plus it is still fun + more half life 2 gameplay
894,"Judging by your hazard suit, I'd say you were apart of what went wrong. Isn't that right? Now if anyone can end this catastrophe its the science team in the lambda complex at the opposite end of base. With the transit system out I couldn't tell you how to get there, but there's a old decommissioned  rail system somewhere through here beyond the silo complex, if you can make it through the rocket test labs you might be able to worm your way through the old tunnels to track down whatever left of the science team you can trust them,  you can trust all of us. Good luck Gordon"
895,"It's lost content, simple as that."
896,"too hard for me, but it was fun, don't buy this game alone, it's included with Half Life 2."
897,Pretty Wholesome
898,"It's a tech demo. It's like 10 minutes long. What is there to say? Well, at least it was a fun tech demo.

900,"To understand why this ""game"" exists play it with commentary. [b]Half Life 2: Lost Coast[/b] is a tech demo from 2005 with insightful commentary about Valve HL2 game series."
901,Gabes voice makes me howrny
902,nice

908,good coast
909,Pretty good tech demo!
910,"17 minutes playetime, totally worth the time for tech showcase."
911,Pickup that can in 4k
912,A legendary game that defined the development of the genre. Thank you for it
913,"I knew it was short but I had no idea it was this short, it took me 11 minutes, I would say its worth playing if you have the Valve/HF bundle and its just been untouched in your library for years like it was for me."
914,Its a short game but its still very cool. would be worth playing if u got nothin else to do lol
915,How is this coast lost?! It's literally right in front of me!
916,fisherman best character in whole HL series
917,actually pretty cool
918,Lost coast was a good little half life 2 adventure.
919,"A good little taste of half life 2 in a short period, great tech demo."
920,Ultimately a demo but still an interesting peak into Half-Life 2 and its development
921,"It is a very good classic game
You should play the whole thing"
922,bu ne aq ya. tek chapter'lık saçma sapan birşey geldi.
923,Great little demo type thing. Some fun little additions like the dev commentaries.
924,The fisherman is the best character in the franchise
925,"It's an alright tech demo, but probably never gonna play it again
"
926,"u know what
not bad"
927,I'm grateful to thy valve for laying thy knowledge upon us. Praise Gaben!
928,"What should I say honestly?
Half life 2 : Lost Coast is a game where Valve showcases the new 2004 Source HDR Technology and you know what?
I'm writing this review from 2021. (For people who is reading this in 2005), And the graphics is toooooooooooooo amazing for a game in 2005. To be honest, This showcase game is one of my best graphics game in my library.
Yes you read it right 2005! Source engine's graphics (and probably physics too) is Wayyy ahead of the time for its release date."
929,Really wish this was in the game. It's a great level.
930,"
great game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
931,just a fun little 5-10 minute little HL2 level with interesting commentary :)
932,half life 3?
933,HL 2: Lost Coast is a fun little tech demo that is good if you want more Half Life content before Episode 3 or whatever sequel Valve have planned. 7 out of 10 leeches. (This is what Half Life: Source should be and could be if Valve ever put some effort into it)
934,bruh
935,"Originally planned as an additional level for the Highway 17 chapter for the 2004 first-person shooter (FPS) game Half-Life 2, Lost Coast is a playable tech demo showcase that introduces High Dynamic Range (HDR) among a few other things.

I got this through the Steam content delivery service as a free download when I bought Half-Life 2.

My full play time is completing this tech demo twice - once with and once without commentary. The commentary is interesting and well rounded for such a short experience.

Short, fun and free what's not to like."
936,"Simply a behind-the-scenes look at how the Half-Life developers created the Source engine. It isn't connected to the mainline Half-Life games at all besides having the same character models. Don't buy this as a standalone game. Even if you got it in the Valve game bundle, there's no reason to play it unless you're a game engine historian."
937,The man was very nice
938,beach
939,"oh ok
BUT ITS STILL FROM HALF LIFE 2 SERIES SO ITS Masterpiece"
940,"Not really necessary to play. Does not hold any story. Very short, one level. Narration is interesting mode."
941,👌
942,"It is just a waste of time, even if its too short
"
943,it was cool
944,good game
945,"More of an engine demonstrator than a game, but it's free with the rest so I will not complain.

The speedrun in 1 minute 21 seconds by some Youtube hero is the best part."

947,"I think this is a good game and an interesting game and if you buy a bundle that this is in (eg. The Orange Box, half life bundles ETC) then you should play it however it is very short it took me about 20 -30 minutes to complete it although it is short because it was made to showcase HDR lighting when it was first introduced"
948,this game is great but too short when i played for the first time i finished it in 18 minutes.
949,"Way better than the Half-Life 2 base game. This is a shorter mission that packs in a lot of action and some incredible visuals.

This is just ideal for what it is and I wish the main game had missions like this rather than the overly long and boring ones. The pacing here is just so much better and you're not stopped by any dull physics puzzles. The level design is great.

The environment here looks way more interesting than any of the ones in the base game too. The water effects are superb and so is the architecture on the buildings.

This was originally intended to be part of the main game but was cut for some reason. Seriously, this would have been the best part of the main campaign had it been left in.

Gameplay: 7.5/10
Graphics: 9/10 (for the time)
Controls: 7.5/10

951,Time played is explaining everything. Ill try to get 100 hours on this. There is so much to explore and play around with!
952,its nice
953,1 issue: its way too long
954,Its a quick HL2 techdemo with cut content
955,Just pure valve game design brilliance.
956,can be done without walk thros or cheating bladerunner1  type half life 2 lost coast to get it. Tips on editors for sdk hlife or grimrock editors etc is ok its like walktros for the village spoils the and paying £64..00 for the game your wasting your money and cheaters are losers .
957,small but good it's a tech demo really well made best of all it comes with half-life 2
958,"For my defiance of not emptying my wallet during the steam summer sale, I have been cursed and banished to this hellish realm of The Lost Coast. Here, I must listen to Lord Gaben's voice whispering me forbidden secrets of game development that I can never use or tell to another soul. My hair has been falling out and I can feel the sprouts of a valve in the back of my head and red paint tumbling down my throat. The echoes of every metallic object has been replaced by the starting intro music of source games. My head twitches every so often and I see the glimpse of thousands of people in another realm, staring at me, but they fade away before I can fully see them. I fear this shall be my fate. Help me."
959,Very good
960,got shot. wouldn't go back. 10/10

967,um very short. nothing to see here
968,"Fascinating info about the source engine at the time and the development process behind Half Life 2.

Informazioni affascinanti riguardo il motore source dell'epoca e il processo di sviluppo di Half Life 2"
969,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast (2005)

From the Wiki:
Lost Coast serves as a technology demonstration, specifically showcasing the high-dynamic-range rendering implemented in the Source engine. The level was designed with a variety of appropriate environments to emphasize these effects. Lost Coast was the first video game developed by Valve to allow developers to explain various elements of design as the player progresses through the level. 

Its basically a tech demo that got cut from the final game. Play as Gordon Freeman as you make your way up the mountain to a monastery to destroy a cannon that fires shells filled with headcrabs into a seaside town. Its short and quick with just a little more Half Life action to keep your fix going.

970,"Learned more about map building and pacing in 20 minute tech demo than through youtube

It's been 17 years Valve, return to your glory days."

972,Not bad show-case.
973,fun tech demo
974,"A great techdemo for the Source engine. Not much gameplay to be had, but that's not the point; rather the point is to show off what the first iteration of the Source engine was capable of. In doing that, this shines marvelously."
975,shit
976,"Short due to its experimentality but interesting introduction to HDR implementation into Source Engine and a commentary accompaniment of the feature's development make an informative playthrough. Though, you should probably skip Lost Coast if you are interested in the series itself rather than how this little game is made and the technologies it uses."

DHalf-Life 2: Lost Coast bietet dir eine kurzweiliges Abenteuer, welches Gordon in neuer Pracht erscheinen lässt."
1003,Approved.
1004,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is some kind of show-case made by Valve to introduce their new High Dynamic Range method of applying light inside the Source Engine. Actually, although this is a very technical subject, the developer's commentary that comes with it, is more than worthwhile listening to. It gives quite some insight into how this mini-level was constructed, and even into how HDR lighting actually works. It's not easy to talk about something as complex as this is an easily understandable manner. Fascinating stuff, and for the die-hard Vavle-fans: you even get Gabe Newell's words at the beginning of the commentary ;-).

After playing it through for a second time recently - after having left it aside for over five years - I felt amazed by how lively most of the graphics and - of course - the lighting still look today - a full nine (!!!) years after this level was published. Especially the little Byzantine church, part of the monastery on top of the cliffs, still feels amazing and oozes atmosphere. Valve did a wonderful job with the lighting inside the church, even letting dimmed light through the stained-glass windows. At the same time, it also made me a bit sad, because, well, how long has it been since we got the latest Half-Life content? Oh well, who knows....

Since this one comes for free in the Orange Box and the Half Life 2-complete package, I guess most of you who played Half-Life 2 at some point, have this in your game collection. If you haven't tried it yet, by all means do so, but be advised: it's very good, but also very short ;-).

Overall rating: 8/10"
1005,why is the coast lost?
1006,"cool tiny game, is fun."
1007,"VERY FUN, I like the shell machine"
1008,:)
1009,.
1010,"This is a demo (with commentary).
10-20mins."
1011,cool game. very short. although this game is just to showcase HDR

1013,my name is Deez
1014,"its a nice little game, i like the half life and i like that when you are bored you can run through the whole game. great short game. good."
1015,By far the best game off the Half-life franchise.
1016,A very good game for the speedrunning  community. I tried speedrunning it too and my best time was 8:26 10/10
1017,Better then some games on steam and this is a really short game
1018,Guys help i cant find the coast
1019,Awesomesauce100/100!
1020,"[h1]Half-Life 2: Lost Coast[/h1]

Not much to say about this FREE Half-Life 2 chapter, that got removed from the main game's HIGHWAY 17 chapter and then reintroduced later here as a standalone chapter.

It is SHORT. You can easily finish this under 30 minutes. The graphical representation in LOST COAST is impressive. It was Valve's HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE technology showcase back in 2005 which was added to the EPISODES later.

LOST COAST isn't deep in story. You start at the bottom of a big monastery up in a hill and yet again, as the one and only incredible GORDON FREEMAN! Then as you climb up that hill, you get to fight a few combine soldiers and the ""boss"" battle consist of a Combine Gunship. 

[h1]All in all, cool and recommended! Give this a shot![/h1]"
1021,Too long
1022,"Hours of fun, I have no idea why this hasn't been in the game awards yet."
1023,
1024,"Despite how short this game is, it's pretty enjoyable. It looks like it was supposed to be continued but never did, which is a shame. Would love to see what else the game was supposed to provide.
Really pleasing to the eye. Very diverse despite the shortness. Well done."
1025,i beat it in like 3 minutes
1026,yes
1027,It's a quality free cut chapter from HL2. Go for it.
1028,"A pathetic way of trying to ignore the fact that they did not finish the whole story and that they are avoiding to make either Episode 3 or Half-Life 3. They talk about HDR and better graphics just to hint at you, but in the end never deliver another part."
1029,"This game saved my life.

I am 32.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

1069,"I thought this game module was really fun.  After battling it out with the Marines in Black Mesa (and later, Black Mesa Definitive), the Combine seem [i]freakier[/i] than I remember.  They seem to come out of nowhere, and even when you think you've got a corner covered, they seem to appear right behind you!

I'm planning to run through HL2 again, once I complete Xen - but if you're craving some classic HL2 action, and especially in a lightweight and resource-friendly package, look no further.  It took me about 30 mins to complete, and that was in my play style which is very cautious around corners - Black Ops style.

Hint: Don't be stingy with the rocket launcher.  Especially when you get to the 'machine...'  You'll thank me.  ;-)

[Note: I don't remember if I got this for free, but I'm not a professional reviewer, so I didn't check anything.  If I did have to pay for it today, I'd spend about $5-7, if for no other reason than to get the creator-commentary.]"

1071,dark souls but with coasts
1072,nice additional level......

1079,I liked the fisherman
1080,"It took me close to 3 hours to finish it, but that's just the way I play games.  I go slow and check everything.  The commentary states, among other things, this was intended as a level in Half-Life 2 but was dropped.  The level is unfinished as you can walk through the silos and many of the buildings outside the main house.  There's even an area where trees and houses are hanging in space,  lol obviously unfinished, but I still recommend it!"

Yes"
1097,what
1098,wha wha wha HDR????? YES YES YES EYS YES YES YES YES YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
1099,"Hearing about graphics development in commentary mode is interesting. This level is on par with the ones in the main games, with details and secrets like you'd expect."
1100,you mean that was it
1101,when the hell did this get in my steam library
1102,A fun few minutes.
1103,"I like headcrab canister launchers, they are good for travel."
1104,"A pretty good example of what the Source Engine is capable of and how it affects gameplay. Perfect for a Source Engine or Half Life fan. Commentary Nodes allow you too hear the developers talk about how the game looks the way it does. 

10/10

A nice example of a Half Life level that teaches what the developers do to each level"
1105,Half of my life but is shorter.
1106,short and sweet
1107,"Really more of a tech demo for some old tech you don't care about.  Still, a fun little map that despite being very short, has some good fun, and some lovely scenery.  Maybe it's more interesting with the commentary; I don't care about commentary."
1108,"10/10
Fisherman MVP!"
1109,"The map is looking nice, they should've kept it in the final game..."
1110,very good game it is
1111,Short game.
1112,"Missing water texture, great game."
1113,Rebels Of The Carribean
1114,"i like this, more pls!"
1115,cool to see old valve tests and how it still holds up in 2021
1116,Good
1117,it's half life 2 but lost coast
1118,"It's just like Half-Life 2, bad."
1119,cool
1120,Cyberpunk sit down.
1121,"Got this so long ago from some sort of amd/nvidia promotion, it's just a short demo showcasing an unused level from halflife 2 don't buy it unless hl2 is a hobby or something like that."
1122,Short but it's ok
1123,what do you expect it's a tech demo
1124,short but gold
1125,"[h1]HALF-LIFE 2: LOST COAST[/h1]
[b]Originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2, Lost Coast is a playable technology showcase that introduces High Dynamic Range lighting to the Source engine

I recommend playing Lost Coast after beating HL2 and the Episodes or just before you start HL2. It's a great 14 minute time killer and an amazing tech demo for the Source Engine.[/b]"
1126,"A short, but great missing level from Half-Life 2. It's interesting to hear the developers talking about it and the map is very pleasant to look at. If you have some time to spare I say this is a nice experience. It's only 20 minutes long after all. It comes with the base game, so there is no reason not to try it."
1127,great fun!!!!
1128,ZZZzzzz
1129,"hey its a fun little demo. graphics are neat, the 5 minutes of combat are get are as good as always. cool setting. nothing to complain about regarding the actual game, but valve should make it free, so people can play it to decide if they will buy hl2 (which you ABSOLUTELY SHOULD)"
1130,my favorite game
1131,"Crap-Life: Clost Boast

no joke it's fun"
1132,"nice little level, but the sky is blinding"
1133,This is a tech demo for the engine improvements implemented between Half-Life 2 and its episodes. Play it to experience the full HL2 experience or skip it as it doesn't offer anything substantial gameplay wise.
1134,"Damn. Where do I start? This game is a masterpiece. Re-Logic has put everything they have into this game and it shows. They have made eight years of content all for free! Almost no other company would do that. This game has so much content. I have beat this game at least thirty times on Mobile, Xbox, and PC and I am sure that my thirty-first time will be as fun as the first. There are countless mods like the Calamity and Thorium mods just in case you do get board. The normal mode is not easy, but it provides players with a challenge, but the expert mode provides players with a greater challenge while forcing the the player to engage with Terraria's mechanics like crafting potions, getting the best armor possible, and learning the boss's attack patterns. If you want to test your skills, this is the mode to play. Everyone should have this game on their steam library, after all it is ten bucks. I have played this by my self and with friends and both are equally as enjoyable. This game is so good the negative reviews are telling you to buy it. If you don't have this game or are not planning on getting it, than you have not seen how good gaming can be.
"
1135,It good
1136,"well its a very short experiance and i like the addition of HDR sells it 
i think it fits in right between highway 17 and sandtraps"
1137,"hi. im enabling comments so you die-hard redditors don't have an excuse.
i think this game sucks, and currently i'm re-playing all of the Half-Life 2 games on hard, without focusing on any of the achievements this time. i don't think anyone can give an honest review of the games because the ""hot cheevos!!!"" can distract so much from the actual game itself. 
anyway im going to copy/paste everything i wrote on discord because i ranted about the game.

My Life Me — Today at 2:44 PM
the cliffside layout makes it seem so ??? when enemies are shooting at you from way up on top, and this applies to the enemies that shoot you from the roof on the top as well. traversing the map is tedious and slowed to the crawl that is the base game's running speed as you're also hugging the wall, because anything extra in terms of speed will fuck you over because the geometry of the mapping is meme-tier. it's a 9-times-outta-10 thing with you falling because you decided to sprint, not due to a lack of dexterity that that even Elder Scrolls games demand from you for cliff-climbing
also it had the classic hl2 chopper fight where you're given infinnie ammo with this boring-ass fucking chopper shit i fucking hate it it's so fucking boring

My Life Me — Today at 2:46 PM
i can't tell if enemies take fall damage

My Life Me — Today at 2:47 PM
that wooden stairway being broken at the start with the combine on it, i don't think that combine took fall damage. then again the combine get hit like paper anyway

My Life Me — Today at 2:48 PM
I was also not impressed with the ""demonstration of HDR"" with how fucking bloomy the ugly sky was from it relying on hdr bloomcum. all the blue of the sky was just made to fuck off lmao
i am reminded of Heide's Tower of Flame from DS2 because it looks better than Lost Cost. i say Lost Cost because i wanted to make a joke about sunken cost and this mini-game with time

My Life Me — Today at 3:24 PM
i hink the small town with the church sucked too
the combine spam when they break into the church sucked, it sucked when there were combine shooting from the roof, it also sucked when that one combine from the balcony was just a sitting duck, and it sucked trying to snipe enemies with the revolver and the zoom-in function
awesome decision to focus on rappelling enemies  because you cut a boat puzzle, which you had to decide on cutting while asking yourselves ""is this fun"", ""how much work should be done to make it fun"" then going BAHHHHHH FUCK IT RAPPELING COMBINE LMAO  even though you still had pussy-footing combine that just stayed up on roofs and balconies
it also doesn't help that they weren't aggressive either, and i was playing that shit on Hard lmao
meanwhile uh, how fun was it to sit in a box of a room that the church is until you figure ""OH, LETS BREAK THIS MAGINE!"" while dealing with lazy waves of enemies, first with the poison headcrabs, then the combine
and that chopper thing, oh go forget about killing it from within the church while trying to cleverly shoot through the now-broken stain glass windows, because that won't be enough to kill it, even if you hit it with 5 rockets

My Life Me — Today at 3:41 PM
the first two combine enemies are also retarded. When you walk up those stairs, I think they just spawn in and walk away and up the stairs. Wow so cool I can easily flank them!! how?? they were RIGHT THERE and there's this fucking boomer fisherman having a conversation with GORDON FREEMAN. yeah ok maybe he mixed up Gordon's name but I can't tell if that's because the Combine are there and he's just having a coded conversation, or if he's a boomer with alzheimers and the Combine shrug it off because of that anyway. I think the latter explanation is really lame and lazy and of bad writing, so I'll just assume that the fisherman is just using mixed up versions of Gordon's name in case anyone was over-hearing.
...
but it's still stupid anyway because uh, who else would be authorized to be on that beach? just saying that IF the fisherman was ALLOWED to be there by the combine, then who else is supposed to be down where he is?

anyway that's my review of the undertale alternate-universe fangame of Underfell"
1138,coast is clear
1139,Spice.
1140,escape haha
1141,yes?
1142,i know its not meant to be reviewed but i come back to this quite a lot. it really shows how many different things you can do in half life two in just one level.
1143,"Probably one of the nicest demos i played, this little demonstration is beatiful. if you got HL2 check it out."
1144,Cool HDR demo
1145,this game made me cry more than 5 times
1146,It kinda the DAV train of hl2.
1147,REALLY GOOD
1148,"It's really short, but quite fun honestly"
1149,this was a cool example of hdr at the time

1151,"Been playing this on and off since it was first released, was supposed to be in HL, but never made in in. good for testing you graphics in HL, and can be a bit challanging the first time"
1152,short but good.
1153,"Hey, you there! Wait a minute now... aren't you? Ah, you are! You're that scientist chap — Freedman, Fishman — am I right? You must be here to take on the Combine. Not sure what one man can do, but... no other reason to visit Saint Olga at a time like this. I'll take you where they made their base — or as far as I can, at any rate.

Here, now, let me just unlock this gate for ya. Got the key ri-right here... There we go! Get along now, laddy. Destroy that gun, and no dawdling. Go on through, lad.

You did it, lad. Come on with me to Saint Olga. We'll celebrate this victory with a feast! I eh... hope you like... leeches. Hey, where you goin'? You're getting fuzzy around the edges! Well, I guess you got other places to be. Uh, nice knowin' ya!"
1154,"It is short but fun, the level design is quite good (specially the 'vertical' part). Moreover, there are interesting comments of the developers and the HDR lightning changes are quite noticeable.

Borealis?? It's definietly lost, i can't see it anywhere
everysingle hl i played it isn't there uHHHHH

mmm leeches yummu"
1158,"Reviewing games I played a long time ago:

A cool tech demo that shows part of the original Half-Life 2 content that was cut from the original game (somewhere around Highway 17 chapters). It focus on HDR tech that was introduced later in Episode 1. It's short, but very fun (also with great vertical level design) as only Half-Life 2 can be. It's like a free bonus for Half-Life fans."
1159,literally just 10 minutes 10 out of fucking 10 holy shit
1160,valve moment
1161,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is pretty short and a bit dull to play, but it does a good job at showcasing how good HDR in the Source engine is. (HDR in the context of photography.) The developer commentary is nice and gives a bit of insight about the development of it. Don't view this as its own game or expansion pack, it's just a neat little tech demo that came with Half-Life 2 as a bonus."
1162,i liked the game!
1163,this game is litterly ez to speedrunnnnnnnnnnnnn
1164,Its alright

1190,You just download it and get on for the nostalgia.
1191,"Since this is just a tech demo, it's a bit rough around the edges, but its still fun to blast through if you've got 15 minutes to spare. Also, definitely play it with the dev commentary on, the process behind the level design and how HDR works is really interesting (at least I think so as an wannabe game developer)."
1192,Probably worth playing through just for the developer commentary.
1193,just demo but a good one
1194,"The Messiah Speaketh Upon Us.
10/10 visual audiobook."
1195,"The Lost Coast is a great opportunity to dig into what makes a Half-Life game great. The two features that make this worth playing are:
 - It's a beautiful location that demonstrates new technology from the time
 - The developer commentary
The developer commentary is seriously underrated. This format is more informative than many others; interviews, art books, retrospectives, etc. This is a great place to discuss the introduction of HDR, from a technological and a design perspective. It also nicely breaks down level design challenges well, creating a successfully engaging scenario in a fairly short period of time.

Play it! You'll probably learn something and you'll definitely have a good time."
1196,neat
1197,"I love Lost Coast, it's the one I will play with I only have a few minutes to kill. I always seem to come back to this little gem"
1198,"Fun little addition to the Half-Life franchise. Played every game in the series 15 years after release and they all still look amazing.

Bonus points to this one. Feels good to listen to GabeN's sexy, sultry voice."

1205,dont even remember playing the game that much but i remember it being fun
1206,worth playing if u got it with half life 2
1207,funny colors
1208,"The best of the half life series, truly the peak of all Valve's creation. Valve Corp must have trapped Marc Laidlaw's soul, cloned it an infinite amount of times and gave them every enhancement drug known to man to write something like this. Why is Gordon here? Where is here? Why is the fisherman the only surviving human? Why are the combine so adamant on shelling some random town? Why haven't they killed the fisherman yet? Surely all these questions will be answered in 6969 when Valve releases Half Life : Fisherman along with Half Life : Lamarr, Dota 6,995 and HDTF 2. 

Seriously tho, I know this is just a demo for a 2004 game but it's still pretty cool. The commentary gives a lot of insight and tips into game design, which I enjoyed as someone interested in pursuing that. 

Also one of the few f-bombs dropped in Valve history, thanks Viktor!"
1209,Most playable Development Test I ever seen

Originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2, Lost Coast is a playable technology showcase that introduces High Dynamic Range lighting to the Source engine."
1220,"Half Life 2: Lost Coast is a section that was originally planned for the Highway 17 level of the main game that was turned into a demo showcasing HDR lighting in the Source engine.

It's still got that same HL2 gameplay so it is pretty fun for what you're given, but is short so only expect a demo and nothing full fledged. Turning on the commentary and learning about what Valve does with their games is what I like the best, it just shows you how exactly Valve incorporates the lighting and is really cool getting to see this sort of insight on games I really enjoy.

Yeah I'd give it a playthrough even if it is 15 minutes (or 30 if you played again with commentary), sure it's only a demo, but has knowledge on some development, gave me 30 more minutes of Half Life 2, and showcased a deleted section of the game, overall pretty awesome in my book."
1221,yes

1229,"This really shouldn't be a game. It's a demo of the Source engine, and not something that has anything to do with Half-Life. Just skip it unless you're an addict of the story. The commentary is kind of neat, but honestly it's just not worth your time. You could read a synopsis in minutes and have experienced the same thing."
1230,"Developer commentary is one of my favorite things to listen to, so I really loved this! I hope valve does this with later games of theirs.

I also wished the area of the town that is getting bombed you can get to by hugging the cliff below it wasn't made of ghost buildings and non exsistant floors because it would've been cool to explore, even if there was nothing to do.

1279,"Really cool little map w/ fun developer commentary! I love reading about the game development process and playing a demo whilst hearing how it was made scratched an itch I didn't know I had. If you're playing without the tour, it's still a solid 15 minutes of cut HL2 content and well worth playing. I wish Valve ended up putting out more stuff like this."
1280,"Only version i can speedrun.

1282,"      It is truly amazing. The peak of modern and, most definitely, future gaming. The generation of tomorrow will look back on this ""video game"" and shed a tear for its beauty will phase them. They will murmur to themselves, wondering how such primitive and barbaric people, as us relative to them, could have made such a wonder. Unlike us, they will not underappreciate, belittle, and trivialize a piece of art like this by calling it a simple video game. They will require the invention of new words to describe this- this- this- excuse me, for my human tongue disallows me to utter any word that could describe this with perfect accuracy. 
    As the Roman Empire was once hailed as the most prestigious nation of them all, and as all kings and queens wanted to unlawfully take some of it's prestige by calling themselves names reminicent of the Emperors, such as ""Kaisar"", which is derived from ""Ceaser"", just like this shall this artistic wonder be remember, with not just other games trying, yet ultimately failing, to trace its steps, but whole galactic, by then, empires being name names like ""Divided Essence the Second: Absent Shore"", and titles for the great emperors being titles such as ""Anglermale"". 
   To Conclede, this is the greatest thing to bestow on the puiny race of humanity, and the fact that our Euclidian brains can even comprehend this is a miracle. The fact that it is given away for no cost is both an act of blasphemy and an act of unprecedented generosity. Play this game NOW. All hail Gabe Newell, the generous. Amen."
1283,"i just completed lost coast without the helicopter spawning XD

aparently the fisherman doesn't spawn if u don't kill the chopper, but the fade still happens."
1284,"That... was the whole game?
"
1285,"Meh,it's not a big deal,you can play if you are bored"
1286,Good game... as long as you don't swim
1287,"It just a test of Source Engine in this game
Good one"
1288,16 mins is probably not enough game time to write a review...but i just couldn't get into it
1289,Recommended due surprise at the end!
1290,"Not much to say here other than if you liked Half Life 2, you'll like this. Basically it's a level that was cut out of the main game, but released instead as its own thing. It's only short - I completed it in 30 minutes or so, though to be honest some players may finish it in less. It's good, smooth Half Life 2 shooter action; what more could you want?

My play-through over on Youtube, for anyone wanting to see a sample of gameplay before buying: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF_MxQmpVsQ"
1291,"Good game, like every Half-Life game out there. It was supposed to be a part of Half-Life 2, but was cut from the game and made a demo for Source's HDR. It's not long, but it's beautiful and enjoyable. It's not a full-game, but it's still worth playing for 30 minutes."
1292,pretty good if your getting it with the orange box or any bundles. completed it in about ten minutes.
1293,"I like this one, just to demonstrate High Dynamic Range. But hopefully there would be a better features in future Source 2 Engine or any similar 3D Engine"
1294,"this is just a tech demo. short and interesting, 
has some good  information for you
"
1295,best game ever
1296,Acceptable.
1297,better than hunt down the freeman 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🍆
1298,its ok
1299,it's a game
1300,I can recommend it!
1301,"Small cut content thing from Half-Life 2, stil possible to beat in just 3 seconds. its okay i guess."
1302,Not hunt down the freeman
1303,Essentially a tech demo that actually provides a lot more than you might expect.
1304,good
1305,Short and simple Half-Life 2 level. Not much else to say.
1306,"an interesting play session
"
1307,pee pee jizz
1308,very in depth storyline.
1309,find the coast
1310,"It's a tech demo of Valve showcasing their inclusion of High Dynamic Range Lighting (HDR) to the Source engine, it's a neat little game which takes 30 minutes at max to experience what it offers fully (including the benchmark, or Video Stress Test) It's fun to play and does look really good, if you get the chance to play it, then do play it, it's a cool little experience."
1311,:D
1312,"it sucks that they removed it, but it makes sense"
1313,"Its an okay game and im glad its free (when you purcahse half life 2) HOWEVER it should only be played after hl2 due to it only being an extra, and giving some spoilers."
1314,a beautiful Half-Life experience!
1315,I actually haven't played this game
1316,at lwest now the fisherman has a model
1317,This game is so bad it doesn't even have good
1318,why the fuck do i have 10 hours on a 10 minute tech demo
1319,"Hi, this is Gabe Newell."
1320,why can't I poop
1321,its cool
1322,Nice graphics
1323,this can only be bought if you bought one of the half life episodes.
1324,Shiny complimentary tech demo be shiny complimentary tech demo. Shame about the underwater being bugged out. Would be nice to see underwater HDR since they're tooting the horn so much. ;p
1325,Kinda lame but idk what else to expect from it.
1326,"I remember being bitter and feeling left out that I couldn't run this game 15 years ago. I shouldn't have felt that way now that I've played it. Cool demo, but nothing more than that."
1327,if you are looking for a game you will play 20 mins max this is the game for you
1328,"Really Short, Around 15 min of gameplay, but fun"
1329,tis good
1330,cool cut content
1331,water
1332,Basically a 20-min-flex of reflections that must've been incredible back then. Very cool addition for fans. The closest to episode 3 we're ever gonna get.
1333,fisherman
1334,It is a short DLC for a good game such as Half Life 2 but I enjoyed it.
1335,nice little tecdemo
1336,"It's really just a map from Half-Life 2 that didn't make it into the final game; so if you like Half-Life 2's gameplay, you'll like this. It also has Developer Commentary mode, which Half-Life 2 doesn't have; and that adds some insight into Valve's development process for the Half-Life 2, as well as for the new lighting system that this is a demo for. Overall, a fun little tech demo, but don't expect anything much."
1337,10/10 would help a fisherman defeat the combine again.
1338,"Although this is not a complete episode or segment, it does play well as a sort of test piece for both player graphics as well as the entire rendering work. The in game running commentary can be interesting for those who appreciate the nuts & bolts end of it as well as game design elements. The mission itself isn't terribly difficult, and I believe it was intended as a HL2 chapter which got cut. Freeman's mission here is to take out a headcrab launch site which has been placed, with some cruel irony I think, in a small Russian Orthodox church on a bluff overlooking the town. Visual effects to look for particularly are the motion of the water and light reflections off the small waves. It should play in about 10 or 15 minutes, I think, longer of course if you stop to listen to all the commentary.  A very nice short diversion."
1339,A very good 15 minute tech demo showcasing the new HDR effect. it's a fun and short tech demo and it was also supposed to be in the 'Highway 17' chapter of Half Life 2. 7/10.
1340,Truly next gen technology.
1341,"Kor : 여기 나오는 절벽위에 교회 그리고 그 주변에 있는 작은 마을은 원래 하프라이프2 에서 ""17번 고속도로""라는 챕터에 등장할 예정이었으나 취소되었다. 이 게임은 정식판은 아니고 그냥 하프라이프2 에피소드1,2의 소스엔진 신기술 
인 ""HDR""이라는 기술을 시현하기 위한 작품으로 쉽게 말해서 데모 버전, 체험판 정도로 생각하면된다. 

그래서 이야기도 매우 작다. (챕터가 하나) 


 최종목적인 헤드크랩 로켓 발사기를 부시러 교회로 가야하는데,
교회안에 들어가면 신비한 브금이 들려온다. 무섭다고 해야되나 아무튼 말로 표현하기 힘든 부분이다.


Eng : From here, the church on the top and the small town around it were originally scheduled to appear in the chapter called ""Highway 17"" in Half Life 2, but if cancelled. This game is not a full version, it is just a new source engine technology for Half Life 2 Episodes 1 and 2
It is a work for demonstrating a technology called ""HDR"", and in simple terms, you can think of a demo version or a trial version.

So the story is also very small. (One chapter)


 The final purpose, the head crab rocket launcher, has to go to the Bushrer church.
When it comes to the contents of the church, you can hear a mysterious beegeum. It should be said that it is scary, but it is difficult to express in words anyway."
1342,"I only like it because it's a part of Half-Life story, so it's really too short, but not bad... not bad."
1343,tech demo
1344,"While its a short tech-demo, its quite fun. One could learn quite a bit about level design from its more than contained experience."
1345,This is my favourite of all the Half-Life games. I love the bleak and lonely atmosphere in this one.
1346,fisherman is the only good part but there was no feast :(
1347,the coast isnt lost at all i found it

1351,"Not much to say since its just a simple tech demo.
Only took me 15 minutes to beat it(only because I'm stupid) and its literally just a tech demo.
if you need to get and play everything half life, go for it but don't expect it to be the best thing ever.
Besides that its pretty neat!"
1352,half life 2 seagull edition
1353,A good introduction to HDR
1354,"Half life more like Half an hour 
still pretty fun though"
1355,This game is truly the half life 3 of the half life series.

1357,Short and sweet

1359,"This game is important to my wellbeing and mental health. Everyone who confronts me says ""waweeg why don't you eat anymore, why don't you acknowledge our existences as proper respectable fucking people. You are tearing apart your friendships with your horrible obsession with Half-life 2 lost coast. We miss you, come back to us and forget this shitty steam game. We loved you.""  Jokes on them i'm no longer myself, i believe AND have transformed myself in the mental image of the fisherman from Half-life 2 lost coast and i am proud of it. I am fisherman, i am proud. They will all feel regret when i march down town with my harpoon declaring that the combine of old st Olga will be defeated. They will know my name."
1360,"(My logged hours on this game are significantly less than reality, given that Steam does not recognise MMod as a first party modification)."
1361,"So now that I've reviewed every Half-Life game (Aside from Alyx) I figure I'd review this one as well, although this won't be a typical review as this is essentially a Tech demo and there isn't much to really go over here, so I'll just list the notable things from it, much like my Blue Shift review.



1. This game is a cut part of the HL2 Campaign, it was intended to be set in between the Highway 17 and Sandtraps chapters but was cut from the final version, probably because they felt the game would be too long, although honestly if they really thought that, they could've severely trimmed Highway 17 up.

2. The ""Game"" itself is about 4 to 5 minutes long, which you may think is short but again this merely a tech demo so it's fine.


3. The level itself has you talking to a fisherman who tells about the Combine hideout above on these mountains and so you go up there after he unlocks the gate for you and you fight Combine up the mountain, in a building situated at the top that's a combine base of sorts and then fight a helicopter and then you go down afterwards a job well Done. It's pretty short and sweet and is honestly fun to blast through

4. You start with The Crowbar, Gravity Gun, 9MM Pistol, 357. Magnum, Shotgun, RPG and the Crossbow. Likely due to the fact that you would have had these weapons given it was gonna take place in between Highway 17 and Sandtraps, although oddly enough you don't start with an SMG, which is odd as Gordon would have collected that at this point, same with the AR2 although you get an AR2 from the Combine anyway.


5. This was the first Valve game to use High Dynamic Range Lighting aka HDR, and it honestly looks really good, Lost Coast looks a ton better than Half-Life 2 does which is nice.


6. This game would also mark the introduction of the Developer Commentary feature which has since become a staple in every Valve game afterwards, and it's a fun little way to learn the ins and outs that went into making these games.




So overall that's really there is to say about Lost Coast as it's just a Tech Demo that was released for Free to those who owned Half-Life 2, honestly for a neat little bonus that comes for free with Half-Life 2 as well as from a historical perspective, it's not bad at all. It's pretty fun to mess around with although don't expect anything huge or earth shattering as it's pretty basic given that it's just a tech demo made from a cut part of the game. Honestly I think it's worth checking out if you ever bought Half-life 2 as it would be pretty entertaining, heck maybe it would make for something fun to speedrun, but yeah overall: a pretty fun little bonus that comes with Half-life 2."
1362,Just a physics engine demonstration. The tour was dotted with optional dialogue from the creators. It was kinda cool to hear how the developers went about creating different aspects of the game especially some of the innovative stuff that has become the bread and butter of the modern gaming landscape.
1363,havent played this game in 1 year lmao
1364,"Pioneering for its time, basically a short tech demo."
1365,YES!! My PC is ready for the year 2005!!
1366,It's a Half-Life level. Yes.
1367,yes
1368,"idk it's short and it felt like a waste of time. Sure it's free, but I didn't really get much out of it"
1369,-_-
1370,"A delightful insight into a small stage that could've been.
The design and story progression within this level is nice and could've been a memorable key sideplot had it been included in the base game, Half-Life 2.
As the level is designed in this cut content game I can sadly see no way it would've fit into the base game without major rework, and it's likely this reason that got it removed from the game. Nevertheless if you enjoy all the other Half-Life games and are looking for more HL content, then this little Lost Coast is a comfortable pick for you."
1371,"You don't need to play it, there's nothing storywise, just a developer commentary"
1372,"great game, as all of half life games are."
1373,"Its free, just play it"
1374,"Thank you Valve, very cool!"
1375,umm i have a a werid thing happeing that made me ast all my money
1376,This is actually a very good little game this was cut content that was going to be in the highway 17 chapter in half-life two but it got cut and then go turned into this game its actually really pretty good I highly recommend it.
1377,"Yeah it's short and there really isn't much to it, but it's very intriguing to learn about the process of making one of the greatest game series."
1378,yes
1379,"You fight combine for 2 seconds and thats it...
Its ok I guess."
1380,jeu pour flex avec leur moteur
1381,sweet!
1382,"It's pretty decent. That is all
"
1383,Cool Source Engine 1.0 tech demo made in using HL assets.
1384,"Lost Coast rocks actually, a fun and brief jaunt through a nice little locale, and even though it's merely a tech demo or whatever, honestly I still think it's worth experiencing if you're going through all of Half-Life, as it's a pretty fascinating and packed little trip."
1385,Sorry about the past comment. I did not know the game was a tech demo. I did some research and it said it was just an addon onto one of the chapters. Thank your# cluxhd for letting me know.
1386,"Score: 8/10 - GREAT
This level is included for free with a purchase of Half-Life 2. I remember when I first played Lost Coast many years ago, I was extremely impressed with the visual upgrade Lost Coast had over vanilla Half-Life 2. The action was also fun and appropriately difficult. If you want to try a level with impressive visuals and architecture, give this an hour.
"
1387,"The only bad thing is how short it is, because Half Life it's always fun in every corner. A must for fans."
1388,You Win
1389,Lost Coast is essentially a short tech demo for Half-Life 2 and is worth a playthrough for Half-Life fans.
1390,Half-Life 2:Lost in my library
1391,Textures are nicer
1392,good demo
1393,it sure is a 2005 tech demo
1394,this good-me 2020
1395,Fun display of High Dynamic Range
1396,"this is one of the best games in the half-life game series. its short and sweet, because of that it has a lot of replay value. the only bad thing about it is that all of the enemies are combine. over all id recommend this game. 95/100"
1397,what is this? i mean it is a good hl game dont get me wrong but its so short. wtf
1398,"Fun level, good graphics, and interesting commentary.  About 20 minutes of gameplay."
1399,"short sweat and straight to the point, i like it despite the fact that i don't like half life 2 this is good"
1400,"Sure, the game is very short, but it's free and the dev commentary is really interesting. Make sure you have the commentary on, it's nothing without it. Recommend if you have even a slight interest in video game design/physics."
1401,This game is wayyyy better than original HL2
1402,Love it
1403,"Sure, it's just a tech demo, but it looks cool and features some interesting commentary. If you're a fan of the series, it's definitely worth playing at least once. (And you probably are a fan anyway if you bought the games that made this appear in your library.)"
1404,I love this game
1405,"This is a very good short-procedure game, and it was announced for introduces the Techs that used in the Source engine."
1406,I've put 4 hours in a tech demo
1407,Yes
1408,"What a game, it makes me cry every single time I come back to it. This definitely earns my Labour of Love nomination for the 2020 Steam Awards."
1409,"Fun , short , and free"
1410,"** Game Finished **

It's good and not to easy.

"
1411,"This is just a tech demo for HDR, but still fun to play through."
1412,Intresting dev commentary. It only takes 15-20 minutes of your time and is well worth a listen if you want to know a bit more about the various technologies used in game development.
1413,this is a fun little game for the fans of half life
1414,good short thing that is something
1415,the best thing about it is the face of the only (fully) human npc
1416,THIS IS 20 MIN OF PURE NUTS TO BUTTTS ACTION
1417,Interesting tech demo and educational commentary from Gaben and the gang.
1418,"Not quite sure why they made a 12 minute level in Scotland, but it was fine."
1419,nice...
1420,"I'm not mad, I'm disappointed."
1421,I'm sorry but what did I just experience
1422,Short but worth (to play)
1423,"Useless.
P.S. In Italy we don't eat leeches."
1424,I thought the soundtrack dark interval was recorded in 2007........
1425,YOUR'E FOND OF ME LOBSTER AIN'T YE!???
1426,This was my introduction to Half life 2. Gameplay is short and fun
1427,"HDR showcase, at that time was pretty interesting"
1428,it took me 21 minutes to beat this. all this game is is some information of how valve was improving their graphic system back in 2005. i reconmend playing it if you are interested in the development of half life 2 and 1.
1429,This DLC is about 30 mins long it's just killing at least about 35 guy's and a chopper boss and thats it and a couple black headcrabs.
1430,Oh god! Gg nice.
1431,I hope you like leeches!
1432,I mean.. it's a tech demo.
1433,"Short and sweet, but very interesting if you're looking for some insight as to how games are visually polished. Considering the graphics of Half Life 2 still hold up to the present day, its fun to know how they did it (specifically in lighting, in the case of this game) to optimize it. You'll spend a good half hour at best playing it, but its worth the interesting commentary."
1434,"Its one level, just be aware of that, but it is fun."
1435,cool
1436,good
1437,It's kind of weird but it's included when buying half life 2
1438,A tech demo that is actually fun
1439,"I think was a good little starter to Half-Life 2. I liked the area, and kind of wanted it to continue on... that is exactly what it was for and it did its job well."
1440,gud developer commentary
1441,Short and sweet and enjoyable
1442,Took me straight back to the old days but with amazing graphics for its time. Great little demo for anyone who loved the Half Life franchise.
1443,"Short game but hearing gaben speak is always relaxing 10/10
"
1444,"""there was gaben voice""
10/10"
1445,"good, 15 minutes to finish(no achievements)"
1446,Try It Its Basicly Half Life 2: Uplink
1447,"Short fun excursion to St Olga's Lost Coast to silence the B.F.G. Don't forget to check out the STRANGE ""behind the scenes"" going's on, just across the Bay.... but keep out of the water or the fishes will get you..."
1448,short n sweet
1449,Just some stuff that they cut from Half Life 2 but wanted to put out anyway.
1450,the game is so short but I still like it I hope they make half-life 3
1451,absolute masterpiece. completely redefined the series.
1452,"Oh boy is this game quite unfair, very beutiful scenery, and I haven't beaten it.  I'd say if you're a fan of Half-Life, play it, if you aren't then don't.  I'm mainly playing for the story."
1453,Its just 1/64 of half life 2. But its free.
1454,pog
1455,short but sweet
1456,Engaging mix of FPS and puzzles.
1457,"this game makes me fuzzy around the edges
i'm leaving this as a negative review until valve fucking fixes TF2"
1458,A really short but still fun behind the scenes game about Half Life 2.
1459,Fun little expansion. Maybe a little too short. It's free so what's to complain.
1460,this game is super fun its Half-Life 2 but its a DLC to it that comes when you buy the full game.
1461,Internet connection
1462,"a short test for the next gen games that are released rn.

10/10 for the nostalgia, give it a try, its free, its half life.

Graphics are alright, it doesnt even last 2 hours."
1463,"takes my mind off taking pics of spiderman not good, but otherwise GREAT GAME"
1464,Cool tech demo
1465,"Pretty short, but very fun, packed with action, you wake up on the coast with some old fisherman, you go up a hill, and boom, fight,   good game,  i recommend if you just want to mess around with commands or to just have a bit of fun for about 10/30 minutes."
1466,idk what the point of this game is but its a nice experience i guess
1467,"This was a cool experience to kind of see where technology was back in 2005 and where it was going. It is very short but its not there for the gameplay its there for the experience and to showcase just what valve was working on back then. Looking at today's games in 2020 with VR and all that, it doesn't look like much but back then it was a big deal in the gaming industry

9/10"
1468,Cool bts type level. Try it if you're a hl fan
1469,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a demo to showcase the abilities of the Source engine, mainly visual improvements.
A nice demo, and actually pretty fun to play."
1470,Cool
1471,what
1472,e
1473,nice short mission
1474,half life
1475,this was more fun then hunt down the freeman portal stories mel and everything else even though its a 15 minute tech demo it felt like i was playing water hazard
1476,"easy, quick, fun"
1477,"bad grafic and 
Full of shit I've never seen such a shitty game yet!"
1478,"Not essential to the Lore by any means, or particularly challenging, but an interesting look into development challenges and focuses. If you are like me and playing this 15 years after the fact, its a pretty cool glimpse into development challenges of over  a decade ago. Its free, why not give it a shot?"
1479,better than hunt down the freeman
1480,"yeah you are, you're that scientist chap uh freeman am i right"
1481,more half life is always goodd

1484,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

1501,"Ah, Half Life 2: Lost Coast. The lost episode of the group of 2. This is a fun little ditty that you can play over and over, and it isn't getting old any time soon. It's about 15 minutes long, but I can still have a hell of a lot more fun than HTDF. Also, obligatory ""the next thing we'll be working on after the Orange Box is episode 3"" joke."
1502,its half life u physically and mentally cant say anything bad about it
1503,"This game was created as a test for your PC and Polygon for testing new technologies of that time in 2005!
There was a time when we had already passed Half-Life 2, but we were waiting for something new and believed in it! Of course, there was no HL2E1 and HL2E2 and much more!

So open your eyes, Mr. Freeman, and see this wonderful little island of your life story!

From the first seconds we recognize the thin hand of brilliant authors and developers from Valve! Here you can play with light, physics, and, of course, any puzzles and artificial intelligence technologies in the NPC!
All this literally fills this little gameplay with the spirit that excites our blood!

This game takes 30 minutes of your time, but it stays in your heart for years to come!

10/10 Dr. Freeman's moments for our eyes and forever in our Hearts!"

1506,Missed opportunity.
1507,"What Half-Life 2 short of is the training level and Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is just a perfect fit for this purpose.  This short level features almost anything you need to know about Half-Life 2, in terms of enemy behaviours, new HEV suit functions, platforming, puzzles, and almost complete arsenal at your disposal. New players can experience the Source Engine and new gameplay elements which are way different than Half-Life One. Existing players can treat it as a ""Hazard Course"" level to hone their combat skills."

1510,pretty good
1511,shorter than my pp
1512,"i played for more than 10 hours,but steam decided to set it to 21 minutes,Oh well,the game is great"
1513,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a demo to showcase the abilities of the Source engine, mainly about HDR and other visiual improvements.

A nice demo, and actually pretty fun to play."
1514,Nice little tech demo for HL2
1515,"[h1]it‘s little more than a demo for a grafical update that is barely noticeable, but at least it’s free.[/h1]

it’s a single level that is not at all connected to the hl story arc, and depending on which difficulty you choose, it will take about 20 to 30 minutes maximum to beat it. all you have to do is climb a small cliffside and survive a gunfight against the combine in a chapel at its top before shooting down a chopper and finally returning back to the starting point. it’s absolutely unnecessary and unspectacular, but hey, it’s more half-life for zero bucks, and there is never anything wrong with that.

HALF-LIFE 2: LOST COAST
Genre: First-Person-Shooter
Release: Q4 2005

( ) 0/8 Simply one of the worst games ever made. Don't waste any money on this.
( ) 1/8 Bad. Seriously flawed with barely any redeeming qualities. Worth a couple of Cents at best, if at all.
( ) 2/8 Sub-par. Only for hardcore-fans of respective genre / series. Don't pay more than 5 bucks.
( ) 3/8 Meh-diocre. It‘s okay. Don't pay more than 10 bucks.
(X) 4/8 Decent, but not for everybody. Don't pay more than 15 bucks.
( ) 5/8 Good game, Must-play for genre- / series-fans. Worth 20 to 25 bucks max, if you are not a fan.
( ) 6/8 Great game, universal recommendation. 30 bucks would be a steal for this.
( ) 7/8 Outstanding game, a milestone of it‘s respective genre. Definitely worth its full prize.
( ) 8/8 Simply one of the best games ever made. Get this, the prize doesn't matter."
1516,"If you want to spend your money just to go up a mountain, find a church and then go down ... and sadly realize that this is the only game. Go for it. There's nothing more. 

I really would love a refund on this one."
1517,:D
1518,yeah its good
1519,I've learnt a lot about game development through this walkthrough. I highly recommend anyone who is interested to learn about game development to play this game.
1520,"Nice demo for testing the HDR capabilities of the Source engine, although I'm not a big fan of it since it makes every yellow surface eye burning obstacle."
1521,"half life but on beach, rip off of sonic 06"
1522,Its just More Half Life
1523,"Worth a playthrough but seriously, most of my time spent was stuck in a small locked room.  Once I finally figured it out, it just felt strange.  I ran out the door I came in and killed a bunch of guys to then run back into that small room to then go to the next area.  Frustrating."
1524,"A beautiful tech demo. a shame it never made it into the actual game. I love this setting and would love to explore ST. OLGA in person. perhaps SOURCE 3 will demo a second lost coast? for such a short demo, it felt very half life in polish and style, and would easily fit in as a sub-plot or additional DLC. Great ""game"" somtimes i load this up and just listen to the sounds for nostalgia....PLAY IT!"
1525,"The game is like what it says it is... I played it and after 0.2 hours i felt lost on the coast and quit the game. I might give it another try tho, i will give it a + rep :)"
1526,gay
1527,Really good short demo game of Valve's creativity and technical graphics.
1528,pretty decent demo
1529,"Short, fun, and enjoyable tech demo.  Worth an hour of your time to enjoy this experience!"
1530,What a awesome little game love going all over and around places your not so-posed to go
1531,if you liked portal this is even more fun
1532,My friend gifted me half life 2 i was excited to play it ive always wanted half life Im happy i finally got it after a while :D
1533,For the most part a really fine addition to the Half Life Series. Fizzels out at the end leaving you will a questions as to what happened. Give me a boat to get to the other side and continue the game in the refinery.
1534,I really recommend this game. The only think i didn't like was its too hard
1535,"Not a bad little addition to, and showcase for, the Half-Life series, and certainly worth the ~15 minutes it takes to play it."
1536,"half life 2 lost coast is unequivocally the best half life games in the series. the reason for this is its a painful experience that only lasts 15 minutes

i hate all half life games"
1537,half life 2 lost coast is 100% without a doubt the best game in the series due to the fact that you don't need to play it at all and even if you do its like 15 minutes!
1538,lost
1539,"[i]Lost Coast[/i] takes place on the shores of a fishing village called St. Olga. The Combine have installed a parasite launcher in the monastery up on the cliff, and the cantankerous fisherman who greets you wants it turned off. That’s a reasonable enough request – there’s headcrabs in those rockets, and the town across the pretty water looks proper nice and idyllic.

Actually, everything looks proper nice and idyllic in [i]Lost Coast[/i]. Valve created the level to serve as a tech demo for the Source engine’s gorgeous High Dynamic Range lighting and showcase some new gameplay ideas. Apparently the monastery was cut from [i]Half-Life 2’s[/i] coast section, which makes sense although where it would’ve slotted in is anyone’s guess.

The verticality of the level’s design is its biggest strength, gameplay-wise. After [i]Half-Life 2[/i], Valve’s skill at creating arenas for the player to fight the Combine had clearly grown, and [i]Lost Coast[/i] is the first taste of that. You’ll navigate the treacherous cliff-side in a clear ode to the original game’s Surface Tension chapter, dealing with Combine soldiers firing at you from above and below. It’s a modestly rewarding piece of combat.

Once you’ve scaled the cliff you’ll arrive at the monastery, or what’s left of it. The small courtyard at the top is one of Valve’s prettiest bits of level design. The side streets and tiny alleys are exquisitely made. It’s all very evocative, in that crisp blue light so redolent of chilly coastal towns.

And then there’s the monastery itself, where the HDR vividly brings to life the strong, rich colours adorning the walls and windows. The tiles are cracked, with grass and weeds growing between them, and although the Combine have brutally imposed their oppressive futuristic design on the building, its beauty cannot be effaced.

Honestly, the monastery is worth the trip alone.

I remember when [i]Lost Coast[/i] was released. There was a sense in 2005 that we were about to embark on a post-[i]Half-Life 2[/i] era of non-stop content from Valve, from bite-sized levels like this to fully-fledged episodes. That’s not how things turned out, but that’s okay. Developers’ interests change, their priorities shift, and the industry moves forward.

Maybe more [i]Half-Life 2[/i] is not what we needed.

But it was fun – not to mention exciting – whilst that feeling lasted. And it looked proper nice, too. Still does.

Oh, and if that's not enough, [i]Lost Coast[/i] gave us Kelly Bailey's hauntingly beautiful [i]Dark Interval[/i] track, which serves as an excellent ambient accompaniment to the monastery. You can't ask for more than that, so don't even try."
1540,"A neat little tech demo. It's exactly what it says it is, and it comes free with HL2."
1541,I do recommend the to players. but its a short game.
1542,documentry
1543,SHIT
1544,This DLC is okay -- not different from the main game. Just a new area. Easy challenge. Took me about 15-20 minutes.
1545,this game was simply short and sweet really had a nice atmosphere of the developer commentary while still being able to play the game and enjoy the scenery and killing combines and the helicopter at the end also the video rendering thing was neat
1546,It's good and quick.
1547,"This should really be called Half Live 2: Lost Coast DEMO.  There was less content here than in most demo products I've seen.  It took longer to download than to play.  I expected it to be short, but I was unprepared for how short this is.
"
1548,Lost
1549,i'm pretty sure there is somewhere hidden door that leads to half life 3 in this game...
1550,i left my wife for the fisherman
1551,A cute little game that's reminiscent of Gmod.
1552,"Even though it's very short, I have enjoyed it. It was fun exploring around. I tried to get on the other side of the water but i got eaten alive by piranhas. It was a nice experience really, go ahead and play it."

1556,"Cool insight on the work that goes into making these games look so good, especially for when it came out."
1557,There are worse ways to spend 30 minutes.
1558,"best entry in the half life series (and thats saying something because the games are all garbage), but not by much, its a physics showcase which i guess is pretty cool, but the level design is very confusing and you cant progress past the first area if the stair gets blwon up before you climb up it in time, resulting in you having to cheat and use noclip, and if you have to cheat to play a game normally its a pretty bad game. thats why tf2 flopped"
1559,"It might be 20 minutes long, but I did have fun for the entire 20 minutes. It's more Half-Life 2 and that's always nice! You fight through a pretty interesting area, take down a group of enemies and even go up against a Helicopter boss. A fun distraction!"

- Developer Commentary

[u][b]Cons:[/b][/u]
- Pretty short, can be finished in 30 minutes or less (but it's just a demo so it's not a problem)

I would have loved to see this in the base game. It's pretty short so you should play it through at least once."

1583,A solid play.
1584,this is a very short game and unfinished but it comes with orange box and its cool to see the best of the source engine
1585,It's fun
1586,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is some kind of show-case made by Valve to introduce their new High Dynamic Range method of applying light inside the Source Engine. Actually, although this is a very technical subject, the developer's commentary that comes with it, is more than worthwhile listening to. It gives quite some insight into how this mini-level was constructed, and even into how HDR lighting actually works. It's not easy to talk about something as complex as this is an easily understandable manner. Fascinating stuff, and for the die-hard Vavle-fans: you even get Gabe Newell's words at the beginning of the commentary ;-).

After playing it through for a second time recently - after having left it aside for over five years - I felt amazed by how lively most of the graphics and - of course - the lighting still look today - a full nine (!!!) years after this level was published. Especially the little Byzantine church, part of the monastery on top of the cliffs, still feels amazing and oozes atmosphere. Valve did a wonderful job with the lighting inside the church, even letting dimmed light through the stained-glass windows. At the same time, it also made me a bit sad, because, well, how long has it been since we got the latest Half-Life content? Oh well, who knows....

Since this one comes for free in the Orange Box and the Half Life 2-complete package, I guess most of you who played Half-Life 2 at some point, have this in your game collection. If you haven't tried it yet, by all means do so, but be advised: it's very good, but also very short ;-).

Overall rating: 8/10

+ its free anyways lol"
1589,I found the coast
1590,Half Life Lost Coast is more fun Half Life Gameplay. It's just one level that takes about 20 minutes to beat and is fairly easy. It doesn't really add anything to the story and in all honestly feels like a demo to Half Life more than an expansion.
1591,Just a quick tech demo.
1592,"[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review [/h1]

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a game developed and published by Valve

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good action game and to play in short bursts

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

[b] A Neat Level, If A Bit Pointless [/b]

This is an extra level for [b] Half-Life 2 [/b] that was cut from development, and it is a bit obvious why. Unlike many of the levels in the final version of the game, this level is very, very short and pretty minor in terms of the events that occur. All you do is basically shut down one launcher that the Combine are using, fight some soldiers, and fight a helicopter. This pretty much already happens multiple times in the campaign in one form or another, so it makes sense that this was removed. Sure, it was fun, but it doesn't add much to the overall experience. I can still [b] Recommend [/b] it, it shows some of the stuff that Valve believed wasn't worth putting in the finished game.

https://store.steampowered.com/curator/37542043-ADHD-Reviews/"
1603,great
1604,Finished in in under half an hour. It's pretty disappointing.
1605,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a fun 10-15 minute level up to the standards of Half-Life 2. It was created to be more of a Tech Demo for Valve's HDR technology back in 2005 rather than a standalone DLC like the episodes. It also features a developer commentary, which gives inside to the way Valve created it."
1606,"Lost Coast is, in my opinion, the most well rounded Half-Life experience available to PC gamers in 2020. This is such a tight 20-30 minute play-through. There's none of the clunkyness or the too-long sections of HL2, just pure fun through and through. Lost Coast is mostly devoid of story elements, but for such a short run-time, that isn't missed. The setting is one of the prettiest in the franchise, and the map offers a great deal of fun altercations and combine attacks that make you strategize a little and think on your toes, too. The optional dev commentary elevates the whole experience, and makes me appreciate the map design and visual artistry in all the HL2 games a bunch more. 10/10"
1607,"Very cool, and interesting! Although I can't have graphics higher than the low setting, most things look very good. (If I try to set graphics higher, my game crashes. I have a pretty bad PC.)
I really recommend this!"
1608,A neat tech demo that was informative and quickly over.
1609,A good 15 minute game.
1610,"If you are looking for a full blown half life experience then this is not the way. I have bought this game with the orange box and it's action full 15 minute adventure showing what a source engine can do.

Considering what this should be, it's 10/10
Godo buy on a sale and enjoy it for what it is."
1611,It's half life
1612,"Grew Up With The Half Life Series BUT THIS GAME MADE ME HATE IT WHY THE FUCK WOULD ANYONE WANT A GAME THAT SPOILS HALF LIFE 2 CHAPTER 2 BRUH WHY DID I SPEND HALF A GODDAMN HOUR ON THIS BULL SHIT. THIS GAME HATES ME AND I HATE IT I KILLED EVERYTHING AND WHY DID VALVE PICK UP AND MAKE SUCH A GODAMN STUPID ASS GAME. thank you for reading this, and have a good day you litte shit."
1613,Nice dev showcase
1614,It's actually pretty interesting if you like the behind the scenes stuff for Half-Life and future Valve games.
1615,Nice additional content to get in the orange box. You can’t really complain about it. It shows the game with better graphics and fancy lightning. And it is really short. Interesting goodie.
1616,"It is what it says on the box. It's a cut setpiece from Highway 17 and they added some fancier light graphics. I would have liked this if it was in the game since the skybox and environment looks like it could have been an interesting section, but Highway 17 [i]was[/i] a fairly long level so I can see why they cut it.

This takes like 10 minutes to complete, 13 minutes for first-timers. It's not much, but it's a nice addition and a neat little goodie."
1617,short like ur pp
1618,"Crazy short game. Beat it three times in under 40 minutes. Tbh this should just be a free expansion for HL2, not a full-on standalone game.
WORTH MONEY:
uhh no.
WORTH TIME: 
uhh yes.
WORTH AS CANON:
not much story, just gordon comes along and saves the day and leaves.
VERDICT:
Reccomended. It's good, but not AMAZING."
1619,"very nice tech demo. it's amazing how the devs got this level of effects and such low minimum system requirements. it's a shame you don't see too much of that nowadays. granted, half life 2 is 14 years old but you can't tell me that shit aged at all! it still looks really really good even to this day"

1623,"It's a very short segment cut from Half-Life 2, so you're getting exactly what you expect. You can finish it in an hour and it's fun on the way. However, I did run into a bug when trying to get into the church towards the end and had to noclip my way inside. Other than that, it was fun."
1624,this game is after half life 2 but it is short but it is still fun to play
1625,yay
1626,"i have only been playing this game for one night now and ive already beaten it 3 times, its fun and quick and good to speedrun. my best is 7 mins. i know a dude that is 6th place in speedrunning for this game"
1627,"Just a lightning showcase, you will play it for 5 minutes, and it's over, nothing to see, it's better watch a YouTube video of the game instead of playing it."
1628,Cool little tech demo.
1629,nice
1630,"I got this with the half life bundle, its ok, there is not much to do and it can be hard to beat but is a bit fun, and   if you want more half life to play then this is for you!"
1631,"Can you believe there is some people with 40k+ hours in this game?
"
1632,"Great little side mission for those who liked Half-Life 2.
I do not recommend you buy this game as a standalone, It took me only 15 minutes to finish it."
1633,too sort
1634,Fun and would've enjoyed this in Half Life 2.
1635,Half life never gets old!
1636,"I'm lost in the middle of the coast, GORDON!!!!!"
1637,".......
"
1638,20 minute tech demo. Definitely don't buy it standalone but if youre getting the whole half life series this might be a little bit interesting
1639,Too short
1640,just a short extra game to the legendary HALF LIFE and the HALF LIFE 2
1641,7.9/10 a well made mod.
1642,"This really is simply a cut Half-Life 2 level. I don't know how it would have fit into the Highway 17 section, but although I didn't have a problem with it, people seemed to find Highway 17 too long already, so it was probably smart to cut it. It's still worth checking out though - the scenery is beautiful and the impressive church centrepiece shows off the HDR lighting nicely. It's not very clear how to progress up the hillside (ignore the stairs) but apart from that the puzzles are intuitive enough. After some unusual gunplay you're even given a boss fight with an enemy not seen in the original HL2, which is quite pleasing. Half an hour well spent."
1643,Very boring and bad
1644,epic
1645,"So short, yet so sweet."
1646,"Very boring, rushed and all out terrible. The amount of bloom there is burns my retinas and it feels like I am staring at the sun. 2/10, would not recommend."
1647,"It will drive you nuts in frustration.  I'm not a ""player"", just a weekend player, and I'm certain many players fing this easy. I don't know how. Good game, so I keep trying. good luck."
1648,Yes
1649,"HL3 is never going to arrive, but I still have hope."
1650,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a great game, but its very short."
1651,i like learning a bit more and also having a tiny bit more gameplay. i truly love half life
1652,yup
1653,You help a fisherman to clean the island
1654,The earth is 4.6 billion years old and we managed to exist at the same time as this masterpiece.
1655,it's pretty
1656,"This is one of the best demos demos i've ever played, i'm surprised that this wasn't in the base game?"
1657,Its garbage the whole game lasts 15 minutes at max
1658,wavky demo
1659,still don't know where that coast went man
1660,video game!?
1661,A fun and interesting tech demo.
1662,"Got it with the half life bundle, its really short and pretty good."
1663,"Do you like the source engine? Do you like learning about HDR and how valve uses it in their games? Do you like hearing the sweet voice of Lord GabeN? Well youve come to the right place, this entire ""game"" or shall i say tech demo is fun and interesting to learn about how the source engine uses HDR in their games, also its probably the best tech demo i've seen or played because it has ""some what"" of a story to it and as a plus, YOU LEARN YAY!, out of ten i'll give it a ten because as a tech demo it does it's job well. As a game however a 5 I think it deserves that."
1664,"Took me 3 minutes to beat, 10/10."
1665,"This demo got me massively blue balled for more HL2. It was fun, but did it really need to be this short?"
1666,"I dont understand anything of it but all i understand is Chapter 3 is comin boi.
"
1667,now this game is something unique. it's enjoyable and short. could have been the demo for half life 2. it wouldn't spoil anything in the game and would give the player access to all weapons except the bugbait to test it. it's still very fun and i enjoyed every seconds.
1668,2 years later and still better than hunt down the freeman
1669,Half-Life 2: Lost Coast
1670,Its not bad but its too short because it was a part of a mission in Half-Life 2 that go cut and is a tech demo so yeah don't waste your money on this because its like 15-20 minutes long.
1671,"It's unbelievable that the graphics are for 15 years ago .
The graphics are just too good !
"
1672,Pointless
1673,"It's Short,Fun and it's half-life the end"
1674,"Half-Life 2 Lost Coast is a short demo originally released to showcase and demonstrate the new capabilities of the updated Source engine, primarily its High Dynamic Range (HDR) feature. If you're expecting a long, exciting new addition to the Half-Life saga, you'll be disappointed. Originally meant to be a part of the chapter Highway 17 in the main Half-Life 2 release, this ride will last you about ten minutes. 
Don't get me wrong, although it's non-canon and very basic, it retains one shining quality: it's still Half-Life. I'd recommend this to anyone who considers themselves a big fan of the series, just not to the gaming community in general. This was Valve's first ""game"" to include the commentary nodes, and these are very interesting, as always. 
There's nothing here that Half-Life 2 (and its respective episodes) can't do already, so I'd advise anyone curious about this series to play those first."
1675,Great game. An all time classics!
1676,"Lost Coast is basically a tech-demo disguised as a game, therefore it offers nice graphics and location at cost of only one level. Unless you want to see the beauty of the game (or get props for Garry's Mod), there's nothing much to see here."
1677,I got lost in the church so I guess the game lives up to the title.
1678,"It's a really neat tech demo, but not much else"
1679,"Ok so this is a short 15 - 20min tech demo by valve showing off HDR lighting (which is a light effect which recreates how to human eye reacts to bright lights and dark environments.

The level itself is really fun and pretty and for me has alot of replay ability. If this level was in base game hl2 it would 100% be my favourite level and for sure be one of the most memorable parts.

9/10 should have been longer"
1680,Fun game
1681,Советую всем эту игру
1682,Half life 2 Story line is better than this
1683,"Short and sweet is really all this is.  Very, very short.  Like, minutes short.  Good, balanced combat.  Plenty of opportunity to use any weapon.  The extent of the plot is ""destroy the bad guys"".  I've had this mod for years and I got hopelessly stuck at the only real puzzle in the mod when I first played it.  Now, it shouldn't be too difficult for a seasoned Half-Life player."
1684,i finished the game 20 time and played it for 10 hours. pretty fun
1685,the gameplay is ok
1686,i heard gaben so this is a yes from me
1687,YES!
1688,Really good game.
1689,"May be 15 minutes long, but Pyro is right, you'll have a way better experience here than the entirety of Hunt Down The Freeman"
1690,I promise I didn't leave my computer on
1691,.
1692,epic
1693,epic
1694,"You get it free with one of the best games ever made, so why not?"
1695,"The Fisherman in this game is very famous, I very much approve this game."
1696,Quick Little Level. Worth Buying EP1 for.
1697,"Pretty good. Nice graphics and scenery, and overall a good experience. I'm sad it was over so soon."
1698,"A nice tech demo with some insight into how valve creates levels, I personally like it."
1699,"Not bad, not bat, not bad...

but is a very short demo....

I expect something different



THE GOOD NEW? It's a Free game :) Hahahahahahaha"
1700,Decent chapter in the story. 8/10
1701,"I understand that it is technical demo, but really, did we need it?

4/10"
1702,"I strongly recommend fans of HL to play this. Hearing Gabe and his team talk to you about the Source engine really makes you appreciate the passion that was brought to HL2, and you shouldn't miss this short commentary for the world!

Unrated because it isn't really a game."
1703,I like the size of the game and its a quick level to go through.
1704,"Very old yet very good game. Still holds up well in 2020! Excellent weapons, fun gameplay. LOVED going back to this1"
1705,Travel to [i] The Coast[/i]
1706,"It's very short, but still cool and impressive."
1707,"i found the coast 
tital is lying"
1708,I mean it's something?
1709,"trash
"
1710,short and pithy
1711,why do i have so many hours on this
1712,A bit short but great. 8.5/10 gr8 game.
1713,ok valve
1714,mmmmmmm nice
1715,Scam
1716,Better atmosphere and story than HDTF
1717,A tech demo by the half life people
1718,so i beated the game twice
1719,"Bit short by any standards, but still nice blast from past"
1720,This is just a tech demo/ behind the scenes. It's not worth paying but it is nice to see how they came up with solutions for problems.
1721,5/5
1722,"good gameeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"
1723,"A nice show in promise for Valve that feels especially fresh in 2020, the first time Half Life became exciting in well over a decade."
1724,its pretty short
1725,"Fun little addition, but doesn't really add anything. actually a little unclear at two points which is sad because its so short."
1726,THis is a bucket
1727,"Visually stunning game, all thought the story is non-existent and it does nit even fit in the story line of Half Life 2. well worth a play, if not for the fun, for the visuals"
1728,"It's really just a tech demo for when they added HDR, takes 10 minutes to beat but it's more of what HL2 is. The level design is cool."
1729,"Recommended for those interested in learning more about how games are made, or the history of Half Life and Valve.

While technically a complete level, in the barest of terms, this is more of an interactive showcase of things like level design theory, water effects and lighting rendering. It's fun enough to be worth a play through if you already got it with the rest of the franchise bundle, though, in my opinion."
1730,Neat little tech demo.
1731,Game randomly ends after 15 mins.
1732,"Very interesting on how the developers of Valve made half-life 2 as well as develop the engine. But the water gives you a missing texture picture if you go underwater. 

9/10 
Valve should use this engine on half-life: source"
1733,"DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT A FULL HALF LIFE GAME, THIS IS A TECH DEMO CREATED TO SHOWCASE VALVE'S HDR TECHNOLOGY

Despite literally just being a ~30 minute tech demo, its a damned good one at that. The sole objective of this is for Gordon to go kill some combine and that's it. If you got this in a half life bundle then its probably worth it however you would be disappointed buying this standalone.

11/10"
1734,"Yeah HF2 tech demo, 15 years later i played it for the first time :D"
1735,Its a 18 minute half life game pretty fun
1736,"It's Half Life and it's free, just get it already.  (hey that rhymed)"
1737,bruh its just more half life 2 why not
1738,Still waiting for HL3
1739,"Absolutely disappointing. A really bad story and it's so short! I thought that Valve would make a sequel to Half Life but nope instead it's just saying ""hey look at how we make games haha no Half Life 2 for you!"" unbelievable. 9/10."
1740,"it's a short demo game showing how much valve inproved but it kinda lacks it's half life charm it has missing textures one guy you don't even know even you don't no where it takes place but killing combines and using cheats is my fav go try it out it comes with half life 2 
"
1741,10/10 why so short tho
1742,the fisher guy is pretty cool the leeches are nice
1743,A nice way to learn about the technical leaps and gameplay improvements Valve made for Half-Life 2.
1744,epic cool 2007 valve tech demo number 7835 and it coolers than that hunt down manfree geam
1745,👍
1746,"By far one of the most educational experiences I've had in a game, it was really fun listening to the team talk about the process of making a level. If anyone is interested in 3d modeling or designing games, I would really recommend this. 

It may be a bit late, but I hope Valve does more demos like this one."
1747,infinite replayability
1748,Beautiful
1749,"tech demo, not worth it :p"
1750,"despite claiming lost coast was cut content the map itself was not present in any of the 2003 HL2 leak files, weird right?

could've just ported airex valve come on"
1751,Nice short chapter.
1752,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is basically a one level tech demo. It looks somewhat better than the base game, but it's very short. Of course the game play is still rock solid. Shooting feels great, controls are very tight and responsive. The island locale is a nice change of pace from the original. It comes bundled free with a purchase of Half-Life 2, so don't bother to buy it separately. It's like a cherry on the top of a cake. Not the main attraction but a nice little morsel to enjoy."
1753,A short story with the atmosphere of a fairy tale...
1754,Little 15 minute tech demo that everyone expected would be a lot longer.
1755,A beautiful level that was unfortunately cut out!
1756,"The only reason I got this was cause its free with HL2. If it was separate from the game, I wouldn't buy. I beat it in 20 minutes. I really don't have a lot to say about this, just because its one little mission. Not really interesting to play, but whatever."
1757,2005
1758,"Nah, it was free. 6/10"
1759,This is just a tech demo for the source engine. Not much to say about it really..
1760,"As far as I'm concerned this is the best Half-Life game and nobody can convince me otherwise.

Graphics: 9/10 it pushes what you thought the source engine was capable of doing, truly impressive.
Stability: 8/10 while being a source game it is more stable than most other source titles
Story: 10/10 the half life games are lore rich and know how to tell a story, this one is no exception
Gameplay: 10/10 good old classic half life gameplay, It truly was at its peak in this game thanks to the expansive arsenal you start the game with and the endless amounts of rockets you get rewarded with at the end
Music: 10/10 hl2 soundtrack

Overall: 9.6/10 This is truly the best half life game, the atmosphere and combat is second to none, the characters are good, and for once you accomplish something as Gordon without accidently setting off another stage of the apocalypse. And you even get to hear Gape Newell whisper in your ear about HDR"
1761,"I always wonder what giant leap this engine was for its time. Honestly, I think it still looks good. Compared to the contemporary FPS games back in time, it played and looked as if it came from an another universe."
1762,"A nice way to show how bad your graphics card is, even in 2020."
1763,"I didn't like this one!
So short! And it finishes quickly"
1764,Very interesting.
1765,Shorter than the time it took for Changed to basically take over the world
1766,eh
1767,Great short game! 10/10
1768,"I don't really think it is that great, it is very short. I just don't really know why valve wasted their time making this short game. 5/10"
1769,This was a really fun way to learn about the game development and still get a bit of a challenge
1770,Half Life 3
1771,"It's a simple game, however, it's got great graphics, smooth game play and perfect
 for a guy like me .Love games, don't have a million hours to invest n becoming
 an expert in any kind of a game. Has a great shoot 'm Up  theme, it's just fun!"
1772,Yeah it's pretty good.
1773,"This was a great game, but i think that this was too short."
1774,A nice littie demo
1775,I NEVER WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME EVER AGAIN ITS ABSOLUTE DOGSHIT HL2 IS BETTER WORST TECHDEMO OF ALL TIME
1776,Wow Nice
1777,"short game, holy graphics for some reason?? and this is a good ""demo""."
1778,"It feels like a Demo for Half-Life 2, but this game actually just serves to demonstrate the improvements they've made back then. No need to play this, but it was interesting!"
1779,Its pretty fun for 20 minutes cause the game only lasts 20 minutes.
1780,Nice demo
1781,It is good game but I don’t why I get goose bumps when I contact the enemies..
1782,i hate valve for not refunding me hl2 when i was within miniutes of 2hr mark
1783,HL2:LC is basically the lost island from Goldeneye 64: The game
1784,ok
1785,for a short game its pretty good
1786,"Although it merely consists of a single level, it's worth playing for two main reasons. First, it was initially planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2 but eventually scrapped so it's nice to see this great sequence resurrected from the cutting room floor. And secondly, it's utterly gorgeous to look at."
1787,"It's a cool short tech demo. Nothing too suprising, but very fun."
1788,A fun little tech-demo. You can have fun out-of-bounds too.
1789,"thought it was a sequel to episode two and decided to play it after the initial shock of ep2's ending

i'm so sad that it wasn't a sequel but at least i took out my frustrations on an entire army of combine forces"
1790,Half Life.
1791,"“Half-Life 2: Lost Coast” is basically like a deleted movie scene that didn’t make the final cut. Only that, other than most deleted scenes in movies, “Lost Coast” is more of a standalone product, because it was also used as a tech demo for more realistic lighting effects when it came out, a year or so after the main game’s release. It’s way too short to add anything of real significance to the “Half-Life 2” story or experience, but it’s there, it’s free, and it’s a fun, artistically beautiful little level to play through. If you enjoyed “Half-Life 2”, you may as well give it a try."
1792,i canot find it
1793,"I always thought it was just at tech demo so I never played it, but it's one quick level. You have to commend the developers for this engine though, even after 15+ years it still looks great. I would not buy it, but you will probably get it with most of the HL packs anyway."
1794,Leaches (You Wont Understand it Unless You Played It)
1795,"Not actually sure what the point of this was, but fun I guess"
1796,"Good for a deleted level, very short but otherwise pretty neat"
1797,"Its good, but short, I wish it was longer, I mean you can see the background but it would've been awesome to be able to go there ya know. As is its a bit short but still a fun twenty minutes, if that."
1798,"With the game sadly being very short, this was actually a pretty fun game!
I loved the gameplay! But also, it's sad to see the fisherman go, he could of been a good character in HL2."
1799,"its an hdr tech demo, and the actual playable game is very short, but its worth picking up on sale"
1800,"Good for what it is, is a good time sink."
1801,"It's fine, but I don't recommend buying it as standalone. It's only worth it if you got it included in either the Half-Life series bundle or part of the Valve bundle"
1802,Its just 1 extra mission
1803,"I'd say it's a really good game but it ends after 15 minutes. It's a very short game. I'd buy it and play it but if you want more, sorry."
1804,"Starts game
*blinks once* 
It's over?"

1811,"-[h1] Mini Review [/h1]
Half life 2 lost coast is a tech demo released by Valve in 2005. This is an add on to one chapter in Half life 2 and is used to showcase source engine's HDR feature. It's a very good tech demo and a cool bit of the game that was cut to actually explore through. It's very tiny and not much to it but it doesn't have to be since it came with my Half life bundle. In conclusion, this is a cool piece of valve history that all Half life fans should check out."

1816,"Short lived, but nice. That is all I have to say for this quick ol' game. I shouldn't really call this a game, it's just so short, but whatever."
1817,This is the best demo of all time its a good demonstration of the source engine and its a completely original level its only about ten minutes long but when your done on the community tabs ther's lots of fun challenges to do
1818,a demo.
1819,"Mine wont load any more than the first 10min, must be a glitch. just ends 1/4 through first stage
"
1820,"Sorry to say, this was not a good level. I am not surprised it was not part of the original game."
1821,very short but still its nice when your bored.
1822,The game is too short for long time players of shoot em ups.
1823,aight
1824,"It's interesting, shows you what you have to work with, definitely nice to look around in."
1825,"Steve on HL2: Lost Coast
A well crafted and interesting insight into the development of a much loved title. It's short, sweet and best played with commentary included. An excellent cherry atop the triple scoop that is Half-Life 2. 

Verdict: N/A  - Tech Showcase. 
[spoiler] ""A final word from the great man himself... and Gabe Newell .""[/spoiler]"
1826,good yes
1827,Beautiful water
1828,I do like leeches
1829,20-30 min tech demo. Watch it with dev commentary! Very interesting.
1830,HmM yEs HaLF lIFe GuUd
1831,This game really rocks.
1832,"""I, eh, hope you like leeches."""
1833,A quick tech demonstration that came to me after finishing half life 2 story.
1834,still better than hunt down the freeman
1835,"A cool little game demo that Valve were trying out to see if their gaming audience would be interested in seeing some commentary on their games from the actual developers.

Really short you just do one quick mission I recommend turning the commentary on so you can learn a bit more about the game process from the devs.

Lots of complaints about this game in the reviews but come on it came free with the HL package you didn't have to pay for it (if you are given the option of paying it all depends on if you just want to collect all the HL series or are interested in the development process if not don't buy) and it clearly states that it is a tech showcase.

I found it interesting so why not :)"
1836,not much of a game u can do it under 10 minutes
1837,"A true masterpiece, only rivaled by Half Life's other expansion packs!"
1838,yes
1839,"It took me [b]~60 minutes[/b] to complete it on the hardest difficulty with no HUD, [i]and I enjoyed every second of it.[/i]"
1840,good graphics
1841,its short but cool
1842,"It's not a content addition, just you paying a fee so they can flaunt their experimental software at you."
1843,Pretty much just a tech demo. Nothing else.
1844,10/10!
1845,"Hilarious benchmark scores on today's GPUs.
Too bad they never finished it out as a story."
1846,No
1847,"Hey, you there! Wait a minute now... aren't you? Ah, you are! You're that scientist chap — Freedman, Fishman — am I right? You must be here to take on the Combine. Not sure what one man can do, but... no other reason to visit Saint Olga at a time like this. I'll take you where they made their base — or as far as I can, at any rate. 

Here, now, let me just unlock this gate for ya. Got the key ri-right here... There we go! Get along now, laddy. Destroy that gun, and no dawdling. Go on through, lad. 

You did it, lad. Come on with me to Saint Olga. We'll celebrate this victory with a feast! I eh... hope you like... leeches. Hey, where you goin'? You're getting fuzzy around the edges! Well, I guess you got other places to be. Uh, nice knowin' ya!"
1848,"you must be here to take on the leeches, no other reason to visit the combine at a time like this, i'll take you to where they've made their feast, or, as far as i can at any rate."
1849,It's pretty s h o r t .
1850,"Play with dev commentary on, otherwise there's not much point."
1851,How do you unlock the 2nd chapter?
1852,ty
1853,it is basically just a showcase of some things in hl2 lol
1854,half life
1855,nice but short. but if you want to play that you must buy half life 2
1856,Old but gold
1857,what's the point?
1858,"It's free, it's 20 minutes long, if you like Half-Life 2, play this as well"
1859,Its a pretty neat tech demo at first but in my opinion the map is just too big and you have to only follow a obvious pathway that along the line just becomes wacky and weird but overall  its a pretty good game
1860,ok
1861,very epic
1862,"A fun level. It is only one level, so not too much to play, but still more Half Life! The fisherman character was cool and I would love to see more of him, whether as an easter egg in later HL games or as a full character."
1863,A nice little level
1864,Lost Coast is a cool tech demo for some features that were added to the source engine. It's a cut level from Half Life 2 and it is beautiful. I think I got this for owning Half Life 2 and I have to say that this is a wonderful addition to the Half Life world.
1865,Really shows off how beautiful the Source engine was at the time.
1866,Play this when you dont have any more half life 2 to play.
1867,"I dont even know what this game is, i think it is cut cottent, it is also really short, it only took me 13 minutes to beat it, only buy it if you dont mind throwing money away
"
1868,I like the gameplay and graphics
1869,"EVEN THO ITS ALREADY A BAD GAME YOUR BAD VALVE SINCE YOU I GOT THE WHOLE ENTIRE SERIES FOR FREE
NOW WHEN THE DAYS/WEEKS GO OUT WHY DO I HAVE TO PERCHASE THIS WITH REAL MONET"
1870,wezxsa
1871,"Such an amazing experience with and without the developer commentary! Not only is this very fun, but it is also educational! 10/10 I'd recommend for Half-Life fans and gamers as a whole. A great 30 min"
1872,ya
1873,good

1875,"A short tech demo based on content cut from Half-Life 2. The graphics were a little glitchy for me, but it was still a fun little mission."
1876,"9/10

This is pretty fun for a tech demo. Although it's short as hell, I like to replay this a lot."
1877,"Half life Lost Coast is a fun, scraped, half life episode that takes Gordon Freeman into a new setting, that being a shore-line. Gordon wakes up, and finds himself on a shore-line. He walks for a while before speaking with a fisherman who gets his name wrong to many times. Gordon gets mad and kills the fisherman. I'm joking. The fisherman actually tells Gordon Friendman about there being a rocket-turret-death thing on top of a nearby hill. He wants you to spit on  it, (since it's main focus is shooting the near by town releasing headcrabs), and then come back down to talk some more. You climb up the combine infested hill along side with your weapons, and eventually take out the rocket-turret-death thing. While you escape, you get noticed by some UWU thirsty helecopter, and some combine. While leaving them behind also, you have to take down the helecopter with some rocket-launchers . Afterwords, you climb down below the supports of the facility, and get lowerd down back to the fisherman in a human size grate. He thanks you and you teleport out. I like that there is a 'bad ending' where you completely forget about the combine, (not killing ANY), climb up the hill, don't destroy the rocket-turret-death thing, and hop on a few boxes while strafing a jump from a rocket launcher, into the human sized grate. You must do specific moves in order to trigger the bad ending. When you get down back to where the fisherman used to be, you will see he is not there, and that the town or village is destroyed. The camera fades to black, and you are filled with a emotion of guilt. Asshole. With that all being said, I rate the side game, 7/10."
1878,Best Game of All-Time.
1879,Botifol
1880,waiting for half life 2: found coast
1881,good cut chapter from half life 2 made as a test for many things
1882,Surprisingly short but nice warm-up while the main game installs.
1883,Nice half-life 2 demo
1884,"Good bit of fun, walking around in the elevator at the end freaks it out, I ended up falling out and dying and the old dude was like `You Did It!`."
1885,"It's basically a free benchmarking tool for HL2. Idk why you would want to benchmark it, since anything that could run a x86 OS, would also be able to run HL2."
1886,It's essencially a 10-15 minute tech demo. Surprisingly fun! I love the location and actually enjoyed this much more than the regular highway section. Get it for free with the game or something.
1887,"A short tech demo inside the world of HL. Nothing much to say about it, only play it if you're a hardcore HL fan."
1888,"Half Life 2: Lost Coast, is a fantastic game showing the engine of Source but gives an alternate story to Half Life 2. Now at first, I would never dream about this game. But after Half Life: Alyx, I want Gordon to go to St. Olga. For funsies, maybe the fisherman is glad to see you again but Eli admits that Gordon was never here."
1889,"A short trial package to try the source engine. but still beautiful
"
1890,Great game
1891,I played this in 2020 :D
1892,good benchmarking tool
1893,"Feels like an extra level for Half-Life 2, which is a good thing."
1894,Nice interactive video from Gaben
1895,beautiful and great physic game
1896,"Very nice tech demo for the Half-Life series. Its nice to see how the team of Valve create masterpieces like Half-Life.

7/10"
1897,"Short and fun.
A demonstration of gaming technology.
"
1898,cmon its half life of course its good
1899,"awe inspiring game, i was in tears at the end."
1900,"would you believe that not once, not twice, but now [i]three times[/i] i had someone tell me ""HDR is impossible unless you have an HDR monitor""?

hmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
1901,"Gorgeous tech demo, it's short but shows up all HL2 mechanics very well, a must play!"
1902,it good
1903,"Better than Half-Life: Alyx BS because of no VR BS and no Alyx BS, LOL."
1904,Cool mechanics and can't wait to play Half-Life Alyx.
1905,.
1906,Great little tech demo. Not much more to say.
1907,There's nothing sadder than an empty crab-pot.
1908,0.1 hours k
1909,Very good short game.
1910,"Are you bored? why not play this game for 30-40 minutes?
Boredom of 30-40 minutes solved!"
1911,Cool tech demo
1912,"This fifteen to twenty minute expansion for half life 2 is just not worth it. It's just too short and buggy to have that half life feeling. And it's generally confusing for some parts. *Some* people think it's a half life 3 people didn't want to play, but in my opinion that is wrong."
1913,About 20 minutes of gameplay. Good for just a quick shooting session and pretty good graphics display.
1914,"Horrible gameplay. Unfinished environment. Almost every spot has exploitable map glitches.

I don't care if it is just a HDR tech demo level, it is of such poor quality compared to the rest of Half Life 2 games, it's a shame to have been officially released."
1915,"Now let me get this straight: this is the best Half-Life game this universe can see, Valve really outdid themselves and gave us Half-Life 3 all this time while the community didn't noticed. People have been complaining all this years while this beautiful thing is all finished, and waiting to be enjoyed. Hell, it's even a Half-Life 4 if you think about it. Who needs Half-Life: Alyx when you already have this in your hands? After playing this game I feel like playing all the other Half-Life games was a mistake, because they don't get to even a hundredth of this game's level of quality. To hell with the rest of the games"
1916,Well that was it. 19 mins of fun.
1917,its quick and over all a waste of time :-(
1918,bionicle
1919,Good if you are a half life saga fan and want to know more about valve´s games
1920,Nothing else to say about half life game
1921,"Lost Coast is a fun level that was never released into Half-Life 2. Besides being a short tech demo, fighting Combine soldiers uphill and downhill made this a unique fight. I also enjoyed some of the visuals including the architecture. If you are looking to play some Half-Life but don't want to commit to a full chapter in a single play session, then this is the perfect substitute. Game on."
1922,HDR is kool I guess
1923,"It says the ""lost coast"" but i found it in my steam library next to the other half life games."
1924,"great graphics, image resolution, and challenging gameplay"
1925,It's kinda sad that this hasn't made into the game.
1926,"Quick cut level, being a graphics demo, the graphics are good. Don't expect it to take more than 20 minutes. I suggest you play with dev commentary on, as it is very interesting."
1927,"[b]Aesthetics demonstration chapter.[/b]

1928,no
1929,Mildly interesting tech demo thingy.
1930,Fun and with good level-design
1931,Pretty atmospheric section. Nice to experience it.
1932,"In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#311 out of 612)... it's time for Half Life 2: Lost Coast.

More tech demo than game. But it's still more Half Life 2, so if that's something you want more of, and you don't really care how brief the the experience might be or how little narrative content it provides, you'll likely be able to eke some enjoyment out of the Lost Coast. Personally what little Lost Coast offers doesn't appeal much to me."
1933,a great demo its like a practice almost gives you most weapons but not all of them and shows how the gravity guns works
1934,Its the funnest game i played.
1935,yes
1936,nice but short
1937,unbelievably fun to break
1938,This game is 20 minutes of halflife gameplay. Dont pay for it xD
1939,This game took longer to download and install than it did to play and complete.
1940,"A bit on the short side of games, more like a demo but not quite. Graphics are great, story is not existent since it's more of a ""hey look at how beautiful it looks."" Rather than an actual proper game. It's a neat little experience though"
1941,Not a good game. Expected more out of it like the ability to go into the town after you disabled the headcrab shell launcher. BUT NO! you can't.
1942,Takes around 40-45 minutes to finish yet it doesn't really give anything different imo. u can go ahead and skip this 6/10
1943,"Too short, and i mean it!, since people have been speed running this one for a long time now, i know its just a representation of a new mechanic applied inside the game but would be nice if this part were like a full story dlc."
1944,"When u make 1 hour and 40 mins but u can beat the game under 20 mins . Beat the game 8-9 times + Do some random stuff  
Or just explore the other parts of the map  = 1hour and 40 mins"
1945,b r u h
1946,"Well, it is very short (one chapter), but it looks it is free for owners of Half-Life 2. Thank you Valve for free test drive."
1947,"wjhat the f***uck was valve thinkin with this ""game""
lost coast mor like lost in the f**ucking garbage can #epic fail #soy"
1948,"A little new adventure for Gordon ""Fishman"""
1949,"A quick 30-10 minute mission, perfect for those who just want to have a quick shoot around with 0 filler missions with it. You shoot combine, walk do more shooting, do a tiny puzzle, shoot more then walk to a balcony and shoot a helicopter and go down this lift and that's it."
1950,"Short bonus to Half Life 2. It is nice and cool. Nicely done monastery.
Note 8/10

Thanks Valve for letting me play half life franchise for two and half months for free. That's really generously and nice."
1951,A free(since 2016.6) standalone chapter comes with the full game.
1952,"I like the style of developer notes scattering around regarding the different details, it helps us as players understand what it took and the difficulties they faced making this. The only negative bar I'd set is that the audio of the developer notes did not enhance when played, so with the water, the gun, and combine firing.. all this extra noise drowned out the notes. Other than that, great addition to the series and a big thanks from me for them added the commentary."
1953,"It was a really fun 15 minutes, but the only feeling i had when it ended was sadness."
1954,Gaming Industry History!
1955,This is quick but its free (if you already have hl2) so its not a big deal
1956,19 minutes of quality Half-life 2 bonus content you most likely already own.
1957,great
1958,"15 minutes of fun only, but it's free so can't complain!"
1959,way too short. i completed in only 16 mins.
1960,"Short, was kinda fun and informative."
1961,Noice
1962,20 min speedrun bruh
1963,This is more of a tech demo. No an actual full game.
1964,"No sir, I don't like it..."
1965,"Interesting developer commentary. It was the first of Valve's commentaries, they were added in the games themselves in later releases, example: L4D; L4D2; Portal; Portal 2.
Shows of the HDR, its nice, if dated.
The gameplay is vertical, shame there wasn't more horizontal fighter in HL2. its fun."
1966,"Kinda short, but still fun. The puzzles and combat are pretty fun and the ""commentary nodes"" feature was really interesting.

I rate this game a 8/10."
1967,Iconic demo!
1968,it was fun
1969,Amazing tech demo that I actually like to come back to from time to time.
1970,"It's pretty neat, but really short."
1971,Just another short level.
1972,"Good stuff, even nowadays."
1973,It's Way too short. Like WAAAYYY too short. I know it's a scrapped Level but don't even bother. I beat it in 19 Minutes and i wasn't even sure where i was surposed to go half the time.
1974,This game isn't the best but not the worst... All I can say is it is worth trying...
1975,"A fun little mission, nice to see where all these headcrab shells are coming from."
1976,It's just a playable tech demo basically. Only 20 minutes long. What is there to recommend? Only for Half-Life completionists.
1977,Still a great game after 15 years.  Looks great in 2K also.
1978,good game.
1979,yaes
1980,10 Minute Half-Life experiance would play again 11/10
1981,short and fun
1982,good
1983,"THERE IS NOT MUCH GAMEPLAY HERE. The intro cutscene of Half-Life 2 is longer than this game. All you can do in this game is: talk to a fisher man, go up hill shooting Combines, put a candelier inside a missile pipe and go back down to the fisherman with a lowering platform. You can do all that in a couple of minutes. The commentary is all about HDR engine technicalities. HDR on the water, HDR on the Fisherman, HDR HDR. Geez. Not very interesting to anyone besides the devs themselves. No significant new assets in the game. Most mods are better than this HDR tech demo."
1984,wait i have 25 hours in this? this is literally a tech demo
1985,Updated my MacBook Pro and none of my Half Life games are accessible any longer.  This sucks!
1986,fail
1987,It lasted longer than i do atleast
1988,fun little well done mod
1989,"Nice little slice of what the team was working on, fun yet short level, wish the fisherman would make a return!

In all seriousness, spending 10 mins listening to the commentary nodes is worth your time and it's a little bonus added to your HL2 experience."
1990,Short but interesting!
1991,"Only reason I have 17 minutes in this game is I took 7 completing it slowly, and 10 exploring the out-of-bounds"
1992,am I eliete gamer now?
1993,Great short game for when I don't have time for something longer . FUN!
1994,why you lookin at my reviews
1995,Nice tech demo to show how the HDR works in the game.
1996,:D
1997,"Very short, yet very enjoyable"
1998,"very short, but definately should have been a part of hl2"
1999,I always wondered what HDR actually does.
2000,It's too long
2001,swsw
2002,"As long as you're not paying for this, it's a fine way to kill 10 minutes."
2003,its cool
2004,very game ^^
2005,e
2006,"Developer commentary was a really interesting thing to listen. Especially yours, Gaben"
2007,Cool
2008,"When i played it i thought it would be exciting at first.but. as i fought through 2 combine i started to get bored. then when i reached the church i didn't know how to finish the puzzle. but then after like 2 or 5 minutes i figured out i had to push the box into it. and then some poison headcrabs came out and they were PoIsOn HeAdCrAbS that's no fun!, then i had to fight some combine soldiers and all i had to do was grenade them, it was boring. then i had to fight a helicopter WICH WAS THE ONLY FUN BIT OF THE ENTIRE GAME AND IT WAS SHORT. then i went down some elevator. boring. so i jumped out into the water and did it that way. Then olmate told me that we would celebrate this then he decides no and boom game ends. conclusion: the game is too boring and isn't worth it."
2009,"Feels like a very short, typical HL2 level. (""Typical"" for HL is great!)"
2010,"[u] This is a Fun Little Action-Packed Mission [/u]
It's short, but why not if you like Half Life?
I like the Sailor Guy and the Boats and the Beach, it's a [b] vibe [/b]
But f*ck falling off the cliffside"
2011,"This is a one-map tech demo that showcased the then-fledgling HDR tech Valve were incorporating into future titles. In it, you'll fight the Combine on the edge of a cliff and the inside of a church. It's well textured, well laid out and features a sense of verticality that you don't really get in Half-Life 2 all that often. 

Did experience a bug where there were no underwater textures at all, and ducking under the water gave you the classic black and pink checkerboard error. It's a free slice of tech from 2005, so you can't really complain about anything here."
2012,good game
2013,HDR tech demo with 20 minutes of extra gameplay
2014,games fun when you want more hl and bored
2015,"A cut part of a chapter for Half-Life 2 that was made to taste test sauce features for some fisherman guy.

[spoiler]Little did you know you're dinner for leeches instead.[/spoiler]

Play it if you're bored and have nothing better to do with your life lmao."
2016,A (very) short introduction or glimpse into what Half-Life 2 and the Source engine can do.
2017,Killing my GPU still to this day
2018,Eh sure why not
2019,still good..replayed it today again for another run since its launch date
2020,"This was the first time I'd played Half Life on PC, but the game, despite having less than modern graphics, is still visually stunning.  I mean, less than 20 minutes of gameplay is still gameplay.  Is good!"
2021,A very nostalgic experience.
2022,A fun little HL 2 map.
2023,lost in walmart where's my mom
2024,One of the earlier and better HL2 mods.
2025,Recommended to those who want to know a little more about HL2.
2026,"It is just a short HDR demo. (Isn't a modern HDR thing of course.)
You can skip this title with peace of mind.
But if you have time, very curious about it and a huge fan of Half Life; I can't stop you right?"
2027,great for a short game
2028,sea
2029,"I have played for 5 hours, what is wrong with me?"
2030,you cant shoot they key guy
2031,This is a really short game but it's not bad. I like it.
2032,"I love Half Life in general, and finished it so quickly XD. It's fun"
2033,Its a Very cool Start to the series to see The Creators leave recordings and tell what they did. its a good idea for a game. half life has been Cool forever About 99% of it.        great game.   great start. and i would recommend this for either starters or half life fans Or just valve Fans in general. Well and people who play games.
2034,Commentary breaks the game.
2035,"If the coast is lost, why is it still there?"
2036,Better Ending than FarCry5's Ending
2037,needs more fish
2038,"The most fun I've ever had with a tech demo. Too bad it didn't make it into the actual game,"
2039,It's pretty chill. I dislike how disabling commentary mode disabled the AI in my playtime. Nitpick: sprinting to slippery roads making me fall to the start of the game a couple times but i guess it was made to showcase the design and the software so a slower aproach. Enjoyable.
2040,"I just wish it was part of the actual game, maybe as a beginning to E:1 or end to HL2"
2041,short but good
2042,"Watch my first impression of this game here https://youtu.be/eHLhOy4T0FU
I only did a quick speedrun of this game since i seen it was so short, but I love all the Half Life games, and Lost Coast from what I've seen, is a good little sample platter of a bunch of Half Life fun rolled up into a bite sized chunk. Have fun with it if you decide to buy it, and remember to play all your steam games!"
2043,The first thing I ask a girl on a date is if they have played this game. If they say no then I leave.
2044,Interessante ver os comentários dos desenvolvedores sobre as tecnologias que haviam sido criadas recentemente para o Engine do Half-Life 2. Vale a pena para quem se interessa por tecnologias 3d e outras coisas do tipo.
2045,pineapple.
2046,"Well, the church was awesome."
2047,Feels like it means something but I can't find out what it is.

2050,ok
2051,you wanna tell me i just bought this for on short mission????????????????
2052,"outstanding short game for those that maybe have never played a half life game and want to see what the action looks like. This is a very good stand alone game to sharpen up your FPS skills, if nothing else. Enjoyed it very much..............."
2053,I don't get it.
2054,extra 22 minutes? why not!

2073,It is short but it is a free demo.
2074,That is a nice graphic for 2005 game
2075,"[h1] A pretty tech demo that you can gawk at for 10 minutes [/h1] 

[b] Graphics [/b] 
It looks the same as Half-Life 2 [b] (what did you expect?) [/b] with the addition of HDR and bloom. After all, that IS what this demo was made for.

[b] Spec requirements [/b] 
If you can run Half-Life 2, you'll probably run this fine with little loss of FPS due to bloom.

[b] Story [/b]
No story to really note here, but you do meet a fisherman that looks two times more realistic than anybody you'll meet in HL2. Why? Again, it's a tech demo, they want to show off pretty graphics.

[b] So, overall? [/b]
Everybody was looking forward to this technology in 2005, and a few years later every single game that came out had a massive overuse of bloom. There's a little bit of combat, if you get bored."
2076,"it's a good demo showing HDR and Water reflections, With a nice little story."
2077,MY EYES!!!
2078,Awesome
2079,Great for a short little respite from reality and a chance to try different techniques to get to the end.
2080,IT FUN
2081,A lost chapter in the epic journeys of Gordon Freeman. What's not to like?
2082,it was fun to play the game but it was to short
2083,bruh coast is lost like the house
2084,"You wouldn't believe the amount of story put into this game, trust me it'll get your nuts quakin and when I say quakin your nuts will be fuckin quakin.

2087,"Lost Coast is practically a glorified demo for the main game; though it includes no actual content from HL2, it still provides a demonstration of the combat and graphics engine. It's a short play, but a good way to kill a half-hour."
2088,"Its a simple 15 minute map that is quite enjoyable. Would not by it by itself. better to get it with hl2. You can extend your play time with the multiple challenges you can do in this game due to the freadom it gives. some ex include=
 - use only the gravity gun (with fisher mans spear or boat hook) 
 - go out of bounds (best way is to use the 2 boxes from the hill area to get up in the wall right befor the court yard) (enables you to go just about eny were in the map even to the cliff town and under the map)
 - prevent the bridge from destroying by grabbing plasma ball and throwing it back
 -  get glitched ending by not stoping the head crab cannon (2 box method to go up the building and then the helecopter stage is recommended)
 - bring all the amo crates to 1 area"
2089,"It could be in the half life 2, and it was in beta version of half life 2. Unfortunately, they’re cut this part of gameplay, when we destroy the things with headcrabs."
2090,Great way to show all the work put into the game.
2091,"Pretty cool bonus level, but don't expect anything crazy."
2092,"THE Coolest tech demo I have ever played. Not only does it show off the insane lighting technology that they were creating 15 years ago, but it also includes snippets of audio from the developers, explaining how everything works and what they used to make it work."
2093,"very quick, its ok"
2094,Yea it's aight
2095,"[i]Half-Life 2: Lost Coast[/i] is a short but interesting look into the work the developers put into the base game and details how their minds made major decisions that impacted the end product.

This is only a cut level from [i]Half-Life 2[/i] and therefore there isn't much in the way of gameplay to get out of this experience, so if you are expecting anything extravagant or vital to the [i]Half-Life 2[/i] canon, you will be disappointed. Going in understanding the point of this experience, the commentary given for the level design is very interesting and informative about their process as they go through graphic capability, level design, and so on. It spans only about fifteen to twenty minutes depending on how much you explore and listen to the commentary provided, but it is still an enjoyable experience that informs the player willing to learn. 

Not everybody will appreciate what the developers have offered in [i]Half-Life 2: Lost Coast[/i], but those who do will get a fuller experience not only from this cut level and commentary, but the main game it is based off of.

2096,"Pretty neat as a bonus level, even though it's basically a tech demo. Worth playing."
2097,it has gaben i approve
2098,"It's a curiosity, but I wouldn't even call it a level. At best, it's about 30 min of easy game play and ends abruptly."
2099,"Nice bonus level to play in Half-Life 2. Can see why it was scrapped; not always easy to figure out what you need to do (namely jamming the rocket launcher in the church building to progress). Worth your 15-20 minutes of time to play :)

7/10"
2100,This really showcased how beautiful Source Engine games were at the time.
2101,asdfasdfdfsa
2102,more Half-life 2. worth of playing one time.
2103,wait...This isn't half life 3.
2104,very nice
2105,Test
2106,It's reley cool and I like the fisherman you meet at the start :D.
2107,"Wait a minute now...aren't you.... 
You are! You're that scientist chap-Friedman, Fishman—am I right?"
2108,"Best Half-Life game ever hands down, just behind Blue Shift and the Dreamcast version of HL 1."
2109,I'm really bad at fps but even I can win this one.
2110,Good Game! Got after bought Half-Life 2!
2111,Great overall tech demo. Shows the additions of HDR to the Source engine. Great 15 minutes of Valve content.
2112,This is a tech demo that you get for free. Can't say I didn't enjoy it though.
2113,A great peek into a slice of gaming history
2114,"It's a graphics demo and not much more, but pretty ok 15 Minutes."
2115,go find it.
2116,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is essentially a free technology demo for a heavily altered/cut section from Half-Life 2. For the time of release, it shows some impressive capabilities of the new (at the time) Source Engine from Valve, as well as an interesting developer commentary included. For a fun, educational, little free experience, give this demo a try."

2118,"HL2 Lost Coast is fun time after time. Just challenging enough that you can't just rush through no matter how good you think you are. The game is old by today's standards, but still looks good, and was darn good looking back in 2005. Computers had a hard time churning out the action produced by this game. This short mini game is short but sweet, and can be finished in under and hour. All the HL2's and episodics are wonderful. Try them all out."
2119,Fun little demo of what you'll get from Half-Life 2
2120,My cyberman ass enjoyed this
2121,Best!
2122,I would play this in my spare time if I don't know what to do within 5-10 mins. I usually use sv_cheats and mess around with crap.
2123,"This will most likely leave you quite impressed. The 'game' looks really good, which does come as quite the surprise when taken into consideration that it's a demo from around 15 years ago. One of the things Valve has actually done right. I won't spoil what's in it, but it's beautiful and worth taking a look at. Enabling commentary is recommended, because that way you'll get an insight to some of the developing processes etc. If you own HL2 (which you should, by the way), check this out as well. It's very short, but you'll find yourself going back to it every once in a while.

A solid 6/10 even by today's standards.
"
2124,nice
2125,Half Tech Demo 2
2126,i mean its free half life content
2127,A beautiful game. Short and sweet.
2128,"Very short, but really cool. Has an ""arena"" section that has really good flank angles. Speedruns take mere minutes."
2129,I don't know what i was expecting from it.
2130,"Well, you can't go wrong with a free demo and more Half-Life 2 gameplay. Bit of a shame in retrospect that they didn't include this in the final game, but beggars can't be choosers.

So... Yes."
2131,very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very short
2132,no
2133,The most classic FPS game I  have played! And its also the best game in my own rank. The immersive interactive experience is my taste. So I like  Prey and HL which I think is bravo!! Hope the HL3 will appear to the market till I am alive!
2134,Where can I find more of this?! :D
2135,[i]Half Life 2: Lost Coast[/i]
2136,My score fot the game is :  6/10
2137,"One of the best, most enjoyable maps I've seen.  The map section across the cove wasn't completed.  I'm guessing that nobody thought we could get there?  Wouldn't it be awesome if it was totally finished?"
2138,"In short:
Very short but, i do enjoy seeing the head crab mortar, always wondered what it looked like! If you are looking for a long game, this is NOT for you, but if you REALLY want to get more half life games, do it!
Also the fisherman is amazing"
2139,Neat Little Tech Demo
2140,"A context-less level, with nothing to recommend it over literally any other shooter. Not worth your time."
2141,A short ( less than 30 minutes) mod for HL2.
2142,very well done demo
2143,"Really good tech demo, makes me sad about HL3 tho..."
2144,a free gmod level that comes with the purchase of half-life 2
2145,"I got lost on the coast for about an hour, swam across the sea only to find out I was out of bounds, restarted, got killed by a Bine, and then beat the mission. But its the only other half life game I had left to play, so five stars?"
2146,Wish they added this to the game
2147,"Lost Coast is not a full game, but it's fun for the very brief time it takes to finish. It's just a little taste of something. I wouldn't pay money for it, but if you are a Half Life fan, it's worth a few minutes of your time."
2148,why do i have 24 hours on this
2149,lost
2150,"[h1]Life changing gaming experience or:[/h1]
A 30-minute ad for Gaben's contact email."
2151,the pinnacle of human achievement
2152,well that was short and sweet
2153,"Looks great for a tech demo and it's a neat piece of beta content from HL2. If you want to have some classic Half-Life fun for a few minutes, this is the game for you."
2154,Better than Hunt Down The Freeman
2155,You're only going to play it once and it's 20mins long. Still fun for what it is tho
2156,WHY DID I GOT STUCKED IN THE CHURCH?!
2157,Incomplete.  Very primitive.
2158,more like lost toast lmao XDDDDDD
2159,This game is a masterpiece of the video game! Really ! I advise you eyes close!
2160,"Ehh. It's okay, but don't expect much.

PROS
+More Half-Life 2
+Probably the last Half-Life game we'll see
+Commentaries were actually kinda interesting.

CONS
-Only 20 minutes, including commentaries.
-Wish this could just be imported into HL2 as a side area from the airboat or something.

It's a 10 minute tech demo. I got it for free, so I don't mind, and Half-Life 2 is fun, so it was nice, I guess."
2161,"not going to pretend i'm super interested or informed about source engine or game design in general, but it was a neat 10 minutes of my time.



oh im sorry


18 hours of my time"
2162,"Why does this waste of time even exist?! It's so bad, that I wish they hadn't even have given it to me for free."
2163,"it's a tech demo, not a real game, but good to play through every once in a while"
2164,Great 15-30 min tech demo with Half-Life 2 story implications. I really like the vertical level design rarely seen in Half-Life 2 and listening to developer commentary is very engaging and interesting. As a bonus in the Orange Box it is worth checking out.
2165,A really great deleted storyline of Half-Life 2 & has a greater stress test than ever!!!!
2166,yes game
2167,"pretty good actually shows what valve is like behind the scenes and what they make, it should have been in half life 2 and mabey a bit longer but this inspired me to make a game like this, 7/10 pretty fun."
2168,better than actual half life 2
2169,game sux
2170,good demonstration
2171,Fun little graphic demonstration game. Not really relevant to the story of half life in general but pretty cool to hear the devs talk about different stuff that is and isn't used in the games.
2172,"A short but fun ride. 

(Remember how amazing we thought HDR was when it first came out? My PC could barely run it at the time!)"
2173,A 14 year old tech demo still surprises me with how good it looks...
2174,"Pretty cool tech demo, the commentary was my favorite."
2175,"Amazing game

PS: My Steam hours are not accurate"
2176,it is good but extremely short
2177,make us hl3 now!
2178,really short but ig cool because half life
2179,god
2180,"Nothing much to see here other than a cut section from Half-Life 2 repurposed into a tech demo. It comes free with Half-Life 2, so why not?"
2181,"Just a game to show people how Valve make their stuff, it's a nice little tour"
2182,really fun short level that was cut from the original half life 2 game. i would never pay a separate fee just for this level but fun to play after half life 2 if it comes part of the bundle. took me about half hour to beat the whole thing and has commentary by the devs which was pretty cool.
2183,Unsure what i paid for this but is was not worth it i am sure run fine for a ten minute game or so!  so i would say don't wast your money on this demo
2184,"i Like it its Cool To See How You Made This Game

2185,"This is a tech-demo that lasts 15 minutes. But, at least it looks nice, though. It's alright. 

Overall Score: 71 % 

- Comes free with Half-Life 2."
2186, 😊 Good Game...
2187,"One of the best classical first-person shooter ever. 

Everyone knows Counter Strike and they love it so, this pearl has the same system and technology with all the benefits of the single player. In addition, the story is really elaborated, challenging and intriguing. To summarize what are you going to find up: you will play as a Gordon Freeman, following and traveling through a coastal cliffs in order to destroy a Combine headcrab artillery launcher in a monastery, which is firing on a nearby town.

Should be a must have game in all gamer's libraries. Black Mesa awaits you."
2188,"It's Half Life 2, but shiny!

It's a short level based on a cut segment of Highway 17 from Half Life 2.
The story is you are helping a fisherman defeat a Combine head crab launcher in a church in St. Olga. You need to climb the hill, and fight Combine over watch on the way up. At the top, you must sabotage the device, and then fight a helicopter before reuniting with the fisherman at the bottom. 
If you have Half Life 2, and want to dip into a cut level with HDR, then give this a play. Took me less than 30 minutes to complete on Normal difficulty. I had fun."
2189,"Not sure why buy each Half-Life is just bad
1.It looks like shiiiiit
2.Gameplay suck.s
3.It's a waste of money
4.Not sure why people want Half-Life 3 when so far every half life game was bad.."
2190,this game was very short but was worth my time and i thought it was neat and i went through all the dev commentary too
2191,"It's just an outdated tech demo by now, not [i] really[/i] a game. Got it with the Orange Box, so basically for free (?). 10-20 min of gameplay, few battles and puzzles."
2192,good
2193,"its half life 3 i guess?

why does this exist it takes 10-20 minutes to complete just put it in the main game >:(

it comes free with hl2 though so thats nice
i remember there being a buy button and the price being $10
if you bought this game for 10 dollars i feel bad for you

its just a tech demo showcasing lighting.
you saw literaly everything the original game, theres nothing new to this.
accept the world

this game is not even a game so dont think its a game

it also sucks at being a tech demo aswell, since everything you see here has the same lighting affects the main game does"
2194,"what a shame that this was cut from the original game. since it was though they could have made it more expansive. i like it and feel like there could a stand alone game here but, it's just a single mission."
2195,Very Positive.
2196,Good. Recommend if you are new.
2197,"It's a short, but enjoyable experience. 10/10"
2198,"it good
"
2199,Should have been in Half-Life 2
2200,woah?

2203,"this demo thingy thing is gud

i cant belive that im saying this, i had a gud time even tho this demo is like 15 minutes long"
2204,this is a thing
2205,"now i know this was a cut level from hl2, but..... WHY IS IT ITS OWN GAME!?"
2206,I don't get it. Why does this exist? How did Gordon Freeman end up on the island? Also btw I trapped myself at the part where you destroy the helicopter because I think I shot an RPG at the helicopter earlier. Yeah so basically I had no idea what to do the whole 10 minuets of gameplay. Lol I'm not sure if this was free because I got it in a bundle with other valve games. It probably is free.
2207,"The AI was broken and enemies didnt actually fight back which was pretty boring, but letting the developers talk to the player and show how much they actually care about the game is dope."
2208,Very good level design. good for speedruns
2209,is nice
2210,"Nice, but short game."
2211,6/10.
2212,A fun bite sized Half-Life experience. Good for that one friend who isn't sure he'd enjoy the Half-Life games.
2213,This is a tech demo with optional commentary which is great to see/hear. Shooting things is also in this demo. For how old these titles are i'm amazed how well the water and light physics look.
2214,GABEN
2215,short but pretty good
2216,"- Can only explore a quarter of the map.
- Only 30 minutes of gameplay."
2217,When a 30 minute tech demo made years ago is literally better than half the games released years after
2218,Noice tech demo.
2219,It's better than nothing
2220,short sweet demo
2221,"It's uh, a HDR test.

It features a re-skinned gunship that was turned into a Combine heli.

Nothing really new, only thing that surprises me was that Gaben himself said something along the lines of ""We like your feedback.""

Uh-huh, whatever Valve.


I mean, if you want a ""fantastical boomtastical lastical adventure"" look the other way."
2222,"Nice short game for an impressive show-off of the HDR technology on Source.
The developer commentaries are interesting as well!

Try the game! And nice job to Valve."
2223,"Just a demo, not a real game
☆☆☆"
2224,Beautiful game
2225,"I didn't know this existed, but now I do. It's just a short little tech demo that came with Half-Life 2. Not much to say about it really. It's just cut content from the original game."
2226,This coast is so lost that it is still full of f#*kin' combines!
2227,"Despite it being a tech demo, it's still good."
2228,"I am a big fan of the half life series and I liked loved the original games, liked episode 1 and loved episode 2, but this was just unecessary. I get that it was made to demonstrate the first instance of high dynamic range rendering, but it should have been a free mod and not a payed dlc. It really felt pointless to me to be honest."
2229,"Interesting little tech demo for Valve.
I wouldn't really recommend it unless you're REALLY into Half Life 2 and want to see all the content ever produced for it. 
The tech is out of date now and exploration is rewarded with strange surrealistic vistas as you walk behind buildings, float under solid rocks, and jump through piers and bridges that look solid and totally aren't solid. 
The tech demo is designed to be played a very specific way, which is problematic when you don't see the path you're supposed to follow immediately. While my walk behind the post apocalyptic scenery was quite relaxing until I fell through what I thought was a solid object, I don't think I'll be playing it again, as I'm not super interested in the commentary track. It has virtually no replay value. It was designed as a showpiece for graphics and it remains as a relic of video game history, but not a particularly interesting one unless, like I said, you're REALLY into Half Life 2 and want to see all the content ever produced for it."
2230,Nyaaa~~
2231,Interesting commentary.
2232,It is sequel to show what developers have done in simple and an interesting way. Valve never seize to amaze.
2233,A great short level that fits in HL2
2234,"The closest thing to Ricochet 2 you'll get in 2019, I imagine. Only get it in the bundle; much cheaper there than standalone"
2235,Sexy demo
2236,what
2237,"good tech demo, to all those ratings demanding their money back or saying that its just a single level, this is just a tech demo, not a full game"
2238,Very short but very good.
2239,Want my money back
2240,"It's not even worth commenting on.  Really.  Oh, wait, I just did.  While I'm at it, this was included in a bundle.  I certainly would have DEMANDED my money back had I payed for it alone.  Just sayin'..........."
2241,"Voices do everything :D
I expect it to be a bit longer but it's just a demonstration by the valves to show us what it is capable of doing.
You can call it a game test to see how your game is running."
2242,Nice little bonus and pretty interesting.
2243,It's short and sweet
2244,Prob the first game to ever have raytracing... looks nice
2245,This shit is wierd bruh
2246,"Where's Half Life 3?
-10/10"
2247,"Not really a game, kind of a representation I guess. That ""game"" is just here to exist. I've ""completed"" it and I still dont understand what I've played."
2248,"I received this for free a long time ago and decided to play it after finishing Half Life 2 for the second time; the first time I finished it in the year of release.

It includes one level that takes place between two levels in the original game, it's purpose at the time was to display HDR and bloom effects. It's more of a showcase, if anything.

The level in itself is quite enjoyable, the graphics aged very well and it is packed with good ol' HL action as we know it. It is, as expected, rather short.

I wouldn't fork over at full price, but neither at a sale unless you really want to savour a bit more HL 2 in your life."
2249,"A fun little tech demo/cut Half-Life 2 level. Not really much to say. If you enjoy Half-Life 2 combat, then this is a short (no more than an hour depending on how quick or slow you take it) level to play through."
2250,Basically a 15 years old tech demo. I still can't get around how beautiful it is. Genuinely enjoyable visuals and scenery.
2251,i dont really know what to say about this one
2252,Its short but I like it.
2253,I can see why this was not added into the full game. It's still fun though.
2254,why people love this games?? they are designed with the ass
2255,tech demo
2256,"Half Life is an amazing series but Lost Coast didn't cut it for me. Alright, it's fun to play and I enjoy the gameplay. But there isn't really much to it and for me the game is over in minutes and really all there is to. So, the game deserves to be praised for its fun gameplay but is knocked down by the downsides."
2257,GG
2258,"A great, quick challenge if you turn it up to hard mode. Took me about 30 minutes to finish, so it's great if you just have time to kill. I definitely see why Valve scrapped it, it didn't feel like it added anything to the story. It is interesting to wonder how Valve could've improved on it though."
2259,"it's really impressive that this was made in 2005, it looks great. if you like half-life 2 and want just a little bit more it's definitely worth it, especially if you're also into game design and development."
2260,As long as all FPS games should be.
2261,cool if you want to learn how to play the game. its good
2262,Got it when bought hl2.
2263,good. 10/10
2264,What is that? This is just an extra level without story behind. OK OK you give a little punch to the headcrab invasion but thats all. Srsly not only waste of money but even waste of time.
2265,It was a short one but it was worth it!
2266,Short and sweet! It's a great taster for anyone who isn't sure if they'll like the full half life 2 game
2267,Kinda pretty looking. The machine part is tricky. Sort of.
2268,Pretty cool insight into some of Valve's development and it is playable.
2269,good and short benchmark for old PCs / Retro gaming
2270,yobama!!!
2271,Nice game
2272,"I always heard praise for HL2 and it's Episodes but this is bizarre. There is hardly any content, and this feels like a tutorial. Throughout the single, yes SINGLE, level there are bubbles you have to listen to that tell you boring technical stuff. This is what HL2 is supposed to be? You talk to some stupid farmer or something and some guy talks about his face the whole time and he says clone troopers and the SWAT team are in the fortress above. You go there and basically have free aim to kill anyone as long as you don't use a bubble.
You go the the castle and again do the same, there is a bunch of crappy paintings everywhere and the SWAT guys and stormtroopers attack you, and later a helicopter does. Confusing and stupid, a waste of your time."
2273,Yes
2274,"If this was alot bigger it would of turned out to be a great saga, as the start was really good."
2275,def yes coast
2276,10/10 need more
2277,Great example of the complete half life experience in a short hillside level.
2278,"Half Life is an Amazing Series but Lost Coast didn't cut it for me. Alright, it's fun to play and I enjoy the Gameplay. But there isn't really much to it and for me the Game is over in Minutes (My best Time is 5 Minutes) And really all there is to it is a Small 5-10 Minute Level."
2279,nice
2280,the coast has indeed been lost
2281,"I really like this tech demo. It's so good I can even call it a short game. Commentary is great, I just wish there were some programming showcases and stuff.


7/10"
2282,epic
2283,h
2284,Is Half-Life: 3 as lost as the Lost Coast?
2285,more half life
2286,"You can jump off a cliff after taking down an attack helicopter, 5/10"
2287,Best benchmark
2288,"It's nice to hear stuff about the game's development and the developer commentary makes the game more interesting as this is, a very short demo"
2289,men that hdr of hl2 is amazing but overall it was good gane
2290,Bruh life 3
2291,"Pretty short but, its free and can be completed in 10 minutes. No reason not to get it."
2292,"It was basically a short mission containing new graphics and explaining whatever. I honestly thought I was going to be exploring the lighthouse and town, which would hopefully take hours. I was disappointed when I found out you can do this under 15-40 min. The graphics were good though. I recommend this if you want to see a new type of graphics or whatever. But people, IT IS NOT A GAME."
2293,"Rather fun, and the commentary helps explain the hard work that went into this gem of a game"
2294,it was so short but sweet
2295,"Best Half life game of the bunch, i promise"
2296,Short but nice to enjoy. ;)
2297,HEH
2298,A bizarre relic from the forgotten past in which we had to pay for tech demos consisting of cut content from the parent game. What a weird timeline we live in.
2299,A short demo

2301,short but cool
2302,pretty good
2303,"Well, it's a bonus Half-Life 2 level, what's not to like?"
2304,We need more Half Life 2 beta content.
2305,woah
2306,More satisfying than Half-Life 3 could ever hope to be.
2307,cool
2308,Can't find the damn coast
2309,"It could have been longer, but I enjoyed what there was. Too bad it was scrapped from Highway 17."
2310,Greatest tech demo iv'e ever played
2311,"A solid distraction if you have half an hour to spare, plus the developer commentary is pretty interesting as well."
2312,love it
2313,"A tech demo, but well worth playing, for that little bit of extra Half-Life
"
2314,Very short DLC where you mostly shoot combine for 13 minutes.
2315,epic
2316,This is a really cool free part of Half-Life 2 and it gives a bit of inside on how HDR works and the way the valve team used to make their games.
2317,"More of a showcase than anything, but fun to play if you want to shoot some combine without having to play through Half-Life 2 all over again. (from the beginning at least)"

2319,This minigame for half life 2 is short but fun!
2320,Is it weird that I genuinely want to go to the leech feast?
2321,its just more half life. not a lot but its there i guess
2322,It alright.
2323,Just Naa  : (
2324,"The Part on the orthodox church was very poetic, really gave me goose bumps. Well Done to the team behind the development."
2325,Cool.
2326,Finally played it after having it in my library for years. I didn't realize it wasn't a full game but now I got  Half Life 2 on my wish list.
2327,greatness
2328,is good demo lol
2329,"So this was the first game registered to my Steam account according to my Spring Cleaning objectives. I'm not sure exactly how, but maybe I tried it out before registering my first actual Steam game, the Orange Box.

So I ended up trying this before Half-Life 2.

And funnily enough, I still haven't completed the actual game. But playing this is motivating me to finally do so.

I definitely remember trying this as a stress test on a school laptop. It...ran okay? I guess? But it let me know that maybe I could get some simple 3d on there to play during my college downtime. So I've got good memories of this, going through the level a few times and checking out the commentary.

So today? Actually, still fun to play! It's short, but it's HL2 alright. You get a good amount of the weapons to toy with, and the verticality of the first half is a pretty neat concept. The latter part, it's a bit more simplistic but still satisfying gunplay. And the commentary, while outdated, still gives a nice layman account into develops into HDR. And I like that.

I'd give it a try, just to see how far we've come. And see that HL2 is honestly still fun after all these years.

Now to *actually* get through the real game for once..."
2330,Want some behind the scenes look at how the source engine works? Well this map is for you.
2331,gg
2332,"This short showcase miniature level is better than Hunt Down The Freeman. But beware, on newer hardware there are more graphic glitches than on my first csgo map."
2333,A tech demo of days past.
2334,"Wish I had played this sooner, graphics are a bit dated now, & playing with commentary is a must"
2335,People don't understand this tech demo was released 14 years ago... this was next-gen insane back then. Obviously doesn't live up very well to today's standards but look how far we've come from it. Definitely worth a look back at how things improved piece by piece.
2336,guys if u swim to the bottom of the sea in the game you can play half life 3 u just have to wait 10 minutes in the water
2337,A good tech demo for Half-Life 2. Don't expect any real Half-Life 2 expansion pack. It's just a tech demo.
2338,"Good technology demo, I enjoyed audio comments."
2339,A modern masterpiece of video gaming.
2340,"Super short bonus mission, part of the HL2 package.

I didn't notice the HDR thing it was supposed to demonstrate, but anyway, the level is short."
2341,I'm pretty sure there's a hidden door in which you can play Half-Life 3.
2342,"better than the one i just reviewed. lost coast takes place on a geographical feature known as a coast, or shoreline. i know this because i am in a geography class at my highschool. if you dont get it i dont blame you, youre probably just not as smart as me lol"
2343,"[h1]Surprising amount of effort went into a Source demo from Valve with fun combat and eyecandy visuals.[/h1]
Unique props and models and very nice graphical attention with in-game developer commentary tracks explaining the very clever (for 2005) tricks they've done to make their Source engine look fabulous. Of course these tricks are now seen as a bit quaint and out of date but it's quite a good piece of history when you take in the fact that this was extremely impressive stuff compared to other titles released in 2005. I'd say give it a shot if you really really care about Half-Life and it's legendary and ahead of it's time engine."

2346,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
2347,no
2348,Don't waste money on this you can do this entire thing in Garry's Mod and it would be the same.

And i think this is the best spot on steam to confirm rumors.

I am just a regular player.

Dont get your hopes up.

Or maybe hope?"

6/10"
2352,Better than HUnt Down the freeman
2353,"a nice little demo into what hl2 is like, enjoyable strategic gameplay and good graphics."
2354,"Lost Coast is an amazing showcase of Valve's experimental technology that was never implemented into Half Life 2. It is a very short level, but there is some amazing and beautiful scenery to admire. I got it for free when I purchased Half Life 2, but I will not mark as received for free because I bought HL2. I recommend  you try it! 10/10"
2355,A pretty nice short dlc!
2356,It is nice
2357,omg graphic update to hop 2 emg wth good gaem
2358,Another version of 3D Mark !!!
2359,"Always fun to relive a beloved past-time game. The comments were interesting too if you had the time to listen/find each one. Although it was short... very short, the rendering was fun to see vs HL1"
2360,"Was just getting into this addon and it was over. I found it really awesome and would have loved to see it go on into a fullon addon, perhaps part 3.

Anyhow, it was fun to play even though it lasted 10 minutes"
2361,Better than HDTF.
2362,ummm make half life 3??????
2363,great and better than HDTF
2364,short but decent

2366,A great short game to play.
2367,"This is a 20-minute game. It takes 20 minutes to complete. It's a tech-demo, really. It doesn't advance the Half Life plot in any way.
Maybe back in the day this was impressive, but these days it's not worth anyone's time, let alone money."
2368,good
2369,"Too short but enjoyed all the time spent with this beautiful addition to the HalfLife series!

Great Story, Action and suspense!

If you own this, you already own HalfLife Two sooo yeaaaaaaaaa"
2370,It's really short...
2371,"Epicly Pretty for 2010 on mac

I don't know why I'm reviewing this like an actual game but I even made a video review for it lmao.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BxP6dPOKek&feature=youtu.be

[b]The Great:[/b]
++Half-Life 2 gameplay
++The optional in-game commentary nodes add interesting nerdy insights into the production and purpose of the demo
++It's free

+The new soundtrack is cool

[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]

[b]The Bad:[/b]
-The helicopter fights were overplayed in the original game, let alone the episodes, so structuring this around it too makes my ass bleed

[b]The Horrible:[/b]
--The whole purpose of the demo is to showcase their 'new' HDR technology, except HDR sucks and looks ugly
--You can finish it in less than 10 minutes

Sound: 8/10
Graphics: 6/10
Gameplay: 4/10
Content/Replayability: 0.5/10
Overall: 6/10

[b]Conclusion[/b]
It's a technology demo and it's free, so reviewing it like this is stupid, but I'm bored so here you go anyway."
2374,"i finished this game in 20 minutes, is it right?"
2375,"This game is a thrilling experience. I love the graphics and all the work you have put in. This is just like the other Half-Life games, just a bit improved. The gameplay is fun and i hope there is a Part 2 to this."
2376,It´s ok i guess :/
2377,Well it's a tech demo but still pretty enjoyable and fast 15 - 20 mins so why not give this a try if you still haven't?
2378,sometimes i dream about half life 3
2379,Nothing to do.  Literally only took 20 minutes and most was running around trying to figure out what to do
2380,It’s fun but what exactly is the purpose of it?
2381,"Really short, but I enjoyed the commentary, the location and the Fisherman was a neat character aswell."
2382,very good
2383,Its a good remake of a scraped HL2 chapter
2384,Nice little side mission for Half Life.
2385,First game to feature HDR
2386,Cool tech demo.
2387,"This is more of a demo of Half Life 2 based off a deleted section of a certain chapter of the full game. good 10 minute demo to check out if you haven't played Half Life 2 yet and want to know if it will run on your PC. (Despite how old this game is now, should work with almost any modern PC, unless you have a shitty laptop that overheats too easily. Lmao)"
2388,I don't even know how I got this but its more Half-Life 2 content so I'll recommend you play it.
2389,Rip lost coast
2390,cool game good graphics (please just release Half Life 3 or Episode 3 <3)
2391,love it
2392,Interesting little demo about the process to developing parts of a game. Worth the few minutes it takes to play through it. Make sure you turn the commentary on.
2393,10/5
2394,You can walk around and look at stuff so exciting. I got this with the Half Life bundle and never gave it much attention. But it looks pretty
2395,"16MIN gameplay ?
better than nothing"
2396,Nice.
2397,Why Did I Play this For 5 hours wtf
2398,Rating is do to Steam's change in the review system today. I will be giving all products on Steam a thumbs down in protest over the change.
2399,"An enjoyable map for halflife 2, showing off neat source engine features and improvements. It’s also the first instance of valve’s developer commentary mode, which I ABSOLUTELY love and am a big fan of. It’s also free if you’ve bought halflife 2, and who hasn’t, so why not give it a shot?"
2400,"Just a teaser, but I still died in it so it counts as a game."
2401,Dont buy. There is a reason this was cut from Half Life 2
2402,Wow cool
2403,"A short but interesting mini demo/doc about the half life 2 engine 

not much else to say really. 

i thought it was worth a look through, fun to see the thought process for certain factors in the game like lighting, puzzles, level design and event triggers

5/10 - insightful"
2404,"good
"
2405,"NOT actually a continuation of the episodes, but an interactive showcase of how valve made half life 2 and HDR"
2406,"Game is absolutely trash wasted all my money on this game and it was 15-20 min long. Basically you climb up a hill meet a drunk AF fisherman and he takes you on a trip that takes 13 seconds long and wastes time on finding his keys, you go up this random ass hill with absoulute no details at all, shoot like 7 soldiers with all those guns that they spawned in for you at the start . Then you go up to a church that actually have good details inside but shit outside. kill some people at the church, go outside and kill like 3 more, then you go up to this wooden platform and wait 20 seconds for a helicopter to arrive, you get another rocket launcher to take down the chopper, go down this shitty elevator which isn't even an elevator and end up at the start of the game again and meet this drunk fisherman again and he thank you with shitty quality mic.   Another GREAT game that makes you want to push yourself over the EDGE!"
2407,if you are intereseted to see how they developed hl2 this is for u
2408,Nice :)
2409,Better than Hunt down the Freeman
2410,Fisherman - the man that broke my heart. 10/10
2411,ummmmm.....
2412,"Very interesting background informations mosty about graphic issues that occured while creating HL2 (source engine) and how they solved them! Also about level design and AI with audio messages from Gaben and other people that had a major influence on the development. Don't expect a ""game"" ;)"
2413,"wow I definitlly see the graphical improovment 
I also did the commentary mode beacause I was really cerious and its really interasting 
how they devalope games like half life 

also do not eat the leaches (;"
2414,"Meh, almost good."
2415,"As short as this is i also enjoyed it, it might not be as good as some of the mods i've seen out there for this game but it's still a fun map"
2416,H M M
2417,An short stage but includes much essence of Half-life series.
2418,yes
2419,Cool Half-Life 2 demo
2420,"Hey, it's Half-Life 2 with somewhat updated graphics!"
2421,"From the perspective of an artist, this is a fascinating demo that gives you a brief insight into how video games are designed, and how many things are taken into account for that. The little lesson about level design on the monastery is especially very valuable for anyone that wants to make video games. Everything looks very pretty too, so it's even better =)"

2427,"I had ran across a Half-Life documentary online and I decided to play some of the series. I wasn't really sure where to begin, after having not played most of them, plus not having played through 1, 2, 2.1 and 2.2 within the last few years. I decided to fire up one that I hadn't played, which was this one, without knowing what it was. 

I went to settings and get everything primmed (I had to turn on mouse acceleration and set my native resolution.) For the heck of it, I put it on max, seeing as how Source engine is old enough that even a midrange laptop should be able to handle it beautifully. 

And it did. 

I clicked ""new game"" and was gestured to turn on the developer commentary. Seeing as how I had *just* watched a documentary, I decided that it would be a good idea to turn it on. I think that was the right choice. I stepped into the Lost Coast and was greeted with a beautiful landscape... and quirky floating conversation bubbles. Had you not read the dialogue box where you were asked to enable the commentary, you'd have no idea what to do, but hopefully one would have the natural instinct to interact with it (Use). 

They provide a delightful showcase on the engine and various components around it, seemingly only missing the audio-element - although maybe this was one of the 14 speech bubbles I missed. I'm fairly sure I got all of them, but there was no real way to tell. 

Without the commentary I think the game is about 20 minutes in length, and with it maybe 30. I was a little remiss, as if I'd known it were brief, I'd have not tried to cheese my way through the vertical level design. But then again... maybe that's the spirit of Half-Life. 

The elements themselves are all stellar. The level design, objectives they push you to do, and challenges the players faces are all highlighted in the commentary and it provides this amazing dialogue with the player and the game, and the player with themselves. Multiple times through the settings I would have dialogue with myself about the beaut- Oh FUCK COMBINE - Ahhh such a nice view from the cliffsid- Holy SHIT they can rappel?

I don't know how much I paid, but I've paid $60 for worse experiences so..."

2454,Here just for Graphics.
2455,It's a tech demo for 2005 tech. Only worth playing if you're researching old game developement or something.
2456,Fun...but short. I finished the entire story in 30 minutes. Best as just a side mission for hl2 main game.

2475,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a demo to showcase the abilities of the Source engine, mainly about HDR and other visiual improvements.

Pros:
-Looks nice
-You get to hear Gabe Newell's voice and obtain his email address for further feedback

Cons:
-You don't to get to have a feast with the fisherman"
2476,"It's a pretty cool sneak peek behind the scene on the in-game graphics. For example, to simulate the eyes gradual adaptation when suddenly exposing to bright light, the game constantly monitors the amount of light enters character's eyes. I didn't know there were so many aspects involved."
2477,"I love it. It's so short and sweet and even though it's not canon it still feels like it's part of the Half-Life universe. Too bad it's only a tech demo. It's an awesome little game, but I wish it had a more explanation or gameplay. I get that it's a tech demo. But they clearly put so much into the fisherman character that it'd be a shame if he didn't get more story or wasn't in HL3."
2478,"I wish there were more content like this. I really enjoyed seeing the background behind one of my favourite games...

(Steam did not register my offline playthrough, it is at least 30min of fun.)"

2504,"[h1] Review[/h1]

Lost Coast is an interestening idea. Its less of a level that didnt make it into the game and more an interactive development log of Half-Life 2. You find audio logs troughout the short level that explains various problems and idea the developers had. Its not just also a simple log because it offers also examples or an graph to go along with their explanation. This is while you have a very short level to play while killing enemies.

To the level itself while short offers probably one of the more interestening places in Half-Life 2. The setting is some sort of old english fisher village which looks really barren and supports the story that humans are dying out. 

In my opinion tough its an interestening idea only because the pacing is off. You start with tons of logs that you can click which are very long and midway trough the level there is a section where you dont see any of them. So its either wait and listen to them or run trough a part of the level without finding any. Well its not that long tough, the map itself will be finished without listening to the logs in about 6 minutes.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
I would even recommend this idea if the level would have been longer and the audio logs pacing would have been stretched so you dont just listen to somekind of podcast where you have to move on every couple of minutes to listen to the next audio log."
2505,i have more hours in this game then i should have
2506,"i like lost cost, cause you can chill and enjoi the hl2 graphics"
2507,Finished in 15 minutes including director commentaries. Why even bother to release this as standalone title???
2508,Better than Artifact.
2509,Nice
2510,y
2511,"Игра на 12 минут, которую я растянул на 30"
2512,8/10
2513,asd
2514,"You get this 10-minute demo for free, fortunately, so it's a nice way to spend 10 minutes of your time."
2515,To bad it's very short.
2516,1/10 Too Much Water
2517,"Great, short, and with more of what makes HL2 so fun."
2518,"That's good game, but it's so short."
2519,good game
2520,Awesome as an player the developer commentry gives us insights of the development team difficulties in the masterpieces they create.
2521,[u] Valve just showing off their [b]HDR skills[/b].[/u]
2522,The game is extremely short and if you like me play it straight after hours of HL2 it feels like a let down. It is however a free extra level so just go for it. Have fun for 15 min. Especially if it was some time ago you played HL2. The you might have fun for 25 min.
2523,Its a tech demo sooooo
2524,Nonsense.
2525,14 years later and this still looks amazing.

2527,"Very short, but it's always fun to step into the Half-Life world. Too bad they
never made Half-Life 3."
2528,"While officially included as part of the Half-Life 2 Collection Bundle, remove from your mind any thought of this small single map from being any fabled long-lost next chapter in the venerated-yet-perpetually-cliffhung Half-Life saga. Instead, prepare for a roughly thirty-minute-long guided tour along a more-or-less linear path through a bite-sized chunk of Half-Life lore (of dubious canonicity) in a beautifully designed Mediterranean monastery under the unfortunate control of the occupying Combine. 

Each and every facet of this short experience has been masterfully designed to showcase not only the technological aspirations of Valve’s in-house engine in bringing such locations to life, but also the thought process and methodology of the numerous developers, designers and artists that have worked on previous instalments in the esteemed Half-Life series.

Exorcise any expectations from your mind of pulse-pounding gameplay or Achievement hunting and take half an hour to immerse yourself in the breathtaking world presented within. A must-play for any true fan of the Half-Life franchise, or for anyone with aspirations to enter into the world of digital game design and creation.

Recommended."
2529,Just great!
2530,Longest game I've ever played.
2531,FPS Must Play. Just an awesome map.
2532,"Sweet demo. Although it's a demo to demonstrate source engine, I like it."
2533,This deserves to be the winner of the 'BEST ENVIRONMENT' Award.
2534,still waiting for half life 3
2535,its ight
2536,shoot
2537,Good to be back to Half'Life 2 as Gordon Freeman. Short episode but challenging enough in the hardest level. Worth the time.
2538,game of the year 2018
2539,Cool demo
2540,"This level was designed to benchmark the performance of gamer's PCs with the ""new"" source engine and Half Life 2 graphics. It's a very nice level which by my opinion should be found in the original game."
2541,For a free DLC its good.
2542,It works as great techdemo and benchmark.
2543,short story to pass some gaming time that ranks well.
2544,i always wondered where gabe newell spelling his name came from
2545,Way too generic and nothing like the original.
2546,it's not hl3
2547,Just get on a boat and go away
2548,Great twenty minutes of fun. Cool introduction to Half Life as well.
2549,"Literally just a shader and lighting showcase for HL2. If you see this for sale anywhere don't buy it, you can get it for free by drawing breath on planet Earth, I'm pretty sure."
2550,better than HL2 10/10 *would play again*
2551,No story. Just a test. I used it to see if my PC could handle Half life 2.
2552,Shows how realistic graphics can be even back in 2005
2553,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a technical demo released in 2005. It is added to every copy of Half-Life 2 on steam. The idea was to show HDR technology for the first time, of course now all of that is a standard but at least we get around 15 minutes of additional gameplay for free.

Story was originally meant to be a chapter from a base game but it was cut from unknown reasons. Gordon Freeman wakes up on a beach with his stuff, he meets an old fisherman who asks him to clear out the Combinate outpost nearby. Our protagonist climbs there eliminating enemies, facing one boss and listening to dev comments scattered around the map. Simple but acceptable side story in my opinion.
Gameplay does not change at all, Gordon still use the same gear, same weapons on the very same way that in Half-Life 2, the one and only change is that some of ways to achieve our goal might become unavailable if you are too slow. To clear the demo you must simply listen to all the commentary and proceed further. Boring but short enough to not make you sleep.
In terms of performance the only changed thing is the water and how it looks, all the graphics look exactly like in the base game so do not expect fireworks.

That is all, a short DLC-like chapter that is not any different from original, it is free so I guess there is nothing to complain about. It might have been a little a longer but to be honest no one cares. 7,5/10."
2554,"Short but great experience in the half life universe.
Loved it."
2555,"If you know what to do, you can complete the game in less than 1 min!! ;D it's a fun and very enjoyable game. Great voice acting work, interesting gameplay!! I've finished the game many times.. and I had so much fun, 10/10. ;D"
2556,Only one thing: What is this?
2557,"There isnt muvh i can say about this game baecause it only lasts 10 munuits or so, but what i did enjoy about it, was the fact that it was just action which i love"
2558,Very short
2559,"Lost Coast is a free introduction to Valve's HDR usage in the Source engine. It is short, is fun on hard difficulty, and, most of all, includes developer commentary on the game and it's effects. A great 30 minute game."
2560,i will keep miss Half - Life 3
2561,"I spent all these hours on this ""game"", I spent these hours on skips, now I can beat this game under 2 minutes, I skipped the entire church, the fisherman, even the elevator at the end, I spent all this time, I even got a pulse ball, there is one, I found out how to go to the other island, without the guide's way, you just rocket jump and the water does the rest for you, I found out how to make everything not do anything, atleast the ai, I found out how to go out of bounds, and under the map, I found out how to go to the main city, unlike the guide, all of this without cheats, this ""game"" is fun, and it is fun to speed run, and it is fun to break it, it is fun in general, it feels like a secret when you find a text box you never seen, it is fun to hang out at the other island, it is fun to skip things, it is fun to explore the map, even in intended ways, it is fun to rocket jump to the only combine elite, it is fun to ""win"" but you actually die, and it is fun to waste nearly a day's worth of hours in this game, and it is fun to play without breaking it, and it is fun making a review on it, and it is fun to wait to redownload it, it is now done, bye."
2562,"The demo is very good, It actually shows how the game works and how easy it is to explore certain buildings and areas."
2563,"this is a masterpiece
"
2564,The finest of wines in PC gaming. (bts)
2565,short level and pretty looking for its time. especially the church. its free and comes with some developer commentary.
2566,it has a nice way to explain the HDR (High Dyanamic Range) that they use and how it works
2567,"Pretty fun, but quite small! 
About half hour of gameplay"
2568,"OK so there is BIG PROBLEM

It says lost coast

But clearly there are enemies so that means they already found it

Therefore please call this game half life FOUND A COAST

Thanks hope you release half life coast 3 pretty soon"
2569,"It takes about 20 minutes and it's got some interesting (albeit dated) commentary. If you have time to spare and want a short excursion into the Half-Life universe, give it a try."
2570,"The best tech-demo I've ever played. Also, maybe the closest thing we'll get to Half-Life 3?"
2571,"This game popped up in my library for no reason and when i went to go see what it was, it was a buggy mess."
2572,I WANT MOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
2573,"I liked this version of half-life 2 - also - but ended up with the same difficulties I had with Half life 2 - I had problems getting around - in the physical world.  Maybe it was the 3rd person perspective, Not sure - But I do not play that type of game anymore (3rd person view).
I will once more still recommend this game - as It had good reviews at the time I bought it - and I cannot say it was bad - just because I had a hard time getting around in it."
2574,Fine addition to Highway 17.
2575,"It's a playable tech demo for the amazing new technology HDR.
(it was new at the time ok, give me a f*cking break you numbnuggets)

PROS:
- FREE
- You can hear the voice of your benevolent overlord G A B E  ""GABEN"" N E W E L L @valvesoftware.com

CONS:
- only 20 minutes long."
2576,"Hey it's just like a 20 minute demo.

If you wanna play 20 more minutes of the Half-Life 2 Coast levels then just get this lol.

Also yeah the lighting sure is great for 2005 good hdr stuff nice one valve good demo guys"
2577,This was actually pretty cool to see. Glad I got to.
2578,"Half-Life 2 Lost Coast is a free addition with the purchase of Half-Life 2. As the description of the game says, this is a playable tech demo showcasing HDR and such in Source. It is very short and is also cut content from HL2. The game was made to help Valve improve their games (mostly in terms of graphics) by players' feedback. This is kind of a good chance to see HDR in Source games back then. I recommend playing with commentary enabled. You could learn something. Of course, this is made in 2005, don't be giving feedback on this stuff in 2018 dum dums (I think I contradicted this statement by making this review haha)."
2579,Great
2580,"it was fun
"
2581,"Drink my sodas, they'll make you great, they'll getcha anything that you ever want, you get a girlfriend, you get some money, buy my soda, they'll make you healthy, they'll make your feet small and give you abs, my soda will make your breath smell nice!"
2582,"It's just a tech demo, what do you want from me?"
2583,"Cut content (originally) for HL2. Comes with purchase of HL2. Now, if you don't want HL2 but you're interested in buying this, you better give up that thought because it isn't worth it, at all - either buy HL2 and get the full experience, or nothing at all. This is a single map, designed to showcase things introduced to the Source engine between HL2 and Episode One, officially introduced in EP1.

It's a beautiful map, no doubt, and Viktor Antonov had a part in it, yet again, which is great. But just 'cause it's beautiful doesn't mean a single map is worth buying when you can get it for free if you buy the full game, which is inexpensive nowadays.
So, despite this being a positive review (because HL2 is good and so is Lost Coast at its heart), don't buy this! Just buy HL2 if you're interested in Lost Coast. Way more worth it."
2584,Very short but just as good as anything else in Half Life 2
2585,"Wow, that was short"
2586,Nice Updating of Graphics!
2587,It's pretty neat.
2588,"A small map created by valve, originally to showcase new Source Engine lighting techniques. Based off of cut Half-Life 2 content Saint Olga was actually supposed to take place around the cut Borealis chapter in the earlier versions of Half-Life 2. Despite its short length is worth playing at least once as the level of quality you do get for the short length is extremely high, the level design is on point and is very compelling to play the whole way through. Its also interesting to look at what is essentially Beta content reporpused and completed in such a way that you could almost see it being shoved in the retail game. Good stuff and its free so fuck it right? Might as well."
2589,wtf is this. Thanks for a short experience
2590,I guess it's good for those who want to play something Half-Life but don't have 2-5 hours to spare!
2591,"What's great about this game is that it's Half Life 2. What's also great, depending on who you are and what you think is great, is that this game takes about 30 minutes to play through completion. It can also be 1.5 hours long, if you're like me and couldn't figure out how to open a door for a long time, then remembered you just press E like all doors in game always.

After finishing Lost Coast, and then realizing I'd just finished it, because that was sudden and unexpected, I felt happy and sad, joyful to experience HL2 at all, confused because yes it really is that short and nothing in the title or beginning screen thing says ""Heads up guys, this here game is as long as one episode of M.A.S.H."" But it's fun. It's HL2. How could it not be?"
2592,"just a brief, BUT I HAVE FUN TO RAPE THE COMBINE SUCKERS"
2593,"Good short game or demo, but still its not HL3..."
2594,love u gaben skins pls (csgo)
2595,No
2596,For a short demo game I say this was actually pretty neat! Right as the story starts your welcome into the combat portion of the game which is cool. So I have to give this a 7/10
2597,"It's a tech demo! 

About 15 minutes worth of gameplay or maybe more if you become stuck at certain parts.

P.S. Shoot the seagulls!

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
2598,Tech demo that has a higher entertainment value than HDTF.
2599,50 reviews
2600,"Hahaha.
Okay. First of all this ""game"" is actually longer than I thought because of other people saying how short it is. It is interesting and it really shows what Source engine is capable of. Basically this is Source engine and Half-Life 2 gameplay in a nutshell. I'm one of the biggest Half-Life fans and Lost Coast is cool level in my opinion. I would recommend it to every Half-Life fan or amateur or basically anyone else. I know it's short but for a short map i love it."
2601,awesome game!
2602,Nice little side-adventure. Wonderful place. Enjoyable.
2603,"Nice. Short, but nice.
10 mins of gameplay max."
2604,its good.
2605,"Boring, it's just 15 minutes of shooting. Don't worry, your life is complete even without this tech demo. It's not impressive in 2018 and adds nothing to original games."
2606,Gaben ASMR.
2607,***1/4
2608,"Half Life 2: One of the best games I've ever played. 
Lost Coast: 'That's it?'

It took me less than an hour to finish it (it logged 2 hours because I walked away from my computer, bored). Very disappointed to say the least. They tease you with tons of background scenery - which made me think there was MUCH more to the level than it turned out to be. The gameplay is identical, but it's just WAY TOO SHORT! Very anti-climactic. Glad it was part of a bundle so at least I can play HL2 again. This product should have been 'lost' in the planning stage."
2609,"It’s A Good 7 Minutes Of Your Life,I Like This Game"
2610,"This DLC is actually a game commentary about how the developers designed their game. It's nice to know, kind of an interactive ""making of documentary"" of the game. Recommended for those of you who are interested in game design or want to hear the developers talk and explain a bit. About 20 minutes long."
2611,"For 2004-2005, these HDR graphics are amazing!"
2612,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a cut map from Half-Life 2 that ended up being brought back with some developer commentary and showcases HDR.
Gameplay 10/10 (A fun map with a small boss fight at the end along with some intresting developer notes.)
Graphics 10/10 (Half-Life 2 graphics.)
Bugs 10/10 (None.)

This is just a cut map that was brought back to show off HDR and give you some intresting notes from the devs. You get this free with HL2 anyway."
2613,"It's pretty short but pretty good
Not HL3 tho ;_;"
2614,A nice place to visit during VACation.
2615,Remember this is basically a glorified tech demo. so dont spend money on this if you're expecting more half life 2 story
2616,Just a tech demo really with not a lot going on but I love half life and will play anything the series brings out. If you are a mega fan of half life then you will still enjoy it.
2617,Half Life 2: Lost Coast is a short representation of the Source engines High Dynamic Range lighting.
2618,Nice but short half-life episode.
2619,"A very, very short level expansion for Half Life 2. 

Thats basically the whole game, just a small level that takes place during HL2. Lucky, this comes with HL2 so its not a huge negative that its really short."
2620,"Not bad as a tech demo. Does not add or subtract much, and there is really not much to say about it. Can be completed in 15 minutes or less."
2621,"really short and easy but really good at most points some imo better than half life 1 AND IT'S FREE this game takes a nice amount of time so if you are at or finished highway 17 chapter from half life 2 play this and continue the game (i wish this was a dlc addon so you could do this inside the main game
"
2622,"Just a single level out of half life 2, it's fun."
2623,"Half-Life 2: Lost Demo. One level, some guns, some baddies. Eh. Nothing wrong with this one except that it's super short. Sub 30 minutes of gameplay on this one. Probably considered a video game in some cultures. All in all pretty meh, but if you want a bite sized sample of the real product, here you go."
2624,Its a new content
2625,"wait. 

why am i reviewing this?

its like a test or something

kinda cool"
2626,"It's a nice tech demo, that's all I can say."
2627,"I know that this is free with Half Life 2 and all but literally all you do is go up a cliffside, go in church, kill a gunship and some Combine, go down with an elevator and boom, the end! I am not finding this acceptable if it's a demo because it was released almost 15 years ago (2005) so why not do anything with it Valve? Just don't give this for free instead of dissapointing players! *sigh* Well, not as bad as hunt down the guy who screwed your face
PS: Doom II Master Levels did a free and whole different game along with Doom II, why didn't this?"
2628,Couldn't run it
2629,I LOVE IT!!!!! Please Valve make more of these.
2630,Yes
2631,"it was interesting to play, please continue with this :)"
2632,"Lost Coast is a single short map for Half Life 2. It was very fun to play. When I started the game, I saw that the map looked to be very big. It takes place on a coast, perhaps an island, being controled by the Combine Army. It looked to be a very big map because you can see a village close by. Unfortunately, the map turns out to be very short, the ending was abrupt, and plays no vital part to the Half Life story. I feel it wasn't long enough, and the map isn't as long as it seemed to be at first. It came with Half Life 2 when I bought the Orange Box, but I wouldn't reccomend buying it by itself. I'm disappointed by how short it is."
2633,half life 3 tho
2634,Ah HL2 of any game is one of the best ever produced.  This one was short and sweet.  I really liked how it showed off what was possible graphically when it first came out.  A taste of HL2 EP1 and EP2.  If you can get it try it.
2635,Great for tech nerds or people interested in how half-life 2 was developed. Note that it is quite short.
2636,"It's a waste of time and is like 5 minutes long
"
2637,+rep
2638,"Short, but fun!"
2639,cool game if you like fps games ;)
2640,"Game recieved for free, it was a gift from a friend.
[spoiler]wait a minute, this game is free for everyone that owns hl2, right? how did he give this to me as a gift? I'm so confused[/spoiler]
It's really cool to see the stuff they have to say about the levels, and i kinda learned what bloom was and that i should always turn it on. It's also just a fun level, i'm not sure why they cut it from the game.

[spoiler]hey there's a secret weapon to dick around with[/spoiler]"
2641,short but good
2642,This mod/game is very fun i hope the devs can make a chapter 2 for the next mission the gamelay was amazing and the graphics were nice and the setting was Beautiful
2643,"Its so sad to see this chapter got cut from original game, Its actually really confusing, but so fun to play at the same time. Also I don't know why, but for a reason Fisher's model is so fucking beautiful, like its so detailed and my eyes were blessed while looking at him, damn."
2644,Better then Hunt Down the Freeman (My friend has 200 hours on it)
2645,"I was pretty frustrated about this Half-Life 2 game a long while back ago and so I reviewed it as ""it was hard as fuck, stay away from this game."" Yet, it appears that me not knowing what to do in this game was the problem itself.

I don't know what I was thinking when reviewing that even though I was a kid and had my frustrations on stuff. I was frustrated at this game so if you're going to be the same just watch out, it might cause you frustration. Unless you know what you're doing then I recommend it to you.

I am sure it is a normal Half-Life 2 game and nothing that hard.. That I think..."
2646,Suprisingly nice
2647,The scenery was beautiful and even though it was short it was very fun to play and I liked the small but interesting area it took place in.
2648,Thumbs Up.
2649,"ok, but MAN this is a great tech demo"
2650,Fun Tech Demo
2651,"This demo is so good that I really wish its content was in the final version of Half-Life 2.
Sadly, developers had no idea when or how to implement it into the story so they just scrap the idea and turn it into a demo."
2652,no
2653,10/10 would wake up on an island again
2654,.
2655,👍
2656,Good game.
2657," A nice short piece of deleted content, looks gorgeous for 2004 and my only criticism is that there is a little bit of glitchiness near the end when you are finishing off the game as there are a few problems with the lighting and there being no texture for being in water"
2658,"Although this installment is more of a demonstration of technology, there is actual gameplay, with weapons.  There's really nothing new here in terms of combat.. The lighting and texture is the key-note.  Total run-time is roughly 30-35mins, assuming you take the time and listen to the commentary (which is actually pretty interesting).  

The objective is to disarm a heavy cannon located inside a monastery on top of a hill that is terrorizing a nearby village.  Along the way you'll fight some combine, head-crabs and a final boss (which I'll leave as a surprise)."
2659,"[b]DO[/b] [u]NOT[/u] [b]ENTER THE WATER, I REPEAT, DO[/b] [u]NOT[/u] [b]ENTER THE WATER[/B]"
2660,"It's just a tiny 15-minute tech demo to show off Source's then-new HDR rendering. It looked amazing at the time and still looks nice today, but don't expect much in the way of unique gameplay."
2661,That fisherman lookin good
2662,"It took me less than 15 minutes to beat the whole thing.  I believe it was the original Half-Life 2 demo.  It isn't bad and I think when you buy Half-Life, it comes free.  Not really a bad or good game I guess."
2663,"If you have Half-Life 2, you'll get this product for free. The game is short, but hey. It's Half-Life."
2664,This Half-Life tech demo is better than Hunt Down the Freeman.
2665,Short tech demo included with half life 2.
2666,Good Game! - [3/10]
2667,Great little addition to help with the Half Life itch.  Looking forward to the Project Borealis complete of HL3.
2668,sh1t this was really cool to play 10-10
2669,Makes me wet
2670,Too long and hard I was struggling to beat the guys. Half life 2 was the best but this is garbage. I was expecting a five minute game not a 15 minute.
2671,"This game was too hard, probably harder than dark souls. I wouldn't reccomend if you have anger issues."
2672,"its not a story just a kind of small mission the game can be ended in less than 30 min 
graphics 8/10
gameplay 8/10
happy old man 10/10 XD
(FOR NEW PEOPLE DONT GO TO THE WATER) :)))
and enjoy <3"
2673,THIS REALLY IS THE DARK SOULS OF TECH DEMOS
2674,A nice little bonus for a wonderful game!
2675,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is not about gameplay, but the creating of Half-Life 2.There you can learn a lot of stuff about Half-Life 2's engine."
2676,Yet another Classic
2677,"Took me half an hour to complete this game, still good though."
2678,a short fun game that is like a demo for half life 2. I think it would be better if you can get it directly for free as a demo or something
2679,"Experience HDR before it was cool....

On a serious note, a fairly straightforward level which takes about fifteen minutes to finish. It's worth installing the Lost Coast  to experience the developer commentaries and witness the beautifully crafted coastline."
2680,"truly amazing 100/1 gameplay
except there is no gameplay
its a techdemo people
why are you even reading this review you got it for free"
2681,yeah
2682,"It's very short, but pretty fun."
2683,"15 minutes of additional Half-Life 2 gameplay. It's just ONE area with nothing too special about it, but it's free, right? If you already have HL2, JUST PLAY IT! ...and if you don't, then it's not worth buying just for this free DLC. lol

This should have been a part of Half-Life 2: Update (if not the original HL2), but it is not for unknown reasons. And since it is a standalone game you have to set up the game again because it's not sharing any settings with HL2 and in my case started with suspiciously low graphic settings and resolution (and setting it up is half of the gameplay time in this case... lol).

Also, it is too dated to be an interesting tech demo nowadays."
2684,So this was a tech demo? Because it was well done.
2685,It lasts 20min. Thats all.
2686,Nice tech demo. I fell asleep with it one and got 10 hours
2687,1337
2688,"Took me 13 mins to beat, so yeah its nothing special. Shame, heard such strange things about it all in the past."
2689,Beautiful and Short
2690,"Meh, I finished it at least."
2691,"Noice

2692,"I enjoyed this more than any of the other versions, I just wish there were more to it, way to short and there could have been more story line.  Visuals in this one are stunning and immersive."
2693,"A wonderfull game/chapter i wish there was more but i still loved it
10/10
Short but sweet"
2694,"Love this level, it's really creative. I'm blown away at this. Would of loved to experience more of the town."
2695,A nice little playable documentry into game design for half-life 2
2696,the best hlaf lfie game
2697,So Apparently I can write review for this game....
2698,It would of been nice if they added this to Half-Life 2.
2699,"Sometimes, when I miss HL2, I load this up and play it instead. It's short and sweet, and really takes you on a great adventure without any messing around. The battles are exciting, and the environment is gorgeous.

Just make sure you play this at some point, if you own it."
2700,"It's just an extra level to HL2. If that's what you want, here it is."
2701,15 minute demo... somehow is light years better than Hunt Down The Freeman
2702,"What is HL2: Lost Coast ?

Its just a built tech-demo level to test new lightning functions, thats all. 

Theres no reason to play this."
2703,"Playing this game in 2018 - especially the ""stress test"" - is kind of adorable. It's amazing how far technology has come since this benchmark was taxing and difficult to run.

Short and sweet, get it in a bundle."
2704,"This would have been a fantastic addition to the beachy areas of the main Half-Life 2 story. I can really see this going somewhere around New Little Odessa, I just feel like it would've been great there, since NLO is clearly a fully human-inhabited area. Lost Coast is not a full-fledged playing area, it's more like a ""sketch"" of something that could've been in the game. I really do like it, despite the fact it is so short. It's only good the first time, and maybe the second time if you want to go explore the rest of the area if you're a curious person like I am. I finished all these things within maybe an hour or two, if you take away the length of time I got stuck in a certain area, the way to leave said area was not apparent to me. I cannot be mad about that though, as I said before, this is pretty much just a rough idea of what this area was supposed to be. [spoiler] I really enjoyed the church part, the fight there is the main attraction of Lost Coast.[/spoiler] I'm going to give it a thumbs up/recommendation, but I really just feel neutral about Lost Coast."
2705,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a technical demo released in 2005. It is added to every copy of Half-Life 2 on steam. The idea was to show HDR technology for the first time, of course now all of that is a standard but at least we get around 15 minutes of additional gameplay for free.

Story was originally meant to be a chapter from a base game but it was cut from unknown reasons. Gordon Freeman wakes up on a beach with his stuff, he meets an old fisherman who asks him to clear out the Combinate outpost nearby. Our protagonist climbs there eliminating enemies, facing one boss and listening to dev comments scattered around the map. Simple but acceptable side story in my opinion.
Gameplay does not change at all, Gordon still use the same gear, same weapons on the very same way that in Half-Life 2, the one and only change is that some of ways to achieve our goal might become unavailable if you are too slow. To clear the demo you must simply listen to all the commentary and proceed further. Boring but short enough to not make you sleep.
In terms of performance the only changed thing is the water and how it looks, all the graphics look exactly like in the base game so do not expect fireworks.

That is all, a short DLC-like chapter that is not any different from original, it is free so I guess there is nothing to complain about. It might have been a little a longer but to be honest no one cares. 7,5/10."
2706,Half Life 2 Lost Coast is a short chapter of the Half Life series with documentary from the developers while you play. The developers explain the process they take to develop a game like the Half life series. It is very short but fun to hear the thought process behind the developers. Definitely recommend if you like the Half Life series. It doesn't take up much of your time.
2707,"Could have been a nice, longer game. 

10/10 would complete in 0.5 miliseconds again."
2708,"It really is a lost coast.

5/10"
2709,A good demo but a very short game.
2710,Interesting
2711,Literally the first game I ever played.  Back when I was around 10 and played it on my friend's dad's computer with said friend.  I thought it was a damn horror game at the time cause of the damn headcrabs lmao.
2712,"When this came out... WOW... Nice Playable Technology Demo!!
HL2, Yes!"
2713,"A great game that show us what the developers of half life were thinking when they were doing the game, a great oportunity to see how almost the conceptual staff of a video game works, recommended 7/10"
2714,1 little chapter that you can finish in 30 minutes tops.
2715,jews
2716,"Lost Coast is a tech demo of sort. It shows off Half-Life's game engine aka Source engine with developer commentary, if chosed to. You can also stress test your pc. I got this in a Half-Life 2 bundle and I think thats the only way to get it. I'm not gonna rate it as I usually do but I do recommend it, since you can stress test your pc and the developer commentary is interesting to listen to.

Recommended."
2717,Really nice demonstration of the HDR and the game making process
2718,"I spent 3 hours tonight looking for a FPS Multi-player game that wasn't free to play and pay to win or just an excuse to give me crates in the hope I bought keys.

I found this in my inventory and played it again.  I had more fun with this than I've had with PUBG or any other game for that matter in a few weeks and it is just a tech demo of the possibilities of an old engine.

If anyone knows of a good FPS multiplayer without a crate/key system that is popular right now let me know because I'm sick of this free to play but not really way of trying to rob gamers of constant money or worse, get kids into gambling."
2719,I wish more companys made little demos like these...
2720,"An interesting tech fest short but sweet.
Insight into Valve's ways and eye candy so 1337.
Commentary telling you how effects work.
Worth the download for tech nerds; infomation lurks!"
2721,"[h1][b]not good, not bad. only buy if it is on sale[/b][/h1]

2722,"I wanted to make this review short and sweet, but it's hard to stop writing, even when excluding facts that could potentially contaminate an exceptionally well thought-out gaming experience. There's just so much to say. Half-Life 2 is, simply put, the best single-player shooter ever released for the PC. It does so many things right in so many ways that it might be possible to write a thesis on the topic of Half-Life 2 compared to other single player shooters. What Valve has created is simply a masterpiece -- a work of art in the genre. Not only does it engage the mind with mysterious happenings, vagaries, and mostly intelligent dialogue, but also captures the senses with a superb visual style made possible by brilliant technology. And once the initial shock of it all wears off and it becomes possible to peel back the polished layers of sight and sound, there is an excellent shooter here. Half-Life 2 doesn't do anything particularly new; it doesn't really innovate in many ways. But what it does is set a new height for all other designers of first-person shooters to reach. It still isn't exactly perfect, but it's about as close as I've seen in my tenure here.

Before I really get into the review, you should know the background of how this game was reviewed. Valve did not want to send out copies of their game (for fairly obvious reasons) before it was released to the public. In order to play the game, I, and several of my colleagues throughout the industry, took a trip up to Seattle to visit Valve in order to have some private time with the title. I was given a little room to myself where I could close the door, turn off the lights, click my little red slippers, and pretend that I was sitting at home. It worked for the most part, largely because I was so engrossed with the game that when I came out of my trance I often had to take a moment to get my bearings. Obviously, Valve was happy to bring me into a controlled environment for ideal playing conditions."
2723,󠀡
2724,best tech demo of all time 10/10
2725,"Half-Life 2:Lost Coast is about a deleted scene of Half Life 2. There are pre-recordings of Valve employees working on the Source engine and what they were trying to shape the Source Engine into. I recommend this game to anyone who is a big fan of the Half-Life series, likes video game documentaries, and wants to know information regarding the source engine.

P.S. This Video Game Documentary comes free with Orange Box."
2726,"better than hunt down the freeman




its just a short fun tech demo that comes free with half life 2 I believe"
2727,A nice quick game which highlights the game mechanics of Half-Life 2.
2728,This game confirmed half life 3
2729,Would've been a great addition to an already perfect game. Play if just because it's an extention of Half Life 2. 10/10 is there any other score?
2730,Major thumbs up. I haven't played HL2 for years. I went back and played Lost Coast for the 2018 spring cleaning Steam event and realized I had never played through this little demo before. I was more excited playing this than i have been on a lot of modern big name titles. I miss HL. When is HL3 coming!?
2731,I love this little tech demo. I especially appreciated Gaben's speech. Revisited this 'game' to get the Steam Spring Cleaning badge. Worth it.
2732,Did you know that you can visit distant town here? No cheats required :)
2733,finally i heard Gaben's voice :P
2734,"a short, cool, cinematic story"
2735,"Started this up again for the Steam spring challenges, or whatever they're called. Am still wondering why they never released Episode 3. 
"
2736,"great 15 min fun.
"
2737,Short but good!
2738,"This is a 10-15 minute section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2 that was cut for some reason.
Released as a seperate tech demo this showcases what Source Engine 24 could do at the time. There is a very nice commentary mode which when enabled will give you interactive speech bubbles in the game. There is audio of Valve employee's explaing the various technologies they had to develop to get the visuals they wanted in-game at different points. Explinations of their High Dynamic Range developments feature heavily and are very well showcased in-engine live for the player."
2739,Rad.
2740,nice
2741,"I remember being blown away by this tech demo all those years ago. I just loaded it up today as part of the Spring Cleaning promo on Steam and I have to say it still looks impressive, now where is HL3?"
2742,"Short game,Nice game.5/10"
2743,WTF
2744,good
2745,nigga why are there no POC racist af
2746,nice
2747,Sexy Light in anus!
2748,Best 45 seconds of my life besides my first time having sex
2749,[h1]GORDAN[/h1]
2750,"A musthave for a Half-Life fanboy :D
Score; 8/10"
2751,A cute and fun little addition to the HL2 series. I recommend playing through it if you loved HL2 like I did. I recommend listening to the developer commentary to appreciate it even more. I'll play through it again on a harder difficulty the next time I play through HL2 again.
2752,If this is all of what HL2 is 1 short mission then I don't understand why everyone calls this best game of its time.
2753,"I beat it in 17 minutes. Not worth any money, but worth 17 minutes of your time."
2754,"i commented to write this review, i dont want to play this game cause i know i will love it and want more and i will never get more."
2755,"All my Coasts, Lost"
2756,"Quick and pretty good.

9/10"
2757,Only .4 hours but I'd play it again
2758,"Fun, but short. But still worth it."
2759,"As you know, this is a tech demo which was supposed to show of the Source engine. If you played HL2 you won't get anything new. Just a nostalgic reminder of the game. There's no story, no nothing. Just the setting is really nice. It's fine, but I have no idea why it's on Steam, to be honest"
2760,Beautiful demonstration of the engine
2761,Short 10 - 15 minute demo and a good insight into the Half Life 2 universe!
2762,"good game would definitely recommend, nostalgic also 2013-2014"
2763,So this is how Half Life 3 looks like
2764,"It's Fun but, Too Short"
2765,:D
2766,its alright
2767,"Well... so you're all done and descending back to the beach on that platform and suddenly it speeds up and falls on the rocks, leaving you prone with only 1 hp left.
Hello again, Gordon - says the old man, - as you, i'm pretty sure, are totally out of guess, I'm Nihilanth. You see, i can't be completely killed, i kept on existing,  in an invisible energy form. Until i found the way into your world  and got control over this poor old bastard. Yeah, he's quite rusty. Besides i can't make those funny sparks fly out of his chump despite all effort made. Still, he proved good enough for pulling off dirty tricks, like this plan to lure you in here by a chance to blast that damn Combine big ass gun and then hit your ass against the rocks so i could finish the job in a slow painful way. But Breen contacted me before i started working on it and we made a deal. So i'm selling you off to your former administrator and his brand new host body's ass is already on its way here. Through a portal i managed to create out of old scrap i found in my own host body's barn. It's a very slow portal, due to the awfully poor quality of the materials i made it of and it's gonna take Breen an hour or two to arrive.  And until that very moment you're going to suffer. Trust me, i'll take good care of that. And start off right now with kicking you on the kidneys while telling you what i'm about to do next. And i'm about to get my remaining troops here through the bigger portal i'm already constructing from the same old refrigerators, TVs, car engines and toilets. All those funny mobs from Zen, you remember. Except for them treacherous standard vortigaunt units.
Suddenly, after another kick on the kidneys you hear smth break somewhere high above and then the rain of supply crates with medkits, batteries and ammo lands upon you, breaking open and getting you full up on all stuff(there's also a 25% probability you will be finished off by a rock or plank before you're healed and need to restart).
And then Breen shows up in a form of Councelor. ""Damn! I'm still learning to control this clunky thing"" - he says - ""hit my ass against some stuff up there while landing. Hey, Gordon! I'm taking you with me, i've got a nice plan on how i'm about to kill you"".
""So, when are you going to send troops to help me take back my legacy, as it was agreed upon?""- Nihilanth asks.
""Never""- says Breen - ""I lied, - ""And there's nothing you can do about that, dude. Not as an old invalid human you currently are and you'll never get any better option as you could only take over a targeted person while moving from your world into this one"".
Here Nihilanth cries out ""Damn you, lier!"" and suddenly hits Breen with his crutch on the probosis he was teasing him with.  Breen  squeaks and lifts him up in the air, immobilizing.
That's where player gets control of Gordon again and...
Damn, why am i not a mod-maker xDD
PS Lost Coast is just a tiny lost page of the world of HL2. Worth being seen.  Pity it wasn't added to the game though."
2768,"It's a nice little adage to the series we all know and love. They didn't put it into the final HL2 game, but I think for good reason. HL2 is already long enough as it is. This mission takes only about 2hrs, and has some finicky areas, but BOY is it pretty. No wonder they turned it into an FPS showcase. Its aim is to showcase things now, and it does so beautifully."
2769,"As its description pointed precisely, this is a cut content from Half-Life 2. Gordon Freeman would take a detour to help the local people fighting the Combines. Basically all you have to do is to go to the church killing all the enemies on the way, then returning to the start point. It is worth to appreciate the visuals, the verticality of the level design, and especially the HDR technology in its beginnings; there are also developers' commentaries with additional insight about this content."
2770,Fun enjoyable romp in hl2 VERY! very short though.
2771,"This is a short little DLC both used for enjoyment, knowledge, utility and more. It really could be longer, but it also has good graphics.  Also, we get more Half Life 2.

10/10 (self-explanatory)"
2772,"every time i read the name i think of gta san andreaS
LOST COAST should a mission or something
xd"
2773,GG
2774,"You need a quick HL game? This one is for you. Wanna do a speedrun? Yes, of course. In depth story? NOPE.

C.C.'s verdict: C- for ""Co QuiCk"" (so quick)"
2775,"Boi, i got this shit for free, my nigga!
Thumbs up my boi!"
2776,easy took 8 minutes to finish
2777,"this was a great way of showing the community what the developers were doing vurrently, its too bad we didnt get more of this"
2778,psst free TVs
2779,"Amazing demo, defenetally recommended by me."
2780,Been in my Librabry for a while. Thought I'd play it. Short but fun.
2781,"good,but not perfect......................"
2782,a fun side mission that comes with the purchase of half life 2.
2783,"Could've been a bit longer, 20 minutes is fine but at first i was expecting a long level like one of those travel levels. It also could've had more tasks to do or more puzzles to solve but all in all its a cool little addition if youve played all the half lifes and are looking for something fresh. 
8/10 
I gave it 2 extra points because it came with Half-Life 2"
2784,Just a really short demo as they used to be in the old days. It is just 1 level and is finished in 15 min. If you did not got it for free I would not pay for it.
2785,It's short.Shorter than I expected but since It's a demo I liked how It looked like.
2786,I love this game. It seems to have better graphics than Half Life 2. It takes about 10 minutes to complete but was so much fun trying out hacks and glitches in the game. I highly reccomend 9/10. I received this product from the Orange Box.
2787,Beautiful and fun level.
2788,idk
2789,A nice way to showcase how HDR works with nice commentary
2790,"Excelent test level explaining how the engine HL2 is built in works.

Don't buy standalone, but good nonetheless"
2791,"Stop complaining, its not a game its a demo/prototype."
2792,quick and fun
2793,"It might have its outside the box challanges, This game Is very boring. It takes about 20 minutes to complete. I only completed the whole game ONCE."
2794,"l like how they cut this beta version of what Half-Life 2 was originally going to be, but I don't think this should cost money. When I bought Left 4 Dead 2, it gave me the Beta version of that game. Should have been applied with Lost Coast as well."
2795,It's just a playable tech demo but it's still pretty enjoyable 15 minutes of gameplay with interesting developer commentary by Valve.
2796,It's great to see a playable version of something was Originally planned for Half-Life 2 but extremely short. I would only recommend if you want to see more of Half-Life 2. As for myself I just play and complete because I have always wanted to play since beating Half-Life 2 on Xbox.
2797,Good
2798,"I should not have 77.9 hours of playing this.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiugajUxwU0&t=3s


p.s. 
Lost Coast came out on my birthday."
2799,I mean I got this for free with the second game and it was more fun to play than Half Life 1 so there's that
2800,boob
2801,This Sucks who cares About its Engine and all that its a TOTAL Waste Of money Dont get it
2802,"It's just a cut out chunk of Half Life 2 with better lighting. I don't know why they cut it out because it's really good to play and would have fit in really well with the game. 

But for the love of god, don't buy this separately because it comes free with the game."
2803,"A cool, little and quick playthrough of an awesome looking map"
2804,"A very nice 30 min journey in the HL2 universe!!!
10/10"
2805,Boring
2806,It's short and sweet
2807,"I kinda wish it wasn't cut, especially after being finished, but at least it can be played and appreciate."
2808,help im lost
2809,cant find it
2810,Easy Speedrun
2811,"A theoretical physicist goes to church, but it's an uphill struggle for him."
2812,"Played it after playing [i]the Passing[/i] and [i]the Sacrifice.[/i] Good to hear Bill's voice actor again, it's kinda like he came back.

[b]R.I.P. William Overbeck[/b]"
2813,Its just a neat little tech demo that includes a deleted level from HL2. Its just 20 minutes of fun. Some of the effects were a big deal in 2005.
2814,Half-Life 2 Lost Coast is a great game for learning the controls and physics.
2815,Was a fun little map and I did have a lot of fun first playing it
2816,cool tech demo valve
2817,Valve has zero intrest in making a Half life 3
2818,It's a nice tech demo and a cool little map to play.
2819,"Why was it original planned to be in the final game but didn't make it?
I don't see the point of cutting a fun little ten minute segment.
Should've been in the final game, Though I guess we where atleast lucky enough to get it at all."
2820,yes
2821,this is the episode where jery steals cable and the cops murder him
2822,9/10
2823,"Sometimes I come back to this game and just shoot some combines. I dont know why the fuck am I doing this but.. It feels good :DDD
I would give this level(because it has only 1 level) a 9.1/10, It looks good and you should try it as an ""demo"" of Half Life 2 games."
2824,"it's short but and i expected more, but still, that was pretty good."
2825,This is a short game with a short story and short gameplay. This review is also a short one.
2826,Marvelous Level.
2827,Completed in 43 seconds. #speedrun
2828,So far this game is SOOO much better then the first one. Even without the commentary its easy to appreciate the amount of work that went into this. I'm pretty excited to try the second one now.
2829,really short took me 11 minuts fun tho
2830,very short; 20 min short.. but still worth the download
2831,"This is actually Half-Life 3, but none of you even played this when you installed Half-Life 2, did you?"
2832,like and subscribe
2833,Very short and nice :) 15-20 min joy
2834,I could not find the Krabby Patty Secret Formula.
2835,This game is so fucking stupid the helicopter is invincible I fight it for 10 minutes straight and it just wont die. Then I see people completing the game under 2 minutes like wtf your a hacker.
2836,This Game Does Showcase how Valve Created the church but sadly it was just a DLC? Or a extra content but its really good
2837,its a fun little halflife 2 demo and i cant stop playing it!!!
2838,"Short, but try it if you bought it with Orange box."
2839,"Buy it. 

Play it.

Love it.


Played it countless times on all computers.


Worth the money.

Epic and fun.

Its Half-life Lost Cost."
2840,extremely buggy. you can escape the world very easily and if you fall down and die at the end with the carrt thingy the fishman still talks about how you did it. Littterally unplayable. valvr is just horrible
2841,nonono
2842,"This is so damn short, in fact, I completed it in under an hour, but it's still loads of fun like Downfall ;). This is a little scenario where you must vanquish the terror of St. Olga, a persistent Headcrab Canister Launcher implemented by the Combine. There are a good few Combine soldiers to fight through, as well as beautiful environments, great level design and a hunter chopper. Thumbs up here :D."
2843,Pros: Great game and Good graphics. Nice story line.  Cons: too short. Almost 13 years old. Hopefully it's expanded and upgraded soon.
2844,I liked it it was interesting to get to learn about Valves development process in this video game 10/10
2845,fun now its boring
2846,Completed in 43 seconds. #speedrun
2847,"One of those 'can't believe I still haven't played this' kind of deals. But don't fret, it is literally just a cut Half Life 2 chapter that takes about 15 minutes to finish and has all your favourite HL mechanics and features on display - cliffside walks, physics, headcrabs, more physics and a helicopter battle. Indeed, had this been left in, it probably would've been one of the shortest chapters in the original game. 

People have said it makes for a cool fevre dream-style moment for Dr Freeman in the canon, going by the ending. Said it's best to load up after you get the crossbow for the first time. Been a while since I played HL2 but when I replay it (and will probably be soon because I need my good FPS fix now and then like a favourite chocolate bar) I'll make sure to splice it in with the main game. 

9/10 (only because it's Half Life, was free and should be counted as part of HL2 itself) 

"
2848,"The shiny water is pretty.

This is not a long game. Someone looking for a continuation of Half-Life 2 is going to be disappointed. Lost Coast is just an interesting look at what the Source engine is capable of."
2849,"Paid $10 for this game, i didn't realize it was only one level?
Otherwise, it was great."
2850,Better then hunt down the freeman.
2851,that was fun i like it
2852,5/10
2853,"Lost Coast, while short, is a very fun little map.

It looks good, it's one of the first instances I remember seeing HDR in a game, and the developer commentary is a delight to listen to if you're into that.

The Half-Life 2 series is one of those games which largely fails to become outdated owing to the high detail textures and models and solid, classic gameplay.

Lost Coast is no exception."
2854,"Honestly, I have no idea why I got this game. It is a good challenge, but is extremely buggy, and it's real reason is to tell you how Valve produced Half-Life 2. It has a game- breaking glitch right at the start where if you go onto the rocks behind the gate into the cliffside, the fisherman won't open the gate. I honestly don't recommend it, but if you are a Half- Life superfan, go ahead, waste your money."
2855,"Amazing long gameplay of 10 minutes! That's equivalant to thinking about how your life went wrong while 600,000 milliseconds of your life gone past or watching one pyrocynical video."
2856,"It's free so...

3/10"
2857,"Tech Demo/10

Explains HDR stuff nicely with some examples.

Provides Gaben lines for meme use."
2858,Green zone
2859,Pretty cool!
2860,"The graphics has advanced, I would really love to see Half-Life 3"

2862,.
2863,good
2864,👍
2865,Good thing. It's too small but for bonus knowledge its good.
2866,"A technology demonstration showing the Source Engine in Half-Life 2.
"
2867,"Desperate for a HL2 fix? Sadly, ""Lost Coast"" can't scratch that itch. In fact, it'll only make it worse. It will give you 15 or so minutes of great fun and serve as a reminder for why we're so sad that we'll never see Episode 3. It's especially teasing, given that it's... you know... on a coast.

What's fantastic about ""Lost Coast"" is the developer commentary. Seriously, it's kind of neat to hear the thoughts of the devs on an incomplete level. SInce it's free and you can make multiple playthroughs in less than a hour, why not take a look?"
2868,Good graphics test if you think your computer can't run half life
2869,"To say I was disappointed would not be far from the truth. Once the fight starts, you think, all right, where will this take us? Only to realize that that single fight up the hill and in the site is the ONLY fight in the game and, really, the only part of this game. If it never was added to the original half-life 2, it was because it had nothing to add to the story and we never should have received it. Great art as always but terribly short with no true satisfaction to gain from playing it."
2870,"I mean it is free and shows how far ahead of the times Half-Life 2 was in terms of lighting and texturing. Not a lot too it, some walking, some fighting, a little fun. Mostly a tech demo."
2871,"short af, wish it'd be longer."
2872,It is good but very short only 20min
2873,very great game but it is very short
2874,"A nice short 10-20 minute Demo with a 2 combine fights and a fairly easy heli fight, turn on the comentry to understand the new graphics system, and see what the developers have to say, useful also if your interseted in developing, they explain Arenas, and other gamplay mechanics, with the comentry on, i found this as an educational but fun demo that can be played multipule times."
2875,"It is considered to be standalone game here, so I review it as a standalone game. And as a standalone game it is bad, it is boring and way too short even for 1 level."
2876,"Im not sure how to get to the next chapter, please help"
2877,"awesome

btw got it because of hl2 ep 1 :P"
2878,Best for challenge with friends.
2879,good tech demo for the time. graphics still look pretty good
2880,high replay value
2881,short but a great demo for half life 2. introduced valve technology. it's pretty good looking for a 2005 game :p
2882,"I don't need new car or  a new house, I'm not materialistic... But Half-Life 2: Lost Coast got me good."
2883,I would of prefferd this over route 17
2884,"don't expect a full new game 
just a tech showcare , still interesting though 
and also has an FPS test feature"
2885,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is essentially a deleted scene from Half-Life 2 that has been remastered with additional graphical flourishes. Though the game is disconnected from the larger narrative of the Half-Life series, it offers a tasty morsel of exciting, action-packed gameplay with a climactic showdown.

Lost Coast takes place in the same Eastern European milieu as Half-Life 2. The environment is beautifully rendered with lots of tantalizing background detail. The centerpiece of the game is a beautifully rendered Eastern Orthodox church.

Lost Coast also marks the debut of Valve's director commentary series. While not essential, it is interesting to hear to thought process that went into the design of the game.

It's a great snippet of gameplay, and it's probably already in your Steam library. Play it."
2886,I am a few years late But I Love the game with the developer commentary in it! 10/10 would half life again
2887,"the game is just georgous, and if they are, i can see why half life 3 is taking a while, which i can respect and it make me more excited just for it to come out, heck i might be an old man and i'll still be waiting on this game with a smile on my face, but Valve, keep doing what your doing and again kudos the game looks amazing! :)"
2888,It looks good. I hate churches. Upside: it's half an hour long.
2889,Even the demos are good
2890,half life 3
2891,the half life dlc
2892,Fun and short
2893,"Useful technology showcase for Source Engine and HL2 Series. 
Despite its year, awesome graphics and physics. 
You can play before HL2."
2894,feels good man
2895,"Short and sweet. 

What this game has:
The fun gameplay you may recall from the Half-Life series (it's a H-L game of course lol)
For 2005 standards, great visuals.
A fun setpiece towards the end.

Overall, a good timewaster to play over and over again while you're waiting for a game to install, or waiting for your new computer to arrive (true story :P)."
2896,"how to download

"
2897,Pretty neat demo
2898,This is fun to play and learn about
2899,Not lost at all
2900,"Probably the most unplayed game on Steam, lol. With the commentary on, it's actually rather interesting. You also get Gaben's email!"
2901,I was entertained for 10 minutes.
2902,the sequel to hlallf life 2 epidose 2 blew my head off. aldough it is only 10 minutes long the sory is wirth it. u play as paul newman whose dog recently died. liike all cool games main hero has no voice  but the coiol spirite of dooggo which haunts paulie is voiced by the brilian voice actre gaybe freewell. brilliant game ...
2903,It's nice
2904,HALF-LIFE 2 LOST COAST...Low cost!
2905,pretty fun but not what i expected.
2906,too short
2907,this is a tech demo lol. stop complaining.
2908,"Really short, but not bad."
2909,A fun 20-minute game everyone seems to forget. Play it between HL and HL ep.1 !
2910,"This game is the kind of misc titles of a franchise that is only recommended to play as a fanboy, not as one who seeks for fun.
Still cool though."
2911,How tf did I get 4 hours on this demo?
2912,"it gets pretty boring. but, since it's free and you can get it by buying half life 2, it does nothing wrong."
2913,Short game took me less than an hour to beat it. It is pretty fun for the size of the game. Overall 9/10
2914,"It's 15 minutes long, so"
2915,Nice mission.
2916,"A simple, one mission addon to Half Life 2 that showcases the graphics, sounds, and level design that were used to create the game. Turning on the commentary in-game will allow the user to hear about what was put in for Half Life 2 to look the way it did then and now. I recommend it for anyone that wants some quick fun or for educational use, besides... it's free for all Half Life 2 owners."
2917,nice bonus
2918,"I bought this game with the Orange Box while it was on sale, I did not realize this came with it..


I don't like this game. Really, I don't.

This is why,

-The game lasts 10-15 minutes. (Look up a video if you don't believe me!)
-The story is pointless
-Should have never been made
-An old fisherman at the end calls you a 'Fuzzy' (whatever that's supposed to mean..)"
2919,"Year Released: 2005
Year First Played: 2007
On What?: Xbox 360

It's 15 minutes long, so."
2920,"Just a cool little tech demo with some audio commentary and demonstrations. It's fun if you're into that sort of thing.

Hell, it's better than actually playing through the level with that weird weapon change system, enemies blindly charging at you and at the same time taking 3 shotgun blasts or about a gajillion SMG bullets each to die on normal difficulty. First time you die it becomes a challenge of ""how to kill 10 guys in a row with 25 health and nowhere to hide"" :D

6/10"
2921,good
2922,"That's very wreid, but it's not bad."
2923,"Good game with good engine, just 1 map, but MAAAAAAAN THIS IS HALF-LIFE!

"
2924,Didn't learned of this LC chapter until recently. If you are interested on Half-Life games design or game design at all buy Half-Life 2 on sale for 0.99€ to even play this first in normal walktrough and then with commentaries on.
2925,cool
2926,"a good add on for people who wanted more good out of half-life, makes a pretty good game!"
2927,"Nice demo, I wonder why they removed it from the original game :/"
2928,f
2929,"A short demo of Half-Life 2 series showing the HDR technology implemented into the Source engine. Pretty good 15 minutes of gameplay.

2930,These graphics get the Ralph Seal of Approval. Amazing !!
2931,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast basically is a Source Engine tech demo. The sky, the sea, the buildings and other structures, the landscape environments, the lightnings and so on are spectacular, you shall see deep potentials of it very quickly. The gameplay also reminds you of Half-life 1 with memorable weapons in new looks such as crowbar, pistol, shotgun, etc; the unusual paths like narrow edge on the mountain along the hidden spots with supplies, a physics that we all love and hate, a puzzle that you need to solve, to find a way to advance further... then realize you are back to the first place because it's a loop. After all, it is a pretty impressive demo.
.
Except one thing - All of it was a lie!
.
The more you look at it, the more you get angry when Half-Life 2 main game looks nothing like this. All it has to give you is a City 17 with a super tall tower to make you go ""Wooaah!"", then it immediately flushes you away with very mediocre and linear map designs, especially Water Hazards and Highway 17 level. The only second ""Woaah!"" you will get is near the end of game when inside the tower Citadel, sadly it is just a cable car ride, you play nothing. In summary, ""Big however bland and empty"" is the correct discription of the main game, so don't expect to get on complicated paths map like Half-life 1 nor expecting any big details map like Lost Coast. I will say it again, all of the tech demo was a lie! 
.
Still don't believe it? In the teaser pictures, do you see the beautiful town over there? Also the factory near it? Well keep seeing because that is the only thing you can do - seeing - because you don't/not allowed to go there. The only way you can get there is by following guide that ultilizes the glitches or similar like that, or just simply noclip toward it, but even if you do, there is nothing, no events, no enemies, no objectives, nothing at all. 
.
What you actually play in Lost Coast is > Speak to the old man > Wait for old man to open the gate > Killing Combine while on the way to Church > Disable the Missiles in the Church > Defend and take down two choppers > Get down > Talk to the old man > End of it, just like how this review will end here
.
Thanks Valve
RIP Episode 3 and HL3"
2932,This game is fantastic.
2933,"Short, but sweet. Just how I like my women."
2934,took me way too long to figure out that this is a tech demo
2935,"Free tech demo for the owners of half life 2, yeah, it's good"
2936,"this game is very intresting
and a fun addictive map"
2937,its a short game tbh
2938,Fun expansion but really short.
2939,"""...""
- Gordon Freeman"
2940,I finished it within a minute. I think it was showing a new engine of half life sequel. I like the graphics and also this game is quite light especially on low spec computer. overall this game just for showcase of new source engine. keep it up
2941,"i beat the game in 2 minutes about 3 years ago but i had to leave it running for a bit just so i could make a review
i had a good joke planned but i dont remember it"
2942,"A lost chapter and tech demo, it's short, but loads of fun to play. When I'm running through Half-Life 2, I usually open this up around the coastal chapters. It's free, it's fun, play it."
2943,"If you wanna really complete the entire Half Life series, get this. Other than that, it's short and not needed so you can skip it if you want."
2944,hlf 3 pls :(((
2945,"Small demonstration, I wish they made more of these."
2946,A small little taster for hl2's new at the time High dynamic range graphics and features commentary from the devs worth a look into if you've purchased the game
2947,Good demonstation game.
2948,"it was good
"
2949,man half life 3 sucks
2950,"I think that this free game comes with Half-Life 2. It was pretty short, but i liked it. 7/10"
2951,"This is a complimentary expansion pack you get if you have Half-Life 2. Lost Coast was a level that eventually did not get integrated into the story of Half-Life. Instead, it is used to showcase the Source engine's capabilities with particular emphasis on its HDR effect. 

The level takes place at a coastal location and, similarly to the main game, our task is to proceed and eliminate all the Combine forces. Our best bet is to turn on the commentary mode which allows us to launch audio logs with the developers from time to time by clicking on commentary nodes along the way. Short, factual, thumbs-up!"
2952,"An experiement by VALVe to highlight their design choices, and technology in form of a scrapped level for the Half-Life 2 campaign. The gameplay is nothing very special, of course there's a reason the level was scrapped, but the attention to detail is insane, and the developers commentary is nothing short of profound and insightful. If you've played through Half-Life 2 and episodes before, give this game a try, it's so familiar but yet so different at the same time. Much too short to give a formal score, but definitely worth your money.



trythisgame/100"
2953,Nahhhhh ITs not that very interesting
2954,"It's a half-life ""game"", can't dislike. I fought some combines, 3 poison headcrabs and a chopper in less than 15 min, not bad."
2955,"i didn't liked this game.
doesn't have more maps"
2956,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast

It is a small tech demo which includes some commentary. 

"
2957,"Backlog review, going back to the games I loved the hell out of, or hated, and played pirated copies back in the day or legit ones.

Interesting HL2 episode, er, demo, suggested."
2958,"A quick deleted bit from HL2, not bad, could have been left in.  8/10"
2959,"I bought this as part of the Fall sale in the Half Life Bundle, and why it probably sucks as a standalone it does offer up the same physics-defying sci-fi action that defined the series, with a few graphical improvements. It really is only worth your time if you buy it packaged with the game, but it delivers so well that it is a welcome addition to an outstanding game."
2960,Its just a tech demo but it's amazing.
2961,Gd utility
2962,this is a awsome game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2963,as close to hl3 as it can get
2964,"Half an hour long tech demo that comes free with your Half-Life 2 game.
Quite ok with commentary from developers."
2965,Is a little chapter or a demo.If you what to try half-life.
2966,its short but still half life
2967,what
2968,its very good you download half-life 2 and you have this for free
2969,"It's pretty cool, and it feels free so yeah."
2970,2005 how the fuck does it look so good
2971,Who needs player clips when you're having this much fun!
2972,"really short, but still cool to find out about some of the development process for HL2"
2973,"good bad 

good
this mini map game was made to show of the texture and possiblity of tech addvancment in graphics and detail and for 2005 when this was added to steam it really does show the amazing detail for its time period even to this day ... theres a grate little battle and story in the game

bad
sooo the only thing thats bad is that this game isnt long enough i love the detail and the game play but i just wish it was longer 

id reccomend people buy or try this game"
2974,"It's a test. What else needs to be said? The commentary is pretty interesting, though."
2975,The purpose of Lost Coast is to showcase new graphics. Also it looks cool. Only if it's 2005 now.
2976,"I, eh, hope you like Leeches."
2977,engaging short game!
2978,Half-Life 3 Canceled
2979,Half-Life 3? xDD
2980,"[i]Lost Coast[/i] stands out for its length. It's very short. Your mission is to get up to a church and take out a gun that launches headcrab-filled pods inland. It gives us another glimpse into the world of [i]Half-Life 2[/i] in an environment that gives a better sense of how things were before the war. The fishing village atmosphere and the church give the sense of timeless stability, where most of the main game felt more burdened by a long occupation. Definitely worth the time it will take to download."
2981,A bit more challenging than the rest of the game. Fun.
2982,Demo
2983,1 word... beautiful
2984,pretty good if you have time to kill when you're bored
2985,"A pleasant little sandbox, and quite informative as well. I'd reccommend this to any who wish to learn more about graphic and virtual mechanics."
2986,A nice little addon.
2987,"Instead of ‘Lost Coast’ it could have been called the ‘Lost Chapter’, feels like something that was cut out of the original game. It feels and plays like the HL2 you know and love, it’s just so very, very short.

We all want more Half Life, right? Well this is 10 minutes more of it.

Works well on SteamOS/Linux, streams to the Link without issues and has perfect Steam Controller support."
2988,whats the point of this
2989,"Wow... I think windows mixed reality is the next move in VR! No sensors to set up. I was skeptical how it would work w steam and so far its awesome. 
Runnin a GS43 MSI laptop w 1060 6gb card and using the Dell MR. I could packup my gear and play anywhere!"
2990,ummmm.... wat
2991,"Heh. Turns out the coast is actually [spoiler]not all that lost after all but I went ahead and saved it anyway[/spoiler], boss!"
2992,I got a rocket launcher in under 20 minutes. 10/10
2993,A-
2994,"short, fun, and FREE!"
2995,Great game!!
2996,A quite simple playthrough for Half Life. Not super difficult but not really easy. Awesome game!
2997,"Great tech demo, and great commentary."
2998,Good game
2999,"Short little HL 2 cut level, it's good- I mean it's Half-Life 2."
3000,"Small tech demo with some commentary. Not a complete game in any way, but hey, it's a good listen and doesn't actually cost 40 bucks. Get the Half-Life Bundle."
3001,"first off its not dlc like i thought but its almost better, its just a 25 min long side game with commentary and insight on the making off Half Life 2. Its worth a try."
3002,Good
3003,Good game
3004,It's like sopha's near and you're little foot finger.
3005,TOO short
3006,"I like the use of this new engine and I think it works well. I also like the commentary explaining and demonstrating the engine. My only pet peeve with this is it is too short, I mean i get that it's supposed to be a test for a new engine but it is still REALLY short. I'd also like it if you released HAlf-life 3 already. Also RIP Robert Guillaume."
3007,"This fisherman will get you talking about leeches
10 /10"
3008,"It's nothing special, you won't be blown away by it, but since it's free... it may be worth your 0.5 hour.

Don't expect anything - it's like playing through a normal HL2 level (with semi-interesting dev commentary)."
3009,you are warner bros and you are on a journey to discover how to make new films instead of remaking already exhausted movies/content idk
3010,Still better than Half-Life 3
3011,Just a little level that comes for free with Half-life 2. It's enjoyable and very short. Works as Half-life 2 does.
3012,"I can't enable Steam overlay on Mac OS Sierra 10.12.6. It has been 4 months since I've started playing Half-Life games and I was able take 3 screenshots, only during one session. I hate you for not giving a single fuck about Half-Life anymore, but this is different. Your own application doesn't work on your most valuable game series, well done."
3013,"nice tech demo, had a lot of fun"
3014,FREEE!!!!!!
3015,couldn't really tell graphics improvements
3016,"Just a tech demo, i think"

10/10"
3021,dank
3022,"Quite a decent tech demo(?) actually, a shame that it was not built upon in terms of storytelling and the general location itself which gives me some serious Beyond Good & Evil vibes! :)"
3023,its cool
3024,‏‏‏‏
3025,What even is this episode? I guess it's a Demo for HL2 Source Engine
3026,"If you like half-life i guess you should play this.







































































idk"
3027,its good
3028,If the story can be longer...
3029,Good for practice and showing off with Source.
3030,Too short! But I'll take all the extra HL2 content I can get I guess.
3031,the manga was better 3/5
3032,Fuck the fisherman
3033,"Even tough I can't finish the map by myself. I had to consult a guide, because I got lost in the church. I would like if it was actually included in the main campaign of HL2."
3034,"I finished this game so fast, that it doesn't even make sense for a review lmao."
3035,i somehow have 18+ hours in this one segment 5min map
3036,omg so good
3037,"That fisherman is way too chill about everything.
"
3038,It could be longer its not the best game but its a fun half life good game for free :)
3039,"I really enjoyed this game, i would have hoped that this game would have been a little bit longer, but it's okay.
Also the game wasn't that hard so i didn't struggle at all. I recommend.
7/10"
3040,Its actually pretty good if your a fan of half-life and and have 30 minutes to kill
3041,"i don't know why it's called lost coast
i found it"
3042,Fun level and an excellent showcase of technology. A bit short though.
3043,"No story just a little gameplay with a short fight. Basically a Source engine tech demo for the then new HDR system. Worth playing through if you are a ""completionist"" type or just carving for some Half-Life stuff."
3044,lol you can load half life 2 maps in this game
3045,Rise and shine mister fishman
3046,"ThIs HlAf LiFf thRE?

3048,you can get away with anything if you are good looking enough
3049,"This is pretty much the closest we'll get to half-life 3, so.... it good"
3050,"Yeah, I recommend this for some odd reason."
3051,Episode 3
3052,"this game is the ultimate half life.

play this if you like
-immersive fps gameplay
-lovable, memerable characters
-insane dialogue
-a LONG campain (it takes forever to beat)
-great voice acting
-life like physics

I would give this a 100/10, but to be more formal

10/10 Masterpiece"
3053,This is a tech demo from valve. fun to play i guess when you are really desperete for episode 3... but hey it's fun for speedrunning as i completed it in 10 minutes.
3054,"It's a 20 minute tech demo with some Half Life 2 gameplay and optional commentary.  Don't need to play it for Half-Life's story since it doesn't add anything, but no reason to not play it."
3055,"While it's free, it feels rushed. I've played through it TWICE! The tech it's supposed to demo also appears in HL2 itself, which is pretty egh. 

The voice acting is kind of good, but used instead of some kind of closing Gman outro. 

The level design is kind of nice, though. If they made it longer, I'd like it more"
3056,"HALF-LIFE 2: LOST COAST

Lost coast is a rare occurance where deleted content is made playable for fan pleasure. This 20 minute interactive deleted scene would have taken place between the chapter Highway 17 and Sandtraps of Half-life 2 but was cut for probably time reasons. The scene features a combine headcrab canister deployment station to sabotage and a gunship fight. It also was intended to be much longer than whats available and was to feature the bullsquids from the first half-life.

PROS:
-Not many definitive pros other than the novelty of playing deleted content.
-Free to play/bundled with half-life.

CONS:
-Oh so very very short. Playing casually feels like a speed run.
-Wasn't in the final product dispite how well put together it was.

Pure gmod textures and not for a bad reason. This isn't really the kind of game to keep around after playing because of its length and complete abcense of content. It's unfinished, unpolished, and even outdated content so thats all to be expected. Its usually bundled with half-life for free and even then i think its just free in general. All in all it's still worth a look.

8 creepy fishermen of 10

Next up is Half-life 2: Episode 1"
3057,"It's an ok 15-30 minute game, I guess"
3058,This is Half-Life 3.
3059,I found it
3060,Shorter than my penis
3061,Just watch it on Youtube. Do not buy it. It is not worth it.
3062,"It's hard to argue that free things are not value for money.  If you want 20 minutes of [b]Half-Life 2[/b] gameplay, this will give you that.  It [i]is[/i] fun, for as long as it lasts."
3063,Just some good fum. not much to say.
3064,Excellent game.
3065,"Hands down, best Half-Life game. 12/10 would climb up a mountain and shoot down a chopper again."
3066,"Love this short Game, Starts and runs well on Windows 7-64 with the GTX 1080 Video Card."
3067,"If you are wondering what inspired MGS: Ground Zeroes, this is it."
3068,"This is the greatest half life game in the series. You don't need to play halflife to get into the story. Grafics are amazing, and the fisherman is the best character to ever exist in any game.
10/10 would buy again
Game of the year"
3069,"It's nice to play a little bit more on Half Life 2 here. It's not long to play, it's really really short. Plus, it has commentary"
3070,its.. GOOD
3071,WE WANT HALF LIFE 3 NOT A FUCKING CARD GAME
3072,It's a fun half hour one off level. It shows off vertical shooting. It so short there is not much to say.
3073,"It's a tech-demo for HDR.

10/10 closest we'll ever get to HL3.
edit: man this review aged badly lmao"
3074,"I absolutely love the half life series and all the games, I recommend every single one of the games but am extremely disappointed in valve. The complete lack of ANY communication for TEN YEARS is completly disgusting, It is disrepectful to the fans who supported valve for years. Its sad that valve doesnt even have the courtesy to tell their fans that half life is dead. It is clear that we will never get a satisfying ending to an amazing story. I personally am not interested in anything valve has released since Episode 2, and if the single player story driven masterpieces of recent years are anything to go by, its that valve only cares about its games as service titles, and not their narative driven campaigns. I am deeply upset that we will never get to explore the atmospheric and exciting universe of half life again. Valve prides themselves on their independance and flat workplace structure, but its clear there is a lack of focus. Valve, like too many companies in the video games industry, seem to be too blinded on following the money, they have left behind those that got them there in the first place..."

3076,funny memes asside this is actually pretty useful for testing your performance with the source engine
3077,"A pretty enjoyable Tech Demo. Even though it is short, it is still a fun bonus Half-Life 2 Experience."
3078,"Beautiful!
It's not a real game, but a demo. It has a little bit fighting and commentery from developers. Graphics are nice."

3080,"as a single level, it's pretty darn good. Unfortunately there wasn't more to it


"
3081,It's just an engine demo so... yeah there's not a lot to say. It's definitely fun! Just know that this is more of an opportunity to hear from the devs than it is to play more of Half Life 2.
3082,nice
3083,People should really look at the release date more often

3091,"Lost Coast is a short game with some interesting developer commentaries. If you get a chance, try venturing into the water!"
3092,This isn't even a game. But it's fun.
3093,"You want Half-Life 3? Then do this:

- Don't pay for microtransactions in any game like TF2, CS:GO or Dota 2

- Don't buy Steam Trading Cards

- If you want, don't sell your cards either

- Actually, don't buy or sell anything from the Community Market

- If you want an item from a game, use the original trading and not the market

- Don't craft badges with the trading cards

- Don't buy games on Steam just for the trading cards

- Buy Half-Life games"

3098,Hl2: Lost ep 3
3099,This is actually the best Half-Life game.

3102,Excellent game.
3103,Excellent.
3104,Like it!
3105,play artifact haHAA
3106,I mean I guess it's ok. Not much to say about it. It's not HL3 so yea.
3107,"OK, THIS HALF LIFE GAME IS NOT IN THE MAIN STORY LINE. 
This is a half life game to show the potencial of the source engine. Its really good if you want to know about the engine.
It has some gameplay but its not connected with the main HL story.
If you enjoy knowing about source engine, then yes i recommend."
3108,Not the Half-Life 3 we wanted but the one we... uhhh... just make it already.
3109,More Please....
3110,"Its cool, its like one of those many combine ambushes from hl2 ecxept for free and has cool graphics!"
3111,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a tech demo, for about 20 minutes of gameplay. I enjoyed it for what it is, with its great graphics and commentaries by the developers including Gabe Newell."
3112,very pointless pretty and fun
3113,Nice free addition for those wanting more from Half-Life 2. No reason not to download it. There is a commentary by the developers as well.
3114,"A beautiful presentation for the Source Engine's capability for lighting, textures, and shading. This was a really cool experience. Some nice gameplay also, and some cool insight into how Valve does their stuff. Really cool."
3115,"Please note: My play time is not accurate because I played through this apparently before Steam tracked play time.

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a free, playable tech demo that is basically just a Half-Life 2 level that isn't in the main game. It's very short and can be completed in a few minutes. I recommend it because I had a nice time with it, it was free, and it didn't take up a lot of my time. These are all pros in my book."
3116,"The Lost Coast is a bite-sized portion of beautiful Half-Life gameplay. The world and obstacles are built in a way that feels natural, making it a joy to explore and figure out.

This mission took a while to download, so I only wish it were longer <3

You can enable developer commentary, but I definitely recommend you save that for a second playthrough. It's interesting, but I enjoyed it more by first playing the mission at my regular pace."
3117,Really a fun experience. It's very short though as its cut content from hl2. Fun if you enjoy half life and want to squeeze a little more enjoyment out of it
3118,you can beat it in the time it takes me to take a shit
3119,"It's a nice day at the beach. And then you have to fix a lighthouse and people in masks start shooting you.

Is it worth it?
















Eh Sure go for it kiddo"
3125,This is only an additional level for the 2004 FPS Half-Life 2 to demonstrate the high-dynamic-range rendering implemented in the Source engine. Is this a Half-Life 3 teaser? I am sure we will find out one day...

3127,developer commentary
3128,Buy this game for Gmod
3129,"It's cool to see the developers comentary and a cut chapter of Half-Life 2 fully fleshed.

It's not much, it's actually very short but it delivers what it promises.

9/10 gives a different point of view on the game."
3130,"Well , I see This vesion of half life with this tech is so cool , but some places are so dark that you cant see just with flashlight , otherwise it's pretty good !"

CONS: THE FISHERMAN ISN'T FEMALE"
3147,It's a good quality for something that is so sort.
3148,Half life lost coast 2 pls
3149,"Short, sweet, but just what I needed to distract from some persistent headweasels before going to sleep. Easy to immerse in and out of, with the same appealing graphics and setting as the main game."
3150,It's a good test for a computer's graphics and general preformance. Would recommend for PC benchmarking.
3151,"This is my fifth time finishing a Half-Life game. Review Half-Life 2: Lost Coast? There really isn’t much to review, as the whole expansion/cut content is only really around 20 minutes, but for what it’s worth, it’s decent. I can tell why it was cut because it really doesn’t add much to the game with barely any dialogue and nothing too special about the map, but I still enjoyed it. Also to note, there is an option for the developers to talk over your gameplay about Lost Coast which is pretty cool. Overall, I do recommend this if you have Half-Life 2 because it is included for free and gives some insight on what Half-Life 2 could’ve been like, 8/10."
3152,It's a really good level. Don't expect this huge expierence tho. Just expect one single level. Think of it as a deleted scene. It was supposed to be in half life 2 but they removed it and instead made it to show off what the source engine could do.
3153,"A short adventure that really lets you appreciate Half-Life 2 much more, I never paid any attention to the details of the game before playing this, but now I understand how much work and thought went into it. I enjoyed this very much, if you have it you should definitely play it, it's really short and totally worth it."
3154,"Its a game.
Its Half-life.
It's made by valve.
its free.
Explains how valve made/developed the Half-life 2 game series"
3155,"Someone will say this is shitty short game, but yes it's short but this is used to show how really looks and works HDR
This one is some small experiment to show how did they made the half life's and etc.

xdd"
3156,"Northing too special about this compared to the half life roster 
but its got decent graphics, the same enemys and pretty quick to complete, 
though oddly addictive as the map design is quite unique which is why I have played this game
so many times.

Pros:
interesting map

cons:
very easy and short life span


Overal: I would recommend the game but its a page note in the halflife franchise so I recommend you check out the rest of the franchise, consider this a taste test of how the half life games work overall.

7/10"
3157,Very detailed but short
3158,"1. 10 minute removed Half-life 2 level.
2. Big benchmark test for High Dynamic Range technology.

Is it worth it?










WISELY DONE, Mister Freeman..."
3159,"this is like a doodle in game form. theres no context, and its alright, but dont think about it too hard. might give you whiplash and leave you a bit confused though."
3160,It's like a demo that used to cost 40 dollars.
3161,"Action-packed and loud, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a mostly fun mini-campaign that altough has no relevance and the stakes are nearly not as high as the original, mirrors everything else very well, combat and graphics alike. Rating: 7/10"
3162,"Game released as a teaser back in the day , yet outbeats any COD game"
3163,9/10
3164,"Very short game, basically one level that they took out from Half-Life 2 as a tech demo (like everyone else has said). It's interesting for the game developer commentary, which Valve has generously included to give an insight into their process, and otherwise it's tight HL2 gameplay. There's only Combine (human) enemies, no zombies or headcrabs, I believe. It doesn't fit into or affect the story at all.

I recommend it for people who know and enjoy Half-Life 2, and for those who want to think about principles of game development and level design.

For everyone else? Hmmm... if you don't know the Half-Life games that well, you could get this game as a demo to see if it's your thing, but if you want a *FULL* game right off the bat, you'll want to go for Half-Life 2."
3165,Game of the year 2005.
3166,"Got lost

Edit: Full review here - http://puu.sh/tfZNs"
3167,"The game was good but it was too short for me. After getting down and returnig to the main menu i reloaded my quicksave to chech if t really ends there . It ended there :/
this is better provided for a demo of half life 2"

Half-Life 3 : You can't play"
3169,Don't go into the water mate
3170,"This is the add-on download that comes with Half-Life 2. I would not recommend playing it, as it is basically a tutorial of how the engine works. If you are interested in it, then go for it."
3171,"Lost Coast is a demo, released in between the original HL2 and Ep1 to demonstrate some engine techologies (like HDR) that were later implemented into Source Engine (yep, Half-Life 2 had no MBlur or HDR or ""Very High"" texture settings in 2004, and AA was maximum 4x (6x for ATI Cards)).
9/10 as a tech demo, but it's not technically a game."
3172,"very goodo product my gettlemen and ladies but plez noted its a fucking showcase read the game descripsion now the game very well made really shows how much u can do in the engine its in, very good."
3173,"half life 2: lost coast is a tech demo that is in the form of a short chapter/level on a coast of some sort

pros:
fun

meh:
none

cons:
non

this is a tech demo showing off hdr and the source engine. pretty fun. took me 10 minutes to beat."
3174,"It`s good , but too short :P"
3175,It's literally a tech demo without a proper ending.
3176,it's very small game
3177,Why would you need HL3 when you have this.
3178,gut gut
3179,It's gof
3180,Good but short.
3181,tech demo quite literaly
3182,"It is important for people to realize this is really just a tech demo for Valve to show off the High Dynamic Range lighting they were fooling around with at the time this was released. This came out sometime around the release of the first Episodic expansion to Half-Life 2 and doesn't fit in with the story or anything. It doesn't take more than a half hour to blaze through this little demo but it is fun and enjoyable.

Since it is free, I would say play through Half-Life 2 and then enjoy this little guy and then play the expansions."
3183,short but nice
3184,old times - good point
3185,Ok...
3186,Its short but fun to play after you finish Half Life 2
3187,meh
3188,A great reminder that games are art.
3189,It's fun but the problem is the game is short but lets just say it was Half-Life 2: Episode 3/Half-life 3
3190,It´s ok and short.
3191,When's HL3 coming?
3192," After playing around with the level for a bit, I can definitely say that Lost Coast is a complete success. It's not available seperately, but it is available in the Half Life Complete Pack (which is on sale right now). Here, you play as Gordon Freeman, as you come across the tiny town of St. Olga, whom is under attack by the Combine with a gun that launches headcrabs into the town. The 14-Minute Tech Demo shows off what the Source engine can really do, and as a result the game looks beautiful. It's almost like a work of art.
 The level is paced very well here. You start by heading upwards on a cliff, where you encounter quite a few Combine soldiers blocking your way. The level has little cover here, so you must be aware of enemy positions and use your grenades well here. You are given a few other weapons along with the Gravity Gun to boost your arsenal. Once in the courtyard, you are allowed to take a small break and take in your surroundings as the game shows off the High-Dynamic-Range Rendering (or HDR Rendering).
 You then enter a church, and one small puzzle later more Combine soldiers enter. You are not allowed to leave until you defeat them all, which is something that wasn't really explored in the original Half-Life or Half-Life 2, so it's nice to see some different gameplay elements here (along with the aforementioned cliff). After you defeat the enemies, you are led outside where you confront a chopper in a very confined area. After that, the level is over.
 Overall, the game succeeds in the one thing it was meant to do: be an excercise in level design and act like a tech demo. This level is the very reason many maps in games such as Team Fortress 2 or the Source Counter-Strike games look so good. However, it's length really shows it's a cut piece of content (cut from Highway 17) and, being a demo, you wish for more. Then you go back to playing regular Half-Life.
9/10
Pros: A sweet, short level with brilliant level design that looks good in the proccess
Cons: It's length is short compared to other levels in previous games in the Half-Life franchise"
3193,Good level.
3194,nice game
3195,"So to make it clear- this is not a game really, this is more like demo for Source engine. Really great info to be told and overall nice idea to make such demo. I would suggest it to be Free though."
3196,I found a hl3 disk underwater.
3197,Don't recommend buying it on it's own as it's basically just a little tech demo of the source engine - comes free with Half Life 2.
3198,"actually has a small explanation of the story, but was a HDR demo, cannot recommend this for any price, nolonger free"
3199,Well this game is great and all but i dont think this should cost money since this is like a tech demo
3200,gr8 b8 gaben.
3201,Wait.. Is this a game?? I thought it were like a 20 minutes long beta for Half-Life 2.
3202,10/10
3203,A short but intense episode for HL2 to test the graphics at max! :)
3204,Interesting to know how the HDR works.
3205,I enjoyed listening to your commentary Gaben! pls upgrade my level ty
3206,Its alright
3207,Nice
3208,"-launches game

3209,garbage
3210,there's a lot of depth to this one
3211,"Very interesting to watch the developers talk about how they did various things.I wish this was in Highway 17 section of HL2! I mean, just look at that view!"
3212,"This came as part of the HL2 series that I was buying to replace my old DVD versions, and I was fooled in to beleiving this was the full version. It is not. It is, in the reas world, a very brief playable demo."
3213,"I loved all half life games and I look forward to the HL3; with this short tour about the making of Half Life, we feel the necessity of another great game... those emotions that Half Life left inside of me were just... marvelous :') Thanks Valve! <3"
3214,"I got it for free with Counter-strike:source disc and i think it deserves to be free. Nothing wrong with it, it's just shorter than a 90 year old wrinkly penis"
3215,"I forgot this was in my library, but it's.... Good? It's just a removed level in Half-Life 2, and its insanely short. I don't know,  if you want to try out HL2 without paying for it, then try this out I guess..."
3216,"This is a tech demo. The negitive reviews are all saying they thought it was a game. Maybe read into a game before buying it. I overall give this a 9/10. AMybe after a long time, the skyboxes will stop clipping out in in some of the worst spots for it to happen. thats a Source bug though, not the game itself's."
3217,Nice single level to play
3218,"Fun little tech demo worth playing once or twice, gameplay is the same as Half-Life 2, graphics are great still, with the awesome late Roman (Byzantine) chruch, I would recommend this"
3219,"This is not a game, it is an engine showcase. Nothing else. Do not install it unless you want to play around with engine and admire its specifications."
3220,"If it came in anything other than a bundle, which I don't believe it does, I would not recomend playing gthis game. However since it does come in a bundle with a lot of other fantastic games, it's fine. Half Life Lost Coast is a short tech demo, the story of which is cut content from Half Life 2. It's fun enough, but doesn't warrant more than one or two runs through."
3221,Short but good
3222,"lost/10, would coast again"
3223,lol
3224,An Instant Classic!
3225,Looks good.
3226,"[u]What I liked about the game[/u] 
[list]
[*]	What can I say; it's a tech demo and a dam good one. It's a shame they didn't use the map in half-life 2. 

[*]	A beautiful looking map with derelict buildings and a bit of an industrial theme going on. When entering the church, one of the classic pieces of music from half-life 2 started playing, it gave me goose bumps. There are also new items you can use with the gravity gun.  

[*]	Get to fight some combine soldiers and a hunter chopper.

[u]Conclusion[/u] 

At the end of the day its bonus content for Half-life 2. It's a showcase of the source engine. I played the game with commentaries on and found them quite interesting. 
Definitely worth a play through, especially if you enjoyed half-life 2.

3255,"this game may be very short, but it is really fun to play over and over again"

It's super short but also fun for those 10 minutes.  What's not to love?"
3266,"Eh, it's not worth your time because it take probably 10-15 minutes to beat it.  It's so short it can't be reviewed well enough to give it a thumbs up and there is pretty much no story to it: go up to the church destroy something, go outside, destroy something, end.  If you have to pay for it don't it should be free, or at most $1.99"
3267,Its So Cool I Loved The Commentary! THX!
3268,Was nice to know about development. Now let's wait for Half Life Episode 3 :)
3269,"Disclaimer: This came together with my Half Life 2 purchase.

Fun little benchmark based on the 2005 Source Engine, back when Valve was experimenting with HDR content in their games. Also, It used to cost 35$ so it was a nice idea for it to come together with Half Life 2."
3270,I suck at it
3271,Closest thing to Half Life 3. Did not know however that Valve developed HDR way back in 2010.
3272,"It's like a demo, but better..."
3273,still trying to find a way to kill the old man
3274,"you know you have a problem when a sequel needs a demo and it looks even worse than the ground zeroes demo for the metal gear solid v the phantom pain-game

big problemos, i dislike having to downvote a black mesa sequel-demo-game, but at the same time i don't

get your shit together, crowbar collective. i expected more from you guys, even after the zen expansion-scandal. peace"
3275,"This was an excellent tech. demo to show off what the Source Engine could do in Half-Life 2 and a great way to get a feel for the controls so you don't go into H.L.2. a unpolished noob.

You get it by buying H.L.2, it's worth taking for a spin before REALLY getting into the shoes of ""THE FREE-MAN."""
3276,Not a bad addon. I had fun with it.
3277,it's okay
3278,"Its a cut level of half life 2 that comes packaged in the game. Doesn't fit into the story, but it's a nice that the developers threw in this as some extra gameplay."
3279,I dont know how i got this... i didnt buy it.... its cool.
3280,"Great little bonus experience for after you've played Half-Life 2. It's a short level that's meant to show off some of the new technologies Valve was using to make HL2, and this particular level set in a beautiful oceanside town really shows off just how great the graphics were. I think first-person shooters of 2004 (HL2, FarCry, etc.) really raised the bar in the visual department of games.

On top of just being an short and enjoyable level in a nice setting cut out from the main game, you also get 14 short commentaries from the developers that help you to understand the type of resourcefulness that goes into making games look great, especially when there are hardware limitations."
3281,"Best Benchmark test for your pc, has an unique story and few gameplay mechanics"
3282,"[h1] Tech Demo [/h1]
This is a great tech demo for HDR lighting (Yes, this is a tech demo. Get that through your head before you write a review, please.) in my opinion. If you're intrested in the source engine and got this with Half-Life 2, its a must play (must expeience?), I think.

[h1] The Gameplay [/h1] [b] Some Spoilers! [/b]
The little bit of gameplay that comes with the demo also entertained me while I marveled at the lighting. It isn't hard and not to easy, like most of the puzzles in the other Half-Life games. The whole product is a cut chapter from Half-Life 2, where you must deactivate a combine cannon that is firing upon a close village. While you travel to the cannon, you are attacked by combine soldiers. It also has a brief cliff-side part, which reminded me of the cliff-side trek from the original Half-Life. After you have de-activated the cannon with the mighty power of physics, you must fight another small group of combine and then take down a combine helecopter, and then find your way back down to the ground, then, the experince is over.

[h1] Developer Commentary [/h1]
The Dev Comm tells you about the HDR lighting and why the location of the chapter is what it is, while giving you nice visial references. The all mighty Gabe also talks. Twice.

[h1] Video Stress Test [/h1]
Takes you through the game and calculates your average FPS (Frames Per Second), which could be helpfull to you in the future, so you know if you can run a certain game at good frames before you buy it. You can also send your results to Valve. Do it, there isn't really a reason not too.

[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
This is a tech demo for HDR lighting in the source engine. It has some nice gameplay thrown in, and there isn't really a reason not to play it, since it comes free with Half-Life 2.

[h1] A Tip! [/h1]
If Gabe tells you you don't have HDR enabled, you can enable it in Options>Video>Advanced Options. Just look for HDR at the bottom and turn it on full."
3283,"Cool level design...

Oh wait... there's only one level...

but is fun
8/GabeN's butter smooth voice"
3284,nice one gee.
3285,Half-Life 2: Lost Pause
3286,"Considering it comes with HL2, i guess it's okey, doesn't make sense but more HL2 is always a good thing."
3287,This one is great!
3288,!
3289,I can finally say I completed a Half-Life game!
3290,Great game! Plays on high specs on my mac mini!
3291,Great expansion to one of the greatest games of all time. To bad it's incredibly short
3292,"A filler game, not really a game its honestly 20 minutes of content, and more of an attempt to show you the graphics improvement in th game at the time. Although worth playing if you are a half-life fan and are starving for any half life related content."
3293,great game receve for free this only cut level from half life 2 very easy
3294,It was a nice demo for what ever that was i forgot what it said but nice vavle.
3295,Better story and production value than all Call of Duty games.
3296,Best game
3297,I wish this is in original game.
3298,"It has become outdated now as it was intended to be a demo for HL2. It's a nice script on the history of the development of HL2, but treating it as any more than that is pushing it. Play it if it comes with your game, but if for some reason you are put in a situation where you have to buy it, don't."
3299,Very short
3300,"A very quick and short lost part of half-life 2 that filled with 14 commentary from the developers include gabe newell about how they design and develope game like half-life 2. 

You as Gorden that will do a little bit of combat some exploring and then one small easy puzzle to destory a big gun that's been shelling the nearby village. Shouldn't take more then 10 minutes to complete but it's quite fun to hear developer talking about everything. 

10/10... Try it out hear what Valve staff have to say. I just wish they will make more games."
3301,"Pros:
- It's a Half Life ""lost-episode"", it's still Half Life- can't go wrong!
- Adds some attributes to Gmod.
- Still looks amazing for being MORE than 10 years old now.
- You can run graphical benchmarks to see if your outdated pci x4 card still works as good as when you bought it.
- You can run graphical benchmarks to see if your updated Ti or Rx card can laugh at how fast it can cap at 300fps.
- Crowbar!

Cons:
- Game is more than 10 years old now, and is lost in the coast of HL3 dreams. (Pun)
- People like me make stupid puns about it being lost in a coast.
- Half Life 3 was delayed 15 years because Gabe Newell lost the files off the coast of the ocean.
- More terrible puns made about the name, and HL3 release dates.

Overall: Download it, play it, then cry when you finish it and realise there's nothing more after this. Likely won't be for ages to come. GREAT EPISODE THOUGH!"
3302,shows how good vaulve can get with game making. it also comes free with any HL2 purches's so yay.:-D
3303,"This is a great game for those who like the graphics side of video games. Since Illuminati renders valve incapable of making Half-Life 3, this will have to do. 10/10"
3304,Fun little side part of the game that didn't make it into Half life 2 but still super fun to play and it has awesome graphics. any time of Half life never gets old.
3305,"Just buy HL2, because HL2 is a great game and you get this for free with it if you want this

It's an okay level."
3306,графа и настольгия
3307,"For a game from 2005, it looks gorgeous. Level is kind of short, but i think this is mostly a sort of tech demo then an actual game. On my GTX 1050 and old Core 2 Quaq QX6700, it runs great.(200+ fps)"
3308,i like the half life series i love merle dandridge and i like survival games i LOVE THIS HALF LIFE ITEM
3309,"It's more Half-Life, what's not to like?"
3310,"Nice showcase ,you always make great stuff Valve 

But 

 HALF LIFE 3 PLEASE!!!!!"
3311,"yeh well it's not really a game, more of a small test area. Still, interesting enough in it's own tiny, isolated way, I am glad I didn't miss it."
3312,Doesn't run on my 486. 0/10
3313,The lost coast is a short part to half life 2.
3314,Back then this was a great demo to the upcoming Half Life 2. Amazing new features that had never been seen before.... good times.
3315,Too short
3316,you can listen to lord gaben's voice  10000000000000000/10000000000000000
3317,"First of all, I would like to mention that this thing is rather short. Even an average shooters player can run through this in about 15 minutes. For more experienced players it might take even less.

Visuals. In one word stunning. If you keep in mind it's about 10 years old. This thing still looks great, especially water surface effects and the church... the church is just lovely ! Felt almost guilty for helping damaging such a beauty.

Other then that this just another HL chapter, although with grande visuals. The point is to help a small costal town get rid of combine invasion, icludding a chopper. Not exactly easy, but still short.

However in general I would still give this 9/10."
3318,Best valve game ever!
3319,I don't know how I got this or what this even is but it's alright.
3320,"hey, that's pretty good.

10/10"
3321,"Went over it again, pretty cool little game, not gonna lie.
That's all I have to say.
Move along."
3322,Sack o shit.
3323,fun little  tech demo
3324,"a fast and easy way to learn what half life is like, Half life 2 lost coast takes you to a Off-story location so it has no spoilers to new players.   highly suggested for people who want a small puzzle or two in their shooter games, and those who like fast paced action.

i reccomend playing this for any half life fan out there or just any fan of shooter games in general."
3325,"Would definitely reccommend. If you're not aware, it's a chapter of Half-Life 2 that was released late and did not get included into the campaign. It really completes the HL2 experience. The level is very pretty, same great writing, enemies, and level design as the rest of the game."
3326,A nice tech demo showing some of Valve's design process for their games.
3327,It was a very interesting experience just play yet another HL2 Level and to know more about their design process.
3328,"If you expect this to be a sidekick to Half-Life 2 like opposing force or blue shift were to Half-Life, you'll be disappointed. It is just one Level that was not featured in Half-Life 2 and instead was used as a demonstration of the new High Dynamic Range lightning feature of the Source-engine. This is done quite well with a nice commentary that explanes the different methods that were used. 
It's a good tec-demo and should be played with commentary."
3329,This game is really good also we need Half Life 3 :)
3330,"Even though the game was short, it did have very good graphics and had an entertaining story. Wonder if we'll see the sailor in half life 3"
3331,"idk unstander stand but its ok

"
3332,"Just a short demo. Extra mission: escape the route and try to get to the factory on the other side of the bay, post a screen shot when you get there."
3333,It's pretty good for how short it is. Although I did find that there were places where you could get stuck and no longer progress forward.
3334,Finished in 12 minutes -_-
3335,"This was awesome! A really cool insight into the makings of the Half Life games, and the way they are rendered. A short fun shooter without commentary, but I highly recommend thwe commentary for the full experience. Shout out to Gabe Newell. If they made content like this for every game they develop, it would be super duper."
3336,Literally a dev commentary on a bonus level of the game. Yeah it is interesting but you don't need it at all.
3337,Meh
3338,I want Half Life 3 :)))
3339,"Great short.
Wishing for HL3. :("
3340,"Look, mum. I'm reviewing a tech-demo!"
3341,"Sadly its not a Hl3 demo ;(, but it is half life and you may be able to beat it in under 10 minutes but its not meant to be a long game like the others, its just a dynamic showcase for new lighting for the source engine. Still get it for the 7 extra minutes of half life."
3342,I left this game running on my computer when I took a nap and now I've played it more than almost 90% of my library
3343,"so yeah this is just to show off sorce engine, nothing to great but it can act like a demo for half-life 2. yet still a good game."
3344,"Wish I knew I could speedrun this ""game"" in 3.8 seconds before I played it, oh well."
3345,Its a good way to show a new mehcanic.
3346,Half life 3
3347,"Introducing features, that are quite out-dated now... Nonetheless half life is half life & this was & still is a thrill to play. :)"
3348,wtf did i just played? lol
3349,Best game ever.
3350,"false advertising, the coast is right there. it isnt lost at all."
3351,"A short, extra level for HL2, this game takes place in a beach, where we fought Combine soliders and a helicopter at the end. My favorite part of this particular deleted stage is that we can easily throw enemies down the cliff into the water, which is ultimately satisfying. This game would be better if it was longer, with perhaps the addition of aquatic enemies, such as the Ichtyosaur."
3352,hcbdkccd
3353,"It's just like Half Life 2, but shorter. Still good."
3354,Nice little demo of what the Source Engine is capable of.
3355,A nice little extra for Half-Life 2. *Note that this is not an add-on or expansion like episodes 1 & 2. It is basically a 30 minute area which was cut from the game. It comes with developer commentary and is free so there is no reason not to have a look! 7/10
3356,A tech-demo that manages to be fun and cohesive. Wow!
3357,Its always so exciting to see a new installment of mr... i mean...DR. Freemens adventures.
3358,"For what i know this game is intended to showcase the new graphic effect for the Source engine and yes this game is really short, it will take you about under 30 minutes (I acctually finish this In under 15 minutes), but still this demo Is still fun to play despite the length of the game plus I always use this demo to test some skins and mods for HL2 that available on internet.

Finally do I recommend this demo?... I guess so, If you think 30 minutes or less can satisfy you then go for it.

Plus this game Is free to download when you purchase a copy of HL2."
3359,oho
3360,Good little short chapter wish this was in the full game
3361,Very very short game/level but accompanied by the voice of the dev team explaining something about the graphics and stuff. awesome infos.
3362,This game is so bad dont buy it!
3363,It's pretty good.
3364,This is a pretty cool way for Valve to tell you how they make Half-Life 2
3365,I have absolutely no idea why I have 6 hours in this game.
3366,"Somehow, I have 33 hours in this game. It takes like 3 minutes to complete. I think I tried to get a wireless xbox controller to work on my PC, before I realised I needed a wired one, and this was the game I tested. Now my controller solution works like a dream.

Game is fine, too."
3367,one level?!?
3368,Short but good.
3369,eh
3370,"Believe it or not, Lost Coast has alot of replayability. Its a pretty good benchmark for testing the strength of your computer and being so short can be a good experience for newcomers to get the idea of Half Life 2. 

8/10"
3371,sex
3372,"worst game ever
"
3373,"4/10 
Yes I know what this game was made for but it's not Half Life 3"
3374,We do not listen to developer commentary to hear about AMBIENT OCCLUSION.
3375,"A lot of people say the original is always better then the sqeual. I have to disagree. This is a game who does it right when they say ""Alright god dammit we're gonna make a second chapter of this game and where gonna do it right!"". There is so much to say about this game, the massive cult following it's gain to it's various RP servers it's spun off in GMOD. It's massive amount of lore to it's amazing combat system. It's nothing but amazing! There is so much to learn, so much to enjoy, so much to love! I know I sound like I'm kissing ♥♥♥ when I say this but this game makes me love valve more than anything. Either being the same badass scientist that crawled his way out of that hell hole known as Black Mesa smashing Crowbars into the ugly guls of Alien Monsters now into the Gasmask of Metro Police Officers that opress a civilian populace under a Universal Union Banner in the name of ""Civil Status"". Or riding around in a scrapped sports car with a rather attractive but at the same time a TRUE strong and independant female character Alyx. You feel like a badass actually doing something for a resistance, no, a revolution for mankind being enslaved by a Alien Empire. This game is perfect. This game is art."
3376,pretty cool and definetly for hardcore hakf life fans.
3377,"Amazing graphics and guns for a 2005 'game'. 

Cool.

Optimization is amazing. 

60fps"
3378,"Ten dollars. Only a few hours of gameplay. 16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games.

But... wow Half-Life 2: Lost Coast blew me away. It doesn't need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment. It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience.

I think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it. I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses. So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the game's name. And I'm glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it. So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Half-Life 2: Lost Coast on tumblr (god help us) and the entire story's already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game won't be as incredible of an experience. I'm sorry.

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast's ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive. Upon your game's startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the game's story pathing. If you're the type who immerses yourself into the game's charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you. It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced. You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that you're shaking in your seat in true fear and can't stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss. The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesn't stop being good from there onwards.

On the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it. If you scoff at the game's sparing choice since you're too cool or grown up to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend. And unlike many other games, this isn't just a simple ""Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, let's reset the game and nothing changes"" moment... the weight of a dark choice is huge. It forever changes your playthrough. Reset the game, and the characters know. Events change. And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents. In the end, ignoring what Half-Life 2: Lost Coast sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story. Very little character development, and the world isn't explained to you, nothing. There's very little reward for going through this route. Yet it is a choice you can do. Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game... It's trying to stop you from getting to the end of this route. Before its too late.

It's as if you're doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world. And that's what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that you're willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you. It's a test of your willpower, and it's your choice. The worst thing? The damage cannot be repaired. Go clean, or go home tainted. The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyone's happiness after the most satisfying happy ending. The happiness you worked so hard to earn. And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again. That's absolutely brutal, and yet that's still a choice. Amazing.

Yes, this game might not be for everyone. The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it. But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyone's been talking about this game, give it a shot. This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten.

It is a sin to call Half-Life 2: Lost Coast a game. Doing that would categorize Half-Life 2: Lost Coast into the bland and consequence-free ""kill-em-all"" genres that a lot of games are falling into now.

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast a story-driven, emotional experience."
3379,"Buggy, short mod, and, really boring."
3380,"It's a neat tech-demo with a cool HL2 level to boot. I recommend playing with HDR and commentary enabled. It has the usual Half-Life 2 gameplay though it is quite short. The environment looks great.

Listening to Valve devs talk about engine and game development is surprisingly interesting.

If I were to give a negative, the difficulty is kinda all over the place. The first ṕart (in the cliffside) has quite a bit of difficulty, but every thing after that is kinda easy. The game defaults to Easy difficulty but the difficulty fluctuation makes it quite hard to recommend something in particular.

As far as wasting your time goes, you could be doing worse."
3381,"IGN ""3/10"" Better than Half-Life 3"
3382,My Garry's Mod before I could even afford Garry's Mod. I'd spawn and make npcs fight on an isolated island in this map.
3383,"Though it's pretty small, I enjoyed every second of it.  The fighting parts were pretty amazing, so too was the design of the place"
3384,"[h1] Half-Life 2: Lost Coast [/h1]

As the Steam Store page mentions, LC is a tech demo that was originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter in HL2. It is a free download and is automatically added to your Steam Library when you purchase a copy of HL2.

The demo is very short and you can probably rush through it in under 30 minutes. You have access to all of the weapons from the original game to fight your way up a cliff side and retake an ancient church which the Combine have garrisoned into an artillery platform.

The main purpose of the demo was to showcase Valve’s new HDR (High Dynamic Range) lighting and demonstrate how it integrates with the Source engine. Despite being released in 2005, the results still look relatively impressive today. Highlights include how light reflects on water and wet terrain, and how it refracts through glass. There is also an interesting section where HDR tries to imitate the iris of a human eye by using light blooms when the player is suddenly exposed to daylight after being in shadow.

Additionally, LC introduces a commentary mode to the HL series. In this mode, audio nodes can be found which play a track recorded by various members of the development staff. These nodes provide some insightful commentary if you are at all interested in the development process, or if you simply want to get a little more replay value.

There are some rough edges in the demo; I encountered some graphical flickering and occasions where the enemy AI would not respond as cleanly as in the original game. Despite this, LC is a beautifully presented and swift diversion that can easily be included in your play through of the HL2 series."
3385,"i have actually completed this game its just 1 mission though, pretty decent"

3387,Really interesting experience! Nice graphics!
3388,"This, uh, ""game"" does an excellent job of demonstrating the absolute best of the graphical capabilities of the Source engine. It does a far less excellent job of being a ""game"" though. You'll only need to play it once to get the point of it. I'd recommend turning on commentary and enjoying the pretty scenery.

[spoiler] It's the closest we'll ever get to Half Life 3. [/spoiler]"
3389,"I guess this is a fun sample of HL2, but it is very short.  It'll probably only take you 30 minutes or less to complete this game."
3390,"Aw, Hell yeah."
3391,"More of a graphics test than an actual game, still, it is really fun to play and the atmosphere and setting are gorgeous.

Highly recommended for the Orange Box fans here. It's very short, but the action is just as good as an Half Life level and, of course, the visuals are quite beautiful.

3397,"Maybe if we loop through playing this enough times, we'll get Half-Life 3!"
3398,Fun little side mission that comes with Half Life 2
3399,"This is a good game, I guess. It has some Half Life 2 aspects but this game is mainly to teach you about the Source engine and how Valve makes games in the Source Engine like Half Life 2. I got this for free when I received when I bought Half Life 2 along with Episodes One and Two. For a game that used to be $40.00 it wasn't worth it for only 22 minutes, at the most, of gameplay. I guess it was a good game for teaching about the Source Engine."
3400,wtf why do i have 10 hours on this
3401,its ok its not the best i prefer half life 2

even.. though... there's.. umm.... no backstory... to it... whatsoever... 

XD JK why does this exist"
3411,"Thank you

Edit: Hello again, This is also a pretty good game.
other than that it was probably supposed to be included in Half-Life 2.

What a fun, short experience.
Or was it?!!?!??!
Did you ever notice the Illuminati watching you the whole time?
No?
That is because you weren't looking for it.
See, to find it follow these instructions perfectly.
1)As soon as you have control of the Freeman, Turn around and take 47 steps forward.
2)Walk left until you run into something.
3)Next, find the box that when broke open, drops only ammo.
4)If you get ammo, then turn around and listen to the nodes in this order,
...3,7,1,2,6,4,6,5,6...
5)After that is complete, simply carry on with the level.
6)That is, until the helicopter fight.
7)During the fight, after hitting 2 of the 3 shots you need to hit, jump off the cliff and hit the final rocket. Aim for the water.
8)If you die even though you hit the water, you succeeded.
9)Now beat the boss, go to the area under the fight and use the elevator to get down.
10)Now, before the man finishes talking, kill yourself above him, any way works.
11)By doing this, you skrew up the dialogue, as you are not supposed to be able to die.
12){FINAL STEP} This will accidentally trigger 4 seconds of dialogue that features 2 men talking about their masters and more

3434,"I mean... eh? it's kinda fun, and since it's just basically a free, optional level for (and only for) people who own HL2 there's no point to reviewing it. give it a play. it plays like a super light, quick level of HL2, complete with a little ""ending"" as you leave the coast. it's a free tech demo, man. just play it."
3435,15-30 more minutes of glorious Half-Life 2! For FREE! What's not to like?
3436,Cool and Good.
3437,money well spent !
3438,dont buy this 30 minutes of gameplay and how they made this game JUST MAKE HALF LIFE 3
3439,A nice little game to show the HDR tech. Fun to play. It has also a benchmark option for your graphics.
3440,"Half:Life 2 Lost Coast is:
- A short lil 10 minute experience gameplay wise.
- ~10 minutes of interesting backstorys via developer commentary.
- A good way to see what settings your pc can handle regarding source games.
- A fisherman with a stereothypical british accent
- all together will keep busy for around 30 minutes (MAX)

It comes with half-life 2. a little backstory cant hurt, nothing special but still interesting to learn about the mechanics a bit."
3441,"Just a tease, but worth checking out anyway."
3442,Came with my CS:S when I've bought it (long ago). I haven't played much but it seems to be a good game
3443,It's a fancy tech demo in the half-life universe
3444,nice but short
3445,An interesting little tech demo with some commentary from VALVE that is free with HALF-LIFE 2. Why not?
3446,the story of lost coast was confusing like everyother haif life i played on my xbox 360...will they make haif life 1 and 2 for xbox one any day now?anyways the game was really good!8999/over 9000!!!!get it?
3447,nice little showcase and comentary
3448,"Don't expect any more than 20 minutes of gameplay
The commentary however is interesting and does briefly cover some aspects of level design as well as a comparison between the non-hdr graphics and the hdr graphics

Recommended if you're interesetd in tech demos or Valve's internal process, otherwise the demo doesn't add any real lore"
3449,the first time playing is 8/11/2016
3450,"It's kinda cool, but it is only one leve and realy doesn't need to exist."
3451,"What a beautiful tech demo, plus the water looks much better than the ones in Half Life 2"
3452,A good little mini play but should have more content and maybe some achievements otherwise pretty good.
3453,"Super short, like 10 minutes. Not that interesting or great. But I guess its worth it if you're a big half-life fan."
3454,only took me 15 mins. 1010 IGN
3455,"Short documentary as Video Games which is great. Remind me when Valve used to make Video Games (now they make money).

P.S. I left this review while waiting for Half-Life 3"
3456,nice!
3457, I lost my game when I had a hard drive failure. I have tried several times to get it back and with no luck. I received it free and would like to have it again. thank you
3458,"yeah it was good but short

gabe said some stuff though"
3459,It is cool to see it as a somewhat deleted scene.
3460,"I really like this game because at the first game, you already have some weapons to shoot some enemies... It's offer you interesting stories too and you will enjoy this game... I recommend you to buy this game too because Half Life 2 : Lost Coast will give you great adventure... That's my review for this game and i hope you enjoy and like this game... :)"
3461,OMFG LOVE HALF LIFE 2!
3462,case it just 6 min long
3463,wheres to coast why did uoy lose it
3464,I don't even know how this got in my library. 5 second playtime
3465,Nice Gaem i Really Leik it
3466,"A short additional level for Half-Life 2.  More of a proof of concept than a significant issue to the canon, but if you're a Freeman Fan, you'll grab anything like this, and it does look good, even if it doesn't last long."
3467,its a five minute cut episode from halflife 2 pretty goood
3468,Just as amazing as anyother Half-Life game. 5/5.
3469,"Half-Life 2 Lost Coast is a non-canon tech demo and testbed for the Source Engine, given to players freely upon purchasing Half-Life 2, in which subsequently takes place between the levels Highway 17, and Sandtraps in a town named St. Olga. Lost Coast essentially is a paradox, and it is apperant as a testbed/tech demo with its subtle opening and ending, being told to destroy a combine outpost high in the cliffs inside a monastery, by a mysterious character with the nickname ""The Fisherman"" and then returning to the man only to quickly black out. However, it is very welcome as being not only a pregenetor of sorts towards building the finished product of HL2, but being a part of the HL2 series itself."
3470,‌
3471,The Closest we get to Half-Life 3.
3472,I wish they'd atleast finish this game branch
3473,"And we all waiting ""Liamda 3""!"
3474,Basically the best Half-Life 3 emulator out there! Make sure to pick this up when it's heavily discounted around the holidays.
3475,Melhor Jogo!
3476,Not half life 3
3477,This is a really enjoyable 30 - 1 hour of gameplay. It is really fun and good.
3478,Just a neat little technological demonstration of a scene that was cut from the original [i]Half-Life 2[/i].
3479,"While it's a pretty short game (lasting usually between 10 and 30 minutes) it's pretty good. Of course, I'm not saying you should buy it alone, but definitely buy the Orange Box pack and play this after beating Half-Life 2 and both episodes (you'll need something to cheer you up) I highly recommend keeping the harpoon by the way. You'll see what I mean."
3480,"PROs:
Half Life feel
Nice time killer
Gaben
Russian Guy
Leeches
Interesting commentary. (Didn't listen to all of it. Will come back eventually to all of it.)

CONs:
No Half-Life 3
No feast

10/10
Mr. Friedman.... Fishman?"
3481,Fun!
3482,I think Valve had nothing better to do as they created this piece of level?
3483,Just learning this. But I do say I like it but I need to play it when I am more awake
3484,half life but not
3485,Who would pay for this?..............
3486,this one is short.
3487,i might have the most amount of playtime ever
3488,A cool tech demo.
3489,10/10
3490,"Cool tech demo. Decent level
6/10"
3491,"The game worked once and only once. When I tried to open it again, it didn't work."
3492,"Nothing really special, just a tech demo. Great for testing mods, nice commentary, but it's only a demo at the end of it all."
3493,"It is a pretty cool level, I just wished it was a little bit longer than like 20 minutes."
3494, To consider this a game is to consider wilford brimley not having diabeetus
3495,kinda dope
3496,Only one level with developer commentary. Not worth the download.
3497,"really cool, i see some people complaining its to short but you get what you pay for"
3498,"Don't buy this if you don't own Half Life 2, it's definately not worth the money. But if you do, feel free to download it. It's a nice little tech demo that shows of the graphical capabilities of Half Life 2."
3499,"[b]Lost Coast[/b] is a short 2005 tech demo showcasing HDR lighting, with commentary from a handful of then Valve employees like Viktor Antonov, Randy Lundeen, and Robin Walker. Playing through with commentary enabled is recommended. Doing so will allow you to gain some insight on how Valve works on levels and the way they implement technologies like HDR. Comes free with [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/iN008/recommended/220/]Half-Life 2[/url]."
3500,"Originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2, Lost Coast is a playable technology showcase that introduces High Dynamic Range lighting to the Source engine. 

So don't expect much from a tech-demo :)

Metacritic:
tbd / 100 Metascore
7.7 / 10 User Score"
3501,.
3502,This is not exactly a game but Source engine demonstration tour. If you would like to learn more about it then go ahead and install it.
3503,Amusing side story and the tech explanations were interesting.
3504,this is episode 4
3505,I didn't like the fact that there was only one level and not much game play
3506,"Extremely short, but a solid extra level form a great game."
3507,I liked it a lot and I definetly want more of these
3508,"I really enjoyed this. Was a nice refresher after Half Life 2.

Short/10.
"
3509,"Cool, was very interesting to hear a little about development process!"
3510,Learn the BTS of Valves Half Life 2. This actually helps me encourage being a more open minded thinker. Made me to want to be a game dev in the future.
3511,"Great, I love the commentary. I give it a THUMBS UP 
"
3512,"I loved the concept of telling the players what the team thought while creating the game.
Good work :D"
3513,"Has a nice hardware benchmark map that puts your system to the test and gives you the average framerate at the end. I would love to give this to kids that think they know how to write FPS boosting guides for TF2.

Edit: it seems that Source SDK Base 2013 singleplayer (which you can download for free through the Steam client under library>tools) actually has this tech demo's benchmarking capabilites. So if you want to compare your PC to that of your friends', or want to debunk bad advice from an FPS boosting guide, you can just install that."
3514,"Fun short extra part in the Half-Life universe. Perfect for speedrun newbies!?
Playtime: Approximately 10 minutes."
3515,A great game for anybody interested in game design. Short but sweet.
3516,if you liked half life 2 and its episodes you will like this
3517,This is HL-3 You may now cry.
3518,"GabeN's voice
1000000/10"
3519,"Well it took me 11 minutes to beat, so I guess its pretty good."
3520,Better than Half-Life 2
3521,More likely a test field of engine.
3522,"I loved that demonstration about every good features of the Source engine used for Half-Life 2, I really enjoyed seeing an unused fisherman NPC, some lightning and graphical demonstration and I really liked what I saw, good job Valve."
3523,Great way to relax a little from playing HALF LIFE 2!
3524,Short but Gold.
3525,A great short spin off from Half Life...  We need more of these games long and short..
3526,The only half life 3 we will ever get
3527,"hi well Valve did REALLY WELL on this game and  i think Valve should let you get the game then just recieving it randomly when you get Half-Life 2 or something,

anyways when i got Half-Life 2 i got Half-Life 2 lost coast i guess it's just a tiny pack for Half-life 2.

also i got this for free is that supposed to happen?

and one last thing  100000000/100000000% AMAZINGNESS!!!"
3528,"thanx, guys . no more. james"
3529,good game but short.
3530,I actually have no idea why I played this more than Episode 1 and 2.
3531,Short but interesting and insightful.
3532,Short and sweet
3533,"I give this  ★★★★★★★

HALF-LIFE 2: Lost Coast in my Opinion was a nice little game even if i had no idea how i got there. There are some people that like games for there texters but i do it for the story.

The fisherman 
even i had no idea who he was a bit off in the face but that is just my opinion maby if he had a role in a story i can get a better perspective of him.

background
for the town it was a bit lifeless mabe if you added distant screams 
i do not know what you where going for so i do not know what to say too add to it 
and the background was pleasing.

what CAN be added 
Audio
-breeze
-waves
-seagulls"
3534,A really cool tech demo to show the amount of work thats put into half life 2
3535,Amazing game that has like 500 hours of content.
3536,just a little add-on about HDR
3537,"Best game I have ever played!!!!!!!

[h1]10/10[/h1]"
3538,"Created a s a demo for the engine's technology - short but pleasing.
MADE ON PC."
3539,"For some reason I have spent 5 hours in this, no idea why."
3540,this is better than hl2 itself
3541,"Very short but who the fuck cares,its pretty and its awesome."
3542,it was pretty cool or something
3543,This was like some random test that valve did for the graphics of Source engine. Fun 30 minutes if you ask me xD
3544,Honsetly it's so fun and beautiful that I am kind of sad that it wasn't in the game.
3545,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast

Although this isnt really a game, this really shows us what the Source engine can do. I think the Source engine is an on point engine to make games with. Anyways, lets get to what this game/level is about. I can see that this level/game is not linked to the Half-Life which is fine by me. What I find alot about this, is that there is a great amount of puzzles to solve to finish the level, which I find quiet difficult, but at the same time, quiet good. I really like the end of the level, shooting down an enemy helicopter, now thats a good ening to a level! ;)

Valve, please keep making more games. Also what I recommend doing is that if you ever are gonna make Half-Life 3, you should release a tech demo, so you can show us what its like, but try not spoil the story, if there is one, of course.

9/10"
3546,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a very short tech demo where the developers of the source engine talk about their work. Originally, it was part of the Half-Life 2 campaign but it was cut in the end.

[b]pros[/b]
+ Lord Gaben greets you
+ There is some shooting
+ Interesting cliff map
+ Makes you think about what if this map wasn't cut

[b]cons[/b]
- Cringy old man...I'm glad he was cut.
- It's very short and can be played through in about 10-30min. Depends if you are interested into the audio messages of the developpers.
- Tech demo only

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
I'd recommend playing Lost Coast if you are interested into the source engine or if you want to see about this mysterious Lost Coast map that was cut from Half-Life 2. If your interests don't meet these conditions, don't touch Lost Coast.

Replay value: None
Rating: None
Recommendation: It depends"
3547,Short and sweet
3548,18 minutes... 18 minutes of playtime and I am shit at hl2...
3549,"Does what it says, only useful for learning."
3550,"Didnt knew it was a tech showcase, still enjoyed."
3551,"Even though it's a free bonus with Half-Life 2, it still isn't really worth playing. It's really short, and extremely easy compared to the main game. Plus, the tech this demo was showing off was back-ported to Half-Life 2 in later updates, so it doesn't even look impressive compared to the original nowadays, either. I'd recommend just moving on to the Episodes or some mods. It's just boring compared to everything else."
3552,still better at meny new games
3553,"I recommend this game because is awesome demo
+ graphics really cool
+ gameplay interesting
+ add commentary how they devlop this game
+ physics
"
3554,"Got this demo along with a box set that included HL:S, HL2 and CS:S back in ~2006. Finally got around to playing it with commentary today. 

It's a good little tech demo, the island looks pretty fantastic for being almost 12 years old. I also enjoy that if you install it it automatically downloads HL2 for you (in case you feel the urge to play that after exploring the island)."
3555,He's lost and im a coast guard
3556,Good
3557,Good
3558,Half-life 2: lost coast is a good game. Id play it more if there where more chapters.
3559,"""introduction with GabeN's voice""
10/10
It's not a game but rather a technological demonstration of new technologies incorporated in source engine back in 2005. The world is gorgeous even by today's standeard. Buy this only if the whole Valve pack is available on sale. I got mine on summer sale!!"
3560,"The horror of Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 begins and ends with a hallway. Down its dark length lurks walking robot animals out to kill me, and I’m only armed with a goofy bear mask and a flashlight. If I light up the hallway, I’m treated to snapshots of terror: toothy jaws hanging open at weird angles, outstretched arms of patchy fur and gut-like cables, and eyes with a pinhole-sized glow staring right back at me. The hallway is a funnel of fear.

I peered down that hallway a lot during my roughly six hours playing Freddy’s 2, sole developer Scott Cawthon’s followup to his first spooky suit stalker simulator released in early August. Cawthon didn't wait long to leverage word-of-mouth popularity and YouTube celebrities’ horrified faces with a sequel that further establishes his skills at crafting a truly frightening experience.

What I wanted from a Five Nights sequel was more mind games and more uncertainty. I wanted the plodding animatronic suits to find me and rip my face off in new and interesting ways. I wanted working legs. What I got was a horror game dipping heavily into deception and subtlety, a wonderfully cruel cocktail of supernatural mystery and jolts of panicked adrenaline. Enjoying the good parts, though, comes with a cost of a frustratingly steep difficulty.

Once again, I’ve made the questionable career move of taking the overnight security shift at a children’s pizzeria for a measly pay rate. Strange Things occur among the tiled corridors and empty dining rooms at night, and staying alive entails warding off walking murderous animatronic animals by tracking their movements through grainy camera feeds.

I’m still rooted in place with no degree of movement beyond swiveling my head left or right; a slight disappointment to my hopes of freely wandering around. The first game used that restriction as an added layer of stress, and that’s effective enough the second time around, but the novelty feels a little worn now. Freddy’s world is interesting enough that I want to explore it. I wouldn’t mind poking around a corrupted version of Chuck E. Cheese’s."
3561,Really good little game just to get you excited for the rest of the story
3562,Better than Half-Life 2 and its Episodes combined.
3563,It's just a paid Half-Life 2 demo
3564,"HL2 Lost Coast still looks fantastic for a 10 year old tech demo. Contains interesting commentary by the Valve developers including Gabe Newell. A very short interactive graphics tour, tales 10-15 minutes."
3565,All i have to say is that it's a shame it's not a full game. So beautiful!
3566,"Short but beautiful. The HDR graphics as well as the setting of the game makes this a very important part in Valve's history and in gaming as well. The music that plays in the church not only makes the scene look very alive, but makes you think back on Half Life's history, remembering the impact and memories you've had since it all started."
3567,"eu sinceramente não sei por que eu tenho 5 horas de lost coast mas basicamente é um jogo que testa recursos da source e é um jogo curto, mas apesar disso é legalzinho (menos chato que o episode two)"
3568,Half-Life: Lost Money
3569,"This is a tech demo from back when they were trying to get HDR working. It's about 20 minutes long in actual gameplay, plus audio commentaries from the team. Interesting from a historical gaming point of view."
3570,"Pros:
+the water

Cons:
-they claimed they would keep making these and they LIED"
3571,GABE NEWELL
3572,"lets be honest, the only reason why youre here is because of the orange box or that youre to poor to actually but hf2. Didnt know it was a demo tho so yeah why not right. Gives you a good percpective on what to expect from the full game.

10/10 would play demo again"
3573,Top 10 games of 2004

3579,I still can't believe that this is free now I looked at it before I got half life 2 and it was like $30 but I got it for free when I got HL2
3580,this mini game is pretty cool and withh all graphice the highest it looks amazing i reconmend
3581,Its Fun
3582,its ok
3583,"This one is pretty cool. It looks nice too. Too short though. Reminds me of the cliff segment from Half-Life 1. Could've been longer though. Has a wee bit of replayability, as there's a commentary mode where you listen to the Valve devs talk about HDR and level design. Overall, it's okay."
3584,Am Waiting Half-Life 3 Coming xD
3585,"I want so much more out of half-life series like half-life 2 episode 3 i just want an end to this plot that has haunted me for years

3586,"Extremely short, but it's a demo. Good thing it's free :P"
3587,pretty good ig
3588,"Interesting tech demo/lost level of HL2. I bought it because it was included in a collection, but it was still a nice short play."
3589,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast - Half Life 2 mechanics ''intro''. No story line, just showing how the main game mechanic works."
3590,"The graphics are so amazing. Wish It was actually part of Half Life 2, not just a seperate downloadable level."
3591,"Fun, humourous, and short show-off game."
3592,"A good tech demo, but I'd expect something like this at an E3 showing, not for sale. A good game, but not worth the price of admission!"
3593,Ya coast eez my coast!
3594,"This was such a short, intense ""mini-game"". I don't classified as a game because it really losing the game it's just an add-on to another one but still it isn't all right one but I don't really recommend it it's just 10 minutes of game playing then you're done"
3595,I got this when I purchased the Orange Box and it is a great thing to use of you want to learn the basics of the source engine.
3596,"A fun, free cut-content map from Half-Life 2. Great voice acting work, fun gameplay. There's not a lot I can say about it. It's short and .. free."
3597,fun to cheat in
3598,"Really fast fun game, I wish there was more to it :()"
3599,"I like the game, but to short . Is their  a free  version thats a longer game."
3600,im not sure how this got in my library but its fairly good
3601,Nice little tech demo.
3602,yeah its good
3603,Its free i like it!
3604,guess this is free now? gg
3605,Best demo ever
3606,I thourght there was more to it but i guess there wasnt a cool game style though felt like i was playing doom in a way.
3607,It shows you a cut chapter of half life 2 saying what is the power behided the source engine can do very interesting
3608,Lol.
3609,Its pretty fun even though its like a beta thing. You should try it if you are bored
3610,"This half life 2 story alternative is too short,  you just stop a head crap launcher and that's it, not my favorite"
3611,"Lost Coast, this is one you can skip but I recommend this to anyone who has beat Half Life 2. It has no story basically. It's just an extra level for Half Life 2 and it has a commentary with Gabe Newell welcoming you to the level! 8/10"
3612,Good demo. It's a bit more laggy than HL2 but is a good chapter.
3613,","
3614,"Got this for free.

Gaben i will do magical things with your naughty spot."
3615,"This game isn't really needed, but like Blue Shift, it's a good experience. So, if you have money to spare along with some space, you could give this game a try."
3616,Really not worth the cost of electricity to download. A tiny 'level' and 5gb of wasted bandwidth.
3617,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a weird little game, well I say game but it's more of a standalone level. I got it as a part of the Orange Box and played it when I got bored. As you can see from my play time I completed it (without commentary) in about 11 minutes. This is a neat little distraction if you own it but would have no substance if released on it's own"
3618,"i cant find the coast, i lost the coast.

0/10 volvo plz fix."
3619,13/37
3620,Worth playing with the commentary on
3621,39 minutes of a great game. Better played with comments from the designers!
3622,"i lost 17 minutes of my life

still good though"
3623,Good Game
3624,Not too shabby but i wish there was more to it
3625,I didn't know this was a tech demo but I still found it fun to play. Plus the technical stuff was quite interesting.
3626,It's good
3627,>:(
3628,"Lost Coast is a Half Life demo which lasts about 20 minutes. It's short, it's fun, and it's free if you buy Half Life 2, I think."
3629,It's a 15 minute Half-Life 2 experience.
3630,Cool little tech demo
3631,Not Half Bad
3632,Fordon Gishman
3633,"Definitily looks great, still in 2016, and it doesnt require an expensive PC"
3634,"I played this game right after:
Half Life
Half Life: Opposing force
Half Life: Blue shift
Half Life 2
Half Life 2: Deathmatch

This one is really the shortest of the serie, I think it's like an additional level of Half Life 2. I don't think it deserve it's price but I bought the valve package during the summer sales so it came with it. I recommend it just because it follows the Half Life 2 story."
3635,"Needs more attention. Even as a fragment of HL2, it was great."
3636,"Not a whole lot to it, but it was fun all the same. Play it with the commentary to get a bit more insight about it."
3637,"Too short, but great! Specially at the end (That chopper fight!)"
3638,"To short, though is a good sign that Valve  is still developing games. It was easy, though it was very pleasing."
3639,nice
3640,Something to play when you're waiting for your pizza rolls
3641,Finished it it 13 minutes. Now it just takes up library space :(
3642,"Short, but unique."
3643,"Good to hear Gabes beautiful voice.

3.5/5"
3644,Beautiful graphics.  I recommend playing the original Half-Life 2 first though.
3645,i found the coast guys its alright
3646,worth 40 bucks
3647,Niceee
3648,Good game
3649,This game have a short story. The gameplay is superb. I like Half Life 2 games! 10/10
3650,Well...it's short and it has Half-Life slapped on it..so it has that going for it.
3651,"1. Greet old drunk
2. Go to church to wreak the big gun shooting at city
3. Kill helicopter

17 minutes."
3652,"A nice little game to ""test"" your pc for the source engine and is a nice little hour long game"
3653,Short but good. I also opened the console and turned off clipping so I could explore the town and the background scenery. It was interesting to see how they made those parts of the game.
3654,"short and sweet, spawn some weapons for added fun"
3655,"Pros 
Its Half life related

Cons
Its incredibly short

View=Mixed"
3656,"I won't lie, this is definately me when im driving."
3657,"(if you ask how i got this i got it when i bought hl2 itself)
the game is short but still fun also you can experiment on gmod with it to!


(that means you can have HECU vs combine)"
3658,dddddddddddddd
3659,"Be careful, its amazing! thats all im gonna say"
3660,"Interesting cut level from [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/220]Half-Life 2[/url] that was repurposed as a free tech demo for new Source engine stuff. It's supposed to take place between Highway 17 and Sandtraps. If you really liked HL2, there's no harm in checking this out. Be warned, this level will often stump unwary players."
3661,meh
3662,very nice
3663,Awesome game but it takes way too long to finish this
3664,"Short but interesting piece, if you just want a tiny bit of extra half-life content, get this."
3665,"Guys, It's not a actual Game, it's just a showcase for their new Source files."
3666,10/10 for crash your pc!
3667,"It's a tech demo and a planned level meant to show off the capabilities of the Source engine.
...Why did i rehash the description?
Because it is what it is. It's not too long and has hardly any content, but that's the point.
And i think it makes its point just fine."
3668,get out of the negative section
3669,"Came free with Half Life 2, pretty fun and it shows the source engine maxed to its full limit."
3670,short but really fun little demo showcasing of what the source engine can do. recemmend for people who are buying HL2 or The orange box
3671,lost interest pretty fast just like VALVE LOST INTEREST IN MAKING ACTUAL GAMES ESPECIALLY HALF LIFE 3 or EPISODE 3 WHAT EVER...................
3672,"7.8 out of 10
Too long"
3673,Definitely recommended to all HL2 fans. You get to know more about development and HDR technology.
3674,it is not as fun as hl2
3675,cool
3676,This game cured my aids disease
3677,A playable graphical demo with actually a lot of fun. This should be the only way to do benchmarking.
3678,BEUTIFAL GRAFFICS
3679,Gaben my savior. . . tell me more about half life 3
3680,a short casual level of half life 2 that makes fun and also helps you collect games for your next game collector badge
3681,Solid tech demo for source engine.
3682,memes
3683,"If you have this game, dont expect a full game! Its just some test engine for half life 2 so you can try out the games graphics and such. The only pro about this 10 minute thingy is that you get to hear Gabe Newell's voice."
3684,this is laike
3685,Only 10 or 20 minutes of gameplay but still very entertaining.
3686,"[b]Pros (+)[/b]
+ Great Fun
+ Very Short (Takes 5 mins to complete as its deleted gameplay)
+ Can Mess around for [b]Hours[/b] at end

[b]Cons (-)[/b]
- Very Short, if you want a long game
- Sometimes glitches

[h1]TLDR - Great fun because it's so short[/h1]"
3687,Pretty
3688,"why the hell do i have 4 hours in this game if the story is completed in 5 minutes




help"
3689,"""you must be here to take down the combine."" The fisherman

     This was an add-on to half-life 2 and came with it along with half-life deathmatch and counter-strike: source. It isn't very long and to me is just a training ground. but it's fun nonetheless. I reccomend it to anyone who likes half-life and wants to get the same action but doesn't have enough time to do so.
     Your job is to take down the combine occupation at St. Olga by destroying their headcrab pod launcher. In the process you kill all the combine operating there. after finishing you fade out and probably get taken by the gman for other purposes.
     This is a game demo and was intended to be in the final game but was cut. it was supposed to be somewhere between the highway chapters and the sandtrap chapters. In truth it can be played anywhere any time. The game also includes commentary from the developers and is interesting to listen to after beating the game.

""Well, i suppose you have other things to do, uh, nice knowing you!"" The fisherman"
3690,Fun to play and btw i got this free with hl2 i was happy to see that but than i came to know its demo of source engine 9/11
3691,"It is a piece of shit it has nothing to do with the story, this game was made to explain graphics shit and It's very short"
3692,"I'm not even sure if you can really buy this or not but, while it provides you with a shortlived (but enjoyable) experience, it's a *very* short mission you're given to play. If the case is that you are able to buy this, don't. It was intended on being a showcase for Source engine's capabilities, not its playability."
3693,One of the wierdest and most fun fps games ever! Some people call it hat simulator and I can see why there are tons of hats from strange hats to unusual hats this game is all about hats!
3694,"Short demo of the Source Engine graphic capabilities. It is not really a game in itself, just a showcase. It also has 14 making off tracks that you can learn a little bit about the process of game development."
3695,Only if it's free.
3696,"When I bought Episodes 1 & 2 together, I noticed I got this as a bonus. I thought ""Oh sweet! Another Half life game!"" Well, I was half right. Lost Coast is a removed section of the original Half Life 2 game in which you liberate a small sea-side town from the Combine forces. What intrests me the most is that the Fisherman NPC, a NPC exclusive to this REMOVED section, is one of, if not Valve's highest quality NPC's when it comes to detail and animations. This intruiges me since he was removed, and never seen again in the HL series, or in any other Valve game (to my knowlegde).

Overall, I'd suggest getting it in a bundle, not as a single purchase. But awesome play though!"
3697,"I'll give this 5/7 this was a perfect games.

I just shotted Combine soldier with a shotgun fron 500meters away.
GG"
3698,"Impressive technology, this fisherman looked better then NPC's from Skyrim"
3699,"Waste of a game took me 10 minutes, how to play for longer, try and beat your time, Yay?
Probably had to pay for it ages ago tbh"
3700,Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is benchmark for 2005 PC's
3701,To this day I still don\'t understand the point of this wierd dlc. Unless it was a user created mod that valve used thier magic dev powers to make better.
3702,Well worth my 100 dollars
3703,"This was made at a time when the concept of HDR in video games was new, therefore Valve edumacates you on that plus a few (at the time) new things about the Source Engine"
3704,Im not big hl fan and this was first half life I played because I got it when I bought css. I think this is a deleted mission from hl2. well u get it free when u buy source engine game so who could say that its bad that they gave u free game with the one u bought.
3705,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was supposed to be a level added into the original game, but for some reason never made it. Instead they pushed the Source engine to its graphical limits instead and using this level as a platform show casing the power of the Source engine. The level takes about 15 minutes to complete, but you will be treated with eye candy and if you're looking for more Half-Life 2 to play, then this level will be enjoyable."
3706,First- DON'T TRY TO FINISH THIS. It's not a long continuation or anything. It's just a fun little semi-puzzle sequence that introduces some new design elements to Half-Life.
3707,is good
3708,Great demo of HDR.
3709,You get to hear the voice of Gaben - G-A-B-E-N. Cannot wait for Lost Coast: Episode 1 to hear him again.
3710,Great demo from back in the time..lol
3711,"Not bad as a free thing with Half-Life 2, can't really conplain."
3712,Meh
3713,"This was the shortest Half Life 2 game ever, but it was also good"
3714,"Thank you valve, very cool tech demo"
3715,good 30 minutes of gameplay lol
3716,"Lost coast, more like lost content."
3717,i once got lost
3718,"You visit a beautiful church.
9/10"
3719,"seems like more of a proof of consept than an actual game. well it is 
if there is a price now I would not pay for this product.

sorry but no"
3720,My dick is longer than this.
3721,The NEw Adventure of Gordon Freeman......
3722,"it's quite a nice demo, I suggest getting it in one of the Valve Half-Life bundles though"
3723,"Exciting, Kind of a game that will keep you blood flowing!"
3724,Good Game!!
3725,"Lost Coast is a spin-off to Half-Life 2 where Gordon finds himself at a sea port town where a fisherman informs Gordon that the Combine have a gun cannon base in the town and needs to be shut down. So Gordon takes on the job by killing the Combine soldiers stationed in the town in order to get to the cannon that needs to be dealt with. While it has the same graphics and game play as Half-Life 2, this game is completely non-canon to the franchise as it doesn't fit anywhere in the Half-Life franchise. I like to think of it as a dream Gordon had at some point, cause originally I thought it takes place before Half-Life 2, except Gordon has his Gravity Gun which he obtain during Half-Life 2 so it's a dream sequence in my opinion. The game is short in length but worth playing if you want to play something related Half-Life but just don't expect to witness anything that provides more to the franchise cause it doesn't."
3726,+1
3727,I got this game for free alongside Half-Life 2 for some reason :/
3728,I do recommend you play this cut Half-Life 2 chapter.
3729,"This is just a showcase of HDR, lighting and such. If you are interested in choices game developers have to make and how a video game is made this is the game for you. It's very short and not worth playing/buying without interest in the commentary.

But it was great for its time"
3730,Amazing. Very good and very good graphfics for its time. Loved the campaign altho it was sort!
3731,this was a next gen back then
3732,God yes...best game ever
3733,It was rly interesting. I have never seen something like this. I recomend to play this game. Of course try to play HL2 and episodes.
3734,This was actually the first game that i launched when i got in to Steam in the first place xD
3735,wait what? what the fuck just happened? is that it?
3736,a bit pointless
3737,First off  it is a small game but it has amazing HDR work and it is interesting how it all works. Worth it.
3738,Bad BAd BAD HARD HARD HARD
3739,"just as good as the other Half life games....but i was able to beat this mini game in less than 45 min.
"
3740,Better than Hunt Down The Freeman
3741,insane Fun
3742,So many bugs dont buy it...
3743,"It's a cute little time waster. If you're really craving Half Life content and haven't yet tried this, go for it. It shouldn't take you longer than 20 minutes."
3744,It would be so good... in 1999.
3745,"if you think about it, this is half life 3"
3746,Awesome game! Wish there was more to this version. Hoping to see some updates to it ^w^
3747,"is gay
9/11
kys"
3748,What
3749,"meh not gonna complain had fun with it aswell, i understand its just a little extra not a whole new big game:) 
some people in the negative section don't even read the description"
3750,"For thosee who doesn't know : this is a test from Valve on a software that makes Half Life look better, so you need to activate the commentaries from the developpers to understand the purpose of that ""game"""
3751,Only took 20 minutes to complete. Too good...
3752,COOL GAME
3753,"The first thing you'll have to say about Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, is not about the game itself, but rather about your computer. You will be dumbfounded to find your PC has been able to completely install the game in less than 2 minutes. 

The answer to your question will be shortly inturrupted when you find out the game was a tech demo and it lasts anywhere from 20-40 minutes, depending on how bad you are at aiming.

Since its release almost a decade ago, rave reviews have been pouring in. The general consesus has been
""I paid for what?""

Thanks to its groundbreaking technlogy showing off just what a 20-year-old engine is capable of, users have been delighted and surprised as they formed together outside of valve's offices. To demand their money back. However, Gabe Newell saw good in these peasants and created Steam Sales for everyone. 

Upon hearing about this miracle of modern gaming, a statue of Gabe was erected out of macaroni and cheese to be a shining temple to the god-like superiority of valve software. Unforuntely, those waiting outside valve's offices for HL3 grew hungry and tired and eventually devoured the macaroni statue. Darkness fell over the land, with nothing but TF2 updates slowly creeping over the desolate horizon.

------

Overall I would say this game was far too short and had a severe lack of memes. 

6/10

"
3754,"I suppose its cool if you want to see how its all made, but if you just want a real, interesting game this isn't it."
3755,"This is a tiny add-on to Half-Life 2.
Simple, short, and quick.
Play it for a quick burst of Half-Life, an average game should take 30 or so minutes."
3756,"Good but it could be Half life 3 instead.Hurry it up Gaben,you got the whole internet waiting."
3757,"I don't want to say to much about this, but what I will say is that it's awesome. Valve's idea of adding commentaries onto their games about how they made them is great. I'm a big fan about learning how stuff works and this game is a great source for that. 

8/10. It's perfect for teaching players about stuff that goes on behind the scenes of their favorite games."
3758,well.......................................I was looking for some spot that Ive missed to continue the game for 6 and a half hours and then I realised thats the full game........................................................
3759,Its a Tech Demo
3760,Amazing!
3761,A great little adventure in the Half Life engine. Short but sweet.
3762,Unfortunately ... very dissapointing...
3763,A half game that lives up to it's name! And I don't even know what the price is nowadays.
3764,"Lost Coast was...
...
I...I'm not really sure


Not recommending on the sole basis it's a waste of your time. I...think it is. I'm still not sure.
Maybe I do recommend it?"
3765,Its a technology demo from the 2000s. Nothing more lol.
3766,Too long and complex. Couldn't figure anything out.
3767,"There isn't much I can say about Half-Life 2: lost Coast that hasn't been said already. It's a short mission cut from the campaign of HL2 that also serves to showcase the high dynamic range Lighting added to the Source engine a bit after the release of the game. This is pretty much a fancy way of saying ""improved lighting anf draw distance"", and it certainly shows. 

Going in, I knew Lost Coast was gonna be pretty short, but I had no idea it was gonna be only 20 minutes long -- in fact, I spent around half as much time fiddling with the options as I did playing through the game for the first time. If you want an idea of how short Lost Coast is, I'll list literally everything that happens:

1. Gordon wakes up on a beach with a crud ton of weapons
2. Some old fisherman tells Gordon to destroy a Headcrab Shell launcher
3. Gordon ascends a mountain and shoots some Combine soliders
4. Gordon comes across a monestary and (most likely) tries in vain to open all the locked doors
5. Gordon enters the church where the launcher is and jams it with a random object
6. Gordon is assaulted by more soldiers and takes them out
7. Gordon takes on a helicopter with a rocket launcher
8. Gordon takes an elivator back down to the beach
9. THE END

While this demo may be only half as long as I expected, the few enemy encounters are all enjoyable, and the brevity serves the game's replay value. If you're like me, you'll want to play it again several times so you can explore every nook and cranny of the coast. In fact, it's even possible to reach the city of St. Olga! Read the guide below to get a step by step tutorial of how to reach the island:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=195911970

One of the things you'll notice when you begin the mission is the beautiful sight of an oceanside town in the distance, which would have been concealed by a cloud of ""fog"" in the original HL2. HDRL would've have made the coast of Highway 17 look so much better that I almost wish HL2 would've been further delayed so the feature could be implemented. Combine that with incredibly detailed environment, and even over a deccade later, Lost Coast looks stunning.

Aside from its brevity, my only issues with HL2: Lost Coast are its lack of enemy variety (you only come across soldiers, poison Headcrabs, and a chopper) and the scarcity of Kelly Bailey's pulse-pounding techno soundtrack.

If you've already purchased Half-Life 2, you'll be able to install Lost Coast for free, and the fun you'll have more than justifies adding this title to your library."
3768,Great replay value!
3769,"very good game love it
"
3770,"It's fun

Rather Half-Life over this."
3771,If you like hl but dont have the money for it this is a short but fun game so download it have fun!
3772,"A very short game - I think I did it in several minutes(the remaining recorded time was probably me idling or and running the stress test it had).... Apparently was a tech demo to show case HDR or whatever graphics, but decied to later add it in to be part of the HL2 storyline.... Thumbs up because it's part of the HL2 storyline.

Short 1/2 hour bit of Half-Life 2. 

Worth picking up as part of a pack (I got it as part of the orange box, way back when)."

"
3782,"i like it 
"
3783,"This game had been sitting in my library for years, and I finally gave it a try today. Well, this isn't really a game. It's a tech demo. You see, you play through a small section that was cut from Half Life 2, and you can enable the commentary of people who work at Valve. It's pretty much a short museum tour with a guide. I mean, I really love museums myself, and I really enjoy learning stuff about game development, so I liked this. Sadly, it's quite short, it will probably take less than 20 minutes to complete. 

But damn, even for a 2005 game, the graphics are still quite decent, and they don't look horribly dated like some stuff from that era. Plus, Gaben talks to you."
3784,"Can  I really give this game a bad review?


It's free.

you can't judge a game thats free."
3785,"The missing tidbit that Half-Life 2 needs.
You don't wanna miss out on this.

8/10 too short"
3786,Good Game :3
3787,Doesn't have anything to do with the Half Life story line.
3788,Playing this just made me sad.
3789,"Fun little distraction, very pretty."
3790,Enjoyed :)
3791,O MY GOD I WISH IT FUCKING DIED I KNOW WHY    I HATE BARNALCELES
3792,"That's a good game, didn't pay for it :P very very short demo though."
3793,I recommend you to buy this game if you like beautiful grapichs
3794,"i am playing this now, because my pc was really out of date when this game first released. At last i'm able to play it with my gear with 2 core CPU and 2GB of RAM. I am happy :)"

3798,9.5/10 It's ok
3799,"Well, Its Good I Would Say"
3800,How did he get that harpoon back? I literally shot it at a combine far from him... oh well. It's a good map.
3801,This one scenario add on can be gotten for free and is not worthing paying even one penny for.  It is one single short lived 10 minute maximum scenario that i completed in five minutes on hard difficulty.  I really expected more.  So definitely do not recommend unless you got it for free.
3802,<3 10/10
3803,"This demo makes me wonder how much better Half Life 2 would have been had everything in the beta made it into the released game.  The trip up the coast is easily the best part of the game with all it's atmosphere of beautiful vistas, abandoned buildings and sniping opportunities with the newly acquired crossbow.  This is a great demo to come back to just to run the stress test video for some eye candy and to check out your latest video card/drivers.  Fisherman's face is great to zoom in on to see the highest detailed character in the game."
3804,6/10 only 900 seconds of game play.

3806,This is a joke
3807,domnt work
3808,"I really like the idea of this kind of stuff, i think Valve should do more tech demos. I loved the shiny hanging pots in the church, also the light that shined in from the windows in the church, i loved how there were legit lightstripes. Beautiful demo. 10/10"
3809,10 mins of gameplay. wtf?
3810,A good way to test the Source Engine to your computer.
3811,fishman with freeman
3812,How to waste $40.00 USD: The Game
3813,worst fucking game ever. half life 3 ripoff
3814,"One of my first steam games, this tech demo has some pretty funny glitches and showcases HL2's 2004 Source engine. Prettty short game tho!"
3815,Fun little demo for Half-Life 2. Very well made for its time.
3816,recommended if you want to meet a badass old fisherman.
3817,I don't recommend this because its a fun little thing if you got it in a pack BUT its not worth it at all on its own I thought thier would be more but no. They should lower the price to 1 or 2 dollars although i dont even think its worth that.
3818,"Its beutiful, even tho i got lost i just looked at the game world and was dumbfounded 10/10"
3819,nice game :)
3820,Best 10 minute valve game out there. 10/10 would listen to Gabens voice again.
3821,Very cool demo! Really loved it!
3822,"Basically Half-Life: Uplink of Half-Life 2. A short tech demo, not related to the main story. Though you get it for free when buying Half-Life 2 so what's to lose?"
3823,"This is terrible... a demo of stuff that graphics can do in 2004...

Shame on Valve for releasing this"
3824,"Very long game, took me years to beat. I am coming to you from the year 2072, Donald Trump bot has just speedran the game, being the first entity to ever finish the game, it only took him 67 years."
3825,Good demo.
3826,Nice little map.
3827,"one of the best games ever made, overall took 7.5 hours to complete, tons of content 10/10 would play 100 times over"
3828,A bit short but good game! ^3^
3829,✔
3830,"Complete waste of money ""13/10 -IGN"""
3831,Better than HL3
3832,"Basically a tech demo for the Source Engine, though fun to play while waiting for HL2 to download"
3833,rubbish only plays for 15 mins
3834,HL2 Lost Coast is somewhat of a Documentary Demo. One of those DVD extras you would enjoy.
3835,great demo
3836,"This is a short map, but it is a fantastic showcase of the new source engine (at least, back when it was new.)  I think I got the game in the Orange Box set I got way-back-when, and still play it once in a while just because it's quick and dirty."
3837,"A fun little demo but way too short. I beat it under an hour, like i said fun but short."
3838,Is so so short!
3839,k
3840,It's just a mini-game of Hλlf-Life 2 but was nice!
3841,"Played it once then deleted it, just a demo really but it is still pretty cool."
3842,"This was another Valve's hidden masterpiece of the Half-Life 2, I love all the graphics, enviroment, and the most special, the water and the lighting.

And about the HDR (High Dynamic Range) they devolped that day, it was such a beautiful thing that I'd discovered in this game.

The gameplay is very short! Because it only required 10 minutes to beat it. But wherever that is, Let's just say that this one looks like a circus attraction but also presenting the most innovative feature in the game, what a good combination.

I reccomended that to have this, just buy the original Half-Life 2, this game is also included as the free expansion on it."
3843,its a fun perty level
3844,"It's like an extra chapter of HL2. If you can get it super cheap or with the HL Complete bundle, great. Otherwise it's just more of the same."
3845,It was a nice addition to the Half-Life 2 campaign
3846,A technical demo intended to showcase new features for the Source engine.
3847,Is like a demo...bad...just 20 min of gameplay ..
3848,a 20 min demo... what a waste...
3849,"It's a neat tech demo. But please don't pay for this. You're MUCH better buying Half-Life Complete. It's a good time waster when the internet is down, but that's all it pretty much is. A neat little time waster."
3850,its good
3851,NO!
3852,"It's a tech demo, what more can I say?"
3853,7/10....the story is too short.....aaa...that's all
3854,"Good demo, Its also a good benchmark 11/10 would recemond ( This game just comes with the valve complete bundl)"
3855,"I don't really know the story behind this, but from what I've seen it's a small level Valve made to test lighting in Source. But gives a soild 30 min. of play time for when you're bored."
3856,"It's pretty.

Thats' about it."
3857,Lost Coast makes me wanna play Half-Life for ever... Best Game Ever.
3858,Got that neat demo for 23 € with the complete pack. Was worth it
3859,Pay $40 for a demo? GG Gaben. I got this for free when I purchased Half Life 2. Meh.
3860,"its a good addition to players who already played half life, or if they want a quick game of half life"
3861,"""Tech Demo"" she says..

Tech Demo for one of the best games ever, she says.

Tech demo.

"
3862,Really? No. Just.. no...
3863,"Kinda pointless, but its free for orange box owners so its not so bad."
3864,why isn't this a game
3865,"Short and sweet showcase of new graphics technology developed by Valve, most notably use of HDR (high dynamic range) lighting."
3866,"Half Life2:Lost Coast=Half Life 3 

+Good Graphics"
3867,"""Originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2""

Well i guess that's why it's ""Lost Coast"""
3868,10/10 Got when free 10/10 Noice half life 10/10
3869,$39.99 down the drain!
3870,7/10
3871,A fun little dingle game nice commentary and looks even better than the actual game...(unfortunetly)
3872,"Find it quite funny how you could buy a demo for £28 or the complete Half-Life Series for the same price. Oh well, it's a good demo and it's worth a look. I got it with the Half-Life Complete pack during a summer sale about 8 years ago, so I wouldn't pay full price for this.

Overall, I think it's a good demo, but not for it's price."
3873,"Great game, got it for free by purchasing HL2 Ep 1 and 2. Good story premis, interesting location, and a neat puzzle all bundled into one package."
3874,"[h1]Half-Life 2:  Lost Coast Review[/h1]
[b]by KTMboyz[/b]

A nice little tech demo to show off HDR.  It's a nice way to spend 20 minutes however there is literally no replayabilty after that.  

[h1]7.9/10[/h1]"
3875,this game is a quick little bit of fun and i reccomend to try it.
3876,"Meh, it's ok if you like to learn more about the production of Half-life 2 this would be an ok game.
Don't expect it to be amazing, it's alright really."
3877,Quality gameplay.
3878,"[h1]Good, old memories...[/h1]
So one day, after school, I met with a friend at my home. We were both very young back then. I just got my first PC, but only played a few browser games on it. My friend however knew this one program [spoiler]which I thought would be illegal at first[/spoiler] called ""Steam"". The dark design of it and the fear of the unknown made me feel like a hacker. The reason why he forced me to download it and create a new account was a special sale, where AMD graphic-card-users would get some games for free. These games were Half-Life 2: Deathmatch and Half-Life 2: Lost Coast. Lost Coast was my first First-Person-Shooter. After we killed every enemy and annihilated the chopper, tried every path, spammed ""E"" at every door in hope that we could open it, we gave up. We played a whole 2 hours [spoiler](!)[/spoiler] without knowing that it is just a showcase of the beautiful Half-Life-engine. But it was great. And it felt great. The scenery was beautiful and we both knew that we would get killed if our parents would find out. Actually, I believe that the fact that we played it secretely made it even more exciting. To hide Steam and both of these brutal amok-games from my father, who checked my Computer from time to time to install security-updates, I created several sub-folders in folders, all with unique categories about ""Pokemon"" [spoiler]yes, I played Pokemon a lot back then :D[/spoiler]. I will never forget the day I started PC-gaming, nor my first FPS-experience. This day will be in my memory for all time. And no, I did not run amok a single time. [spoiler]At least not in real-life :P[/spoiler]

Edit: I played the game on another account though."
3879,Nice:D
3880,basily this is a test for your computer and not much of a game still good
3881,That's the closest to Half Life 3 we will ever get
3882,"In case you couldn't tell by playing their game, the devs walk you through a level and explain in great detail why it's a great game. Cute."
3883,"On one hand its nice to dip back into Half-Life 2, on the other hand this is little more than a tech demo and its definitley beginning to show its age. Still, an intersting diversion on the way to completing my Steam Library. I've written a more detailed write up about it here - http://jamesvssteam.blogspot.co.uk/"
3884,This game is better than the actuall Half-life 2 game!!! (sarcasm)
3885,Took me 5 minutes to complete.
3886,but like where did it go
3887,"Somewhere between 1/40th of an extra HL2 Episode, a Tech Demo, and something else entirely that stands out on it's own, this charming FPS gameplay segment is a classic that remains oddly memorable. Definitely worth playing if you own HL2."
3888,A nice chat with gaben is always something fun :D
3889,"i love this game
"
3890,"For 2005 game , This effect really awesome ... That's why i need Half-Life 3 for sure :)"
3891,How long is this game i only played for like 10 mins and it just goes to  the main menu
3892,"Great introduction to the Source engine, narrated in part by the great Gaben himself, peace be upon him."
3893,It is nice to know what went into making just a small sceen in half life 2.
3894,Gatta fight the combine. (Part Tech Demo)
3895,Worth every peeny! i feel the commenyary is very good my man!
3896,"A cut from the the game with a puzzle cut out of it as well and is also a graphical showcase.

hl3/10
^Gabe pls"
3897,"Short but good. I guess it's better for use as a demo for the full game, but even on its own it is fun, with everything that people like about halflife 2 in just 30 minutes- action, shooting, platforming, puzzle solving and even a bit of story."
3898,i am the only person to complete this game it was ok i guess
3899,"It's short, but it's fun... and free ;)

BTW, it was intended to be an extra episode between highway 17 and sandtraps, and if you play hl2 for the first time it fits well in that part of the game. though it is quite easy for being in the 8-ish chapter"
3900,"Im so fucking confused...
It's a tech demo...that you pay for?"
3901,WELL IT REALY WAS A DEMO NOTING CONNECTED TO THE STORY NOTHING CONNECTED TO THE GAME
3902,graphics are excellent-play this one
3903,"It stupid
"
3904,Great show of skill and personality
3905,"Half Life 2: Lost Coast, is an excellent tech demo to show the Source engine as well as how Half Life 2 works with it. This is how tech demos are supposed to be made with having developers and people who worked on the game talk to you, show what the engine can do, what the engine is best for, etc. I espically loved having the developer comments as it helped me engaged with Half Life 2 and this tech demo. Well done, valve!"
3906,Just talking about how they made Half-Life and other stuff.
3907,"This is just a short level cut from Half-Life 2, to introduce high-dynamic-range (HDR) to the Source Engine (later used in Episode 1 & 2). It was also an experiment in using the developer commentary in-game (also used in Episode 1 & 2). I think it does it's job. Since Lost Coast is included in all Half-Life 2 copies, there's no reason not to play this after finishing it."
3908,40$ for a tech demo gg gud gaem dont buy hl2 buy this
3909,"This game deserves Game of the Year... for eternity
Why I'm glad you asked:
-GabeN talks to you"
3910,It's better than safe sex
3911,i don't know why. but this crashes my pc all the time :/
3912,"a section of the Highway 17  with commentary from Valve?
PERFECT!"
3913,Pretty misleading... didn't like the fact that I had to pay $10 to play a 10 minute game.
3914,10/10
3915,best game ive ever played
3916,"rise and shine doctor fisherman.............

xD
"
3917,Still good for about 5 minutes of npc slaughter.
3918,bretty gud
3919,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast
fast game with modern day graphics with easy controls that moves from location A to B to C and so on, 
good amount of action and special effects

good game.

Personal Suggested Purchase Price: NA (Free With Half-Life 2)"
3920,Cool getway from regular hl2.
3921,:) Yes
3922,actually lives up to the reputation of the original.....couldh'v extended the chapter though.....
3923,"I'm sure this game was free at some point many years ago, it sits in my library even though I haven't bought it."
3924,It's okay.
3925,was beautiful but short
3926,Lol
3927,"Fun, fun, fun."
3928,"basically a tech demo
still good tho"
3929,I got lost.
3930,"Very short. A combination of scrapped Half-Life 2 content and tech demos. If you are interested in the development cycle of Half-Life or just love listening to Gabens voice while pinning combines to the wall, go for it."
3931,"People actually play this for more than 5 minutes.

"
3932,"This game is a waste of time.......
"
3933,To short but challenging
3934,"Very short mission cut out of Half-life 2. Nevertheless it is as good as Half-life 2 itself and I don't understand why they cutted it out of the original game. It is also pretty interesting to listen to the comments of the developers. You should give it a shot, you may learn a thing or two."
3935,"Very good game 11/9

Pros:

+HL2
+HL2
+HL2
+HL2

Cons:

-28 euro for demo"
3936,Is Very Gud Game!
3937,"This was a lot of fun, I wish there was more of it."
3938,"Very fun, but very short. It isn't exactly up to the standards of the games, but it is still quite enjoyable."
3939,Nice inside look into HL2 :)
3940,Damn Gub But it shud hav been longer
3941,"It's completely awesome, so long as you love Half-Life 2 of course. If you don't, there must be something wrong with you. Scurvy, perhaps. Regardless, this is a glorious complement to the big game itself and helps expand the intensity of the whole Half-Life 2 experience. Great value in a short but memorable package."
3942,"this game is short. if you know what your doing you can beat it in 4 minutes. really.
not somthing i would buy for full price but if you get it in a bundle ehhh its ok. i could write a full walkthrough in about 1 paragraph. but im not so you can get ""the full experience."""
3943,"Not really a game, more of a guided tour. A youtube video could contain the same information. Would not buy again, really wish I could get my money back TBH"
3944,"This is a useful testing tool to see if Source games will run properly and quickly on your rig, whether you run Windows, Linux, or SteamOS. I use it to check I've got the right AMD drivers working on Linux. If the frame rate is pleasant then you've likely done the right thing."
3945,"Half life 2 loast coast is short but still a great game.
Valve added new developer commentary to this game and it's great. i enjoyed the developer's commentary.
my only problem with this game is the run time. the half of hour gameplay not really worth the money. but still....
great content.

9/10 For me"
3946,"Short as heck.  Doesn't add much.

Still half life.

"
3947,"I've never played a game so short. Regardless, since it came free, I'll let it pass. There really wasn't much else to this game aside from running around from place to place. There's very little story involved."
3948,"It's just a showcase of the graphics but it's a cool little level to play. Seriously takes like 15 minutes. Don't ever, ever buy it. I got it free and that's the only way you should get it. It's not really a game, just one small level to showcase the graphics that were the best of the time."
3949,Its ok if you like walking around. Insteed play just Half-life
3950,"Due to it's short storyline and it has the console..... sv_cheats 1 makes me invincible and infinite rocket launching, and I try and get the quickest time possible."
3951,"Made me realise that the next Source engine is going to bloody beautiful
1/2 out of 3 lives"
3952,"hands down the best installment in the half-life series. the plot is amazing and the characters are rich and dynamic. if you can only play one half-life game, make it half-life 2: lost coast"
3953,its not even a fucking game m8
3954,Half-Life 2: Lost Coast
3955,Leeches taste okay I guess.
3956,"Test your graphic card on this episode. If your pc run this episode smoothly it can handle the most of the Source Steam games.
Really nice graphics and smooth map making on this short epic episode.
Try it and have fun for an hour or two.....

Oliver"
3957,This game shows off a map that was left out in the HL2 BETA but the concept here is implamented quite well. NO THIS IS NOT A MOD. This is a tech demo showing what Half-life 2 Episode 1 can do. Also Half-life 2 Lost Coast only has one map it is still quite good. My final rating is an 8/10. I think if you could go into the village and check it out and stuff it would be a lot better.
3958,"Short, but good."
3959,Its a really cool demo but more like Half life before Remake
3960,It's guuuuud
3961,very very short story but its still an ok game.
3962,Wait...$40 for this?
3963,"A cool tech demo showcasing what the Source engine can do but not much content.  But hey, it's included with the Half-Life packages so it's absolutely worth the $0 cost."
3964,"great game. gmod stole ur stuff tho
"
3965,"You really can't believe this game is a tech demo for the first Source engine, made in 2005. It's beautiful, and showcases most of this engine's capabilities, which are phenomenal. 

Now, Valve, please, Half-Life 3 confirmed?"
3966,">be 21$ 
>14 mins. gameplay 

gg"
3967,It's okay
3968,"Such nice, much Gaben voice, so 10/10"
3969,"10/10 would jump off a cliff again
and again
and again"
3970,"It's too short, but nice"
3971,13/10 would wipe Gaben's ass with $40 dollars again.
3972,Free Game? Yes pls!
3973,Nice little demo with commentaries from main guys behind HL2! :)
3974,gotsta go fast
3975,"Well, this very small DLC is just a showcase to the latest graphical achievements Valve has reached since HL2 (The main game, before Ep.1 & Ep.2)
It has no affect on the overall story, nor is it necessary to play."
3976,"Palyed it way before Steam had seen the light, glad to play it again."
3977,"I loved playing this, even though I played it for like, 15 minutes and that was the end of it. I enjoyed it anyway, because I love wreckin' some Combine scrubs."
3978,"Hey, while your still waiting for HL2:3/HL3 to come out, why not look at how they made the rest of the games!"
3979,Gaben talks about Half Life 2.
3980,Its gud
3981,"Got it in the valve pack few summers ago  (best fucking deal ever-30 games for 3 euro)

I got 15 mins of game time

met a lad with a harpoon

now its worth 30 euro


10/10 would buy for full price"
3982,OK game. Very good developer commentary.
3983,lol I thought was a whole game.
3984,"Lost Coast is a quick, fun side mission. Gordon Freeman wakes up on a shore to find that the place has been overrun by the Combine. Outfitted with little ammo and resources you scale a cliffside to the top.
The game itself was short but it proved to be fun. Limited resources meant a much more challening run. A must play for those who cannot wait for HL3."
3985,"This may be a tech-demo kind of game, but I've already countered a bug

http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198060801598/screenshot/403433347043164288

valve pls fix"
3986,This is a good mod but is way to expensive
3987,How do i get on to part 2..i alrdy killed chopper in the fortress...and it just jumps straight to startmenu for half life 2..is this only a beta or something?do i need full game?
3988,"why would anyone in their right mind spent 30 fucking euros for just a fracture of the game? it's nice that we get a kind of tour on how the game is made, but if I didn't know any better, I'd say this is a fucking scam. classy as ever Gabe."
3989,"Good ""DEMO"" for any valve game enthusiast. Otherwise don't waiste your money."
3990,"Basically a tech demo, Half Life 2: Lost Coast is a very good looking Source Engine game and the commentary is interesting. However, it is short, but the level and it's design is very fun to play on and took me about 30 min to complete (But I mainly looked at the scenery because it is a tech demo)."
3991,Quite interesting the new graphics. But now they are the old graphics :)
3992,"Here are the pros and cons for this game


Pros:

> The game looks beutiful

> Has the fisherman, who is, undoubtedly, the best character

> Gives you most of the weapons at the start of the game

> Gabe Newell gives you his Email Adress

Cons:

> It takes 12 minutes to complete

> Has one puzzle

> $40 for 12 minutes of gameplay


So heres my summary, the game is... not worth the price AT ALL. If your going to get it, I would get it in the Half-Life complete pack. But at least GabeN gives you his email
"
3993,2 short 4 Sanic.
3994,Nice
3995,"I'd say 5/5, cuz Gaben gave me his email."
3996,!
3997,Longest Game 2005. 11/10
3998,"Cool demo that comes with HL2! Worth looking into if your curious about some of the features in the Source Engine.

Added bonus: features our lord and savior!"
3999,Very fun. Classic HL2. But way to short... only 15 min!
4000,Great add-on
4001,"First things first
There's OBVIOUSLY not enough commentary"
4002,"If you got this with the Half-Life collection (which, I think is the only way to get it), I recommend you play this game first. There's no spoilers, it's very short (about an hour to complete, maybe less), and it introduces you to weapons, too.
The graphics are great, for 2005.

P.S, at the Church, you need to put one of the doors into the missle launcher."
4003,"I nice interlude between Half-Life 2 and Episode 1. While orignally made as a developers demo, it still builds upon the Freeman mythos. It shows the worshipful way the people view Freeman as a saviour, and gives you some beautiful images at the same time."
4004,Awesome
4005,"If you like church.......damn it.

2/10 religious combine lashings for gaben"
4006,"★★★☆☆

There isn't much about this game, its just a source demo game to show off the capabilities of the engine. Its a neat little experience for die-hard Half-Life fans"
4007,"This one is difficult. It is a technology demo for High Dynamic Range Rendering in the Source engine, set in the level supposed to take place after Highway 17 in Half Life 2. Even though the Source engine is falling behind compared to other engines nowadays, this game still looks great, and the added graphical effects make all areas express more detail. Aside from the technical stuff, everything else is the same as Half Life 2 in terms of how it works. I wont spoil anything.
Now, because it is only a technology demo, it is only about half an hour long, and there isn't much to do afterwards. Oh well. Not sure why it has such a high price individually, though is harmless on collections like the Orange Box. If you want to get it, get the Orange Box, as it comes with the other Half Life 2 games. Overall, it is effectively a small part of Half Life 2 with better visuals. I'm not going to give a rating, ill let my words speak for themselves."
4008,Very short...
4009,"It took me 21 mins to beat this game and it's 40 bucks
"
4010,28 euros.. played one time.. 18 minutes.
4011,Want HL3? lmao. Lost Coast
4012,"This was amazing! There better be a Half Life 3. Because the graphics were amazing! I loved the puzzle with the Missle launcher and how I had to jam it! And the sky was awesome, same with the sunlight graphics. Please update Gmod to these graphics at least!"
4013,"this is a short 30 minute demo but its still great 10/4 gaben gives u his email
"
4014,Lost Coast
4015,"Half life series, i love it <3
10/10"
4016,Nice little demo showing what source engine can do and by that I mean light reflects off skin much better and HDR and better water. I dont remember how i got this but i think its when i got HL2. Its not really suppost to do anything about the story or nothing just a demo. Its nice and short.
4017,"[h1] HALF-LIFE 2: LOST COAST [/h1]

Short but Sweet Techdemo.
Combat Encounters are pretty decent too , and it sports a new character.
If i'd be you , i'd get [url=https://www.moddb.com/mods/hl2-ep2-enhased-mod] MMod [/url] , it will make Combat hella better , and will make this worth your while."
4018,"Well... it is a tech demo... and only half an hour long. There is no way to buy just this, just consider it a perk if you purchase something like Half Life Complete or the Valve Complete Pack."
4019,"Great demo but why is it sold seperate for 39.99





Gaben/10"
4020,"Really cool concept!
The lighing and skybox is beautiful!
And when i first found it. I thought i was playing Half-Life 3, not some cut content!
 Valve should really think about remaking all cut levels from half-Life 2!"
4021,"An extremely short and almost pointless purchase. Adds nothing of longetivity or substance to the Half-Life 2 franchise.

Consists of ten minutes of combat and nothing else.

Avoid as a solo purchase, consider it carefully in a bundle."
4022,"short and sweet

(like this review is short and sweet)"
4023,"A beautiful game, clever design, gorgeus architecture. 10/10.
Although it was really short I liked playing it because it an above average sorce game."
4024,This games only purpose is to showcase graphics. That is all.
4025,Good for what it is
4026,"Short, but fun.  Kinda like this review..."
4027,"Edited Review:

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a Engine Modifications presentation, not canon to Half-Life 2, that's for sure, with commentary about what's new into the engine, nothing new gameplay wise though."
4028,its soo pretty
4029,well its to easy to esay
4030,Buy this only when it's on a sale; It's not worth the 27 euros.
4031,"lmao pay 28euros for a demo.
You can't hate Gaben for that"
4032,"Extremely short, with me beating it in 18 minutes, but it gives good insight into the world of game development. I'd recommend getting it on sale, or in the Half-Life bundle so you don't pay $10.00 on this alone."
4033,good game
4034,You gotta do some stuff because Gaben told you to.
4035,Yeet
4036,"Good game, very short tho. Took me around 30 minutes"
4037,It's a really nice Tech-Demo to play and Test out
4038,Where can I find more of this?! :D
4039,"nice, short and fun. Everything about this game is good also the use of source engine mechanics that make it great. The only downside is that this is $40!? are you kidding XD.but overall GG"
4040,"Now that you can't buy this game anymore, I don't know why I recommend you to buy it..."
4041,yep one of the longest game I ever played finished it after hours and hours of movies and the game in 10-15 minutes...
4042,"got stuck in the church and then died because of poison headcrabs


11/9.1 would replay again"
4043,Nice little thing :D It's short and it's only an old tech demo but you get it free so... it's nice :) Play it to kill the nostalgia.
4044,I love it !!  It was short but i would play it again 10/10
4045,Why is this 40$???
4046,"""Longest"" Game ever 10/10 + didnt know what to do in the church 100/10"
4047,"Most of you who have played Half-Life 2, Episode one and Episode Two just like me have been asking yourselves ""WHERE IS HALF-LIFE 3"" while pulling out your hair. But you can't hurry perfection and to me with this addition Half-Life is becoming an epic game series this is not the longest expansion but it hold true to the Half-Life 2 way of thinking. Keep the story line gripping and make them shout for more and that’s what has happened with this, as well again not the longest but still great and for the price it's a bargain. I rate this 7/10."
4048,"Pretty darn expensive for how short it is

Get original Half-Life 2 to get this game free!"
4049,"I think we get this for free for owning HL2.

It's a nice engine demo and te commentary gives you good insights on game development.

Don't pay for this."
4050,Not as good as Flora's Fruit Farm. But close.
4051,"Best 15 minutes of gameplay.

11/10."
4052,"I would call this.. Open up dev console, type some cheats and have a little fun."
4053,GOOOD GAME !!!
4054,"I know it is 30 minutes or less long and has no plot on the actual half life story line so in one point you dont lose anything buy not playing this game. Now there are some issues with the game itself, sometimes you get huge frame rate falls but if you hit the good settigs you would actually enjoy it ; Know its more like a fast expensive 30 minute programming or game development course that is very helpful in the terms of sequence and user psychology+ gabehn gives you his email to contact him :D    

PS: It actually does give the feel that will be given to the half life 3 (OMG) yes its true (SPOILER ALERT)= in the cliff area one of the developers add ""The rough terrain of a cliff could give some excitement but we didnt use that in the half life 2 series"" This means it will be put up to HL3 in a long long time ahead I think."
4055,game's old but good
4056,Noice.
4057,good
4058,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, was an exciting, exemplary showcase of the lighting technology they developed .It was a very fun action packed playable demo. I liked every bit of its challenges, and it was also very informative in away that helps you further enjoy and appreciate the time and effort spent making the entertainment every loves about the Half-Life gaming series: Good job guys!"
4059,"This review will be incredibly short as this is only one mission and it's incredibly short, so let's get straight into it.

Half Life 2: Lost Coast is a cut section of the highway 17 chapter in the original Half Life 2 where you are taken to a city St.Olga where you are tasked to take down a combine artillery launcher who is shooting down headcrabs into the town.

As stated before it's incredibly short. It took me 10 minutes to finish the entire chapter and it's still incredibly fun. 

The reason this was released was to showcase the incredible range rendering and the new feature which was implemented into future valve games, the commentary mode. 

Since you get this for free if you own Half Life 2 I see no reason not to check it out. It's still Half Life and it's still great. 

Final Rating:
7/10 - Play It

4060,Nice little game.
4061,DAT. UPDATE.
4062,What the fuck this is terrible why would you even buy this ????????????????????????
4063,ok ya im stuck and im like WHY?!?
4064,"The game isn't exactly a game, but more of a dlc. This is more of a game for the people who want to shoot off all your weapons, deystroy a helicopter, and kill a bunch of combine soldiers. Eitherway, I still liked it"
4065,Waste
4066,"Wow, that was great! Awesome commentary great insight into the game development. Kinda wish there was more to walk around and exlpore though while the commentary goes on, but still. 

If you're a fan of half-life, or game development in general, give this a quick playthough."
4067,A nice little look into the making of hl2 it comes with the hl2 so play it if you want cause I got a fair amount of enjoyment out of lost coast
4068,oyunun amacı yok ama olablr yani
4069,"All Half-Life based games have been always goodgames! That's it. Thanks Valve!
10/10"
4070,"Funny little mission that takes around 10 mins to finish. Not quite sure what it is, but it's good for playing when you're doing something else."
4071,The only problem is: Too short!
4072,Small but fun
4073,"For one, it's only 15 min long...
I could make a better mod than this...
Second: There is no chalange besides destorying all the combine inside.
And last but not least! Third... The fucking helechoper is a reskinned gunship!

Then again I can't really say shit because this was an Add to HL2 in 2004...

Plus, there is no story to this like... How did he end up there? Why is he helping this random stranger that could be a combine spy, he's an old guy, in plane site, where the combine could shoot him down... And last, if Freeman really got knocked out and tossed to the end of the coast, how dose he still have his suit!?
I mean I know he had his suit the rest of the games but COME ON! He's lost at sea, he woke up on a pile of rocks with a bunch of broken boats, and he still has his suit... His suit would have pealed off and shorted out but the time he got there..."
4074,✔️
4075,Well since this is from half life 2 its a good start of half life 3 and this is just a hint from valve.
4076,Fantastic addition. Wish it had gone somewhere....where HL3?
4077,it is a very fun game and not very long but im just saying £26.99 for this i got half life 2 for like £6.99 and that is longer then this so WHAT?!?!?! come on valve u can do better :)
4078,The game would have much more players if for the graphics considering made form like 1990
4079,"In these ^ hours that I have, I learned how to speed run this game."
4080,i really enjoyed the fisherman
4081,"Got bored in 5 minutes. sorry Gaben, dont take away my p250 muertos plox"
4082,"Me encanta los nuevos graficos que le pusieron al juego. Me gusto la introduccion a como realizaron nuevos cambios en el juego.

I love this level, the art in the gothic church and all! i love the reflections in the water and in the glasses, hope Valve can make more of this kind of mods, that shows the graphics game

And Gabe..... 3..... 1,2.3."
4083,Good Game :v !
4084,"I guess Lost Coast is a cut episode (or something like that) that was suppose to be in Half-Life 2 but was removed. Not sure why but it was interesting. Sadly it was WAY too short, but i guess theres a reason to this. I can recommend it, but its not really necessary to get it unless you want to and at this point its only available through packages so if you got most of the valve games (especially the trilogy of Half Life 2) you would probably throw possibly around $30 down the drain just for this (depends which package you are buying from). The challenge is fairly good, so if you are that kind of person then go for it."
4085,"I don't recommend getting this on it's own, or if you haven't played HL2. It's more of a tech demo than a real game (you will be able to try out all of the guns on enemies).

The only reason I recommend getting this is if you want to own all of the HL2 content."
4086,"Its very very short, but shows off some really great rendering. Highly reccomend it if you are into Half Life, or just love some pretty scenery."
4087,Iam Lost in the Lost Coast Jokes
4088,"I liked Half-Life 2: Lost Coast the most because it is the shortest game of all the other Half-Life Games
"
4089,Still not Half-Life 3.
4090,"Lost Coast: a nice demo, and actually pretty fun to play. The one little nugget that was missing from Half-Life 2. It has a nice atmosphere and well made effects (for 2005).

At the start of the demo, it feels like you're taking a little vacation from the main story of Half-Life 2. Though short I do recommend it, cause I wouldn't have want to miss this :)"
4091,Nice Tec-demo. No story.
4092,"WHERE AM I?
WHO ARE YOU?
THE HELL IS GOING ON?
you shoot stuff"
4093,"For a tech-demo, it's a pretty good game."
4094,Too short.
4095,"1 pack with Half-Life 2, this game tells how Source Engine works."
4096,BEST GAME EVER
4097,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Buy Half Life 2 as it comes free with it.
4098,Cool game to play that doesnt take forever to pass. Just play and enjoy
4099,"I got this as a part of the orange box, which I bought for ten american dollars. Thats a good deal, but forty dollars on steam is ridiculous, even for me being a half life fan since 1999. This isnt even long enough to be considered a level. Dont get me wrong, its cool, and the difficulty is high, giving any hl player a challenge. But to buy this alone would be crazy."
4100,"It's so fucking good but also so FKING SHORT like you finish this ""game"" in 25 min or even less, I probably wasted more time adjusting the graphics than actually finishing the game. I'm very sad for it not having a bigger story. I'm all up for the game but all down for it lenght."
4101,"The Graphics were amazing. But one thing i want to say, if the graphics were this good in 2005, then the graphics in [Deleted Content] sure as hell be advanced!"
4102,"7/10 - Super short demo - Fun while it lasts

Just like Half-Life. A short Island demo

This doesn't cost $40, I believe it's a complete bundle.

This part alone is worth nothing. Free with Half-Life.

4105,"Lost Coast is a small technology demo showing off the Source engine's HDR rendering capabilities and it is an additional map originally planned as a section of the chapter Highway 17 of Half-Life 2, but was dropped. Only download this if you like Half Life or Source Engine.(Includes Gaben's Email inside)"

4112,"Compelling storyline, long and thorough campaign. Better than HL2"
4113,"At the time of release this was an awesome tech demo, that made me feel like I ""got"" alot of the decisions made in the development of half life two (and later episodes.)

Now it stands as an awesome testament to when Valve USED to make games.


(please make games again)
"
4114,The Loast Coast is a fun and nice insight in the development process.
4115,"It's a showcase of technology developed at the time.  And it's free.

Sure, check it out.  They did some work and it was an interesting experience."
4116,fucking shit wouldnt play no gud 1/99
4117,Prettiest 15 minutes of Half Life 2
4118,The game isn't $39.99.
4119,kekmentary is interesting
4120,This is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me
4121,This is basicly a tec demo but fun all the same
4122,"The game is a free level that was cut from the game that comes with Half-Life 2 when you buy it. It features great graphics and environments showing what the Source engine is capable of. The game is very simple and short and features shooting, climbing, puzzles and a small boss fight with a chopper. The game is a fun experience and lets you enjoy the great graphics while playing."
4123,"So uh, you really don't have to get this one. I mean, it's not BAD so I'll say sure, but this game is like Half-life 2's slightly autistic brother. Story in it is kinda shit and it's literally only one map, but meh, again, it's not BAD."

Still wondering 10/10"
4130,"Not good at all the game play is like 2 minutes long has a bad discrpiction on where Gordan ended up because in HL1 and 2 Gordan does not go on a boat and go to an isand to find a creepy old guy also no sight of Alex,Barneyand Kliner or anybody else so in conclusion this is not a good game but if you want to play a short HL game then play this"
4131,Short like this review. 80/100 no story
4132,it is okay but it still was fun and all but it came with half life 2 so it is recommend
4133,As close as you can get to lord Gaben
4134,Pretty cool tech demo. Worth the 1/2 hour of gameplay if you are interested in video game development and listen to all of the dev commentary.
4135,Now understand why I got it for free...

4139,"[u][b]-Quick Review-[/b][/u]
Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was used as a “Technology demonstration” showing the graphics, style, lightning, combat, and generally demonstrating the Source Engine in Half-Life 2. Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was developed by Valve the same time that Half-Life 2 was being developed, Lost Coast was released on steam in 2005.


[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]
[b]Story:[/b] Some people might be asking “Atratzu, why are you reviewing this? It's not even a full game, it's a demo”. My answer is... I dunno... It's a game in my library and I want to review every game I've played.
There's not much to the story, you meet an old man [i](the fisherman)[/i] who takes you up a flight of stairs to unlock a gate to let you up to the chapel. Then you get ambushed by the Combine and need to demonstrate the amazing Half-Life 2 source engine to those jerks and kick their butts.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Keep in mind that this game came out in 2005. Today and in the future a Technical demo like this might seem silly, but at the time it was dazzling 3D graphics to onlookers.
The controls are the same as Half-Life 2... First person view, different types of weapons can be found and switched between using the scroll wheel or 1-2-3-4-5-etc, pew pew.

[b]Achievements:[/b] This game has the hardest achievements out of any video game I've ever played. They're broken down into one category: unforgivingly difficult. Beat the whole game in extreme-FUBAR-murder-death-mode. Play for 1,000 hours. Reach notorious hidden objectives, slay the hidden spider queen, and many more.

Actually, there aren't any achievements in the game.

[b]Price:[/b] Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is priced at $39.99, for the stand alone game, it's crazy, isn't it? Imagine how much fun you could have with a game from 2005 for $39.99? I think that's a solid price, I think Valve could get away with charging an extra hundred dollars for the game and it would still be worth it.

Actually, it's part of a bundle with 9 other games within the “Buy Half-Life Complete”.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] To quickly recap, the story was short and not really relevant, since this was taken out of Half-Life 2 (this was supposed to be a section of Highway 17). The Gameplay was identical to Half-Life 2 because it was basically a town in Half-Life. The Achievements were non-existent. The price is non-existent because it comes in a bundle with other games.
“Should you get this game?” That question is irrelevant, “Should you buy and play the Half-Life Games?” Heck yes."
4140,this dlc or addon is 10 minutes long its fucking great
4141,"*NORMAL VERSION* this game is by far the prettiest of all of them. altough i dont recommend to buy it at full, you should wait for it to be on sale.
*MY VERSION* why the hell is the game so expesive? why is it so damn pretty? whats the story? WHY IS THIS A THING?"
4142,"I never thought I would have so much fun on a ""documentary"".

Its awesome."
4143,where is the found coast
4144,It was good and it was a suprise hearing gabens voice in game and listening to the devs talk about their work
4145,"Its free, has cool new visuals and a fun quick mission. Worth an hour of your time"
4146,"A well done demonstration of older source HDR capabilities and some insider advice on the overall creative process behind the half life series.  Although pretty short, its still worth playing if your somewhat curious.

Hopefully valve will continue to produce these smaller snippets with other games they release."
4147,nice
4148,"This game came with my copy of HL2 so yeah.

At the time I played this, I was still fighting the metro-cops near this the beginning of HL2, so immedeatly being faced with the combine soldiers was an interesting experience. And those cramped paths though...

9/10 is a bit short but still enjoyable"
4149,Jesus approves
4150,"Great tech demo, very simple, yet informative. Dev commentary by Valve is always the best."
4151,"Its a technical demo, and thats all it is. Its incredibly short so dont be expecting any major plot twists. However there is commentary by none other than gabe newell, so thats a plus!"
4152,"It was free with half life 2 and it adds props to gmod
worth it 10/10"
4153,Great level to show-Of the source engine!
4154,not worth the money
4155,"My hardware are now burn and melting plastic case lol
10/10 nice work Valve keep it up."
4156,Guys...this IS HL2 Ep 3.
4157,"A nice little way to spend 15 minutes. Great Graphics. Everything awesome. Wish it was a bit longer. But still,"
4158,Короткое путешествие в мир Халф Лайф +++++
4159,"Thought it was a continuation of the HL2-series - was disappointed. 

+for gaben commentary"
4160,I HERE GABEN VOICE IN THE MOUNTAINS XDDDDDDDD
4161,Awesome little half life chapter!
4162,"HL2 Lost Coast is a DLC/Demo of HL2
It might be 6 minutes of gameplay but still... 9/10 For a Demo"
4163,I actually enjoyed playing this game an hour before I got my PC fixex :D
4164,"My guess is you're probably playing this because you got it for free along with Half-Life 2. I know that's why I played it. I didn't know what to expect going in, except the occaisional online comment. Half Life 2: Lost Coast is, basically, a deleted scene. A level that didn't end up making into the actual Half Life 2 game. And if they're including this for free now, I find it a little odd that Valve doesn't just throw it in as an option on the main menu. But that's just me nitpicking. Is it fun? Yes. Just like the entirety of Half Life 2 was, bundled into a short 20 minute playthrough. Is it necessary? No. 

I suppose that's the joy of deleted scenes. It can really show who's smart and dumb in the entertainment buisness when it comes to what's exactly deleted. You've got the dumb ones like Lord of the Rings that throws out Saruman's last stand and the Amazing Spider-Man 2 which deleted all the important story scenes. And then there are the smart ones like Star Wars and Half Life 2, which you can go back and appreciate their deleted scenes for exaclty what they are. Would this have been fun in Half-Life 2? Sure. But it wouldn't add too much to the plot, so it's understandable."
4165,ok
4166,"BADU GABEN

11/10

FISHERMAN IS GOOD TOO LIKE A FRESH SPAGHETI"
4167,"A tech demo, so don't buy it by itself or you will recieve the whole Hl2 series.

Buy Hl2 and the episodes if you haven't already and prepare for hours of fun.

Play this after Hl2, then move on to the episodes. Lost Coast comes with Hl2."
4168,"Gaben is the main villain and he's using the power of advanced lighting and shaders to stop you from raiding a Combine outpost where a headcrab mortar is being used to terrorise a village nearby. After you have thwarted the combine threat, Gaben, now piloting a helicopter, battles you on the cliffside whilst explaining how to send him an email.

10/10 - Valve"
4169,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
4170,Still not Half-Life 3.
4171,Very nice
4172,1 chapter but fun
4173,"I rate the expansion/add-on to Half Life 2: Lost Coast 2/5.

This is a very short (though free through Steam) little area that would have probably been nice to have somewhere in the original game (especially when considering how short Half Life 2 was). No major bugs, very linear, feels pretty true to the ambience of the main game but I wish Lost Coast was seamlessly integrated into the main game."
4174,"Although it's a damn short game, only clocking in at around 30 minutes to 1 hour at the most, I was really interested to know how the process of developing a game was like. To do that, you need to turn commentary on. This commentary came straight from the developers from Valve, like Gary McTaggart, Robin Walker, and Chris Green. After playing and listen to what they had to say, I understood the process of making a game a little bit more. As far as graphics and level design go, I would give it an A."
4175,"way too short
"
4176,A very enjoyble experience.
4177,"I beat it in under 10 mins. Not worth my time, hl2 was a lot better than this"
4178,10/10 You can find the map files from the actual game and put them in gmod and play Half Life 2 without buying it! :D
4179,"Was too short, but worth it because i was 2 sneaky 4 combines.
I also battled a gunship reskinned with Hunter Chopper.

GG 10/10"
4180,Half-Life: 2 Lost Coast is in all reality a short developer commentary mixed with a small side task. You help a fisherman by taking a monastery back from Combine control. Along the way are audio nodes that let you hear about how the environment around you is created. Overall it is a great way to get insight on how amazing the source engine is for its time.
4181,"Truly the most magical of all the Halflife games thus far, this game will provide MINUTES of gameplay! There's simply no reason not to play this game!"
4182,So Small yet so joyful
4183,"It's a small level and only takes about 20-30 minutes depending on how you play but it does offer what that classical Half-Life gameplay. You can also turn on developer commentary which is also quite interesting. It's a free tech demo so if you've got it, give it a go!"
4184,"Just a demo and graphical test. Nothing else to be said.

"
4185,"Short, Sweet, and to the point."
4186,"I played it for a bit.
Its ok"
4187,"Not a game, just showcases HDR technology...
Waiting for HL3..."
4188,"short but amazing game!
"
4189,"I shoved a large candlestick into an automatic extra-terrestrial cannon fireing venomous parsitic alien lifeform (brethren of Lamar, pet of Kleiner) to save an inncocent fishing town at the instrucation of an odd British fisherman while being soothed by the voice of Gabe Newell and company.

I enjoyed it"
4190,"I wish there was more, it was so short, once I finished I went back to check for easter eggs etc... didn't really find anything."
4191,"I recommend this small episode completely!! You'll finish it in half an hour but it is amazing. There is this particular part of the game where you get embushed by the combine, you'll recall those amazing fights in ""Follow Freeman"" episode one more brilliant time. Definetely recommended! Enjoy :)"
4192,"Comes free with Half Life 2, won't take you longer than 30 minutes to complete, but be sure to play through with developer commentary switched on, stuff they talk about is pretty interesting."
4193,"It's never dull gunning down the Combine, even if only for an hour."
4194,short
4195,"What I did:
1) Found out gaben is in the commentary
2) Listened to gaben's beautiful voice
3) Stole the fisherman's spear and gravity gunned into the sea (which is filled with deadly stuff)
4) Killed some combine
5) Got to a church
6) Jammed a pole, bike and bucket into the machine
7) Killed more combine
8) Did an Arnold and got to the chopper then shot it down
9) Got the lift (or elevator) stuck on a cliff by shooting it with the grav gun
10) Freed it making me fall out and die
11) Hears the words ""you've done it freeman""
12) Goes down normally
13) The fisherman has his spear (wizard?)
14) Shoots him with a rpg...twice
15) Throws a grenade as I fade away

10/10 Best 10 minutes with gaben ever."
4196,Whats this_
4197,"Now when you step outside you can't see shit, just like real life.
10/10 would blink again
(But seriously it's more Half Life 2, what else do you want?)"
4198,"so i walked up to the combine and said ''whatd up i gotta big COCK! im so hot that your mommas a dingling and i just drewlerd all over myself'' so i give the game 1023w40-230400320r420305r40ew04ospapoop34w99532498489328948e294e923-34i9eruiehdsiufouiwehdsyigvuefjacuosdfiuae

4199,I want continuation!!
4200,Gaben?
4201,"woke up on beach, walked mountain while in firefight, sovled puzzles, more firefights, then had to take down helicopter. Then got home and saw HL:LC was in my library and saw this is what HL:3 was gonna use and said ""cool"" 10/10 would walk in firefight again."
4202,"really short only worth it if comes with large pack.
"
4203,"This is a Tech Demo Game of the classic Valve first person shooter single person campaign.

 You don't need it , it was not part of the original Half-Life 2 story.  It was given out free in certain bundles.  Has developer commentary mode.

The extra short story of Gordon Freeman.

 Exploreable environments and useable / moveable objects, voiceover actors with alternate conversations. Is linear but you can explore alittle of each map. Autosave works good. 

Has a Short story."
4204,"OGM THS GAME IS THE BEST GAME VER!@!@

YOU SHOULD BGUITN IT RIGHT NOW EOMGMGGEE@#!$%)@!%)(

Just kidding, it's a tech demo.

Still, you get some nice insight into the developers' mindset as they explain design choices and engine mechanics.I would say get it for the commentary if you're into that sort of thing."
4205,"it's fun and gives you 15 minutes of enjoyment, but its just a tech demo. a 40$ tech demo."
4206,"my ears have been blessed by the one and only lord Gaben

4207,"$39.99






WHAAAAAAAAAAT?!?!?


Good game 10/6."
4208,gaben we love u only for half life series but we hate u cuz of dota 2 !!! =)
4209,Well its just a great thing about what we will see in half life 2 episode one and two so dont expect a lot from it. I mean its only 15 minutes to complete it. If you dont include the dev commentary. But i recommend including the dev commentary so you will learn about the source engine more =)
4210,"This morning, i did not know what HDR was.  Now I do.  Make more!"
4211,Worse than Warface
4212,"cost 5x times more than Half life 2
got it 2010 for free with HL2:DM

Saved 34,99 Euros"
4213,Very short but FUN!
4214,Longest shit I`ve ever played.
4215,"Pretty sure this was on the store for a high price.

If im wrong im sorry. 

But don't buy this alone or something. I don't even think you can anymore.

It's just a showcase of the lighting capabilities of hl2 in a little dlc.

idk.

ill pass.

I could do without it."
4216,Good
4217,"This game is amazing.

Physics,HDR and user interaction all work perfectly with this short game.

If you wan't a copy of this don't buy it just get Half-Life 2. Then again, who doesn't already own a copy of Half-Life 2? And no that's not a zinger a copy of this 30 dollar game comes with a copy of Half-Life 2 for free meaning the price tag has accidentally been kept the same for years. The more you know. Did you know Lost Coast is the least played game on Steam with 99% of those that own this game never playing this game let alone istalling it? ...I can't believe anybody has even seen my review for this. It's short and sweet but nothing special. It's so short in fact that you should take a nap instead.

http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/320"
4220,I don't know why I played this game.. I just did.
4221,The engine features presented in this short tech demo are nothing special by today's standards but the demo is still worth playing for the insightful developer commentary.
4222,"Well a little short, a little simple, but it does show what its supposed to show, the engine."
4223,"[h1]It is a good tech demo and a nice benchmark for the Source Engine, Get it to complete your game library, or to benchmark your video card.
"
4224,Beautiful short game used as a graphics test.
4225,the shortest half-life game made. beat it in 2 minutes. ah who cares its gordon freeman and this game is kind of the expansion between half-life2 and half-life episode 1. so i can not hate on this game too much.
4226,WOrth 40 dollars.
4227,HALF LIFE!
4228,the game sucked. it seems only fraction of it was completed
4229,should be longer i guess
4230,"Snippet of some of the HL2 gameplay. Very short and I do wonder why this was added but hey, free 20 minutes of gameplay."
4231,10/10 Gaben gives you his email
4232,just a small and nice level for half life 2.
4233,Cool little showcase to see the technologies that Valve developed to make some of the Half-Life games
4234,People spent money on this
4235,I would like to rate up this map (it is a map is not a game Hλlf life 2 is the official game) but the only thing that is keeping from not to do it is that it is SUPER SHORT do not buy the map itself i bought Hλlf life 2 episode pack and it came with it.I will rate up this map if it is included on Hλlf life 3
4236,"I mean, it comes with Half-Life 2.  It isn't meant to be a standalone game for the Half-Life franchise.  Like the description says, it's a showcase for the technology.  I'd feel bad if I gave this a bad rating just because it isn't supposed to be an amazing game.  It's like a trial run.  In all honesty, there are some parts that Valve could have removed that would render this demo without much of a story.  However, I don't mind the story and it isn't that amazing I guess.  The gameplay was really good though as it is was meant to be a level for Half-Life 2.  If you have some free time (like twenty minutes or so), I can guarantee that you will blast through this demo.  For me, it mostly just reaffirmed the feelings I had about Half-Life 2 and its engine."
4237,Looks beatufiul and I got to know more about how my favourite game (Half-Life 2) was made! :)
4238,very nice little addon to half-life 2 and it was free so even better.
4239,"This is only a one chapter game. It was intended to be included in the chapter Highway 17 in the final game, but it was dropped out, so now it's only used as a video stress test map to show off the Source engine's performance.

10/10"
4240,Its the E-3 demo for half life 2 yay!!!!!!!!!
4241,Took me less than an hour and adds nothing. Yawn
4242,∞/10. This game is his money worth. Enough said.
4243,"I don`t recommend buying it on it`s own, unless you feel like buying one chapter of gameplay with a commentary. It`s the only title on the orange box with a gameplay shorter than portal other than half life 2 episode one."
4244,"Ciekawy pomysł na pokazanie możliwości pracy silnika graficznego, czyli ukazanie tych możliwości wkładając je do gry której fabułę i rozgrywkę zna każdy i każdy z niej się cieszył.

Fakt, że minieło już kilka dobrych lat, a niedługo wychodzi source2, wiec licze na to, że valve nie zawiedzie i ukaże nam możliwości source2 nie tylko na Portalu3 (wraz z vr) ale i half life 3 :D

A co do tytułu... całkiem przyjemnyd dodatek który pokazuje ze valve nie śpi i wciąż pracuje :D"
4245,Very short game play but was very informitive with the commentary on.
4246,Cool test I enjoyed I listned to the commentary and wet myself when I heard Lord Gabben and then he said his email at the end YESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4247,"Nice show-off of the amazing graphics that valve has designed.

7/10"
4248,I dont recomend this at all (only if you play on the computer for like 10 - 15 minutes per a day) well if you do play for it for 10 - 15 well play this game it will be fun but after a long time of playing it will get boring and also this is'nt like $40 only if you had pre ordered the orginal half life 2 and costed like 40 to 30 $$$ (if you that person i will give it a 6/10).And now the bit what im at i play on the computer for liek 5 houres and one day i get hl2 and i played this game and it was fun i used to speedrun the game but know its just boring nothing new you can get %100 in 1 houre and your finshed (but this one more thing speedruning like i said) but know to day i will give it 1/10 its rubish dont buy it unless you play pc for 10 to 15 minuted
4249,"A riveting story about a fisherman and a sceintist who save a town from augemented trans-humans.


In reality, it's an unrealeased DLC turned into a tech demo. It'll take ya 10 minutes without listening to the commentary (which bored me to death in under 2 minutes)."
4250,"This is a standalone mission that has no place in the Half-Life canon that I know of. It's really a neat showcase for how good the next installment would look. I think. Anyway, it's a short, lively battle sequence that gives you combine soldiers, a helicopter, and scripted explosions and such. Its very fun, get it if you feel you need more after Episode 2. Voice actor of Father Grigory is a fisherman in this :3"
4251,
4252,"A pretty solid tech demo

Plus GabeN is in it"
4253,Like Candy
4254,Wow. I am so happy I got this game for free! But don't buy it for $40! It took me like an hour to beat the entire game. Kinda dissapointing but whatever.
4255,wat
4256,Wait whats the point of this.
4257,"I can only say positive things about this extension. While short, it is still entertaining as it captures all of the aspects of the features included within the Half Life games, as well as an explanation as to how they are rendered. It would be fantastic if things like this was included with future titles in the Half Life series. To give it a numerical rating, 9/10"
4258,Good
4259,I think the fisherman is the G-Man you can't fool me valve!
4260,"I got this for free through buying HL2, Why in the hell would I pay 40$ to play the tutorial with out the actual game?
Just get Half life 2 (Unless you want to get the HL Complete or the the Valve Complete pack) and install this before you play the game. It is good at getting pumped up. But buying a 15min tutorial voiced by Gaben for ""39.99"" as the the first package is also ""39.99."" I wonder if this is actuialy a good deel."
4261,Note: this is not a normal game but still a game. It's not a long game but if you like Half-life 2 should you check this out.
4262,"Okay on what gameplay there is, but it's extraordinarly short (like, 1-2 hours if you're taking your time and die a lot)"
4263,Not much still fun
4264,I'm not exactly sure why this game was made but it's fun and it's finishes very quickly but because I'm a big fan for Valve Source games enjoyed it.
4265,"Was thirsty, died from acid water
10/10"
4266,"Really should have reviewed this years ago.

A short tech demo: Why didn't they add the hardware lighting effects to HL2?

Mostly use it to benchmark my system when I install new hardware.  First time I got about 30fps @ 1024x768 (no AA.)  Now I get 183fps @ 1920x1080 with everything maxed out.

Just remember, it's free with hl2 (or some of the DLC.)  Enjoy what hl2 should look like."
4267,"not hl3 and only last ten miniutes, but its worth it if you get the orange box.
also has lots of resources that are great to have in gmod"
4268,The best tech demo ever created.
4269,"Given alongside HL2. Provides some cool insight to how developers work out levels and is a nice, small, additional level to explore"
4270,"Liked the gaame, just wish they would expand it more than the 1 area. Need to keep it a part of half-life 2 but have it's own stand alone chapter that could lead into a chapter 3 for half-life 2."
4271,"Very good ""peace"" of the game.They do very intresting details ,I had never seen something like that. 10 of 10"
4272,its awsome
4273,"I did not find Half Life 3



Maybe next tech demo."
4274,"Lost has 4 letters
Coast has 5 letters
5 - 4 = 1
1 + 2 = 3

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast IS Half-Life 3!"
4275,The greatest installment in the ongoing adventures of Gordon Freeman. Worth the $59.99.
4276,I dont remeber buying this. or any pack that had anything to do with this
4277,"Probably the best game of the Half-Life series in some aspects, I'm not surprised that people are begging for a third installment, but this one's replay value is enough to hold fans over."
4278,"What? 40 bucks?
What if someone bought this instead of HL2?"
4279,"If you enjoyed Half-Life 2, this is more of the same.  That said, this is the single shortest game I've ever played.  I'm very slow at completing games, and this one took me 20 minutes.  In fairness, this was supposed to be a small add-on to Half-Life 2 that Valve intended as a demo of some of its graphics capabilities."
4280,Pointless...
4281,"This is NOT way to buy this. But it is possibly some of the best 15 min in the HL2 games. Great gameplay, good graphics, if you really want this, though, buy the Orange Box. This is in there with Portal 1, HL2, HL2ep1, HL2ep2, and a free hat for TF2."
4282,"Don't pay $40 for this tech demo, you get it free when you buy Half Life 2."
4283,BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO HEAR GABE NEWELLS VOICE!
4284,Way to easy and way to short but it was fun! :D
4285,I don't know how I got this game.
4286,I walked on a island.
4287,its overpriced for just a level demo.
4288,"Take me now Gabe<3"""
4289,i just realized that this is technically half life 3.
4290,"It's really good, but before I knew it was a demo I thought, :This game is short and expensive!"" But it is really good for a demo."
4291,Noice
4292,I actually liked it but i didnt waste me 40 bucks. When i buyed hl2ep1 it came with it and some other games from hl.
4293,"Half life 3 confirmed
"
4294,"Just a 10 minute tech demo with commentary. It's more Half Life and you get to hear Gaben. I got it for free so it's not bad, but just don't even bother with this unless you have absolutely nothing better to do.

4/10"
4295,"A showcase of shitty graphics effects from late 2000-something. An amazing town can be seen in the distance, but I can't explore it. Sad face."
4296,"Not really a game, more explaining how they do things in HL2, and why. Shows off the graphics a lot and is pretty cool to play for a bit. Only took me 20 mins to complete, but a fun little thing to have a look at if you're bored!

10/10 - Nice Graphics and GABEN! :D"
4297,"this tech demo thingy is better than many of the shitty greenlit games on steam, i most definetaly enyoyed every single bit of it. and i also got to hear gabens voice, and i got his email ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) so what can i ask more for. this is the best 18 minutes i have spent in a tech demo in my life 10/10"
4298,xddd
4299,wut
4300,"Seriously, valve, why is this a thing? 
"
4301,"This was an essentially a test mod for High Dynamic Range lighting (HDR) which was new technology at the time of release. As a game it doesn’t offer much more than a set of scenarios to show off various situations in which HDR is used. very short and quite pointless. if you are a half-life completionist, you may be interested to learn about this level that is essentially a stripped down cut version of the Highway 17 level in HL2, however don’t pay a huge amount of money for it as it adds next to no replay value"
4302,that much for lost coast? just get it with half life you will be fine
4303,"It's a HL2 technology demo of new HDR thing that was introduced into Source Engine back then. You get to play some small level, that was originally scrapped from Half-Life 2. It comes free with all HL2 purchases.

Nothing much to say about this that can't be said about HL2. Enviroment is superb and makes good use of contrast and thus gives a nice HDR impression. Some small fights. Blowing ragdolls of soldiers off cliff with rocket launcher. Boss fight. Stuff. Nice things.
HDR is effect simulating your eye pupils getting used to current brightness of enviroment, for example, making bright spot appear very shiny if you was wandering in dark for a while.

Oh. And it comes with developer commentary. For first time ever. Which is the best because it's the only commentary that doesn't talk all time about voice acting, since there is very little dialog to begin with."
4304,"ok this game was lie ok... first i spawn 100 hp ???!!! that not HALF LIFE that full life ok ... and then this game say LOST COAST EXPLICITLY IN THE TITLE but what ??? u start in coast = coast found, check mates athierts .... also gamer was a lot similor to game called ruster with mekanics and many hacors no funny get 20 shottedf but i have FULL LIFE so is ok , gg a loter simmalr to game of simlor genra called half-life if u nio heard it go look up , 7/10 with windors xd 8/11"
4305,"[b]Half-Life 2: Lost Coast[/b] is a short and brief tech demonstration showcasing the new mechanics and posibilities of the Source Engine used in [b]Half-Life 2[/b] itself, as well as giving you a brief introduction of what the core game itself is like. The segment used here was originally planned to be a part of the original game but was ultimately cut and used as the demo for the game instead, it's short and sweet, a nice and effective demo."
4306,"Welcome to false hopes, broken dreams, and a whole lot of crying. 
Half Life 3 - It's never coming out."
4307,It's a great segment that I think would have went well with the game. It was nicely designed and thought out. But one more thing- where is Half Life Episode Three?! :P
4308,When i heard gaben i think i did somthing magicial in my pants :)
4309,Pretty nice remake of the first Half-Life version. Had loads of fun! Great game!
4310,Leeches 10/10 ~IGN  honestly this demo is okay but it needs to be updated soon!
4311,Short but sweet
4312,WTF?! 40 FUCKING DOLLARS FOR 7 MINUTES OF GAMEPLAY BRAVO
4313,Like Dark Souls beta
4314,"Th..That's So fast...

8.5/10"
4315,"Small game, But BIG fun"
4316,"I change my mind, the commentary was fun."
4317,"way to long, it took me almost as long as half life 2 to beat"
4318,I got it for free/10
4319,"I'm not sure if this was only supposed to be a single scenario or not.
If it was, I'm glad I didn't purchase it separately as there's nothing more to do after the first one!???
Very short and sweet!"
4320,güzel bir teknoloji demosu
4321,"I... guess... it's decent, even though I don't understand why it wasn't just a DLC, considering it's all of 10 minutes."

4323,It left me really wanting more gabe put out more stuff like this its amazing
4324,"Nice short level to showcase their new use of high-dynamic-range rendering. Sad it was only 12 mins worth of gameplay. Not grading this as there was not much to go by. Did have some trouble with some rendering at the start of the level on the dock talking to the old man. Would get flashes of black on some of the farther particles, all went away after the level started.
Could of been longer."
4325,"Pretty good game
too short though
8/10"
4326,"[h1]Half Life 2: Lost Coast Tech Demo - Is it worth the $0?[/h1]
[b]Half Life 2: Lost Coast[/b] is a tech demo showing off some of the pretty graphical gameplay that was for the Source Engine. HL2: LC was a removed chapter from Half Life 2, and instead just a tech demo that everyone can enjoy.  If you're willing to experience on what this Tech Demo is supposed to be, then you must own Half Life 2 (BASE) in order to play as it's the only way to get this Demo. This Demo is exactly like Half Life 2, but it excludes STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS to gain, and in order to play the story, you have to install HL 2 and the Demo itself in order to play the story. HL2: LC doesn't change the story at all, nothing has changed in the story .bsp files excluding the lc map.

Half Life 2: Lost Coast is also moddable for some reason, as it's just the same exact copy of Half Life 2.
So, is Half Life 2: Lost Coast worth the $0? Of course! It's free if you own HL2.

10/10"
4327,"somehow better, more enjoyable and worth my time than hunt down the freeman.

and its a fucking tech demo"
4328,"BY JOVE, this game is SO SHORT. In fact, IT'S ONLY ONE MAP!! But it does tell a story. And supplies everyone with a really depressing ending. Well, I found it sad. Kinda."
4329,it's like skyrim with a tech demo
4330,"Good for relaxation - 10/10, game you can finish in [b]10[/b] minutes."
4331,Best Game Ever Made 10/10
4332,Say no to paid mods!
4333,"[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaka9lag/recommended/ ] My Review :[/url]

Rate : 10/10

Lost Coast is a small technology demo showing off the Source engine's HDR rendering capabilities and it is an additional map originally planned as a section of the chapter Highway 17 of Half-Life 2, but was dropped. Only download this if you like Half Life or Source Engine or waiting for Half Life 3.  


This game (or demo) is included with the purchase of Half-Life 2. Game doesn't cost $39.99 USD, ""Half-Life Complete"" does!"
4334,what the fook am i downloading 2 gbs of?!?!
4335,"Despite the misleading price tag, this is a free game bundled with other half life games that Valve made to showcase the Source Engine. It lasts about 15-20 min and is a fun little snippet of half-life gameplay with commentary from the developers. This was never intended to be a full game and is not connected to any other half life game in the series (other than being set in the same universe). It's great when I don't have an hour or so to spend gaming and just want a quick run-and-gun done in Valve style. If your considering buying the bundled consider this a great bonus chapter."
4336,"Downvoted only due to the following:

The practice of paying for mods is antithetical to the nature of the modding community; an optional ""DONATION"" button is not (Just like on the Nexus http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/? ). Was a fun game, The fact that Valve is doing this and that Bethesda is endorsing it and they both taking the largest share of the modders' work is American Corporate greed at it's finest.

Take something artistic and done for the love of the subject matter, monetize it, then allow the accountants to define art as widgets, and then creativity is now run by the mercantile class, the middle men, who are ""America Corporates"".

If they had any integrity and decency, any moneys brought in, at the very least, should be 100% donated to charities on behalf off the modding community in conjunction with Valve or Bethesda or whomever. See Gaben, you don't need the cash grab, you can win by getting good press which in the long run would do better for you to show you are not like EA et al."
4337,oh look its the least played game on stem lol
4338,A nice little insight into the development of the Source engine's parts.
4339,Got this with a 9.99$ game (Half Life 2) gg
4340,"Really good demonstration of Valve's work on visual effects. It is a short game that showcases their HDR tech, but it's also a fun level that could have made it into HL2."
4341,good game but short lol 7/10
4342,plz stfu gaben
4343,"$30 wasted, sorry but not worth it. Now I have $30 LESS dollars to spend on csgo skins, it goes to gabe either way but DAMNIT"
4344,Good game but way too short. As a added bonus it's got Bill from L4d2 in it! :D
4345,"this was a very quick game so I have not got much to say but it did have a fisherman and gordan and enemies and well.......stuff........errrr yeah it came bouns with my HL2 bundle so......yeah....
5/10 not really that special but still interesting"
4346,great expansion!
4347,I dont actually know what to say hmm.. Half-Life 2 Lost Coast i got for free when i bought Half-Life 2. I played Half-Life 2 Lost Coast before i actually played the whole game. Well its an short chapter and i like it. It´s an great map and alot of things that is built. Its very short but its worth You´r time if you are into these Half-Life games. Uhmm.. It should of been longer.
4348,Speedran it within 50 seconds.
4349,i finally know gaben's voice. well then..... hahah. well well..
4350,"It has Gaben's voice.

4352,"My favorite Half Life game. Really. It's actually really fun to just mess around on because it's just one small map. It can be speed runn(ed) in anywhere to 45 seconds to three minutes. You can easily discover all of its secrets and glitches, and overall is a very fun game.
While you're at it, buy Half Life 2."
4353,"Not really sure what the hell this is/was, but it's not a game. Okay, there is gameplay in it, but not enough to be worth installing or playing. Perhaps find someone doing a lets play of it or something if you are -really- interested in knowing what this is all about.

I might be missing something, but... I say don't play this. There's nothing really to play anyway."
4354,"Just for the record. This isn't game in this kind of word. It is just few minutes long showcase of some improved source engine with commentary. I recommend this for everyone who want to learn something about development.

[h1]As a bonus there is voice of LORD GABEN![/h1]"
4355,"Very very boring,

8/8 would undownload again"
4356,i dont even remember making a review for this wtf
4357,"I thought that this game was going to be like the other half life games, boy was I wrong. this piece of crap lasts about 5 minutes, no story, no goal, nothing but a wast of time"
4358,"It was actually deleted from the base game.
But in the end: It actually didn't go to waste.
They turned it into a free demo of the game.
It's a fantastic way to showcase the engine.
The base game received my positive review.
And I also need to give it to the Lost Coast.
Especially since it's basically a free bonus.
It even has a small story included in there.
And the atmosphere and visuals are great.
This was simply a very nice demo to play."
4359,Gabe Newell's voice made me cum for the first time in my life.
4360,+1
4361,"its an ok game, i thought i got a bonus game when i bought hl2 but this just ended up being a shitty test game! thanks Valve you fucking trolls"
4362,Have fun!
4363,Really just a demo level. Play it if you're desperate.
4364,Comes with HL2. Great developer commentary and good stress test.
4365,I got hl2 lost coast just by buying hl2 (i think) so I got it free!Anyway ithought it would be something like a campaign but NO! It is just some kind of level u do so u spend abot 20-30 minutes.I dont think u can buy just the hl2 Lost Coast . Although it is little i LOVED it!DEFINETLY recommend it
4366,"I heard Gabe's voice in game.

10/10"
4367,"Dont waste money on this, its not a game its a tech demo, probably about 10 mins long it ended so quick that did it all over again just to make sure i didnt mess somthing up. only upside is you get to hear lord gaben speak :)"
4368,"nice demo. good night, sweet gordon freeman"
4369,"Our PC lord GabeN speaks.
He also gives out his email.

8/8 M8
GabeN needs to speak more in the game."
4370,"half life 3 conferuimed
"
4371,I dunno. It's k.
4372,A fun extra non-canon level to Half-Life 2. It was mostly for showing off what they could achieve with Source back in the day.
4373,"This came with Half-Life 2, and I had never played it properly until now. It's an interesting look on what the Source engine has to offer, as well as a well-designed level. Very lovely."
4374,"What is this crap?  Developer commentry saying how water look pretty but when I go 3 metres above sea level I see wave slashing on skybox.

Final developer commentary say they make more like this but I see no other Day of Defeat: Lost Coast.  This is a waste of precious Afghani broadband, my affendi.  This idea clearly from era when George Bush was declaring war on the nation of Terroristan.  Even my camel laugh, and he laugh at no joke.  NO JOKE!"
4375,"Nothing beyond a tech demo/opportunity for the Valve devs to talk about their creative vision, but who cares? It's an awesome little side-game."
4376,"Its good but its just a teaser with not a lot of new gameplay. There is not even a half hour on this game, but once again its just a demo/teaser. I happen to like the fisherman character despite him not having much character development and I would love to see him in Episode 3. I love the narrow cliff sections, it makes this game actually have some diversity. In conclusion this game gets a 5.5/10, and I wouldn't be surprised if some of this stuff makes it in to Episode 3."
4377,Power
4378,"yessiri, 10/10"
4379,"Lost coast isn't something big, or another one of Valve's materpeices, it's just a stump. It's just ONE map with ONE goal, but in that short period of time, it is one hell of a fight against the combine, and an introduction to new Source things (have you seen the details they put into this game?). Some could even call it a minigame. In short, it's just something to pass the time in Gordon Freeman's world.
#Half-LifeFTW"
4380,a hard graft but its work it in this one you are a dredge the rivers but can you become the mouth of the river in time? polution is your enema
4381,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a demo, yet.. Interesting, money well spent. 8/10"
4382,Best of the best
4383,umm.......just look at my playtime
4384,"As of this moment, I have not yet beaten Half-Life 2. However, it came with this little gem that I like to call Lost Coast.

The main game itself is great, but for an absolutly free DLC, this game is pretty sweet. The level is pretty well designed, and even though it's really short, only took me 19 minutes, it was still really fun. Plus the little boss battle at the end is real satisfying, knowing how many times I died to that helicopter in the canal in the main game.

9/10"
4385,best most story enhancing game ever a must have!
4386,A bite-sized portion of Half-Life 2 that you can play when you're short on time and you still want some HL2 thrills.
4387,"Why is this now $40 AUD, it used to be free?

It's just a benchmark and one mission / map, it takes under 15 minutes to complete and shows off HDR."
4388,"A nice game/demo that reveals alot about the development process in Half-Life. This game also adds to the story of Half-Life, and it isn't that the same character either."
4389,not so lost
4390,I did gaben mode. 3/3 would gabe again
4391,i loved the ghraphics but i would have liked it better if there were alot more levels to play otherwise it is an awesome game
4392,this is fun dont know why it just is
4393,"I got this by surprise when I bought Half-Life 2, which was 75% off at the time. I had fun playing after Half-Life 2 was completed, and beat it in about 30 minutes.

Best $2.50 I ever spent."
4394,i like it
4395,gd
4396,"Damn that 20 Minutes of your time is worth it, totally"
4397,"sucks dick
"
4398,"This game isn't very long, however that's not the point of it. The point of it is rather to understand how the Source engine renders stuff and what the devs thought while developing Half-Life 2, which I found quite interesting. 
If you're interested in game development, or just want to hear GabeNs voice, this might be for you. If you enjoyed Half-Life 2 and want more of it... ...this isn't really for you.

4399,"FOLLOW THE STEPS!!! 
1) Start game
2)GET ON THE BOAT!! 
3)shift tab

4403,"This is a very short game. I bought the Half Life Franchise pack, so unless this is on sale for the lower price save your money. I Beat it in less then an hour,but it was very enjoyable. I didnt have high expectations of it being the same level as its predecessors so be aware. Its basically a one mission game, stop the gun turrent from attacking a town, fight the combine,fight a copter, figure out how to stop the turret, get back to where you started. BAM its over. 
I only recommend it because its a time killer game if youre bored and a half life fan boy."
4404,"A really brief, basic tech demo that is still entertaining and demonstrates how well the Source engine has stood the test of time."
4405,"Can't even switch weapons. Help? Unless you fix this, i'm not playing your broken mess.... come on valve, you pump out the masterpiece of HL2 and now this shit
EDIT: It works now. even though I changed literally nothing. Possibly this bug persists for other people? It's a short demo. not a lot of story, but good developer commentary. Only reason to get this ""game"" (demo)"
4406,People actually believe this game is $40.
4407,its a nice little show off but i dont recomend buying it its a great game only about a few minutes long but i recommend buying half-life2 its lost coast comes with it for free so dont buy this please just get half-life :D

4410,"This is a short cut level from Half-Life 2 used as developer commentary and showcasing tool.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*] You have all the guns from the get-go except the pulse rifle, which you get in 5 minutes
[*] Has developer commentary, which explains both enemies, mapping, lightning, etc
[*] Is a cool, small, fast and easy level, for just a little extra juice in Half-Life 2 content
[*] We get to see how technology evolved and what was new with the Source engine
[*] We experience a timecapsule from 2004 in terms of techonogy breakthroughs in gaming
[*] Still has a boss fight and a ""hidden"" section on the map, in spite of it's shortness
[*] Gaben talks in this game. GABEN!
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*] No history tied to it, though it still has a NPC with dialog to give it a touch
[*] Seriously short and too easy, less than 30 minutes of gameplay and I didn't die in Hard
[*] Has quite a few graphical bugs, which is awkward considering this is a showcase tool...
[/list]

This is not a game. This is a showcase with developer commentary. It's free though, so it's a good thing to play just for one more Half-Life 2 level or to get to know the Source engine a little bit better. I recommend it because it's so short you won't even notice the cons to it and you will come out of it with knowledge.

[b]If mine (And any other) review was helpful and informative, please mark it as helpful.
We should have good reviews in the store page, not jokes. Thank you![/b]"

4412,"Don't buy this! It comes free with Half Life 2. Not sure why they are charging this much for it. Anyway, this is basically a tech demo/bonus level for you to enjoy. The landscape looks great, the level flows well and although it only lasts about 10 min it is worth a replay every now and again. Also if you want you can listen to commentary about the developing process by Gaben. Or you can just go around killing the Combine. Or both."

4430,I found this game in my steam library...
4431,"Hmm. Given you can't get this on it's own, I'm not even sure what the point of a review is. But here goes:

Created to show off the Source Engine's recently added HDR lighting features, Lost Coast is a chapter that originally would have taken place during the coastal section of Half Life 2. It's short, but very pretty, and well designed with a couple of good puzzles and some strategic gun fights.

I'm surprised they haven't just edited it back into Half-Life 2 and made it part of the game..... there are fan patches that do that, but I could never get them to work."
4432,"Interesting tech demo, including developer commentary."
4433,"Originally it should be one of chapters in original Half-Life 2, it's short one mission DLC, not bad."
4434,Gabe speaks to you for 30 minutes

4436,Lord Gaben Voice!! 10/10 GG
4437,"Hmmm, not a real game, it might have beengood years ago, but nowadays, it's crap. It's free so i still recommend it"
4438,"This is a great tech-demo that showcases the Source engine. It only takes about 20 minutes to finish, but it gives you the overall feel of how a Source game looks and plays. This would definitely come in handy for any potential Source developer wanting to see it's capabilities."
4439,Wonderful graphics.
4440,"[b]Half-Life 2: Lost Coast[/b] is a small additional level for the game, playing out in the Half-Life 2 storyline. This release was originally put out as a showcase for developer Valve's HDR Lighting technology, with new gameplay to demonstrate the new effects."

4442, de plictiseala merge
4443,It's aite.
4444,"Uh
Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead

Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed

Now to make it
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.
2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.
3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.
4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed
5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.
6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings."

4446,"Small little additon to Half-Life 2 doesnt hurt as this ""little"" Cut from the main game is excellent for a ""Little"" mess around and truely love the action with the heli. :D

Hint this game is the same price has the half life complete pack and it also comes with half life 2 stay foar away from half life lost coast

4479,About 18 minutes of gameplay and level design that looks like a kid's mod level disgn.  Absolutely nothing special.
4480,"The graphics in this little game are great, but it is just long enough to tease you and then leave you wanting more. It was nice to play, but it is not worth buying, to me. Since it was included in the package that was on sale at the time that I picked it up, it was not a problem for me."
4481,"It is only 10 minutes of gameplay, at most, but I do have to say this probably would've been the best level and scenery in HL2, if it were included in the original game. It certainly is on par with 'Our Benefactors' (which is the best level in HL2, IMO.) The commentary is a welcome addition, and while it is not hugely instructive, it is not meant to be. It is a glorious tech demo, which is playable and enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it, but with the caveat that it is not something you are gonna replay probably ever. Still rad. [ 8 / 10 ]"

At the end of this tech demo, Gabe says (If you have developer commentary turned on) something along the lines off ""This has been an experiment, if you would like to know more about how games are developed, let us know"", basically.
I like this idea alot. Also if you're like me and you know very little about how graphics are created and their various effects, it's a nice little learning process.
Nice addition to come free with HL2 and a great effort on Valve's part."
4506,"Edit: At the time I didn't know that this is not a game. Had I known more about gaming and such I would've read the info and knew about what this product really was: a showcase. Thus my review is not appropriate. However I didn't enjoy it so my thumb still stays down.

 Awfully short. If you are going to play this game, please note that this is more like a test game. Only one very short chapter and the whole game is done.

 -) Awfully short.
 -) Has a severe problem from Half-Life 1: Downhill footing- Failed to optimize geographical elements.
 -) Unnecessary time hold for next trigger.
 -) Unnecessary riddle for mapping."
4507,Short and sweet and.........free. Recommended.

4509,"""Totally the best demo ever."" 8/10

Can't get enough of that sweet 'Half Life' action? Yeah, I understand. With everyone patiently awaiting the arrival of the highly sought after 'Half Life 3', some of us are forced to take more drastic measures in getting our 'Half Life' fix. We're forced to replay the original 'Half Life' games, yep all three of them, even 'Opposing Force'. We're forced to replay 'Half Life 2', yep every episode, and eventually, when there's nothing 'Half Life' related left to play, we must play through this early tech demo of a removed section of 'Half Life 2' redesigned to showcase Valve's HDR lighting.

But in all seriousness, 'Lost Coast' is a twenty minute demo where you basically walk around admiring the world's surroundings. And when I say admiring, I mean admiring. Seriously, I must have taken in the scenery for over an hour while walking through this demo. And I especially loved the area with the staircase where you get to see Valve's fancy new lighting software and how it mimics what the eye sees in real life. It really is quite impressive, and still is, seeing as how I played through this demo in 2015; 10 years after it's initial release.

You also get the chance to fight some bad guys, solve a very simplistic puzzle that honestly took me way too long to solve, and shoot down a black helicopter (yep, those black helicopters) with a rocket launcher. The real reason however to play through this demo is to get a chance to hear from the developers themselves with the added in commentary. Aside from that it's pretty much everything you'd expect to see while playing 'Half Life 2'."
4510,textures
4511,"Short game, more like a tech-demo of the original Source engine.  Nothing to see here, move along, unless you must have this in your collection of Half-Life games."
4512,"Short game, so buy it in a bundle or something."
4513,"It was okay for the 25 minutes i played it, but after that it was done. So no i do not recommend this game because, it is too expensive for the price for such a short game"
4514,"This was a great and interesting way to display the new functions of the Source Engine. I really hope that future vesions of Valve games are built onto this bacause the lighting is spectacular :)

10/10"
4515,i enjoying using the benchmark until it got cpu limited with ridiculous amounts of AA
4516,7.8/10 too much water
4517,RIP OFF BUT GOOD
4518,"That was short as hell, but hey it did explain some things

And that church was so Goddamn beautiful

I recommend it for the atmosphere"
4519,"it is very short
"
4520,"this is a great video card testing app, IMO"
4521,"I personally got confused in the game but enjoyed all the puzzles in the previous HL 2 along with the original half lifes but found lost coast very interesting especially the developers commentary. but honestly all the half life 2 games were made in either 2004, 2008, or 2010 (i think) but honestly for a game behind present games times it had pretty good graphics and good gameplay and just to think that lost coast shows this ""High dynamic lighting"" to the source engine, honestly Valve can achieve alot of games with this, but one problem is... WHEN IS HALF LIFE 3 COMMMIIINNNNGGGGGG 
Valve, the company that cant count to 3"
4522,Gaben. 10/10
4523,det är ok men det skulle va (mycet) längre lvl eller fler lvlar.
4524,WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? 1 HOUR OF GAME PLAY? REALLY? DONT EVEN BOTHER.
4525,"I recommend that you play this with Commentary Mode on to get the full experience, as this game is more of a learning experience than anything else."
4526,great game
4527,"Gaben speaks.


10/10"
4528,"10 out of 10, Better than any other Half-Life game I have ever seen.

(Do not trust my other Half-Life review)"
4529,"A game from 2004. Play it with commentary on and it will tell you about all the graphical, and physics technology they created that can be seen in games 10 years on. They really need to create Half Life 3 so we can get some new graphical/physics engines."
4530,"It's pretty short, but fun."
4531,The gameplay was really nice and very impressive graphics too :) 10/10 gaben's email lmao
4532,"Awesome tech demo. Only a 10-20 minute play, unless you like to take your sweet time and look at every thing, like myself."
4533,Lightning is amazing!
4534,"Great little demo game, one map, to show off the power the Source Engine had in 2005, and on today's computers, it still looks amazing. One of the main things this game shows off is HDR, or High Dynamic Range, which mimics your eye's pupil in response to differing levels of light. Give it a try!"
4535,"its a nice and small plot,but the gameplay was literally 15-20mins.buy it with a package.buying it alone is a total ripoff"
4536,A tech demo that you have to pay for.
4537,"Show cases some cutting edge graphics from around ten years ago...it was really cool at the time. 

All it really does now is remind how long we've waited for Half LIfe 2: Episode 3 (or just Half Life 3). 

Wishing they would  just end the series or just tell us it's never coming...not cool."
4538,"a ten minute long game... not worth 20 or 30 bucks 
probably a dev game to half life 2 ep 1 or 2 
idk its weird
OTHERWISE 

it is a very good game   much like all other hl"
4539,Buy it.
4540,"Not worth buying, has hardly any content"
4541,"Nice way to show of HDR, but the thing I dont think is so good is the fact that this is a bit overpriced for what it is. I still do recommend this tho. ;)"
4542,I've had this for a long time and I never knew it was a technology showcase. But I played it a lot it was fun good game 10/10
4543,"Oh God, how did i spend 8 hours playing a tech demo?

They promised us so much during the early access pre-alpha 40 years ago, yet I still barely see any progress. This isn't the immersive open-world survival I have been waiting for, but still totally worth 8 hours of your time.  

60$ well spent"
4544,"Never Played.....
10/10 would get free again"
4545,a present from gabenewell becuase HEY! dont think when buying source games your going to get a key for a case
4546,I like guns.
4547,This one's just an interactive benchmark.
4548,if you can get it for free or cheap 8/8 worth listening to the comentary.
4549,"It's a very short game, only about 25 or so minutes long, and that's if you bother to listen to the audio commentary that was included with the game. It's pretty interesting, it gives you insight into how Valve makes their games. At the end of the day, it's more Half-Life 2 to play, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. As a result, I'd recommend you try it."
4550,It's a tech demo.
4551,well you get to shoot some people for a whole of 5 minutes..........
4552,Valve made an entire miniature game level for a graphics stress test.
4553,This [Demo] level is striking! For its time. Fans they must have after seeing.
4554,"A nice short half life episode, easily completed even on hard but still fun."
4555,"Fun & Quick

tech demo/10"
4556,meh
4557,i did this seriously in 18 mins wouldn't buy this
4558,"Essentially it's just a short tech demo with some commentary. You can get it bundled with almost any other Source game (made by Valve), and the level isn't too bad, so there's really no reason to complain."
4559,"It ain't worth 20$,it's just a demo."
4560,how much is this ? i think its 40 dollers but FOR 14 MINTETS OF GAMEPLAY
4561,"A pretty good demo that shows HDR off very well, you get it with hl2 anyway so don't know why it's listed as £27."
4562,"10/10
Revolutionary
long story
intense graphics
a deep and personal motive
excellent voice acting

would play again.
buy today"
4563,"Thumbs up for pretty graphics holding up still today.
Rediculous price for 20 minutes of gameplay though.

I got it in the valve pack when it costed only 24.99 two weeks ago so I'm not one to complain.
Pretty cool though"
4564,Remember this is like a demo. There isn't really much game play here. But please support Valve with the moneys. They might just make us something special for us one day...
4565,its not great
4566,iz gud
4567,"Developers must be troling.
$19 for a 15 minute demo?
$19 for this when whole game bundle costs less?

WTF?!

I got this for free when bought HL2 bundle. I feel sorry for people who had payed for this."
4568,A rare glimpse behind the curtain.
4569,god game
4570,Good DLC part!
4571,"Just a little tech demo, with some commentary from the great Valve team, it was worth it just to hear Gabe Newell's voice.
"
4572,"Well, I honestly got lost while playing Lost Coast. So atleast I wasn't lied to."
4573,Half-Life 2: Lost Coast. It's almost like a game demo. But this one is different than the actual HL2 demo. It's a map seperated from the rest of the full game.
4574,A demo showing off what the Source engine is capable of. Has a nice developer commentary mode that is fun to listen to.
4575,"A fun little ditty with some nerdy tech commentary. That commentary kind of makes it worthwhile to play through it once. The level is nice and the graphics are nice, but don't pay for this. Just check it out if you get it in a bundle."
4576,"I had been downloading this game longer than I played it. About 10 minutes to gameplay. I am disappointed.

Graphics: 7/10
Gameplay: 5/10
"
4577,"Not for gameplay, more for graphics. It's a tech demo, kinda. Normally wouldn't recommend, but Valve."
4578,Amazing even today!
4579,Dont know how but ive spent 8 hours here and its clearly 10/10
4580,"Very short game. It's more of a demo. 
Still good, but like 20 min. of content."
4581,"it's a nice littel addon to half life 2, but not worth the $20 listed price if bought alone for 10-20 min worth of game play.depending on how fast you can run this tiny chapter

graphics are decent
game play is good
sory is short as hell whole game can prolly be ran in 7-10 if you already know exactly what to do. 

basics
shoot your way up a mountain side/ cliff. go into a building open the missle silo toss something in it kill a few more run out shoot a helicopter down with rockets walk scafling to elivator cart get into elivator cart. ride it back down to beginning and done.

if you can find this maybe for $1 or get it in a bundle then sure. but i would by no means pay $20 as a solo buy."
4582,Hi. I just posted this review to make this game seem more popular.
4583,"This ""game"" is a benchmarking demo that Valve made after improvements in the Source Engine following Half Life 2. This should be priced at a constant $5 so it's quite the rip off. 

I'm not sure but it could be automatically added to your library when you purchase Half Life 2."
4584,NIceeeeeeee
4585,"E-mail gaben haha : )
But not actually, he's very busy making Episode 3.
This was a really nice tech demo though, loved the commentary."
4586,"It's honestl just a cut mission, and a good one at that. it is short, but it's just one mission, not a full game. Plus, you get it regardless.
8 / 10"
4587,Nice old man )
4588,"$20 demo

10/10 would buy at full price again

Edit: Bought again"
4589,This was not its own game more like a tech demo takes around 25 minutes to beat.I dont recomend buying it but if you get it with the half life complete or valve complete pack by all means play it its  rather fun
4590,It's just a short half life story. I would like if they added more to the game (longer gameplay) and maybe some chapters (only 1 chapter) but i thought it was fun.
4591,"I nice quick demo, basically.  Was fun to play and to see teh ""new"" features.  Free with the HL or Valve bundles"
4592,"Good tech demo with great developed comments, I don't do or plan to do game development, but it was still very interesting to hear how they made things and what it took to make it."
4593,420/10 you can troll the gullible fisherman into letting you into the city
4594,Goods!!!
4595,"After playing Half-Life 2. I saw I got this also in some free package way. And so I played and liked. It hit me that this is a level to show off graphics and visuals and mechanics. Fancy video game stuff and It took me no time to beat. There is only maybe 2 dozen evil Combine, couple head crabs and a helicopter. That's it, true their all elite Combine, but psh soon you get a sub-machine gun and pulse rifle....DONE and a bonus fun crossbow snipe. A nice level, but nothing really that I didn't see in Half-Life 2."
4596,"nice graphics, but a too short imo

3 grenades and 2 rockets later.. uses gravity gun and a church bench"
4597,Short about 20-30 minutes but a very good-looking tech demo.
4598,"fucking terrible, the piece of shit crown on the cake compossed of ass, okay now that was harsh but i think it needs to be said, half life 2 has major flaws and witout its major praise i would have never bought (wasted my money)  on this game, okay once again too much, but rely maybe it is because of the fact that i have barely played the game but that doesnt mean anything, because if a game is to bad for me to get to the redeming secound half of the game then the ame is bad because i wont see it. also the fact that the game is so widely hailed made the game at incredible status in my mind so being met with first a mediocre game then a plain shit game ment that it looked even worse to me. also as i do i will finish this game so then people wont throw shit at me for not getting to the previously mentioned redeeming secound half."
4599,"Half Life 2 Lost Coast is a fun but very short game, it doesn't really have anything to do with half life story but more of show n tell of the source engine, You get the game for free once you purchuse Half Life 2. All n all my own personal rating for this game would be a 8/10"
4600,"Mostly for modders, It's not worth buying if you are looking for another campain. It's only one map but I find it useful when messing with maps, models, sounds, particles, ect."
4601,"fuck that game man... it sucks... realy... i mean if this shit will be game i'll respect this when it'll be game.. i'ts not so bad... i mean i've bought Half Life 2 last year and this game was gift or kinda like taht... but u better nut to buy this game guys.. 
"
4602,"It's ummmm a demo for the best shooter ever.
So is it good? Uh yeah.
It's HL2 gameplay with a new map & chapter.
...And it includes developer commentary OMG 11/10 would develop commentaries again."
4603,"Start seemed strange but then realized that this is a demo version of the game.
Generally beautiful graphics, quality is also happy.
Waiting 3 parts ..."
4604,The car is my favorite
4605,"Some Random Minge game you get idk how. It's really short and pretty much a waste of time. You get like half an hour of game play so don't even bother. I mean if you get it fore free sure you can play it but i wouldn't bother tbh. But since it's Half Life i have too give it a good rating so Half Life demo, 7/10"
4606,Lost Coast? I'm most certainly lost. Is this a game or a Half Life simulator?
4607,"DAT GRAPHICS :3 
Pretty Sexy Frostbite 3...
I hear VALVE is busy with source engine 2...
Maybe thats the cause of us not having HL3, right?...
Dunno, I see a lot of you complaining you had to buy the pack...
The Half-Life complete pack... lemme tell you guys something amazing...
Something thats ganna make your nipples diamonds, cut through solid walls...
And píss a living crap tone of you off for paying a lot and make your nipples diamods...
You dont have to buy the pack ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), yip u dont have to buy the pack 4 this...
Lol infact all you need to do is... Buy Half-Life 2: EP 1 and boom... theres ur lost coast...

Like this Post for Diamond Nipples..."
4608,"there is a beech and a cliff and gaben
combine/10"
4609,Great little HL map. Wish there was a harder difficulty though.
4610,I like the half life serires and i think this is a fun game.
4611,"Better than hl3,buy now"
4612,"short game. basically like a bonus to half life 2. i think valve just wants to show off the lovely graphics. amazing too, gotta say"
4613,"""there was gaben voice""
10/10"
4614,"Product that has shown what we were going to meet in series: physics, enemies, guns, gameplay and landscape."
4615,"A short but sweet cut level that  was brought back for an HDR tech demo. 
"
4616,"I was ""awed"" by the High Dynamic Range lighting that was added to the Source engine.  This is the best graphics I have ever seen in a game.  So real!  Wish Half-Life 2: Lost Coast could be played a lot longer because the realism was ""so real."""
4617,"The graphics are incredible,but the ""game"" is too short.You can finish in 10-15 minutes."
4618,Impecable jveux dire sa dure 20 minute.....
4619,"This is definitely a good mod for Half-Life 2. Not perfect, but good.
A few problems with scripting here and there, but to be honest: its a one chapter game, so who the hell cares?
9.5/10"
4620,why is this 40 dollars? unless you get this for free i cannot recoment buying it.
4621,you shoot enemy in face and die in this epic game
4622,"This really isn't much of a game, but more of a tech demo for the technical geeks. This little gem includes most elements found in its complete game, Half-Life 2. Originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2, this unused concept was scrapped, possibly due to time constraints or maybe based upon the fact that this game is a prototype all on its own.

This demo details various visual and graphic capabilities that are found in that said complete game. All the while, this ''game'' just shows how immensely strong the Source engine is, considering it was pretty new for its time back in 2004, and how it would become the most essential game engine to date, what with various Valve and 3rd party games being built on top of this incredible engine. The most clear concept that is shown off is the high dynamic range lightning that is now most commonly used in nearly all of Valve's games. 

There isn't much of a story or a narrative in this demo, you're none other than Gordon Freeman, who is stranded on a lost coastal cliff, (The clue is in the title.) that you must climb up to destroy a Combine artillery launcher in a monastery, which is rebelling and attacking a nearby town. Though this is just one massive chunk of a technological demonstration, it has several story elements that didn't make the cut in the final game. As a result, this level received a good response from the community, as if the fans haven't been missing anything at all.

While I would say, this game is very interesting if you love to dig down and unearth various unused game content and maybe discover a little of the history that had been closed."
4623,"No point its a 10 min long shitty section. Why cut out this rubbish then force people to pay for it, FFS Valve. what were you thinking?"
4624,"You stuiped assholes it's just a tech demo.
It DOESN'T cost 40$.

It doesn't have a fucking price!

(It's free)"
4625,"The process is so short, only about 10 minutes. 
There is a saying thst it is released to test how the Source Engine works. On MacBook Pro (late 2013), it may drop some frames when there are more than 5 enemies within the sight if the effects were turned to all high."
4626,"Very sharp graphics and good game play, the challenge factors are also good. This is a very promising game and fun to repeat, even if it's just one level."
4627,nice lighting demo.
4628,Valve has got some balls saying this is a game. More like a showcase of the graphics the game was capable of and some dumb ass commentary.
4629,The best game you never had.
4630,"So good demo
"
4631,"Not really a game in that it's only one area, a few enemies, and minimal character interaction.  Mainly just for showing off the game engine's capabilities."
4632,"Good game if you're interested in the development of Half-life 2

8/10"
4633,This game is awesome so play it or die (jk)
4634,Obviously one of the best FPS games of all time.
4635,"Short, mediocre, playable. Practically a part of a level from Half-Life 2 with slightly better graphics. 8/10"
4636,"I went for a swim and got killed by many electric eels.
10/10"
4637,"Yeah, I've got this game in a bundle, but it's not all that great. I mean, the graphics are pretty cool for a 2005 game but that's about it. So for the love of God PLEASE don't buy this game for it's full price of 40 bucks."

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is an incredible, high quality game, that will make you want to shed some tears. I highly recommend you playing this game, however if you do play this game, you will need a box of tissues, because once you hear the voice of our lord and saviour, lord GabeN you will cry.

4641,"Best game ever, I loved the part where you talk to the fisherman. You become so attached to him, its hard to let this game go. 
12/10"
4642,"I am sure we all had this game stored away as part of a package deal. *Talking about Orange box* 
I much like others wanted to get into playing Half Life 2 for the first time and see if the youtube videos and fan made creation truly gave the game credit. I eagerly placed Lost Coast aside unaware of the intended purpose. So there it sat in the library collecting dust until I decided to sit down on a cold October day with coffee and play something to waste a few mins. 

So to start this off, This is NOT a game. (No seriously, if you were thinking of along the lines as a full game. You are wrong.) like other reviews stated this is simply to show off the graphics of the world using the engine. Even I got to admit I liked the setting and the atmosphere was very easy to get pulled into without realizing it was a fall day outside your window. 

Okay, all good things aside the only real thing I wished was possible was the ability to go further into details by checking out the city/town/village, I would of really enjoyed exploring but overall not too disappointed. So if you have a small bit of time to kill and don't have any problem with exploring a place while shooting combine on the side, a nice enjoyment here."
4643,Pretty much pointless addition to our Steam library. It is just one mission that showed a new graphics feature for that time. Less than 30 mins of play. Leaves you wanting more and wondering why is this featured as a separate game.
4644,You'd have more fun playing the game than this demo.
4645,JUST A QUICK 20 MINUTES OF RUN AND SHOOT WITH NO CONTENT.
4646,i liked the fisherman
4647,I beat this extreamly quickly but its still worth a play if you got it in one of the bundles it a good very small amount of half life 2 that has pretty cool battle parts so give it a quick play
4648,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast came bundled with Counter-Strike: Source. It's not worth buying this game seperately because it only has about an hour worth of gameplay, but it's worth 1 hour of your time if you get it in a bundle."
4649,"A short tech demo with deleted content from Half-Life 2. It's free so you may consider checking it out but there is not much to it. You should beat it in one sitting, hopefully."
4650,40$ for 15 minute gameplay is too expensive
4651,Well- Oh its over?
4652,"Short mission, very pretty map."
4653,"First of all, I love every single half-life game that was ever made, except this one. The only reason why I'm giving this a bad review is because it costs $40 fucking dollars for a simple tech demo! You can beat this in about 15 minutes but all this is that valve is just simply showing off some new tech they got their hands on, that is it. There is no story, and from what I have heard this is one of the most un-touched games in steam. You can get it if you like, but you also get it for free if you buy half-life 2 episode one (Or one of the half-life games). So do not get this unless you want to just sit there listening to the programers jabber on and on about how minor things wil improve the game by a lot."
4654,"Recommended, as [i]part[/i] of a Half Life / Valve package"
4655,"The best game that the computer 
Need to make Half-Life 3 
The game never boring and always fun to play 
Best game of all-time"
4656,"Pretty much no gameplay, only useful as a tech demo. Got it at a sale, but would not pay 37 euros for it."
4657,"the graphics in this game are the best I have ever seen. It is beautiful in every way and if its graphics were combined with a good story it would be extremely immersive. It made me feel like I was the character. The weapon draw time is perfect and it looks as if youre actually taking a gun out from its sling. The gun mechanics are perfected without a flaw, when you are either shooting or reloading, its movement and sound are as convincing as a real gun. And the lighting and reflection make it seem as if it were real life. I would not recommend spending the $40 as its more of a demomstration and explanation of HDR rather than a story. But if its on sale i would highly recommend purchasing it because it will be very enjoyable and will definetely spark a conversation."
4658,Not much to do here...but it looks awesome and plays better...nuff said!
4659,"For a test game,it's pretty good!
Now,excuse me and let me list the reasons why it's good.
- Speedrunning is easy
- Good graphics
- Nice and addicting gameplay
- it's a half-life game.(Where can you go wrong?)
- It's a good time waster
- EVERYTHING
"
4660,"[b]PROS:[/b]
+ Gabe's voice
+ interesting view on game development
+ view into the Half Life 2 engine mechanics

[b]CONS:[/b]
- not really a game
- just a graphic demo with a bit of shooting

[b]Comment:[/b]
I am really not sure if I should recommend this or not. It's not particularly bad but in reality this is just a demo, one small map with some commentary from the developers. Some enemies can be found but not that many. So while the idea to show us how Valve does their games this is just a showcase for hardcore fans of Valve/Half Life. But since this comes in a bundle and is extra stuff packaged with other games I will give it the thumb pointing upwards...

4661,For all intents and purposes this is half life 3
4662,"It's just a level that shows you some aspects of the source engine and how games are developed at valve. Nice tour. Now, speaking seriously...

20/10 Gabe Newell's voice simulator. Heard: ""Buy <game on sale that you want on steam> right now, you know you want to"" everytime I saw his name on the audio log."
4663,"In this game, Gabe Newell talks to you. You must listen to what that man has to say."
4664,"Valve is the only company I know that can make a short tech demo FUN. It has the same great gameplay we've come to expect from the Half-Life series.

And even though this game's technology is outdated by today's standards, it's still cool to see just how far Valve has come from debuting with a game made on a heavily modified version of the Quake engine."
4665,37 dollars for this... 6/10
4666,"Nothing great here, maybe only for HL junkies. Started playing it and couldn't keep myself playing the game. Too slow paced, combat only average. The story telling seems to be the strong point of these games, the rest is highly forgettable."
4667,"Just a showcase.
Developer commentary in place if you want to listen the employees of Valve speak about how they made the one level and some other stuff about new mechanics. 
Other than that, it's a nice little gameplay."
4668,I got this when Valve Complete Pack for 17.99 euro soo i liked it but story was too short !!! Valve shame on you !!! Still good game tho!
4669,It shows all of what they were going to add ( But didn't ).
4670,It's almost like I'm playing Half-Life 3. ^_^
4671,good
4672,i beat it in 30 minutes its just a tech demo
4673,wow one chapter.... NOPE!!!!
4674,"The gametime for Lost Coast can be completed in about 30 minutes, maybe even 20 if you know what you are doing. The price of the game is free as it comes with HL2, which is nice. It's a good technical showpiece, and you can stare at all the beautiful scenary and all the touches...considering it's on the Source engine, which at the time, is definitely a stunning thing. Not a lot to see or do though, as it's really just a single mission. You go from the bottom of a cliff to the top, fight off some enemies and a heli, and bam...you're finished. Game over, good job. I founds I never ran out of ammo or health, plentiful for such a small amount of people to shoot at.

As a technical showpiece, it's a solid 8/10. Though I wished it could've been a bit longer, and well, harder in difficulty."
4675,"[h1]An interesting commentary game but nothing special.

5/10[/h1]"
4676,"20 mins tech demo of the Source engine. Includes commentary from various Valve employees, including our Lord and Savior Gabe Newell."
4677,"You meet a fisherman for no reason then murder a bunch of people with a crowbar in this action packed short.

4678,Too short
4679,wtf dude. you have to pay this shit for 10 minutes gameplay? for fuck's sake
4680,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is an amazing game , its a short game to show the dynamic feature of the source engine .
Its not only short but great , fast and you need to use your brain sometime.
But mainly this game is the most unplayed game on steam , i was like whaaat ? are you serious , ok i  accept the fact that its a short game and you need half life complete to get it no other way, but still who dont like half life ? Everyone love it so please install the game beacuse i know you have the game in you library its only 400 mb thats nothing :) 
I hope you enjoy my review , i  enjoyed the game even only for 0.2 hours 
 
Pros:
-Story
-Fisherman
-Boss Battle 
-All weapons
- its half life duuh

Cons: 
-You need Half Life Complete to play it grab it now its only 9,24 euro 
- Too much ennemy and i would like to admire the little village"
4681,"Cool, it's cool..."
4682,Extremely cool !
4683,"It's Valve's Way of showing off...

Comes free with ""Half Life 2""
Just buy Half Life 2 and enjoy the damn game."
4684,£25 for a 15 mins game....... RIP-OFF

4691,I LOVE IT!!!
4692,"Solid but short DLC for HL 2...

4693,Clearly the best of the Half Life series. a must purchase 10/10.
4694,i enjoyed the level. make more half life!
4695,cool
4696,"I got stuck, wow. 1000000000000/10

4697,"a sub version of an old school valve game
its ok - ign"
4698,"This is just one of those short demo games where you play once, enjoy the commentary if you are into game designing then put away forever. Not really a waste of time because there is some interesting content."
4699,Still longer than Metal Gear 5
4700,From what i read some people say theres a story others say that it really is just a graphics show case i belive they say story cuase of the hl2 eps I really hope you will update this instead of just having it be a show case.
4701,"This $40 game is well worth the money, the lighting and presentation was flawless. The game and plot seemed to flow very fluidly and well. The duration of the game is a little on the short side but the gameplay was fantastic. The way your thrown into the story with no background information makes this plot seem real or authentic.

Best game of 2005"
4702,eh?
4703,100% Recommended
4704,its good but why so much money??
4705,"10 minutes long, still better then CoD"
4706,"And you thought Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes was overpriced...

Its summer, sales are going on. Half-Life series goes on a flash sale. I buy Half-Life 2 and both episodes for a total of around siz bucks. I go to my library to see something odd. Three other games I have no record of purchasing.

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is more of a sightseeing tour than an actual Half-Life game. The game is supposed to take place sometime during the ""Highway 17"" chapter of Half-Life 2, but it really dosnt fit in.

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast introduces nothing new to the series, exept a heavily modified Source Engine. The water is more reflective and Gordon's pupils ajust to lighting. Thats it.

The game looks more like Counter-Strike: Source that Half-Life 2.

Standalone, you pay $50 for a 10 minute experience. Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is $30 for the main 2 hour mission, plus side missions. Half-Life 2: Lost Coast has one mission, and one mission only. Do NOT buy this as a stand-alone game. Buy Half-Life 2 and both episodes (if you havnt already) and you will get this for free. You will also get Half-Life Deathmatch: Source and Half-Life 2 Deathmatch. Three free games for the price of one and two expantions? Thats a good deal.

Half-Life 2:Lost Coast isnt a bad game, its just unfairly priced. If anything, it should be free.

2/10"
4707,"It's okay, I guess. I expected it to be a bit longer, but it's interesting to say the least."
4708,"While Lost Coast has become a sort of joke among fans, i personally enjoyed it for what it is, a Tech Demo.

Lost Coast is simply a demo of VALVe's new technology, while also showcasing some interesting mechanics. The commentary is great throughout, providing interesting insight into the game developing process, as well as HDR.

It'll only take you about 15-20 minutes to complete if you take the time to listen to commentary and admire the surroundings, and nothing is particularly difficult, but it does show some fun gameplay with combine soldiers on a cliffside.

All in all, if you bought Half-Life complete and are wondering if you want to play this, go ahead and do it! This is a fun little tech demo with pretty graphics."
4709,The fisherman is perhaps the most flushed out and realistic character ever to be put in a video game he is filled with so much depth and humour the lost coast is a one in a lifetime release and a must play for all you shiny rock enthusiasts an easy 10/10
4710,"You want me to review this?

Theres a fisherman and he asks you to do some stuff about the combine.

It's entirely not canon to the story and is just a show off for the Engine."
4711,6.9/10. Buggy poece of SHIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT.
4712,Half-Life 2 Lost Coast is a short Action Game where you have to stop the combines from destroying the Lost Coast. Short but fun.
4713,"Best 10 minutes of my life 
10/10
GOTY"
4714,A nice expansion to half life 2
4715,This game is the best.
4716,"I laughed, I cried. Half-Life 2: Lost Coast taught me how to love again."
4717,"I'm seeing this for forty dollars. Is it actually worth that? 
I recieved it as a gift, and thought it nice, but it's not really a game worth forty dollars at all. it's a 40 minute to one-hour game that's mostly about director commentary. It's not commentary on the half life game though, it's one short level aside from the HL2 storyline, without any kind of story. It's neat, definitely, but i wouldn't spend more than $5 on it."
4718,"This game is really short, but is still very enjoyable. I recommend that you install it with HL2, 'cause then you'll get it for free."
4719,Lost coast is a cut level from half-life 2 and it will take you about 15-20 mins depending on your skill in half-life games. It takes place during the highway 17 chapter and only has one Friendly NPC called the fisherman voiced by the same guy who voiced bill from Left 4 dead and Father Gigori from the ravenholm chapter of half-life 2. Overall I would rate this a 7/10
4720,"This took me 5 minutes to complete. 3/10, yet I still sorta feel like reccomending it."
4721,For $40 this game is WAYYY TO SHORT! But Its a must have for hardcore gamers like me who like a good challenge. just buy the valve complete bundle and you'll be satisfied.
4722,This was a fun game to play.
4723,Short and sweet
4724,"I have logged over 2000 hours playing this game, Im rad."
4725,Here is my only issue any of the glowlight products do not work with any of the valve games correctly. to shoot it's to push left on the right joystick.
4726,10/shrek - ign it's like skyrim with guns.
4727,"I would recommend this game if you would like to see some neat graphics, but if your looking for a long story, then sorry. It IS a pretty entertaining game, and I wish it was part of Half Life 2 like it was planned to be, but still. like i said, entertaining."
4728,The negative review is not related to this level itself - it's the fact that I have no idea why this was not incorporated into the final game in some way despite there being ideas of where it would go and how Gordon would wind up here. It's a fantastic mission that would have made a decent sequel even better.
4729,"A good diversion and it works perfectly as a tech demo to show off how beautiful the source engine can be 12 years later.
I loved the developer commentary, it's interesting learning about the processes that go into creating the water effects and the little details that make Half Life what it is.
"
4730,"[i]Half-Life 2: Lost Coast[/i] is some kind of show-case made by Valve to introduce their new High Dynamic Range method of applying light inside the Source Engine. Actually, although this is a very technical subject, the developer's commentary that comes with it, is more than worthwhile listening to. It gives quite some insight into how this mini-level was constructed, and even into how HDR lighting actually works. It's not easy to talk about something as complex as this is an easily understandable manner. Fascinating stuff, and for the die-hard Vavle-fans: you even get Gabe Newell's words at the beginning of the commentary ;-).

After playing it through for a second time recently - after having left it aside for over five years -  I felt amazed by how lively most of the graphics and - of course - the lighting still look today - a full nine (!!!) years after this level was published. Especially the little Byzantine church, part of the monastery on top of the cliffs, still feels amazing and oozes atmosphere. Valve did a wonderful job with the lighting inside the church, even letting dimmed light through the stained-glass windows. At the same time, it also made me a bit sad, because, well, how long has it been since we got the latest Half-Life content? Oh well, who knows....

Since this one comes for free in the [i]Orange Box[/i] and the Half Life 2-complete package, I guess most of you who played [i]Half-Life 2[/i] at some point, have this in your game collection. If you haven't tried it yet, by all means do so, but be advised: it's very good, but also very short ;-).

Overall rating: 8/10"
4731,"This also contains the full vanilla HL2 campaign for those who are unaware. Simply open the console and type in maps * to see

edit: this is not an april fools joke"
4732,"This is not necessarily a game as much as an opportunity to make some fun mods or explore.  This is long overdue as this ""game"" (demo if you ask me) has been out forever!  The graphics are actually pretty good for something that has been out for so long.  That being said, I suggest you use this to test your graphics card as opposed to actually expecting a game.  I would rate it a mislabeled product out of 10.  Enjoy."
4733,"Don't get why this is so expensive, Since it's a single map."
4734,It's just a tech demo
4735,From learning about HDR technology to jamming a gun with a chair you will enjoy this technical demo again and again.

4742,fisherman is cool
4743,Very classic game. love it.
4744,This is really sort of a short game and it follows along the Half-Life universe. Not a bad game at all. Nice!

4746,The least played game on steam isn't that bad

4748,Good Game 10/10
4749,sdfsdfsdfsdfsdfsdf ITS GOOD :D
4750,A delightfully short little hardware/software test with just enough gameplay to be satisfactory without overshadowing its parent game.  Recommended to people who loved HL2 and want to learn about how they made it possible via the new Developer Commentary mode.
4751,"It may not be what you would really consider a game.

But its still fun to play and kill Combine and mess around and learn about HDR At the same time.

6.8/10."
4752,Longer and better storyline then COD
4753,"Short. Interesting, but short."
4754,simply best game ever made 30/10
4755,"A really cool little Half-Life 2 scenario. It'll only take a few minutes to complete, but is action packed and of the same high quality as Half-Life 2. Definately worth playing."
4756,"The most unplayed free DLC on Steam, a level that didn't make it into the final cut of 'Half Life 2', is well worth playing, another excellent setting (a church above a cliff) that looks great for an excellent game."
4757,"EDIT: 2014 me was a dumbass, please take this review with a container full of salt

the game is just a graphics tours on hdr.

it comes with HL2

its LAGGS on my laptop

but you know what?
meh.

4761,It was ok
4762,"This is the absolute greatest game ever made. It is a brilliant expansion to the critically acclaimed Half-Life 2, and adds bucket-loads of exclusive new content: New character, an intriguing plot, improved graphics, and a guest appearence by Gabe Newell himself. It is truely a masterpeice. 10/10 You've done it again Valve."
4763,"why the heck do they make it so expencive i wasted 40 dollars on this.....you only get 10 min of play time.....its gay they need to lower the price...DONT GET THE GAME GO BUY SOMETHING ELSE

4764,"although very short, i enjoyed the mini-mission this dlc offered. the commentary of how Valve thought about level design was very interesting, i highly suggest playing with commentary and also enjoy this mini-mission!"
4765,Fun
4766,Pretty much sandbox Items for GarrysMod.
4767,"This is 30 bucks for something this short, id like it if it was 5 bucks."

4775,"Well... lets see... Hmm... let's think really hard. What are the good things about Half Life 2: Lost Coast? Well... I don't have any idea. It's as simple as that. Nothing.
                                          --------

Ask yourself this. Would you buy a game where you get stuck on a stupid little part about 11 minutes into the game where a bridge always breaks after a combine breaks it? No. Exactly. That is why it comes free with Half Life 2. There's no point in those people on forums that say ""Bwagghhh I bought HL2 So i could get lost coast troloolo lawlz"", it doesn't make any sense. Wait, woah woah, you've never heard of those people? Exactly, there is no people like that. Please, do not waste your time on lost coast. Play HL2 and have fun."
4776,Tech Demo is beautiful and the commentary is amazing. Even for 2005. Keep in mind this tech demo comes with the game! It doesnt cost 40 dollars
4777,"I know it's great and people say it's too short well it kinda is but its a demo a tech demo its just like the hl2 one a that will continue also,they expland it to you like the brightness from being inside a building then when you walk out its like real life everythings a bit brighter they probaly worked hard on that(this might be in hl3 if it even comes out)"
4778,"Great game, highly recommended!"
4779,"Heyyo, back when High Dynamic Range shader technique was ""the new thing"" in graphics fidelity? Lost Coast was a really fancy tech demo."
4780,"good dev comments, must listen for everyone (also in e1-2 & Portal 1-2)"
4781,short game and over priced but yet a good part of half life
4782,FUCKIN BUBBLES
4783,is the coast lost in another world?
4784,people tha buys half life 2 episode pack haves half life 2 lost coast free
4785,I really liked the vista of this game. Somewhat cliffy mediterranean kind of view. Nice idea to show new technologies using this release.
4786,The birth of GabeN
4787,"K, so let me lay this down: This is a demo for the HDR lighting that the Source engine is capable of. A demo itself is not 40 dollars, it is included in a bundle (also I beleive if you get Half-Life 2 you get this as well). Should you purchase said bundle? Yes. The games have become some of my favorite of all time. Should you play THIS game? Eh, go ahead. It's a good time-waster, taking only a few minutes to complete. So now it's up to you. Haven't played Half-Life before? Purchase Half-Life Complete package. Everything you need is there."
4788,"Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrrPMFVUuRE"
4789,This is awesome. It shows all the features of the source engine and how awesome it is. 10/10
4790,A very enjoyable add-on to the original game. I highly recommend turning on the developer commentary; it's quite interesting and informative.
4791,"This games was like seeing a blob in front of a real lighthouse, or reading a book about a lighthouse, with the lights off."
4792,theres not that much to this FPS short singleplayer. but this game was action but short
4793,"*DISCLAIMER!* This game is not 39 bucks like many think, its free when you get HL2 lets just get that out of the way.

Half Life 2: Lost Coast is a deleted level from Half Life 2, if you wanted to be more specific its somewhere during the ""car level."" For you completionists never fear! for this game is somewhat non-cannon as its main Purpose is to be a TECH DEMO! so don't worry about where it exactly fits in.

Thats right, this is a Free demo when you purchase Half Life 2 ( I got mine in the Half Life Bundle.) Lost Coast shows off the slightly upgraded Source Engine that almost all Valve Titles run on, mainly the lighting (Not going to bore you with the details as that would ""spoil the commentary."")

This is also the first appearance of Valve's developer commentary that is now a regular staple in their games. Unless you are really into the development part of Half Life you might not be interested in that side that Lost Coast has to offer.

*GAMEPLAY* 
Like I said this is a deleted level from HL2 so don't expect a full game on this one. You meet a fisherman, take on a few baddies, blow up a gunship and look at the nice graphics. No achievements, no gnome, no real challenge. But hey its worth it to give it a go one time and then forget about it in your steam library. 

*OVERALL*
This is a tech demo not a game, its more or less a show and tell for Valve's hard work on the Source Engine's improved lighting. I would have loved to see this in the full game but alas no such luck, perhaps in HL3? it takes no time at all to play and has our favorite Crowbar loving scientist. 

Rise and shine Mr. Freeman, rise and shine to play HL2: Lost Coast!"
4794,"A short level showcasing the HDR rendering and developer commentary in Source engine, set near a small town called St. Olga. The town was originally slated to take place somewhere between the Highway 17 and Sandtraps chapters, but was dropped."
4795,"This comes free with Half-Life 2, and what it is is that it's basically a demo for half life 2 that shows you what all the source engine can do. I've beaten the whole thing ~4 times (because it only lasts like 20 minutes) but every time I play it I notice something new. Only something like 30% of poeple with half life 2 have tried it, but i think it's at least worth a shot."
4796," For One This is not a Game Meant for Story Or Gameplay But Shows you how steam is able to use Next Gen Graphics And Proccessing Such as Lighting, Modeling And Textures

 This adds A Very Small amount of challenge but really is cool about how valve can Do things such as a Cliff Arena Where Enemies can be Infront, Under Or even Above You

 This ""Game"" Just takes about maybe atleast 40-80 Minutes
To complete If you Listen to The Audio Logs

 I give this a 4 Star Rating Due to it Being really cool But at the same time your paying more then you get, BUT REMEMBER! All the money Helps Valve"
4797,its stuipid i already had it ONE! chapter nothing else last about 10 mins at most probly was 4 $ or 3 $ now its 40.00$!
4798,I don't know what to say. It has a 10-15 minute long gameplay.
4799,"Fun little level. It's Intersting to see the technology used to the fullest and to hear the developer commentary, just keep in mind this single level is very VERY short and adds nearly nothing to the HL2 lore."
4800,its like 2o mins long ?!?
4801,"Shows what the engine can do.

Tips: Play with commentary
Pretty good I guess."

4803,"It's a half baked dlc, informitave, but a half baked dlc, nothing more."
4804,this game made me cry

"
4806,"Filled with everyone's favorites: HDR and Bloom. Now all we need are some lens flares and we're good to go.

8/10"
4807,This demo is better than any call of duty game 10/10
4808,"when i dont recommend this ""game"", i mean not to play it. it comes with half life 2. anyway, this incredibly short free DLC for Half Life 2 takes place on a mysterious island, a ""Lost Coast"". from what i can tell Gordon was unconciouss in the actual, much better full game. then, some fisherman comes up and says ""Hi youre a doctor i bet youre here to kill the combine."", then you go up a mountain, shooting Combine on the way, until you get to a small village, then you go into a church, where you destroy a big gun (which was the point of the whole thing) with the gravity gun, then you kill some headcrabs, then some more combine, then you go out another way to kill more combine, then you fight a helicopter, then you go down a swingy lift (arguably the funnest bit in this DLC), then he says ""Well done we'll have a feast to celebrate, i hope you like Leeches"", then he says shit about you being fuzzy around the edges, it fades into black and he says ""Bye"", and so do i to this DLC, because that was literally the whole thing described. one paragraph. now you know what happens and you dont need to play this. you're welcome."
4809,"boring as hell, you get about 5 mins gameplay then it's all over! even if you manage to make it to the town by hugging the coast tou'll find half rendered buildings and nothing else it's not worth a penny!"
4810,"good but short, i don't really get what's the point of this?"
4811,"Simple good chapter, but very expensive."
4812,"16 minutes of killing things.
10/10"
4813,It's pretty much a little part of Half Life 2 that got cut out of the final game and made into a little tech demo for HDR. It's pretty neat and there are many ways you can get this for free
4814,An awesome 20-30 minutes of Half Life.
4815,Only down because this was just a promo for new graphics components in their games.
4816,never played and never will.
4817,Great if you just want another taste of the Half Life world before HL3 and you get to hear the developers gloat a bit about how they made the game. More of a filler than anything but still fun to play.
4818,A really good game with a really interesting story. I recommend this game a lot. Also the graphics are awesome.
4819,It has a shitty plot line and extremely short gameplay its not worth any of youre money for 40 dollars!! -0/10
4820,Its basically a 15 minute demo wow.
4821,"This is obviously quite excellent, because it's a...well, I guess by modern Steam standards it might be called an official Half-Life 2 ""DLC"", though ""standalone playable technology showcase"" also seems to cover it quite well.  

   It's not a game in itself, it's a brief but enjoyable scenario/side-quest set in the Half-Life universe. Made by Valve. So obviously excellent, but I wouldn't exactly go buying a $40 pack for this and this alone if you already own all or most of the other stuff in it. But if you got Lost Coast for free, as I believe I did, then there's truly nothing to complain about, is there?  

   On the other hand, if you're the ""independently wealthy"" type, $40 might be the equivalent of a piece of chewing gum in the back pocket of us lesser plebs, so you may as well just spend that much on a 30-minute ""game"" irrespective. Or you could be more generous and give it to the derelict currently rifling through the trash can on your footpath, if you're that filthy stinkin' rich.  

   OH LORD HELP ME, WHY AM I EVEN BOTHERING TO WRITE THESE WORDS? I think I may have an addiction to game reviewing, this is my second one tonight...

Verdict: 9/10 (as long as you didn't pay anything for it)."
4822,"I geniunly enjoyed this game, its the sort of game you play on a rainy saturday! this game had a fun story and the dev commentary was amazing, the game should cost anything due to its length of just 10mins but yeah i loved it"
4823,"Liked it! I don't see why Valve didn't include this part in the canon, but still... Play it, especially if you can't wait for HL3!"
4824,"I don't see any reasons why it costs so much, since you've got only directors commentaries about their new performances in the engine and then a 5-minute gameplay. I got it from the sale, so it doesn't hurt that much, but still. I don't see any point of having it this expensive. I expected more from it, but still, at least those informations were there. 7/10"
4825,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a one mission episode of about 30 minutes where game developers give you comments in-game about the scenarios of Half-Life 2. The game itself cannot be purchased alone and is included in Half-Life 2 bundles. If you like behind the scenes clips, you will found interesting to hear how the game was developed and how they included HDR and some other aspects in the final game."
4826,"To all the people bitching about it being so short, it's a fucking tech demo. Do you want a full damn game to show off the new tech?"
4827,"Woke up on the beach with a crazy headache after a crazy party the night before. Went to church because the bartender/fisherman said something about a gun and a cute girl named Olga who's getting pounded by some guy named the Combine. Anyhow I shot down a helicopter and blacked out again after. Probably got roofied by the fisherman...

Serious Review: A small mission and isolated map perfectly placed in the HL universe. Cut from the final game but with a great, interactive story. Reminds me of Gordon's pit-stops on Highway 17. The graphics are stunning, especially compared to HL2. The mission could have been longer, but it's a playworth experience."
4828,l0ng3st g4m3 3v4r 10/10
4829,"(NON-CANNON) Absolutley beautiful graphically-- then again, that IS the purpose of this spinnoff, demonstration of new graphics. So far the closest we have to Half-Life 3."
4830,"Yes, we all know it's a tech demo/deleted scene, but there are far worse ways to pass half an hour. Solid level design, a wee bit of tension and a sassy fisherman make a fine combo."
4831,The greatest tech demo I've ever played.
4832,"So, you bought half life 2 and saw this in your library and though ""I wonder what this is?"". Well im here to tell you what this is, according to valve this is a tech demo (and a canceled extension to highway 17) to show off what the source engine can do, its quite short. So if you were wondering what this was, there you go."
4833,"Despite being quite short, the amount of detail of game development shown in this is amazing. Would like to see more of these!"
4834,"u wake up on beach drunk as fuck u find old man with giant pointy dildo he unlock gate u climb mounain kill faggot ass combine destroy a faggot ass dildo cannon and escape and destory a clit licking helicopter and take a fail elevator and u meet old man again and he invites u to a feast to eat leeches n shit  then u teleport away somehow cus u r high as fuck

IGN: ""i r8 dis 8/8"""
4835,"I think I found the coast...so, I guess I won?"
4836,if its lost how come i found it? it was a good graphics simulator
4837,not a game.
4838,"10/10 Really ! Do yourself a favor, if you own this game, PLAY IT !!! This is the best chapter of the original Half Life 2. It wasn't finished at game release, because it was so advanced that it took longer to perfect. Everything about this game is amazing. The sound effects, the voice acting, the characters, the visuals, water effects, gravity gun, the exploration, the many varied weapons and ammunition, the shootouts, the game play with keyboard and mouse. Don't rush through this game, do some exploring, throw objects around with the gravity gun, smash wooden objects; boxes,boats, find health, find armor repair, Towards the end you get unlimited bazooka ammo, to fire at enemies, helicopters, down towards the beach, at the rocks.  I found alot of replay value, because you can use different tactics, and learn how to make best use of your weapons. The Artificial Intelligence of the enemy is the best. PLAY IT, if you enjoyed Half Life 2, you will love Lost Coast it is a GEM !!! Play it with the commentary turned OFF."
4839,"Lost Coast is a deleted scene from Half-Life 2.  It doesn't add to the story, however.  It is a small area, a short map meant as a demo for some of the lighting effects of the Source engine.  

Despite being very, very short, it's also very satisfying to play.  If you have played Half-Life 2 and are looking for 30-60 minutes to kill, it's certainly worth pulling out."
4840,i dont know whats going on but everytime i play this my eyes bleed
4841,it's a short but amazing game it's got beautifule graphics and it's  more fun then a barrel of monkeys   i think it's awsome!
4842,A short and sweet visually stunning map with an available developer commentary at stratigic areas of the game.
4843,"Definately play this WITH commentary. If you're ever thinking of making a map or level for any game that has a function for mapmaking, the commentary on this game gives you great ideas."
4844,Fun but short. Dont buy it! Its fine if it comes free with something else but as play goes it is lack luster. The commentary is good but not worth spending cash on.  I recommend it only if it is free
4845,Best looking Source 1 game out there. And it's free with your copy of HL2. So there's no reason not to play it. (AND IT ISN'T $40. JESUS READ PEOPLE)
4846,This is pretty as hell. 9/10.
4847,"It's over in less that 10 minutes. Nice scenery, beautiful really, but there's not much in the way of content to this episode. Only get this if you're a real big Half-Life fan & it's on sale for less than $2 or even free."
4848,"A nice little test for when i upgrade my machine.
Plus a quick warm-up before online gaming."
4849,"Pretty pointless, not even worth playing - 20 minutes of game time.  Just stick to the main series.  Seems like a tech demo more than anything."
4850,Lost coast is a nice little edition. I recommend it for the walkthrough of commentary and its sdk properties.
4851,this was a really good game to be honest
4852,Just an explanation or commentary about the half-life universe
4853,"Half-Life 2 is arguably the best game ever made to date. It is a groundbreaking experience in interactive entertainment,"" states PC Gamer's Senior Editor, Chuck Osborn, ""While some games have groundbreaking visuals, or intellectually-challenging gameplay, or perhaps a cinematic story with good voice acting, not one has ever delivered the complete package. Half-Life 2 nails it, surpassing the original in every way."
4854,"The closest you can get to HL2 for free.

10/10"
4855,Don't farging Buy IT !!! It comes with Half Life 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4856,DONT BUY IT ITS TRASH
4857,"short!! didn't know it was a tech demo,but still awesome none a less!"
4858,"Do I recommend this game?

That depends: do I like playing showcases of things and not actual games?"
4859,"I am saddened to see this game not added to the original Half-Life 2 storyline as it certainly showed allot of promise, combining decent storyline with 'What-Can-This-Do?' gameplay. This being said, the Half-Life 2 story is long enough without this portion of fast paced action sequences and believe that Valve made the right decision by including this game in the purchase price off Half-Life 2 but not including it in the main storyline. 10/10"
4860,"Ooooh look, a tech demo!"
4861,"Try it out, nice dlc thing"
4862,i lost this game if you catch my drift
4863,a
4864,"If you hit ""up"" + ""down"" + ""right"" + ""W"" + ""A"" + ""Start"" + ""Select"" + ""3"", the door will open and you will have accest to Half-Life 3."
4865,the fisherman was nice
4866,I play this for the story.
4867,Got this game for free. If you can get it for that price it is definitely worth it.
4868,too short game for me
4869,"It's awesome that u give a tour like this, would be fun to have a more detailed version of it, such as story backgrounds and hidden events in the story etc!"
4870,"You can get this and hl2 for 10 not 30, just buy hl2"
4871,"good demo but no bueno on that price i just bought the orange box for $20 and i got this, portal, half-life 2 plus all the dlc's, and TF2 <--eventhough its free but for the price cant beat all that content :D"
4872,"A fun little tech demo, wish it was longer but the ""stress test"" is good for checking out new video cards/drivers"
4873,"It came with Half Life 2 in the Orange Box and it is very short. However after playing HL ep 2, its relaxing to play something with little to no plot. It wasn't a waste time, yet didn't add much to the Half Life experience over all."
4874,"good, but basically just a demo for half life two, good if you want to try it out but don't want to buy it"
4875,It is a interesting comentary.
4876,"Free addition to HL2. Was planned to be a chapte originally.
When I had no clue about speedrunning, I thought my 7 minutes were a good time."
4877,It's too old! Don't buy it
4878,"Like others have said, Tech Demo, no real point playing this."
4879,"First of all, I am new to Half Life and I don't know how to play it. I got this game from buying Counter Strike : Source (Retail) and when I installed CS:S, I got this game. I downloaded this game because I was very curious what Half Life is... I didn't understand the first part of the game cause I'm NEW... but then the game is really fun when I continued to the second. I really enjoyed the game..."
4880,"dont buy this get half life 2 this comes with it
"
4881,Wait what is this again? (BTW IT COMES WITH HL2 DON'T BUY STANDALONE)
4882,"There is only one level that is very short, easily completed in 14 minutes"
4883,"Lost Coast is the biggest waste of time and is a completely pointless game to play. Although it comes free with Half-Life 2 I’m just telling you that it’s not worth playing and is just pretty pointless at this time. It’s about 10 minutes of going up a cliff side and through a little town killing combine and killing a combine helicopter the end about 10 minutes that’s it. This map was initially supposed to be a level during the Highway 17 chapter in Half-Life 2 but was cut and then was used as a test for HDR which serves as the only point of this is to see Half-Life 2 in HDR. 

+Cool map
+Dev commentary
+Gabe says Gaben :)
+HDR

-Literally like 12 minutes or so of gameplay extremely short boring not worth playing
-I really don’t see the point in this whatsoever. It's a cut level so even then it’s a HDR test which I don’t see why is public and or is still given to players who buy Half-Life 2 as I’m sure Valve isn’t collecting results from this anymore. Would be nice if this would be sold independently as players could get this on their own accord instead of forcing everyone who buys Half-Life 2 this pointless game. 
-Remote Play doesn’t work

This is nice to see Half-Life 2 in HDR although personally I didn’t see much of a major difference from the main game. Even with this cool visual upgrade this demo was really short and uneventful and ik the whole point just to show off the HDR and listen to the dev commentary along with it. Personally I just felt it to be rather pointless to have bundled with Half-Life 2 as it’s put into your Steam library as a separate game. It would be nice if it was just an option to load into on the main game instead of being a seperate game all together. Otherwise it would be nice if you could just download it and play on your own instead of being forced to own this seperate game by buying Half-Life 2. Just rather pointless. I don’t feel like the HDR is so amazing that this is worth playing. 
"
4884,half life 2's  long lost brother???? after all it lost its meaning to play it and enjoy it.
4885,Recommended because of commentaries. :3
4886,"After having played this 5 minute demo for a total of 8 hours, I, a dead beat do approve."
4887,a cool tech demo tho worthless in my opinion.
4888,DONT BUY THIS GAME! no its not bad its a tech demo and its hella expinsive BUT its in a bundle with half life 2 so buy that game instead and you will also recive thisone and btw 40$ for a tech demo? WTF VALVE
4889,"short episode for TRUE HL fans.
8/10"
4890,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was supposed to be for Highway 17. Personally I don't know why they removed it. The puzzle solving in this is very true to regular Half-Life, (No duh) and for once you can kill the helicopter. The lighting is very nice and shows the true potential of the source engine, and quite honestly, the overall campaign (if you can call it that) wasn't half bad. (No pun intended) Overall, very nice if you want to get a bit more out of Half-Life. 

Final Score: 9/10"
4891,A great taste of what half life has to offer
4892,"Even as a short ""lost level"" and demo for some new modern graphical mess, Half-Life remains a style over substance yawnfest with poor gameplay."
4893,10/10 cried at the end
4894,Do not buy this game. I didnt buyed but it comes with Half Life 2 so if you gonna buy this i will come to your room and i will kill you :) . Have fun !
4895,11/10 loved the high dynamic range of the source engine
4896,"yes good for all my on steam and you can get it for free if you get half life 2

4898,"I played for exactly 43 minutes. I also finished the game. About 20 minutes were spent goofing off throwing boats at combine soldiers and marveling at the Pink and Black tiles that show up when you jump into the pirhanna infested water. Utterly Pointless. At least I got this when it was on sale for 80% off in a bundle with Half Life 2, which is AWESOME. So just get Half Life 2 by itself."
4899,Dear Esther + Adrenaline.
4900,loved it!
4901,"For a free little extra that came with the full version of Half Life 2, this was actually pretty enjoyable. It had the same basic gameplay and strategy as the rest of the game, and it had a decent setup. I give it 8.5 false HL3 confirmations out of 10.

Oh, and I am now part of the Steam minority who has actually PLAYED this demo. So I have that going for me, which is nice."
4902,Note: Read the sign! IT COMES WITH THE HL complete pack! Thats why it is 40 stinking bucks!
4903,"I find it funny that you can just buy half life 2 and get this along with it,better then spending 40.00 for the whole valve games that ran on the same engines as half life,minus portal."
4904,Its half-life 3. get it

10/10"
4906,piece of shit 20min
4907,Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is not so much of a game as it is a tech demo showcasing elements of the Source engine. It offers interesting commentary by the developers who are clearly passionate about their work while allowing you to briefly return as Gordon Freeman and take on enemies with all your old weapons. Established fans of the Half-Life series will get the most out of this experience.
4908,Good for free
4909,good
4910,"So I went back and replayed the half life series today, and I was inthralled in how immersive and massive the game felt. It was made in 2004, but it's beautiful by today's standards. The characters all feel so real and genuine. For anyone who hasn't played it, I strongly recommend you do.

Even this little tidbit, only one level, still conveyed a lot of the story to me, and I wish it was in the real game."
4911,"Lonely fisherman.

10/10"
4912,10/10 they should've gave me a map
4913,"Although it was purely for graphical demonstration, it was extremely good. You only play it once and not play it again, but it was a great demonstration."
4914,WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS?!
4915,"This is a great little piece of Half-life that was used in the original Source engine demos. They cut it from the game but I think it was never a part of it, just a tech engine level. Reason being, it used HDR lighting and that is a feature of the Source engine that HL2 didn't use at all. People were upset by that but hey, here it is now. It's fun, beat it in 19 minutes but it came with my HL2 purchase here on Steam. It wasn't advertised with it but it was included. It's nice to see, the HDR, but it's not a must own."
4916,"eh. got to shoot more face huggers.

8/10."
4917,"Well were to start:
1.Incredible description and beautiful graphics
2.Interesting and pretty teasing story but everybody expected more
3.nice character desing and pretty facinating place
4.Amaizing experience should try this
Even its short
#There is still a chance to get on the other side of the coast#
*BY:jumping from the first clif, after the first two combines, into the water*
!!!#Still there is nothing really to see but worth a try#!!!"
4918,its half life 2
4919,wow hdr such a new technology it looks so real
4920,"Though this only took ~half an hour to complete, it was still pretty entertaining. At first I though it may have been a whole expansion that I missed from the series, but it's just a short preview/demo/commentary type thing. 

This is included with half-life complete so chances are there's no need to explain/convince you to get this or play it. It all boils down to if you have any interest in what the developers of the game have to say. Very little on the story side, but fun nontheless."
4921,cool
4922,:(((((((((((((((
4923,"Don't buy this with money. It comes with Half-Life 2. And if you were planning to get this, just buy the Half-Life complete pack... it costs just as much as this..."
4924,"Dissapointingly short, but it's kinda fun, and the atmosphere is great."
4925,"It's half life. Everything Half Life is wonderful for all ages. Buy it and stop wondering if you should buy it. This is in the best of the best. Stop thinking and buy it. Half Life 1 and Half life 2 of all versions are very very good purchases. These are the keepers and will be in the short list of games you'll play and return to play again. Doesn't require huge amounts of graphics power and delivers a quality game that can be enjoyed by most everybody. The are pesky, nasty horrible invading aliens and they need to be stopped ;)"
4926,This had HDR in 2005. COD got HDR in 2013.
4927,boring 1/10
4928,I recomend all the half life games
4929,"Great game! Just dont buy it alone for $40, cause it does come with HL2, and I think other packs. Anyways, someone said it adds garrys mod props, so kudos. 10/10"
4930,"This comes bundled with HL2, so don't expect it to be bad. It's very short though, it's a one cut mission that also shows off HDR and Phong lighting."
4931,"The same awesomeness of HL2, just a lot shorter. I was very dissapionted how short this was. If this is free with HL2, then get it. Otherwise, don't. It isn't worth the extra money."
4932,"If you ever wanted to quickly show a friend what Half Life 2 was in a nutshell, you would have him play this. The real Half Life 2 demo does a poor job of explaining the game.

I love this game."
4933,for the price of this alone this is worthless if you want this game then buy half life 2 you get it for free
4934,goty
4935,its good
4936,"It's more of a bonus chapter to Half-Life 2 than anything, but for what it is, it's not bad, and the developer commentary is quite interesting if you're into that sort of thing. All in all, it's not bad considering it's given to HL2 owners for free."
4937,Amazing short demo
4938,BEST. SIDE-GAME. EVER!!!
4939,"If you want Half Life 2: Lost Coast, just get HL2 Ep1, it has 4 different games.  The way they plan on setting up their next games is shown in this small game.  I look forward to how they use some of these techniques."
4940,this comes free with the 10 $ half life 2. So why is it so expensive?
4941,Too cool for u
4942,I finished it 19 minutes .................. just showing the HDR and other graphical part......
4943,yea short 6/10
4944,"I've played a lot of games, This game Sucks dickhole"
4945,eh it was good but not half life good
4946,WORTH 99 BUCKS
4947,"This is a nice little game. The graphics are great and so is the voice acting. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Half-Life, like me. Or to anyone who loves this type of game."
4948,Hi. I just posted this review to make this game seem more popular.
4949,"If you want a more full-filling half-life 2 story, get it with the HL2 sale or bundle. The add-on was pretty good for the most part, but the mission was is only like 15-30 min. I finnished the game in 9 to 12 min. because i thought there was more to it or that you can walk around and explore the island. But all you really do is blow up the combine missile ""lancher"" , it sounds fun, but more like a tech demo then anything, even though it gives you more textures and better looking game, get it on a sale."
4950,"It is a fine ""game"". It is a short little mission where you go to the top of a mountain to destroy a headcrab pod launcher. Just buy Half Life 2 and this comes free, or at least it did with me. DO NOT SPEND THE MONEY TO BUY ONLY THIS!!!!!"
4951,"This is a very interesting showcase of HDR in Half Life 2, and I hope that Valve includes little addons like this for their games in the future. This outtake level of Half Life 2 has commentary from Valve develpers that explain how certain things work to make the game very realistic. From explaining when they change up the gameplay to showing how some texture mapping works, I enjoyed this half-hour(no pun intended)of playing Half LIfe 2: Lost Coast."
4952,"This is just a short demo game Valve made to show off their new engine. This was a while ago (therefore engine is no longer new, lol).
Do not expect any long gameplay or anything, it is precisely what it looks like - just one chapter.
Not much storyline either, but graphics and level design are good."
4953,"The graphics sure rock! I only have a radeon 7770 with 1650x1080, but it reallly looks great.
The blinding effect of going from darkness into daylight is well done (but I hve seen blinding in HL2...), the explanation for refraction / reflection effects is clear and well implemented.
"
4954,"I beat this in 12 minutes. Meh, it's ok. Short, but adequate for a Half-Life game. Free when you buy Half-Life 2."
4955,"1 chapter, more of a graphics test then anything, but if you have money to burn then its definently worth looking into for 30 minutes of entertainment"
4956,first a question is there any other chapters/levels in this game besides 1 if so tell me and it could be awesome if it had more than the other game had like giant robots and please make a half life3
4957,NIceee
4958,DO NOT BUY THIS!!! If you actually buy this pointless 10 min game for the current price of 39.99 $ then you need mental help. Not meant to offend anyone. Just please do not buy this.
4959,"epic, niot enough players get to experience this kind of, action, drama, and character development. the only part i did not like was having to see alex's boobs. i think that this was immature even though it showed how well source can render spheres. 10/10 must play"
4960,"[h1]Benchmark[/h1]

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is basically a planned, then scrapped level of Half Life 2 that Valve decided to release for free anyway to showcase some of the stuff they can do with their Source engine. It is actually the first Valve game to utilize developer commentary, a feature Valve would use for (this is to my knowledge) Episode One, Episode Two, Portal 1, Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2 and Portal 2. So, this just shows how much success you can have if you experiment with new things.

The ""game"" itself (if you can call it) isn't that good, though. You're done in about 5-10 minutes and there is barely any replay value. However, this is balanced out by Lost Coast being a free game, but still. Kinda dampens the experience.

Overall, Half Life 2: Lost Coast is a decent experience that you should only get for free."
4961,"It's the Wales of games.

Not bad, Not good.

?"
4962,I do not recamend buy this itselfe. I do not think it's worth 40$. Yes it is a fun lvl when you get with with orange box. but i don't think you shuld buy it becuz you don't have it
4963,"This is a great little game. The graphics are comparable to games being made today and it is enough of a challenge (on hard mode) to keep you occupied for a while. Unfortunately, due to the length of the game, it is really not worth paying the £2.99 to get it. Buy it in a package, for example Half life complete, if you really want it. Overall i'd give it 7/10 for playability butonly 2/10 value for money."
4964,THis is not a game. It's a $40 demo. dont fuck yourself over buying it.
4965,"Not really. I'm not sure if you can buy this stand alone because it came with the HL pack I bought, but if you can don't. It'd be mega stupid seeing how this is just a tech demo."
4966,gaben@valvesoftware.com
4967,small
4968,"Yeah....an ok game i will have to admit. But kinda less what i was exspecting. The gameplay shows off some impresseve new graphics' but the gameplay is kinda short, Which i was disappionted the most about. But the upside of this game is the graphics, which i was impressed the most about. it shows what computers can do to video games now a,days. Our technololgy has increased during the years. and we can create video games in the comfort of our own home. So think of this game of a trailer of what valve is capable doing now a days. it brings excitment to what half life 2 episode 3 is going to look like. And would call this game more of a demo then a exciting adventure. Its still a game. and its not horrible, in fact its kinda epic and i would give it a (4 out of 5). I like it. Its not bad."
4969,"A very nice demo of how the game (hl2) works and its design features / engine. Make sure to read the little speech bubbles for the interesting commentery by the developers. Btw- this is not intended to be a game, this is a demo showing Half Life 2's elements and design features. It also has very nice graphics that are shown off well, especially for 2005 standerds! 

-It comes with Half Life 2 for free."
4970,The game auto-defaulted to max settings 10/10 would be complimented by a game again.
4971,I will buy it :) But damn ... i have to wait some arent i ?
4972,A fun but short little expansion
4973,"it is a very short gameplay but is fun to listen to the comentary and how they had created the game
"
4974,I got the Orange box for $15 AUS and It came with this as a edditon. Tho why the heck is it $30 US for 12 minutes of gameplay.
4975,little more than a tech demo but worth it over all
4976,A fisherman enables the vandalism of an ancient monastary and multiple homicides by granting a known fugitive access.
4977,"I purchased this game and went through all sorts of troubleshooting steps. I went through probably two days of trying to get this game to actually work. Then, suddenly, I could finally start playing it. But it's more like I only purchased a demo (but I didn't) because the game crashes the second the game starts to sprinboard into any direction after the training is pretty much finished."
4978,A good little level to show how valve is going to improve the graphic quality of thier games. Its recomended if you turn on the commentary because you can get a little more from this and have a longer playtime
4979,fucking hackers in this game
4980,get lost on pirate hooker island
4981,i like half life 2 before this boring as shit
4982,"I don't recommend this game nor do I hate this, but basically it's just a little demonstration on Valve's new Half-Life 2 technology made 7 years ago for High Dynamic Range, or something like that.
Note: I know I'd do Opposing Force next, but this review was very short, so I did it very fast, hell it took me a minute to write this review, which really isn't a review"
4983,Graphics is great. Very short game though. Anyways enjoyed it. Recommended if you are half life fan & want to complete every series ;)
4984,wtf?
4985,"A 10 minute long tech demo. Just one mission. Don't bother with it, rather watch a review on youtube"
4986,most underatted
4987,really god lots of weapons and gravity stuff
4988,"I suppose that this is a fine addition to Half-Life 2, even though it includes only one level and is ridiculously short. Could take you about half an hour to finish, but I think that it is still worth it."
4989,"Its worth it beacuse it only comes in the Valve complete pack, but if this game was still availible to purchase by itself, I would not buy it beacuse its really short and doesnt really entertain unless your one of those people (like me) who like to see how the games are made. If you get Half life: complete, play this game, and make sure you turn on the developer commentary! Thats pretty much the entire point of the game, beacuse it focuses on how Valve diescovered new ways of developing the source engine after Half Life 2: Episode 2 was released. If this was available to buy by itself, I would assume that Valve only released this short, basic game to earn an extra few thousands of dollars or so, but also beacuse they wanted to show the players the new way they came up with making the graphics for the source engine, the character animations, and the lighting affects. If you are a developer, this is a good game to play if youre testing out your Source scripts or something. I think this is a pretty good game. I recomend the it. Don't wonder why I typed so much for a game that you can't even purchase without buying the entire pack, but I just feel like typing right now. Well, thats all. Goodbye. P.S, don't think im an idiot if you look at this game its its perfectly available to buy, when I wrote this, it wasnt available, and I don't know if it ever will be available to buy by itself again."
4990,"When I bought this game at the store the guy sold it to me for 50 dollers, now I know that you kids are getting it for free these days but the concept that people will always take free things is WRONG

don't take this game and go fuck yourself"
4991,Pretty good.
4992,GG
4993,"Fun, but not worth buying separately."
4994,I remember when this looked like the best thing on PC. I was interested in the commentary provided.
4995,"Get this bundled with Half Life 2, its mildly interesting, but like others said its pretty short. The fact that this is posted for 40 bucks is almost criminal."
4996,"LOVE THIS GAME, Good time killer"
4997,"This game is fun if 1: You like killing Combines. 2: If you like physics. And 3: If you want a behind the scenes commentary. I liked this game. It was short and sweet. Not  too much, not too little. The only downside is at the end, it leaves you hanging, craving for more. This game comes with Half-Life 2."
4998,很好很强大
4999,A fun yet short look into game design.
5000,"DO NOT BUY THIS, JUST BUY HALF - LIFE 2 FOR $9.99

i dont understand why this is $40. if youve never played half life before this is NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO BUY. it must be a error like maybe they ment to put $3.99 but instead its $39.99. ALL THIS IS IS A TECH DEMO THAT WAS FREE WITH ONE OF THE EPISODES. ITS PRICE MUST BE AN ERROR

THIS IS NOT AN EPISODE.


YOU MEAN TO BUY HALF -  LIFE 2 TRUST ME"
5001,"39.95 for a 15 minute game. i don't know if it was worth it, but i got it for free with half life 2"
5002,good
5003,Completed it in 27 minutes?This was horrible...
5004,i wasnt sure wat i was playing but it was amazing
5005,"Awesome little tech demo, just not worth the money if you buy it stand alone. istead buy it with Half-Life 2 and get it"
5006,Deep...
5007,Fun
5008,"Short and sweet, fun fact this is the first time Valve used the commentary bubble system in a game."
5009,Small Game BUt meant to be play :)
5010,More like Half-life 2.75
5011,i bought this with the orange box but i saw that it cost 40.00 by itself and i saved alot of money. It was super short and the graphics were ok and it was only 17 min and i would not recomend this standalone
5012,its like a mini half life. loads of fun
5013,"Ground-breaking graphics, an enthralling and deep storyline, and invigorating gameplay provide more than enough bang for your buck. Lost Coast is unlike any other game I've seen or played, even differentiating itself from the game series it belongs to. The game is perhaps one of the most intense walking simulations to have ever existed, with only 30 minutes of gameplay Valve has accomplished more than I had thought possible.

If not the best story ever told in any medium to have ever existed, it is, at the very least, the best story ever told in the medium of video games. Truly one of the best experiences anyone could hope to have in their lifetime, you may as well give up now if your intention is to find anything with the capability of surpassing the masterpiece that is Half-Life 2: Lost Coast. This will be what you think about as you lie on your death bed. ""If only I could have replayed Lost Coast one more time..."" as you come to rest, never to wake up again, left only with the regret of not replaying this game hundreds of times over."
5014,Good level but it went by to fast.
5015,"Dear Esther like 5 years before it, longer."
5016,This is a presentation of some new Source Engine Graphics but still it's cool...
5017,"It's literally a tech demo. not much to it, no major plot developments, worth skipping"
5018,"This game has such a great introduction for the new Half-Life 2 Engine, the new graphics made me feel more alive and more action-ish. It's fun to play even though the story of this game is not connected to other Half-Life series."
5019,"took me less than 20 minutes to beat it, its a single mission and its not even that hard. don't waste your money."
5020,"Hi, this is Gabe Newell, and welcome to the Lost Coast. In this tour, we're going talking about a new graphics technology we've been developing, called High Dynamic, Ranged Lighting, to HDR. We'll also be giving you some insight into the design and production challenges during the construction of the Lost Coast. First, a quick explanation of the commentary system. To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press the +USE key. To stop the commentary, put your crosshair over the commentary node and press your +USE key again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game for the purpose of showing something to you. In these cases, simply pressing your +USE key will stop the commentary.

"
5021,there is not much right now but i bet this game will be awsome in the future
5022,"wtf was the point in this?

10/10"
5023,"I think this game is a few seconds dropped away. DLC small and quick, else cost almost 20 dollars. Would I download something other than it just a little map, isn't game."
5024,"It's a very short tech demo showing off some of the features of Source Engine. Worth getting along with something else, if you can, but not worth purchasing for itself. As it can only be had via Packs (at least at the time of writing), weigh the pack purchase based off of the other games you're currently lacking - if there's some that warrant picking up the whole pack? Sure. You get this along with it.

But if you just don't have this and a couple other things you don't necessarily want/need? Don't bother."
5025,en edes tiennyt että omistin mutta hyvä oli
5026,"Lost Coast is a nice demo to say the least. It superbly shows off the great visuals of the Half Life 2 world. I would not say however, it is not much more than that. I finished it within half an hour (mostly lag time, which I blame on my mac, not the game). I would reccomend it as a great way to show friends how half life works, without worrying about long gameplay."
5027,It was good but I was wrong to think it would be a full game or a half game like Half Life 2 Episodes 1 and 2. It was a short mission at best but the graphics were cool.
5028,Some people don't know how to read and think this tech demo is 40 dollars.
5029,"To prevent confusion before purchase: This isn't much of  a game, more of a demo indicating all of the elements that go into the making of half life games. If you're into game dev, have a look at this. Note that it is very short."
5030,A free extra mission that lasts about 30 minutes.  3/5 lambdas.
5031,Its not what I expected but I learned alot!
5032,хорошая проверака халфы 2
5033,Lost Coast is just a playable tech demo that showcases Valves Source engine. It's not cannon with the story but it's fun to play through. If you're a die hard HL2 fan then give this one a shot.
5034,"Being 40 bucks by itself is quite the money for a mere showcase, but being an addon that I got for free when I bought half life I can't complain, it's great! The showcase of source engine was impressive and would even be my favorite chapter if it were part of any of the games, cant wait till source 2 will be done! (Thats my prediction for the announcement of hl3 or e3 2014)"
5035,The Game is EXCELLENT however if more Chapters would have been there that would have been Fantastic. The game currently features ONLY 1 CHAPTER. Why was it left like that and not Completed?
5036,Short but fun. Not worth any money at all. Yay.
5037,Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a quick thirty minute tops extra gamplay from everything you loved about Half-Life 2. It starts you out with a nice arsenal and throws you straight into combat. It is intense and awsome as you fight many armed soldiers on cliffsides while moving on into the city in street combat. Ammo is plentiful as your facing many skilled combatants and even a helicopter towards the end. Altogether a quick action packed experience full of excitment.
5038,"Wow, really good graphics for a 2005 engine. Shows what the Source engine was capable of back then.

Don't buy this standalone - it comes bundled with several Valve titles."
5039,"Cute little level, should've been added to the game in my opinion."
5040,"The sheer level design and attention to atmospheric detail is what makes ANY Half-Life addition an absolute must. This is a single level, very short, and primarily a showcase of the Source engine's capabilities, but it puts you in the shoes of Gordon Freeman again and that is an opportunity that you should enjoy to the fullest."
5041,"It's actually really fun

10/10"
5042,Why did I even install this
5043,"Originally a level that was designed for the original Half-Life 2, Lost Coast is merely a tech demo showcasing Valve Corporation's source engine and what it can do.  It literally only lasts for a third of an hour, but it was fun seeing where the droppods that spout the head crabs orignially came from.  If you're on the fence of wanting Half-Life 2, this short demo will help you decide, but it's not going to show everything from the getgo (it is a demo after all).  Getting The Orange Box will automaticaly make Lost Coast avaiable free of charge, and it is definitely worth its free price.  (And really, why pay extra for a tech demo anyway?)  Ultimately, I felt that this short demo was not really worth my time, but at least for Half-Life fans, you'll have something else to add to your collection."
5044,it took 10 mins to complete and it cost 26 quid luckialy i got it in the half life bundel when it was on sale
5045,"It's meh, mission was kind of confusing because it didn't show a clear way to actually get up the mountain, it has maybe a 1 hour gameplay, and I personally believe that this was probably made for nvidia users only (pardon my ignorance if it was probably mentioned) because the world was broken to hell, I almost didn't finish it because I couldn't even see the helicopter.

4/10 stars
Also, to everyone saying ""this wasn't worth ten dollars"" or shit like that, keep in mind that you get Lost Coast when you purchased Half Life 2 (recommended), you don't really have to download it if you don't want to, this was just a mission to show off some fancy shmancy lighting and graphics, I played it out of sheer curiosity, and the map is available on Garry's mod if you have both Lost Coast and Garry's mod if you just want to see the map to know what I mean aboutit being broken.

That's all"
5046,"This short game demo showcases the technology used in Half-Life 2.  If you're interested in game development, or have never played Half-Life this is well worth the time.  It's a good sample of the gameplay and describes some of the techniques behind the graphics.  You can also perform a stress test on your hardware and it will tell you what your average FPS is.  I wish more game developers produced this kind of content."
5047,This is a really awesome game! I had lots of Enjoying moments when racing my friends over the Steam chat.
5048,"20-30 minute level. It's fun, but not really anything special or worth playing."
5049,"It's not a full game, just a benchmark to test your computer but I would still recommend trying it out!"
5050,"Don't get you're hopes up, it isn't an adventure by any means, but a ten minute tech demo which shows off a very groundbreaking *new* lighting engine that is still being used and adapted on Today.

I'd play it for the developer's commentary, I found it very insightful into how graphics, gameplay and how Valve's game design works.

It's only about 200 megabytes and it's free with Half-Life 2 so I'd reccomend you find some time to load it up and give it a shot!"
5051,too short game :/
5052,"It's short but interesting, love the commentery you should check that out, they explain lot of things in the game!"
5053,"   Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a very short but enjoyable game. It was originally intended to be released with Half-Life 2 but was then later cut. It takes roughly twenty minutes to complete but is worth playing for sure.
   Of coarse, we once again step into the shoes of Gordon Freeman as he hikes up the steep cliffs of the Lost Coast. On his way, he'll encounter several different combine soldiers. As he pushes on, you'll find Gordon inside of a monastery in which he needs to destroy a combine weapon. Short afterwards, he'll step out into the world only to get rained down upon by an combine helicopter. Upon completing his mission, Gordon makes his way back down the mountain to once again talk to the old man.
   You'll have to play the game yourself to find out who this mysterious man and to see what he has in store for you... 
   All in all, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was an enjoyable experience and I would recommend it to other players."
5054,I got this game for free on a mac but now it's only PC compatible and costs 30 dollars. I'm so confused but okay. Also it's just a quick mission so nothing to get hyped about.
5055,"Meh. Play it for fun, then delete it"
5056,it's a good but i want something more in the game make it longer so it last for weeks.
5057, comes with hl2
5058,I love Half-Life i'v played all the games but lost coast i a bit to short still it's a good game.
5059,THIS SUCKS MY PICKLE
5060,This game looked very fun at first then 5 minutes later I finished the game. Then I never played it again...
5061,"Not as long and thrilling like the previous Half Life games, but still very fun and exciting. The graphics are amazing and it comes with a built in stress test benchmark and a high qaulity voice through about the making of the game. I highly recommend this to anyone who played any Half life games before. It is a bit too short but other than that it is excellent. I give Half Life 2: Lost Coast a 9/10."
5062,I felt as a game in general this was a complete rip off...BUT as a game to show what the source engine can do this is a GREAT game.
5063,When the fudge did i get this ha
5064,"This is not a game. This was orginially a demo for Half-Life 2 and the Source Engine. Now for some FAQ:

""Is it good?"" Sorta
""WTF! IT IS 39.99 FOR A DEMOZ!!!! VALVE SCAM!?"" Click the name and look at the page*.
""Why don't they sell this speratly so I can see if I like Half-life 2?"" I really don't know.

This game, because it is a demo, shows you all of the cool things that the engine can do in-game. I like this more because it seems to be filled with action (also not repetitive). It is a good time killer for only 15-30 mins. I give it a 7.5/10.


* If you type in ""Lost Coast"" the price will be shown as 39.99. If you press on the tile-thing and look the the page for it, it will only be able to be sold with the bundle, that is why it is that much."
5065,"Really is a showcase for the souce engine and what it is capable of. Felt too short. But has a decent amount of work into it , so it deserves my recommendation"
5066,i like it
5067,Great expansion on Half-Life 2
5068,Fun to play but i wouldn't suggest buying this unless it comes in the Orange Box or Half- Life: Complete bundles. Very expensive for a single level that can be completed in 15 mins.
5069,"its the best game ever
"
5070,"This game cant really be called a game, but I must say I do like hearing how valve made half-life 2."
5071,"Comes with the Orange Box at no extra charge, so im okay with it
It appears to be a tech demo, a part of HL2 they never finished
Turn on DEV commentary, it explains the story behind HL2LC"
5072,It's nothing more than one extra level for HL2 that has revamped graphics.  It was good to have it while I waited for HL2 to finish downloading.
5073,"It's hard to talk about any story in this game. This production shows refreshed SOURCE engine. I like that.
My niggaz like this too."
5074,"Not sure if it was this one or another one, but If I remember correctly it was this one,and it was short as all hell. Not worth 40$ for such a short experience."
5075,I actually liked it. HDR will look bery good in hl3 and hl2:ep 3
5076,"Not bad of a game, but gameplay is to short not gud i dun like."
5077,"it is a good game but its too short i think it needs to be extended a lot more and you should make it free to play but than why waste 37 something dollars on this very short game thats is only on a cliff side it needs more action please extend it and make it free to play ti snot worth so much money THX :D i also go tlal of your other half lfie style games :)
"
5078,"Please don't buy it, this is a technology demo. You should receive it with any of Half-Life bundles."
5079,"nice little HL2 extra about the same length as Half life b4 Mod
Beautiful graphics wow
A revamped source engine (Idk what its called) can't wait to see future HL games in this definition 

3/5
-Not a half life full game. but still pick it up if you can"
5080,sss-gooood!!! But short.
5081,REALLY COOL!
5082,don't buy this for $40 it's only 20 minutes long and isn't even that hard
5083,"The most interesting part about this chapter which was cut from Half-Life 2 is probably the developer-commentary in which lead designers from Valve talk about leveldesign and HDR. Quite fun, if you want to have a few background information.

... AND LOST COAST IS NOT 30 $ !!! You can only get it in the Half-Life or Valve complete pack and it's not even available as a standalone !!! This one is for free guys! 
[b]What you pay for are all the other games in the pack![/b]"
5084,"to the people complaining its too short, it was a scrapped level from half life 2. considering you can only buy it with the complete pack, think of it as a free addon."
5085,This should have remained lost.
5086,i love the sailor!!!!
5087,this game was really short and sent you right into the action withort a tutorial. that is unlike you valve. plus there was absolutly no plot and is bad even on beta standards.
5088,"If this is $40.00 and ONLY comes with the one Lost Coast map, and someone buys it, i can't blame them for crapping bricks. I love the Hl2 series, I mean honestly the best games i played as a young gamer, and still i play it as yet to be a lot older. It sucks though how valve decided to stop making Single player games, and go to multiplayer, if they DID make more single players, i would buy it, and im pretty sure ALOT of others would buy it, not just cause of the gameplay, but for the memories."
5089,i couldn't quick scope 4 FaZe :(((( dis gayme sux
5090,More a technology demo than a game it further whets the appetite for Half Life 3.  Wandering around a beautrfully rendered environment with some limited FPS action you get the feeling this was a half hearted attempt to make a game out of a demo.  Still even half hearted attempts in this universe can be fun.
5091,"short, but really nice!"
5092,"pretty dang good game, the new graphic design features make the game more interesting. please release more chapters soon"
5093,Total waste of money. This is a single mission which lasts literarly 10 minutes and it is extremely easy. Never buy this crap.
5094,"This game was pretty fun, i was abit shocked about the fact i had finished it in about 15-20 minutes but it was a fun little game :) like a taste of Half-Life 2 with the weapons and all, it came when i bought Half-Life 2 so no need to worry about getting it on its own :)
"
5095,"shit game,fuck you fisherman in this game,eat a sack of whale shit"
5096,This is just a demo of the Half-Life 2 engine. It's an incomplete mission that has you killing a few Combine and then that's it. I wouldn't recommend downloading this unless you want to waste time installing it and spend 15 minutes playing it before you get bored and boot up Team Fortress 2 again.
5097,"Campaign was too long. Worst game ever.
10/10"
5098,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was never really supposed to exist.  It existed as a benchmarking tool for Half-Life 2, and ended up becoming a stand alone single level game.  Since it really wasn't designed to be a game to begin with, there simply isn't much content.  If you really love the Half-Life series, and you are determined to play out all of the games and mods available, finish it in about 10 minutes.  Otherwise, don't bother."
5099,"This wasn't really much of an extention to the game, more like, it's a view into what wasn't displayed. It's always fun to go into these kind of levels where you see what the developers go through, and how they plan out the game. I did have the expectation that it would be another level, which like Half Life and Half Life 2 have taught me, takes quite a while to do. But This is just as great, learned plenty and love what they did with the graphics engine!"
5100,"Decent if you're bored, but don't have a large period of time to play a full Half Life game between classes. Not really a whole lot to say about it otherwise. It's nice as a tech demo or a quick time killer."
5101,It was ok... there was nothing special about it.
5102,"THIS IS NOT A GAME
It is just a demonstration of their new graphics and only takes 20 minutes to complete.
I suppose it could be good though if you wanted to learn a bit more about valve and what they have to do to make their games but still not worth the 20 + pounds for it"
5103,great dev preview really nice showcasing the HDR
5104,"Short gameplay, good graphics, and a nice rocket launcher. Would recommend."
5105,"Cool addition to HL2 but doesn't really have a story. Still fun, hoping more episodes."
5106,i love this demo it shows how valve care about the games they make i hope to see more for diffrent games
5107,"Not worth the full price, just a game showing off the engines and physics and stuff. Good fun though, worth playing if it came with the bundle!"
5108,"I am dissapointed. I didnt think this was a single mission in 14 min game but a hole new game like HL2 or P2. It only shows some light and add a few new props to Gmod. You dont get any kind of background infomation but you just wake up at a random beach and you need to climb up a cliff, killing combine, take down a helicopter at the top, get down again. THATS FUCKING IT!"
5109,"BAD. one map for 27,99 euros.are they sick i have the game and im terrefied.BORING STUPID BAD AND UNFUNNY"
5110,Nice one review for half life 2
5111,yeh
5112,It's just a 20 minute mission with commentary that talks about some aspects of half-life 2's design. Pretty cool though.
5113,...pretty
5114,"really short, but enjoyable for a free tech demo. The enhanced source engine is really snazzy looking too."
5115,"It was a great techdemo in 2005, but why would anybody pay to play this now?"
5116,"If you're looking for a new Half-Life adventure, this isn't your answer. This is more of a graphics test. But those graphics sure are pretty!"
5117,"I got this from a CD download from a best buy, but they want 40 bucks for this shit?! ITS ONE MOTHER FUCKING LEVEL. Don't buy it......"
5118,Awesome extra for half life 2. short but sweet a great pick up and play level for a quick in and out experience.
5119,"Back in 2008 I got this Source engine tech demo thanks to EVGA's graphics card, which I owned at that time. I checked it and then forgotten, because I did not know what to do at some point.

Recently I decided to try it again, on my new laptop.

Well, I thought I will get the same presentation, but I was wrong. Graphics improvement and commentary changed the whole experience. It was really great to hear developers and learn quite a few things about technology and graphics.

I hope, that Valve do not stop at this point and will update this presentation with new features or maybe prepare a new presentation, when new engine will be released."
5120,"This is a short, tech demo. Limited story, very limited. You talk to a guy, parkour on a cliffside, shoot alot of guys in a small church and you're done!"
5121,Best Gaym Da Sereze
5122,"Protip: Contact Gabe Newell at gaben@valvesoftware.com
Note: Above is the biggest end-of-game plot twist evar"
5123,Great for the developer comments. And just that.
5124,Very not fun shoot cat pee burn jump i love to the game 10 out of ten
5125,"Better than all Half Life games. Buy it now, no matter the cost.
I'm just joking, this game isn't really a game. A demonstration in fact of how glorious the Source Engine can be. If you want gameplay over graphics don't buy this."
5126,"Glad i got this for free with HL2 because it is the shortest game ever nfact i think its either a small ""map"" or they just havn't finished making it."
5127,"Short and not great, graphics are the same, way too mcuh money for this little expansion $30! Now that is SHIT PRICE!"
5128,"Just VALVe showing off their new graphic system.....
Nothing else.
Even though it came with Half-Life 2, which is an amazing game, its not worth installing, minimal story.  Not much to enjoy here.

3/10"
5129,"its a cool tech demo I guess, nice water effects though"
5130,#playitoncethenneverplayitagain
5131,"super..
"
5132,"Definitely the best installation in the whole Half-Life series. The depth of plot is unfathomable, the the shading of the characters' motives is astonishing, and finally the highly dynamic range of gameplay's variations leaves no one indifferent. A masterpiece overshadowed by the original game's success.
Even now, I cannot get the rays of of enlightenment to stop astonishing me with their clear white light every time I play this magnificent game."
5133,Wasn't keen. Got it for free though.
5134,"Less than an hour of thorough playthrough. With just one non-story-related level, this is more of a tech demo for HDR and dynamic shadows. Thankfully, they make it clear in the description."
5135,"Impressive game, very bealtiful graphics and engine works well, recomended !

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5j3XFvPZpU"
5136,fun short mission its good
5137,A short taste of what HL2 represents in terms of gameplay and graphics.
5138,Decent demo
5139,"Pssst...don't buy this stand-alone, it comes with HL2...."
5140,not bad kinda short But really great graphics
5141,a
5142,i loved the graphics and everything but then i realised it was one of the shortest chapters ever i guess it must be just a mission
5143,I have no idea what the hell this is I'm guessing its just a demo as Joker said. Not worth the install.
5144,"Lets just be clear; Half Life 2: Lost Coast is not a full game expansion. It is just a tech demo and can be played through in less than half an hour, since I got the Half lIfe Complete Pack for $10 I am okay with this, but I could not imagine paying $20 for this. If you played through the other Half-Lifes and are THAT desperate for more Half-Life then you should get it, because I really don't think Half-Life 3 is going to come out any time soon(If at all!)"
5145,when did i buy this
5146,"JUST AN ENGINE DEMONSTRATION, HARDLY ANY GAMEPLAY. (Although it is kinda pretty . . . )"
5147,half life is a first person shooter and this might be a dlc i dont know but its look real when you get the game and play it heres something for whoever reads this review 1st put on console (`) 2nd enter sv_cheats 1  3rd put in noclip witch will make you fly (but it will breck the game) or put in god witch will make you lose no blood level or put in impulse 101 witch will give you all of the weapons in the game From roy.batchelar(i dont care if my name appers under my profile picture).
5148,"EDIT: i realized this is a source engine test, i was ignorant in 2013 and didn't know it was a single level.


OLD: ill say to be honest 20.00$ for a crao game like lost coast is gay it has like 10 minutes of game play and costs alot more than an avrage game costs try bleed or terraria or somthing else like halflife 2"
5149,"That's crazy they sell this thing for 40$: it's just a cut level from Half-Life 2. 40$ for a 15 minutes preview? Sure, Valve."
5150,"review: epic
conclusion: epic"
5151,why buy the lost coat it comes with the half life 2 game? so TURN AWAY from this!
5152,Yeah it was ok but the bad thing is that it takes like 10 min to play it but ok :D
5153,a ok
5154,"This ""game"" serves to nicely showcase many of the innovations in Half-Life 2. If you like Half-Life 2 or are interested in game development, this is a nice, cheap way to engage both of those interests. It is extremely short, however (less than 1 hour). Just be forewarned."
5155,"It's not what you think. Honestly, it's extremely boring..."
5156,"No real story here, but think Half Life 2 tech demo.

The highlight here is HDR, and is really intended for technical interest.

If you aren't into learning about the technical parts of the Source engine, don't download.

No gameplay rating to be given from me, but for technical features at Lost Coast's release: 9/10."
5157,buy hl2 instead because it comes with it and its cheaper
5158,"Not that great, but hey it comes free with Half Life 2 so can't complain much."
5159,ˆ†æß ©®´´å†
5160,Glitchy. Low-quality. Aweful. How do I remove this from my Steam?
5161,"Nice piece of game, a big demostration of Source engine. If you want to see how cool Half-Life can look like, try it, yeh"
5162,omg grafickz
5163,"Short and sweet, a nice tech demo for the new stuff that they were doing with the source engine. If you're expecting anything revolutionary, or story-driven, you will be disappointed."
5164,"meh, its a thing."
5165,"Well, first of all, the game is great, not just this one but the entire series, and it really is what it was promised to be, a part of the game that wasn't included, just a display of a extremely rich and awesome light effect.

There's nothing to discuss about it, there is just two points.

+ : Great effects, a good ""mini""-game when you just want to shoot combine jerks but don't want to install half-life, great lightning ( I'll say as many times as it takes, GREAT. LIGHTNING. EFFECTS.).

- : You'll have to buy it alone, or with a half-life bundle ( like i did), i can understand why it wasn't in the game, at least i imagine why, but seems kind of obvius.

Thanks for reading!."
5166,Very short but very beautiful.
5167,"Very Short, Fun little map."
5168,"I found lost coast to be actually really fun. Its a great chapter. While short, its also free and fun! Ive spent a lot of that time trying to spear combine! Its soo stupid but fun!"
5169,">$39 for a broken demo that has hd
GabeN, you're pushing how much we'll waste"
5170,"This will be the most helpful review for any game, EVER.

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast looked amazing back then, and still does to this very day. As short as this ""game"" is... it's something you must experience."
5171,"Half Life is an Amazing Series but Lost Coast didn't cut it for me. Alright, it's fun to play and I enjoy the Gameplay. But there isn't really much to it and the game is over in Minutes."
5172,"I came into this knowing well that it would not be a full game, but merely a demo. However, I'm still greately dissatisfied. While my computer is not quite top of the line and quite a large step from it, I am able to play Episode 2(which honestly has much better lighting than this and wasn't realeased all that long after this) at between 30-60fps on maximum graphical settings. I got no higher than 40fps and it dropped as low as 15fps at times on this. I wonder if it might be poorly optimized, considering so little gameplay exists in a ""game"" that is so large in size. It's roughly a quarter the size of Half Life 2 itself.(half life 1 is close in size to this, I haven't even finished it and I'm more than 3 hours in if I remember correctly!) I have, and this is for apparently 30-40 minutes of gameplay. I'm glad this only cost me a few extra bucks from my buying the Orange Box, I'd be infuriated beyond levels describable if I had to pay $30+ for basically a graphical demo."
5173,"I am suprized how good this game actualy is it may cost much but i asure you its worth it
"
5174,"it is a nice game,but it is soo freaking small.. do more ""episodes"" do a story"
5175,"It features great graphics and environments showing what the Source engine is capable of. The game is very simple and short and features shooting, climbing, puzzles and a small boss fight with a chopper. The game is a fun experience and lets you enjoy the great graphics while playing, VALVE GREAT! I recommend it!"
5176,"Good performance test, but nothing more."
5177,"Short game , graphics are good.."
5178,"This game had ten minutes of gameplay. I didn't really enjoy it, but it did an okay job of showing off the features they wanted to put in a game. You meet a man who tells you to go kill people. You kill people and meet the man again."
5179,"This game is a great piece of art demonstrating all of the components leading to the new version of SOURCE, I find it very interesting and a fun little game."
5180,Cool little taster of Half Life; tried it on hard mode and won!
5181,"One of the most inspiring, most enlightening games of it's time. After finishing this game for the first time, I had to go back and play it several more times. In fact, I replayed this over 70 times and I still wasn't able to fully soak the story of the lone fisherman and his quest to help the protagonist Grodan Friedman and his trusty companion, the crowbar. I spent many hours up at night just trying to fathom what exactly went through the mind of Friedman as he traversed through the barren landscape of Highway 17. Don't even get me started on how much the High Dynamic Range adds to the whole game. Seriously. I mean, you couldn't get anymore detail and lighting even if you went outside, took a rocket to the surface of the sun, and stood there even though you'd be burning up. Overall, I give this game 8.76 times the square root of pi out of ten. Plus, you get more Garry's Mod Props. Awesome, right?"
5182,"A small Test Game, for what the Source Engine can do. Fund, but not a game at all ^^"
5183,It's really short and pointless!
5184,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is more of a benchmark then a game, Try it to see how fancy the Half-Life 2 engine really can be."
5185,"A happy little game, finally I can use the fisherman in Garry's Mod and I didn't expect this to be in the orange box."
5186,Short but sweet -- a really fun DLC mission.
5187,"Test level, do not buy."
5188,"It was basically a short mission containing new graphics and explaining whatever. I honestly thought I was going to be exploring the lighthouse and town, which would hopefully take hours. I was disappointed when I found out you can do this under 15-40 min. The graphics were good though. I recommend this if you want to see a new type of graphics or whatever. But people, IT IS NOT A GAME."
5189,"My god i love this game. somthing about going into a base, killing enemys, and destroying the boss, super computer, bomb, ect, i love. guess thats why i love the house of the dead series so much... and considering this comes with half life 2 for free. this game is more then worth your time. 9/10"
5190,The fisherman is a pretty cool guy.
5191,"This was just some kind of demo of higher resolution models, I think.  It's just a level with a lighthouse and I don't even think there are any enemies.  Not really a game.  It came with Orange Box.

Pwninator score: n/a"
5192,"Most amazing price for gameplay value. It feels like GTA V crossed with Blowjob. Rednifty gave it a ""I wont host a hide 'n' seek lobby for this game"" out of 10."
5193,Need this for Garrys Mod.
5194,"Really cool look into the development process. Short, but worth a try."
5195,DONT BUY! IF YOU BUY ALL HALF LIFE GAMES THAN YOU GET THIS FREE!
5196,Didn’t this cost like $46 at one point?
5197,"Nothing big at all, just an small island, with only one objective. Comes however as free in orange box."
5198,I thought it was an entire new game. so I was pretty diapointed haha
5199,You get this free with any Source game and it's definitely free I finished it on Hard difficulty in less then an hour but it has some excellent level design
5200,another unseen story in Half-Life 2
5201,"Take it as a side showoff mission, worth it !"
5202,Don't forget about.
5203,Short but Good
5204,some one said
5205,"Half-life 2: lost coast is an expansion to Half-life 2 that is a side story at one point in the game. Lost coast is by far the shortest Half-life expansion to date, a 15 minute game overall. The good part is when you buy Half-life 2 it comes with this game, So if you want to play a Half-life expanion and have beaten Half-life 2, Check out Episode 1 & 2, This expansion comes free when you buy Half-life 2."
5206,neat missing piece in the half life series
5207,Игра полная ХЕРНЯ
5208,I really like the voice of Gaben! Approve this game!
5209,"Short and sweet. Its free, get it if you have HL2. Fun for the 15 minutes it takes up."
5210,Pretty simple took me 10-15 minutes to get through the commentary was intresting and welp its HL2 ._.
5211,"sehr kurzes aber kostenloses Zusatzlevel für Half-Life 2
3/5"
5212,GRETEST GAME IN WORLD U DO SO MUCH
5213,"Even though it is only an experiment of HDR, it was a great way to spend 15min-1/2hr ish (with commentary).  It also includes a stress-test for hl2 related physics."
5214,A little demo to show off the Source Engine. Took an hour to complete.
5215,Really short but a nice experience in half life universe.
5216,This is a really fun game; I beat it in like 30 minutes.
5217,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a short map placed in the Half-Life universe. Even though it got cut from the final game, it still offers a good short story, like a small chapter of Gordon's journey.

The graphics are stunning, making full use of the Source engine's HDR, and the map design is really good as well. The final moments give a true sense of the ""calm before the storm"".

Highly recommendable, and, in fact, I'd suggest you, imaginary gamer reading this review, to play it every time you feel like replaying the HL franchise. In my personal canon, the events of this game actually take place between the events of Half-Life 2 and Episode One, while Gordon is supposedly beneath all that rubble."
5218,"It's a tech demo, not much else."
5219,A Good Tutoral for Half-Life 2. 7/10
5220,it's just ment to be a test for your computer but it is still kind of cool
5221,Это даже не игра. Это демонстрация лучей света (то есть новой графики) в Half-Life 2. Очень короткая миссия.
5222,IF STEAM SAYS I PLAYED THIS GAME...IT MUSTA BEEN SO DAMN FUN I PASSED OUT FROM PURE FUNNESS BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER POOP!!!!...BUY IT NOW!!!!
5223,"This is not actually long enough to be a game, it is more like a presentation of the new graphics that the source engine has used, still i would get it, its fun and pays great homage to the halflife's.
"
5224,"This tests out some new things in the HL2 series. Pretty fun, but really short!"
5225,pointless review
5226,Good little short-cut on describing Half-Life 2 in a nutshell.
5227,This game is for testing your graphics to see how far you can push them till they break.
5228,The old man was too slow.
5229,"Valve had created this game to show off how beautiful you could make stuff with the source engine and my god it worked, Just like most games made in source it aged amazingly and it's pretty short but that doesn't affect the amount of fun you'll have while it lasts."
5230,"Best use of my money EVER! Definitely worth the time to play through this nearly 40 hour long game. Thats right this will keep you playing till then and then some, with its open world action. MUST BUY!!!"
5231,Don't waste money on this. *
5232,"This game was good overall, but it lacked content."
5233,"Lost Coast is a short showcase of the new power of the Source Engine after its upgrade in FY 2006. It introduces High Dynamic Range lighting and features a chapter which was cut from Half-Life 2, which takes place immediately after Highway 17. It only lasts a few minutes of gameplay, but it's worth playing right after you finished Half-Life 2."
5234,"Half-Life 2 lost coast is really just Half-Life 2 bonus content, there is no difference in gameplay or enimies or anything in it."
5235,How is this $40? It's a 30 minute tech demo...
5236,"Just a very, very short episode of a stage not released in the Half-Life 2 game. Nothing much...just like an ""extra feature."" :P"
5237,"This isn't a game, but I had to look up a guide to beat it."
5238,"short, but god it's good"
5239,"how original
"
5240,"I play this when I got HL2 when it released and it was free.....dunno why they decided to charge for this, its a fun map,but no way would I pay even $2.50 for it."
5241,"I believe this ""game"" should have been one of the missions in the original HL2.  Expect to be done in 30 min or less..."
5242,THIS IS THE FUCKING BOMB THIS IS BETTER THEN ALL THE OTHER HALF-LIFE GAMES PUT TOGATHER! NO OTHER GAME BEATS IT!!!!!!!
5243,"Too short, but as stated before, It's to showcase the HDR capabilities of the Source engine."
5244,I found the coast. Game is easy. [spoiler]Why is the fisherman not corralled into a City like all the other humans?[/spoiler]
5245,Nova Scotia?
5246,"Graphics demo that's 8 years old. Sooomehow it's not so impressive today.

So no, not worth the €37 that Steam says it costs.

(Steam really wasn't set up to handle bundle-only games. Heh.)"
5247,"Lost Coast is a level originally planned for the proper Half-Life 2 release, but was left on the cutting room floor. It was revived as a technology showcase and released to owners of HL2 for free. That said you get a snippet of the proper game's world, but nothing that really moves the plot forward. With that in mind, I do think it is really cool that Valve gave us a small peek behind the scenes, and I definitely would like to see more of this kind of content from other developers."
5248,cool game short but you may like it i do
5249,"This is a good non-spukgargleweewee games, only about ten minuetes but it is a tech demo, not worth the $40 but i got with hl2, if it goes to that, it is a good game."
5250,"This is the best Half Life game ever made.
"
5251,it was ight but my cumputer couldnt handle it
5252,Interesting little program. Previewing the game engine and the programmers giving their views on the game
5253,reallty really pointless tbh unless you want to learn about the source engine and see what a great lvl they didn't put into HL2
5254,"Half Life 2, but small
It barely couts as a game
But it's free, who cares"
5255,Great Game bros it is like a Half Life 2 Early Beta or something i really think this game is worth it get it bros!!
5256,Every DLC these guys made were just as EPIC as the base game HL2. Viva Valve and steam!
5257,Yes.
5258,"This isn't really even a game, more of just an experiment in finding if developer commentary is an appealing service to consumers. It is and I sure think so. Developer commentary is like a time-capsule full of the inner workings of game creation. I'm down!"
5259,When this was released the graphics were awesome!
5260,"You may be noticing a pattern in Valve's stable of releases. Yes, even the finest companies can fall Prey 2 [ ;) ] sequelitis! Unforunately for the nerds out there, Half-Life 2 is one of the saddest excuses for a sequel since the announcement that GTA5 would have multiple protaganists. Half-Life 2 takes place in a dreary and sad version of Europe, something like Russia or something, and it really doesn't do much with the world it is set in. The Combine are these masked bad guys whose motivations are never really made clear, and don't even get me started on the zombies. What sense does a zombie make! There are enough zombie games coming from companies who KNOW HOW TO DO THEM, so I don't know why they keep showing up in my Half-Life games.

The weapons are good and sound effects-wise, the game scores high on the board. Zap! Bang! Zap! The classics are all here. The music is also okay, but with no option for a user soundtrack, I'm a little miffed. This game could be a classic with a little more polish, but frankly personally I think not even that would save it from the mediocrity of the rest of the package. There isn't even an option for 3D gaming. You'd think Valve would care more about future-proofing their titles. I sure wish they would."
5261,cool...
5262,Really fun and suprisingly scary (jumpscares and headcrabs). Beautiful coast line. Definitely don't ignore this addition.
5263,"3/5. Part benchmark, part quick FPS. Ok for free."
5264,"The longest entry in the Half-Life series is also the most satisfying. 
10/10"
5265,"Прикольная интерактивная экскурсия, по греческому монастырю, не добавленому в Half Life 2, демонстрирующая эффект HDR. Только здесь можно почувствовать себя суперменом, не используя консоль, а также умереть упав с обрыва или от укуса пиявок зайдя в воду :), проходится минут за 20-30."
5266,"This game is but simply a deleted part of HL2. This game comes with Half-Life 2 so don't get any ideas, like getting it just for this; the average time to beat is 10-30 minutes, and has no storyline or plot whatsoever. This is still pretty fun though."
5267,guys i found the coast. it was behind the couch this whole time
5268,"this aint no game curse you gay ben
never gonna let my uncle gay ben make my rice nuh uh"
5269,Too expensive for it's age.
5270,"Very very short. Takes like 15 minutes to complete. But, it's interesting i guess... There's also some commentary.... Yeah..."
5271,It is only a small part of HL2 to test HDR technology. Enjoyed.. 90/100
5272,"ci dovete giocare,è stra ficoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"
5273,всего одна миссия в этой игре но зато какая!!!

5276,Okay
5277,"Cut content? Oh boi.

5280,밸브의 엔진 시연용 기술 게임인데 상당히 소스 2004 엔진을 가지고 HDR지원 해서 소스 2007 엔진 으로 보이게 한 게 대단하다.
5281,tech demo for the leeches. You get to listen to Valve audio commentaries which are always hilarious 5 or so years after the game's initial release.
5282,ok
5283,This was born to show off HDR lighting on the source engine.
5284,"This was a show of VALVE's technical prowess back when they sat upon the throne as the king of the gaming industry. It really illustrates VALVE's capabilities. And I salivate at the tought of another Half-Life. It's been almost 9 years, VALVE. You know what to do."
5285,Longest game ever
5286,"Well...this was just meant to showcase the newest Source Engine features, with a bit of gameplay slapped on.

Nothing much to say really!"
5287,"It's a guided tour through some lost HL2 level where you listen to some commentary from the developers explaining a bunch of interesting stuff about the Source Engine and Half-Life. It is not a game though, it's a short walking simulator that may or may not contain the release data for HL3 and may or may not reveal the identity of the G-Man.

Beeshu - January 2013"
5288,Waste of space.  10/10
5289,best 16 hours of my life
5290,"Actually a rather intresting look at what goes into these games. If you're intrested in the technical side of HL2, it's worth a look."
5291,Best Game Ever.
5292,Valve cuts content from their game and then releases it again: make your mind up guys.
5293, bmncmnh
5294,"Now, I don't know if this game is free now or not, but when I last checked it was priced at £50, that is a very high price for a tec demo.

This is very short and offers hardly any enjoyment. The only reason I even own this is because of a special sign up promotion a few years ago.

Don't buy this."
5295,source engine 2004 to the orange box engine

5297,Just a test.
5298,ПИС ОФ ЩИТ
5299,"Well, I got this as an extra package after buying Counter-Strike: Source; along with Half-Life: Deathmatch.  It's very short, but it was fun while it lasted, I suppose."
5300,For Half-Life lovers. <3
5301,more of a test for the hdr
5302,"Half-Life 2 Lost Coast is a tech demo to show of Source's HDR lighting and it uses a level that was removed from the Half-Life 2 campaign.

As you travel through this level you encounter various objects and sceneries that come with a little narrated explanation from Gabe Newell and his goons.

It's a tech demo, and not a very good one at that. If you want to test your system, go get 3DMark. If you want to learn about the making of Half-Life 2, go google it. And if you want to hear Gabe Newell's voice I am sure there are places that can help you with that too, also you might need to see a medical professional about that."
5303,Short simple fun expansion that really shows off the source engine.
5304,"Takes place at some point right in the middle of Half-Life 2, so that's when I played it.  I think I beat the entire thing in about 30 minutes.  It's no so much it's own game as it is a standalone level.  Definitely worth playing if you're already into the Half-Life games, especially Half-Life 2."
5305,"More of a tech demo than a game, but it is still a nice experience. =)"
5306,nice little game
5307,Interesting....Yet fun
5308,Part of the finest video game series ever made. Overall Score: 5/5

5320,"Half-Life 2: Lost Coast to darmowy dodatek do gry Half-Life 2 wydany 27 października 2005. Jest to krótki poziom, zawierający tylko jedną mapę, którego głównym celem jest prezentacja nowego efektu zaimplementowanego do silnika Source - HDRa. Głównym obiektem na mapie jest klasztor Św. Olgi położony na szczycie wysokiego klifu, oraz przylegające do niego budynki. Lokacja ta miała być pierwotnie wykorzystana w Half-Life 2, gdzieś pomiędzy rozdziałami Highway 17, a Ruchome Piaski. Gracz budzi się u podnóża klifu, gdzie spotyka Rybaka. Ten wyjaśnia mu, że Kombinat wykorzystuje klasztor Św. Olgi jaką swoją bazę, w której znajduje się wyrzutnia kapsuł z headcrabami.

5321,Best.. Tech Demo.. Evar.
5322,"Free, Fun, Short.  Valve created it to test/demonstrate what they were doing with their engine changes between HL:2 and Episode 1.  While not even related to the main story, its still an interesting playthrough that doesn't leave you feeling like you wasted your time.  Contains a tiny bit of lore, and a lot of covenant stomping."
5323,"This game sucks, its really just an game where Valve showing off its new graphic HDR thing but otherwise there not much story to it making it a waste of space on your computer."
5324,"Umm, i cant find the game anywhere in my library."
5325,This is basically a short playable tech demo.
5326,"I got this free for having a ATI Graphics card, Fun Little Adventure
Bonus points if you can use the broken boat to swim to the other side of the town.

"
5327,This is a tech demo of sorts to show off new gaming technology (at the time). It's short. There's boats and a fisherman and then some stuff happens but it's all easily forgettable. Apparently there are no fish in whatever dystopian future the Half-Life universe is set in. They've been wiped out and replaced with eels. Sounds about right. Yeah.

5335,you can do it
5336,F-ck this sad piece shit.
5337,"This is clearly a master piece.  It is not very often when I play a game with this much potential.  This game  - No. This marvelous peice of art suprasses all other well known simulation games like Battle Toads, Imagine Party Babyz or Madden.  If you haven't already, I highly suggest buying this product."
5338,"Its a demo. Has nothing to do with the actual Half-Life 2 game outside of showing you some mechanics. 

The actual HL2 is cheap and amazing get that don't bother installing this."
5339,Recomendo
5340,wtf is this shit
5341,"Revolutionized gameplay, has better graphics than halo, and hours of gameplay experience"
5342,Only buy if you $99 version. It comes with extras like Freeman's voice and Alyx naked
5343,ㅇㄻㅈㄹ
5344,Meh.
5345,"A missing Half Life 2 Lever, with some epecial rendering effects thrown it. Cool to look at."
5346,its like half life 2's midget retarded little brother
5347,"The adventures of the mighty scie..sailor Gordon Fishman, and how he tried to save Riverholm from the crabs!
This game is in my list of classics. :)

"
5348,"A deleted level from HL2. Its free, so its hard to complain"
5349,bisschen kurz :D
5350,40 bucks for boat smashin'. Well worth the money.
5351,This is a good demo to test graphics and new gameplay and stuff but they really shouldn't do this to us people that like half life because it's like torture having to wait for the next one!  This is basically a test to see how they can improve the game.  It's exactly like half life 2 but better.  It's one of my favorites if they come out with the whole game.
5352,hl2 lost coast 2 is gonna come up before hl3.
5353,"This is a very great short Half Life 2 story. Very interactive. Just don't like how short it is, but it has a fisherman!"
5354,N/N - Can't rate this. Good free demo with beautiful scenery. And I have listened to all the developer commentary.
5355,holy shit this cost money!!!!
5356,"Fun for a tutorial and/or teaser of the game, very replayable. The perfect taste as to what the game is about, especially since it's free."
5357,이 게임 자체를 평가하는것보다 게이브의 말을 듣는게 더 재미있겠는데?
5358,"The design of the game is just amazing. And if you think it could not get any better the story begins. Your able to steer your story with control. Feel the world the way your character would feel it. And find out how not only you but the world that surrounds you evolves, and use your influence to change the way the world works. The music of LOST COAST is astonishing and intense. The music was my refuge.  I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness."
5359,"What an awesome game! It has commentary from the developers as you play. The developers commentate about how they used HDR to really draw the player into the game. Its amazing to know how much detail and time got put into the game. The shooting was basic for a casual shooter. The developers at Valve wants you to give feedback to how this game looks and feel to the player. The game takes about 10 mins to beat the first time through. I beat it a couple times to really enjoy the games graphics and art style. This is a great game to have in your collection, it opens up your mid to new possibilities and if you want to know more of what it takes to get a game looking and playing the way it does then this is the game for you. It is a very interesting game and I highly recommend it."
5360,Alt title: Gabe Newell's Private Island Resort 4
5361,This is just a Half Life 2 ~ Engine test map with comments from the devs.
5362,"I was a little lost at first, but then I killed everyone."
5363,"Basically a tech demo for HL2. I personally love it and play through it about once a year. It's short and sweet. It's a good way to decide if you're going to like HL2. No story at all, but the controls and shootiness are all there."
5364," It's very short. I feel like $60 wasn't worth 30 minutes of gameplay. Not only that, but the whole time, there are these stupid dialogue boxes where the developers developers developers developers ramble on and on about the game...very frustrating. DO NOT BUY"
5365,FRIED MY COMP. BIG VIRUS DO NOT PLAY.
5366,GUYS I FIGURE OUT THE SECRET. THIS WAS EPISODE 3 ALL ALONG.
5367,"Nothing really to do with the story. But hey, it's still half-life."
5368,Nice. Should be in vanilla hl2.
5369,A nice demo of half life 2 before you buy the game the graphics are pretty top notch too
5370,I don't know where I got this...
5371,I'm recommending this as a game for the usual HL:2 formula it rolls out but LC is the BEST way to check out what your pretty pound of hardware can do! Play it with commentary enabled to get the full experience.
5372,"This game was a test of the power of the Source engine- a test it passes with its beautiful high dynamic range. The game itself was a segment cut from the ""Highway Seventeen"" chapter of Half-Life 2. It plays like a Half-Life game and doesn't disappoint in that aspect. In fact, I wish this weren't removed from the full game, as it would have made a great addition. However, as a standalone game, aside from Half-Life's tried and true gameplay, it's a graphics testing mat with a thirty dollar pricetag. I cannot recommend this game for that reason."
5373,"0.0
"
5374,"lolwut
where did this come from"
5375,So Cheap!!!!
5376,Play Play
5377,"Idk what this game is for, cuz i never played it."
5378,fuck this game
5379,"This is a small segment that never got included in the main game but it's beautiful and easily playable even if you never play any other Halflife game.  I recomend it if you have any interest in learning the sort of game design decisions that go into making a 3D FPS.  The gameplay in this is nothing that unusual, but after you've played it, then try going back and listening to the 14 bits of directors commentary.  Beautiful environment and interesting details about how a game is planned."
5380,"Nie wiem o co chodzi, ale pedały biegają po ścianach ,a ja z nich ich zrzucam Haha ; D"
5381,should be worth 10000 dollars for being best evrya goty
5382,Good Game but should have achievements
5383,When is EP3 comming?
5384,eeepic
5385,Is Shiny
5386,This came with the purchase of the orange box and was a nifty little 5 minute demo of what's to come for the half life series.
5387,"Play the game, or just run the video test. Or, if you're a weirdo like me, paint a wall with the gravity gun. You'll figure it out once you get there..."
5388,이거 상점에서 파는데 산새낀 없지? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
5389,"This game ate my day for nothing, Good thing I got a nVidia Graphics card so I got it for free."
5390,hours of gameplay
5391,"I really like the game, but I couldn’t find the stupid cake.
"
5392,An inllustration of new source engine. Funny
5393,"The best of all the Half-Life games, I can't recommend it enough!  Plus, the price is right!"
5394,OMG_WTF_this game is the be-all of demos!!!
5395,Tech Demonstration. You don't need to download this. It will just takes up space on your hard drive.
5396,Bla bla bla.
5397,pas⁣ka peli
5398,It's like a short Half-Life 2. Very demo-like.
5399,"A HDR lighting demo.
Ummm... doesn't contribute much at all."
5400,Hate it.
5401,I GOT THIS FREE SOMEHOW LOLOLOLOLOL
5402,8.0
5403,"Worth a look if you're fascinated by the HDR graphics filters. This was created as a lighting test/game test level, and is really only for the die hard HL2 completists.
(What happens here didn't factor into the HL2 plot at all.)"
5404,how did i get this game
5405,15 гребаных минут
5406,"An interesting graphics demonstration that effectively amounts to a side chapter of Half Life 2. It's easy to complete in roughly 20 minutes and does include a decent climax battle, though quite small in both drama and scope compared to Half Life 2 proper or the Episodes. Nice to try if you enjoy the Half Life series, but it doesn't add anything new to the overall story, simply showcases some visual enhancements prior to the more extensive revisions made for Episodes 1 and 2."
5407,Best Half-Life game so far! 10/10 would play again
5408,"Best tech demo ever 2: Lost Coast. Best hero ever 2: Lost Coast. Best story ever 2: Lost Coast. Best boss ever 2: Lost Coast--depending on how you look at bosses. Still no sign of Xen ever 2: Lost Coast(but some weird part came scarily close).
"
5409,"The best test map for HL2 and the first game I ever saw with commentary. I always meant to play Portal with commentary, but I never did. I wonder if the HL2 episodes have commentary. It was neat in the Lost Coast though."
5410,This is an interesting tech demo and if you have it I'd give it a play through once but I wouldn't go out of my way to acquire a copy.
5411,"(: i like it but it 30 mins long but i was not cheating on it
"
5412,"After several hours of overnight grinding, I had realized Lost Coast was probably one of the best Half Life games I have ever played. Its intense amount of depth, and unforgetttable characters like that one guy you meet on the dock, will leave you both inspired and moved."
5413,"You know for an old tech demo, the bloom is much better than any game in 2011."
5414,A beautiful introduction to the source engine.  Even if you have played games on the source engine already but haven't gone the distance in Lost Coast...  You're missing out.
5415,more like half-life 2: episode 0.5
5416,"A tech demo. It shows us some unused content originally developed for Half-Life 2, but was cut. Story wise it gives us some insight as to where the headcrab canisters come from, and more about the residents of the coast."
5417,gabe newell's author insertion fanfic
5418,This is not even a game! I actually mistook it for episode 3. I know right!
5419,:|
5420,"Interesting mission, is strange that is not in the main game."
5421,"In this Lost Coast, you find a lost coast, and then it's over, like a bad Hallmark movie. It's... a thing that exists."
5422,"Free, and it looks beautiful!"
5423,"It's like a small segment of HL2, maybe 20 minutes long,  No official plot but If the story is important you can imagine it''s Gordon's fucking dream or some shit.  Still plays like HL2."
5424,"Highly suggest picking it up just for a play thru, the story is well worth it!"
5425,I was going to review this game... but I lost it...
5426,I FOUND IT!
5427,Still beautiful...
5428,"A sort of deleted chapter made DLC graphics/physics game. It's only included in the Valve Complete Bundle, and is under 30 minutes long. However, it does look nice and plays well. The most diehard Half Life fans may feel dissapointed at what this brings to the table, but its not trying to be a game in itself, just a showcase of what the Source engine is capable of."
5429,"Lost Coast eh? Well as far as my memory serves me this game was meant to be a test for some new HD and Bloom/Depth of View stuff options for the Source Engine. There isn't much to this 'game' itself as you'll be over and done with it in less than 3 hours or something but hey, it's fun. I think you get it free with HL2 or something as well... not sure. Anyhow, nothing much to review. Think of this as some test demo but it's worth playing it as one of the main NPC's who will help you has the same voice as Bill from Left 4 Dead... well... because it is the same voice actor. Anyway, meh."
5430,"Игра норм, но слишком коротка 
прошёл за 20 минут"
5431,A fun 30 minute demo of the groundbreaking HDR upgrade introduced in the Source engine back then. And it's free.
5432,It's short but it's still fun too play.
5433,"Really cool short story!!! 
Gordon is by himself, goes to the Lost Coast Island to do a favor. 
I was done (Gordon was done) in a few hours. (Less than a day) 
More seasoned players might do it in 1 or 2 hours..."
5434,"La cosa più inutile a cui abbia mai giocato, dura si e no 1 ora e 10 minuti.

DA AVERE ASSOLUTAMENTE!"
5435,"As a free sidemission that didn't make it into the main game, this is fun lil' campaign in a boots of Dr. Freeman. 9/10"
5436,only $99.99
5437,This game is like a walk around the park.
5438,"love it
"
5439,A demo of how the Half-Life 2 engine works. Ideal if you're not sure how well your machine will handle the graphics.
5440,Guaranteed hours of fun with this - A must buy for any true gamer.
5441,"That's is a so good game. Is Aproved!
Esse é um jogo muito bom. Aprovado!"
5442,"This is a tech demo. Don't pay $60 for this. It's fun to play, but it only takes 20 minutes or so to complete. Only get this if it comes with something else."
5443,it's not lost it's right there guys gosh
5444,?
5445,why is it even possible to write a recommendation for this
5446,Hands down the best game in the Half-Life franchise.
5447,Nice graphical demonstration
5448,"The coast is a nice place to hang out, the sand, the land, the sea, there's something for everyone! What better way to place a developer map than here eh?"
5449,Not really a game. This was a sandbox for Valve to show off some newer video card features and gaming concepts. All those features are now standard and expected.
5450,"it's a must have if you own half life 2 ep 1 and ep 2
"
5451,"Una buena forma de conocer el motor Source si no tienen dinero, lo pueden obtener gratis desde acá:

ATi

http://steampowered.com/ati_offer1a/

Nvidia:

http://steampowered.com/nvidia/"
5452,The best half life.  EVER.
5453,"Considering that there are only two ways to get this single-level game worth a maximum of an hours gameplay, those being through the Steam NVIDIA offer, and buying the Valve Complete Pack, you could think of this game as a collectible. This game is a level which was ripped out of Half-Life 2 due to it being unnecessary to the storyline."
5454,"mega nice men kun en mission
funny game but only one mission"
5455,"It's hard to imagine any gaming company making a tech demo playable, let alone challenging. You can imagine how this level would have fit nicely between the driving sections in [i]Half-Life 2[/i]. As a standalone game, it's short but sweet."
5456,"Strangely enough, this is one of my absolute favourite Half Life maps."
5457,"Very short, if you got some 10 min of waiting for someone, play this to waste that 10 mins if you want, this game is very short."
5458,"Very interesting game. (Free as well) First time I played Half-Life and the visuals are... you can't say 'really good' as in 'Crysis-level' graphics, but it's... quite a step up from the old arcadey-blocky Quake-style graphics. Realistic? Definitely."
5459,"A free addition to owners of Half-Life 2: The Lost Coast is more of a hardware test and interactive commentary rather than a game (or a mod, for that matter).
Not much I can say about it really. It's common knowledge that the Lost Coast is actually a level cut from the original iteration of HL2 set to take place between the ""Highway 17"" and ""Sandtraps"" levels. But if you have Half-Life 2, take a look at it. Play through both the actual level and the commentary and you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Plus, hey! Free Gmod content, whats not to like?"
5460,"This was the single best $100 I have ever spent. I've gotten in over 300 hours of gameplay on this bad boy, and it was easily the best time I've had in my life. If they had even charged twice this amount, I urge you all to purchase it."
5461,dont waste money on this
5462,Half Life 2: Lost Coats is a game where you fight aliens who've stolen your coats.
5463,"This game is about the radio show Coast to Coast AM.  Originally titled Coast to Coast to Coast AM, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast explains what happened to the controversial third coast.  Not for minors."
5464,a good vidoe game with fisherman
5465,"short tech demo ofcourse. but pretty fun, nice to hear the dev comentary. shame its not longer or allows you to head over to the townside."
5466,"It's free. What else do you need?
"
5467,Do you like tech demos from several years ago? Do you like commentary nodes? Do you like zero loading screens during gameplay?
5468,"EPIC graphics. All i have to say XD, One of the first games i got in a steam Promo. This would have to be anoher reason why i went into the HL universe i know today XD. Nevertheless This game totally was min-boggling it served to me as a demo merely because its super short and because it's only for testing purposes only since this game was mainly intended as a graphics test. Cutting to the chase here: this was definetly intense when i first started playing (Don't be scared though!) But once you get the hang of it. It'll be an ok FPS/Adventure :P

8.11/10 :P

GL & HF...."
5469,How the f**k did I spend five hours on that?
5470,This is how technical showcases should be done.
5471,insane graphics learn how Valve makes your games look so great. Valve is king!
5472,Very very short bonus map. Not worth of downloading.
5473,КОРОТКАЯ ОЧЕНЬ
5474,was good at it time but not anymore need more ppl to play it to be fun.
5475,"In all likelyhood you own this, so the question becomes ""why the hell not?"""
5476,짧고 굵은 멋진스토리!
5477,tech demo. This game is totally worth...15 minutes..
5478,"Best installment of the Half-Life series, worth every penny of the $99.99"
5479,a small but meaningful extension to the half-life games
5480,"It's free with Half-Life 2, play it."
5481,IIIIMMMMM   BLLLIIINNNNDDDDD!!!!!!!!
5482,клёвая игра жалко что быстро кончается
5483,"не, это хуйня"
5484,This is what Fallout 3 should have been.
5485,Do not PLAY!
5486,"It's just a tech demo, but it sure is a nice one."
5487,"Wish they made more like this, small samples of Half Life 2 that could fit into the real game."
5488,Isn't this game free? Last time I check this game was free to download.
5489,"Just a small bonus level for Half Life 2. Could have done with more content.... always more content. Valve are too busy with their rumored inefficient corporate unstructure communist thing and milking their bloated cash cow of Steam to give us sequels to their mascot series.

9 / 12"
5490,"A small tech demo to show off HDR and some other new (at the time) to the Source Engine effects. However, its still a fun little selection to play and Saint Olga is gorgeously created. I'd love a chance to explore the town further."
5491,A playable technology showcase?! Count me the fuck in!!!!
5492,Best 50€ I ever spent!
5493,"Già, bel livello, da giocare!"
5494,"A very small custom-built level for HL2 fans.
Nice and simple.
Nothing really special, but a piece that a half-life-collection shouldn't be missing.."
5495,"Lost Coast is like a demo for Half Life 2 Episode 2 I dont know why the even give this ""game"" a spot in your library."
5496,"This is like a Half Life 2 expanision. Except its a chapter probably cut from the game.

Pros
- Half Life
- Source engine which is better than the one in Half Life 2
- Dynamic water reflections
- amazing graphics for a 2005 game.
- The Cathedral setting gave a european environment looking real

Cons
- Kind of hard to play


This comes with HL2, so its not a decision of buying it, its a decision of downloading it and playing it. You should play this, its a nice touch in the series."
5497,un solo capitolo :( :*(
5498,ending scene for hl2
5499,"I found it, you guys. It's on my hard drive. You want it back? You can have a copy, but I'm keeping the original here. You know how in movies when the bad guys download a file they always delete the original? That makes no sense. Some dude is going to show up to work the next morning and people are going to have been sending him problem tickets related to a missing, vital file all night. The guy is going to realize very quickly that someone has deleted his file. Then he'll just restore a backup and tell his manager that someone stole the file. A few hours of bureaucracy later the police, FBI, CIA, RCMP, Interpol and Anonymous will be on the case, destroy the shit out of that dumbass hacker. He should have just left the fucking original file where it was. This is why the movie industry needs IT professionals like me to tell them that they are retarded. Because they are. Some shows are better about science, though, like Star Trek The Next Generation and Star Gate. Tau'ri represent!"
5500,"The plot and detail of the world around you will envelope you in depth and richness like youv'e never seen before. Prepare to be blown away by state-of-the-art graphics and AI. The whole thing is one big masterpiece of a game. By the time you get to level 20 and have the best perks, the Enclave will crumble at the sight of you. Grab a tesla cannon and melt some commies!"
5501,This is the greatest installment in the Half-Life series yet. Valve should cancel Episode Three and just work on Lost Coast 2.
5502,"I recommend Half Life 2 The Lost Coast to everyone that likes action and old fishermen which this game has alot of. 
Its a truely gripping game that will have you on the edge of your seat for half an hour. Enjoy!!"
5503,"You should get this with Half-Life 2, but in case you don't - do not buy it, because it's totally not worth the purchase. It's only a side map (1 level), but it's cool to play."
5504,"This is nice and atmospheric piece, If you didnt play this. you missed nice part of HL story."
5505,"Truly mindblowing, with a driving narrative that made the 13 hours it took me to complete it fly past all too swiftly."
5506,"This is more of a demo than a game. You barely get to do anything. If you must, download it, play it for the 30 minutes, then delete it."
5507,Best game in the Half-life series by far.
5508,More like I spent half of my life being lost at the coast.... 2
5509,"You should definitely check this game out if you have the time. It's essentially a demo test area of Half-Life 2, and it's packed full of developer commentaries and content."
5510,"Its Free with any HL2 game, i think. This was pretty much a tech demo for HDR on Source. but is pretty good for a single level. 

7/10"
5511,Very Short. it's about 30 minutes of game play.  I wouldn't buy it unless it's included in a pack.
5512,i will blow u away
5513,"While not an actual game in itself, Lost Coast originally started as one of the intended levels to be included in Half-Life 2, but their designs took another path and this level would have been left by the wayside. Instead, they creative repurposed this map to showcase various elements of the Source Engine and the technology and effects it can support. Various comment bubbles are strewn about to allow you to selectively listen to, and in many cases view, commentary related to a particular aspect or visual. Not a game, but an interesting and interactive documentary that will allow you to learn more about the engine and their mentality when designing many of the maps and environments of the game. Give it a try at least once, seriously."
5514,"""arguably the best in the series. hours of entertainment."""
5515,It's only a demo.
5516,Gimmicky single level add on to Half Life 2. At least it's free.
5517,I'm stuck on the broken boat puzzle someone help :(
