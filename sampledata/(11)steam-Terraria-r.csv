5,"Played the game for about a week with some friends and had quite a bit of fun with it, but then the game randomly stopped letting me connect to worlds and shortly after stopped launching. I tried restarting my computer and it didn't work. Whenever I try to launch the game, it just shows a white screen for a couple seconds and then closes, and nothing I can do will fix it."

75,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
76,"Great game, family friendly building and fighting game.

Fun dungeons and bosses, need to farm and build up gear to progress.

91,"Progression very fun. First time that I've played a game that involved constantly looking at the wiki so much and actually enjoyed it. With every new weapon you're just left wondering ""Whats the next cool weapon / armor I can get?"". Every stage of the game has interesting weapons and enemies to fight. Great game would play again as a different class."

108,"This game has good progression without it all being forced, plenty of different choices depending on how you want to play. Also allows you to build and express yourself well"
109,t√§√§ on peli
110,"After giving this game another shot I began to recognize the undertones and direct references from other fantasy based nostalgia. This game has a ton of elements and biomes to explore. You can literally customize and build to your hearts content while fighting off droves of the undying, unyielding and unwavering forces within the world of Terraria. If you want a side scroller, plat-former, that has dungeons and dragons based game play with a lighthearted twist then look no further. 5/5 for Creativity, 10/10 for Game play and design."
111,"fun hard

135,"comparable to minecraft atleast, it not it is even better."
136,"I feel like I've barely seen what this game has to offer. I've fought the Eye of Cthulhu once on a natural spawn completely by accident. It's great fun to just explore the world, meet the NPC's, and build beautiful wooden boxes to hide in."
137,Connor <3
138,fun game
139,Amazing
140,never got past hard mode tbh
141,.
142,"Terraria is unironically the best use of 10 dollars on steam, you will get thousands of hours of fun, just look at me! I've got almost 1700 hours as of now on this game, and that's just on PC, I probably rack up a good 3000 in total throughout all of my adventures in this game. 

I won't spoil much about the game, but if you like, exploring, fighting, building, and becoming stronger by the second, Terraria is the game for you. It comes with many difficulty options ranging from a casual and relaxing experience to a challenge that makes Elden Ring look like baby's first game.

Oh and also everything in this game is a pop culture reference, and that's cool as hell.

Buy this game.

- Lady Drackie"
143,fun

161,boobs mod
162,It's fun. High replay value.
163,"I will always love this game for reasons that don't likely need said. I mean look at the other 14 quadrillion positive reviews, however I do have to doc the game points for making me waste time quarantining the crimson in pre-hardmode only for a 4 screen wide diagonal strip of crimsoned area to spawn directly under my house all the way from the surface to the underworld as soon as I beat the wall of flesh. Life is pain."

217,"
I like to play this game when i get home from school with my friends. NOTE When you start don't look up a tutorial try it your self first. 11/10 GREAT game! It's worth the $25. Have a great time with this game!"

223,its saying could not find buff image asset pls help
224,yeah i mean its ok i guess
225,"the combat has more complexity than ""walk up to the thing and beat it until it dies"" and that terrifies me"
226,"This game is truly amazing. From the music, to the different biomes, to weapons and more. I cannot even put into words how happy I was when I played with my friends on Terraria for the first time. And even to this day, I still play Terraria often. If you have enough money, I seriously reccommend this game."
227,"Was a bit sceptical about all the hype surrounding this game but I have to say that it is easily one of the best games I have played. The default experience has dozens of ways you can play through it and the modded experience adds a whole new level to the game. I had easily sunk 100 hours on this game without even noticing it due to all the fun I was having. The music is phenomenal, atmosphere is amazing and everything else is perfectly done. 100% recommend getting this game and I still cant believe that this game is this cheap for the level it. I would go as far to say that the level of enjoyment and fun you get from this game is on par, if not higher, than most triple A games that cost upwards of ¬£60. I've gotten this game over 2-3 years ago and I still have fun whenever I play with friends or by myself. The game is easily a 9.8/10 with updates coming that improve the game further."
228,its good but god please fix the steam multiplayer
229,"This game has had me hooked for countless hours more than what's on my account. I've noticed that my offline time isn't reflected in my online profile here on Steam. Nor can it even know how many hours I've sank into the Switch and Mobile editions. Yes, I own them all!

I am having a particularly odd situation with Terraria on my Steam Deck however. I've been slowly adding various titles to my new favorite gaming computer as I have interest in picking them back up again. I am somebody who does not have home internet. And you'd think that a game as widely playable as Terraria is, wouldn't have problems launching on (yet another) computer that's frequently offline. I'm disappointed to say that, as of right now, no internet means no being able to play on my Steam Deck in Game Mode. This distinction is made for a reason. We Steam Deck owners are fond of our ability to directly access our games in a streamlined fashion right from the default loading screen. For Terraria, however, if I want to play offline, I can do so if I reboot into desktop mode, launch Steam (in offline mode, of course) and then launch Terraria. However, leaving the comfy confines of Game Mode removes much of the joy of Game Mode. The ability to adjust TDP and refresh rates, easily having access to keybinds and much more from the Steam and Elispsis buttons. I'm not sure if this is an easy fix or not, but I look forward to the day that Game Mode works well for this title, offline as well as online."
230,yes
231,exceptional game
232,"Great game, very simple and not too complicated."
233,W Game

239,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what¬†he¬†really¬†is."

243,"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."

321,"If you haven't yet do yourself a favour and play this. Terraria is easily one of the best games you can buy, it offers hundreds of hours of fun alone or with friends. The game has such huge variety in tools, weapons, and blocks that all aspects of the game from the building to the combat never get stale, at this point at least once a year one of the homies will suggest doing a playthrough and we'll all sink a hundred hours and a couple of weeks of our lives into a playthrough, this game is one of the few that I started playing as a kid and continued playing into adulthood, highly recommend! 9/10."

417,I have always wanted to play this game. It worth all the money that I paid for. Really recommended.

420,"Terraria is an interesting game. It can be confusing for beginners just starting the game but an experienced player or someone who watches a few YT vids can have a great time. Terraria is similar to Minecraft in many ways yet wildly different. In minecraft, you have to search and explore to find the bosses but in Terraria you touch one funny looking butterfly and you get screwed. Terraria is much more difficult and offers much more base game content while Minecraft offers a much more dynamic and customized multiplayer experience. Terraria is an excellent game with near endless possibilities."

621,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

644,THIS GAME IS THE REAL DEAL
645,it is fun
646,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
647,Peak Guys.
648,"The game is not enjoyable until you have to spend time on a wiki reading for hours and researching on youtube.
That's not how game design was meant to be. The crafting guide is not enough to teach you everything. Getting the truffle? no hints in the game what so ever to get the achievement. having to look online only ruins the fun.
Guidance for the game shouldn't leave the game window.
For a game that is released from 2011 and haven't addressed this, just baffles me.
Until i got someone to join my gaming session i was just stuck for hours trying to figure out how to progress the game.
I really wanted to like the game, but the fun is sucked out without the most basic and essential element."

842,what? you haven't bought terraia and you're looking in the reviews to see if its good? trust me when i say if you like 8-bit sandbox games you will not regret buying this game its extremely fun. (even better with friends) I wont give any details about the game because its better blind but if you're stuck the wiki will be your best friend. This is some guy with an opinion on a game signing off.
843,the grind don't stop
844,It's embarrassing how many hours of my life I've spent on this game throughout the years. It's one of my favorites ever!
845,"Terraria is an amazing experience, best experienced with a group of friends who are open to exploration and plenty of hardships.

We need more games like this that avoid holding your hand and sets you out on a grand adventure where you just keep discovering more and more. The deeper you get into it, the more the game opens up to you."

852,"I like the building aspect and the challenges that come with combat, there are many different places to explore, and things to collect and craft hours of endless fun! I catch myself losing time to this game on more than one occasion"
853,"There's nothing wrong with this game, its great"
854,
855,It is really fun once you know the basics and know what to do. I recommend going to the Terraria Wiki for some info.
856,I like.
857,Ive only played 3 hours and it's the best game to ever exist.

"
865,"Why wouldn't you play this ultimate experience of a game? At first it seems a bit daunting and trivial....wait until the goblin army arrives from the east. Hopefully, you will have gained enough power to fend them off."
866,its pretty cool
867,"One of the best games I have ever played. Since making my own personal steam account, I have gone through the trouble to beat the game with 100% achievements twice and buying the game again just to give a review. This is a must buy for an amazing price and I can't wait to continue playing some more. Thank you Re-Logic and thank you Redigit for making one the best games to have ever graced the earth. I give this game a 10/10 for an amazing job of being Minecraft while not being Minecraft."
868,"SO SUPER FUN, BUT MAKE SURE TO HAVE SOMEONE TO PLAY WITH >:DD"
869,gay
870,GigaChad
871,"I like this game so much, I always play it with my friends"
872,dont be a bitch. play the game.
873,"Usually, I don't get to far into survival games because i usually get bored. This is a very good exception. It looks incredible and so do the character designs, even the player character, which can actually let use change it inside the game, which is something i really like. as for the game play, its 2D style brings a tad bit of nostalgia while being a completely different game. So much content and this to do is crammed into this game. I highly recommend."
874,very good game also the game has good graphics and very cool music you should play this game!!!!.
875,penis

"
884,"So much content I still have a wiki open on my second monitor after probably 10+ playthroughs, but if that scares you fear not as just messing around and using new stuff will almost always work. Superb game!"
885,"Cool number, the 343 industries number"
886,"Terraria is an amazing game! So much to do, so many enemies, items, biomes, events, it's awesome!"
887,This is the best game ever made. It is better than minecraft and feels less soulless then minecraft it is still being updated has lots of fun mods. Overall a 10/10
888,"A game you can get lost on for hours. Great bounty and bosses make you want to keep exploring for the next best tool, weapon, gear, potion, etc."
889,"Great game got a buddy who cant stop asking to play it
"
890,First game I ever played when I was first introduced to PC. I love this game to death and will never stop playing it to cherish those memories.

906,"It got advertised to me in the minecraft main menu and does not disappoint, just a better version of minecraft"
907,Its got a lot of stuff you can get to make the game funner and a good progress system with bosses of varying diffiulty so you are mostly always challenged when trying to upgrade loot

Everything is very tiny, you can get killed by stepping on a 3 pixel pressure plate you didn't notice in a random cave, and combat feels just bad. The amount of enemies spawning is very bullshit too in general."

1012,"What can I say that hasn't already been said by others? If you don't mind the retro-style SNES-era 2D graphics, and like sandbox games with crafting, exploration, resource gathering, combat, and being able to kill a literal GOD, then this game is for you.

This is absolutely the best value in gaming available. $10 base price, sometimes $2.50 on sale now and then.... It has been out for 10 years, and is STILL getting FREE updates and gameplay improvements. I haven't put over 3K hours into it for nothing - I just keep coming back to it over and over, no matter what other games come out."

1020,"[h1] Um dos melhores jogos do s√©culo! [/h1]

Terraria √© um jogo que tem praticamente tudo! 
Um jogo que te prende do in√≠cio ao ""fim"" (poque tecnicamente n√£o tem fim).
E te prende porque voc√™ sempre tem o que fazer, seja em sandbox fazendo constru√ß√µes, ou para o craft pegando loots, ou melhorando vida e stamina e melhorando equipamentos para conquistar locais e/ou matar boss.
Al√©m de ter uma boa variedade de materiais, blocos.... para construir como quiser. O jogo tamb√©m conta com muitas armas e armaduras, sem falar nos equip√°veis que deixam ainda melhor seu personagem. Tamb√©m possui ""roupinhas"" para que se n√£o quiser se vestir sempre com armaduras, disfar√ßar com as roupas da moda.
Enfim... O jogo tamb√©m possui muitos NPCs e diversos monstros, bosses e animais inofensivos [spoiler] (mas que podem ficar ofensivos em dias especiais) [/spoiler] que v√£o te acompanhar na sua jornada, afinal voc√™ nunca estar√° completamente sozinho.
Por falar em sozinho, o jogo possui o modo multiplayer que eu particularmente recomendo muito, afinal √© sempre melhor jogar com amigos, e neste caso, se quiser at√© fazer alguns duelos PvP e ter v√°rios times para batalhar... Mas gostoso mesmo √© jogar na amizade (pra mim).
E para finalizar falando das conquistas Steam: s√£o muito muito muito legais de fazer e fazem com que voc√™ conhe√ßa todo o jogo 100% de forma divertida (sem precisar de matar para fazer um conquista)

Por fim, vale super a pena comprar, tenho certeza que render√° muitas horas de divers√£o!"
1021,yes
1022,fun
1023,"ive played this game for many years, since i was small. it was always a challenge, it was minecraft but so much more. now that im older and can really get into the nitty gritty, i play on all platforms almost, using a different class and playing differently all the time. this game has alot of replayability, witht he different world spawns and different classes you can build. Even without mods, this game not only offers fond childhood memories, but a whole new world to explore each time. you wont regret it"

gameplay was shit, bossfights were eh, music was kinda nice, building was aight
my biggest issue with this game is it's movement

1038,This is the best 2D sandbox game of all time.
1039,eh. i get that lots of people love it but it just wasnt for me. way too much for the player to learn on their own and a very painful to navigate UI.
1040,Good Game
1041,"This Game is absolutely amazing, the amount of grinding to reward ratio is perfect! Also the game allows for a good amount of competition between friends. For instance we can have a contest to be like ""who can get this item first?"". This game has made many memories in the past, though arguing over loot is a problem."

1101,"The best game I ever played.
It is a masterpiece."
1102,"Terraria is a sandbox game with many I MEAN MANY cool areas to explore and epic tunes the boss fights are
so unique to one and another, if you think that isnt cool well you can play multiplayer up 16+ players and explore and fight. If you think that would be easy, try out expert mode or master mode add the seed: ""fortheworthy"" and do that. did i mention cool items? well the weapons in this game are something else they look so superior to some other sandbox games, and there is much to build to have town npc's living in your world. Trust me if you want a amazing experience like this, this game is for you."
1103,very goood
1104,it's good
1105,"This is one of my favorite games ever, and my favorite sandbox. So many possibilities, the devs are amazing. I love it!"
1106,"Terraria is a work of art. It is a masterpiece in community involvement and game development. While mildly annoying to mod, I am glad the ""final update"" bits are just that, bits. This game may have a lot to offer, but it's all justified on how you want to play the game. While I have a few complaints about the game, they are all minor. This game deserves the score it has."

But dont just take it from me. You can look at the other 980,000 reviews on Steam that will tell you the same. It is for a reason the top rated game on Steam."

1153,"Terraria is an exciting and engaging fishing game for all ages and demographics!

One might expect that the time spent on ""boss fights"" and ""survival"" mechanics might detract from the game's overall fishing experience, but, after completing the 200 fishing quests required for the ""Supreme Helper Minion!"" achievement, I can comfortably say the Terraria is a welcome staple to my collection of fishing games. The sheer variety of big catches and procedurally generated lakes and beaches makes each new world a unique fishing experience to enjoy for hours.

1330,"Terraria is a surprisingly fun game. There is a multitude of bosses and two large parts of the game in one world. in Pre - Hardmode you can find many awesome NPCs that you can build houses for, look at their shop, and see all of their different tips and tricks. If you ever need help or are stuck not knowing what to do, talk to the guide. The guide is your first NPC that spawns in right next to you when your world starts. He will try to help you with crafting recipies, tips, and more. Terraria also has a second stage called Hardmode which is basically a whole different stage compared to pre - hardmode. Overall, Terraria is a lot of fun and a very good game. Im saying this with 380 hours of experience in Terraria."
1331,"Get the game, its amazing and there are 0 downsides except maybe the time of your life you'll never get back"
1332,good game thunmbs up
1333,"Ahh, Terraria, where do we begin? I guess the Npcs! They have deep lore, good cutscenes, and are just a huge game element in general. Next, making money and profesions. profesions allow extra abilities, which can help to make money. making money also isnt complicated at all, you can farm, fish, forage for items, go mining, etc. Honestly, Altho mining and upgrading tools, and watering can get tiresome, there are always scents of reward everywhere. The only things I think it needs is a built-in creative mode, and that kids can grow up bigger than a toddler. Apart from that, it is a wonderful game whit amazing music!

Edit: I just wanted to make sure people understand that there are a ton of mods on this game, including CBJ item menu (which is personally use)"

1389,In my opinion it is better than Minecraft.It has more things in the game like more bosses different classes and not to mention the ores the huge vast variety of ores and gear make the game very enjoyable.The game is slightly more graphic and harder than Minecraft making it for the older audience.Other than the fact that it will be getting discontinued i'd say a 10/10 game.Try it it's a cheap yet very fun game!
1390,"I used master bait (for fishing of course) after i used my golden shower (powerful weapon obviously) to defeat mourning wood (clearly the Halloween boss), then i proceeded to grind for Big Booty (evidently an achievement)"

1408,I honestly think its pretty boring
1409,"Terraria is a top tier sandbox game. 
Every world is uniquely generated, with beauty and terrors across the land. There are countless resources and materials to be gathered and crafted into powerful weapons and armor. Fueled by an endless sense of progression, there are a variety of combat classes to enter, growing stronger to face the monsters and bosses of the world. Each defeated boss unlocks even more possibilities, filling the world with even more metals, creatures, and NPCs.  Then you can fill the world with your own structures, farms, and homes for the many NPCs to fill and offer you their wares.
Terraria is amazing because it is filled with possibilities and rewards at every corner."

1420,"This game has to be one of my favorite games, if not, my favorite. I've been playing since about 2014 and have put over 800 hours into it across all platforms. This game is easily the most repayable game I have ever set my hands on. If I had to choose between Minecraft and this, I would choose this every time. Once you play this game, you realize how many more things there is to do  rather than minecraft. There is so many more items, bosses, bricks, weapons, armor, pets, mobs biomes, etc... With Minecraft already being a super fun game to replay I'm sure you will find even more ways to replay this game."

1422,very cool

1424,"It's wild to look back and see how far this game has come in the decade since its release. The devs have poured so much love into this experience. With how deep the base game's content is, along with how massive the modding community is, this for 10$ might be the best deal on Steam."

1515,"When I first saw this game, I didn't like it. There were to many things on screen that I wasn't used to. Then, my cousin convinced me to give it a try because he loved it and wanted to play with me. At first, didn't like the way it was set up. There were no crafting recipes, so I didn't know how to get any better items. The combat felt a little weird. The hardest part about it is that they don't tell you where to go at all. After defeating the wall of flesh, it does start to give you little hints for what you should do, but it doesn't tell you how to do any of it. In a way, that is also were it shines. In a way similar to how minecraft treats it, the game throws you into the world and say explore. The game doesn't have story, so there is no need to rush whatever your doing. While there are bosses & items locked behind progression, there is an infinite amount of things you can do. Getting bored of not having a challenge? Simply make a new world in expert mode, or find unique ways to kill the guide. Even if you have done all that, there are still mods. Tired of nothing being a challenge anymore? Simply download Calamity or other big mods and it will feel like Terraria's final boss in a baby for what those mods have in store for you. Terraria is definitely a confusing game at first glance, but if you pull through that and start to understand what your doing, endless fun can be had."

Terraria
This is the same sandbox game where you can make all your dreams come true, in the sense of buildings, collecting things from bosses, and so on, in this game you can create your own world, make it how you want.

Plot: There is little plot here, or rather there is practically none, so I can‚Äôt say much about it.

GAMEPLAY: What about it, in terrarium 2D graphics, pixelated, but I don‚Äôt look at this game is worth the money, since it is a sandbox, here you can do everything from digging in a mine to eliminating bosses, in terrarium there are more than 600 types of swords alone! You can imagine it is 100 times more than in minecraft, the production of these swords is difficult, it is difficult to get them, there is an open world in the terraria, which is actually logical, the game is difficult, you can spend a lot of resources on one boss, a lot of time, and then screw it up , and then you again need to collect these resources, and spend a lot of time on this.

GRAPHICS: Any grandfather's computer from the times of the USSR will pull Terraria, so really, if in the world of games you are only interested in terraria, then you have a very large selection of laptop computers.

MINUSES: Updates stopped coming out in the game, the developers scored on the game, because they believe that they brought it to the end, and the maximum. There is no plot, only a small 3-5% of modern games with a plot

PROS: Open world, sandbox, catching fish, digging in a mine, jumping on clouds, building houses, bases, cities, exploring the world, this is one of the pluses of this game, I can also add that the game is optimized just for all PCs, and platforms, which is also a plus.

CONCLUSION: The game is beautiful, as well as the developers who have tried a lot on this project, terraria, which received steam awards in 2021, has proved that it is the best sandbox for the entire existence of mankind! I advise everyone to buy this wonderful game, thank you for your attention)

1591,I've played Terraria since before the 1.2 update and it's the one sandbox game I come back to every time I get an itch. This game is genuinely a demonstration of what can be done when the developers of a game and the community truly love the work that is done. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone that might even be curious about it.
1592,very fun experience
1593,Pain
1594,Very Pog
1595,"Great game, love it."
1596,This game is an absolute gem. Even after almost 500 hours of playtime I still wanna go back and play this masterpiece. Although I didn't much care for the 1.4 update compared to the 1.3 update I still love this game. I wonder what could make this game better?
1597,I hate the Guide

1709,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

1769,"Upon creating a character (as long as it isn't a Journey Mode character, in which case you will receive the Iron Shortsword), you automatically receive the Copper Shortsword. Should you have tossed it out however, a new one can be made with 5 Copper Bars (15 Copper Ore). You should try to keep the old one however, as tin is not a replacement. Players with tin worlds will need to obtain copper from crates, the Extractinator, kill Slimes carrying copper ore, or go to another world that has copper.  The Starfury is a sword that creates falling star projectiles, similar to the Fallen Stars found at night. It can be found inside chests on Floating Islands. Keep in mind, though, that not all chests contain a Starfury, and not all islands have a chest. If no chests have a Starfury, it is necessary to fish for Sky Crates.  Terraria's Sword in the Stone, the Enchanted Sword is a sword that shoots sword beams and can be found in Enchanted Sword Shrines. You'll recognize one when you see a 1 block wide shaft leading to a rainbow shaped cave at the end with 2 pools of water on each side and a sword in the middle. Enchanted Sword Shrines are rare and are not guaranteed in a World. Furthermore, a lot of the time, the sword is fake. You can tell if it is fake if the sword look dull and bland. A real one has blue and yellow with a red jewel connecting the blade and the hilt. A real sword has 90% of dropping the Enchanted Sword (item), and a 10% chance dropping a Terragrim. If you were unable to find a Sword Shrine, you can also obtain it by opening Golden or Titanium Crates. Golden Crates can be fished in Pre-Hardmode, while Titanium Crates can be fished in Hardmode. Both crates contain roughly the same loot.  The Bee Keeper is a sword that inflicts the Confused debuff to enemies that it hits. When it hits an enemy, it also releases friendly bees that will damage nearby enemies. It has a 33% chance of dropping from the Queen Bee. Queen Bee can be summoned by breaking Larva inside Bee Hives, which are located in the Underground Jungle, or by using the Abeemination in the surface or underground Jungle biome. See Guide:Queen Bee strategies for more information on how to defeat the Queen Bee.  The Seedler is a Hardmode sword that you can obtain from defeating Plantera, with a 14.29% chance of dropping. When used, it fires out seed-like projectiles, which explode into tiny shards upon a period of time or when hitting an enemy.  Plantera can only be summoned by breaking Plantera's Bulbs, a naturally spawning object that can generate after all mechanical bosses are defeated. See Guide:Plantera strategies for more information on how to defeat Plantera.  The Horseman's Blade is a Hardmode post-Plantera sword that has a 12.5% chance of dropping from Pumpking, an event boss that spawns during a Pumpkin Moon. It spawns pumpkin heads that home in on enemies after hitting an enemy. The Pumpkin Moon can only be initiated by using a Pumpkin Moon Medallion. See Guide:Pumpkin Moon strategies for more information on how to survive a Pumpkin Moon and defeat Pumpking.  The Influx Waver is a Hardmode, post-Golem sword that has a  16.67% (1/6) chance (11.11% (1/9) chance in  Console and Mobile versions) of dropping from Martian Saucer, an event boss that spawns during Martian Madness. When used, it fires a sword beam projectile that after hitting an enemy, can return up to two times to attack the same enemy or other nearby enemies. The Martian Madness event is initiated when a Martian Probe detects a player and is let to escape. See Guide:Martian Madness strategies for more information on how to survive Martian Madness and defeat the Martian Saucer.  The Star Wrath is a Hardmode sword that has a 11.11% (1/9) chance of dropping from the Moon Lord. Whenever it's swung, three falling star projectiles shoot out from above towards the cursor's direction, dealing double the sword's base damage. The projectiles produce light and can pierce. The Moon Lord boss is summoned after defeating all four Celestial Pillars during the Lunar Events, or by using a Celestial Sigil. See Guide:Lunar Events strategies for more information on how to complete the Lunar Events and defeat the Moon Lord.  The Meowmere is a Hardmode sword that has a 11.11% (1/9) chance of dropping from the Moon Lord. It spawns a cat's head projectile with a rainbow trail when swung, which is affected by gravity, pierces multiple enemies, and ricochets four times, dissipating on the fifth hit. The Moon Lord boss is summoned after defeating all four Celestial Pillars during the Lunar Events, or by using a Celestial Sigil. See Guide:Lunar Events strategies for more information on how to complete the Lunar Events and defeat the Moon Lord. It should be noted that although the Meowmere has a higher listed base damage than the Zenith, the Zenith has a much higher DPS overall.  The Terra Blade is a Hardmode sword that is crafted from various different swords that you can obtain throughout the entire progression of the game. It is made by combining a True Excalibur and a True Night's Edge, which is crafted by combining the Excalibur and the Night's Edge each with a Broken Hero Sword, a material dropped from Mothron during the Solar Eclipse. The Excalibur is made using Hallowed Bars obtained from defeating Mechanical bosses, while the Night's Edge is made by combining the following swords at an Altar: Blade of Grass, Muramasa, Fiery Greatsword, and either the Light's Bane or the Blood Butcherer. See Guide:Crafting a Terra Blade for more info on how to craft a Terra Blade.  Once all the necessary swords are obtained, you can craft a Zenith at a Mythril or Orichalcum anvil.  The Zenith is a Hardmode, post-Moon Lord melee weapon crafted using a variety of swords obtained throughout the game's progression. When swung, the sword sprites of its component swords fly towards enemies within a 20-tile radius of the cursor (regardless of where the cursor is on the screen), and circle back in quick, frenzied arcs. They pass through solid blocks, and three swords will appear per use (at base melee speed). Each sword sprite deals the weapon's full damage. The Zenith is capable of autoswing. Its best modifier is Legendary.  The first sword generated on each swing will always be a Zenith projectile, which generates a mint green trail. Each sword generated will have a unique swing color, which generates a large amount of light. This can be used to reveal parts of the minimap. The Zenith ignores enemy invincibility frames. The Zenith can attack anywhere that the cursor can reach. Its range can be increased simply by using higher resolutions, larger monitors, or even multiple monitors. This is no longer true in 1.4.1, as Zenith can only go up to 600 pixels vertically and 960 pixels horizontally. Equipment and modifiers that increase melee speed change the number of swords that appear per use, but have no effect on the number of swords thrown per second, nor the swords' velocity. Each individual sword sprite may register multiple hits on an enemy, depending on size and positioning. Swords also deal damage behind the player on their return trip. Despite being nearly identical to its copper counterpart, the Tin Shortsword cannot be used to craft the Zenith. This is presumably due to the Copper Shortsword's role as the very first sword every player will encounter (with the exception of Journey Mode characters). The Zenith appears to have semi-homing capabilities. When the sword is dragged near an enemy, but not enough for the natural arch to reach it, one sword sprite will come out of the loop and hit the enemy.[1] This is especially useful in the Mobile version Mobile version, for players who are keen on using Aim and Use, as such toggle restricts the Zenith's range considerably. The Zenith is generally agreed to be the game's strongest weapon, making it ideal for any type of fight."

1778,"This is easily my favorite game. There's so much you can do, some much to explore, so many biomes and enemy diversities. There's also a lot of bosses and mini bosses you can defeat, and depending on the difficulty your playing on, you'll get better, or worse, loot. Theirs also different classes you can choose from like ranger, mage, summoner, and melee. If you like to play games modded, you can install TmodLoader, via steam, and install all sorts of cool and wacky mods. BUY THIS GAME!"

1896,"The ultimate 2D sandbox! Terraria is a great game to play with others (playing it solo is a bit sad though). Whether you like to build, explore a vast world or (especially) fight mighty monsters, you'll most likely find yourself enjoying this video game. It's a real classic!"

1901,Amazing game. i have 599 hours in it and in a few months i will have 1000 hours. my favorite game
1902,"The memories I have from Terraria are all very close to my heart. Terraria was the first game my parents ever bought for me that I played on a crappy computer around when the game it was released. Even without the Wall of Flesh, Hardmode, Moon Lord, mods, or large crew of npcs this game held my attention for hours as a kid. I am writing this review out of nostalgia because due to some miracle, all of the worlds I committed to the cloud over the years magically uncorrupted themselves earlier today. That window into the past brought back so many hundreds of hours of fun, intrigue, anger, happiness, and so much more which brought a genuine smile to me. Terraria is a game that can be enjoyed by someone of any age, I would reccomend older people enjoy it with friends but that is not necessary. I will not say something as cheesy as, ""the possibilities are limitless,"" because without mods Terraria is a very linear game progression wise. The part of this game that keeps on giving for me is how I can log on with friends and forget the world for a few hours as we explore a world and build within it. I have nothing negative to say. The developers care about the game and its players, which is evident in the content and extra releases still happening after the, ""Journey's end,"" update. If anyone who has ever been on the developer team reads this review, I want to thank you for over a thousand hours of happiness both when I was a kid and now as an adult. If you have not bought Terraria yet, find a few friends and figure it out together, the wiki is a great tool. Thank you for reading, I know this is a long winded and messy review, I just cannot put my love for this game into words."
1903,Nice
1904,"its cool
"
1905,Pretty solid.
1906,Peak fiction in 2D form.
1907,its just so fun building a class and overall playing through having to fight bosses to progress im sad the last update will be coming anytime in the future but glad to hear there's a possible terraria 2 coming worth every cent and would never want to refund.
1908,good game
1909,"a very fun game, lot of thing to do, great for playing with friend worth to play"
1910,"Absolutely positive !!
Joy with friends or alone are very awesome."
1911,"Fun game to play with friends, though the difficulty curve may be a bit much for new players trying to go it solo."
1912,"nice game
"
1913,h8 it
1914,"This game has a lot of potential for hundreds of hours of fun. It has literally hundreds of weapons, blocks, and enemies alongside multiple types of invasions and dozens of bosses for you to work towards beating. The staggering amount of variety found in this game works well with the different difficulty levels and almost completely unrestricted building to allow you to create anything your imagination desires as well as fostering an absolutely tremendous amount of re-play ability. If you somehow don't already own this game and are a fan of the genre, do yourself a favor and get yourself a copy because I promise you wont regret it."
1915,Very good
1916,epic
1917,PLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1918,OwO

1948,This game is going to be in a museum one day.
1949,Idk its just a very fun game :I
1950,Terraria is the best game there is. I think it is essential to play with calamity mod its great that the mod loader (tModLoader) is free on steam. I have played more hours on this game but I only got it on steam recently(I had it on gog before).
1951,adawd
1952,velly velly ggoood

"
1964,"One of the best games ever created. The developers are amazing, the community is amazing, the game is amazing.

I still remember playing Terraria on my beat-up Kindle as a kid, I've spent countless hours on this game across pretty much every platform. The building, the fighting, the mining, the exploring, the crafting are all absolutely fantastic."
1965,Amazing for e-dating.
1966,"Game has a initial steep learning curve though once you understand it you can appreciate the deep level of lore and options that the game-play provides, overall great game 9/10."
1967,yes
1968,"Many people compare Terraria and Minecraft, and it's true; they are both voxel-based mining games. However, Terraria simmers a lot of what Minecraft is and then makes up for it in the exciting combat. Please don't get me perplexed, you can still create fantastic and exciting structures in Terraria, but the euphoria that some Minecraft creations can invoke is not found in Terraria. Suppose you prefer an emphasis on combat, boss battles, and equipment upgrades. But still want to be able to mine resources, create defenses, and terraform. In that case, Terraria is most certainly a great option. This review is why it's one of my favorite games on Steam."
1969,so basically minecraft (;
1970,"Games very fun, 7 hours in on the first day of getting it and i've already taken down the eye of cthulhu, and destroyed skeletron! what are you waiting for? get it now!"

1987,it is fun
1988,GREAT GAME!!! I love it!
1989,tehahria fun
1990,them damn eyes
1991,"Mobile, console, PC, I have spent well over 1000+ hours on this game overall.
I enjoy the game. The beginning of a playthrough is always so slow and boring to me, but after I kill EoC (Eye of Cthulhu) it picks up pace.

 Although I play 1.3 TModLoader more than 1.4 vanilla. I just find 1.3 much faster along with the mods I use, like Calamity or Enigma Mod.

With this being said, I fully recommend this game to anyone who likes 2D sandbox survival games.
Side note; You can download texture packs and worlds."
1992,"If you like chaos, install mods. If you like having fun with friends, get ready to play alone after stealing shit from them. If you don't have a 3090, I recommend buying one before playing this game."
1993,this game is a amazing experience
1994,anal
1995,ok

2004,"I love Terraria. I've been playing it for 6 years, and it has brought me joy. Would buy again. When you first buy it, it seems kinda boring. I can see why. But after getting into hard mode, it gets way fun. I like the bosses, events, items, and other stuff. The classes are super cool too. You can be a wizard, be a ranger, be a swordsman, summon minions, it's great."
2005,"It is a great game filled with cool stuff to collect, and it is relaxing to play MOST of the time. I also like the exciting events that come around every once in a while."

to this day we still play, sometimes normal sometimes modded. i much prefer this over minecraft, even though minecraft we usually play for a bit longer each time.
i love it, everything about it. from the iconic memorable music, to the typical melee set I ALWAYS end up falling back to lol, regardless of how many times i try to do ranged.

im not creative enough to make the amazing buildings they have in the trailers or the stuff you see in the community forums, but thats okay. i love this game so much. cannot reccommend it enough to anyone and everyone. No im not being paid to say this lmao, i just fucking love this game."

2072,"I am a 48 year old mother, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single mother to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded Terraria and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my husband had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

2082,"One of my all time favorite games, Terraria is a work of art the game play is super fun, the progression great, the bosses unique and exciting and the music is just the best. There is so much replayability with different difficulties, things to do and ways to play. Terraria is definitely best with friends but also still great to play alone so if your looking for a game with a lot of potential play time, a game to let your creativity flow, something for you and your friends to have a good time playing or just some fire music definitely get Terraria."

2115,very fun game that you can play at your own pace. You could rush down every boss or just kick back and do what you want. you can even play with your friends
2116,Good game
2117,goooooooooood game
2118,"After 500hrs i think i can make a statment here is my top 5 reasons to why you should buy it
1: its a core geam u can almost ask anyone what terraria is and they will kinda know and just over all u never rly run out of stuff even when u are done u can still take a friend or two under ur wing and help them learn the game over all this game is a great game
2: trust the progress of the game it will not look fun the first part of the game but if you would be able to get the best gear just like that and even when you are done with the game there are 2 more non cheat game modes to play with other loot from bosses and more 
3: its a great team working on the game always up to date of what the players want bug fixes all the time and sometimes new bosses u will get atleast 30 hours of pure fun
4: maybe you are here bc you dont know if you are gonna buy it or not i would say go for it if you have a friend then just go and buy it for the solid price of 9.99$ its very cheap for the fun you are gonna get
5: its a sandbox game like minecraft its more compact than minecraft but it will make u sure of all the bosses and events that will happen
i would like to note that my english is not the best but i am still trying to help here game is a 11/10"

2284,I still can't believe how a 2d game became one of the most immersive games for me. In a harsh world you create a safe haven for yourself and once you defeat all the bosses you can go back and relish in the memory of your accomplishment and get this homely nostalgic feeling of the place you've built.

2293,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

2318,"This game in has been been called the 2D Minecraft but Terraria couldn't be anymore different. The boss mechanics in this game are fun and encourage you to find better items to progress through the game. It also heavily encourages you to make new worlds and characters to try different more challenging playthroughs on harder difficulties. The building in this game is also very fun and rewarding, finishing building your massive base or an NPC prison is fun. Cant get enough of this game its constantly being updated adding new bosses and items cant wait for the future of this game. MUST TRY 

PS Dont give up when it gets hard"

2425,I played this game for years and I always came back to it because there's always so much more to do and you can't ever get bored of it you can build different types of things or play on different types of maps and if you want to add more and harder things there's tmodloader which adds tons of enjoyable hard mods like calamity. So even though the game has been out for a long time there are a lot of enjoyable things to do
2426,have to play this game alone because my friends dont have the sigma mindset to get through it

Cheap price of $9.99 and frequent sales.

A crap load of customization options.
Amazing mod support.

I highly suggest at least giving the game a try. The developers really care about this game and continue to update it with new and fun things to do.
"
2450,"Honestly the fact that this amount of content is available for such a low price is absurd. Easily one of the best games I've ever played. Endless creativity and freedom, play with whatever style suits you."

2558,"Genuinely some of the most fun I've had in a game with my friends in a very long while. Nothing beats setting yourself up to beat up every single boss the world has to offer, creating artificial biomes to farm out new and exciting items, even building homes for NPC's so they can have a house even after you leave. 

A sentimental feeling comes over me as I finish another run, but it's worth smiling about, you know? The content people make, the community's ideas, even the developers, everyone makes this game worth playing. Genuinely, if you haven't before, it'll be some of the best ten dollars you'll ever spend. I know it was for me."
2559,"The game is pretty fun, It's a lot more enjoyable with your friends."

2572,"I've played this game for years across many platforms and it has always been a game I manage to get sucked back into, no matter what time of year it is. I've played normal mode, expert and so on and i always manage to find some way to enjoy myself. Now with mod those possibilities are endless. 10/10 Would always play again."

2574,"good game

2575,"I've had this game since before 1.2, and it has never felt dated ever since I first picked up the game. I just recently got 100% completion of this game, and I can proudly say that I've enjoyed Terraria for all of the years I've had it. From fighting waves of bosses with my brother to trying to scrounge up the materials to make the Ankh Shield and Zenith... it's been an amazing journey.

Though my journey on Terraria has come to an end, I still intend to play much more with tMod. Thank you, and may our paths cross again... it's been an amazing run."

2590,"I am a 64 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Terraria and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories."

2594,AMAZING GAME
2595,Fun fun fun
2596,Amazing!
2597,Great Game
2598,it is very good but it is hard to get into multiplayer when you tart to play
2599,the video game of all time
2600,"Terraria is one of the few games I continue to play long after completing all achievements and many many play throughs. I cannot recommend it more to anyone who enjoys a thorough, well thought out adventure game. Including challenging boss battles, dynamic gameplay, creative building mechanics and the most enjoyable multiplayer aspect I have experienced in a game. 
Over 800 hours of gameplay later I use this game as a baseline for all other games. If another game gives me close to the same enjoyment as this game then it is worth my time. 
My only fault with the game is that there are no longer any updates coming, however, this seems reasonable considering the game is quite old at this stage. 

Absolute banger of a game 10/10"
2601,best game
2602,boring

2619,"Edit ( I played an additional 25 hours and guess what ? Woke up today and my character and world are both gone AGAIN. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!

I don't know what they did to this game recently but i logged in one day to play, and my character and worlds are all gone. Unfortunate but a fresh start didn't sound bad. So i make a new character and world and within a week, both of them are just gone as well. I decide to make another character and world and wouldn't you know it, after a week of playing, my world is gone, AGAIN. I played right before bed, i wake up, try to log in, but no. It's not any of my other games either, it is just Terraria, which is shame because i honestly love this game. But until they fix whatever the hell they did. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."
2620,"Excellent game, lots of fun to co-op, it is great for SP as well, I highly recommend if you enjoy minecraft, or 2d scrollers, a great combination of the two. Hours of endless fun. Lots of bosses, lots of deaths, 11/10, would die again."

2656,"honestly an amazing game, the art is amazing and can be supplemented with texture packs if you don't like them. i have played around 500 hours and i can still play it without getting bored, and if you do you can mod it with tModLoader. the combat is difficult for all stages of players as there are always new challenges people can place on themselves.
the building system is amazing and has tons of blocks to choose from. 10/10 game. its amazing."

2717,"This game is beautiful, I've been playing Terraria since its beginning, following it to 1.2 on the Xbox 360, to 1.3 on the Xbox 1 to finally getting it on Steam in the prime of 1.4.
It is a magnificently crafted game with plenty to do, with many aspects for plentiful amounts of players, showing technicals, building and of course a crown favorite, killing things, it allows you to explore what you like about the game, and you might end up playing with others. 
I would recommend this game to everyone, although ""2D games are going out of fashion"" I would still play this years from now."
2718,its ok
2719,"Nah just don't think about it.
Just buy it and have a good time."

2721,"Played it just a bit, pretty cool

In all seriousness tho, amazing game, super fun with friends and tons of things to do even after finishing the game (which includes modding). Has the best developer (Redigit) which ACTUALLY LISTENS TO FANS. 11/10 game, just buy it, you won't be dissapointed."
2722,all video games are a waste of time and i am a filthy addict

2742,"Personally, I love this game, it is such an extremely fun, progressive, adventure game that's even better with friends. my only issue was that I had to delete a world because of data corruption files, but that's it."

110% recommend to anyone"
2757,"Very fun. I've been playing it with someone else and after minimal research, we discovered how vast the content of the game really has. We didn't realise that by doing certain actions, you could trigger a mode change (hard mode) and that was crazy... It's a very good game, sandbox-ey at the beginning, can get pretty intense, so if you've got the time, enjoy exploring and creating, this is the game."

Getting a pc I remebered how much fun I had playing this game and my brother bought it for me and I fell right into this game again, this sound terrible but in the last two weeks i have almost 150 hours on this game and cannot stop playing, I would recomend this game to anyone doesnt matter what games you play this should be one of them. Thank you for being part of my childhood."
2773,I think I hate it but I also love it?
2774,"This game is the best of it's genre. It is crazy how Re-Logic actually pulled off the idea that more stuff equals better game. At times it can be very frustrating, but the point when you win makes you feel accomplished in life. I would recommend this game to anyone who has at least two brain cells. 10/10."

2790,"I've played Terraria off and on across multiple platforms since it's initial release. It's ALWAYS been a game I've come back to. I have so many fond memories of this game, and with mods through tModLoader, I've gotten well over 2k hours out of this game. (Hours aren't properly tracked on Steam). Terraria is easily one of the best games I've ever played and any survival/builder game I play is compared directly to Terraria, even if it isn't 2D. I love this game and the developers Re-digit are so amazing, talented and friendly towards the community that it's one of those games you can support year after year without a doubt in your mind as to who or what you're supporting. Absolutely love this game, I can't say enough good things about it.

It's on almost every platform. If you haven't played Terraria, do yourself a favor and play this fantastic, amazing game!"
2791,its cool
2792,"Terraria is a game were you think that you're going to play for 10 mins but, you played 10 hours in one sitting.

I believe some tax paying Average Joe everyday customers (one of which had a 15 year old son) watched in horror as this great ‚ÄúAccident‚Äù happened. It was truly horrifying for the staff to witness and I have never been allowed back in a Popeyes every again. My Popeyes Chicken Sandwich was very good on that day and I would 100% recommend this sandwich to anyone. It was well worth my hard earned dollars. 10/10
"
2801,The game is amazing all around. It somehow finds a perfect balance between time consuming and content filled. You never feel unimpressed when you gain a new item and you will never leave a game of Terraria without wanting to play again. There is nothing I can think of that would make this game better. 10/10
2802,i like it
2803,"Extremely fun, TONS of items and things to do, would recommend this game to anybody."

2846,"This game is absolutely amazing! I've played this for a long time, on both pc, console and mobile, and can safely say it is one of my all time favourite games. The progression is great, there are so many ways to play, the modding community is massive, and the devs are are constantly pouring their hearts out to improve their game (even if it's always the ""last update""). Best game on steam in my opinion. Keep at it ReLogic!"

2850,"You came here for a review, but you're leaving with a Pumpkin Pie Recipe that'll please all your Terrarians this spooky season!

Ingredients
Pat-in-the-Pan Pastry
- 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/3 cup vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons cold water

Filling
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 can (15 oz) pumpkin (not pumpkin pie mix)
- 1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk

Sweetened Whipped Cream
- 3/4 cup whipping cream
- 2 tablespoons sugar

Steps

1. Heat oven to 425¬∞F. In medium bowl, mix flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the oil with fork until all flour is moistened. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all water is absorbed. Shape pastry into a ball. Press in bottom and up side of 9-inch glass pie plate.

2. In large bowl, beat eggs slightly with wire whisk or hand beater. Beat in 1/2 cup sugar, the cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon salt, ginger, cloves, pumpkin and milk.

3. To prevent spilling, place pastry-lined pie plate on oven rack before adding filling. Carefully pour pumpkin filling into pie plate. Bake 15 minutes.

4. Reduce oven temperature to 350¬∞F. Bake about 45 minutes longer or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Place pie on cooling rack. Cool completely, about 2 hours.

5. In chilled medium bowl, beat whipping cream and 2 tablespoons sugar with electric mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form. Serve pie with whipped cream. Store in refrigerator.

2882,it is good
2883,.
2884,"Very fun game to play with friends, after the base game make sure to try out some mods for even more great content."
2885,"I heard terraria made 1 million reviews while still being overwhelmingly positive, and I haven't left a review so I'll help keep it that way, since this game deserves it"
2886,"This is a game I knew about back in like 2015 or something. I always saw friends play it on mobile but never got into it. I have to admit it is a really addictive game as soon as you start. The aesthetic of the game is very pleasing. And I like the more simplistic aspect of the game, while also having a lot more complexities and MMO aspects rather than a game like say Minecraft. At this point I have been playing for 10 hours and I cannot wait to see how the rest of the experience unfolds."

2944,"This is a labour of love for sure. 
A lot of effort was put into this game and it shows. It's not just 2D minecraft, there is so much more to this game. This game has been getting content patches since 2011 and it was already a solid package back then.

+Building is pretty complex.
+Boss fights are super fun.
+Different events. Like goblin invasions, blood moon, etc.
+Can be warrior, mage, ranger, summoner.
+A lot of really fun biomes.
+CO-OP.
+Awesome music.

And a lot more, really."

2986,Minecraft hard-mode
2987,"i liked this game becuase it gives a sort of classic pixel vibe. another reason is becuase ive been playing for almost 180 hours and ive basicaly only completed like 5 percent of the game. there's so many bosses, weapons, tools , armours, and above all that stuff they put in the game they also put like so many decorations ive got like 30 or 40 different decorations of like 5 different materials or something and there's still more. so no matter how much i sem to do there's always something more with this game which is my key problem with every other game i play. that's the reason i think other people should play this game. also i know that this game is like 15 dollars or something but trust me it's worth it and ive barely scratched the surface of this game. so yeah i definetly think other people should play this game. the only thing i have a slight problem in this game with is the fact that i had to sacrafice the guide and another one won't spawn for some reason."
2988,im just doing this because of the reddit meme so the voices would stop
2989,yes
2990,You can do whatever you want in this game and whatever you end up doing you will have a blast doing it!
2991,just demb fun love it.

The Bossfights are very well constructed and heart-pounding exciting! gotta love this game. Plus, you dont need a Gaming PC or thousand dollar GFX Card to run it beautifully :)"
3017,yes
3018,just a really good adventure game.
3019, Do not buy this you will find they removed ownership from your account if you stop playing for a while. I bought this game it was not a rental now they take it away from me and want me to buy it again. Hoping i forgot I purchased it. Nice scam. I have the receipt.
3020,I honestly love this game. If you can get past the difficult beginning this game actually allows you to use your skill and creativity to have a great time.
3021,super fun 2d plain game way better than block heads
3022,"this game has so much replay-ability, it also has so much progression in one game, I spent hours and hours and hours on this game back in the Xbox 360 days. So many bosses with dedicated loot drops, so many hundreds of weapons to use and classes to try! It might get a little dull at times, but grab some potions and get right back to it!"
3023,fun

3031,"I nominate Terraria for Steam's ""Labor of Love"" award every year. The devs have put so much work into this game, even when they've said they were all done, and it shows. Many people summarize Terraria as ""2D Minecraft,"" which is true to an extent, but it's also so much more. I love the build variety, cute pets, exploration, and crazy boss battles Terraria has to offer. It's a game I'll always come back to eventually."
3032,One of the best games ive ever played. Grab a friend (or a few) and play this game!! You wont regret it.
3033,"One of the best games I've ever played. 

Game play for me felt better than single-player minecraft. All throughout felt better than minecraft but is definitely more grindy like certain armour or weapons requiring a lot of the specific ore to craft. This point is not that bad overall as if you are able to have a video in the background then it makes this whole process way easier. Pre-hardmode for me is boring and slow but not because of a lot of content that is too much to get through but more because mining and getting around takes ages as you do not have the gear. The game is very replayable with different classes comes different play styles. Melee which was my favourite as high damage and high armour, following the boss around. With melee you only really manage health but if you are playing terraria then everybody has to so I guess just not dying. When to ingage and disengage to heal; being melee you are the tank and the boss will follow you so knowing when to do these two things are kinda important. Early game melee for me (maybe different for others) kinda sucks as you actually have to melee lol. After hardmode, pretty much all melee weapons become ranged so there is no real melee weapons where you have to go close to the enemy to do damage (of course being within hitting range of an enemy with a hardmode melee weapon does more damage but why would you risk taking big damage against a boss). Mage and range are similar both having to manage something with mage being mana and ranged being ammo types like bullets or arrows. Both these classes are high DPS so if you are looking for a less tanky build but high dps, these two are good choices (I think that ranger is a slightly more tanky but less dps class, thought this point is kinda weird as armour sets in the game can allow for tanky builds of both of these classes but I meant in a more general way). I am glad for the kinda recent update for summoner, adding in whips was good as before, if you had summoned all your minions then you would just take a weapon from a different class and use it. These are my least played classes so I do not know much about them. I only really played with friends and then I only played melee because for me it was simple and boss followed you. Re-logic added NPCs needing appropriate housing was kinda annoying but oh well.

Early boss fights can be annoying but after the first couple times, they become very easy, the only real limitation could be the lack of armour or accessories. They can be seen as interesting fights but for me, I kinda just skipped king slime until I got the eye of Cthulhu shield (expert mode drop) then went back for him. Skeletron when you are prepared can still be a decently hard fight but after a couple defeats and getting down the moveset, can be easy. Queen bee can be skipped but I would say to always try fight because the game its in the game, the drops are also very useful for wall of flesh fight. WALL OF FLESH is one annoying piece of flesh. Whenever I play and it might be because I am just bad but I cannot defeat this dude first time on a playthrough. Very annoying but with my indomitable human spirit, I persevered and continued through. If you are new, this where the game puts on its big boy pants. Normal enemies before that would be one shot with your pre-hardmode gear will now hit you for half your health but with terraria, a bit of mining and breaking demon altars later, you will be able to take on the mech bosses. They are the next big hurdle. Skeletron prime, the twins and the destroyer. I feel like everyone has a problem with one of these mech bosses and finds the other ones easy. For me, the destroyer was always a walk in the park, the twins always kicked my ass and skeletron prime was kinda a challenge but with the second challenge I always won. The next hurdle is plantera; prepare carefully and this should be a walk in the park. Making a larger arena that what you think will be needed will always be helpful for all the bosses. The defeat of plantera unlocks the golem. For me golem was another walk in the park. Lunatic cultist and moon lord are next but you can defeat duke fishron for extra weapons for the upcoming fights. Lunatic cultist for me was not a memorable fight, it went by too quickly, maybe I was over prepared. Moon lord is next. Moon lord is difficult. I never can defeat it on my first try. But this is it. The last boss (not really as there is now the queen slime) before finishing endgame. All the building for NPCs, potion making, gear gathering, all the bosses, mining and farming mobs. It all leads to this. After the pillars are down, its time. The fight will be tough but the feeling you get when defeating it is worth it, and thats it. Game over. End game content is pretty much just destroying previous bosses you had trouble with with end game gear.

I have never wrote reviews before so there is probably a lot of errors but this took too long for me so ask any questions you have and I will try to answer them quickly. Overall, game is very good. Has a very active modding community which I have not touched on. If you enjoy Terraria then download tmodloader, calamity is very good and offers post end game content so even more stuff to do. 

TLDR -  GAME IS GOOD, PRICE IS AMAZING, GOOD MODDING COMMUNITY **BUY IF THIS IN ANY WAY FITS YOUR STYLE OF GAMES, EVEN IF IT DOES NOT THEN EVEN TRYING YOU MAY ENJOY IT**"

3074,good
3075,"Terraria - an addicting and amazing game

Back in February, my friends introduced me to this game, and it was the best thing I ever experienced. The progression system is super good, and each step you take feels so satisfying, especially when you get stuck at a certain part and finally overcome the challenge presented.

Terraria also contains plenty of weapons, items, class builds, and features. Whether you want to dish out tons of damage, be super fast, or tank anything and everything that could possibly hurt you, it's all possible in Terraria.

This game is also very grindy, so have fun spending lots of time to get one weapon or item you so desire, but the feeling of attaining it will be like no other. 

Overall, 10/10 game, would absolutely recommend."
3076,Great game 10/10 would play again

3078,"There's a reason this game is rated #1 on steam. An insane amount of love and care went into this game, with enough replay value to come back again and again, all available for a price that's basically highway robbery for what you get. Absolutely one of the best games money can buy. Like seriously buy it. Just buy it. It's only $10. It might as well be on an eternal 60% sale like seriously buy it, it even has modding support that goes through steam like there is really no reason to not get it if you like this kind of game like seriously just buy it seriously just do it like come on"
3079,"This game was amazing. Great game, the start of the game can be a bit boring and confusing but after a while of gameplay you can have an amazing experience. The game is very confusing the first time you play it I highly suggest going to the wiki or having someone to refer to when playing the game. This game has lots of content and hours of gameplay can be put into the game. Overall I highly suggest playing the game."

3090,"A while ago my friend convinced me to buy Terraria and play it with him, we played for a bit then i fell to temptation and used The Builder's workshop. I got bored and it ruined my experience. Take it from me, never use it. You get bored and stop playing the game entirely. I got to 20 hours on the game then gave up from boredom. However Regardless of that I played it though normally and it is the most fun experience even when you don't have friends to play with! I would also recommend Tmodloader and to play the 'calamity mod' It adds so much to the game and since my experience was ruined has really helped me have a lasting addiction to the game with a thrill to last. 10/10 game and i would highly recommend it to anyone wondering to buy. IMPORTANT [Terraria does kind of just throw you into the game so watch some pre hard mode advancement tutorials on you tube and use the guide if the item says 'material' in its description to help you find out how to advance!]"

3156,"I've played this game for around a hundred hours at the time of making this review, so I thought it was time to do a review.

Terraria is a great game. Often people call it ""2d Minecaft"" either ironically or otherwise, but it seriously isn't. This game may share similarities with minecraft in the way that you can build pretty much whatever you want and you begin the game by harvesting a tree however that's about as far as it gets. Terraria includes boss fights, a variety of npcs and enemies, as well as a replay-able class system. There are 5 damage types in Terraria, which includes the four ""classes"" (With a classless class), these are: Ranged, Melee, Magic and Summon. There is also just ""damage"" damage, which is the classless class I mentioned prior. 

I wont go into modding for it is an entirely different thing, but it is much like the base game but even better. If you are to mod the game I recommend the calamity mod, it's difficult but insanely fun."

3170,"A fantastic game that became a part of my childhood including many others'. The only drawback in my case is modding. You have to download mods in a separate application making you unable to gain achievements. But all in all, it is still a very solid game. It is a must-have especially for those enjoy exploration and boss battles.

3248,"[h1] Personal Description [/h1]
I was originally going to write this review saying how this is not 2D Minecraft but as I was thinking about the differences, yeah, this is 2D Minecraft. You start with practically nothing, gather wood, go mining for resources to craft new things, fight bosses, get super op, beat the final boss. Yes, I'm well aware of the differences between the games like items, and game mechanics but honestly, mods can change all of that for both games. So if you're looking for 2D Minecraft with more of a focus on mystical stuff, here you go.

[h1] Ratings [/h1]
Here is where I rate each aspect of Terraria based on my player experience. 0 = Low | 10 = high

[b] Graphics [/b]
7/10 - Good for a pixel game. Not like ray-tracing is gonna do much here lol

[b] Price [/b]
0/10 - Honestly, I think $10 USD is too cheap for a game like this.

[b] Grinding [/b]
5/10 - Game progression is slow and fast at different points of the game so grinding is pretty necessary.

[b] Combat [/b]
8/10 - For me, being a mage is the most fun so I really enjoyed the combat. 

[b] Exploration [/b]
3/10 - It's like playing Minecraft. A world is a world and sometimes you'll find some cool random generation.

[b] Audio/Soundtrack [/b]
6/10 - No complaints. Nothing epic but the mood fits.

[b] Story [/b]
0/10 - Does Terraria have a story? I'm not Mattpat so I'm not gonna go searching for a story that isn't right in front of me.

[b] Bugs) [/b]
0/10 - Pretty damn polished. 

[b] Multiplayer [/b]
Exactly as you'd expect. Works very well and players can do just about anything in eachother's worlds.

[b] Overall Gameplay [/b]
9/10 - I may have scored low on a bunch of the categories but I still rate this game high. You'll have a blast if this is your type of game."

There's lots to do and if you develop burnout after beating the game you can do challenges, class-specific worlds, even get mods from tModLoader. The game is worth it's price and I highly suggest it for anyone that's into boss rush games, adventure games, and/or building games."

3330,"Definitely far exceeds the value you get for the money for those that love sandbox style games. Probably also well worth it for fans of action RPGs. And no, it is not simply '2d Minecraft' because the focus of these games is a bit different. Terraria is more focused on action and combat and has a more well defined and multi-tiered progression system than Minecraft, though I think if you enjoy one game you'll probably enjoy the other."

This game has shaped who i am it showed me what true dedication, the ability to create your own goals and focus on them until it's completion. This game not only fun with just yourself but with massive groups for friends. Mods can extend the game further and further, but making mods isn't only form of creativity in this game. Terraria has all sorts of clothes that you can design your character, plus with thousands of different blocks that you can use to make buildings with.
Terraria is one of the best video games that i have played and the i would defiantly recommend it to anyone who is planning to get it.

3431,"HOW IS TERRARIA ONLY 10 DOLLARS???????????????????

(if you don't want to read my rant, skip to the bottom for a summary, I won't blame you if you skip, it's pretty boring.)

Terraria is an amazing game that is worth well over 10 dollars, at least 25 in my opinion. There is so many things to do, explore, fight bosses, build, craft, and mine. You can also download mods, which make the game even better somehow. 
There is a variety of styles to play, for example, you can play on the challenging Expert or Master difficulties, with A.I changes and enemies being much stronger. Or you can play on the relaxing, (Or living hell) Journey difficulty, which starts you out with better gear and being able to research items to duplicate them as much as you want, as well as godlike powers, including changing the weather, time, difficulty, monster spawns, etc.
There is also 4 main 'classes', each one has it's own unique traits and gameplay, every class is described here in no particular order: 
Melee, the most standard class, uses close range weapons, like swords and maces, due to this, melee has higher defense than all other classes, although when you reach a certain progress point, the melee class becomes mostly based off of swords shooting projectiles, but the defense remains, therefore melee is objectively the easiest class.
The second class is the Mage class, a mage uses magic weapons, like staffs and spells, that excel in almost every way, they are very good at controlling crowds of enemies and have high damage. The drawback to this is, using magic weapons costs Mana, which can be replenished by potions and regenerating it naturally, the Mage class is mostly about conserving and regenerating Mana, causing it to be on the more complex side.
The most simple class in my opinion is the ranger class, a ranger uses weapons such as bows and guns, they can also use throwing weapons such as grenades and knives, the ranger class requires farming for ammo to shoot your weapons, the ammo types are diverse, some home, some pierce, some give enemies debuffs, some bounce, and some are just normal straight shots. The gun types also differ, some being fully auto, and others being semi auto, some shoot differently than others, like shooting multiple bullets at once, or shooting other projectiles, that after a delay, shoot bullets toward the cursor. All in all, the ranger class is a fun one.
And finally the last class, Summoner, Summoners summon creatures such as imps and spiders, even other things like dragons or magic swords, as well as using summons, they use whips which enhance your ability to deal damage, such as increasing whip speed or summoning an extra projectile on hit with enemies, or just directly increasing how much damage your summons do, Summoner is the most complex class in my opinion, but also very fun.


SUMMARY HERE:
Terraria is a very very fun game that highly focuses on combat and exploration, it has lots of customization options, leading it to be a very fun game in general.

3449,"I played other games of this genre, and I have to admit... the start is way too boring and way too hard. The usual cycle of 'go find better gear, to delve deeper, to get even better gear' is marred by the first tiers of weapons feeling like wet paper under the barrage of monsters that can jump over you and kill you in just some hits.

Plus, crafting materials cost way too much, three to five ores to make a bar, sure. but to make a full set, you need something akin to fifty bars and more, while most veins will give you... one bar if you're lucky. Plus, some bosses require you to sacrifice materials that, by then, still insanely rare to get, and you won't progress until you kill them. Having to go to an npc for them to explain to you what you can do with x materials is cute on paper, but in reality everyone will just go to the wiki... which shouldn't happen."

Even if there's something you don't like about the game, there's a mod for that. Don't like a recipe? There's a mod for that. Want more content? There's a mod for that. Want to endlessly grind, or minimize the grind as much as possible? There's mods for that, too. This game is a top-tier 10/10 in my books, with 1,000 hours in Terraria and 300 in Tmodloader, I can say with 100% certainty that this game is a great way to burn many, many hours of your time when you're bored, especially for its price.

3490,"I've been playing this game on and off for the past 10ish years. I have a had fun playing multiplayer with my friends. However, most fun comes from the solo play. The game can feel ""stale"" unless you actually progress through it. Then at end game youre like what do now? Thats when you can make a new world and start over but at an advantage with your current character OR keep on keeping on and get into building bases and perfecting boss ""arenas"", you can farm whatever loot you need. Overall, Terraria is a great game that has brought me many hours of fun."

3529,"Obviously people are gonna compare this to minecraft first, so, starting off frm there, here's the rub: much deepr mechanics, much better combat.

Feels  a bit weird to control at first, but feels amazing noce you gey the hang of it.

Music is divine.

YOu cna make it as zen of an experience or just as heptic of one as you prefer.

Haven't really playe dmuch because I got scared by how much there is to learn to reach ful completion, but I found a friend who might help me play on the usual.

One of the iconic but often oerlooked 10/10s of the indie revolution, up there with Undertale, Fez and Pyre as far as the Inovation category goes.

It did the whole survival thing before it was a fad, and it's not the only thing it has going for it by far."
3530,"pretty cool game, has alot of features, can make beautiful buildings, it is everything i want, for example fighting, classes, bosses, and cool weapons"
3531,"Great game honestly, so much to it, if you love Minecraft, survival games or games in general, you will love this game! Theres something in it for everyone! If you havent already i recommend you try it. I like beans"

3542,yes
3543,"A very good game that i have played for 6 years. This game can be somewhat buggy, but i think that's something that makes it fun. The amount of building oppurtunity, along with the weapons and tools is incredible. Terraria is a game that i will always love. Definite recommendation."
3544,Good game
3545,One of the best games ever created
3546,"absolute banger game, if u dont like it, play another class, get tmodloader or get gud
"
3547,"How have I never recommended this game? Well, it's obvious at this point that this game is incredible. I still cannot believe it's only $10 and they've never charged for a single update (which I would have paid for). Just...truly incredible. I'm sure a big part of the reason they're able to do that is because of the overwhelming success. But, still. This is still one of my favorite games of all time. I just recently replayed it in Journey mode and it was like coming back to an old friend. What a beautiful, wonderful experience. I wish I could erase my memory and experience it from scratch all over again.

The tier-crafting system is still my favorite in any game ever and a huge inspiration to ideas for my own game one day."

3566,"Truly the greatest game of all time. Terraria made my childhood, and if you stick with it through the early stages, I promise you'll love it. Expert and Master mode are available for those who want a little more challenge (at the cost of making the game a little more grindy,) but on Normal and Journey mode the game maintains difficulty without feeling unbalanced."

3591,Nice
3592,it is a game that you play
3593,"Great game! I think there should be a bit more guidance in game as I felt when I was learning that I had to go to the wiki nearly every 20 minutes when starting out, but after the first playthrough it obviously went much more smoothly. 
You guys should add a 'kill a boss' guide/tutorial which will give you 'quests' or something to get to the point where King Slime is defeated (ie. get furnace, get anvil, get armor, get crown, get slime crown etc, build campfire)"
3594,"good game

3596,one of the greatest games i hae ever played in my life. have been playing for almost three years and its amazing
3597,"much good
"
3598,i love it
3599,"MUST BUY!
Terraria is honestly one of the best game I have bought. In case you can't buy Minecraft or can't then this game is the perfect option for you!
BUT! Don't see Terraria as a Minecraft Game, see it as it's own Idea!
Another good thing is that low-end Devices can handle Terraria (MacBook, in my case)
You can play it on nearly every Platform too!
So, in total:
Worth Buying? Yes, it is.
Good Graphics? It does have that.
Fun Gameplay? Alot of it!
I hope I could convince you to buying this game, as you should!"
3600,okay
3601,"insane multiplayer game cool bosses/moosic and i just enjoy toying with friends in the game itself

3602,"i took a shit in minecraft, then hardcore existed. took a shit in terraria, and nothing changed.

3605,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

"
3622,People often compare Minecraft and Terraria a lot. To each their own and both have a special place in my heart since they came out. Terraria will always have lots of hours to put in without being bored and you can always come back to it later. 9/10
3623,cool block game
3624,Ver Nice and chool
3625,game that is a game indeed yes yes
3626,you can pet the dog (and cat)
3627,"i, like probably a majority of people, have had this game since they were eleven or something and could never figure out what to do. however, returning to it with friends has been one of my favorite gaming experiences. i can't stress enough how much fun this game is with friends. seriously, have a single other friend with this game. music slaps as well, but I don't think you needed me to tell you that.

but most of all, 
lmao, ej, you truly thought you were gonna get supreme helper minion before me, get squiggled"
3628,Fun with friends.
3629,unable to hate this game

3646,good
3647,I love this game. I cannot express how much fun this is. After you get past the 2D (although even that is part of why I love it!) you can't stop playing :)
3648,"I LOVE IT!!

3649,the hour counter is a lie i have thousands on another account and it is a d d i c t i n g

3652,"Trust me its better than it looks. Provides countless hours of gameplay, even replaying is not boring after some time. Great soundtrack, great vibes, overall a well standing game that will not get boring for so many years."

3658,"This should have a concrete spot in the Gaming Hall Of Fame. Re-Logic is a development company that others could learn from.

The community behind Terraria is just as fantastic as the game itself."
3659,AMAZING GAME!! Wouldn't change a thing
3660,"This Game Is A Fantastic Mix Of Sand Box Building And Combat Al-tho I Find The Bosses After Playing Calamity A Little Easy There Still Fun And interesting.

I Also Recommend Playing Mods After A Few Play Troughs Of Terraria As They Spice Things Up And Make The Game New And Fresh.

Also Sand Is Broken"

3669,"this is a classic childhood game for me, and after messing with a few world transfers from my phone (did you know .world files and .wld files arent the same? and that updating the game will fix that?), i was able to get back all my old memories and gear. to say i was over the moon is an understatement. 
but just playing this again, with all the new additions (i stopped playing before journey's end) is fantastic. seeing all this, it brings me back (also, the seraphim set has an interesting designer.)
hope they do the cross platform fix like they said they would. on;ly thing holding this down for me

love this game, thank you devs"

3675,0uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
3676,"My reason to why other people should play this game is because that it is great for people who have a taste of adventure, hard work, and y'know.. Grinding. Basically, you sell your soul to this game or not. (P.S, I already sold my soul. please send help)"
3677,My 306 hours is a lie. I've played this game for hundreds more hours offline. Great game.

3707,yes

3709,"definitely worth a try, for the price its an absolute steal for the amount of content that is available, the repeatability is amazing due to the distinct classes you can play as, mage , summoner , melee or ranger and even more if you count any sub classes. overall the game is just phenomenal with great game progression and also tons of great mods available such as calamity for when you feel like changing the game up a bit."

Awesome bosses, armor and weapons, it could use some more customization for weapons though. Amazing controls, there should be an Eye of Cthulhu mount and a eater of worlds mount. 4.8 stars"

Fuck the fishing achievement, though. At least I don't have to do it again now that I've gotten all of the achievements."
3758,very epic
3759,Probably one of the most fun games you will ever play. The progression system is so rewarding and the game can be incredibly difficult or easy peasy completely depending on how well you prepare for the next challenge.
3760,very cool.

3782,"A game so hard that can ruin relationships , whole countries , maybe even continents , a game that will transform you from a gamer to a certified grinder, a game that will emerge you into itself and extract you from the real world at some point you cant even see the difference between life and terraria its coming for you and it will devour you... 10/10 I love it"

3894,"Ever since launch back in 2011, it's been extremely consistent with updates, good content, and dedication, even if 1.4 was to be the last update, you can't just simply walk away from this masterpiece of a game."
3895,good
3896,"I recently saw this game on the steam store and I remembered how much i used to play it on my old xbox 360 so I bought it and ran through the game a couple times and loved it. It is sad that 1.14 was the last real big update for the game it is still a fun game and will always be in my heart. The only thing i can say is how much i want to commit manslaughter against the fucking bats. Every single time i go into a cave. Boom. a bat come and rapes you from the behind and knocks you down.

Aside from that I highly recommend."

3908,This game is an awesome time sink. I can waste hours playing. Everything about this game has been positive for me. It is extremely stable. It operates well on my old gaming PC. The graphics are nostalgic and beautiful. Would recommend to anyone who likes retro games and gameplay that is similar to Minecraft. (but superior imo)
3909,A very fun sandbox game

3929,very good
3930,"its just great, kinda like minecraft, but SO much bigger, I've played minecraft so many years and i kinda just know everything, but this game is so BIG in comparison, so to sum it up, its awesome, and (unlike minecraft) you can play it for years, and still be finding out new things about it"
3931,"Very difficult, very fun!"
3932,if you've never played before there's a lot to learn but its super fun and you should just get it it's literally amazing
3933,"amazing game, fun bosses, cool areas. it starts off a bit boring but there will be more cool stuff the more you progress. even when you beat the game, there are tons of post game items to get. it is definitely one of my favorite games. the only problem is that some items are locked behind extremely low drop rates, such as the biome keys and rod of discord. other than that, it is an excellent game and definitely worth the money."
3934,yes
3935,doesnt work for old devices and it s fucked up for starters. luckilly i am not a starter
3936,good
3937,"absolutely addicted, god tier game"
3938,.
3939,"I like it
"
3940,"I'd be hard pressed to believe you haven't heard of this game. Question is, should you play it in its current state? Well, yes and no...

The game is fun, there is a LOT you can do in this game. If you like Minecraft, I highly recommend this game to you. You will enjoy it just as much as Minecraft, maybe even more. It's just different... There's a reason Terraria recommends Minecraft and vice versa.

The only thing about this game that might not be enjoyable to some is its difficulty and how ""lost"" you can feel. There's only so much you can do pre-hard mode... What is hard mode? Well, you beat this boss in literal hell and then the game ""advances"" too hard mode where enemies are harder, new things spawn and whole sections of your world change. It can be pretty overwhelming and takes a lot of time to get used to, but if you feel like dumping a lot of hours into this game so you can feel like an overpowered god this is right for you.

I highly suggest at least giving the game a try. The developers really care about this game and continue to update it with new and fun things to do. The games price is also a lot better than games you'll see these days. And I even got the game on sale and let me tell you I'd pay full price for it. In fact, I have on Xbox One. The game is cheap, fun and has so much you can do in it I highly doubt you'll do everything there is to do in the game."
3941,Shit game. 0/10
3942,"This is an amazing game! Although ive not played to long compared to many people, ive really enjoyed it!"
3943,Tbh it didn't seem like it would be suoer good.... But it's literally amazing. It competes well with minecraft.

3964,"I respect that the statement, ""like minecraft, but better"" can take one back a fair and can be quite a hard thing to believe, I was there. However, once you watch a quick video on how to start and play terraria for more than a couple minutes you will come to believe the statement ""like minecraft, but better"". It just takes time.

4007,"To those who think this is anything like Minecraft. Don't take this the wrong way, but you are completely wrong. It is so much more than Minecraft. It has tons and tons of, well, everything! Accessories, weapons, food, you name it! I really want you to play this game no matter what. It is one of the best RPG/Sandbox games out there and I highly suggest this if you're looking for something to play. I've spent several hundred hours on this game, and I'm telling you, it is one of the best experiences out there. So please get Terraria! It's really good for only the price of 10 smackaroonies!"

This game has bought me entertainment for years, and I wish there was more I could do as a long-time fan to show my appreciation for the achievement that this game is. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have, and I hope you have a fantastic day!"

4025,"I love this game SO much. The game progression is very smooth. You make one weapon and set of armor, immediately you can see the next goal and know what to do. Which, there is ALWAYS something to do. The building allows for creative builds. The grind for drops and such can be irritating (*cough cough* fishing), but is SO rewarding when you get what you are looking for. Combat and classes are perfect, with balanced bosses and weapons. Multiplayer is very fun, with little lag at all and allowing for great co-op play.
Truly one of the best games of all time. Love it."

4033,Peak
4034,yes
4035,I'm disappointed if you don't already know this game is good.
4036,"It's fun, until it gets to the boss that activates Hardmode (an actual thing). It just kind of ruins the game in my opinion. I would be fine with the game just getting harder, like just higher health/damage bosses. But in the game's Hardmode (which is inevitable, regardless of difficulty), there's a thing called The Hallow. And The Hallow is very very annoying in my opinion. It slowly corrupts everything, turning it into a mess (and making you miss out on some content), unless you do a very long and boring process.

But, other people seem to love this game, so maybe you will to."
4037,"One of the best games ever made, hands down."

4049,"Terraria is a open world 2D game with a fun and unique twist. You can play the game and mine and mine to your hearts content but you will never have better armor then the armor and weapons you can get from bosses. Their are many different play styles, if you like being close up to your enemies their are a wide array of options to pick from. Their is also different armor sets that can complement your play style. Over all it is a great game that I would definitely recommend to all types of Gamers."

4052,Fun Indie game to play if you're looking for an intricate 2D MineCraft.
4053,good game
4054,"Massively open world and there are a lot to explore. Terraria has cool Easter eggs, interesting artwork and a general feeling of either calm or when you pick master mode a feeling of wanting to rip your soul out."
4055,"After about 30 hours the gameplay loop, grind and RNG become boring, which is a shame because the end game content is cool, there's just too much filler to get to it. I'd like a condensed version of this game with less grinding and repetative tasks. Inventory management is a total headache, mods can help though."

I certainly have more fun playing Terraria than playing Minecraft, if I'm being honest, since people commonly compare the two games - though honestly they're remarkably different so I don't know if it's really that fair of a comparison.

Terraria suits my tastes better than Minecraft, is what I'll say, as that seems fairer."

I would never sell this game, for the cost its worth it, if it was $40 on steam I would still get it cause its just so good.

Game play: 10/10 Graphics: 9.5/10 (Pixel games are just better) Cost: 10/10 Availability (pc, console, mobile): 10/10. 
Overall: 9.9/10 (not 10/10 cause not the best graphics but I like pixel games)"

"
4178,"Game is amazing, funnest game ever
"
4179,shit
4180,guud
4181,Good Game I played this like 79.9 hours
4182,I'm always looking for excuses to play this game again.
4183,i swear this music has something in it that literally makes me lose track of time and it becomes 4 am.
4184,"very epic, i love it, played it on xbox but xbox broke."
4185,good game
4186,"I love the game and have many hours on mobile, it's kinda boring but that's just me. The different progression, classes, bosses and weird farms are cool."
4187,"you never can go wrong with Terraria. Its a nice, chill game when you want it to be, and a fun, intense game when it needs to be, too. after my very long experience with this game, i never ran out of things to do. from building nice, simple houses for your NPCs, to prisons for your NPCs, (play how you want i guess) to great, big, and stylish ones, the great bosses, enemies, and vast array of weapons and armor really make this game shine. The art style is amazing, too. like i said. you can never go wrong with this game."
4188,Terraria
4189,yep
4190,deez
4191,Terraria is a really really good game because it's Judy there's a whole bunch of bosses to defeat and exploration
4192,Cringe
4193,Fun
4194,fun
4195,It's not just 2D Minecraft.  It's loads better.  Worth every cent.
4196,I thought it was minecraft
4197,I thought this was Minecraft
4198,The fact that I have over a thousand hours on this game should say enough.
4199,"I love Terraria bc it makes my pp hard
"
4200,"yeah man
"
4201,better with mods
4202,"op game
"
4203,nice
4204,In all my years of playing this silly game it never gets old! Always a good time with friends to enjoy. Wish ocram would be able to find his way in as well as dragon armor from the xbox 360 and old mobile version. Aside from that still manages to be a joy to play! 9.5/10!
4205,good
4206,i live this game and play it alot so i hope you like it
4207,yes
4208,peak
4209,"I'm in love with this game right now, just buy it and play it please. Only if you want a game to grind."
4210,buy it please you can set up a killer yo-yo deck
4211,"Terraria is a beautiful game. It has provided me hours of escape and enjoyment. Can't wait for Terraria 2. But I really can wait, because I know its alot."
4212,Amazing game!!!
4213,pretty neat
4214,yes
4215,"This game is so good. At first I was expecting 2D minecraft, and that would be totally fine, but it's a lot more game and a lot less sandbox than minecraft. Either way, 10/10 would recommend."
4216,"This is a really fun game, and is addicting to play. Sure, you might rage quit because of that one boss, but you can always bully the people in the towns you make! And make time consuming castles! And those difficult to make stairs... But anyways, yes, you should play this. It is worth it."
4217,"STOP COMPARING THIS TO MINECRAFT! Yes its pixilated and yes you dig and craft, but im sick of the minecraft comparisons.  you want bossfights and tons of of different weapons, get Terraria. You want a more chill sandbox game with infinite creative possibilities, get minecraft. in the end this is an amazing game and the dev has added so much to it since it first came out."
4218,Good gam
4219,idk what to say i like the game
4220,cool
4221,good
4222,"This game hits all the right notes, Building, Crafting, Exploring, Fighting, Surviving, and much much more. Wanna hang out with friends or maybe prank them? Multiplayer is calling your name. Feeling a little more independent? Check out Single player. Wanna do your own thing without the worry of enemies? Journey Mode with let you sore. And for all the players that like a challenge, Hard mode with send you on a wild ride. In a game with infinite possibilities, you're in a world of infinite fun!!"

4235,very good
4236,"amazing game 10/10, fun times"
4237,epic game
4238,"This game offers so much to the player that its impossible to be done with the game. The numerous mods, items, bosses, enemies, and building options prevent everyone from saying they did everything. This game offers such a good gameplay and visual setup, the game is a 2D pixel game and yet it give such good graphics."
4239,good game
4240,When you accidentally press b ü§°
4241,"AWESOME game, but a respawn timer in single player? What even? How has this game been out a decade but this 'feature' is still included?"
4242,"if you like minecraft you'll probably like terraria, play it through vanilla, then grab tmodloader and try the mods to add entire new levels of complexity."
4243,terraria is an amazing game
4244,Pretty fun. Very much enjoyed.
4245,Better than minecraft ong
4246,Best game I played especially with mods. I easily got over 900 hours (tmodloader included) on this game because it was just so good.

4346,gud game ver fun
4347,"I have spent a day or so playing this game, and its amazing. if you want a fun, semi-challenging game, I can't recommend this enough. If you have a group of friends to play this with, even better. Plus the fishing in this game is pretty pog.

Signed: Still a fishing addict.
P.S. I still don't have any issues, you do if you don't like the fishing!"
4348,this game molested me as a kid and i play it out of spite cause only me get to touch my pee pee 10/10 wouldnt play again
4349,"Minecraft
But 2D
With more monsters just incase defeating the ender dragon wasn't enough.
More than just diamonds!
Music is more funky compared to Minecraft's more calmer approach (love both in their own ways)."

4352,"i love this game
"
4353,bad without waifu workshop item
4354,Slow and boring at the start but gets really good on hardmode
4355,Yes
4356,"I've played this game for awhile. Loved Vanilla, tried modded and enjoyed some well renowned mods through multiple playthroughs, and even enjoyed quite a few challenge runs including each class/limited weapons, Upside down, builder only etc. I enjoy other games, but i still find myself coming back to it all the time, be it with friends or by myself, sometimes for new personal challenges, but mainly to just relax. 

The only problem I have is that with the update 1.4, I don't know what changed, but I just don't enjoy it as much. There's plenty of new content that changes the game, mostly for the better, and I still enjoy it and come back from time to time, but its just not the same."
4357,"if you like the game minecraft then you will like this game. personally i think this game is a little bit better than minecraft simply because when you hold a torch the light comes with you, i also like the fact that there is more inventory room and more components and monsters than minecraft. for some reason this game reminds me of a mix between minecraft and stardew valley in the sense that you have villiagers and such."
4358,"Good Game, fishing sucks tho crafting the cellphone was pure suffering"
4359,It Good
4360,FUN
4361,"Terraria is a very addicting game. Much like Minecraft, you build, dig, and explore. Mining in Terraria is so much fun and relaxing at the same time. I'm always finding myself mining for hours and enjoying every moment of it. Whenever I find a chest, I get excited because I wonder what could be inside of them. The soundtrack in this game is incredible. It gets stuck in your head after awhile because it's so catchy and chill."
4362,better than minecraft
4363,pretty fun

4502,"Sticky Toffee Pudding 

Ingredients
For the pudding
225g whole medjool dates
175ml boiling water
1 tsp vanilla extract
175g self-raising flour, plus extra for greasing
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
2 eggs
85g butter, softened, plus extra for greasing
140g demerara sugar
2 tbsp black treacle
100ml milk
cream or custard to serve (optional)
For the toffee sauce
175g light muscovado sugar
50g butter, cut into pieces
225ml double cream
1 tbsp black treacle
Method
STEP 1
Stone and chop 225g medjool dates quite small, put them in a bowl, then pour over 175ml boiling water.

STEP 2
Leave for about 30 mins until cool and well-soaked, then mash a bit with a fork. Stir in 1 tsp vanilla extract.

STEP 3
Butter and flour seven mini pudding tins (each about 200ml/7fl oz) and sit them on a baking sheet. Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4.

STEP 4
While the dates are soaking, make the puddings. Mix 175g self-raising flour and 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda together and beat the 2 eggs in a separate bowl.

STEP 5
Beat 85g softened butter and 140g demerara sugar together in a large bowl for a few mins until slightly creamy (the mixture will be grainy from the sugar). Add the eggs a little at a time, beating well between additions.

STEP 6
Beat in 2 tbsp black treacle then, using a large metal spoon, gently fold in one-third of the flour and bicarbonate of soda mix, then half of the 100ml milk, being careful not to overbeat. Repeat until all the flour mix and all the milk is used.

STEP 7
Stir the soaked dates into the pudding batter. The mix may look a little curdled at this point and will be like a soft, thick batter.

STEP 8
Spoon it evenly between the tins and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen and firm.

STEP 9
Meanwhile, put the 175g light muscovado sugar and 50g butter pieces for the sauce in a medium saucepan with half the 225ml double cream.

STEP 10
Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar has completely dissolved.

STEP 11
Stir in 1 tbsp black treacle, turn up the heat slightly and let the mixture bubble away for 2-3 mins until it is a rich toffee colour, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn‚Äôt burn. Take the pan off the heat and beat in the rest of the double cream.

STEP 12
Remove the puddings from the oven. Leave in the tins for a few mins, then loosen them well from the sides of the tins with a small palette knife before turning them out.

STEP 13
You can serve them now with the sauce drizzled over, but they‚Äôll be even stickier if left for a day or two coated in the sauce. To do this, pour about half the sauce into one or two ovenproof serving dishes.

STEP 14
Sit the upturned puddings on the sauce, then pour the rest of the sauce over them. Cover with a loose tent of foil so that the sauce doesn‚Äôt smudge (no need to chill).

STEP 15
When ready to serve, heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Warm the puddings through, still covered, for 15-20 mins or until the sauce is bubbling. Serve them on their own, or with cream or custard."
4503,"If you love sandbox games with an objective then this is definetly the game for you!!
The satisfaction of building up your character is so..well, satisfying that it keeps making me come back each and everytime, trying out something different, building something different each playthrough i do.
Or just keep things the same, thats cool too.
It is a great experience some people might miss out on!
However if its not your type of game, thats okay, you tried atleast.
But i really do recommend giving the game a genuine go if you really like to do bosses, building, and farming (the mob kind) and building up your character to be something incredible!

Sincerily ""Help i have too many hours in this game and it keeps growing""
"

4637,good
4638,"Picked this game up in 2011. I remember it taking a little to understand why it was fun but the second I did I fell in love, and it's only gotten substantially better over time.

Terraria is a near-perfect game forumla. In the same way that there will never be another World of Warcraft, there will never be another Terraria.

I look forward to every new play through. If you're thinking about picking it up, don't hesitate - it may be the highest value per dollar game ever made. Bring friends!"

4684,"As you can tell I have put a good number of hours into Terraria, probably more will be poured into it as I am typing. I am hooked on this game and learned so much that it has enhanced every single play-through I have had and the number of guides and the wiki makes it even easier to find what you need help with. I can whole-heartedly say that Terraria is much easier to get into than Minecraft another game I poured a good amount of hours into and simply removing the Z-axis has made this game less intimidating in MC am always getting lost because the world is just too huge and you'll be wandering aimlessly. In Terraria the game starts you off with a copper sword, ax, and pick-ax with you wanting to upgrade your tools really making this game feel like a Metroidvania. The accessories really are a plus with equipment that can make you run faster and negate fall damage outright you can really make the world into your play-thing. But with a world what are the dangers within, that's where the bosses come in monsters that will kill an unsuspecting player the first time around which will drive you even more into getting more powerful so you can obliterate your enemies and with the healthy amount of events sprinkled about this game will keep you on your toes with blood-moons that causes the undead the be relentless and goblins trying the raid your village there is so much I can talk about but I have to end this somewhere. So I highly recommend you purchase this game for yourself and give it a shot because this review has bearly scratched the surface of this gem of a game, thanks for reading."

Really flexible options on picking the player class as you are not constrained by the game itself - just by your ability to obtain required tools, armour and other class-related items, like yo-yo, swords, bows, throwables etc. 
The 2D aesthetics is really pleasant and sprites definitely seems to be a natural part of the world.
Top game of the genre!"

Fast forward 10 to 30 hours, and I started to forget about life.

Fast forward 50 hours and I forgot who I was and is so immersed in this game :D

10/10 would recommend this game to anyone. Beginners to advanced gamers, young to old and anyone in between. Want a relaxing game to decompress? = TERRARIA... Want a game so challenging and difficult you just wanna give up? = TERRARIA

Incredibly easy and challenging at the same time and great price tag. Buy this game, you would not be disappointed ;)"

4851,I like this.
4852,"This is one of the ""classics"" for me. Terraria is a sandbox, 2D open world survival craft game, where you progress by defeating enemies, making bases and building houses, and defeating bosses. The progression works within the enemies, and the world by itself. Not only this being extremely and highly moddable, but enjoyable on its own.

You should definitely try Terraria, If you're into:
-RPG-like hack n' slash combat and action
-freedom of what you can do in a randomly-generated world, like terraforming and architechury
-Difficult, yet possible and good challenges within the events that the bosses and enemies provide
-Modding and and extended progression and features within the skilled community
-Good games to grab alone, OR with your friends!"

4870,YES
4871,"I'm almost always a tank/melee main in games, but no matter how many times I play this game I just keep going for the magic build???

This game does so many things right. Infinitely replayable. Fun alone but even better with a friend."
4872,"terraria is a very fun gam fr fr ong ong buy it and play normal terraria for a very fun experience, buy it and play expert or master and go cry to your mommy!  buy the game now before i come to your house! uwu onii chan~"
4873,"You're here looking for reviews you will only find memes, just buy the fucking game, you will NOT regret it. I went to kill a Blue Slime and accidentally summoned the Moon Lord, best game ever."
4874,it is very fun modded and with friends
4875,the bosses randomly despawn like tf fix the game
4876,fun
4877,awesom
4878,Fun
4879,great game
4880,"Honestly just downright astounding. The builds you can make in this game are limited to mostly only your imagination, due to the honestly downright stupid amount of blocks and walls, as well as a varying selection of paint and uncountable numbers of furniture for each material possible to make furniture out of.

10/10 would spend another 300+ hours on again"
4881,"Originally played it on my Xbox a few years ago. Decided to replay it now and its just as good as I remember. Fun to explore the world, fight the bosses, and build nice houses for all your NPCs. Solidly recommend."
4882,great game
4883,very cool yes
4884,pretty nice
4885,good pixels 9/10 cause of only 1 soundtrack

4902,"Funny game, would play again."
4903,"So much love and care has been put into Terraria over the years, and it's easy to see that. The developers really put their heart and soul into making this game a masterpiece. 10/10 would play again"

4908,not bad.
4909,"I love this game. Although, Master mode could use some early game balancing. A flat damage and HP increase for every enemy makes it very hard at the beginning when you have no mobility or range."
4910,I will never understand the hype on this game
4911,goated game

4916,"good game must have bought on at least four platforms (nintendo ds, oplaystation, mobile, and pc)"
4917,i would recommend it to players who have just come out of the psychic ward because it feels like i just turned my nan into a sofa made by a swedish grandmother who liikes to feast on 5 year olds bunions and enjoys drinking the spit of lithuanian women
4918,"Better than minecraft, still think it ripped off tetris."
4919,"One of the best games I have played, it is definitely worth a try (use the wiki btw)."
4920,"I like that there is much to do in this game. Many bosses hard and easy and multiple strategies to go about defeating them. As well as many creatures. This game also appeals to the creative aspect of things where you can build whatever you'd like with the materials you gather. The art in this game is good, too. Pixels are a style and the developers of Terraria used the pixels well. The game itself is thought through, well, put together, complex but simple at the same time. I myself think it is a masterpiece. I would highly recommend it. I've been playing I don't know how many years. One of my few personal favorites. 
The only thing it doesn't have much of is a story line, but I suppose it's up to you what is happening."
4921,one of the best games ever made. incredible!
4922,great game but after playing for multiple years I am still piss scared of the spider biome

4938,"Along Minecraft, this game was part of a great chunk of my early games.
If you are sick of playing open world crafting games that are promising but unfinished and lacking of polishing, look no further. This game is a masterpiece that is able to keep you entertained for hundreds if not thousands of hours.

This is the only non competitive game that I have put an ungodly amount of time into."
4939,good
4940,First played terraria in 2014 (on ps3) and still find it quite fun so that must say something about the quality of it.
4941,epic game 10/10 would buy. if you like minecraft at all you will love this.
4942,top 5 game
4943,"Yeah this game is actually decent, but you will have a hard time playing as a low level character. Somewhat better than minecraft but not really a comparison because it's not fair!"
4944,Tar Tar is like the best game ever you can play differently every time and its always still a challenge
4945,Fun and painful. beware of the crawdaddies.....

4970,"creative good and colorful, this isnt 2d minecraft though"
4971,"If you love soothing, while exiting, mindless grinding while making progress. If you love dying without any warning, while beeing op. Do you love building or fighting. This is it. 

Some days you think you are just going to get the tiny piece of ore, and then go back and craft. 8 hours later you realise your inventory is overfull and you still don't want to return home because it will take forever to go back to where you were."

4978,Possibly the best sandbox open world game i've evhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/#er played.
4979,poggies game
4980,"I have played this more than 1000 hours and i can confirm that this is a banger game, modded or not you are sure to have fun. Progression is a bit slow in the start but once you get going and know what do to it becomes really fun to challenge all the bosses at your own pace. This game can challenge you, be easy or unleash your creativity to the best . There is a difficulty for everyone and modded can really give you a challenge but it does not have to be like that, in this game there is something for everyone adults and kids alike. Would buy again 10/10"

4987,"great game! I would recommend this game for 14 to 19 year olds for a challenge
"
4988,"Extremely fun game, and once you are done you can use T-Mod loader. Tons of content and bosses, achievments and hidden secrets to discover

(Ignore my play time it bugged, I have played far over 500 hours)"
4989,very nice !
4990,"Terraria is without a doubt one of the best adventure games out there, mainly because it has a lot of content to give, such as bosses to defeat, items to obtain, and abilities to unlock; something that stands out from other games is that it allows you to completely modify the environment to your liking; the gameplay is good although it is not that advanced, the soundtrack surprises with extraordinary songs in each part of the game, and finally, the story is not continuous, so in an open world like this it is exciting to discover everything that one can because there are many things to do, in short, an excellent game and I recommend it."
4991,worth putting time into
4992,gamer game very fun
4993,"Great Game, great soundtrack"
4994,epic
4995,nice
4996,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
4997,"I enjoy large men inside of my behind :)

5013,"I bought this game when it was on sale, I got recomendation from my friend to play this game. For first time I thought I will pirate it, but when I saw it was on sale I donated my money and bought and ohhh man I wasn't wrong. This game is so fantastic! I played this game A LOT and I know almost all about it. Actually I bought this game before 1.4 released and this is good! Sadly that this game will not update (maybe, idk) but I glad that I played this game.
Result : 10/10"

5031,good game. Makes me feel goofy and funball. i once ate borgor.
5032,i would most definitely recommend this game to someone because it has so many things you can do inside it and its very similar to minecraft if you like that game at least. It also has its own unique gaming style and so many different weapons you can craft. Try it out and you might like it.
5033,its alright for a bit I guess
5034,very intresting
5035,"I would really recommend this game. I have played on 350 hours and i enjoyed it every day i play it. Although i wouldn't recommend for young children as there is a blood and gore setting but it can be disabled. I loved it so much because it has a huge choice of how you can customize  your character and how you play this character and also how you can customize worlds as well. I would definitly recommend this game from years 7 up.
I hope you find this helpful to the people who are trying to find the perfect game."
5036,terrirrreria is an experience that is unlike any other play the game it fun because you get to destroy funny gient haha worm with the most insane weapons like a dolphin machine gun thats shoots bullets made with the remains of an eldritch god

The game is amazing without mods, but it is so easy to mod, and there are some great ones out there! If you are on-the-edge about buying the game, I would just do it.

5071,"religion and politics often make some people lose all perspective and give way to ranting and raging and carrying on like emotional children who refuse to discuss it with reason or else they prefer argument on that who hate on them which is a hell of a way to conduct a discussion well anyhow not long ago i was talking about the elections and how the campaigns were ignoring the issues and sticking instead to infective and personal crap that had nothing to do with the obvious problems that running a government  which is all true as you know you followed the speeches and so called ""debates"" as a candidate anyhow one of the guys i was talking with said not a word in the whole conversation except at the end when he suddenly chucked and said we were all full of shit and why didnt we go live in russia or china if that was the way we all hated the united states of america next thing you know the whole blooming discussion was more like a brawl and the partakers loosely confessed and the noise was incredible someone said son of a bitch and i think he said bastard i couldnt be sure it was all so confusing well anyhow i was attempting to get it back on an rational level like for example to talk to the one who started it all and i asked what did he mean we were all full of shit was he making a statement of fact as he knew it and where was his documentation to back up his claim i think socrates would have been proud of the way i refuted his argument that is i tried to refute it but all he could offer was all the same about how we were all full of shit but he wouldnt say why he kept on repeating it that and the part about russia and china and communist dupes and ill have to confess that i got a bit angry and told him to stuff all his ideas up his ass which you dont have to tell me is hardly a way to convince anyone in an argument then he got salty and threatened to give me a punch in the mouth if i didnt shut up and i really got mad and the others did too and we all beat the shit 
out of mister conservative and after all he had only insulted me blindly its still a free country and anyone telling a fellow like me brother you're full of shit better be good and ready to answer politely when asked to be scared to say WHYY

5135,cool
5136,"tldr: yea its pretty good

My cousin introduced this game to me way back in 2013 (ish) and I've been playing ever since. I've put more time into this game than any other in my library and I can say it really does have something for everyone; boss fights, exploration, building, complimented by plenty of extremely rewarding progression and beautiful art style, all of which can be experienced with friends. It can run on really any computer and still look and runs fantastic, and along with massive community support and constant updates from the developers (even if their not updating it anymore they still update it.) The only thing I can even really say this game lacks is story (largely because it leans heavily on the fact that it's primarily a sandbox game, so I can't really knock it). But hey, their coming out with a comic book soon, so maybe this game really does have something for everyone."
5137,"Is best with friends
"
5138,i finished the game and i love it moon lord
5139,"This game gave me Minecraft vibes. I really enjoyed the time in my little world. Also, I believe that the game won some great awards such as ""labor of love"" for the continued updates."
5140,gud
5141,SUPER FUN!!!
5142,"I love how this game essentially makes the player want to explore the world in order to get certain items they need to survive or create things. I also love how easy it is to set up a game with your friends! The $14.99 is very worth it! In addition, you can even customize certain buildings for yourself or NPCS. This is such an underrated game, and deserves more attention."
5143,really enjoyable game
5144,good game play

5153,sad
5154,"When I first got the game it was frustrating because progression was not easy for me to figure out. Use the wiki, it will change your life. This is an amazing game to play."
5155,This is one of my most favorite games up there with BOTW (Breath of the Wild). I loved the graphics the movement and the challenge. I find this the most absorbing games I have ever played.If you wonder if you should but this look at Minecraft and other sandbox games like this one. Once again I say that if you like games buy this! I hope you have as much fun as I have. :)
5156,This game is great and you can literally create anything your mind can think of. Thanks for making such an entertaining game and for the bond it helped flourish between my son and I. I cannot thank the developers enough!

5224,"This isn't minecraft but 2d, its way better, with over 15 bosses and an amazing modding community. This game has 2 stages, hardmode and pre hardmode, with hardmode being enabled in a world with a specific boss defeated. The game leads you to beating the next boss by having random boss spawns if a criteria is met or a specific summon spawns in your world as you explore. It has over 4000 unique items in the game with over 500 weapons. This game is just great for its price."

5244,"[h1] Me and Terraria [/h1]
Although it doesn't show on my Steam Account, I've previously played over 2000 hours on the GoG version of Terraria, and have no regrets. Personally, it's my favourite game ever, and is one of the few games I return to play, several years after I first started playing it. I first booted up the game after downloading it on a sketchy illegal website back in 2013 (probably with more than a few viruses as well), and waiting hours for it to download. Upon first opening it, I had no idea how much I was going to fall in love with the game.

[h1] What is Terraria [/h1]
At it's core Terraria is a 2D open-world sandbox game, which spawns you in a randomly generated world with nothing more than a Copper Shortsword, Pickaxe and Axe, and an NPC called the Guide. On your journey to survive in this world, you'll dig, fight, explore and build, amassing an armada of loot and finding your own way to progress from battling Slimes to beating the Moon Lord.


Terraria itself contains an unbelievable amount of depth and replay value. Even playing the game in the most linear way possible (obtaining better gear and fighting increasingly difficult bosses) there's almost limitless ways to approach every portion of the game, which is in large part due to the sheer range of weapons, tactics and equipment/armour that's available, but is also aided by the randomly generated maps, and the sandbox nature of the game where any and all blocks can be mined or placed.

There's four difficulty modes (as of v1.4.3.6) Journey, Classic, Expert and Master. Each one ramps up the difficulty steeply, but the harder difficulties, Expert and Master make the game more engaging for experienced players, requiring more precise play and more nuanced tactics to complete the game.

In standard Terraria, there are four playable classes of weapons/armour (although there's no restrictions on what you can use), Melee, Ranged, Magic and Summoner, where each one rewards different playstyles, and makes specific points in the game easier or harder.

Did I mention that the game has fully functioning multiplayer as well? You can play with as many or as few players as you want in a world, which creates lasting memories between you and your companions.

[h1] tModLoader [/h1]
However, if you're not convinced, and are worried that you'll ever begin feeling bored of the main game (which I can assure you, will NOT happen quickly), there's a highly active and polished mod-client, tModLoader, with mods ranging from huge content mods which completely remake and extend the game (e.g. Calamity, Thorium) to Quality of Life mods that improve certain features in the game (e.g. Magic Storage, Terraria Overhaul, Improved Multiplayer) to cheat mods which can just completely break the game (Item Randomiser, Hero's Mod, Cheat Sheet). The sheer quality (ignoring Item Randomiser lol) and variety of mods can leave you browsing the tModLoader Workshop for hours on end.

[h1] Summary [/h1]
Personally Terraria is the most engaging game I've ever played, and I've lived through almost half of my life playing it, from Terraria 1.2 in 2013 to Journey's End in 2022, and I'm sure I'll still be playing it for many years to come. An originally great game loving supported and updated by the incredibly dedicated developers at ReLogic for over 12 years now, has made Terraria into a truly one of a kind game, making memories I'll cherish for the rest of my life. I hope in this review (I kept it brief) that I was able to convey my love for the game, and how much of an impact Terraria has played in my life.

5245,best family game ive ever played
5246,once u get zenith the game is 100 times easier

5253,"Terraria is such an amazing game. Whether you love a difficult challenfe, enjoy casual profression, or just want to mess around without a care in the world, this game has you covered. Even if you get bored with Vanilla Terraria, TMod Loader has a plethera of mods to choose from. Ranging from quality of life mods, to progression altering major content mods, you can find it for Terraria."

5269,"One of those games I knew was popular but I didn‚Äôt really pay any attention to it. Steam recommended it to me for maybe fifty times because I played similar games, so I finally bought it on sale. Tried it and didn‚Äôt hate it, but I told myself that if I wanted to play a crafting game, I‚Äôd rather do it with one that looked good. 3 years later I replayed some games for achievements because I had nothing new to play and that is when I finally gave this game a real chance. A great game when you take the time to appreciate it, it‚Äôs really more complex and bigger than I first though. I played solo and I had a blast, that‚Äôs all I could think about for a couple of weeks. It‚Äôs probably a nice experience and an easier one in co-op for people who prefer playing with friends."

5282,I played this for 20 hours and still have no clue what 90% of the things in this game are
5283,"(Steam says 8 hours but i have probably 1k on xbox alone)

Many people try to compare the game with minecraft, i`m not going to argue if its similar or not but I want to mention that the style and progression of the game is a lot more complex than minecraft.  with hundreds of more weapons, blocks, and mechanics this game is more like the roguelite cousin of the game,  you are constantly finding upgrades and replacing your tools rather than fixing the same tools durability.

Alot of people try to say the game is too grindy and if you are going for harder difficulties or 100%ing the game then yes it will be extremely grindy, but I think the game is constructed to split up the time you take exploring, mining for loot, building and upgrading houses, and then killing bosses usually in that order, thjis mixed with the hundreds of items in my opinion keeps the game fresh even after serveral runs, and there are different class specific armours and weapons to keep runs different from eachother if thats what you want.
The game also has an extensive community on wikis and steam workshop."

It has so many different bosses and leaves to beat; me and my boyfriend have been playing for 25.6 hours and still haven't barely scratched the surface of all the things to offer. This game offers multiple levels of difficulties with items to unlock for each one, including bosses and many enemy's to kill! my favorite thing is probably the 2 ""diseases"" that slowly start spreading towards your base in the game."

5300,"Honestly, One of the best games of all time, right along with minecraft. It has its own style, and the replayability in this game, id say, is way more than minecraft. The building isnt the best, since its 2D, but this game plays like minecraft with demons, witches, magic, bosses, trinkets, real progression. All in all, its a game you have to play for yourself to appreciate it"
5301,I liked it. I was good at it.
5302,"It's odd to say a pixelated game has managed to become one of, if not the best, video game of all time. Here we are nonetheless. To preface this, my steam game time is not reflective of my total game time, total it would be around 1900-2000 hours.

Now what makes Terraria so good? Well...many things.

Music. There is a serious argument to be made that Terraria has one of the best music selection in all of gaming. The songs don't adhere to a specific genre, however the best way to describe them as a whole would be electronic orchestral. The primary uses of Music in Terraria are between its biomes, bosses and events. The game has four volumes of music now which have been released through every major update (1.0-1.4). Leaving plenty of music to the point where you're bound to enjoy at least one tune. I seriously believe that without the amazing use of music, Terraria would of never reached the point it is at today.

Artstyle. Terraria's art direction is great, even if limited by the inherent pixelated nature of the game. The developers do a great job making the game look good despite this limitation. I can't act as if pixelation is what makes Terraria game changing however. Pixels are pixels so, visually, they'll always be limitations and many a game look better than Terraria. However, I'm sure the more simple process of game development this way has aided it in pumping out more content so that's a plus. 

Gameplay. THIS is what makes Terraria different. The different playstyles and builds makes interacting with Terraria's abundant worlds so fun, and most importantly replayable. For one, the boss fights in this game are fantastic and challenging as a newbie with many levels of difficulty scaling if you find yourself too beastly for normal mode now. Progression is very rewarding and until the defeat of moonlord, there is ALWAYS something to do. The weapons are interesting and the distinct classes give many ways to go through the game. Overall, there's so many items to chase and ways to play differently that people like myself rack up so much play time.

Perfection? No. Close? Yes. Terraria isn't a perfect game due to its reliance on the wiki. Nothing is fully explained to the player and I believe that has scared many away from the game. This can be as simple as adding a longer tutorial, a more fleshed out guide etc. All is to be said is that you should not miss out on this game.

5313,sick
5314,"2D minecraft but in the most positive way possible. In contrast to procedural generated, building sandbox survival Minecraft; Terraria is 2D sandbox RPG game. Terraria allows the player to choose their playstyle via weapons of varying usage, accessories that change up utility, and armor that can be used as full-sets or combinations for specific results.
Melee: Highest Defense class, items related broadly do strong damage and excel up close.
Range(r): Damage enemies from a distance, utilizing weapons such as guns and bows, which require ammunition. The choice of ammunition can greatly effect results.
Magic: Less defense, using weapons that can home on enemies, regular or controllable projectiles, AOE attacks, etc. The catch is they require mana to use their weapons.
Summoner: Weakest class in the game, but they utilize staffs that summon minions that auto-target enemies or manually target and damage enemies with whips. Many times a person will utilize a non-Summoner weapon when not using a whip to balance out combat while minions assist."

5371,"I've been playing Minecraft since July 2010, so I've seen most major updates for game. The game offers ""Infinite wonders and endless possibilities"" Minecraft isn't actually infinite or endless, but it might as well be due to the large amount of things you can do with the game. My favorite parts of the game are survival and hardcore singleplayer, and survival multiplayer. Minecraft may seem simple at first, but there are a lot of mechanics under the hood and there are ways to manipulate the game in unintended ways. Multiplayer is another big part of Minecraft, where I play on my private servers with friends and family. There are a lot Multiplayer servers, although most are private. My favorite is my private server and 2b2t, the oldest anarchy server in Minecraft is another experience altogether. In summary, Minecraft is a game that is definitely worth a try, and is more than a simple little block game."
5372,"Its just a fantastic game, I have loved it since I started playing it. Just one quick tip: if you keep dying and yo want to give up, DONT GIVE UP! If you keep on going you will achieve greatness."
5373,"YES
"
5374,I like to kill rabbits.10/10
5375,this is a great game of adventure i would recommend this one on PC to get 1.4 (the best version) i really love this game i can't stop playing it!!!

5383,very nice game. me want play forever
5384,"Terraria is incredible, i just got a PC and this is one of the first games I'm playing. I've bought this game 4 times on an ipad when I was 7, my phone and my play station. In total i would easily 1000s of hours in this game because that's what you can do. You beat the game? try it on one of the 3 other classes. you beat it on all the classes? Try a more difficult gamemode. The game boasts hundreds if not THOUSANDS of different items weapons and blocks. Every single part of the world is unique with different biomes horizontally and vertically across the vast 2D world. And every biome contains tons of horrible monsters ores and chests containing loot to progress you further. Another incredible thing is the community countless youtubers creating guides, people writing useful tips and the wiki. One thing you will need is a wiki. i couldn't reccomend this game more for all ages, skill levels and people without as much time grind. PLAY THIS GAME"
5385,"10/10 game. If you haven't played, your life is meaningless."
5386,very fun game

5389,"nice game, many mods to get to enhance it. Build structures, fight bosses, early game is mining sim tho."
5390,2D minecraft without hypixel :(
5391,Slimy balls
5392,"So I've played the game for 745 hours now and I still can't find the words to describe how fun and fantastic it is. After all these years it's simply still worth it to get the game and explore it to the fullest! The higher difficulties bring some new items and challenges which freshen up the experience once you've been through the classic difficulty.

Ofcourse there's also a great community adding to the game with mods, though I haven't really delved into those much myself, but I probably will soon!

Basically, all in all, amazing game, fantastic OST, great creative freedom, adventurous and challenging if you like it to be, 10/10, would (and probably will) spend another 745 hours playing it."
5393,I still haven't even left spawn area and I love this game. Highly recommended.
5394,"A classic in video game experiences.
Obviously not minecraft 2D...
When will be the last update? ehhhh... We don't talk about that ;D"

no i'm not addicted"
5398,"Stocked with content, flexible in it's play style, and still cared for enough even after 10 years that you keep coming back. There's a reason this game is one of the highest rated on Steam."
5399,"Man, i spent part of the time ive played playing with my family and close friends. I had a blast, we struggled at parts, excelled at parts, and finally, finally beat it. It was really incredible. I also bonded with a now pretty close friend over this game, and i find that incredible. Thank you Terraria."
5400,"I have enjoyed every second of this game, down to even the moments i died, well done, well done."
5401,very good
5402,yes
5403,"This game is awesome! It provides such a variety of things to do for different players, tons of amazing content, and lots of hours of exciting gameplay. Would absolutely recommend to people wanting to try it out."

5426,"Terraria is one of those games where to start off just barely better than naked and become someone who slays gods for fun at the end. When you finally defeat the final boss, you will remember how you spent your first night scared in a wooden box, how afraid you were when you fell into an area where you couldn't places torches on walls, how it took you hours upon hours to mine just a small section of the map and then you will reflect on how far you have come, now that you can make entire biomes disappear in minutes, can fly infinitely and even more incredible feats. Truly, one of the best games I have ever played."
5427,"Great game, great progression."
5428,"nice 2D aspect, music is good, boss music sounds very fitting, to well, a boss, the two problems i had is it is pretty hard to find out(in game) how to summon bosses. What i mean is it is hard to figure out that you need to head down the tunnels in the corruption/crimson to find the altar in one of them and make a boss summoning item(that was surprisingly long to write) and the other is if you need to craft something and you don't know how there(at least i don't think there is) is no way of telling but to search it up(once again i mean in game there is a wiki for that. but over all very nice game amazing bosses,same with all the music i like it."

5442,"Terraria! Absolutely legendary among pixelated games. Go from a tiny, weak weapon wielding rookie to a COSMIC MAGIC BLASTING DEMI-GOD. You quite literally work from the ground down, and then up again to get stronger, braver and tougher. Also defend your gradually improving hold on this harsh, dying, struggling world like your life depends on it. Because it does!!"

Peace.  :l   3/5

5480,"Terraria is one of my top games to play. The boss fights are brilliant. The final boss is amazing. The slowly building yourself up until you are basically the equivalent of a GOD is awesome. You have to defend you self from slimes, zombies, literal creatures from HELL and Hard mode. Don't even get me started on hard mode. Once you reach hard mode its like you've restarted the game any monster (besides the once i listed) can and will kill you. I would say more but I don't want to spoil the game anymore. All ill say is play this game!"
5481,idk what to say but its an awesome game
5482,pretty chill game for someone who likes to relax after a long day of work/school. i have enjoyed this game ever since i found it. would recommend 10/10 to people who like adventure games and exploration.

"
5489,"absolute masterpiece of a game. only part that i would call terrible is the conrtoller input/setting controls on controller, are the controllers just meant to be borderline unusable on this game? xbox version has specific button combinations for quick buff, along with the use of quick slect for d-pad. so far all ive noticed is that controller input has little if any support on pc. hopefully the control settings for it are updated soon to bring over current xbox and playstation control schemes."

5506,"Terraria is an awesome game. After spending 350+ hours in terraria and tml combined, I can tell you that the only outdated thing that this game has is its price tag. The game has so much content available for you to enjoy, that even after all the time I have spent playing terraria, I still have tons of content left for me to enjoy and discover. But it makes sense, since it isnt for nothing that this game has sold over  40 million copies.
Terraria is one of the greatest game I have played. And it only costs 5 bucks so... what do you have to lose?"

The sandbox element allows players to branch out and manifest their creativity with a range of materials and blocks at their disposal.

So I already knew the easy ways to beating bosses and stuff. But if you're completely new to the game there will be a learning curve. But you should get it it's super fun. I'm a controller kinda guy myself. Yet I found using mouse and keyboard for pc terraria to be wayyy easier.

5617,Hey at first i thought this would be a boring game and ive been playing it for some time now and its very fun. The first part of terraria isn't that fun but the bosses the preparing you do and messing around you can do with friends is all very fun. The bosses are very challenging especially when you start playing in harder modes and fight more bosses it becomes very hard but this is the most fun ive ever had in a game.
5618,"This game has provided me with countless hours of enjoyment across many platforms. I started playing this game with a few friends about when queen bee was introduced and I used to hate it.

5645,for me this is the best game to play it's fun you can play with you friends and so many things to do in this game i will give it a full star
5646,"often compared to Minecraft due to the blocky aesthetic, but packs tons more features. There's always something to do and the progression between a character and world feels well balanced, so there's never really a time when it seems impossible to survive against the new common monsters and it also doesn't take long to advance onto the next part of the game so it stays interesting. You get hints on where to explore next to lead you to the next boss battles while gaining new, cooler, more powerful equipment along the way. It's the type of game that can be played for hours without becoming dull."

5648,love the game very fun

5657,"An absolutely phenomenal game, no doubt in my mind that when 1.4.4 comes out with all the QoL tweaks known to man this game will be perfect. If you see this and don't own Terraria, do yourself a favor and buy it."

5681,"Terraria has taken 377 hours of my life. And I'm told that's rookie numbers. I've played many different games throughout my years, but I haven't come close to this many hours in any other game. 

I don't know what it is about this game that has caused me to spend so much time on it. It could be the burning desire to upgrade my gear, the many different play styles to choose from, the unique and challenging bosses, the incredibly detailed biomes, or maybe the fact that, as much as they want to, the developers can't seem to stop adding final updates. 

A game so loved by the developers that they are still developing it more than 10 years later is a great sign that it's a game worth playing. Especially for the price of a meal from Wendy's. I actually did the math...this game has cost me just less than 4 cents an hour to play.

The ONLY problem I have is that it requires a little tech knowledge to set up a 24hr server to play with friends on, but it's not too bad. If you are cool with the server running only when the host is on, that is built into the game.

TL:DR - Just buy it. You WILL get your moneys worth. This is probably one of the best and most well-known games for PC in existence, and there are plenty of reasons why.

Developers, a sincere thank you for developing and continuing to support such an amazing game."
5682,"Super fun with frens.

Paranoia inducing schizophrenia with potential strokes if played alone."

5709,"super fun to play with friends and by yourself, story is fun and gameplay is peaceful yet entertaining! Common misconception: terraria has often been called a minecraft ripoff or 2d minecraft but that couldn't be farther from the truth, although they share similar aspects they are completely different games"
5710,I love this Game 100m percent reccomend great worlld loading kloads of content
5711,good
5712,"As the game is at the end of its content updates (unless they decide to pull another fast one on us) all I can tell you is that this game is worth the money and the time. Even back in 1.1, I had logged nearly 400 hours into Terraria; coming back years later after missing a bunch of updates, there's now twice the content there was back then, and it's still a blast with friends. And don't get me started on the mods."

If you bought this game thinking it was just 2d minecraft, You are severely mistaken
The gameplay is pretty good, But the game is pretty challenging
your toaster can probably run it, but it does get quite laggy on old pcs (A newer low end pc/laptop should run it at 60 fps on low settings)
The grind, If you're good enough, You wont need to grind too much, However, If you cant get past a boss, you'll probably need better gear, Best case scenario: You find what you need in a chest or buy it from an NPC, Worst case scenario: FISHING
I havent really seen the lore, But ive heard its pretty good
The price is DEFINETLY worth it, As this game is pretty much infinitely replayable (And if you get bored of the main game, Tmodloader has you covered)
The only bugs ive encountered are slimes clipping through walls but thats pretty much it

10/10, It'll replace your life

5779,alot of content
5780,"Love Terraria, very fun"
5781,"Ahh multiversus, where do we begin? I guess the Npcs! They have deep lore, good cutscenes, and are just a huge game element in general. Next, making money and profesions. profesions allow extra abilities, which can help to make money. making money also isnt complicated at all, you can farm, fish, forage for items, go mining, etc. Honestly, Altho mining and upgrading tools, and watering can get tiresome, there are always scents of reward everywhere. The only things I think it needs is a built-in creative mode, and that kids can grow up bigger than a toddler. Apart from that, it is a wonderful game whit amazing music!"
5782,"this game makes me go yes. this game is so yes, i could

thats all"
5783,amazing game
5784,"When you think about this game it is impossible not to think about a 2D Minecraft, when you first step into the world you see a friendly environment and the first night and steps are played out in a similar way. However, when you keep exploring and discovering, the different biomes, enemies, weapons, accesories, bosses and structures just give out this endless feeling of adventure and uncertainty.

You have to put a lot of hours to fully discover this game. It makes you feel fear when facing the unknown and great accomplishment when you advance through a tough obstacle. These feelings can last for hundreds of hours of gameplay, just for this it deserves a spot in anyone's library, but the actual way to play this game varies so much from person to person AND you can play it with multiple friends too!

In reality, there is no game just like this one, it's wonderful and exciting experience."

5868,FUKIN AMAZIN EH
5869,worth buying
5870,"Other developers: Promise to update their game, never update it.

Terraria developers: Promise to stop updating their game, update it anyways."

5872,Such an amazing game
5873,I want to see empress of light gutted
5874,yes
5875,Queen Slime Bathwater :)
5876,great beautiful game to play alone or with friends
5877,"Quite self explanatory. Terraria has been a successful game from 2011 until today, joining the game and in the first five minutes, starting to have fun that most games nowadays cannot provide. Alike to Minecraft, it is a game of building, demolishing, killing, surviving and in the end, discovering LORE. It's been quite fun."
5878,This game has brought me endless hours of pain and fun. There are always things to do like killing bosses and making beautiful buildings. 10/10

5897,"THIS GAME IS NOT HELLO NEIGHBOR, AND JUST FOR THAT, IT. IS. GARBAGE. ONG"
5898,"Could very well just be a skill issue on my part, but most of the bosses in this game are made with such horribly bad design that it could almost be considered hostile to the new/unprepared. Eater of Worlds is a tunneling boss that makes you summon it from underground leading to you getting stunlocked, Brain of Cthulu teleports INSIDE of you making magic and ranger builds have a needlessly difficult time with them, Wall of Flesh requires that you make a giant pathway across the entirety of Hell that you basically never use again, some gear pieces are impossible to obtain depending on your world seed, and RNG forces you to grind and grind and grind for the random obscure item you need for your build, which is almost always the Emblems. The game gets a lot better and fun with mods or if you fully learn the game, but god, I just can't handle a game being so unbelievably hostile to new players that it genuinely drives both me and my friends away. That said, I will definitely still be playing this game with my buddies that already know the game."
5899,great game 10/10

5906,"For those who want a simple explanation of what Terraria is, it is basically Minecraft but 2-D and more complex (like more items, more bosses, etc.) It is a fun game to play with friends and I do recommend getting it if you are considering it, and if you have friends/family that play it."

5927,"This game is honestly incredible. The bossfights are awesome, the lore is great, the community is cool. This game is just great. It's a bit hard at first to get what's going on, but the wiki helps immensely, and there's always something to do. And there are difficulties for all players, whether you're a casual just goofing around, or a sweat at every game you play. This game with friends is a definite good time, no matter what. This game was worth every penny."

5952,"Terraria is an overrated, grindy mess of a game. The ""exploration"" is tedious and unenjoyable, the combat is simplistic and repetitive, and the crafting is confusing and convoluted. The game is also plagued by constant crashes and bugs. Overall, Terraria is a boring, time-wasting mess, and not worth your time.

5960,"OK, so I'm currently writing this review on a 2 day old account, but trust me when I say I have over 6000 hours on this game. This game is NOT 2D Minecraft. This is by far the best game I've ever played. The amount of love the developers put not only into the game itself, but the community as well. Redigit and all of the other Re-Logic devs are 100% the best game developers out there, because they actually listen to the community, and respond to any suggestions that catch their eye. Whether it be Reddit or Twitter, the devs are constantly listening to people, and specifically adding things the community asks for."

5982,"A very interestingly developed game that offers a lot of gameplay options and gives you the best gaming experience, mostly with its impeccable graphic design and a variety of in-game items, being suitable for both new, more experienced, and even seasoned veteran-type players. I would like to mention that there is currently an unfixed glitch in the game that allows players to see freely through the near landscape below them for a short period and is accessed by going to the video settings and changing your lighting from white to retro. Overall, however, this iconic game is 100% worth your money, time, and even trouble, sorrow, and travail fighting your way through expert and master mode."

6000,Perfect game
6001,"What I really liked about Terraria was mainly the progression, you start out honestly weaker than an infant, but as you progress, kill bosses, find new ores and go into hardmode, you really do begin to not only get a feel for the combat, which is a bit more complex than you might think at first glance, but the later gear you can get is insane, and you really do feel like a powerhouse, and what's best is that the endgame bosses still pose somewhat of a challenge, even when you're all powered up, it never gets too stale. The music and pixel art is all very nice as well, and really do adds to the experience, in my opinion. All this, coupled with the amazing support Terraria has gotten from it's developers throughout the years honestly make this a very fun time to play and one of my personal favorite gaming experiences in recent years. There are flaws as well, of course, but these are minor compared to everything great the game has to offer, and honestly did not tarnish my experience with it. All in all, great game, I'd give it an 8 or even a 9 out of 10."

I give the game 7/10 because, i think the achievement ""Supreme Helper Minion"" is too much, in my opinin 100 is enough. 
An other nice achivement would be kill empress of light on daytime (100% damage at daytime) without using a minecarft in master mode. 
But i still made all the achievements
I wish when you turn on the pvp that the summon would also attack the other player.

I recommend when you play solo, play expert mode.
When aren't solo play master mode.

No add, but i have the keyboard from corsair (K100), when i play Terraria and it is blood moon, the keyboard is red. 
An anther example are you in the hell, she is orange, yellow, orange.
It depends on which biome you are in.
I think this is a cool feature, but i think the keybord isn't worth the prize (too expensive).
I haven't tested this with other keyboards."

6306,"Played this game in a year's time to get all the achievements, and it was worth it!

A game that is different with its 2D pixelated gameplay when comparing it to Minecraft. The boss battles are challenging, when setting it on Expert or Master difficulty, but rewarding after slaying them with the right weapons. The gameplay itself, is so far good when you start from scratch and evolve over the course of your journey. The accessory slots is an fantastic feature of applying awesome equipment to dodge, gain short invincibility, speed, health regeneration, flying and having info displayed to you. The four weapon classes are especially cool depending on how you like to play: warrior, ranger, summoner or sorcerer. The music of the game is entertaining and soothing when walking in certain biomes. The Npcs are a nice addition to the game as well along with creating buildings with a certain purpose.

Would recommend playing this game and it is best and fun playing it with friends."
6307,"Great fun with friends, a lot of stuff to do."
6308,"exploring is very fun
"
6309,very fun and great game with friends
6310,Buy this game or I will hunt you down and make you. Its so fucking good that I'm only writing this review after 5 hours. And by the way: ITS NOT 2D MINECRAFT.
6311,"terraria is the best game 
"
6312,oi
6313,"i genuinly hate this game so much, if i could, i would send the people who made this games souls to hell."
6314,"Terraria is a great game overall. It has loads of bosses, loads of potential projects, loads of unique weapons so you can find your own play style and it has 4 classes and 3 difficulties so you can replay it multiple times. Not to mention challenges that you see youtubers all the time, and if you enjoy suffering you can try for the worthy master mode. I've beaten the game once on PS4 in 1.3, and am yet to complete it in 1.4, which i have decided to do with my friend who gifted me the game as soon as i built my new pc. And for the last time, it is NOT 2d Minecraft. If i hear another person say this i'm going to remove their kneecaps. There are far too many differences for this to be a mere clone."
6315,"I enjoyed it, I love the graphics, the gameplay. really good game."

6318,my favorite survival game
6319,"So I've started playing this game years ago, and even till now it's one of my favourite games. In this game you can have many many hours of fun. It impressed me so much that I even bought it on multiple consoles like the WiiU or the PS4. I recommend this game to everybody that likes Open-World-Sandbox games with a nice progression feeling that you get stronger the more you play and obtain. Its A LOT of fun with friends too.  The Vanilla Game approximately takes 80-100 hours to complete the Game and most of its contents (my experience). But with mods like for example ""Calamity""  you can even increase the playtime."
6320,Fun
6321,"It's alright, I suppose..."
6322,i died once
6323,So much fun!
6324,"I got this game around 2016 but just recently got back into it. At least 50 of the hours I have are from me accidentally opening it without realizing it because it mutes the music if you don't have the window open. The other 312 or so are from me actually playing the game. At least 100 of those are from when I started playing again, and 33 are from the past two weeks.

Needless to say, this game is good. I am now re-addicted to it. God help us all."
6325,good music cool boss
6326,great game
6327,yesnt
6328,"It,s perfect !"
6329,"hey, its cool."

6352,Complex at first but a must when playing with friends.
6353,i have spent so many hours its so fun
6354,good
6355,"This game has a special place in my heart. I have a lot of fond memories of me and my little brother playing on worlds together. We'd play for so long our parents would have to wrench us from our computers. I went from my first copper sword to fighting the moonlord with my bro, and I wouldn't change any of it. 10/10"
6356,So good I bought it for all my friends. Very addictive and less boring than minecraft.

6368,ok
6369,yes
6370,I miss the old character designs that were stolen from final fantasy 5 in April 2011
6371,"Honestly, its worth it. The game is amazing, and has so much to do in it. The only thing I don't like, is the way you have to get used to the mobs/monsters. At least for me they made my skin crawl but 11 hours in and its no problem. You'll get used to it. One last thing... The Sound Track Is Amazing"
6372,i love it
6373,Honestly a great game but there's so many parts of the game that I can't stand.
6374,great game
6375,Still a W 11 years later

6401,"This game is actually amazing. Its my favorite game so far. It's really fun with the progression. Once you play this game, you are gonna keep playing it. This game is much if you have friends. This is one of the best survival games, in my opinion. If you are reading this, just stop scrolling and buy it man, you are not gonna regret it. The music is bussin.  Again, this is the best survival game out there, in my opinion. I still think there should be a soap weapon (like bleach or soap launcher) to kill eye-like enemies/bosses instantly, lol."

6429,SO MUCH FUN
6430,"This game is AMAZING. I love all the different tiny details and mechanics and how you can stay hooked even if you beat it already. There are also so many challenges to try out like classes, mods, and more. You can also probably see by my almost 500 hours of play time that this game is so worth it. People who say Terraria is just 2D Minecraft makes me so mad because Terraria has so much more than Minecraft in it. (and technically Terraria came out first so Minecraft is just 3D Terraria)."
6431,"cool game
"
6432,"I bought this game when it came out, it has changed so much since release. I love every aspect of this game. It can be as difficult as you'd like, and you are rewarded for the difficulty increase. 10/5"

6448,"I forced my best friend that hates Terraria to play the game, he loves the game now."
6449,"Seriously a great game. So many hours of adventuring and finding new loot that you never take your hands off the keyboard. Even though they said they would stop, the devs also keep updating the game, adding more and more content."

6502,The game is so unique with so many references to others things like during a blood moon you can kill a frankeinstien. All around good game and good play.

6508,Very addicting game with devs that truly love the game. Combine that with the 10$ price tag and it it is a must play
6509,"Top of the line Survival and building game. I would say better than minecraft in some places, like bosses. Terraria has so much more content, like many MANY more items, and mobs. it is also featured on the world's biggest game distrobutor, Steam. It is very fun and I would reccomend this game to anyone. not only is it easy to find anywhere, it is also supported big time by mods. 11/10 good job relogic :)"

6532,"Obviously it's a pretty good game considering the overwhelmingly positive reviews, but it does suffer heavily from the issue of the game being incredibly grindy. Get it if you want something to sink too much hours into or if you're going to play it with your friends. If not, it's an average single player experience with a lot of love put into it."

This game might be confusing if it's your first 10 hours or so, but that's what the fandom wiki is for (not the official wiki). I am in love with this game, I could just load it up and be walking around my world and would still be entertained. There's so much things to do, things to see, things to learn.

Amazing."

6686,"Wonderful game! I first touched the game back in 2020. I loved it since, although at the start of my journey, I lacked motivation to keep playing from the Ore Grinding, and since me knowing absolute nothing about the game back then, I was clueless about what a fun game this is, I started as the Summoner class, since it being the easiest for me back then. (Dodge so the summons deals the damage for u) It is for sure to say, I still love summoner class, But Ranger and Melee takes the cake for me. Even if u dont want to do bosses no more, just to have fun and chill. there are so many golf maps u can find in the workshop.
Vanilla Aside, Mods for the game, such as Calamity Mod is A M A Z I N G! new bosses, new biomes, New weapons, and even new class. All Terraria players could ever dream. Buying this game was for sure one of the best choices i made in a while."
6687,"the game is yes
"
6688,"i love it
"
6689,so fun
6690,good
6691,"The better funny block game. Its a joy to fight all the bosses with the huge diversity of weapons, progression feels really great. It makes you wanna keep replaying it over and over just to try a new weapon every run. Amazing game, its the result of over 10 years of love put into this world by the developers, props to them. An absolute must play in my opinion."
6692,very good game
6693,played like 10k hours before buying it 10/10
6694,yes
6695,"Terraria is one of the best games of all time, I have played over 300 hours and I can say that I wholeheartedly recommend."
6696,minecraft on steroids
6697,"Terraria is one of those games you will always go back to. I feel like in 20 years I'll still be playing this game. This game has been getting updates for as long as I can remember and even after they're done they have put so much love into this game it's become truly great. This is one of THE BEST multiplayer games out there. You can spend hours and hours in this game. The bosses are cool and unique, the weapon and equipment loadouts are basically infinite, and there's some great building aspects, too. The soundtrack is top tier and really adds a lot to the game. Even after beating the game a few times like I have, you can check out the million community mods to make the game a whole new experience. I'll always love the time I've spent on Terraria with friends. This game really is one of the greatest games of all time."
6698,Its a very cool game i decided to do my first playtrought moded with calamity and on expert and now im at devourer of gods after 100 hrs. I love this game and i wish others will play it too
6699,Always something to do. I just wish there were more keybinds for things like turning ruler mode on and off but that's just a quality of life thing.
6700,This is a great game. The art style is cool and the game being 2d makes it so much easier to find where you came from. The music is great.

6706,"It's really amazing. Not only is it hard as hell, it's super satisfying when you beat your first boss.
You are going to die a lot but it's not discouraging as the only thing bruised is your ego, which makes you get back up and get better. So much content and replay value is of the charts. And if you call it 2D Minecraft. I am gonna throw hands like Skeletor."

6726,nice game
6727,this game is so awesome and fun
6728,"been playing this game for a while.  Terraria is one of the most replayable boss rush I've ever played. The best part is that you don't have to be the best at the game to play it (although I've beaten calamity mod reveangeance so I'm not too bad either) with the classic mode, but if you want a more rewarding and difficult experience you can go with expert mode. Just do yourself a favor and don't play the game on master mode, you'll thank me later."
6729,BUILD KILL WALL KILL LORD WIN GAME MOD GOOD! üëç
6730,yes
6731,"Levelling up is good and quite long-term, you can keep playing for a long time (unlike games that have run out of ways to advance, after 3 months)"

6770,"very good
"
6771,"0/10 - the game is barely acceptable at best.

I for one started playing around 2013 with a pirated version of the game and even then I felt like I had spent too much - that's why since then I gifted this game to like 3-4 people, if I suffer you should too.

One of the biggest sins of this game is that it seriously lacks in replay value. After more than 650 hours between vanilla and mods I'm almost kinda bored of it.
Idk about you but in today's game marketplace I expect more out of a game that costs a whopping 10 bucks.

I'd say only buy this if you like one-time purchase games with a great community, that still get updated 11 years after release by devs that listen to player feedback - otherwise if you're a sane person, stay away."

6810,awesome game try it!
6811,minecraft but 2d and harder like bro u know how surprised I was when I realized how hard it is just to do something as simple as make a bed (I played minecraft before this and I thought it'd be as easy as getting 3 wool from sheep but instead it's as hard as getting 35 cobwebs by mining a lot and occasionally sometimes maybe possibly finding a cave with cobwebs)
6812,"Very fun to play with friends but I still have not gotten The Axe even though I have the Zenith. >:(
Still fun game tho."
6813,mid
6814,good fun game with lots to do and make.
6815,"I used to be one of those who didn't really know Terraria back then, I mislead Terraria since it reminded me of Minecraft in some aspects but how wrong I was... Terraria has his own personality far from other games and in any case is a simple copy of what was popular back then. Basically you've a game with different world-phases with  different bosses (up to 17), a vast world with biomes, lots of options to take and to be specialised combat-wise (such as ranged or summoner).  Different difficulties and new ones with the new update, alchemy, special waves of enemies (goblins in pre-hardmode) and much more just for you to discover. Don't be fooled of his apparently simple 2D because it is really hard and even more if you play mastermode + medium-core (which I do), try it and then judge for yourself.  (sorry for typos)"

6837,"All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 is a 1996 American animated musical fantasy adventure film, and a sequel to Goldcrest Films' animated film All Dogs Go to Heaven (1989).[2] Produced by MGM/UA Family Entertainment and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation, it was co-directed by Paul Sabella and Larry Leker. Dom DeLuise reprises his role from the first film, alongside new cast members Charlie Sheen, Ernest Borgnine and Bebe Neuwirth, respectively. New characters are voiced by Sheena Easton, Adam Wylie and George Hearn.

Don Bluth, the director of the original film, had no involvement with it. It was the second of only two theatrical sequels to a film directed by Don Bluth to not involve Bluth himself, the first being An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, as 13 sequels to The Land Before Time and a single sequel to The Secret of NIMH were direct-to-video releases along with two sequels of An American Tail in 1998‚Äì2000, as well as An All Dogs Christmas Carol. This was MGM's last theatrically released animated film until Igor (2008). It had a DVD double feature release with the first one on March 14, 2006 and January 18, 2011. It was also released on Blu-ray on March 29, 2011. The film also served as the series premiere for the All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series."

6840,"Although the journey is over, I still come back to play again and again. Terraria is a wonderfully made game, and really the first of its kind. The game uses aspects from an RPG aspect and adds a survival aspect, not to mention the amount of effort and hard work that went into the game in order to make it as well as it is today. Although Terraria is coming to a close soon, I think it is fair to say that it holds a little in all of our hearts for the years that have and are to come."

"
6879,"this has been the third time that I have bought this game and never regretted getting it because its incredibly fun to play. the game itself does have its flaws a few minor bugs here and there but nothing to bad from my experience.  the game also looks really good it has a more unique look that makes the game even better.  plus its can be replayed over and over plus when you add mods in after it adds so much more to the game with mods because they can add so much that makes the game so much better it makes so that you can play for thousands of hours and enjoy that time and not feel like your doing the exact same thing.

however the game isn't without its flaws the biggest of which in my opinion is the grinding because I myself don't mind some grinding but at times it can get a little bit tedious when you get bad luck for a awhile and the spend a large amount of time looking for something when someone else might find it while not even looking for it which can be frustrating especially because some of the best stuff in certain parts of the game is hours of grinding."

6894,I love this game so much
6895,i love being bisexual
6896,"So I will admit I never really ""got"" Terraria since this was on my radar about the same time Minecraft was so I would more often play that with a decent mod pack. That all changed with the rise of handheld/mobile gaming. For one Modding is a lot harder unless you have an android or a deck and two I found that I preffered to play 2d games on these platforms rather then my 3D bread and butter on the PC.

So if you like me and avoid this (and others like it) in favor of 3D open world crafters, if you are looking for a game to play on your switch, phone, or deck. Check this out. You can do far worse!"

6935,"One of the most fun games I've ever played. It has a difficulty range fit from beginner to experienced player. The game features enough difference between the classes to make multiple play-throughs worth it and enough creativity in building that they aren't needed. With the use of Easily available and very well polished mods the replay value opens up massively and the post game content becomes almost another game in and of itself. Between PC, mobile, and Tmodloader, I have well over 1300 hours for less than $35 usd."

7014,"For the short time I spent with it, I had fun. But I am NOT going back to this anytime soon.

Terraria is Minecraft but 2d and with more of a focus on gameplay rather than creativity. But the one thing that other crafting games have that Terraria doesn't is A DIRECTION! I have absolutely no idea what I'm supposed to be doing in this game, and nothing in the game explains what any of the crafting recipes are or what I'm supposed to be using any of the crafting stations for. Heck, I'm not even sure what is and isn't a crafting station. I stopped playing after killing the Giant Eye boss because that was the only direction I had.

Not to mention being a beginner player and only playing with friends (Who are seasoned veterans of Terraria) who know absolutely everything and spend all their time doing OTHER SHIT rather than teaching me anything. 

Yeah I'm good. Thanks for 21 hours, I'll stick to Minecraft and Don't Starve."

7077,"Got this game via the Humble Bundle (back when they had really good stuff), as a 4-pack (though none of the people I gave the extra copies plays it). I must say that the learning curve was a little steep for me at the beginning, especially figuring out how to navigate vertically (use platforms and ropes until you get or make the ""proper"" equipment; i.e. grappling hooks and jumping/flying accessories). If you don't mind the spoilers, visit the Official Terraria Wiki. You should at least learn about the different game phases so that you can be better prepared for the transition to ""hardmode"" (the gameplay changes dramatically after you defeat a certain boss).

I've now completed 800 hours playing the game on-and-off since I got it some years ago. I only now feel confident to attempt getting to hardmode.

I was going to compare Terraria to Minecraft (I had made a list of Minecraft cons, compared to Terraria), but I think [url=https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/minecraft-vs-terraria]this[/url] article will explain enough for you to see if Terraria is a good fit for you.

I hope you have a great time with Terraria like I had (without being so afraid to advance to hardmode)"

Probably enjoy it more if I played with friends (of which i have zero) and had the patience to figure everything out without constantly having to refer to wikis and guides (patience I don't have).

Great game if you're into that sort of thing. Guess you can't really complain for ¬£7.

Pretty much just a case of ""get this to do this but to get that you need to find this and then get that so you can craft this but to get there to find that you first need to go here and get this to make that so that you can get there and make that thing but also before you go you'll need to craft this"" until you get bored and go outside. but before you go out side you'll need to find shoes and...."

The store page says the game supports the languages French, Italian, German, Spanish (Spain), Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Simplified Chinese. But that's not true, because all those languages are used with the metric system, as a customer I feel lied to.

7174,"The only water I drink is sparkling water because sparkling water is for rich people, and I'll tell you why. You can get non-carbonated water, still water, from the hecking tap, the government gives you that heck, effectively for free. Sparkling water you have to buy so if you only drink sparkling water, you only drink rich mans water. I explained this to someone, some bumbaclot, and he replied with the typical ""But I don't like sparkling-"" You don't like sparkling water? You don't like water? ""Yeah but the bubbles!"" The bubbles? You're scared of bubbles, you little heck? It doesn't taste of anything. It has bubbles in it, oh, you're afraid of bubbles? heck is wrong with you?

7186,"i've done 3 full playthroughs of terraria and while i absolutely do recommend the game to most people i thought i'd point out some of the less good things with the game that might be a dealbreaker for some:

- the grind absolutely sucks. if you want to get a specific item you will likely have to farm it for ~30m-2h 
- this includes fishing quests. you need 6 different items at a 2.5% drop rate, and you can only do one quest every real life 20 minutes 
- the game is extremely overwhelming. at the time of writing this, there are 565 unique weapons in the game, and you WILL need to have a wiki page open while playing
- there's no crossplay between PC & mobile
- the steam workshop sucks. to find 1 good mod you will have to dig through 99 lazily made ones that either changes one sound in the game or gives a character big tits

the game is however amazing and i do recommend it to most people"
7187,I want to live in the Mushroom Cave and be one with the fungi
7188,"Great game. The 1.4 updates roped me back in, I had started playing back in 1.2. I remember Expert mode not being difficult enough, and master mode is just right. Journey mode is perfect for building or newer players getting used to the game. It has something for everyone.

7218,replayable
7219,"At 78 hours (at the time of this review) spent on Terraria, I should not have to convince you that it is a personal favorite of mine, and that's just considering the time spent on the PC version, whereas the Xbox 360, PS4, 3DS, and Switch version all carry close to the same amount of playtime, if not even more.

The graphics quality is smooth on the eyes, the caves well designed. The bosses bring quite a challenge and stopping point to an otherwise free-spirited adventure. The weapons are most intriguing. The overall crafting is easy to grasp. The NPCs feel interactive and less like plain AIs. The building is so in-depth that there is almost nothing you cannot do. There's so much to do in this game that it's hard to describe every single thing. The most important thing is that this game brings with it the best experience to be had in any Sandbox game to date."

7260,"Terraria is an amazing city builder, after travelling to an unexplored land, one or more travelers quickly establish low income housing and begin tackling real urban problems like rampaging undead and demonic eyeballs the size of a small house. Terraria is an amazing RPG where adventurers adorn themselves with the spoils of war and gear themselves in preparation for their next showdown, knowing whatever awaits them next will have them fighting for their lives. Terraria is a wonderful survival game, where the lush plains of yesterday are to be the dank and terrifying hellscape of tomorrow."

7279,"It's a classic! Terraria has so much to do and there's never a dull moment. Whether youre playing with friends or are on your own, the possibilities are endless."
7280,good
7281,"terraria is a game about a hero's journey to beat mythical lovecraftian creatures in a sandbox survival 2D style game.
it's a game that shows you about progress and how far you've want to become each time you beat each bosses.

the art style and the Soundtrack of this games is amazing
the combat system and gameplay is superb making each items has a specific purpose each time.
it's a blast of a game that shows seamless in time and prove to be quite beautiful and many memories that you and you're friends could make."
7282,For only $9.99 (often going on sale) this game is an absolute bargain.. Bosses! Weapons! Building! Exploring! Multiplayer! Pets! Nothing I could ever write could express how much content this game has... plus this game has a huge modding community so if you somehow get tired of vanilla there's even more to explore! If you don't have this game you are honestly missing out. This is the #2 game I would recommend to anyone I meet (Second only to Hollow Knight my favorite game of all time). It is a priceless game that I'd be willing to pay more than $70 for and it only costs $9.99.... This is by far the greatest deal of a game available
7283,solid game
7284,I need help!

"
7303,"Incredibly addicting and satisfying no matter how many new worlds you create. Which I guess is true of all sandbox games, but point stands. The NPCs are all very helpful and full of charm, the boss fights are insanely fun"

7316,"I've played Terraria since the early days.  They have continued to support this game and the thriving community!  The mods for the game allow for even more customization of desired content and challenge to the game concept.  I love the art style, action, survival and platforming that the game has to offer.  A very fun mix of crafting/creating and survival combat elements."
7317,Amazing adventure
7318,"its good

7321,it's really good you guys
7322,best game ever
7323,"Spent 100+ hours over 1 year in 1 world on classic - finally moved onto another world on Expert. WIsh me luck. 
Devs of the game are great and are still making updates even if they said Journey's End is gonna be the last, definitely looking forward to the Labour of Love update. 
Summoner class ftw"
7324,no thanks
7325,amazing 10/10
7326,Amazing
7327,"For how much money this game costs, there is so much content to be found. A golden rule I've always followed since I have gotten money to spend on video games, is that for every dollar spent on a game, you should get at least one hour of content, and Terraria has ABSOLUTELY delivered on that end. I can't imagine how my life would be different if I never got Terraria. This game is incredible on your own, but absolutely perfect, with friends, either mutilating bosses, building mega-bases, farming for very low drop chance items, massacring wave events, or even just exploring the map, this game has so much stuff to do and so many ways to do it. 10/10 would play 642.8 hours again."
7328,"Very fun
"
7329,"I like this game. After Journey mode I got played out, but I definitely recommend it. It used to be my go-to game for a while. I still very much enjoy playing it with friends, I just don't do that all that often. It's a very pretty game."
7330,cool and lots of things to do annoying hell bats
7331,good

7355,"insanely fun game. four different classes with four different gameplay elements of each, not only that, four different modes
Journey - a sort of creative like gamemode 
Normal - Regular gameplay
Expert - New boss ai's, enemies do more damage and have more health, higher drop chances, and exclusive accessories dropped by each boss.
Master - the same as expert but with even more scaled difficulity in health and damage and bosses have exclusive mounts and pets.
this is already a LOT of content for a cheap game like this, but remember this has full mod compatability, workshop compatability, multiplayer, servers, and much much more.
definetly worth buying even at full price"

7422,this game is perfect for when you are bored or just have nothing to do i have been playing it with my best friend which made it even better!
7423,"Saying this game is amazing is like saying the sky is blue - it's obvious. Every bit of this game is crafted to perfection by creators who both love this game and listen to their community (unseen qualities in most games). It is a game of infinite possibilities and I come back to it at every chance I get. Everyone loves this game, they just don't know it yet."

7560,"This is easily my favorite game of all time. All the systems work so wonderfully. The mining, crafting, combat, and overall progression system is just superb. And the community that supports it is one of the best I've seen in a good while, with all the content they make off of the game and the mods, resource packs, and maps. The dev team is also one of, if not, the best I've ever seen. The upcoming labor of love update should be proof of that. Overall Terraria is a really fun game and it's not really surprising why it's the 9th best selling video game worldwide."

7577,great to play with friends
7578,"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Youtube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing . I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories.."

7595,"It's a really good game in general really, only thing you should be careful of is bosses ad really just starting the right way. It becomes difficult for those who go straight to exploring with no gear at the start."

7599,epic game i recommend
7600,"This is one of those insane value/dollar games that I just can't seem to stop coming back to.  I've put in somewhere between 500 and 1000 hours (unsure because I regularly walk away with it on).  It's a simple 2d proceduraly generated live action rpg with lots to offer, a great single player and multiplayer experience.  Great for teaching kids WASD and mouse."

7635,Minecraft but better if you like more kind of RPG games
7636,"This game is half ""Why the fuck do I keep dying"" and half completely destroying things. Great game.

Okay now for my actual opinions.

After 74 hours on pc and over 300 on xbox.. It's safe to say this game is BEYOND addictive, So many things to explore, items to collect, things to brutally test your new weapon on. Idk this game is just amazing, and most certainly fun. I 100% recommend this, there's truely something for everyone in this game, especially once you get into the game's mods and resource packs on the Workshop"
7637,its good... like REALLY good

This armor pros makes no sense when you are getting hit by 400+ damage attack. Armor should be buffed for master mode

7649,fun
7650,"Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Girl, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream girl
You make flowers bloom
Girl, you make the stars collide
And I don't know what I did
To get lucky like this but it sure feels fine

'Cause you give me love and affection
I give you all my protection
I'm tryna stay by your side till the day I die
And you give me all of your love
And I give you all of my trust
I know you'll never betray me and leave my side, oh my

Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Girl, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream girl
You make flowers bloom
(Girl, you make the flowers bloom)
Girl, you make the stars collide
(Don't you know you make the stars collide?)
And I don't know what I did
To get lucky like this but it sure feels fine

'Cause I see your face when I'm sleepin'
I wake up grateful to breathe in
The air you float through, I wrote you a lullaby
A song to sing on your pillow
Swift as a swing on a willow
My sweetest words I'm the birds in your perfect sky, oh my

Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Girl, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream girl (Girl)
You make flowers bloom
(Girl, you make the flowers bloom)
Girl, you make the stars collide
(Don't you know you make the stars collide?)
And I don't know what I did

7658,"This is a game I will never finish due to the sheer size and girth of this games content. I've played a ton of the mobile version back in 2015 and a bit of the Xbox One Version going into this game. It has taken me 14 hours of building up and restarting to join friends world and as of July 2022, I have only just beaten the wall of flesh with two friends. I cannot wait to build another character for myself and try to get as far into this game by myself."

In which there are quests, bosses, a bunch of different mobs, build, dig where you want, there is a lot of variety in the game, you can play with friends without any problems.

7707,contains squares
7708,pretty cool i like game
7709,"Many players might say that Terraria is the 2D version of Minecraft, but I disagree wholeheartedly.
Personally, the reason why I could play Minecraft for hours is because of the mods that I could install. But with Terraria, the base game alone could keep me occupied for hours :)

Just make sure you got some friends to play with you (Playing alone is cool too, perhaps becoming the architect that you have always wanted to become?)"
7710,Game good cause i have friend who plays it
7711,This game can suck my balls and so can u
7712,very good
7713,"Terraria, where do i start... If you want a game when you never know when your good enough and lose to a boss multiple times over and over again, or if you just wanna fish and ""An Evil Presence Is Watching You"" pops up, this game is for you. Hours of tediously looking for certain ore, days of prepping for bosses, and finally trying to look good while you do it. But all jokes aside Terraria is a absolutely phenomenal game and i highly recommend you play it if you haven't already! :)"
7714,Its a very fun game and easy to learn
7715,The better Minecraft.
7716,Bought this game years ago and didn't think I'd be playing it years later. Devs Keep bringing in new content and it just keeps getting better.

7730,thought it was just a 2d minecraft but NO its not its a pretty fun game and has way more things to explore and has a big variety of biomes mobs and just things!
7731,perfection
7732,I find it insane that this game is less than 60 dollars. So much stuff to do. I love how there is 4 classes and if i beat the game i can have a new play through and it will feel fresh. plus modding and (you get the modding platform t mod loader) has hours and hours worth of mods to play.

7803,i played this on phone and beat it a couple times already so it kinda boring but i would recommend it ig
7804,Fantastic game to play by yourself or w friends. 2d Adventure game with 100+ achievments and new things to do every 5 minutes; One of the best games your gonna find to play freely and build like minecraft

7807,"Based game. You may get burned out after finishing a playthrough but, there's always a time where you come back to play it once again. Extra fun if you play with friends, you make new memories with them even if it means dying to a boss 20 times, I'm looking at you, Duke Fishron.

10/10, would die to Duke Fishron again."

10/10 would buy a 4th time"
7812,Best game I've ever played.
7813,"Can easily spend hundreds of hours on the game, especially in a single play through if you want to get most items. More than 30 bosses and thousands of items. Very replayable on multiple difficulties including a journey mode difficulty for new players. Only downside I will say is the game doesn't really tell you how the boss order should work or even explain how to summon bosses/use certain crafting stations like demon alters. It does have a guide that tells you what items craft into what which is very helpful, but highly recommend looking through the wiki to figure out information if you have never played the game."
7814,this game is actually sex
7815,"Weakling friends wont play Calamity mod hardcore, revengence, death, malice copper shortsword only, no healing potions, no wings, no crystal hearts with me...other than that its fun"
7816,It's peak.
7817,lol rick rolled
7818,I love the game on xbox. So I thought it would be fun to playthrough it on pc. So I bought the game and it was really fun until I kept having this reocouring bug where when I built a house it would say a wall was missing. I built several houses and I got the same response every time. Please patch this.

7837,I have over 400 hours on this game including all of the platforms I've played it on and I plan to spend many more. This game can be extremely difficult and infuriating but at the same time extremely rewarding. The feelings of fighting Moon Lord for the first time is a feeling I will never be able to recreate from any video game. If you don't currently own this game you should. If I had to pay 10 dollars for every play though I would. This game is the closest to perfection that we will see in a video game for a long time.

I have around 250 hrs at the time of writing this but you can count on that number getting larger. In short it's the best 10 bucks you'll ever spend (probably).

But sometimes, SOMETIMES this game makes me a rage a little by getting killed by an endless boulder rain."
7872,"The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hitpoints, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks. The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring. His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider. Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings. Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.He can be used to jump over any level Walls, rendering them ineffective against Hog Riders. Note that while this allows Hog Riders free access to what lies behind the Walls, it does not open up gaps for other troops to move through. If the Hog Riders need the support of other ground troops, you will still need to deploy Wall Breakers, a Jump Spell, or Earthquake Spells in order to assist them. Hog Riders can be used en masse, i.e. a ""Hog Rider Rush"", without requiring any Wall Breakers to break Walls. However, such a strategy can be costly in terms of Dark Elixir, and sports weaknesses against defending Clan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps, a problem which only becomes more prominent at higher levels. At Town Hall 10 and above, Hog Riders can be combined with Miners in a strategy known as Miner Hog Hybrid. Both troops are able to bypass Walls innately, but Miners do not have a preferential target, allowing them to cover for Hog Riders by dealing with defending Heroes and Skeleton Traps. The combination also has weaknesses against flying Clan Castle troops, as neither are able to target air. At lower levels, Hog Riders are quite capable of acting as distracting troops like Giants; they have nearly as much health as a similar-level Giant, move twice as fast, and do considerably more damage. They work well with the Healing Spell when you group several of them together. A good tactic for using Healing Spells is to place them strategically on a cluster of defenses (at least about 3 or more) and also deploy them shortly before the Hog Riders arrive in the area, i.e. deploy them ahead of the Hog Riders. This is so that the Hog Riders get the most out of the Healing Spell, and destroy the defenses without losing too much HP. Spots where Giant Bombs or Bomb Towers are/may be should be given special attention when deploying Healing Spells. Hogs of the same level as the Giant Bomb will survive a single Giant Bomb, but they're helpless against a pair of Giant Bombs even with a Healing Spell. Heal them after they've gone through a Giant Bomb blast. The Hog Rider is one of the best troop types for drawing out Clan Castle troops, as it can avoid Walls to penetrate deep enough to reach centrally-placed Clan Castles (and enough health to not die before it gets there). Deploy one or a few to trigger the Clan Castle troops, then lure the reinforcement troops to the corner side, and deploy multiple Archers or Wizards to slaughter them, and then deploy the remainder of your Hog Riders. This strategy is especially effective during Clan War raids. However, Skeletons from the Skeleton Trap and Heroes can also easily kill the Hog Riders, as they can only target defenses, so make sure to have some troops that target anything, such as Wizards, which can swipe out the Skeletons. Hog Riders don't target air so flying Clan Castle troops, especially Dragons, can be a big threat. Most mass Hog Rider strategies in Clan Wars require that the Clan Castle troops be killed first by luring. Bring other troops in addition to Hog Riders, such as Wizards, to deal with enemy Clan Castle troops and clean up the base. Poison Spells can be used to kill almost any enemy Clan Castle troop, but beware as the troops will attempt to flee the poison. If the Poison Spells are decently leveled, and you effectively keep the Clan Castle troops from escaping the Poison Spell with distracting troops, they can eliminate almost any troop. They can also be used to dispense of those pesky Skeletons risen from the Skeleton Traps. Time is also a factor to consider. With only 3 minutes in an attack, it is essential to make sure that this whole process and the remainder of the attack is done as quickly as possible to avoid running out of time.Defending against Hog Riders is tricky, as their ability to bypass Walls renders them irrelevant. However, the fact that they can jump over Walls and attack defenses means that they may leave behind their ground support (such as Barbarians, etc.), as they will not be able to follow. This will allow your interior defenses to concentrate on the Hog Riders. Another way to defend against Hog Riders is to exploit the fact that they will attack the closest defensive building. You can arrange your base in such a way so that you have high-powered defenses on the inside and lower-powered defense on the outside, with a layer of resources in between. That way, the Hogs will (in theory) complete a loop around your base before being able to attack your interior defenses (Inferno Towers, X-Bows, etc.), by which time they should have all been killed by the interior defenses. You can place Spring Traps in between defensive buildings to take out a few Hog Riders at a time; good usage of multiple Spring Traps can severely hinder a Hog Rider rush. Hog Riders can be easily killed using ""forced pathing"". Forced pathing is a strategy that manipulates the Hog Rider AI and makes them go to at least 2 defenses that cannot be prevented by surgical dropping or side clearing. Placing a set of Giant Bombs in between the two can most certainly hinder the attacker progress. They would not be able to heal the Hog Riders in time. Clan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps set to Ground Mode can be an annoyance to mass Hog Rider raids, as Hog Riders will not attack them unless all defenses have been destroyed. Make sure to centralize them if you want to beat Hog Riders. In Clan Wars, Dragons are excellent troops to place in Clan Castles against Hog Riders, especially for Town Halls 8 and 9. They have high HP, meaning they won't die easily and can kill mass quantities of Hog Riders swiftly if not properly lured. Most mass Hog Rider strategies require that the enemy Clan Castle troops be killed first, so if the attacker lures out a Dragon, but fails to kill it, then a 3-star win is next to impossible, much less a 1-star win via destroying 50% of the buildings. Multi-target Inferno Towers can be a severe hindrance to Hog Riders, having high HP to take several hits from Hog Riders, while hitting large groups of them. Although the Hog Rider is certainly not a liability on defense, the fact that all defensive troops are unimpeded by Walls negates the primary advantage of the Hog Rider. Still, for the space they take they are faster and more damaging compared to Giants.The Hog Rider undergoes significant visual changes at levels 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Initially, the Hog Rider is a dark-skinned man with a black mohawk and beard. He also has a gold earring in his right ear and sports two heavy golden wristbands, a red belt, and a brown loincloth. The Hog Rider's hammer has two brass bands."

7908,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

8070,"[h1] OPENING THOUGHTS [/h1]
Sensational game defining a generation, approaching 400 hours on steam however if you include old Xbox 360 and Xbox one hours its definitely reaching the 1.5 to 2 thousand hours scale. One of the few games that showed up and stuck around with no main-stream re-releases or sequels to ""keep the hype"", no pay to win, micro-transactions, loot boxes or additional payment of any kind after initial purchase. Just a one time payment of half your average triple A title and nothing else for the next 10 years. Incredible.

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]
A simple yet compelling gameplay loop to keep you engaged; cycling through its three main aspects: Building, Exploring, and Combat, each evolving and adding new elements each time you revisit them. While the gameplay looks simple of the surface it houses a large variety of different pathways and challenges allowing you to focus into combat classes and damaged types, combating bosses at a chosen time and coming back to others later, optional events and bosses not key or in anyway required for progression in the game while giving the player an edge in the future if they choose to.

[h1]COMMUNITY/DEVELOPERS[/h1]
With a game that's been around as long as Terraria it builds a large dedicated community around it and the developers do a great job with keeping in touch with said community even to this day still providing us with teasers and answering questions about upcoming updates. The game also has a large and still thriving youtube and reddit community providing fans with endless streams of content as well as tips and trick with new ideas for their own games. I've listed a few of my favourites below.

[h1]MY EXPERIENCE[/h1]
I probably started playing on xbox 360 for the first time around late 2013/2014. I was around 9 years old and one of my friends showed it to me, i remember instantly falling in love with it, running home from school everyday to squeeze in as much time as i could in every waking moment. Spanning what is probably about 100 worlds and characters with my and my mates most recent being played around the beginning of this year. I remember he so scared of my first time conquering the dungeon or entering hell and finally reaching hard mode for the first time; discovering and entirely different game with new monsters, biomes, bosses, weapons and what not was incredible. 

I've been alive longer knowing and playing this game than I not and I still play to this day on and off - If that isn't a positive review then I don't know what is."

The spell, the spell? It's known too well
So very well, I need not spell
For if I spell the spell too well
A spell will send me off to hell
And hell I want no part to dwell
So rather this, in short, I tell
It's only for the spell I dwell
And may I spell so very well
The very spell will suit you well"

8166,"Dear god where do i even start with this game.

Terraria is a coalition of what every game wishes to acquire. This game includes a nearly infinite character creator, casual and energetic game play, music beyond the stars, a huge fan base, boss fights, and a history of evolution. All of these great artifacts are very difficult to get right, but Terraria did it right. This game even incorporated all those details, into just a 2D side-scroller.

Lets start with the character creator. there isn't much to say about this one, you start off with the default character. You are given 4 choices of clothing for both sexes. (If i say gender, someone might get mad.) There is a catalog of hair to choose from, there are short hairs and medium hairs. The greatest point of this creator is the fact that each and every part can be colored to your desire. You can change the color of all the following: Hair, Eyes, Skin, Shoes, Shirts, and Pants. Despite such the limited choices, later on you will unlock accessories to make your experience better.

Next up, the game play. There is so much game play. it all ranges from building a house to fighting a literal moon ""lord"". At the start of your world, you spawn in with a guide who is more helpful than you think. Just like every other survival game, you start off by cutting trees and making a starter base. Once you all safe and sound, you can go out and explore, finding many creatures and ores along the way. After reaping the rewards of hard work, progress does it all by itself at that point. After some time you fight your first boss, then you build more houses. Now some NPCs can move in and give you more items. Now you face hell. Shortly after entering, you murder a wall of actual flesh (and your guide). Come out of hell to see magical ponies. Don't acknowledge the ponies and run to the Jungle and kill a statue. Once all is done, run over to the local dungeon and murder cultists. Without realizing it, you just summoned eldritch horrors into your world and you need to destroy 4 pillars to return back to normal. Once you think you've done everything, in comes the Moon Lord to kill you. After failing, he turns into bone and you get 1 of the items withing his loot pool. Hopefully if you paid attention, you can create the crucib- I mean the ""Zenith"". You did all of that? Well all that's left for you is to build to the limits of imagination. The true endgame of Terraria is to advance your skills in building.

The music of Terraria is on a completely separate level from anything else in this game. To me personally, the music is terrifying. But not in the sense you think. The music and it's 8-bit sounds put chills in my spine, why? In my mind, I can feel the boundless potential pouring from the song. Listening to the songs in this game makes me actually feel imagination itself. From space to hell, each score of music has its own story behind it, whether it be outside the game or lore-wise. Terraria music is something to be truly held out with pride.

I, myself, am not as deep in the fan base of Terraria as many others. Trust me I do enjoy this game, it's just not one i'm willing to do big things for. This isn't about me, it's about others. These fans exist on separate plains of existence. The artwork done for this game is on par with biblical paintings. The fan animations inspire others to create something. Overall, these people who love Terraria enjoy placing dedication into the things they make.

From start to finish, these boss fights give me a sense of actual stress. Some of that may be from not playing dark souls or just the music being intense. Each and every boss fight was handled with care and acted like children to the developers. Slime King is simple yet confusing, the Eye of Cthulhu is easily the most iconic, the Wall of Flesh is well-known for being unavoidable (and ""boss music 2""), Plantera is probably the first plant based boss, and the Empress of Light is a female. Finally, the final boss Moon Lord, being the long lost brother of Cthulhu.

Terraria has it's own fair share of history. There are some dedicated players who have charted all the steps taken by the developers and have put it out for the world to see. most well known person like that is ""ChippyGaming"". Unfortunately, i'm not well versed in the bible of Terraria so I don't have much to add to this part.

To sum up this whole game, the Zooligist NPC."

8182,"Terraria is an amazing game that regardless of being belittled by being called a copy of Minecraft(Which if you believe that, check the release dates of both of those amazing games) is a great game for playing by yourself or with friends. Terraria is packed with an incredible amount of content and different builds for character abilities allowing you to play how you want to. Plenty of vanity and cosmetic gear/building blocks are available as well. Not to mention the available mods for Terraria which can be absolutely insane, like Thorium, Calamity, and plenty of others. Make sure to give this game a try as freshly as possible and have fun."

8202,best thing in the world
8203,"very good game
"
8204,"This game is unbelievable, it's waaaaay better on pc than console as well. Super fun one-player, and even better multiplayer. The fact that it is so easy to run means there is no lag when playing online, so you can very casually play with a large group of friends. Don't necessarily go in thinking 2d minecraft, where the exploration is similar, loot is much more interesting and varied (not overwhelming though). This game is as polished and balanced as they come, and I hope for its longevity."
8205,"Terraria is a fairly simple concept mixed with alot of branches and customizations for gear and equipment. The game starts off with you in a forest, aided by the Guide, someone who will remain useful for the majority of the game whenever you get new ores or materials and want to know what to do with them. The best thing I can recommend is to hack down a few trees to make houses for future NPCs and to mine some ore in the Forest biome (where you start), in hopes of getting equipment for other biomes. In a sense, it has similarities to Minecraft in the early moments, but it quickly spirals into its own thing. Usually, people are meant to focus on a single ""class"" with their equipment, but I like to go hybrid and equip whatever I have that I like and take on bosses that way. Really fun with friends.

Oh, and pro-tip: if you see someone you can talk to, talk to them instead of just ignoring them, as they may either warn you not to enter the Dungeon or may be someone in need of your help to join your other allied NPCs in your village. There's virtually no reason to ignore them, unless you want to die from an obvious trap and complain online after."
8206,this truly is one of the games of all time

"
8299,"Eh, not my cup of tea.

It's basically 2D Minecraft but mobs spawn everywhere every few seconds. I like to be able to at least sort my inventory and stop for a few seconds to gather my bearings before being attacked from every direction, but if that's your thing then go for it. It's definitely more fun with friends."

8309,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

In conclusion, Terraria is one of the best games I have ever played with tons of replayablity, tough bosses and endless creativity to be had.

8384,"One of the best games i've ever played, started on mobile a long time ago and got addicted! I eventually forgot about Terraria and so when I got my first laptop i found it here, on Steam. It's an amazing experience with many options of play - style in terms of: what you play as, how you play, what route you play! It's a very open-world experience and if you're hesitating to buy this game then give it a shot, its borderline amazing and packed with content and bosses."

8402,"Fun
"
8403,I've played this game on and off for years. It was a really good game 10 years ago. It's perfect now.
8404," Very Cheap for the hours of entertainment it offers. Only 10$ for a game that competes with the likes of Minecraft, with a just as expansive modding community. Low computer requirements too, extremely easy to run, and just as easy to play with friends luckily, with smooth and well implemented Steam support.

 The game has things for basically every way you could want to play too. Any problem you have you can apply your creativity to it to solve it. From creating your own biomes if you don't have enough of one, using traps and potions to AFK events filled with enemies (Or even bosses), and far more. 

 9.5/10 game. Sadly, farming in this game can feel a bit much at times, with less than 0.1% drops. Luckly, farming the more hassling items isn't necessary along the rather smooth difficulty line. (That excludes the start of Hardmode, of course)"

8423,"Awesome experience, great for any gamer who enjoys combat, grinding and/or building. If you ever want to put in your own opinion, the creator of the game (Redigit and co.) listen and read most posts on Twitter and Reddit. It's a game you really can't go wrong with. And no, it's not 2D Minecraft."

8444,"Frankly, this is one of the greatest games I have ever played. I was team Minecraft growing up, and I didn't play it until COVID. Me and some buddies started from the ground up with no knowledge and just had a absolute blast. We keep coming back just as much or more than Minecraft. So much playability even without mods. Great game 10/10."

Highly Recommend this game to anyone thats a fan of Minecraft and a Side-Scrolling kinda genre/element!!"
8468,"I'm aware that many people greatly enjoy this game. i am not one of them. I wouldn't call it by any means a bad game, just not for me. The enemies constantly respawn, exploration is difficult and tedious, and it's hard as hell to see anything with how tiny the characters are, and progression isn't intuitive in the slightest. Also the music gets really really annoying after a while."

I'm still far from the best at playing the game, but I love to mess around on terraria with my friends. It was even how we got through quarantine in 2020 (remember that?). If you have a lower grade computer, be warned that it may be laggy because the graphics in this game are a bit wild, for lack of a better term. Regardless, I can't recommend this game enough."
8515,"Very good game, worth the money I spent on it 100%.

8540,"This is minecraft but action packed and 2D and it's freaking amazing.
I remember the first time I played this game, I believe it was back in 1958, it was the coolest game I had seen. and the art is amazing as well. I don't know how but somewhere in my playthrough on my xbox 360 I got bonded with the music and the world and the characters.
even though it doesn't have any sort of story or whatsoever. 

I give it the wall of brick award of the year. 
4/5"

8559,Endless supply of adventure lies ahead of you. From the beasts residing in the clouds to the monstrosities below the surface and beyond. In some resemblance to a pixelated horror game along with a casual adventure game or even a fishing simulator. Choose your path. Change when needed. Adapt. Survive. Conquer. Purify. Corrupt. Adventure awaits. Gods and Goddesses await you.

8565,"The best game i know, with tons of replayability, items, bosses, areas, an open world and player-created content such as servers and mods. This game is genuinely addicting, and even better when you're playing with friends. Worth every penny, you won't regret buying this. There's something for everyone here: Combat, building, exploration, bosses, incredible progression, crafting, traps, fishing, golf, events and invasions - you name it, and this game probably has it. And if it somehow doesn't, then one of the tens of thousands of mods it has definitely does.  Bask in the chaos!"

There is always more fun to be had in Terraria."

8594,its just good innit
8595,"Terraria is just an amazing game, there is no other words to describe it. I started playing last year and I saw my brother always playing it so I bought it and booted up the game. I hosted a world with my brother and I didn't have my hopes too high i was just thinking that can this 2D game possibly have that makes people sink hours and hours into it. After my first few hours playing the game I saw my self addicted and not being able to stop playing, it's like the game but some spell on me that makes me always want to play the game. I never finished the world as me and my brother got busy but later that year I picked up the game again with a friend and progressed a lot. It was super fun and I would recommend it to others the 100%, the music, the gameplay is just amazing

It is easily a 10/10 game"
8596,b
8597,"Terraria is alot of fun, however you should play with mods trust me i have 600 hours on modded, because of the calamity mod. If you are unfimiliar with the normal game you should first play that one. Oh and use the wiki because there's alot more stuff than you would think at each stage of the game.

If you don't own this game you are missing out although for some the low graphics are annoying for me it gives a unique feel to the game that it won't have if it wasn't pixelated."
8598,pretty fun
8599,"Epic game be prepared to grind for certan items tho especially in hardmode
"
8600,gud
8601,"Terraria is probably one of the best sandbox games I've ever played. Expert is uniquely challenging and the rewards feel worth it (As much as I hate some of the additions they made to the bosses). I've had tons of fun playing this with my friends, would 100% recomend."
8602,Fun but it can be a little boring especially on your own

8610,"THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY CRACKED. If my disgusting amount of playtime doesn't tell you that I think this game is pretty good, hopefully this review will. Terraria is a masterfully crafted game, with tons of different paths of gameplay, like building, fishing, and even golf, but mainly fighting. This game has many unique bosses to offer, which can be pretty tricky, particularly on harder difficulties. But hey, it's pretty fun! I could say more but I might just play some terraria instead. :D"
8611,I killed a slime

8620,"one of the most fun games i've ever played, great bosses, a LOT of weapons and items which all of em are well made, a ton of enemies and entitys in general there's over 500 entity's in this game, gameplay is smooth and sleek and fun, as I sayed there s a lot of items and weapons so you don't get bored from it even I after playing for 3 years still find new an fresh stuff its awesome, the art style is gorgeous to look at, fanbase is great only problems I can think of is the firearms don't feel and sound punchy and in multiplayer when your game crashes and join again your loots will be reseted to previous save and your whole map will be reseted. and the games lot more fun with friends and I hope game droped more loot from a boss, I played it with 2 other people and after defeating a boss only got loot for 1 person. well thats it, I cant recommend this game enough"
8621,BEST GAME EVER CANT EVEN LIE BETTER THAN MINECRAFT

Always played with my brother on the Xbox when we were younger, so this game brings some good memories"

8631,"Received Terraria as a gift on July 9th, 2011. It's been an incredible journey, and the game has evolved so much over the years. I still have copies of my well-loved (though not well-preserved...) world files from 1.0.5 and I've lost so much time just exploring, progressing, building, destroying, and collecting weapons, paintings, critters, and SO much dirt. It's a wonderful game with a lot to do, especially when you play with friends. I'm looking forward to the Labor of Love update!"
8632,good

8642,gud
8643,I have not played this game enough to be qualified to write a review.
8644,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is"

8670,Minecraft but good
8671,f
8672,it aint for me
8673,"Perfection in video game form, my 3rd favourite game of all time. 
Where do we even begin? The bosses, the events, the building... The difficulty, it's all absolutely perfect. If you ever have money spare, or know you like Minecraft, Stardew valley, or Core Keeper, buy this game and at least give it a try. You can install resource packs ranging from funny (turning the angler into a goldfish!) to.... Questionably horny...? but hey, your move man. Play how you like. BUY THIS GAME. ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES EVER MADE."
8674,I find it very fun to get better at and practice five star game
8675,this game is  so addicting once you pick it up you cant put it down
8676,"
WellÔºåit's wonderful! Fantastic!"
8677,Coooool
8678,A lot of fun with friends
8679,Very fun game but to play multiplayer you need to have 60 fps not to have struggles.
8680,Finally finished 2nd angler quest.
8681,"This game just wow you will find yourself playing this for hours and hours AND HOURS straight with a bunch of friends if your a fan of rpgs, grinding games, survival and more this game is DEFENITLY worth the price tbh its probaly worth 20 bucks so just get this game now!!!!!!!
Some people say this game is just a rip off minecraft but man theyre wrong because you can craft, fight bosses!, have a house, have npcs living in your house, and more!!!!! For a mostly pixel game the graphics are just WOW all ill say is its good, The gameplay is GREAT, The price is deffenitly worth it so buy it now before they change the price and yeah thats all i will say because this should be enough information for you to buy have a great day!"
8682,grind
8683,yes
8684,A fun and easy going game to relax into.
8685,"Terraria is a great game to sink hours into! There is a lot for you to do, like crafting, mining, exploring, fighting, and more. It is worth the money, if you ask me."
8686,it was fun
8687,minecraft 2
8688,"Terraria is downright one of the best games out there, ive played for a little over a month now and it does not get old!, It's nice to have the freedom to customize your character to fit your needs ! But, learning can be slow and at first bosses can be tough, but in the end it feels very rewarding 10/10"

8698,lost all my progress a few times but good game
8699,A
8700,.
8701,one of the best games i play
8702,"Love terraria, but if you mess with ANY of the game files your whole game save file is just gone. I learned that the hard way...."
8703,very nice
8704,very fun and adventure type game never seen anything as fun as this its way better than mine-craft could ever hope to be keep up the amazing work the graphics the NPC the magic the fun its just endless possibility!
8705,i got no friends
8706,very good
8707,collect goldfish
8708,"Have done many playthroughs before and after 1 hour, I lose the urge to conitnue. The game lacks immersion because its 2d and third person. You don't feel like your in the game, you feel like your controlling somebody thats in the game instead of actually being there. Literally 99% of the items in this game are useless, and the power creep is insane. Stats and gear scale exponentially with each boss making it quite unbalanced. Graphics are MS paint level. Lots of duplication bugs and the music sounds like arcade music that has been flushed down the toilet. The game is stupidly dark and you legit can't see anything no matter how many torches you put, it becomes an inconvenience rather than a good feature at that point. Progressing in this game has more rng than the lottery as you need the right stuff from chests which is a extremely annoying. TLDR, game is overrated."

8710,yws
8711,"Very fun. There are a lot of fun and challenging things to do.
"
8712,"fun

8713,Fun to play with friends and easy to learn.

8715,v bad
8716,one of the best games i've ever played. 10/10 buff summoners
8717,i make bald people fight eachother in the depths of h e double hockey stick
8718,great game
8719,"I really like just how creative you can get in the game. The NPCs have really nice designs most of the time, and the bosses are a lot of fun to fight regardless of whether or not it's a boss you have to fight to progress through the game."
8720,very very good
8721,nice
8722,YEET
8723,Skeletron kinda hot ngl
8724,calamity go brr
8725,"first bought terraria 
then died to solar worms 1000 times 
then beat the moonlord
then went back home and started beating luppana"
8726,browned my pants when killing a butterfly in the hallow
8727,so much to do
8728,IT BE FUN
8729,One of the best games I have ever played
8730,yes
8731,this game is go goog wooooooooooooo
8732,funny 2d block game go brrr
8733,"I'd be hard pressed to believe you haven't heard of this game. Question is, should you play it in its current state? Well, yes and no... 

The game is fun, there is a LOT you can do in this game. If you like Minecraft, I highly recommend this game to you. You will enjoy it just as much as Minecraft, maybe even more. It's just different... There's a reason Terraria recommends Minecraft and vice versa.

The only thing about this game that might not be enjoyable to some is its difficulty and how ""lost"" you can feel. There's only so much you can do pre-hard mode... What is hard mode? Well, you beat this boss in literal hell and then the game ""advances"" too hard mode where enemies are harder, new things spawn and whole sections of your world change. It can be pretty overwhelming and takes a lot of time to get used to, but if you feel like dumping a lot of hours into this game so you can feel like an overpowered god this is right for you. 

I highly suggest at least giving the game a try. The developers really care about this game and continue to update it with new and fun things to do. The games price is also a lot better than games you'll see these days. And I even got the game on sale and let me tell you I'd pay full price for it. In fact, I have on Xbox One. The game is cheap, fun and has so much you can do in it I highly doubt you'll do everything there is to do in the game."
8734,can i have my family back yet.

8794,"just get good DUDDDEEE. first step is to get zenith or however you spell it. then get a sniper ""the best weapon in the game"" put a fat scope on it then beat every boos starting from the best to worst ones. next is amour, the bestest amour to get is the green one, right before the seggsy plant lady, it gives you some good perk just for wearing it. next and final step is to asseriores to help out in battle, the best ones are the sniper scope oviously, and the green boots that let you walk on water and lava. This is the best guide anyone can give to a new/experinced player. Thank you for your time."

8916,"I have had this game for 3-4 years and have never gotten tired of it. There's so much to do and accomplish in the game and I easily put in over 200 hours into the game. For $10, this is absolutely amazing. If you're looking for a game that you can easily stick with for a long time, then this would be the one."
8917,good game
8918,"I find this game very addictive there are hundreds of things to do, their are a total of 554 weapons and bunch more items plus 100s of animals and beasts in the game if you like open world games, this gmae is for you!!
I strongly recomend this game you will not be dissapointed in the game plus its only around 10 dollars to even buy so why not spend a small amount fo money to test it out."

8933,THIS GAME HAS A SUS
8934,2d minecraft is truly fun
8935,Better than minecraft
8936,AUGH
8937,I've absolutely loved this game for years. Have played through it dozens of times and still complete a run with plenty of new and exciting things to see and do!
8938,"It's like a mixture of Stardew Valley and Minecraft, and I LOVE both so it's a 11/10 great game for me."
8939,good
8940,"Honestly, W game all around! Especially when you are playing with friends, it makes the experience 10x better."
8941,Best game I have ever played
8942,REALLY good game i have about 100 hours on console and got it on PC for mods and to play with my friends great game with a good price! I would suggest it!
8943,"Very good game over all, however if you want to get all achievements it STINKS. One achievement, ONE ACHIEVEMENT, makes all achievements a nightmare.
  You see, there is an achievement where you have to get 200 fishing quest for this idiot child. Lets say that you start doing this in hardmode: the day night cycle will be 24 minutes. In this time, you can fish and get only  1 fish to turn in. Now, you take 24 times 200 and get 4800 minutes: 80 hours. 80 HOURS of real life time.
  That's how long it would take without using bed to speed time up inbetween or figuring out how to mess with it and turn multiple in. 
  Using the bed, it would speed time up by 5 times. Now you devide 80 by 5 and get 16. 16 HOURS STILL. Mind you, that would be getting the fish and turning it in in less than a second - not possible.
  This is by far the worse decision anyone could do with achievements. Make an rng, heavily time based achievement. 1, 10, 25, 50, 200 : the fishing numbers required per achievement.
  To fix this, simpily reduce the time required to get it by half (make it require 100 instead of 200.)
  This is why it has a 2.5 % completeion rate."

8977,"Really amazing game that has you instantly sucked in. Has a nice balance between letting you explore the world, and just kind of guiding you the right direction without necessarily telling you too much directly.

I Recommend your first play through look up as little as you can, just explore and have fun, don't even try the expert mode till you beat it trust me.

After you finish the wiki is great fun to look through, there's a ton of content for subsequent playthrough's and the extra difficulties have new items which is fun.

all in all 9/10, didn't play any other games till after 150 hours, and i'm not done."

8997,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

8998,"I think they should add a Cthulhu Boss for the final prehardmode boss instead of the Wall of Flesh in Crimson worlds. Since theres an Eye and Brain of Cthulhu, it would be cool to have the Crimson final prehardmode boss be Cthulhu."
8999,Solid 7/7
9000,I Don't like it but i understand those that do
9001,"Let my hours in game let you know that this game is fun.

First off, for anyone who is unaware of this game, it is a more combat based 2D minecraft. I'll go into detail on what I mean below.

Second, great features include characters and world being saved separate and are freely interchangeable, drop in-drop out multiplayer through steam, mod-ability, and adjustable difficulty levels for those who love a challenge. 

Third, what I said before, lots of people either love or hate comparison to minecraft, know this, there are boss monsters, equipment with set bonuses, rare equipment drops, special monster events, and multiple ways to build or equip yourself for victory, there is even a guide npc right with you at the start to help you get through it all. But what I love is how easy it is to build cool houses and arenas. 

Fourth, there is a deep amount of fishing.

Fifth, cons: no game is perfect for everyone. 
The game is designed more around fighting than infinite creativity, so if you aren't the type who enjoys beating up monsters, it may not be perfect, but there is a creative mode too. 
The map is limited, you can make it pretty big, but once you get advanced items it is easy to travel it all, but some people prefer that. 
The last thing I'll consider a con is the replay-ability, there are two types of worlds, tons of variety in map randomization and even secrets to discover, but ultimately the game will follow the same overall structure each time, I think there is more than enough content to enjoy multiple times through, but the only way to get a truly different experience is to turn up the difficulty for the new enemies and items that become available. 

All that being said, I truly believe no adventurer or fighter's library would be complete without this game. I easily drop 100-200 hours per world, and love the customization of building in 2D. Seriously, any questions, comment here."

9071,I didn't want to play that game for a long time because it did not look very neat and I did not like the 2D world. But then I decided to check it out and I am so glad I did. It is so much deeper than it appears! The shift of the world to hardmode is a great idea and although a little biot challenging at first so much fun! Also there is so much cool stuff to craft! Definetly one of my favourite games!

9105,"This game is top tier, some negative steam reviews say that its ""too hard"" or that its ""too grindy"" or that it ""requires too much googling"" all not being true
-the game has diffrent diffuculties normal mode being super easy and for everyone 
-although grinding is in the game the items you need to grind are optional + i personally find it really fun
-in total my first time playing the game i had to use google 3 times and the npcs give you hints on what you are supposed to do if you talk to them, finding things would be easy if you just explore but some people instantly resort to googling
Anyway i do have some complains though but nothing really big like:
-the evil biome spread is really annoying at the start of hardmode
-the game has a boring part which also happens to be at the start of hardmode where you need to be getting new items that takes awhile to get although there is some that dont take long
And thats about it. In general the game is really good, fun especially with friends, the developers listen to the comunity so i highly reccomend getting it, it might not be your type of game but if it is its worth the money.

9119,"It's Terraria, how could you hate it?

Jokes aside, the game is good for those who enjoy a quest to explore worlds, build structures across their worlds for new and (sometimes) helpful residents to live in or combating certain creatures that may attempt to invade your world! If you enjoy Minecraft regardless of what platform it is, you'll probably enjoy this especially since the two compliment and call each other out in a friendly way!

Pros:
+ Travel the world, find loot and improve your character, whether it's by finding a new material to make new tools and armor or by finding a accessory that improves your mobility such as a Grappling hook!

+ Make settlements and find people to move them in while also figuring out where they like and who they enjoy being around, netting you improvements like selling more stuff or even selling stuff at a cheaper price!

+ Enjoy the music the game has to offer! Especially since its great music and informs you of what area / biome you are in when you can't rely on visuals.

+ It's easy to host a Multiplayer game! just go to to the ""Multiplayer"" section and
 set up small settings, and boom, people can join through steam easily or you can set a password and invite them! Sidenote, you probably want a Large world for it, certainly not small.

+ In 1.4 you now have the option between the original character difficulties and then Journey difficulty which allows you to play the game at your own pace and way, controlling the weather, time of day, world difficulty and more! Of course this Journey difficulty is limited to Journey worlds so classic difficulties and Journey will remain separate.

+ Loading mods is easier than ever, going to Tmodloader on the store and using the ""Workshop"" section you can check out mods and download them from there, and don't sweat sharing a list if you want to play together, unless the mod isn't from the built in mod browser (haven't tested this so I wouldn't know.) 

Cons:
- Can be difficult, even on Classic world difficulty, unless you are experienced be prepared to die a lot.

- Game doesn't tell you a whole lot about where to go expect via what may be cryptic chat messages to some people and a NPC, The Guide who spawns with you in any world (expect certain special seeds)

- Remember the part where I mentioned dying? Unless you like looking at the spot you died in for 10 seconds, don't die if you can help it! (Not that anyone finds that advice helpful in video games.)

- Once you beat the final boss (ooo spooky and mysterious.) What you do from there is upto you, and depending on who you are may just cease playing, I guess if anything, that con is if anything is your fault.

My final score? 
I give it a 8.7 out of 10.
My experience comes from Console which I have 100% achievements / trophies for (atleast pre 1.3), maybe one day It'll be the same here, that's all for now, feel free to state opinions whether positive or negative."

This game is great and fun with friends and also gives you quite the challenge to do better next time you play but there is always at one point in the game where you are stuck and can't do anything because it's either not good enough armor or weapons and I think the game does that on purpose to help you get unstuck from that point and move on like sime things in life that seem bad.

Good game though would play again."

9393,"A challenging, fun, calm game that gives you the sense of adventure as you seek out new items, dangerous enemies and build structures along the way."
9394,"yes
"
9395,"When a game has over 750,000 positive reviews, you already know its amazing. Just do yourself a favour and install the Magic Storage mod because that makes the game even. better."
9396,its fun idk LOL
9397,Gud game
9398,"I loved this game, my first world was so fun. i spent so much time on it, then i bought a new computer and my data was lost. never really played it again. Really fun game though."
9399,"Its a very good game, buy it, play it."
9400,"I am a 44 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started Terraria and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories."
9401,Yeah is pretty good

9414,"Easily one of the best Indie games ever made. Buying the game with a one-time purchase, and getting infinite free ""final"" updates? It's the best price-to-high quality content ratio I've ever seen."
9415,I like how I go from missing Terraria to memorizing the entire wiki again every few months.

9483,"I have this game on Xbox, Switch, and now PC and all I have to say is that it is the best game in the world."
9484,"This game is amazing! It's kinda complicated to learn, but overall a great experience and worth the asking price!"
9485,Sitting in my base. Eyeball comes out of ground. I die. 10/10 would recommend.
9486,Fun
9487,great game
9488,"After only a couple hours of playing, i say its alright. One thing i have to say is good is that i can fight intergalactic gods, go to hell and back killing a wall made out of flesh, and kill walking goldfish."
9489,"The game is a versatile open world adventure which allows you to be the destroyer and creator of your own world. Customization is decent and building asthetics are quite well established. There is a great aspect which allows you to rescue other civilians and use them as your workstation so they can provide you with goods but with a cost of course. There are boss fights which bring excitement and challenge to the players adventure which is carried out with a wide variety of weapons never seen before in any other games. 
Although, I advise being careful with the Wall of Flesh boss. First make a VERY long platform in hell before spawning and go to the corner of the platform to spawn and use it to keep a distance from the wall and use bows to heavily damage it without having consequences. After finishing this boss you will enter a new, harder, more challenging world of more fun and so this game awaits your call.

If you found this helpful please rate and share and if you can please donate thanks for your help!"

9570,"Imagine what Minecraft might be like if it had been made with pixel art sprites and released in the SNES era. That sums up the overall vibe of Terraria pretty well. It also explains why I just can't seem to tear myself away from the darned thing. This devious little indie sandbox title borrows so many ideas from Notch's game that it essentially is Minecraft in 2D, but it also beefs up the familiar gameplay in exciting ways. There's a lot more creepy crawly stuff to kill, and the staggering number of doodads you can MacGyver together into deadly weapons to slay them with is mouth-watering. Say what you will; there's some gnarly fun to be had in these uncharted depths.

After you're done customizing your sprite character, Terraria dumps you on the colorful surface of a randomly generated pixel world with nothing more than a handful of tools and the vague sense that you're meant to build stuff, explore the terrain, and battle monsters. Figuring out exactly how that's done is a little puzzling at first. There's a lone guide wandering around the surface, though his advice is random. The lack of a tutorial meant I had to consult the game's Wiki page to get a better sense of how things work and what can be built. Even so, it didn't take long to get the gist. Though there aren't any real story elements or epic quests to conquer, the strong fantasy trappings instill a desire to adventure nonetheless. There's magic, monsters, and mayhem waiting both on the surface and in the dark caverns below. Uncovering unexpected new prizes and perils is a big part of the game's charm.

The entire game world is destructible, and breaking block lets you collect core resources like stone, wood, and iron that can be used to make cool gear or build structures. Rarer resources are dropped when you slay skeletons, floating fanged critters, and other monsters or when you dig deeper into the subterranean underworld. Since such a large portion of Terraria's gameplay revolves around foraging for different components and seeing what you can build with them, the drive to explore every nook and cranny of the landscape kicks in right away. But it's important to temper your desire to set out exploring in hopes of amassing huge quantities of loot with the pressing need to build shelter and expand your spawn point's home base.

Life on the surface follows a day/night cycle. Exploring topside during the daytime is safer ‚Äì you can pick flowers, roam around, chop trees, and kill weak slimes that roam too close. It's also a perfect time to build houses that serve as shelter and attract helpful NPC characters to your settlement. Things get dicey when night falls; zombie hordes and floating eyeball beasts come out in droves, forcing you to fight or flee. That's less of an issue once you get a sturdy settlement started.

The village development aspect of the game is a clever addition ‚Äì once you discover it exists. You can throw together bare-bones shacks or craft elaborate fortresses that tower upward into the heavens. Either way, you want to deck them out with enough accoutrements to lure NPCs to your village. These support characters can heal you, sell you items, and offer other helpful services. You have to complete a specific task to attract them, and even then they only appear if you've created a room (complete with walls, furniture, lighting, etc.) for them to stay. This offers some tangible incentives to spend time building, beyond the desire to lord over a large stronghold.


Having an elaborate and ever-expanding home base to return to on the surface is satisfying. However, the dark, foreboding underworld is where the real action is. Everything you need to make the most basic items like torches, furniture, and healing potions can be found near the surface, but you have to adventure deep below to uncover the rarest materials. This is where Terraria's gameplay feels more like an old-school action platformer and where it really sunk its hooks into me. Digging for ore eventually uncovers sprawling caverns that are home to many varieties of creepy creatures. Giant slimes, skeletons, burrowing worms, and tougher beasties roam the dark, and they often come charging at you while you're excavating. Exploring is a lot fun on its own, yet it's the strong emphasis on combat that's really appealing. For one thing, stopping to battle monsters breaks up the monotony of digging. Creatures also drop coins that can be used to buy shop items. There's an added risk versus reward element to combat too. Getting killed causes you to re-spawn on the surface with your gear intact, but you'll leave a chunk of your precious coin stash behind.

The real impetus behind adventuring is driven by the insanely deep gear crafting system. Almost everything you pick up in the game is a component used in forging some crucial piece of kit. There are well over a hundred different weapons and items to build. Though some equipment is more functional ‚Äì like protective armor, grappling hooks that lets you navigate with greater ease, and treasure chests for storing loot ‚Äì most of the stuff designed for cleaving monsters into itty bits is just sheer badass. Magical boomerangs, laser pistols, spell books that shoot fireballs, light sabers, and ninja stars are just a handful of the crazier weapons you can build. Hunting down the rare items you need to build the best weapons is obsession forming.

A few other cool nuances enhance the absorbing tasks of exploring, building, and battling away. Journey to the farther reaches of the surface world, and you'll inevitably run into The Corruption ‚Äì a teeming mass of demonic turf filled with extra danger and extra rewards. You'll also uncover demonic altars for forging special items that can be used to summon one of the game's three spectacular bosses to fight (sporting awesome names like ""Skeletron"" and ""Eater of Worlds""). Terraria's multiplayer mode is a blast too. Co-operatively exploring and building with friends or strangers is even more enjoyable than going solo, depending on the folks you play with. Finding an open public server to play on is a real drag, since most fill up within minutes of being posted on the game's forum. The good news is you can create your own server and share it with your pals (or post it online for others to join).
Verdict
Though on the surface it looks like just another ""me too"" indie game seeking to ride the coattails of Minecraft's success, Terraria expands on the familiar sandbox gameplay with a greater emphasis on combat and adventure that proves very satisfying. Fresh elements ‚Äì like an absurdly expansive weapon crafting system, a broader scope of monsters to battle, and a slick retro 2D presentation ‚Äì make it a stand out among the pack. Hell, it took all the resolve I could muster just to shut the game down long enough to write this review. That's rare indeed.

9571,game
9572,amazing game play every day even when I'm sad an amazing commutiy and memes
9573,pls gift me steam points

9576,Good game
9577,Yea its pretty rad
9578,one of the best games to exist on the planet. Relogic rep+
9579,"I never played this game before because I was so overwhelmed and intimidated by all of the stuff you need to collect and craft and whilst that still is a very daunting task, if you bring along at least one person who has a clue what they're doing then the experience can be very smooth. If you don't have a person though, still give it a chance you'd be surprised how quickly you can grow accustom to these systems"
9580,I recommend this game to players who like a challenge as you have a number of hard bosses throughout the game and have to find resources or extract them from the ground to defeat them. You can also relax and build a house or a hotel tor the many NPC's that are required to purchase items or things to make the house/base look a lot more pleasant. Basically the game is very fun and you should try it!

9623,"Best game ever, been playing since around 2012. I've probably played for more than 1000 hours combined on someone else's laptop but just recently got the opportunity to buy the game myself."
9624,"New to the game. But already had a lot of fun. 

On the Steam Deck though I get nausea, looks like a sort of motion sickness. And I get it real bad. First time by suprise, which ended vomiting on the toilet. After that I tried a time or 2 to play, but still I would feel get a little sick. Which probably is weird, since the game has been out for Nintendo Switch for way longer. But I still would think that it has to do with a lot of info on a small screen,(in combination with) maybe the the right-mouse pad. Something my brain can't comprehend anyway.

Downvoted so this maybe get read. Can't be the only one?

While typing this I was thinking that I should look up the Switch button layout and so, to see if and where there a differences between that and the Deck version."

Have you ever wanted to destroy an ancient guardian that guards the secrets to summoning said eldritch god?
Have you ever wanted to mine for 20 mins at a time to get to hell willingly?
Have you ever wanted to watch all of your hard get destroyed in about 30 mins because you forgot to spray a rock with a green solution of undisclosed ingredients that can also alter an entire ecosystem in a few seconds???
 Well then Terraria is the game for you!!!"

9692,This game is amazing and I am having fun progressing in my character and my knowledge for the game. My unpopular opinion that the music feels off to me and kind of eldritch gives off a nice ambiance to the game. So many thing to do in this game and learn. If you were to learn everything there is so many other things to do like play in a server or with mods. Highly recommend and worth it if you like survival sandbox games.

9764,"I remember playing through terraria for the first time, I had no idea how anything worked.

I think what kept me stuck to this game was the sheer excitement I had for every boss fight as each and everyone of them was so well designed, the first time I fought Wof I bloody Shit myself as my friend had told me to build a long bridge out of platforms across hell.

Not telling me a f!cking demonic flesh wall was going to awaken, 
anyways my thoughts on this game.

100/10 must buy, you know an almost 12 year old game that costs 10 dollars is good when people some people have over 1k hours of playtime.

The art style of this game is some of the most visually pleasing stuff I have ever seen, 

there is so much content and so much to do, 

the only issue I can think of for this game is that when you kill the Moonlord unless you want to grind for Zenith and other stuff, you don't really have much to do besides base building

And yeah sure you can just go on tmod but I feel that original terraria  is just better even though mods add heaps, 

I feel like the simplicity of terraria is just perfect 

First you start building a wooden box with a workbench and chair, the guide opens the door during night time and gets your innards get turned into outtards you expand make armour,and better weapons 

And then you get the infamous
""You Feel An Evil Presence Watching You""

You kill a blue slime who has obviously taken slot of supplements

You explore your world seeking loot, you find a dungeon.
Of course you jump headfirst into the dungeon and the dungeon guardian massacres you

You fight either a brain that summons illusions that a bloody 4 year old could see through, or a long ass worm

Then you fight an oversized bee

Then a lanky skeleton

You build a hell bridge and fight a literal wall of flesh

Your world enters hard mode, you destroy the evil altars around your world,granting you powerful ores.

You fight huge mechanical worm that massacres all your npcs, a pair of eyeballs and a four armed metal skeleton.

You explore the jungle and find a funny plant and try pick it up...

You kill the oversized plant

And open the door to a trap filled temple you narrowly navigate through till you accidentally summon a literal golem that will punch the shit out of you,

You kill some cultists and fight a dragon summoning one

Then celestial creatures invade you kill them and...

Impending Doom Approaches...

You kill low budget cythulu and congrats, you won the game.

PS thanks for reading all of this sorry I made it so long.

"
9765,"Terraria is a masterpiece.
And it makes me so happy to see the work and love for this game that the devs have put in.

Wish I could experience playing it for the first time again, spending a whole summer discovering all the things this game has to offer."

9779,Good stuff for a Good gamer
9780,"This is honestly one of the greatest games I have played. I hate it when people say this is a minecraft copy because they clearly have not played it. Terraria has so much you can do but not only that it has so much you NEED to do to be able to progress. Yes in games like minecraft there is a lot to do but there is not a lot do which you actually NEED to. This is my favourite thing about terraria; It took my a full 2 weeks on grinding it for about 8 hours a day with my friend to actually complete it. Terraria is also one of those games is that playing through the first time is something specail, having to learn everything. I could not progress without having to use the wiki half the time. Also is that once you complete it the first time, the differnt difficultys are so much different. Classic and expert Terraria are two different experiences. Even after deafting the moon lord, there is still so much to do which is still engaging for example getting the zenith (where i belief the game ends). In conculsion, terraria for me, will go down as one of the greatest games of all time because of how well its made, its not like call of duty where having 2000 hours means you have been doing the same thing, Terraria 2000 hours always has you doing something different which actually means something."
9781,good
9782,gud game
9783,"The reason I'm making this review is because I believe that the unmodded version of Terraria is an absolute pain in terms of grinding. The issue isn't necessarily the drop chances or spawn chances, but how frequent they appear throughout a playthrough, and how they feel almost required when playing master mode. The reason I say unmodded is because I think that tmodloader fixes every single issue that the vanilla game has. Many items and recipes that improve QOL are added with mods like Calamity or Luiafk. Instead of grinding for an ankh charm, a lot of it can be crafted. Infinite potions, torches, instant hellevator, etc. take away (IMO) the least fun part of the game. Not to mention that mods are encouraged, supported, and tmodloader, from my experience, improves optimization. I lag quite a bit with certain programs open in the background while I play the base game, but I have NEVER had that issue with tmodloader.

If you buy Terraria, you shouldn't restrict yourself to just the core game, IMO mods are what really do make this game perfect."
9784,GREAT ASS MUDDA FUACKING GAME GET IT RIGHT NOW BOZO IF U DONT HAVE TERRARIA WHAT THE HELL R U DOING WITH UR GOD DAMN LIFE THATS WHY U MUSTY BOZO GET TERRARIA BECOME GIGA CHADDDDDD

The sandbox portion of the game can rival Minecraft and possibly even out-do it, But if I had to recommend one part of this game to someone, it would be the community. The community of this game is outstanding and no other game community could stand up to it.

9821,"I personally love Terraria. Though, I only recently started playing it, (as in I've literally just started playing as of a couple months ago) and I do have to say one important factor of Terraria; it is not very new player accessible. Now what do I mean by that? I mean that it is a very big and complex game and doesn't give a whole lot of explanation as to what to do. Now, this isn't a huge point against the game, it just means that players that are new will have a lot of trouble trying to figure things out and get their bearings. Though, that isn't too bad. It is just a frustrating experience to figure out the game but ultimately, once you have gotten things figured out, it is a great game for casual play and focused gameplay!"

9825,Simply a classic.

9829,this is really exciting an great game for someone who haves thirst for adventure and have patience on building several good houses so your world dont look bad i highly reccomend it specially with friends its really fun to play with your friends and have several funny times and even experience glitches with eachoother  really fun! dont matter the glitches dont matter anything this game still good and i highly reccomend it :D

9840,Very good
9841,Terraria is a fun action packed game. Unlike what people say it is nothing like 2D minecraft as is has more resources and weapons. Keep in mind this game is fun single player but multiplayer is where Terraria peeks.  Would highly recommend
9842,2D minecraft but not like minecraft
9843,yes
9844,game copied call of duty
9845,"I love this game with all my heart. I played this game since 1.2 on my old iPad and I enjoyed it from beginning to end. The amount of content that developers make is insane, I like how they even made a crossover with Dungeon Defenders 2 and Don't Starve Together (even though I never played them). It might be confusing if it's your first time playing this game (now that I think about it, I think it would have been nice if they made an in-game tutorial instead of constantly looking at the wiki) but if you really get in to it, trust me you'll love this game as much as I do. Highly recommend it, it's cheap, better if you play with friends, and It will forever be my favorite Steam game."
9846,"Terraria is really much a good game! i didn't play it as much a ppg but who cares...
To me, terraria is kinda ""addicting"" of some sort but if you like it you like it
it's not me to choose if you like a game or not"
9847,juegal
9848,Honestly a great game
9849,"I grew up playing this game.  It's such a timeless, fun, endlessly exciting experience and no other game feels so rewarding after you beat it.  This and minecraft are classics that everybody should play through at least once."
9850,GOOD
9851,"I finally beat the last boss so I suppose I should leave a review already! It's a good game, one of the games that made me get Steam when it came out, it's really fun to play through it alone or with friends! One of the most genius things about Terraria is how you could grind gear to overcome challenges, or just make an even better arena to fight the bosses in, most of the time there's several options for how to overcome the next challenge, and I love that. The sandbox elements and rpg elements work together wonderfully, and it feels very rewarding to accomplish your goals in Terraria. c:"

9862,It really fun and chill. It like 2D side scrolling minecraft but lots more entertainment for you.
9863,Best game on steam
9864,It's Terraria. Its one of those games you've probably heard a friend talk about atleast once. It has simplistic depth that the team has added for free for a decade only further making this game a real gem. Very few games are ever worth your money at launch. Even fewer add to the base game for all platforms for free. This company is a real darling and deserve a look if you happened to not catch it yet.

9925,It's a great game! Would recommend.
9926,this game cool
9927,"I would recommend this game to all gamers especially ones that like explorer games such as Minecraft, Stardew Valley or Archvale. Although the 2 dimensional aspect can limit the game in ways it makes it difficult to have a SMP like in Minecraft. It has a great amount of replayability and is very fun with friends or without. Everyone should try this game. I love this game and have played for probably almost 1500 hours across all platforms. I began playing on my Ipad in 2016 back in 1.2 version of the game and i know this game in and out. Definitely recommend, 9/10 game!"

9931,Very fun with friends too
9932,good
9933,"Ive played well over 1000 hours between my xbox and steam. My friend got me into it but before i had not really liked it because i always saw it as 2D minecraft. But after playing this game for months on end, I have grown to appreciate this game. I now love it more than minecraft."
9934,it sure is a game
9935,A great game full of good times.
9936,me and bf. make house and defeat gods.
9937,amazing!
9938,"Absolutely fantastic, this game has unfailing replay-ability with 101 ways of advancing in every single step. The game is excellent both for if you want to speedrun certain objectives or prepare as much as possible and farm for rare pickups. Expert Mode and Master Mode are a lot of fun and genuinely challenging - and multiplayer only adds to the fun. After having the game for years I'm still finding out about new things; the game is littered with rare loot, and expertly intertwined puns...!"
9939,"Read the wiki.

9962,best game everv so fun especly clamity mod
9963,really funny game but the moonlord is so hard and u have to watch some vids
9964,My boyfriend got me hooked on this game and honestly it is the most fun we have had playing together in a game.
9965,nice
9966,It has unicorns. What more could you ask for?
9967,play this for free candy and v-bucks then hop in my van
9968,Pretty epic.
9969,.
9970,Hell yeah. HARD one. I recommend.
9971,It's pretty good
9972,"AMAZING!! simply AMAZING!!! I would definitely recommend this game to others. It can be a little slow at first but is soooooo much fun, from the late night grind's with friends to digging dirt for and hour it has a range of things for many people to like, for example the classes... if you want to get up nice and close with your enemies do the most damage and take the most hits, melee is for you! if that's not your speed and you want to hit your enemies without them hitting you, range class. If you like cool spells and other stuff magic class has some really nice weapons, and finally for our laziest players the summoner class this class lets you summon in swords, dragons, even bats to fight for you!"
9973,Very Cool
9974,I put a little bit of time into this game on all platforms. But this game has horrible graphics and that just ruins the quality of the game imo.
9975,"better if you get tmodloader but regular terreria still really fun
"
9976,its fiya
9977,"Absolute beauty of a game. Has supplied me with over 1500 hours of gameplay (the rest on the tmodloader DLC). I really hope this is the first ever game to hit 1 million positive reviews, so this is my contribution"
9978,"It's basically like minecraft but 2d, I got it from my cousin and paid nothing back. Early game and mid game can be a bit boring but once you get the zenith, it gets super good. :D"
9979,L angler W game
9980,Fun alone and with friends
9981,.
9982,"fun multiplayer game, challenging too."
9983,Literally my #1 favorite game of all time. Nothing more for me to say.
9984,i love this game its so fun and has crazy stuff in it i wish it has a tutorial tho :(
9985,Good as hell
9986,"Very nice, Adhd approved"
9987,luv playing with boyfriend!!!!!!!!! real not fake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9988,"i saw a chest with 3 dart traps beside it. i broke the dart traps and then figured it was safe to open the chest. turns out mr. booby trap maker put a giant bomb underground that would explode when i opened the chest. came back and all the chest had was a sweater. 10/10 would (will) get baited again
edit: i found another chest with dart traps beside it so once again, i broke the traps, dug down and found a bomb and broke that, and turns out there were TWO BOMBS that i had to get rid of. the chest had the exact same sweater in it"
9989,S'alright
9990,banger
9991,.
9992,"This is a fanastic game, especially  if you are looking for something to play with your SO. The monsters are still difficult and interesting and varied, but the 2d combat is very nice for newbs such as myself, who can barely play Mariokart decently.  Farming, fishing, Destroying evil monsters, getting the ham salad smacked out of you by bats -- Terraria has it all, and manages to make a game that is perfect for seasoned gamers as well as those who have no skill. Not to mention that the NPC's are fantastically varied, the biomes are gorgeous,  building materials are varied and cool. I am hooked!"
9993,amongus
9994,"very yummy game and it is easy to learn.

10003,yes
10004,"when you fight the eye of cthulhu:
""there's literally a cemetery right by my house."""
10005,Base Terraria is very fun and mods turn the game up from an 8/10 to a 10/10. Lots of fun with progression and bosses are challenging. The community keeps improving with more user and developer created content. I would recommend this game to many of my friends.
10006,very fun always like it
10007,fun game
10008,"brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr gun worm ""hug"" nap time"

10023,it's just a great game to play solo or with friends always something to do or build
10024,"Wonderful game that I've put hundreds of hours into and have been playing for years now. Would recommend to everyone and anyone, a thoroughly enjoyable little experience that just gets better with time (unless you're doing the angler achievements). :)"

10027,goo d
10028,"What can I say its just masterpiece I absolutely love this game. Some say that its 2D minecraft but they are absolutely WRONG this game is much more than that. It maybe is 2D game but the feeling that you get playing it are amazing. The exploring, the boss fights everything is just masterfull. If you thinking ""Should I buy this game ?"" My answer is yes BUY it its really worth the money."
10029,Just good. highly recommend.
10030,GOOD
10031,"A must play game, highly recommend."
10032,"how do i beat the tutorial?????
"
10033,"This game got gifted to me from a friend and i cant stop playing it since. Its a grate game to play with friends and family. You get to build, explore, mine, fight etc. No need to feel alone in this game you can have pets too!

When I start out it felt like i cant do any thing but i asked the guide npc and my friend for help they got me started.

Cool music too but i hope you love this game as much as i do.

Goodbye!"

10058,Masterpiece
10059,The underground dessert still haunts me
10060,Its a fun and entertaining game if you play with friends and not rush through it. I would recommend playing with a small group and maybe trying to defeat some hidden bosses as they were the most fun for me.
10061,"Best 10$ ever spent! Honestly an amazing game, it takes the sandbox and replayability of games like minecraft and adds an easy to follow progression system and story, with bosses and stronger gear each time one is defeated, and different classes possibilities. I usually don't play with friends in Terraria, and yet it is my most played game. Would recommend to anybody!"
10062,PRETTY GUD
10063,a great game worth a try
10064,its just a very fun and enjoyable game

10070,"it is very fun, even when you play on your own, Normally when you are playing a game, playing with your friend is very fun, but in this game you can play on your own, and with a friend! It is fun for your friend and yourself to be in a call, and both of you guys play singleplayer, its a fun suprise when you hear what your friends have gotten!"

10081,adea
10082,"299 hours wasted of my life accidentally deleted this this game at everything is gone only stuff i have left is the achievements dosent matter though
but still good"
10083,"Little to no explanation of what to do in the game so you either have to rely on friends or the terraria wiki to craft some stuff and progress. Once you enter hardmode, after defeating a certain boss which you need to create like an arena for so you can properly defeat him, you spend pretty much all your time farming items and looking for ores so you can craft better gear to fight the bosses which basically just get a lot more hp and do a lot of damage, rinse and repeat. Apart from exploring the world early on it's really boring. Most of the time I had no idea where to go next to advance in the game. If you don't know what to do in your life and want to waste a lot of hours go ahead an play it, but I don't so I have no use for this trash game."
10084,Certainly well spent time
10085,fun
10086,very chill game
10087,its a amazing game about building and fighting big bosses really fun game highly recommended

10125,"Terraria is the very first game I've ever bought, and I can tell now how worth it it is. I haven't been able to find a game more fun than this one, and it's also the game that helped me get used to playing on PC since I used to mostly play on phones, and in the past, on consoles.

Best game. 1000/10. Absolutely recommend."

10182,Fun one buy U won't regret. more than 2d minecraft.
10183,"i dont really have much experience of the game, but the game is very fun with friends and you never get bored. But for new players fandom ( https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Terraria_Wiki ) is the best option. i will rate the game solid 8.789997/10"
10184,"Terraria is an awesome sandbox builder fighting survival PvE game that I definitely recommend. The game has 97% positive reviews, so you don't have to think twice to buy it if you are into such a genre. My personal favourite side of the game is that you can play it as an idle game, where you just go into caves, and dig endlessly, go back to the base and give the loot to your friend to make you stuff. The game can be played on long sessions but it may become boring after a certain amount of time. 8/10."
10185,"fricking luv this game

10191,such a good game
10192,Funny block game with the golden shower and no 1.19 level moderation

10209,Best game forever but too short for me.
10210,I enjoy playing this with friends but I really hate the grinding in some parts of this game. 6/10
10211,"i dont fukcing klnow why i bought this game
"
10212,i set my quick heal key to the same key as my screenshot key. i now have quite a few screenshots.
10213,very fun

10219,Small genitalia.
10220,super fun especially with friends
10221,funy
10222,game is f.u.n
10223,"I just had a very negative play experience, not that it detracts from the game, because I have already played it all before, And will say it is very good.

Why negative? First night is crucial, get a house around you ASAP.. there will be too many zombies and eyes to deal with, plus the slimes are still spawning. But you do 2 damage to the zombies.. And their HP bar is over 88 or something strong. What am I supposed to do, I wonder, Is it like beating the bottom boss, where the overworld is more dangerous than the underworld?

It surely feels like I should be propelled to go lower to escape these hard fought foes of the surface to get down under as far as i can go. Constantly propelled towards progress.

But there is no breathing room anymore...."
10224,"This game always is fun to play with friends. Having played from before Hardmode was a thing up until what it has become now has been a joy. I would always recommend this game to someone, especially if you can get the 4-pack on sale and spread the cheer to others. I always feel like this game has a challenge no matter how many times it has been played. Solo is a fun experience but joining with friends is a real treat. I am forever glad I found this game and hope others can fall in love with it as well."
10225,"I have been playing this game for several years, and I have had an amazing experience. The developers are amazing, and they constantly interact with the community, which itself is amazing."
10226,I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT
10227,try fishing
10228,"This is one of my favorite games, I have a ton of hours on console, and own it on PC as well. Try it out, it is a little difficult at first, but try out journey mode and toggle it to classic mode. Play it for a bit and try to beat the game with god mode off. Its a fun game filled with lots of stuff. I would say an average run probably takes me about 20 hours while I'm taking a bit of time but I am a bit experienced. It will probably take you about 30-40 hours to beat the final boss. Dont be afraid of looking things up on the wiki. The game is huge and has tons of items, bosses, events and armors. The game has around 16 bosses I think, 8 of which are required, but really 9 to be able to get good loot to kill the other bosses."
10229,this game is cool and HARD but still fun because it has like 10000 items and animals and it has a collectcen of thing you can collect as the same (:

10260,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
10261,Love it.

10263,fun
10264,Its swag!

10405,"It's extremely fun to progress, but if you plan on watching guides to go through the game (especially weapon and accessory related) I suggest playing the game on expert for your first run.  If you don't play a lot of games and are looking for a casual experience then you don't have to, but if you plan to be able to be killed by any boss in the game (especially while playing with melee gear), I suggest that harder difficulty because I just went through a playthrough, where I could just tank anything simply with vampire knifes and sitting there.  Died on the destroyer once and thats it."

10424,"Honestly, this game was a massive part if my childhood ad to see it grow in features and popularity is absolutely insane.

10481,10/10
10482,its very good
10483,This game is great. It's a classic and a must-have. It was the first game I purchased on steam. It is filled with tons of magical items and lore that really make for a great game and experience. It is very fun and the music will always bring me nostalgia.
10484,"Terraria may look like Minecraft but it's way more than that.

before we start, on the main menu there are single-player and multiplayer there the main modes. You can change your in-game character to make it look as you like it. When making a world you can choose two world types corruption and crimson both have many enemies and one unique boss for each. There 4 difficulties, journey, classic, expert and master. The journey is for people who want an easy experience playing Terraria. Classic is Classic. Expert is for people wanting a harder experience playing Terraria. (not made for new players) Master is for the best of the best, the hardest difficulty in the game bosses have more health, new attacks and new tricks.

you can make your world small, medium and large. Now you are ready to start playing, there 3 parts of the game non-hardcore, hardcore and endgame. Non-hardcore is the start of the game, the beginning. There are a few bosses lots of armour, weapons and enemies. Then it's a hardcore must of the game. Tons of new bosses, weapons, armour, ores and the final boss after that it's the endgame where you can do whatever you want, what you like to create in OUR world lots of stuff to do even when you finish the game.

There are lots of fish quests and multiple classes to play as. lots of events like a blood moon or a winter event. The pixel art is so beautiful, that anyone could like it. the work they put into just the art is amazing and the music is even better. You can listen to it for hours.

Now multiplayer, there are some servers you can play for PVP or to play with your friends.

There are also mods in the mod loader to easily get mods if you get bored of the main game with huge mods or quality of life mods or just simple mods. 

The game is very cheap and goes on sale a lot of times, For me, it's 10.99$CAD for the game in Canada, 9.99$US and 6.99$pounds. If I would make a rating of this game I would give it a

9.4/10 and a Canadian maple leaf :)"
10485,"Really fun game with a lot of content like weapons, armor, enemies, intense bosses, and even decorative things"
10486,"Although over the years Terraria has been overhyped in terms of the quality, it is still one of the best 2D games you can play, with a combination of a detailed artstyle and well thought bosses, it definitely stands as one of the greatest games in the large cast that is Adventure games, and that is a title no-one can diminish. Amazing Job."
10487,GOOD
10488,yum yum in my tum tum
10489,great
10490,its ight
10491,terraria is a fun pixel game that you can think you spent 20 minutes on when in reality youve spent hours. there is near infinite things to do and no one goal making it easy to do anything you want

10556,"Everyone should play Terraria, phenominal game, amazing amounts of content, truly an absolute masterpiece."
10557,"GIT GUD.
GETTING GUD."
10558,"If you are OK with very simple graphics, the game has a lot to offer in terms of content. This can be a pro, since it runs in many notebooks and not so powerful machines.

It is not easy to find out how to build stuff, and you will likely need to do your homework on specialized websites and wikis. You will probably need help to find out how to summon bosses.

The good and fun parts are the exploration and the option to play multiplayer. This is what makes the game shine."

10601,gsd
10602,This new minecraft update is pretty cool.
10603,Played it many times on Console and the PC version just improved it more. Along with Mincecraft and Rimworld-- Terraria is one of the greatest sandbox RPG/survivals to ever exist
10604,"the green part of my rainbow hat keeps dissapearing>:(
"
10605,"I am a 55 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
10606,Good game
10607,"fun

10608,"Ive played more hours outside of steam and it's an experience to play and do with the right people!

10705,best game of all time
10706,"Had to cheese final boss. I didn't like that. It got genuinely frustrating and annoying to play the game. I had to build a money farm and a box to put NPCs in, and hit the boss through walls, just to win. I admit I'm not the best gamer in the world. But I feel like, if I beat every single boss in a game through hard work and perseverance and dying many many MANY times, only to come up against a nigh-unkillable wall, where even after grinding for hundreds of hours and getting the best level (until that point) gear, I couldn't come close to defeating... That's not really a balanced boss. The game went from Zelda to Dark Souls REAL quick. That massively brought down my level of enjoyment. So even though I finally beat it, and I also plan on a modded playthrough now, I still can't in good conscience recommend it to other people.  Unless ridiculously massive difficulty spikes are your thing, I guess."

10716,"Terraria is a beautiful game yet it has such a simple style. There are endless things to do in your time playing this game by collecting cool items, weapons, armor and more. There are countless boss fights to test your skill and even holiday events to add something different around those times of year. Overall, the time and effort pays off and allows for countless hours to try new strategies, character builds, and much more. This game is amazing and I recommend it to anyone willing to give up some time to get into the game."

10774,"I've heard about this game on and off over the years, and I've always been curious to try it and I finally bought it this month. I would like to say it was DEFINITELY worth the price! I did buy it on sale, but if I ever had to buy it again I wouldn't mind paying full price now that I've experienced it.

In the beginning I had a lot of WTF moments because of all the enemies and the things I discover in this game, but that's something that makes it fun. It has a large assortment of items and biomes, as well as enemies and friendly critters, and the designs and ideas don't feel old! They're pretty creative. It didn't take too long for me to figure out the basics, the guide being there is also a huge help for figuring out what to do. It was overwhelming at first because there was A Lot of new stuff to me and so much to do, but as I played more it felt more manageable but still a good level of challenging!

I lost my train of thought, but this is my current obsession so it's safe to say I love it"

10779,One of my faves ever!!!
10780,Great game!
10781,"Great game. Can be both a chill game and a demanding game depending on the difficulty you play on. Extra difficulties (especially master mode) add a few layers of difficulty while also giving the player some benefits (though not many benefits in master mode), which makes for a more interesting experience. Fun both by yourself and with friends. Highly recommend!"

10804,"Its a fun game, I play with my friends highly recommend to play with others it makes the game more fun and cool concept on a game with adding survival aspects and bosses to the game."
10805,"super early game kinda sucks, but once you get past that it's a 10/10 game"
10806,Good game. I hope I don't spent my whole life playing it.
10807,fun
10808,red eye ball

10820,"This is one of the greats. I will find my way back to this game every few months and dump another hundred hours on it. Labor, and love from the dev team have created a wholly unique experience in the form of Terraria.

10832,I didnt like the jiggler
10833,"so i played this game on my mobile phone together with my besto friendo and i already loved it. but a while ago, we wanted to play it again with another person on pc. i think it was one of the best ideas i had in the last months, because it was much better than the mobile version (which was already very good) and we had a lot of fun. basically you¬¥re fighting bosses, farming materials to get better equipment and trying to get throug different areas with different enemies. it has very nice little references to other games and fandoms, like minecraft or don¬¥t starve. its definitely worth the money and you¬¥re easy going to play more than a hundred hours (which i didn¬¥t because i knew very much from the mobile version). 

have fun"
10834,the grinding never stops
10835,"Honestly one of the most fun to play games, and it just gets better with friends. The fact that there is so many good mods to improve Terraria makes it even better. This game has followed through my childhood and is still amazing to this day."
10836,Empty grind so that you can unlock another empty grind so that you can unlock another empty grind so that you can unlock another empty grind so that you can unlock another empty grind so that you can unlock another empty grind so that you can unlock another empty grind so that you can unlock another empty grind so that you can unlock another empty grind so that you can unlock another empty grind so that you can unlock another empty grind.
10837,"This game is great, although I do kinda understand why people some times calls it a rip off minecraft or something.  Even though it's nothing like that game.  But the weapons are great in this and the new bosses added in 1.4 do like nice.  Just seems like the game kinda got remastered when that came out.  I originally played it on the Xbox 360 but maybe 5-7 (Can't remember)  When I got a pc I bought it on steam right when the game was on sale, for around $5 I think.  But like I said the bosses are great especially in hard mode, like the Empress of Light and the mechanical bosses.  But once you finish the game you could start modding it too in tmodloader which I think recently got updated to 1.4 too."

10917,Very fun game and very nostalgic bosses are very fleshed out and the game has lots of content and the mods are also very fun with tModLoader
10918,"I'm playing the game knowing very little and I judge a game off of that. I did like the start of it but man it gets boring quick trying to find minimal progress after hours of nothing.

Pros
-music
-art style
-beginning is pretty fun

cons
-the transition in difficulty after wall of flesh is not smooth at all. The next set of bosses are extremely tough and spawn very quick afterwards.
-it's taking me tons of hours to make minimal progress
-looking anything up because of how obscure it is or the lack of direction it gives you is bad game design

EDIT: Normal does not scale regardless if it's one player or 2+ people. This game is definitely fun with friends because there is no scaling so everything is a ton easier but playing alone and for the first time it's garbage."
10919,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
10920,This game is probably the best survival game ever made. Putting this game on Steam is one of Spinks' best moments.

10955,"This game goes out of its way to punish players using 21:9 aspect monitors.

I recently changed to a 21:9 when my old 16:9 broke. Little did I know that the developers of Terraria were so colossally petty as to deliberately make their game de facto incompatible with 21:9 monitors. They could have just added black bars to the sides of the game screen like any game that was developed before 21:9s, but instead they created a forced zoom that shrinks the entire field of vision to far less than what you would get on a 16:9, thus making the game nearly unplayable, and certainly not enjoyable. Their flawed logic: 21:9 monitors give an unfair advantage in multiplayer. Except I don't play multiplayer. And more importantly, by shrinking the field of view in 21:9 to less than what players on 16:9 get, they are giving an unfair advantage to 16:9 players.

It's 2022 people. There are no ""wide"" monitors. There are no ""ultra-wide"" monitors. There are just monitors, and they come in all shapes and sizes.

Yes, I know that there's a mod to fix this. I don't care. The devs can take their deliberately broken game and shove it where the sun don't shine."
10956,"Its NOT a minecraft rip off. just because there is grass and zombies, doesnt make it minecraft. Terraria is FAR more than minecraft."

for example, in the game you face many challenges like the zombies, and flying eyeballs at night .{You can't use beds to skip nights, only to set your spawn}Though if your in a situation that you may not come out alive from, you can use an item called the magic mirror to teleport to your spawn.I recommend that anyone that does'nt have the game, go to www.gameiki.com and look at all the items and bosses and everything in the game, and don't forget, soon the new update is coming out!!! üòÑ {It's Monday 7/25/22}"

Nevertheless this game is a BLAST to play with friends and you'll probably be up at 3 A.M. with your buds catching animals with a bug net and selling them to the black market creating a capitalist society forging an empire and becoming gods of this feeble game."

11098,"Terraria takes some time to get used to, but once you get used to it, you can't stop having fun. It is basically a whole journey packed into a neat little game. It has so many Items, Enemies, Bosses - You name it! You should definitely try it for yourself. Love it :D"
11099,"good

11100,yes

11102,I would totally recommend this game as it is very fun and open. You can do anything and do it with friends.
11103,"The most relaxing and adventurous game you can ever play in my opinion , a wide variety of bosses , weapons loot and more. Keeps my me occupied for when I really need it and still keeps my creative juices flowing. Best all around game , definitely recommend to a person of any age or gender."

11105,yes
11106,yes it is one of my favourite games even if you get bored you you can take a break and play it later and even then you can get T-mod loader witch is free and have even more fun i hope you find this game as awesome as I do enjoy terria
11107,"  just play it
"
11108,"Terraria is by far the best 2D game I've ever played. At first, I thought it was just a boring, nothing-game. As I continued to play however, I found that I had become addicted. This game is WAY better than you would think. I also love the references to other games and movies that they slipped in there. Over all, this game is worth every penny and I highly recommend it!"

11126,"Really cool game, awesome boss fights a wide array of character customizations that you can add to your character which keeps the game fresh. There's a lot to do and with the calamity mod you can add even more content if you've finished the game and want to go for a 2nd play through. I've played for a little bit and have had a great time this game is one of those that you really should play. However I have no friends to recommend it to so gg i guess"

11152,"This game terraria Is incredibly unique and fun! you start off in a forest with basic tools, and have to survive, but you'll quickly realize that there is a dark magical side to this world..

this game has really easy and customizable controls, really great action and boss fights, and 4 different classes of weapons so its a new experience every time you replay it! 
Overall this is one of my favorite video games of all time, and im adicted!

Terraria is a 4.5/5 game"
11153,"An amazing game that whenever I come back to no matter the period of time I spend a good chunk of the month playing. It's that enjoyable. Between four classes, A dozen and more bosses to fight, Hundreds of items to collect and many things to build to it's no surprise this game has become a personal favourite.

I thought this game was long finished since 1.1. When the mechanical bosses were the very last bosses to fight in the game but here we are on the horizon of 1.5. A game made with so much love and care I'm so glad they stuck with it, That it is what it is today. 

Considering how cheap it is, Here's the question. What are doing not playing it? Do it now! Play it now!"
11154,amazing game. so many ways to play the game and theres atleast 100+ hours of good boss content. 10/10

11197,furry girl
11198,Its alright
11199,"It's not Minecraft so don't expect that it plays much differently and is much more fleshed out and thorough in many more aspects of the game. The trade off being that the world is not infinite, but, you can create infinite worlds still, and take characters from one world to another, which allows you to gather materials outside of a main world to make it look beautiful, and keep it natural looking, or it allows you create separate worlds for separate purposes, transferring items between them. I think the two dimensional playstyle is a lot more fun and allows the developers to expand on many other aspects of the game not to mention it consistently runs well on all devices, even older ones that aren't really good for gaming. Plus it is easier to download worlds and mods for than anything else I've played with just a simple YouTube tutorial it took me about 5 minutes.  Phenomenal game with many great attributes about it, and plays smoothly on all devices. Would recommend to anyone with a lot of time on their hands who is open to playing a game with ""retro graphics""."

11242,"Terraria is a game pack with content even more so  for a completionist, the items you can get and the bosses you fight are fun. However, the game can get a bit tedious but in the end its all worth it for the feeling that comes from finally beating a boss you had trouble with before."

11436,"Put 5,000+ hours into this game, only for it to give me a horrendous game-breaking glitch. For some reason, whenever I left-click to use items to mine or to use my sword, in Journey Mode, it just opens up an array of menus in vertical order that have the symbols of a yellow,red,blue box, a gear wheel, a clock, a fist, a painting, and a skull. I can't back out of this for some reason, even when I open up Settings to Exit the game. I tried reinstalling, and even Alt+Clicking some items to favorite them ('cuz other than opening up uncloseable menus, the game also thinks I'm trying to throw stuff). Nothing has changed this. 
Hope the game gets a good fixing, 'cuz I'm tapping out."
11437,pretty fun game
11438,"Character created and world generated in 2015. Finally beat the Moon Lord today. The fact that I was able to come back to a 7+ year old save and progress it incrementally over the years without any save breaks, character stat or inventory loss, or world state loss while they were doing major version upgrades is definitely a sign that Re-Logic was worthy getting the Labor of Love award. Terraria is one of the few games I would love to forget and fall in love playing again, so that I could relive the joys of discovering new biomes, new gear, new bosses and that feeling of finally defeating a boss and getting access to all the new goodies. Can't wait to see what 1.4.4 has for us! I might play through it again once that update drops and finally get some better inventory management (if you know, you know :P)."

11476,"Fighters of land, sea and air, Blackshirts of the revolution and of the legions, men and women of Italy, of the empire
and of the Kingdom of Albania, listen!
The hour destined by fate is sounding for us. The hour of irrevocable decision has come. A declaration of war
already has been handed to the Ambassadors of Great Britain and France.
We take the field against the plutocratic and reactionary democracies who always have blocked the march and
frequently plotted against the existence of the Italian people.
Several decades of recent history may be summarized in these words: Phrases, promises, threats of blackmail, and
finally, crowning that ignoble edifice, the League of Nations of fifty-two nations.
Our conscience is absolutely clear.
With you, the entire world is witness that the Italy of fascism has done everything humanly possible to avoid the
tempest that envelops Europe, but all in vain. It would have sufficed to revise treaties to adapt them to changing
requirements vital to nations and not consider them untouchable for eternity.
It would have sufficed not to begin the stupid policy of guarantees, which proved particularly deadly for those who
accepted them. It would have sufficed not to reject the proposal of the Fuehrer [Hitler] made last October 6 after the
campaign in Poland ended.
Now all that belongs to the past.
If today we have decided to take the risks and sacrifices of war, it is because the honor, interests, and future firmly
impose it since a great people is truly such if it considers its obligations sacred and does not avoid the supreme trails
that determine the course of history.
We are taking up arms, after having solved the problem of our continental frontiers. We want to break the territorial
and military chains that confine us in our sea because a country of 45,000,000 souls is not truly free if it has not free
access to the ocean.
This gigantic conflict is only a phase of the logical development of our revolution. It is the conflict of poor,
numerous peoples who labor against starvers who ferociously cling to a monopoly of all riches and all gold on earth.
It is a conflict of fruitful, useful peoples against peoples who are in a decline. It is a conflict between two ages, two
ideas.
Now the die is cast and our will has burned our ships behind us.
I solemnly declare that Italy does not intend to drag other peoples bordering on her by sea or land into the conflict.
Switzerland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, and Egypt, take note of these words of mine. It depends on them and only
on them if these words are rigorously confirmed or not.
Italians, in a memorable mass meeting in Berlin, I said that according to the rules of Fascist morals when one has a
friend one marches with him to the end. This we have done and will continue to do with Germany, her people and
her victorious armed forces.
On this eve of an event of import for centuries, we turn our thoughts to His Majesty, the King and Emperor, who
always has understood the thought of the country.
Lastly, we salute the new Fuehrer, the chief of great allied Germany.
Proletariat, Fascist Italy has arisen for the third time, strong, proud, compact as never before.
There is only one order. It is categorical and obligatory for every one. It already wings over and enflames hearts
from the Alps to the Indian Ocean: Conquer!
And we will conquer in order, finally, to give a new world of peace with justice to Italy, to Europe and to the
universe.
Italian people, rush to arms and show your tenacity, your courage, your valor."

11527,"This is a great game with a lot of content that you won't see in a single run.  It's a lot of fun and gives you a lot of options for how you want to play. I've played this game for years and can say no two runs will be the same. Expert mode is a great option for when you want a bit more of a challenge and has great new rewards for doing so. 
The only criticism I have for this game is pillar event/moon lord.  The pillars are tedious and boring, the enemies are annoying, with one enemy for each pillar being a major problem while the rest are just fodder. And then, after all that( and waiting for an eternity) the moon lord appears. I love his design, and the fight is reasonable on normal and expert, but the high health and defense on master mode makes the fight take and obnoxiously long time. And if you win' your prize is a one in nine chance to get the item you actually want."

11563,"I don't think this game needs a review, it's just so beloved already, but as with many people, I absolutely adore many aspects of Terraria. 

The gameplay seems deceptively simple at the start, but as you go, it opens up and before you know it you're fighting eldritch monsters in epic battles at that shape the world itself. The game's creativity seems so limitless that when compared with games of a similar ilk, they can hardly compare. I've put lots of hours into those adjacent to Terraria; Minecraft, Starbound, but there's just a boundless charm to every ounce of Terraria. The exploration is so beautiful and meaningful. Every direction you go there's something new and interesting to find. New items to craft, new bosses to fight. It really is a game that keeps on giving. 

Also if you haven't done it yet, get TModLoader and play the Calamity mod. It's amazing. It feels like a very natural extension of the already beautiful base game, but only if you've completed the base game prior."
11564,very fun. (WARNING.) do not install tmod loader before terraria steam will detect terraria in it and you will not be able to play unless you uninstall steam.
11565,good

11572,It is a lot of fun and with friends even more (when you have some to play with ). The starting is a little boring but after the wall of flesh the game will get more exciting.
11573,i liked how it is a 2d game it is a lot off fun
11574,Poot
11575,uwu
11576,"epic game
"
11577,"good game, very classy."
11578,"I thoroughly enjoyed completing this*. Most of the achievements are really easy once you get good at the game and you get most anyway just by reaching the point to kill the moon lord. 

*However, there is an exception, the last fishing achievement, it's just awful. It doesn't serve a purpose within the game itself like the other achievements, there's no skill behind it, it's just there for ""bragging rights"" to say to others ""look at me, I went above and beyond the C.O.D. and fished constantly, even though I didn't get anything worthwhile from it""."
11579,fat and uhly
11580,amazing game especially with friends.

11588,"A really good game. 
Very fun end entertaining to play, it may be overwhelming to play at first but after you play for some time the whole game becomes a lot more fun."
11589,"This game is seriously addicting, got the game a week ago and already sunk in 30 hours. My one and only gripe is that the early game is very slow and tedious so if you don't have the time to sink into it maybe hold off on playing it a bunch."
11590,mods makes game 1000 better
11591,terawr
11592,played for 7 hours yet the only thing i figoured out how to do is to die

11624,"If you ever keep scrolling, looking for games, I'm sure this one will catch your attention. Terraria is a world-wide known game, in which you can either play in ""creative mode"" (Journey) or try your skills in survival mode. You can select between Classic, Expert and Mastermode difficulty, based on the player's comforts. It's a great change of pace, because you need to constantly upgrade your gear and weapons. This may sound a bit boring, but I can assure you, it's really entertaining. I would recommend that game to every player."

11639,its pretty fun.
11640,"Best 10$ (24‚Ç∫) I have spent. The game at first looks like a soft sandbox game which, it isnt. It is an impressive game that has stunning OST, amazing bosses, so many easter eggs, events that are questionably hard but are highly rewarding. You feel like a hero after defeating the main bosses. My one and only advice to newcomers is using the official terraria wiki which helps expenentially. (You will need alot of determination if you want to 100% the game as there are very hard achievements which can take hours to complete, beware)

Overall, 96/100 game."
11641,god gam very much
11642,"good game break tree, fight boss"
11643,Quite a pog champ game not gonna lie.
11644,"I used to play the mobile version on my iPad with my family until one update completely ruined the controls. After a couple years I remembered the game and bought it on Steam and I could hardly recognise it anymore. The last time I had played Terraria, the Terra Blade was the strongest weapon in the game and suddenly there were tons of new things that had been added. Played through it, determined to get every achievement, succeeded and had an absolute blast.  Overall, absolutely amazing game with limitless possibilities for construction, combat, and all manor of other activities. By far one of the best games I've played."

11738,really kewl
11739,i got this game 4 weeks ago and its great i have 96% of the achievements and its still fun i non stop played this game for 5 ish days and i do not regret it at all its great solo and with friends
11740,yes
11741,"An amazing game with great weaponss and bosses
"
11742,I have played this game for almost 70 hours so far. best game! lots of content and thought out story.
11743,very fun
11744,good game
11745,"If you somehow haven't tried this yet but like 2d metroidvania like combat, whacky weapons, building, and exploration then this is your stop. Multiplayer is available so get together with the boy's and take on the world, then once you've finished the game download the calamity mod and marvel at how good and how much stuff there is for free!"
11746,I love this game. It have so many adventure thing to do :V
11747,Such a good game
11748,"This is one awesome 2D game I have ever played, why? Because of the progressing and building and fighting and much MORE! Overall this game is a big recommend to people who loves building cool/beautiful houses and structures or battling BIG and STRONG foes that will come over time and the Loot is awesome and worth the progressing. And this game is super fun when your friend Joins in for the Adventure and yes sadly PC and Consoles and Mobile cant Multi-play together yet, but just wait a bit longer and play the game while you wait. 9.5/10  :)"
11749,"It takes more patience than a PAYDAY heist, but it's still excellent"
11750,"Terraria  is a great game to play with friends or your self, The controls are easy to learn, the gameplay is fun and well done, its a little complicated at first but the Terraria wiki is very helpful for that, in addition with tmod loader you have quite a few things to do. I would recommend this game for players who like a challenge and don't mind grinding.  - DragonBoi"
11751,"Good game, played for a couple hours, would recommend."
11752,"It can be quite hard.  And unlike most roguelikes that DON'T save as often as they do, don't think you can ALT+F4 out of frustration."
11753,i stil dont undarstand this game
11754,very cool thank you mojang
11755,it good game
11756,"fun and good
yeet"
11757,This is the REAL DEAL
11758,"A whole lot of fun for less than half a gigabyte and a fraction of the cost of modern triple-A titles. Considering how every update is the ""last update,"" though, I cannot guarantee the validity of my former claim relative to the size of the game in, for example, five years from now. Still, purchase this game or suffer the consequences of being AFK during an invasion, except it will occur in real life and therefore have significantly more lethal results."
11759,good
11760,This game is very fun
11761,hueta
11762,yeah it's aight
11763,good game right here folks
11764,good game
11765,"For people who say this is 2d minecraft is right but not 100% right, this game has a lot more variety and has more than just it being a ""Pixel"" game"
11766,good game
11767,This is like one of the games.
11768,"its fire dawg
"
11769,swaggy
11770,"i just love this game
"
11771,Its hella good :)
11772,"VERI BIG FANI WID FREND IF NO FRENDS NO GEM FOR YOU BC DEN YOU SHOULD JUST GO OUTSIDE
"
11773,Good
11774,"I am a person who thought that I would never play this game. To be honest, I was fairly adamant at one point in my life about not wanting to try it out. One night, however, I got drunk with a buddy over voice chat and he convinced me to buy what I thought at the time was a cheapie 2D Minecraft clone. Boy, was I wrong. This game is a million times better than Minecraft. In fact, I do not know why i had even compared the two. What started as a little wood chopping and house building adventure eventually turned into a one hundred hour long duo playthrough with my buddy. I think this game actually improved our friendship. I still can't wrap my head around all of the stuff you can do in this game. In Minecraft you fight a dragon. In Terraria you fight fucking Cthulu. Must I say more?"
11775,Like minecraft except 2d and 100x the stuff
11776,"i love everything
"
11777,"Great game. I would highly recommend getting tmod loader with it, it allows modding of the game for completely free and can really make the game better."
11778,"Great game, better minecraft"
11779,"good game
"
11780,Fun
11781,decent game but all the complex systems and mechanics require you to constantly google shit which really detracts from the gameplay.
11782,"Some say this game is like minecraft.
Its not. Ok maybe a bit with the crafting but thats all. 
Unique wepons. Diverse enemies. Godly music(Calamity mod even better). Bosses are creative.
But thus game is not for casual players(beginners), it's challenging as hell.
Also there's a boob mod"
11783,yaya very cute
11784,"very cool
"
11785,The Music is gud lol
11786,nurse hot
11787,"didn't play much, not a fan"
11788,yes
11789,"This game is really fun and there is so many things to do. There are to parts of this game, there is regular. Once you kill all the bosses in that you move on to hardcore. The game progressively gets more difficult. There is a HUGE variety of weapons, armor, pets, and WAY MORE! I have spent days on this game because of how fun it is. I really recommend anybody to get this game."
11790,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11791,"game is fun and interesting.
"
11792,Absolutely love this game.
11793,"games shit doo doo
edit : games still shit doo doo"
11794,good
11795,"yes
"
11796,good
11797,its cool i am also teaching my friend how to play the game it was a funny experience
11798,just buy minecraft Terraria is not great with mod  theirs not a lot of freedom beat it once and you wont play it again i may of played it for ten hours but that was because i left it on
11799,One of the greatest video games of all time!
11800,"Minecraft
"
11801,"good game
"
11802,best game ever
11803,"Terraria is a world you wont want to leave when the game is off. You'l constantly be thinking, ""Oh, if i do ___, ___ would be easier, and if i get this weapon i can beat ___."""
11804,Great game
11805,Probably my most played game that I've only ever gotten half way through
11806,"Really fun, it can run onm my poto of a cumputer so yaya"
11807,Very fun for multyplayer
11808,good
11809,*there is so much to do.*
11810,"very confusing at first, as you progress and get better at the game, you will start to learn about the game. I recommend watching videos, and exploring, as that is key to learning."
11811,This game is wonderful its got lots of challenges and bosses to fight and you can put it on other difficulties too  in my perspective this is my favorite game and when I try to find games like it I cant because terraria is on a whole other level of fun. When I first got it I couldn't put the game down so if your looking for a challenge I  reccomend trying this game.
11812,terraria good game truly insane
11813,I did a school project on this game.
11814,is good
11815,very good
11816,amazing game i have played it for years and it is full of things to do
11817,"This game is the worst. the graphics crap, the building crap.  a 2d open world is a bad idea.it is inpossible to understand. I did not enjoy one hour i want my mony back."
11818,GUD SDMG
11819,good
11820,do not play i hate fxlu
11821,"Been playing this game for years, never ending, time consuming fun,"
11822,YES
11823,yes
11824,fun
11825,"I have played this game for years. I have probably put over 1000 hours into it considering how much I played on my tablet and ipod. It's only $15 (or $10? idk) It is 100% worth your money.  It is a huge game and there is a lot to do. If you like survival games with difficult bosses, then this is the game for you!!"
11826,haha drill go brrrr
11827,very good game.

11836,fun
11837,2d
11838,"My girlfriend claimed that Terraria wasn't enjoyable, so I found a new one."
11839,yes just play it
11840,I am convinced that the mobs in this game are not AI's and are in fact real beings because every time I try to do something or jump over them they predict my movement and curb-stomp me into the ground and then the cycle of death begins. Everything wants to kill you. Would recommend if you like to die twenty seven times in a row whilst trying to retrieve your items. Very fun
11841,"Godlike game,if your friend played for very long and your a noobie at your new world he will carry you and make you doom slayer on your own world. If you have money totally buy it."
11842,fun game
11843,"lone get this and jai play it more
"
11844,"My friends babysit me.

On a serious note, I thought this game was wack and past it's prime, all the mysterious blocks and shit I still have to collect and learn, the bosses I know nothing that's what I like about a game, it keeps me learning, adapting, I love this game already but it pisses me off xd.

Overall
9.3/10

I'm gonna give this a more depth review after I'm finished."
11845,"Great game, I enjoy it a lot. Worth it to purchase"
11846,Always been a fan. Started playing on my phone then Xbox and now I'm on PC :). It's only been getting better to be honest. Definitely recommend for new and returning players that might of fallen out.
11847,cool game
11848,"""Yes babe, the terraria crocs stay on during sex""
Anyway, this is probably the greatest game i've always played, great looks, amazing and creative boss fights
For a first timer on this game i would say look up a tutorial and check the wiki if your not sure how to craft something
the difficulty changes are amazing and nothing is too drastic except ftw,
NEVER PLAY FOR THE WORTHY. enough said."
11849,Cannot rewrite dogshit controls. Cash grab shit game
11850,good
11851,IT IS SO GOOD
11852,"Fuck all of you guys for making me play this game. I fucking hate this game.



First there's a boss that fucking vores you called The King Slime which looks vaguely like the slime king from dragon quest.
Second it's literally paper minecraft from the hit website called Scratch.
They completely copied off Cuphead and Dark Souls
You know what? Fuck this game.

11863,It's fun and I like it
11864,"Great game. Lots of variety and magic that was missing in minecraft.
"
11865,"very fun i used to play this on mobile/ps4  for years, i came back to it on PC and its still as fun as it was back then"
11866,Starts out really annoying but once you get a hang of things it's actually pretty fun
11867,u can sex the furry girl
11868, yeah
11869,ee
11870,"i used to play this game on my brothers pc, he pirated it but i loved the game so much i couldnt be brought to pirate it so i just bought it, i also bought one for him"
11871,Among the finest of games.
11872,Money
11873,I hate this game just because I am not good at playing this and instead of taking action against my lack of skill I am going to blame this game.
11874,Amazing very fun once you get into it
11875,"An amazing 2D adventure, survival game including magic and fantasy. Being honest the instructions aren't terribly clear for this game and sometimes you might get stuck on what to do so I recommend you watch some Youtube videos to get to grips with the game because there is a lot to learn! But I would put in the effort because it was one of my favourite games as a young child and still is to this day. This game is a must-play."
11876,The best in this genre
11877,"Its okay i guess
"
11878,bruh
11879,good game would recommend
11880,nice
11881,i keep forgetting my lava charm and by default belly flop into hell's hot tub and get baked alive
11882,cool game
11883,"Every 6 or so months you're just bound to return to the game, endless cycle of inescapable torment. Would recommend"
11884," Plenty of content, very fun exploration, combat, crafting, progression."
11885,/
11886,best game on steam ngl
11887,best sequel to minecraft
11888,This game is so much fun for me and my friend
11889,"i spent some time on the game. it is good  to come back every 4 months and play til the end.

11913,"An absolutely wonderful game with an incredibly satisfying gameplay loop.

The bosses are all interesting, the customization endless, the weapons diverse and fun, and the grind feels great.

There is so much content here that you will be kept busy nearly forever, and I would wholeheartedly recommend buying this game both on and off sale as you will easily get your money's worth.

If you haven't tried this masterpiece do so ASAP, you will not regret it.

11962,"Just writing this cause I noticed I never wrote a review for this even though a lot of people have probably already played this game and know how great it is. If you have not yet played Terraria you 100% should, just to try it out at least. One of the greatest games ever made with so many possibilities on what to do and an insanely amazing amount of replay value, not to mention the almost insurmountable amount of items that this game throws at you is great. Might be a bit overwhelming at first, but once you get the hang of it you'll find yourself struggling to put it down. This is coming from a person who at one point would get bored of the game once getting to a certain point in the game, but trust me, now that I've actually finished the game I can proudly say it's one of the best games i've probably ever played. Would Recommend, thank you for coming to my ted talk"

11966,"There is no reason for you not to get this game. Its such an amazing game I struggle to find words to describe it. I may not have the most hours recorded on base terraria itself but I have found great pleasure playing both modded and mobile. The wiki that was created is also super helpful and there are plenty of guides to help you through your journey.

Pros:
- Very fun single player
- Easy to play with friends
- A lot of bosses and a lot of progression
- Great community
- More that I can list off

Cons:
- I have heard from friends that they don't enjoy staring at the wiki
- (for me at least) not the best replayablity but the free ""tmod loader"" on steam fixes that

This is also nothing like minecraft. Both games a equally great but don't have much to compare.

12030,"223 hours is just my playtime on steam. If I were to combine the hours I have spent on this game from all platforms I'd easily have over 1000+ hours. Terraria is one of the best games on the market and the fact it's still receiving constant ""final"" updates proves the dev team loves it as well."
12031,Played this game since I was a child. Will always be a classic and never fails to be fun with several ways to play the game and the addition of expert mode and master mode.
12032,"You can tell Re-Logic really cares about their game.
Great Game
10/10
would die to slime again"
12033,"BUY THIS! 
This is better than almost any other game ive ever played. and ive put more hours into it than any other game i have on my account (as of 7/21/2022) its not just minecraft but 2D, its so much bigger. there's so much to do, so many boss fights to win, so much items to make, so many places to find (and raid) you can make items, make houses for NPCs, fight monsters, try out mods (SO MANY MODS) play around with items, make minigames, and put those minigames out on the workshop. you can make golf maps, you can make PVP maps, parkour maps, adventure maps, using wires and a bunch of creativity, you can make entire games and stories in here. and the amount of mods this game has is just comical. you just never run out of fun things to do. and it runs well on low end hardware, so long as you mess with graphics settings a little bit.
and theres multiplayer. and it makes the game even more enjoyable. but im not gonna get into that, because i havent played it. 

10/10 game. while minecraft is making updates designed to ruin the playerbase, re-logic is making updates to keep the community hyped up, and happy. and they do it perfectly. 
oh yeah, and one more thing, the soundtrack is really good. and its worth buying it for 5 bucks just to support whoever made it."
12034,Good
12035,Great Game
12036,Good game for low price with much content.

12040,Awesome Game!!! made me cum a lil bit when i got a rare drop
12041,"Terraria is hard if you're new, but it's a good adventure to have. Figuring out how to beat bosses and get better gear (with slight bit of help from the wiki) and talking to the guide is pretty much all you need to progress. It gets rough though when you enter hard mode as enemies began to shred through you and began to pose a challenge once again. The game's progression scales in difficulty is alright - not the best as from pre-hardmode to hardmode enemies just seem to do x5 damage, but that's what Terraria is about. Very good game and has replayability as you can get additional gear from the alternate crimson/corruption biomes in different worlds as well as difficulty (normal, expert and master)."
12042,"More than anything, I feel like Terraria is a game crafted with love. The more you play it, the more you can feel the love the creators have put into every little facet of the game. What else can be said about this wonderful game that hasn't already been said? The gameplay is exquisite, the soundtrack is one banger after another, and the progression is so juicy that after you take one bite, you can't stop yourself. If you consider yourself a person who enjoys video games, you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try Terraria. And at the price it's selling for, it's a damn steal."
12043,It's a good
12044,It's OK.
12045,This game is very fun although people may think it's bad because its 2d it being 2d is one of the best parts about the game.
12046,pixel game go brr

12056,"This game is really nice. Its great for building and exploring. But compared to what I see on youtube I have no idea what to do or even how to do it. Got 5k of copper, lead, tungsten, platinum and arount 500 demonite. But I dont know what to do, there's no list. Some players said go to dungeon, I died instantly lost 150 gold. The game is really good when it comes to items, exploring, randomization, building... but how the hell do I get all the cool stuff and where do I begin? Some kind of guidance or quest or something would be necessary, atleast for me. 

Still a really great game consider the price."

12081,is don is good
12082,real
12083,"Amazing game. People who say its 2D Minecraft are stupid since it is so different from Minecraft in every way and in my opinion, it's better than Minecraft. More, better and harder bossfights, cool and interesting characters and a whole mountains worth of different and unique weapons to choose from as well as different classes to play from and armor and accessories and I could just go on and on."
12084,This game is wonderful. Many unique bosses etc. Play with friends for it to be more fun and enjoyable.
12085,GOOD
12086,boss
12087,"Good thing I didn't get this game on sale.
I would've been guilty buying it if it were the case."

12090,"Wonderful game with an endless amount of depth and content. There will always be something new to do, unless you dump over 600 hours into this game. I am not exaggerating."
12091,Yah Yeet
12092,
12093,Its Alright.
12094,"My favorite part was finally crafting the Zenith and, after 900 hours, seeing every enemy, event, and boss squashed like a bug under the weight of 19.8k DPS. Revenge is as sweet as this game is fun."
12095,W game
12096,"Fun, very fun game"
12097,"To Be Honest, I Couldn't Even Play 10 Hours Of This Game. I Can't Even Begin To Describe How Horrific This Video Game Is. I Downloaded This Game Due To A Recommendation From My Friend, Telling Me This Was Going To Be The Most Fun I Will Ever Have, But Clearly He Was Wrong. In The First Hour I Played This Game, I Could Tell This Was Not Going To Satisfy Me. I Want To Commit Devious Acts To Re-Logic. 0.5/10, Highly Do Not Recommend."
12098,very good very nice
12099,"Amazing value, you can easily get 100's of hours of entertainment and the ModLoader you can get for terraria makes it even better, modding this game is unbelievably simple, also funni flying tortoise in jungle makes hardmode experience 10/10"
12100,"This game needs to be fixed, PLEASE. I cant play Tmod nor Terraria bc there's this error that keeps occuring and I've tried everything to fix it, I've tried restarting my pc, I've also tried uninstalling Tmod and i did, but when i reinstalled it, it still didn't work, also when i tried uninstalling Terraria itself, it didn't even work and i also cant go into the local files. please help me with this"
12101,"This game is by far the best dopamine simulator I've ever played. There's something about the slaughter and get-slaughtered pacing that makes every single bit of progress (at least in the game's harder expert/master modes) feel like a breakthrough. The game sucks you in and subjects you to an overwhelming chemical symphony of PURE neural activity. It, so far, has stolen over 600 hours of my life that I will never miss.

The devs are great

If you haven't bought this game yet, you're living your life wrong."
12102,yes
12103,"i am additced to this game in a bad way,this is a plea for help"
12104,This game could use more sex!!! its alright though.
12105,yeah.
12106,"When one of my friends at school told me to play Terraria with him, I thought that this was just going to be 2D minecraft with extra steps

After 173 hours and a lot of good memories, it is still 2D minecraft with extra steps

Would recommend to anyone that lost their minecraft hardcore world and is now grieving

But other than the stupid kid, this game is worth more than it costs. Oh and one other thing, the amount of times i killed the annoying kid is 149 times."

There is no tutorial, so maybe look up one if you are playing it for the first time. One of my favorite games."

12162,"I am a 4,500 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

If you want something that has the most bang for your Buck, Terraria is it.
If you want a way to build in cool and unique ways, Terraria is it.
If you want Combat that is Loose, yet still somehow rigid, Terraria is it.
If you want to play one of the best games Ever made, Terraria is it.
$10 may be a bit much, but I promise that this is worth more than the most recent TrippleA game produced by Company:tm: 
If you want a good time, Terraria is it."
12197,I think that this game is amazing because not only is it over 20 hours of playtime without mods if you have pc thats not as bad as mine theres mods pvp and more. So overall this game is just great to play by yourself or with friends it runs well on mac and windows and is super fun.

12292,"Incredible game. The experience of growing with your world makes it feel like the game breathes like it's alive. Thousands of items to explore, (extremely) rewarding gameplay and action packed brutal ultra-violence for the mildly deranged.
This game has so many different play styles, not to mention the possibilities with Tmod Loader, the game's offical mod workshop.
Worth the buy, 9.5/10"

12352,one of the best games out there.

10/10
Would recommend
Would and have played again again in a heartbeat"
12360,Terraria on pc was GENIUS I tell you this game has it all... I know there not the same game bt if you're playing Minecraft and are looking for something new trust me when I say Terraria is the game you've been searching for.
12361,I have basically played this game throughout my entire childhood. The fighting enemies and trying to find resources to craft armor and weapons is very engaging. The music also clearly had some effort put into it.

12370,really good game
12371,"Terraria is easily one of the greatest most well-crafted games I have ever played. The amount of hours you can spend in this game is almost endless, especially if you have some friends to help you. The devs are still adding new content all of the time (despite them ""calling it quits"" with Journey's end) and it's clear how deeply passionate they are about it. For $10 there is absolutely no reason not to buy this game"
12372,yes
12373,modded better but it good
12374,i liked it
12375,good playing with friends
12376,ytuyiuoi

12378,I dont have a joke for this one.
12379,After almost 1000 hours played in this game I still find ways to distract myself enough that I don't actually beat it. Overall great game and I hope they continue to update it.
12380,the
12381,"I'm about to get a refund on this piece of garbage. In order to get a refund you need less than 2 hours, so I won't do anymore. I've played for about an hour and it's so boring.  The player maneuverability is extremely obnoxious. Digging takes way too long. I'm not really interested in grinding through painful controls and braindead mobs for another 4 hours just to get to the fun part."
12382,"A very fun game to play both alone and with friends. You create a world and a character to explore, defeat bosses aswell as get attached to random little NPCs or summons. If you like fantasy, D&D, minecraft, stardew valley, i'd say this is a game you'd like. You can play calm, or you can play for a more thrilling experience."
12383,its good
12384,the great game becomes greater with mods and friends.
12385,Have been playing for a very long time and never gets old. There are so many different elements to the game that there is always something to do. This and minecraft are what a lot of my childhood were built on so much love to this game. 10/10
12386,Cool game tbh

12400,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you‚Äôre watching this tape, I‚Äôm probably dead‚Äì murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my fiftieth birthday, Hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was astounded. I‚ÄìI always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time‚Äìsomething he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn‚Äôt want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head and, Hank had a partner named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn‚Äôt know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, of which Fring flatly refused to give it, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh, I guess‚Ä¶ I guess you call it a hit on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me. And he gave me no option in that. I have often contemplated suicide, but I‚Äôm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the reigns to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time to keep me in line, he took my children from me, for three months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done. Why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. And I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me. Or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."
12401,its fun lol

12419,its very fun gvme
12420,BeSt Gane ive evEr PlEYed
12421,"Countless hours of content, all of which is enjoyable and feels rewarding."
12422,"Honestly one of the best Games available on steam, the gameplay is really a treat to experience and given the vast amount of options to choose from and places to explore, the game can take a while to complete given the choice that you decided to take your time with discovering everything, this game even expands upon this with the free tmod download, allowing for even more enemies, bosses, and gameplay mechanics to discover. With a game with no instructions progression may get confusing and stalled at times but even the community is amazing at explaining vivid guides through the Terraria wiki's allowing no one to get stuck permanently. All in All a 10/10 would spend hours more on this game."
12423,its fun
12424,"I have been playing Terraria since late 2011 and I have watched the game grow, and this may be my nostalgia talking but, I believe that it is one of the best games out there."

12464,Great game If you like grindy rpgs then this is for you
12465,"Well I primary play on my switch, so this is not my main , I have defeated the game many times, and I have found that, if you are into lowkey fighter games, or roleplaying games, or building games this is for you, the hours to put into it is not to much 100hrs {for me at least}  you will have good gear and a fair base, but the one problem is if you get into this game a lot, like me, you will finish in a month, and finish it so many times that you have all the items and just are bored. so to recap its a great game and after 200hrs ish of gameplay I still find it fun but not ""addicting"" as it was, so more content would be great, but I guess thats why we have mods . -Preston J mitchell          { I would ,and have highly recomended this game to many. }"
12466,VERY fun
12467,very fun
12468,"Fun exploration, and the feeling of progression is great in this game."

12474,95% of the game is a ton of fun especially w/ friends. But at that last 5% you wonder what to do and since its 2d there isn't that much to build.
12475,Great game to play with friends but kinda boring when playing by yourself. I would suggest getting tmodloader and get some mods for it

12496,"Quick trash is a stupid feature and the fact you can't disable it is an even stupider design choice.
There are a lot of people who hate this feature and probably an even bigger amount that don't want it either but don't talk about it.
In a lot of games CTRL and clicking is used for inventory management but none of them use it for trashing.
Dumb feature, counter intuitive, for the love of god make an update to disable this literal trash feature not just to switch the button around for it."
12497,One of the games ever made

12505,"a very normal survival RPG without any disturbing stuff. also just dont believe the devs anytime they say its the end,it probably means theres gonna be an update after a month or so"
12506,Extremely fun game with infinite possibilities on what to do.
12507,IT FUN
12508,"So basically, me, my friend, and his dad were chilling on the beaches in Los Angeles when his dad told us that he had bought a new speedboat. So we went down to the marina and saw this long, red, slick looking speedboat. I then looked over to see his dad twirling the keys in his finger and then he stepped into the boat. Me and my friend both hopped into the boat and we all left the marina. His dad then told us both, ""Picked 'er up for about $65 000, and she can go REAL fast."" We both put a large grin on our faces along with a pair of life jackets. My friends dad then sat us down and then cranked the throttle all the way, making the boat almost fly across the water. We were going around 150 km/h at max. While me and my friend were enjoying the crystal beaches of LA, his dad reached for his sunglasses, and while he was digging around for his glasses he didn't notice a large boulder in front of the boat that we were speeding right towards. Luckily, me and my friend reacted quickly, we grabbed each other and then jumped off of the boat. We then watched in horror as my friends dad violently combusted along with his boat when he flew into the rock. I swam away unscathed but my friend had minor injuries around his foot and leg. We swam to shore where a local LA rat called emergency services, and we were taken home. That is the story of how my friends dad died in a high speed boating accident. 

Oh, yea Terraria is a really cool game and I, like, TOTALLY recommend it."

12518,Very fun... worth your money.
12519,"One of my favorite games. It can get frustrating at times but everything feels rewarding. It can take you up to 60 hours to beat Moon Lord in your first playthrough, and that means the game has lots of content. If you combine the vanilla game with a mod like Calamity in tModLoader you get a game over 100 hours, a lot of hours for a 15 dollar game. The music is good, the pixel art beautiful that can get better with the Lights and Shadows mod.

12529,very good action adventure game

12531,Yes
12532,"Starting with nothing but a pickaxe, axe, small sword and no armour, you have to survive the first night (zombie attack), gather ores and other materials to craft better armour (after building your workstations so you can craft), better weapons, better tools, and even potions and food using alchemy and cooking, so that you can go to more dangerous places to gather better ores and better materials to craft better armour, weapons and tools, to repeat the cycle until you're able to defeat the early game bosses (fairly non-linear, although there is a door boss gating you from the other 70% of the game).

These bosses will drop loot and materials that will help you upgrade everything to the next level, so you're able to go to more difficult areas to get better... you get the idea.

While the bosses are a nice challenge, there are also armies that will come to invade. They'll attack your village from the east or west and it's down to you to single handedly massacre them all for daring to attack, earning some coin and drops in the process.

Early on you can decide on your playstyle/class, in the way that you can use the standard sword and play as a melee character, or if you'd prefer, opt for bows and arrows, guns, flails, spells, summons, turrets, yoyos (surprisingly good considering they're yoyos), or all the weapons at once and switch it up mid combat. The armour you aim to craft and equip will be effected by the way you want to play. Later armours have more stats than just defence, so you won't want to be aiming for that +20% melee damage armour if you're set on being a gunner.

But the grind isn't the goal of the game. Doing whatever you want is. After the initial gearing up session so the average overworld slime isn't a challenge to you, you're fairly free to build your dream castle/haunted mansion/undersea base/bat cave or play around making pixel art (check the internet for the incredible things people have built).

You can build a nice village for your NPCs (they'll come move in once you've met certain criteria) or trap them inside square rooms with no way out, or just straight up murder them in a lava pit if you feel like it. Some of them even drop vanity items.

Work on getting your wings so you can fly, or a flying mount to zip around even easier. Get the cutest minion to follow you around and customise your mine cart so you zoom through the underground on a fish-mobile. Explore the various underground biomes, as well as the equally dangerous overground ones. Rescue the mechanic so you can add wiring to your village, or the goblin tinkerer so you can upgrade your accessories.

Finally, the entire game is multiplayer, so kill those bosses, dig up those ores, build those fancy houses and jam to the addictive soundtrack with your friends (or kill them, there's also a PvP mode).

The list of what you can do in this game is fairly endless, but if it's any example, I didn't play for over 1,200 hours just to kill the same bosses again and again.

If you're still unconvinced, check out a few Let's Plays on YouTube. That usually helps me make the decision about whether or not to buy a game.

12534,Brilliant game me and my brother play it all the time
12535,"Terraria is a video game, it was coded by a comoany using a platform and can truly be considered one of the games ever made."
12536,good game buy it tbh
12537,very pog
12538,"I recommend it, I guess..."
12539,The bosses of this game are really nice in design and attacks the armour and weapons also had nice designs the zenith is a nice endgame weapon with it being really fast and powerful the highest amount of damage i have seen it do is 400 able to one shot of players

12553,its a great game really good graphics and its really good to play with friends
12554,worst game ive ever played in my entire life.  dont buy this game.
12555,good. think i finished playing it though
12556,Minecraft But in 2D
12557,is gooooood
12558,"Such a blast, usually get lost in building for hours when I play. solid 9/10"
12559,"So, Terraria is, in my opinion, not that good, and while I somewhat like it, it just feels like the same gameplay loop, and like other games, I can't get myself to play it a second time. I played with friends and really didn't do that much because 1: They did not help me figure out how to play the game. And 2: The game (in my opinion) is just too complicated, having to do all these verrrrry specific things to activate bossfights, etc. I know mods exist, but I could honestly care less. I like the idea, just too complicated in certain areas and a boring gameplay loop of grind, kill, grind, kill."
12560,"Somebody say games is temporary when you grow old you will no longer need it but Terraria is eternity just like whey protein.
Dont forget to go outside and do some workout. Stay strong my Chad comrade friends."
12561,pretty good i would recommend this to new gamers

12566,best game
12567,i always wanted terraria pc as a kid. i never realize that i take this game for granted. thanks terraria
12568,fun
12569,"This is my message to my master
This is a fight you cannot win
I think that past your great disasters
Their victory stirs below your skin"
12570,"this game is amazing, it has lots of bosses, interesting weapons, and awesome progression. You can also play different classes which makes it so you can have lots of fun playing the game through multiple times!"
12571,Terraria>Minecraft
12572,"I have spent more time than I'd like to admit playing Terraria, I originally played it on my 3DS years ago and poured hours into it nonstop. Unfortunately due to the buggy nature of the 3DS my original save file got corrupted but that didn't stop me from loving this game.

Content: The game has thousands of items to collect and over a dozen bosses to fight. On your first play through you'll most definitely need to check the wiki just due to the sheer amount of content in this game. It's honestly mind blowing and can seem overwhelming, but that only makes it more fulfilling when you start to understand the mechanics of the and get better at them. 9/10

Progression: I can't think of any other game that makes you feel this badass, you go from a sad scrawny boy to a UFO-riding, zenith-wielding, dolphin-shooting Chad. There is nothing more rewarding than killing the boss you've been stuck on for hours and reaping the rewards of its demise. 10/10

Visuals: The visuals are nothing groundbreaking in the world of gaming but goddamn this game looks nice. The sprites and animations of enemies are consistently good. The backgrounds look fantastic. I have seen some crazy cool shit that people have made in this game, despite the game being 2-D it never seems confined by this and instead thrives on it. 9/10

Soundtrack: Genuinely my favourite OST in a video game ever. Maybe it's nostalgia but this shit goes hard. The only thing holding me back from smashing my monitor after dying to a giant wasp for the tenth time is the funky beats playing in the underground jungle. The boss fight music is just fantastic and gets me in the mood to go sicko mode on those fuckers every time. Its just all around iconic and has very few weak points. 10/10

Gameplay: The overall Terraria experience is great but isn't super friendly to new players. But fear not, there are many guides to follow for the early game and the Terraria Wiki will have all the answers you need. A lot of elements of the game can be tailored to your personal preferences. For example, grinding, you can go into the game completely blind and use whatever items the game throws at you, or you can spend hours grinding to get rare items like the Rod of Discord. You can also go for a completionist run and get every achievement in the game, fair warning the fishing quests are hell. But in general the gameplay is rewarding, fun and keeps me coming back time and time again. 10/10

Replayability: Terraria is one of the most replayable games I have ever played. This is due to a number of factors. The amount of content in the game ensures that two of your playthroughs will never be the exact same, you're always going to acquire different gear to progress the game and it's always fun to experiment with different combinations. On that topic there are different dedicated classes you can play as in Terraria, such as melee, ranged, magic and summoning. All of them are unique and challenging in their own right and are all worth checking out at least once. You can also just say fuck it and mash all the classes into an OP abomination and it will still be fun. There are also a few different difficulties to play in, classic, expert, master and journey. From classic through master the difficulty expectantly gets harder, but there are also unique items that are only obtainable in their respective difficulties. Journey mode is the most interesting because it gives more freedom and turns the game into more of a sandbox, the best parallel I could give is Minecraft's creative mode. But its mostly the satisfying gameplay that always makes me excited to start up a new playthrough. 11/10

Community: In my experience the Terraria community is mostly filled with creative nice people. And the modding community for this game is also thriving and the mods can add a lot to your experience with Terraria. 9/10

To conclude this review, I can't express to you how outstanding this game is and the impact its had on my life.
If your on the fence about buying this game, just go for it, for the $11 that you spend on it, it is so unbelievably worth it

I love this game 10/10"
12573,it good
12574,can have a lizard that flies as a pet
12575,gud game
12576,The Dryad makes me real hard
12577,great game
12578,"This is a classic, had it on console and decided to come back and buy it on here.
You'll keep discovering new stuff for a long time, and there's a lot of ways to get around, build stuff, fight, and progress. I like that you get a lot of freedom deciding how big you want your world and how difficult and risky you want your gameplay to be."
12579,this game is ight at best
12580,Yeah it's pretty cool
12581,its kinda fun
12582,"Literally identical to Minecraft in every single way.

Jk, this game is a genuine timeless masterpiece that everyone needs to play. You can feel every ounce of dedication and passion poured into Terraria within the steep amount of content that the developers have provided for us over all these years. At 10$, Terraria is the best bang for your buck you can get in gaming. The best tips I can provide for any new players are, pull up the wiki, and talk to the ""Guide"" NPC that spawns with you. You NEED the wiki for this game. All in all though, if you for some reason have not yet experienced this game, do yourself a favor and try it. Absolute classic, 11/10.

Actually no, 2/10 until Re-Logic increase drop rate for the Obsidian Rose"
12583,its ight

12619,meh
12620,Eh Do you like grinding and have no life then you have found the right game where you spend all of your hours holed up in a cave mining for resources for the occasional boss battle if not killing mobs
12621,"Its a great game. Just make sure to get it for PC if possible since its more expensive on other devices (except mobile but mobile is quite honestly incredibly hard to play). Great game though might be one of the best I have ever played, must have for anybody who likes sandbox/adventure/action games."
12622,very fun slightly unrelaxing gameplay
12623,Better Minecraft
12624,"Can't get fart jar in the early game
I am very upset
my reaction when I don't have fart jar: üò°ü§¨"
12625,"pretty good, only one problem. this game is harder to mod on apple devices (mac), for some odd reason. the game will only show super low quality mods that ttake little space, and not bigger mods like calamitty with tmod"
12626,"This games super addictive and to my understanding its still supported and updated 8 years after its release so if you like minecraft this is, in some ways, maybe even better than that such as having actual classes you can gear up to. Online works excellently so its amazing with friends. Great game, do own."

12637,the game is one of the best games i played
12638,i like everything about it.
12639,"Almost as if Minecraft became a 2D 16-bit pixil game with chock full of references to other popular video games and homages to pop culture. The crafting is extensive and is far from logical when crafting items, as is the item names and the descriptions for items. This game is obvious that it doesn't take itself too seriously and is surprisingly very addictive. You can wear costumes, equip funky gear to do awesome and at time odd maneuvers and skills, fight slimes, mimics, and lovecraftian monsters. Do some fishing in-between and hopefully not get caught during a Blood Moon, or make it back in time to fight off the Goblin Army or an Airship pirate invasion. With luck, maybe a lovely patch of land will land will converted into Terraria's version of Whimseyshire from Diablo III and you'll get to play with pink unicorns who'd love to trample your corpse.

The benefits of this game - unlike most others if not all others games - is that when you do exhaust all you can do on your map, you can pack your bags and hop onto a new map for a new adventure with all your loot you've earned. The developers made sure that they kept the ""fun"" aspect of this game and it can be as hard or as easy as you make it, you don't have to loose anything if you want to. 







NOTE: This is my opinion and thoughts of the game and not an overall view of the game for general audiences. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research. This notice should not be necessary, but is included due to previous inflammatory commentary on reviews from previous games due to people being ""butt-hurt"" that I said either something bad about the game, disagreed with it being good, disagreed with it being bad, or using ""wording or descriptions"" one doesn't agree with."

12699,it just be good
12700,very fun and satisfying game
12701,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
12702,"0.0178253119 is the number of dollars I have spent per hour of this game (so far)
Just buy it lol"
12703,"Rookie hours as of creating this review, most of my hours for Terraria have been sunk in using the mobile version. That being said, the PC version is the definitive way to enjoy the full experience. The game only gets boring if you allow it to, as there's multiple different classes, paths for progression and thousands of options for building as well to accommodate for the person who just prefers to build pretty buildings. If you like survival, platforming adventure whilst also enjoying the metroidvania-esk progression ladder, you'll absolutely love Terraria"
12704,good
12705,guuuf
12706,every months or two I play this game a ton and then forget about it.
12707,"its a must have

12731,CANT STOP PLAYING XDDDDDD
12732,literally the best game ever
12733,"I've played almost a hundred hours and have yet to defeat the empress of light. 

Terraria is a massive game that's relaxing yet chaotic, easy to have fun, but hard not to lose mental. There's building, fishing, fighting, making a town, fighting the world from killing itself, a million items, and most of all, developers that keep on updating.

When I first picked up this game, I really thought it was a nice pixel building simulator and boy was I wrong. I spent more time preparing for the moon lord than I spent prepping for my ACT tests, I've spent more hours waiting for one gosh damn truffle worm than I've spent studying in my entire life (I've got more hours on TModLoader), and I've died to the eye of cthulu more times that I'll admit to anyone.

Alongside building your township and mining for shiny ore, you've got a nice little boss progression that pushes you through the game only at a pace you're comfortable with. There's a million different weapons so you can shoot, slash, cast, and yo-yo whatever fierce thing rolls up to your doorstep. There's more biomes in Terraria than I have black shirts in my wardrobe (I've got a lot, black's my color man.) 

This open world adventure game is the gift that keeps on giving and there's another update coming out soon as well. Thanks for 10 years of fun Re-Logic, and I hope we get another 10 more."
12734,"Awesome game! Definitely worth the money. Really, really, really hard though. I'm not a great gamer, but this is one of the harder games i have played, especially after entering hard-mode. So much content, so many bosses of varying difficulties, and journey mode is perfect for less experienced players. Would definitely recommend."
12735,"This game is a masterpiece in nearly every facet. I have sunk such an ungodly amount of time into this game modded or vanilla that i probably should seek help but this game is much cheaper than therapy. In terms of ""Your playtime isn't that high"", that would be courtesy of me owning terraria on every console except samsung smart fridge (primarily due to availability)."
12736,cool gae
12737,This game is amazing
12738,The best game I've ever played. Nothing left to say.

12745,"Only way to get 3 wifes and a kid is to play this game with 4 friends (preferably, everyone in your world doesn't know how to play)

12753,good game
12754,"highly recommend, must try with mods"
12755,best game ever
12756,"This game has a lot of fun bosses and a lot of replayability thanks to the 2 types of dificultys: 1 (softcore, mediumcore and hardcore) 2: (journey, classic, expert and master) and has a lot of content that you can do on the side wich is a lot of fun an example of that being the old one's army event or the martian madness wich also offer a lot of cool and fun weapons to use in further game progression. In my opinion I would strongly recommend this game since it is very cheap and can give you several 100 hours of game time, and if you finished vanilla terraria many times you can even use sertain software to expand your experience with modifications of wich there are many good ones out there. In summary this game is very much worth it for its low price and has a lot of replayability and can be enjoyed for a long time."

12763,"While I can certainly see why this is fun for some, this game just seems like a chore. It's much more of a grindfest in the late-game, and I personally don't think a survival game works in 2D. And while the music is good at first, it quickly becomes incredibly repetitive to the point where I had to turn it off entirely. Overall a game that's very confusing to get into, and that's certainly not for me."
12764,If you have not played this game you make me sad.
12765,anyone who calls this 2D Minecraft should onyx blast themselves

It is such a great game to play with friends, it combines so many aspects of tons of games I love and brings so much uniqueness to the table. Terraria is a top 5 game of all time for me no doubt."

12866,Great game. Had so much fun with friends. Lots of content even just the vanila.
12867,"The legendary 2d minecraft
It's a sandbox game, simple at its core. What results attractive to this game is the ""do whatever that you want"" thing.
You'll have to survive and all that, defeating some bosses to progress and all that stuff in a survival rpg style. tho if you aren't into that and want to make some cool looking structures. the game offers some easy ways to make your 2dimensional house more pretty, literally, creative mode (kinda), easy mode, and more... but, if you don't want to make a happily ever after house, you can fight to death this badass bosses, find a pyramid, take adventure on some lovecraft's creations (or at least a part of them).
In conclusion:
it's a sandbox game. You can do whatever you like and if you get used to it, you'll find it kinda chill.
100% recommendable + if you have friends."
12868,Gaming 10/10
12869,yes
12870,"One of the best games out there, hands down. 
Playing alone? The perfect mix of length, things to do, and pacing.
With friends? it can be a clusterfuck of enjoyment, with what can feel like even more of a challenge than single player.
The game is one that by itself is fan-fucking-tastic, but with mods? it only gets better.
For 10 bucks, this is easily one of the best ""bang for your buck"" games."
12871,Great game 10/10!
12872,goof
12873,"This game is great, the only problem i have is I think the way ore spawns is bad. You'll either have great luck and find giant veins on your first mining trip or it'll take you hours to just make a set of armor. Multiplayer is fantasist, you don't need to fork over money or have a degree in computer science to play with your friends unlike minecraft. Your first playthrough of this game will easily be over 100 hours. TLRD, use daedalus stormbow ASAP to dominate"
12874,One of the best sandbox games
12875,2D block game.
12876,cool
12877,Great friggen game! 10/10 will boss rush again!
12878,"I feel like writing a review for Terraria is now pointless. It seems like everyone who ever would play it already has/does. But, if by some chance, you have never played it, and you're reading this, do yourself a favor. Go play Terraria.

This game has been out since 2011, and it still holds up, and will do so for years and years to come. I go through periods of time where I don't play, but I ALWAYS come back to it and never get sick of it. It's like literally discovering a new world with every new game. I learn new things about it even now, over a decade later. AND if you don't delete your characters and worlds, you can always pick up right where you left off or start a new world as the same character.

The graphics are so pleasing to the eye, the music is awesome, and while the game overall can feel rather difficult at times, learning HOW to play is actually quite simple. A lot of people call Terraria ""2D Minecraft"" because you can... mine. And of course, craft. But they are 2 separate games with their own pros and cons and everyone is going to have a preference. Mine is, and always will be, Terraria. It is more complex, and while you can argue that it's not necessarily a ""story"" you definitely progress in a way that you do not in Minecraft. Collecting all the NPCs to move into your town is a great example of this, as well as the many boss fights and goblin invasions that mostly occur randomly. I also really love all the little Easter eggs and references.

Seriously, if you haven't played it yet, go play it.

"
12879,very fun with friends
12880,This game is awesome! The bosses are great and the NPCs are super cool!
12881,Many compare it to Minecraft but it's honestly so much better.

Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

I also really like the visuals, music and principally the progression, it's slow but there's so many items!
It's an addicting game that you can't stop playing because it's so good...
I'ts not a perfect game but I adore it and recomend you buying.
"
12958,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

I recommend you diffidently try it out. Although it has some complicated crafting with some help of you tube or expert friends of terraria. Then it would be easier the bosses are so fun to fight and the final boss the moon lord was a challenging fight but fun.

13004,"Terraria is one of those games that some people just can't seem to let go of, and for good reason. The game is one of the best game ever made, in my opinion at least, everything from the music to the actual game play, it's amazing. The developers worked really hard on this, and the game has a difficulty mode that is right for everyone. And not to mention, character creation used to have problems, but the developers actively worked on fixing it and not only fixed the problems, but made the system better on the eyes and much more user friendly.

overall, 13/10

13006,"I love this game so damn much bruh. played it for 3 days straight at one point, can be super addictive."
13007,its 2d minecraft but fun.
13008,ah terraria it not 2d minecraft its far from it it is a single or multiplayer experiance with tons to do i like the weapons aspect of it because it isnt rookie swords or bows its guns rocket launchers and many more there are wings mounts and 4 main classes meelee ranger mage and summoner but buy terraria at your own risk its very addicting which is a good thing that is what i think about terraria its a fun emmersive experiance and with mods its a never ending pool of content edit: i wanna say the dev team cares they ask the community for ideas as an ps main player with over 350 hours i can say it io so fun  just completed my second playthrough on ps and the enjoyment is out of this world
13009,its good
13010,Its a good game. You should play it.

13023,"I never really liked Minecraft, so when I was handed an Xbox360 version of this game, I was skeptic.  After putting many hours into the game, I realized that it was very outdated and didn't have a lot of the items that I was looking for to craft better gear.  So I decided to buy the PC version for myself.  I really wish that I could transfer a bunch of my stuff from the Xbox because starting over from scratch sucks.  I'm getting killed by mobs that I was killing with ease before, but oh well.  Though I love finding all new things on here that my other game didn't have.  In my opinion, this game is 1000 times better than Minecraft!!"

When you just start to play this game and played at list 1-25 hours it might seems to be boring,incomprehensible and hard but if you give the chance to present aspects of the game it most likely will be your favorite game or one of them."

As you know that the enchanted sword is underground, i went to my basement. When i went there skeletron just locked the door and left me to drink my own pee. But since i got the enchanted sword, i started using journey mode to get my rod of discord (i have it no question asked) then i teleported to other side of the door and beat the shit out of skeletron, i then went to the underworld, SCHOOL, I found hell stones there, something odd about it the hell stones are made of paper and it has confusing numbers in it. I made the Fiery greatsword as the 2nd sword i have.I then went flying to the air,i found a cheap gravity poition. But their names are Airplane, they cost alot and i had to grind platinum coins to get them, when i was 10.000 Ft in the air i jumped and just wishing to find the sky island to get star fury, lucky me i found it first try, Starfury was the 3rd sword. bala bla lbalba"

13097,"I love this game is it very fun and a great experience especially with friends there are so many things to do like defeat bosses, build houses, etc. I suggest that more people try terraria."
13098,MOON LORD TOO HARD
13099,The game is fun and the wiki for terraria is great.
13100,Good....
13101,This game is too good.
13102,pretty fun
13103,Niggers
13104,"Love this game,i have been playing terraria for 2 year i guess, well i play the cracked version before, and then i decide to buy this game becaus how i deeply in love with this game, the game just straight up extraordinary"
13105,This is a basic tile sandbox adventure game. I'm sure you probably know what it is or watched the trailer. If that's your cup of tea then this game's for you.
13106,"Poopy doocky game
"
13107,p good
13108,its a gud game
13109,"Game is chill if you want it chill; sweaty if you want it sweaty. Or, play in Journey mode, and just have fun building stuff. =)"
13110,it's addictive
13111,there is no escape
13112,its fun
13113,this game is actually pretty good must say
13114,yes
13115,"This game has SO much to do I have (on mobile) put hours on hours into this game. Highly recommend as this has so much to offer for a cheap price at 10$. So maybe before spending 20 on a cosmetic, consider buying this."
13116,smexy gaem recommended +1 veri hot many nice final update (real)
13117,good game
13118,Overated
13119,its fun if you have a lot of time or a person to guide you but the sheer amount of google you have to use is kinda crazy. I think that if you know what your doing or play with someone who knows what their doing its very fun but otherwise it would prob be a nightmare.
13120,"This game is flat out amazing and has good graphics 
and you can have a potato computer and it will run fine.

 If it doesn't just turn the graphics down and its
 fine and running definitely recommend for all ages viewers and players."
13121,So I am 11 hours in...pretty good game to be honest. Basically minecraft in 2D with more functionality.
13122,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
13123,Very fun and I love it a lot. You can probably find multiple essays elsewhere that express this further
13124,fun game called somebodies face 2d minecraft since they called the game 2d minecraft so thats that
13125,?
13126,"it's a game


perfect if you like spending hours getting marginally better at doing the same thing"
13127,"good
very good"
13128,good game
13129,God game buy now
13130,"I've had this game for almost 7 years now and somehow haven't written a review for it. It is one of my all time favorite games and every time I have the opportunity to play again, I jump on it. Hands down one of the best games I know."
13131,"Completely worth the money, easily the best game out there, with so much to do and so much to explore!
Would recommend this game to anyone that loves strategy, adventure, and combat!"
13132,this is a great game
13133,Terraria is  a amazing game. You have endless possibilities in this game. The only problem I have is that there is problems with cross play. I would like to be console and play with PC. now this may already exist however if it does it is extremely confusing.
13134,literally the best sandbox game ive ever played so thats a plus!!!
13135,"great game
get tmodloader for more fun"
13136,is ok ig idk
13137,"Great standalone, Even better with mods."
13138,epic
13139,amazong
13140,flat minecraft!
13141,"Fun, Excited for new update"
13142,fun but confusing and theres mods lots of mods  very good
13143,mhmm yuh huh
13144,Great game. Starts with a massive piece of gelatin attacking your world with a eye with several diseases. A while later a meaty wall tries to eat and stare at you. After that you kill massive metal animals with not just one eye with disease but two. Then kill special needs plant with a tiny eboy after. Then a group of friends who may be doing illegal crimes then kill calamari man.
13145,Good better than Minecraft
13146,Very fun to play with other people. Can get a bit boring if played in solo (unless you play with mods). Gets pretty boring after Moonlord if you don't have any plans on getting some mods
13147,awesome video game
13148,good.
13149,Truly exceptional. I don't think I've played a game this interesting in a long time. The best thing anyone could do would be to go in completely blind.
13150,BEST
13151,"1. Melee

13158,"This game is fun! 2 hours in one day, and alot of progress in those 2 hours."
13159,"put a few hours in, kinda good game"
13160,"Well what to say about Terraria..It's the equivalent of 2D Minecraft..Except it's really not it's a whole different game and honestly one of the best games ever made the fact that someone thought of making a game like this is truly mind boggling exploring is fun and the best experience you can get playing this game is with 2-4 friends just beating the game and forgetting about it for a while then replaying it (done that myself a couple of times). Honestly one of the greatest games ever made and a huge influence on future Open-World 2D ''Magical'' games this game deserves alot more recognition considering it took the basic assets of Minecraft and made it 30 times better..I have no words for this game 10/10 
"
13161,is good
13162,"nice game
"
13163,"I started playing this game with my boyfriend because he said it was one of his favorite games, and honestly? I can see why! Just building in this game has so many possibilities. It's very quickly growing on me and I definitely recommend it."

13355,"If you enjoyed Minecraft, but wished for a more in-depth crafting system, and amazing boss battles, this game is for you. I found it brutally difficult on Expert mode, but it made my final victory all the sweeter. This game is jam-packed with content, enemies, NPCs, and even a huge number of references to other media/fandoms. With a huge amount of (free) updates, it is no wonder Terraria wins Steam's ""Labour of Love"" award year after year."

13390,"people dislike the game beacuse its 2d, those people are retarded.

"
13391,I love this game
13392,"Such an addicting game, enjoyed every bit of it. Considering I don't have a gaming laptop, this is one of the games that I can actually launch and play smoothly, so that really adds to my experience. Soundtrack is also amazing, really puts me in a good mood when i come across videos using the game's soundtracks. I'm not great at combat so i can't say much about that, but it does get easier as you get stronger weapons and armor"
13393,Minecraft on steroids
13394,I would say this is one of the few Great games out there. Played on many platforms for countless hours. Yet I am still learning new things and finding more and more joy.
13395,"Terraria is a very great game that includes a LOT of things to discover and play around with. Terraria is best played with friends but that is not required to enjoy the game. Overall, Terraria is a fun game, I GREATLY recommend."
13396,Fun to play with friends
13397,it fun
13398,"BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
"
13399,good
13400,e
13401,this game is pure content
13402,2d minecartf game
13403,it cool :)
13404,"One of the best games I've ever played, really fun with coop. Challenging and fun. Love the art style and everything is great all around."
13405,Great game! Completed the game on my Xbox and it's just as good on steam. Would definitely recommend this game to anyone thinking of buying. It might be a bit grindy at times but still enjoyable the whole way through.
13406,so true
13407,e
13408,you know minecraft? this is nothing like that. this is one of the best games ive ever played. minecraft is not.
13409,gam ez
13410,it is good game
13411,"Terraria's easily on the Mount Rushmore of early-2010's-indie-games. The elephant in the room is that, yes, in fact, this game IS quite a bit like Minecraft! You build up a house and survive the night whilst zombies attack you, and you mine into the ground to get progressively better materials(at first, anyways). 

However, Terraria has a bit more to it than just that. Terraria has a greater focus on both boss fights and weaponry. The bosses are actual bosses, not just sword/bow sponges with 2 or 3 attacks, and the weaponry is very diverse, with 4 classes that you'll be able to choose from in the base game, all of which are pretty different from one another.

I'd say in terms of content, Minecraft is wider, but Terraria is deeper. Terraria doesn't have 20+ stupid meaningless features, it only has about 5, tops. Playing the game straight-up is highly fun, either with friends or by yourself. I'd say to 'beat the game' and kill the final boss would take you about 30 to 50 hours, if you weren't using a guide. With a guide(and not the NPC!), it would definitely take less time. 

I will mention that the endgame of Terraria is much weaker than Minecraft's. In Terraria, after you beat the final boss, there's not a lot for you to do. You get plenty of nice weapons, certainly, but what could you use them on?

Aside from the weak endgame, I'd say that Terraria is a superb game with a lot to do in it. If you decide to get into modding, it can get even better."
13412,Good.
13413,gud
13414,Possibly my favorite game of all time. It's that good.
13415,better than minecraft
13416,its good
13417,its good
13418,"Pretty fun sandbox game...
Has like a Million things to do, and all r fun...
This game has more RPG-like elements though, when compared to Minecraft...
Also, the grind and reward system isn't too tedious, but quite fun...
Just play for a few hours and u will get invested in the game...."
13419,terraria is cool
13420,minecraft modded 2d
13421,game crash never load
13422,"Yeah man, classic game. From way back when but absolutely still playable, absolutely enjoyable. Co-op slammaaaaaaaaa. Probably a starter for lots of people too. I think it's really cool."
13423,"After playing Minecraft since 2011, and trying Terraria out only recently with friends...

This game is eons better. More content, actual challenge and progression, amazing soundtrack, great bosses, built-in workshop browser using tModLoader, tons of customization to the game, and so so much more.
It's honestly baffling how much better this is than Minecraft, 60 hours and I still haven't even gotten half of the stuff in the game, only defeating the Moon Lord the day before this review. 

Buy this. Not only on sale, at any god damn time because it's that good"
13424,Terrific
13425,fun
13426,It is a very fun and challenging adventure.
13427,I want to fuck the Nurse so bad. I want her to be my dominatrix mommy. I want her to heal the wounds she inflicts on my cock and balls while she denies me ejaculation. When I play this I just sit by the Nurse and furiously masturbate to the thought of her.
13428,"Bro, over 650 hours and I still enjoy this game.

My recommendation:
Stop looking at the reviews; you're just going to find positive ones anyways, and just buy the game already. 
It is WELL worth your money. :)
15/10"
13429,yes
13430,"Better then minecraft
"
13431,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
13432,great game for a boss fight challenge
13433,play with firends please
13434,terar :)
13435,please add sex to the upcoming update
13436,Good game
13437,Play this game its fun XD
13438,super fun lots to do worth it
13439,"A really good game, 10/10"
13440,"A fun 2d adventure game that is similar to minecraft on the surface but is actually much more focused on exploration and combat rather than building, with a wide variety of gear to find and equip and tons of bosses to face making it a very fun and engaging experience solo or with friends"
13441,"Zis game very big adicition buy this on ur own risk i have 40h playtime in 1 week, i cant sleep if i know i havent defeated at least 1 boss, any way dont buy if u love ur time thanks!
"
13442,"I love this game! the bossfights are amazing and fun, and the exploration and sence of adventure is diffrent than any other game! this is a truly great game"
13443,"This is actually the best game I have ever played.  200 Hours in, there is still stuff for me to do! But, i'm not very good at this game, so you might be able to do things faster. Even after you beat the game, you have a ton of cool mods to play with! Even if you don't like mods, you can just start all over again, with a different class, challenge or playstyle and have just as much, if not more fun than you did the first time! Please try this game, I assure you it is NOT 2D-Minecraft."
13444,very amazing only cried a couple times during boss fights 0-0
13445,its yes.
13446,It's aight I guess
13447,fun
13448,"It's a very challenging experience for new players, but it's more fun as you learn and discover different features. I also enjoy how everything ties together, with every item having a purpose, no matter how small."
13449,:)
13450,Furry feet 18+ tentacles edition better?
13451,"this game is very good for players who enjoy exploring and adventure more than building. u can still build and stuff but i reckomend it for ppl who like adventure games.
i don't get why ppl call it 2D minecraft, minecraft doesnt have over 400 mobs and over 500 blocks. and since when did minecraft have 14+ bosses and flying eyes. only thing sililar to minecraft is a dirt block. if u say that zombies are a ripoff then u should realize they dont burn in the sun.
also minecraft doesnt require defeating bosses for better gear but in terraria its like (ok defeat that boss to have this and that boss to have that. in minecraft its like (go mining for hours (:
so thats it."
13452,One of the classics still holding out strong

13464,"One of my favorite games of all time. I've been playing since the first console release and on pc, the experience is just 10x better. A truly phenomenal game and a huge impact on my life."
13465,"We're no strangers to love

Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

(Ooh, give you up)
(Ooh, give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up

13466,"This is such a good game, with so much time and attention put into it. My biggest thing for open-ended games is that the world feels alive, which Terraria certainly is. From the start, you are put into a random world that will evolve in difficulty as you progress. Scattered throughout at little details that make things feel more immersive, such as growing environments. In Minecraft, for instance, you have biomes, but these biomes are location specific and do not grow themselves... This is a small example of nice details the developers have put into their game. Detail. The world feels alive. If you give space for it, other biomes will grow themselves and change the entire feel of the map. I love these little details!

But other than that? Terraria is great game for those who want an experience that slowly makes you feel like a powerful god, has clear, deep progression, and gives reason to strategize your progress to the next level.

I've played Terraria, perhaps as far back as 2013, and I give this game 10/10. It was great back then, and it continues to be great now!"
13467,uwu
13468,Fun game. Only thing I'm not a fan of is that characters & worlds aren't auto saved to the cloud. I lost my save when my ssd died.
13469,Good game
13470,BEST GAME EVER
13471,"Its fun
"
13472,.
13473,very fun
13474,its a good game lots of people are nice there and its fun
13475,Epic game! Once you get the hang of the game its super fun
13476,"It's like minecraft... But 2d... and since minecraft is the best selling game of all time this should be second for how amazing it is, The only downside is how hard the combat is and the sheer amount of fucken items like holy jesus. but overall 10/10 game"
13477,amazing yes
13478,"This game is SO MUCH FUN. I bought it to play with a friend, expecting it to be boring and confusing, but if you get a friend who has played it before, you just can't stop! So much fun, and hope you like it too!"
13479,"gut
"
13480,Great !
13481,really fun good bosses good wepons all around fun game
13482,"This game is so chock-full of content (almost to a fault) that you'll be able to sink hours into this game and almost NEVER get bored. There is so much to do, so much you can CHOOSE to do, that every playthrough is different. The bosses are fun to fight, building is fun (if you want it to be, nothing's stopping you from making a small, dirt box and calling it a day, which is equally as valid), and there are so many options for gear, furniture, pets, mounts, vanity, accessories, EVERYTHING. Don't be intimidated if you're not sure how to play at first. You'll learn over time and have the time of your life!"
13483,very fun especially with friends
13484,fun
13485,"It does bring a bit of a challenge but I like a good challenge. Overall, this game is quite fun to play and is great quality even being a 2-D type game."
13486,played a bit its alright i guess
13487,"A good game for anyone to have some fun, a challenge, or a nice party game in general. There's a lot of secrets, and new updates happen pretty regularly. You can sink hundreds of hours and the amount of bosses and such are crazy even in base game, and mods make it even cooler.

If you wanna play the Don't Starve world gen use world seed: constant
Just know it's more challenging than the base game"
13488,ta bien y barato :D
13489,"By far, one of the best games out there for anyone. The price is cheap and honestly the most entertaining game I've ever played."
13490,"Amazing game. It can be a little overwhelming at first, but you
ll understand it quickly. 10/10."
13491,"cool game
don't understand half off the stuff but
cool game"
13492,yes
13493,"This is such a great game, It has perfect graphics and great bosses and items. This game was out for 7 years and it will go on forever to be known as the greatest game."

13506,gud game.
13507, ENJOYABLE and great game play
13508,yeah
13509,Good game
13510,"I remember searching online for a free version of this game during my middle school years and found older versions to play for free and i played it for a couple hours. Years later i bought it and played it for a bit beat the wall and figured the game was done. My ex's little brother wanted to play games on pc so i gave him free reign on my steam account because i always wanted someone to give me access to a large video game library and he only played this game and racked up 200+ hours. I played the hardest difficulty with a buddy of mine a few years ago and I STILL HAVEN'T PLAYED PAST THE WALL OF FLESH.

TLDR: Loved this game since i was 13, ex's brother no lifed this game on my account, havent played the game past beating the wall of flesh 13 years later. I will get to the end i swear and you should too."
13511,gud game
13512,"This game is one of my absolute favourites. This game; it has everything: adventure, mining, building, fighting (and boss fights) and waaay more. It can be hard for new players to get in (I realized this while playing with friends that never played before) but honestly it really just calls for fun when playing multiplayer. Feels good dying to some random boss with your friends. Or defeating a boss. With your friends. Y'know what I mean. But even singleplayer this game is amazing, at least you don't have to share the world with a friend and can do what you want. You can do what you want. This is Terraria, you can do what you want.
No clue what I just wrote down, but I just wanna say this game is so damn amazing. Thanks Re-Logic, you all are amazing"
13513,Good Adventure/Survival Game in Sandbox style map with good progression of tool and upgrade.

fucking pixel game"

13522,The game is fun but it is really broken. My world got deleted after 140 hours playing and it stayed on 10fps after rebooting my pc.
13523,The best type of 2D survival games)
13524,i have played for much longer on my xbox but i have to say pc is like a whole new game.
13525,"Do you want your soul sucked out of you for the next 2 weeks or so? BUY THIS GAME. It's hella addictive with a distinct and loving soundtrack. Re-Logic overdid themselves with this one and for the record, no. This is not 2D Minecraft."

Music 10/10, Especially the Underground Hallow Theme
Gameplay, 9/10
Artstyle, 9/10
Overall, 10/10 just needed a bit of grind
and yes, use your creativity to build whatever you want

but there is a teeny weeny side effect to your mental state ruining your sanity as you progress, with dozens of events all happening at once when you are just fighting some boss, triple that side effect with Expert and Master Mode"
13547,EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
13548,I really like this game just base game is good its a really good time killer and if you get a few friends its even better but i will say the mods for this game are really one of the best thing you could get
13549,Minecraft more like Pisscraft Terraria is better
13550,"although it takes a bit of grinding, the game is very fun."

13567,yup.
13568,"Admittedly, not for everyone. It either lands really, REALLY well, or misses entirely. Depends on one's taste in game genre.

Otherwise, absolutely worth purchasing. No microtransactions, no outrageously priced DLCs. All content is free after the initial purchase, available to you without any additional purchases, and yet it gives you many, many more times the amount of content than that of other games that DO have nonsensical withheld gameplay content.

The devs literally won't stop releasing ""final"" updates."

There is just so many things to do, not enough for one playthrough. Overall, this game is great for playing with friends or alone. 10/10"

41.1% of people have the ""It's Hard!"" achievement."
13642,literally one of my favorite games like wtf
13643,"This is one of the most fun and addicting games I have ever played. The amount of content is staggering. The progression system is fun and interesting. You can choose practically any play style you could possibly imagine. I tend to get lost in the world, in the possibilities, in the  game as a whole.

One of my favorite parts of this game are the bossfights. There are 17 bossfights in all, and all of them are unique and engaging. (Except Golem. That guy's a joke as far as difficulty goes, but he's still fun. We've memed him into oblivion.)

One of the best parts of this game is the community. Veterans are kind and helpful to new players, and the Workshop, (when it's not taken over by horny programmers drawing huge tits on everything in the game) is full of impassioned and talented people who genuinely love the game, and want to add to the experience.

It's one of the few games where the devs seem to be a part of the community. Relogic is made up of wizards, and they love the game and community. I've seen people ask for something in the game on Reddit, and the team at Relogic just up and adds it without question. If you look into this game, you'll undoubtedly be bombarded by the FiNaL uPdAtE meme, but it really is true. The devs really seem as though they can't help but work on this game. I admire that kind of passion and pride in their work.

All in all, this is an amazing game in every way, shape, and form. It should be on every gamers list, whether they be casual, competitive, or simply creative. You won't regret it for a second."
13644,confuse
13645,"Fun fact: If you beat the game 5 times without dying once, Moon Lord actually becomes a naked zoologist, how crazy is that!"
13646,"don't do the fishing achievements, they aren't worth it."
13647,yes
13648,"Much better than Minecraft 
I really like the fact the devs care so much for their players

13670,this game is amazing i love it so much
13671,"After playing this game for a couple of years now, and after recently getting all in-game achievements I can say with confidence that this is one of those games I've come to love over the years, with the updates and new content being added by the ""Final update(s)"" of the game. The game is HIGHLY repayable and when you bring in friends for some added extra fun it becomes a whole new experience that helps the game keep fresh after countless worlds and characters are created. If you haven't experienced it I recommend you give it a try and determine if this is the kind of game that works for you, I know I adored every single hour of gameplay. If you like open-world games where you can play at your own pace, by building incredible structures or grinding for that one item you so hardly desired. Terraria has something for you to enjoy"
13672,"Primeiramente, eu n√£o tenho s√≥ isso de Terraria, sou um jogador que jogou PC de formas alternativas e depois comprei de forma oficial no pc em outubro de 2017 e joguei as vers√µes de PS3, PS4, e Mobile.

Terraria √© um jogo que √© bem divertido, n√£o √© extremamente complexo, √© relativamente simples, gr√°ficos em pixelart bem bonitos que funciona em um PC de baixa capacidade sem muita dificuldade.

Apesar de ser um jogo simples ele √© um jogo que tem uma alta dificuldade, nada como um jogo Souls ou rage/troll game, ele tem desafios dif√≠ceis e justos, para um iniciante em jogos pode n√£o ser uma boa escolha mas, se voc√™ gosta de um desafio, constru√ß√µes e tem amigos para jogar, compre, mas, tenha amigos, pois ser√° dif√≠cil de forma solo ou mesmo bem enjoativo.

digo que √© um jogo quase obrigat√≥rio para a conta da Steam e vale o pre√ßo sem promo√ß√£o mas, se achar quer pegar menos, espere um tempo, terraria fica em promo√ß√£o frequentemente.

Uma critica chata que possuo o espa√ßo largo que possui os Updates ao ponto de 2017 at√© 2020 ter tido nenhum update e o ultimo grande update ter sido o Journey's End em 2020, entretanto √© aceit√°vel pois cada update grande, √© uma nova ""revolu√ß√£o"" faz a espera valer a pena e dependendo de cada pessoa, pode ser at√© interessante recome√ßar o jogo anos depois s√≥ para poder sentir a experiencia dos novos conte√∫dos a cada grande update, enfim, tenha um bom jogo."

13681,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, created my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

13704,before i buy this game i was like this game is shit but when i played it i can easily sey that is one of my favorite games
13705,"This game is simply built different. Most people would assume that this is like 2d minecraft, but I say no. I say it is better minecraft. There is so much to explore with terraria and it has become one of my favorite games. There is a lot of difficulty in the game especially on the harder difficulties but it feels so rewarding to overcome the bosses. There is a bit of a learning curve to the game (as in research the wiki to learn it). Though once you learn the game, I guarantee you that this game will become one of your favorites."
13706,"I had a ton of fun playing this game with my friends. I definitely recommend this game.

10/10"
13707,amazing game has many chalenging bosses and gamemodes  and it is very fun

13735,is good
13736,"Terraria is a Minecraft that traded its 3D world for litterally everything else. One of my friends gifted it to me on my birthday, and I can't thank him enough!
Now lets talk about the game: It has a huge variety of mobs, ores, bosses and so many different weapons that i can't even remember half of them! And there are many different biomes too. My personal favourite are the sky islands. The only thing i dislike in this game is the fact that the map isn't infinite. And there is so much to do, that you basically can't get bored! 
I consider this game being a 10/10!"
13737,modded is really fun play that
13738,Terraria is like porridge.
13739,"So lets say hypothetically, you have a friend who in three hours doesn't let you kill the first boss, makes probably 10 graveyards, did less than 5 damage to a WORM, gives you his shoddy pickaxe and small axe every half a minute, blows you and the houses you made up (repair not included), gives you the critters he collected with his stupid fucking bug net, manages to die in the same pit like 15 times (which he managed to kill OTHER people while killing HIMSELF), dies to the weakest enemy in the game, gives you 5 goldfish and complains when you don't give them back (because you didn't look in your HOTBAR for them??), opens the doors so literally anything and everything can come in the house (even from other biomes), and has the strongest armor out of the group but dies tenfold compared to everyone else. If you have that friend, then please do NOT buy this game. Otherwise, fun game, I hate babysitting in video games (fuck you, Landon), 10/10."

13751,"Gotta be one of the greatest games of all time with an amazing system of classes and good game-play.
Very good if you or your friends got some money for a great game to enjoy together that isn't too expensive.

This game got some grind here and there and learning some stuff without a guide can be sometimes difficult but with tools in the game, mods (with Tmod) or online guides everything comes crystal clear at the end of the day."

All honesty, it is actually the best game ever, I cannot express how perfect the game is. Terraria has the best community I ever saw. The modding community as well is so amazingly perfect, best modders and people ever play this game. Just get this game"

13761,"I've been playing this game since 1.2, and it is honestly one of my favorite games of all time. Sure it will get somewhat grindy at times with mining and farming one type of enemy for a certain weapon but it's still a blast. The bosses are well designed and fun. The 4 classes are all a blast to play and I would highly recommend this game. It's a lot better with friends but it's still fun playing solo"

13781,A 2d game shouldn't be this fun.
13782,"if you are a steam user, this should automatically be in your library, stop reading reviews and buy this amazing game right now"
13783,"One of the best games I've played. It's hard to understand at first, but using the Wiki and watching videos help grow your knowledge of the game."
13784,"I've been playing this game for about a decade, and they still keep adding new things for all of us to enjoy. There are several quality of life improvements that have been added over the years that I never thought I needed while I was playing the game, but I can no longer imagine playing without them (things like quick stacking, quick stack to all nearby chests, and expert mode increasing drop rates).

I like a lot of games, but this one is still my favorite."
13785,its a game where you can build anything you want or kill all the bosses
13786,AWESOME GAME
13787,i like it

Shit got me acting aggressive and submissive"
13794,Moon lord makes my tip sticky.

13802,I died alot
13803,"its pretty good 
game is hard btw"
13804,HOW THE FUCK DO I EXIT OUT OF TERRARIA
13805,"This game explains nothing, the controls are absolute garbage, and the whole game feels like some shareware crap you'd install in 1992 on your Windows 3.1 only it's less fun. I have no idea why anyone thinks this game is good, but you couldn't pay me to play it.

To add to icing to the cake, the Terraria 'community' is pure trash. They write fake negative reviews and if anyone says anything bad about the game they get super butthurt. 

Any game that basically requires you to watch letsplays, read wikis, or have a friend explain shit to you is a poorly designed game, period. Maybe if I was 12 years old and had nothing better to do I can sit around for 10 hours learning the game before playing but I have better games to play on my backlog."
13806,good game

13828,"So many people claim this to be like minecraft, but they are so easily fooled by the surface level of early game terraria. The game is in my own words, ""A world that truly encapsulates the true idea of a Grand Adventure."" From the highest reaches of the sky, to the lowest levels of hell. There is ALWAYS something to find and new playstyles to try that i have found myself playing throughout the night just to fight the Moonlord in different ways."

13831,LOVE IT
13832,"I've played this game on console 1.2 for about 3 years (would not recommend lol) it's very good, recently got it on pc 1.4, much better, it's a very fun sandbox game and great to play with friends... and random people too! Great community"

13844,"Very fun game, not really much else to say, it isn't really friendly to new players though as there really isn't a in depth walkthrough so players can learn the ropes but as soon as you figure things out the game becomes very fun.  Sadly recently it has been stuck on the loading screen for me so I have not been able to play it."

13855,"surprised i didn't review this earlier. don't count my 3 hours of gameplay, i had another copy a few years ago. i enjoyed EOC and duke fishron. i figure people are past saying this in 2022 , but we all know anyone who still says terraria is a minecraft clone is full of shit. this game will easily cut hours out of your day once you get settled. soundtrack is a 10/10"
13856,Minecraft na modach w 2D co wiƒôcej powiedzieƒá
13857,"good game, fun
"
13858,"Quick note: THIS IS AN ACTUAL REVIEW FOR PEOPLE LOOKING TO BUY THIS!

To be perfectly honest, I think Terraria is amazing, a great game with difficult bosses. But after the first, maybe second time you beat it, it just stops being too fun. That's why tModLoader exists, to keep the fun going! So if you want a game that will keep you playing forever and ever that's actually entertaining and isn't a clickergame/tycoon this is the game. 10/10 game. Only issue is the fact that Re-Logic scrapped some cool bosses and now they're only exclusive to certain platforms ( like Ocram who is only on Old-Console versions of the game, like the XBOX360 version. Or Lepus on the 3DS. ) Luckily, I did buy these versions so I can experience the bosses but still, keyboard and mouse are way easier to me. 

Thanks for reading this really long review and have a good day :)"

14006,very nice
14007,Minecraft but 2D. Fun. lots to do. Multiplayer is the best player.
14008,"I never heard of this game till recent and I wasn't to sure about it. It was described to me as similar to Minecraft but in 2D. After playing it for several hours and haven't even finished it yet, I love it. Lots to do and discover and I think it is better than Minecraft. The only downside I have about the game as it doesn't walk you through on how to do things. You have to basically figure it out on your own but hey the internet has great tips and videos that have been very helpful."
14009,sus
14010,"very fun , especially when im playing with my friends"

14014,"good game
"
14015,"THIS is an amazing game it truly is an experience especially now when gaming has started to fall off and most games have started to become boring due to the sheer amount of new things in this game as you progress mods can easily and comfortably fit into the game meaning that even though it may not gain any more updates it will continue to change and evolve like new,thank you for you time."
14016,yes

14081,"Bought this in 2011 from the company.  It ran on a Chromebook.  Chromebook died, Terraria hasn't.  Repurchased through Steam.

The game is at least five times the content that I originally bought with everything that has been added, not to mention the modding community (haven't touched mods myself) that can add another two games worth.

Still playing this game 11 years later.  11/10 would absolutely recommend."

14114,"After playing this game I can confirm that this is in fact a good game.

If you're considering playing then I'd recommend watching a guide or two and whenever you're lost or confused go look at the wiki. The first time I was playing this game I had absolutely no idea what to do and the game's guide kinda sucks. Plus, some things you have to do to progress is weird. (Like throwing the guide into the burning pits of hell!)

The game's only 10 bucks too so do a favor for yourself and your wallet :)"

14119,Possibly one of the greatest 2d games ever created.
14120,This is top
14121,"One of the most fun sandbox/2D games you could ever play! I've played it across multiple platforms for many years and this game and its community are one of the best I've ever been a part of. It is always a joy to play a game with such caring developers/creators such as Terraria. Every second I've spent in this world has brought me nothing but joy (even when raging over bosses and questioning my decisions) Easily 10/10. I would recommend this game to anyone to play. Plus the items in this game (especially the weapons) are some of the best in any game, and the pixel art. Phenomenal!"

14157,"this is my 1st writing a review, 

I bought the game 2 years ago and it was an incredible solo experience. Then forget the game for a while until my friends bought it in the last sale, now I'm close to 90 hours of play in just a few weeks of gameplay. The multiplayer experience is on another level. We died a lot but also we laugh more and more. 

The only problem at the beginning that we have had is the crafting UI a bit complicated but We have had fun exploring and collecting materials that has been minimal. 

overall a great game. 

10/10
"
14158,Amazing game really fun and addicting. You got to play this game!
14159,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

14258,This is honestly one of the best games I've ever played. You dont need a great pc to run it but it has so much depth and so many options. Its a bit challenging but everything you do feels rewarding progression is strong and you never feel like things are bull even when you die its usually your own fault. This game borders perfection and you should play it NOW!

HOOOOO boy, this right here is by far my favorite game on steam. The progression is immaculate, the bosses are amazing, the exploration is satisfying... just, WOW. The music is outstanding, and the graphics(while pixelated) really match the sense of adventure and discovery. The bosses are absolutely amazing and test your skills extraordinarily well, with each boss kill giving an unreal sense of progression and satisfaction. Exploring the underground biomes and buildings never gets old, and just reeks of adventure. The second-half of the game(deemed ""hardmode"") is really when the game opens up, however you won't be getting any spoilers from me about it 'cause it's just that good. And don't get me started on the mods! Overall, just an absolutely outstanding game that reeks of passion both from the developers and the community. Although, do be prepared to grind some items for long periods of time.

14291,This game is amazing and I highly recommend buying it.  Some of the great things about this game is that the world is randomly generated which provides high replay ability.  The game is also updated often and there is a modding community as well.

14303,Pixel game
14304,zenith go brrrrrrrrrrr
14305,"i have played this game (if you add up the hours i have on mobile and on console) for ~1200 hours and it is my favourite game.
the amount of content in this 10‚Ç¨ game is incredible and the replay value is huge. there are 4 modes journey (not very fun) normal (good for first time players) expert (the best mode in my opinion) and master (which starts to be harder more than fun)  of course you can play using master mode which tests your skill at the game.
there are 4 classes in the game summoner melee ranger and magic and all of them have unique gameplay
when you buy the game you can use tMod Loader (terraria mod loader) and the ammount of mods that expand the game is uncountable (good examples: calamity, thorium).
the best part of the game has to be exploring (especially the caves) all of the biomes have unique mobs, accesories, weapons and more.
the game runs on virtually any computer (even on my toaster) so you ll be guaranteed to have decent fps while playing it.
this is and will be the best game i have ever played and i don t regret spending as much time as i have spent on Terraria.
my adivce to you is to convince your friends to play it with as it makes the game exponentally better and (if you cant spend the 10‚Ç¨) to wait untill it goes on sale or (if you want to play alone) pirate it and then decide if you want to buy the game when you ve made an informed decision.
i hope you at least give it a try."

8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced

Directions Below -

Step 1
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.

Step 2
Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.

14335,"Apparently never did a review for this.

Far more than ""2d minecraft"", Terraria has a vast amount of bosses with different mechanics, multiple classes to build into, and an amazing variety of biomes and places to explore within one world. Contains an amazing amount of content for single or multiplayer.

It's a great game all around."

14341,"Playing alone, or playing with others, you can't be disappointed by this game. It's fun once you build your foundation, and keeps you on your toes for what appears to be a simple game on the surface. The more you dig, or the more you fly, the more you uncover. One of my classic favorites <3"

14365,One of the best games I've ever played. I love the sense of humor
14366,I want to curb stomp the angler.... 10/10 game
14367,"This game is a modern day classic along with Minecraft... If you haven't played it yet, your missing out. The 1.4 update has wrapped everything up perfectly, and provides COPIOUS amounts of content throughout the entire game. Also, if for whatever reason you feel there is not enough content, the Terraria modding community is only rivaled by that of Minecraft so you can add hours upon hours of extra content to the game through TModloader which is now officially available through Steam."
14368,Kill boss get loot fun game
14369,tree.
14370,pog
14371,7/10
14372,it's aight
14373,Yes
14374,"fun with friends forr 100 hr then gets repetitive
"
14375,"If you're ever sick of the repetition of Minecraft, then this is the place to go. There is just so much to this game and stuff I'm willing to bet I still don't know exists in it. Usually if I'm playing a creative or survival game I will have music going on in the back round, but not for this one since every song is an absolute banger and puts you into the setting. It is by far probably one of my favorite games to play with friends. I plan on playing calamity for the first time very soon as well. Overall this game definitely is something I will continue to play whether it updates more or not."
14376,its good
14377,"A Very Entertaining Game
The game may not have the best graphics when compared to other games, but, it more than makes up for it in terms of gameplay. Due to the multitude of weapons and tools in the game itself, you can spec out into a few different classes which gives you a lot to mess around with. 
In terms of difficulty, when you first start playing the game, you may find it a bit difficult as you may not know what to do. But, after talking to the first NPC you encounter and doing some exploring,  you'll get the hang of it in no time. Once you've finished the game on normal difficulty, you can go on to play on higher difficulties. Higher difficulties will give you more loot from bosses which will give you a slightly different experience than when you played the game on normal. 
You can mod the game too.
10/10 would recommend"
14378,This game is like that one scene in Better Call Saul 10/10!
14379,terrungle bum fungle
14380,"its good erly game is slow, and the only problem is that the mune is acsest thro the inventory, also you cant lock I tems like on ps4 but ive folowed the game on ps3 back when the drax was the best"

14386,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

14391,Game very sexy
14392,"This game is very gameplay heavy. No real cosmetics or decoration, only building and fighting what you need. The comparison to minecraft is a joke, as minecraft has both good combat and good decoration, while terraria only has good combat. Still an amazing game if you like that sort of thing"
14393,ITS uhmmm urrrr uhmmmmmm urrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa umhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ahhhhhhhhhhhh eeeeeeeeeee aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr like em errrrrrrrrrr but emmmmmmmmmmmm like em what errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr fun
14394,"Really in-depth, self explanatory game. Tons of awesome bosses, weapons, blocks, and armor sets. There are four damage classes with their specific armor sets. The four in strongest to weakest are Melee, Mage, Ranged and Summon. My favorite is ranged because it lets you keep enemies at bay and has in my opinion the most powerful weapons as some stages."
14395,one of the best games ever 10/10 and nothing like minecraft at all
14396,Includes human offering.

14432,really fun game sadly i completed it quite early but yet it;s still very fun!
14433,"amazing
"
14434,Very good game
14435,"Terraria has had a great run, heavily rewarding players for their creativity, be it in coming up with ways to beat difficult bosses, or for simply creating aesthetic builds. I've played with siblings and friends, and can recommend that trying to beat the game on master mode with a bunch of monkey-brains is both incredibly enjoyable, whilst also managing to bring you down to a darker place then you have ever known. Every Terraria player knows the feeling of elation as they obtain their first pair of wings. Fly high Re-Logic, looking forward to what you release next."

14442,"This game is sorta fun in single player, but in multiplayer, THAT'S when it gets good. its even better if no one knows what they're doing. you all get to mess up together and it is a good time. the art style is also great and the modding community is amazing. 110% recommended with friends."

14456,amazing
14457,"I know many people who say that Terraria is just a 2D Minecraft. I understand some of the similarities like zombies, slimes, some ores, ...trees but there are SO MANY DIFFERENCES between the 2 games. Terraria has more ores, bosses, enemies, weapons, blocks/tiles, wings that actually make you fly. In other words: Very funi cool gaem!"

I could play this game over and over again just to get the same ending. I mean, you have to admit that the amount of items in this game is incredible, and there are so many possibilities and different builds to choose from and the building in this game is just dope as shit as well as boss fighting but Minecraft is cool too."

Welcome to the World of Terraria. A land full of mystery and wonder, with much of its destiny left up to the wildest imaginations... however, a few legends of old have made their way to our present time. Passed down by countless generations of the Order of the Guide, these few scraps of information will serve to help you navigate your journey and overcome threats lurking in the shadows. This knowledge is now passed on to you, the brave adventurer, with the hope that it will aid you in your quest to save our world...

In the beginning, the Gods established a balance to guarantee fairness for all living creatures. This balance was to be of paramount importance, with no cost too great in seeking its fulfillment. Eons have passed since the Gods first began testing the complexities of life in their fairness experiment. In this process, countless living worlds were created and now exist within the Terraria universe. Each world of Terraria is a sentient being that knows all that goes on and can feel the thoughts of all living creatures: with their sole purpose being to ensure that the desired balance is maintained ‚Äì often violently so. The worlds utilize many defense mechanisms to ensure the balance is upheld at all costs ‚Äì some of them are known as the Hallow, Corruption, and Crimson.

The Crimson
The Crimson is a single emergent living being connected directly to each world, sharing a hive mind, and solely focused on restoring balance at all costs. Thousands of worlds before the one on which you stand now have been absorbed by this being. Many misguided people have made the horrific mistake of raising the Crimson to the level of a deity ‚Äì conducting human sacrifices to it to placate the monstrosity or seek its favor. The Crimson gladly consumes these bodies, becoming one with them and producing terrifying beings, who lose the ability to feel and blindly follow the hive mind.

The Corruption
The Corruption is a cancer caused by the sins of those living in the worlds of Terraria. The vile actions and thoughts present in all beings feed the growth of the Corruption as it spreads relentlessly across each world. The Corruption knows nothing else but to consume everything it touches, leaving behind terrible creatures of hate that exist for the sole reason to cause pain in punishment for the unearned pleasure experienced by living things. After the Corruption restores balance to life, it destroys it with the goal of turning the world into a desolate abyss void of life.

The Hallow
The Hallow, on the other hand, is of an entirely different nature. Within each world is a Guardian who serves as the worlds[sic] master and core. Once this creature is destroyed the world will release the Ancient Spirits of Light and Dark to expedite the process of finding a new Guardian. It is here when the Hallow is created and functions as an overcompensation of purity, taken to the absolute extreme. The Hallow cures threats that would attempt to violate the critical balance of life, killing anything in its path as though it were treating an infection ‚Äì whether friend, foe, or neutral party. Ultimately, the Hallow serves to push back against the never-ceasing encroachment of control.

Your World
It is against the backdrop of this precious balance of life, desolation and pain that the great battles of legend and the adventures of our time take place. In the blind spot of the universe, there exists a planet of unprecedented potential: your world!

Your story begins with Cthulhu ‚Äì a creature of immeasurable power and unknown origin ‚Äì who arrived long ago with its seemingly sole purpose being to rain destruction on and to have dominion over all the sentient life that flourishes on your world.

None could stand against the advances of Cthulhu. The very fabric of Terraria itself seemed on the precipice of doom. At last, when all hope seemed lost, the ancient race of Dryads arose to wage battle against Cthulhu. The Dryads, with their unparalleled connection to the planet, were Terraria's truly last hope as they joined together to save all life from annihilation.

The Dryads were alas unable to kill Cthulhu. However, with the Dryads [sic] combined power they were able to cripple Cthulhu's ability to wreak further damage on Terraria by ripping out Cthulhu's eyes, part of its skeleton, and chunks of its brain. Ultimately this substantial damage forced Cthulhu to retreat to the dark side of the moon, where it dwells to this day, gathering strength for another attempt at total conquest. As for the Dryads, sadly, all but a single member perished... and the sole survivor has not been seen for many, many years.

Lunatic Cult
Much time has passed since the Great War of Cthulhu. However, rumors tell of a Lunatic Cult led by a fanatical zealot that is methodically seeking to revive Cthulhu to its former power and bring about the end of the world. As a part of these efforts, a renowned genius ‚Äì known simply as the Mechanic ‚Äì has been kidnapped and forced to rebuild the parts needed to make Cthulhu whole once again. Hushed whispers tell of the results of these experiments: horrible mechanical simulacrums of Cthulhu's organs. The Mechanic has nearly completed her work, only needing to finish the Mechanical brain to restore Cthulhu to its full destructive power.

Passing travelers hear construction and screams emanating from the Dungeon ‚Äì an evil, demonic fortress of the dead in which the Mechanic is supposedly held prisoner as she conducts her work.

Many across Terraria have fallen under the possession of the cult, including the benevolent Old Man who oversees the Dungeon, a once thriving city full of life until a curse forced all its inhabitants to go mad ‚Äì living beyond the point where their bodies rotted away and they became mindless undead servants of evil. Without some intervention, some force to stem this tide, some hero to save the day, Terraria's doom is nigh at hand!

This brings us to our adventure. It begins with you ‚Äì in humble beginnings and shown your path by the faithful and mysterious Guide. As this world's champion, you will experience communications from the world to help protect your mission. The world has brought you to this specific location at this specific time ‚Äì will you stand up and fight for Terraria against the growing shadows of impending doom?"

14635,"Terraria is an amazing game. It‚Äôs a game that‚Äôs been with me my whole life. I‚Äôve played it my whole life but I always keep coming back to play. I‚Äôve played (and play) on Xbox, switch, PC and even my phone. It‚Äôs just nostalgic and just so fun."

14673,I love how a 2d platformed game turned into something you can really get to love ever since 1.1 which was believed to be the last update i was really sad wanted the game to keep going. As they said it was originaly the final update but they kept going never gave up and now everybody is excited for if their is a 1.5 I was super excited when they announced master mode. The designs of every enemy or boss and theyre creative mechanics show that they put hard work into this heck they even put good art into the achievements

14693,"Warning: Very Addictive Game

I've had this game for about 6 days and 12 hours and I managed to put in 47 hours and beat Moonlord.

[u] [b] WARNING: OFTEN AN ANNOYING RNG GRINDING SIMULATOR [/b] [/u]

In my 47 hours of gameplay I've probably spent 20 hours or more grinding enemies and bosses for RNGesus to bless me. Sadly he never came. You have no idea how much pain I was in while grinding Rusty Armored Bones (one of the dungeon's most common post-Plantera enemies) just trying to get the goddamn Adhesive Bandage (his most common drop) to slap it on a shield. And by pain I mean KILLING ALMOST 400 OF THEM JUST TO GET MANY DUPLICATES OF HIS RAREST ITEMS AND ONE BANDAGE LIKE WTOJFHUAEWBNJVGIHNJKONRAEGFGNHOIRGBOK. During this painful escapade, I was also grinding Bone Lees in order to get the Black Belt and Tabi to become the master of [strike] puppe [/strike]ninjas. It felt like I was the unluckiest man alive and was wasting my time as I was killing Mr. Lee for probably half an hour as he dropped only coffee. However, after those 30 minutes, the tables were turned approximately 85 degrees as I got my first Black Belt. Then, not long later I would find myself obtaining my first Tabi. Did you notice how I said 'first' and not 'a'? Well that's because WHILE GRINDING FOR MY SPONGEBOB PATTERNED BAND-AID I GOT 2 MORE BLACK BELTS AND 5 MORE TABIS IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. WHERE IS THIS LUCK WHEN I DON'T HAVE THE ITEM? Aside from the mental agony; this grind did get me a lot of money. Luckily, I only had to kill 2 Corruptors to get my Flinstone Vitamin Gummies. Finally, I had the ingredients to make a special piece of paper of which I taped to my skull-engraved shield.

Long story short: 10/10 game"

As of this time, I'm pretty much ready to defeat the WoF, so yeah, I played a bit.

14718,good game very rewarding if you dont use all items world

14720,This game makes you live life in hard mode
14721,"yes
i thought a friend wasted his money to gift me this game but many months later im addicted but CANT EVEN BEAT EYE OF CTHULHU"
14722,ye
14723,you can use a toilet
14724,"Really good game, although it's kinda hard to get used to at first. Trust me, this sandbox is definetely worth the try."
14725,"I am not a 13 yo father, probably one of the stupidest people playing this game. I am not a single father to my Son, who is 0 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 1942 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son. So i decided to steal a son's Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my son for help and he said I should kill myself because I write these dumbass reviews under every game."
14726,It's good mang
14727,good
14728,"My fav2 game
this game is rly GREAT"
14729,goot came
14730,Good
14731,How have you not played terraria? a sin for those who haven't
14732,also try minecraft.
14733,yes
14734,"both of my worlds were corrupted
fuck this game
still pretty fun though"
14735,"i recommend this game to anyone who is interested in adventure games.This game has alot of items to discover and mostly the mobs.This game is probably more interesting than minecraft,but thats just my opinion.Whoever thinks this game is bad,you should reconsider that choice,maybe you will like the game."
14736,i hacc
14737,Pretty good game because the content of the game
14738,"killer soundtrack, many much fun, very replayable
10/10"
14739,"Honestly, i couldn't last while trapped alone with the nurse. 100% recommend for my lgbtq community"
14740,fav game ever <3
14741,"Action packed and endless fun, with so many things to do throughout the game, however it lacks a guide so often times you'll have to look online for help, but other than that, super super fun and entertaining. Full of bosses and NPCs that can aid you on your journey, can be a little difficult at times but settings are adjustable for each world/character. Would definitely recommend."
14742,Good Game :)
14743,"Terraria is a really fun game, it takes elements of Minecraft (hence why it's called 2D MC by a lot of people).
It's the standard, but imo great survival game beginning where you start with nothing and have to build and and get weapons and tool, the NPC and money systems are great aswell as all the accesories. You can buil your own style of playing and also play in different classes to make it more challenging. It's very replayable which is also why it's so fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes survival games where you start with nothing."
14744,cool
14745,awesome
14746,Better then minecraft.

14798,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

14835,"Lore text
Welcome to the World of Terraria. A land full of mystery and wonder, with much of its destiny left up to the wildest imaginations... however, a few legends of old have made their way to our present time. Passed down by countless generations of the Order of the Guide, these few scraps of information will serve to help you navigate your journey and overcome threats lurking in the shadows. This knowledge is now passed on to you, the brave adventurer, with the hope that it will aid you in your quest to save our world...

In the beginning, the Gods established a balance to guarantee fairness for all living creatures. This balance was to be of paramount importance, with no cost too great in seeking its fulfillment. Eons have passed since the Gods first began testing the complexities of life in their fairness experiment. In this process, countless living worlds were created and now exist within the Terraria universe. Each world of Terraria is a sentient being that knows all that goes on and can feel the thoughts of all living creatures: with their sole purpose being to ensure that the desired balance is maintained ‚Äì often violently so. The worlds utilize many defense mechanisms to ensure the balance is upheld at all costs ‚Äì some of them are known as the Hallow, Corruption, and Crimson.

The Crimson
The Crimson is a single emergent living being connected directly to each world, sharing a hive mind, and solely focused on restoring balance at all costs. Thousands of worlds before the one on which you stand now have been absorbed by this being. Many misguided people have made the horrific mistake of raising the Crimson to the level of a deity ‚Äì conducting human sacrifices to it to placate the monstrosity or seek its favor. The Crimson gladly consumes these bodies, becoming one with them and producing terrifying beings, who lose the ability to feel and blindly follow the hive mind.

The Corruption
The Corruption is a cancer caused by the sins of those living in the worlds of Terraria. The vile actions and thoughts present in all beings feed the growth of the Corruption as it spreads relentlessly across each world. The Corruption knows nothing else but to consume everything it touches, leaving behind terrible creatures of hate that exist for the sole reason to cause pain in punishment for the unearned pleasure experienced by living things. After the Corruption restores balance to life, it destroys it with the goal of turning the world into a desolate abyss void of life.

The Hallow
The Hallow, on the other hand, is of an entirely different nature. Within each world is a Guardian who serves as the worlds[sic] master and core. Once this creature is destroyed the world will release the Ancient Spirits of Light and Dark to expedite the process of finding a new Guardian. It is here when the Hallow is created and functions as an overcompensation of purity, taken to the absolute extreme. The Hallow cures threats that would attempt to violate the critical balance of life, killing anything in its path as though it were treating an infection ‚Äì whether friend, foe, or neutral party. Ultimately, the Hallow serves to push back against the never-ceasing encroachment of control.

Your World
It is against the backdrop of this precious balance of life, desolation and pain that the great battles of legend and the adventures of our time take place. In the blind spot of the universe, there exists a planet of unprecedented potential: your world!

Your story begins with Cthulhu ‚Äì a creature of immeasurable power and unknown origin ‚Äì who arrived long ago with its seemingly sole purpose being to rain destruction on and to have dominion over all the sentient life that flourishes on your world.

None could stand against the advances of Cthulhu. The very fabric of Terraria itself seemed on the precipice of doom. At last, when all hope seemed lost, the ancient race of Dryads arose to wage battle against Cthulhu. The Dryads, with their unparalleled connection to the planet, were Terraria's truly last hope as they joined together to save all life from annihilation.

The Dryads were alas unable to kill Cthulhu. However, with the Dryads [sic] combined power they were able to cripple Cthulhu's ability to wreak further damage on Terraria by ripping out Cthulhu's eyes, part of its skeleton, and chunks of its brain. Ultimately this substantial damage forced Cthulhu to retreat to the dark side of the moon, where it dwells to this day, gathering strength for another attempt at total conquest. As for the Dryads, sadly, all but a single member perished... and the sole survivor has not been seen for many, many years.

Lunatic Cult
Much time has passed since the Great War of Cthulhu. However, rumors tell of a Lunatic Cult led by a fanatical zealot that is methodically seeking to revive Cthulhu to its former power and bring about the end of the world. As a part of these efforts, a renowned genius ‚Äì known simply as the Mechanic ‚Äì has been kidnapped and forced to rebuild the parts needed to make Cthulhu whole once again. Hushed whispers tell of the results of these experiments: horrible mechanical simulacrums of Cthulhu's organs. The Mechanic has nearly completed her work, only needing to finish the Mechanical brain to restore Cthulhu to its full destructive power.

Passing travelers hear construction and screams emanating from the Dungeon ‚Äì an evil, demonic fortress of the dead in which the Mechanic is supposedly held prisoner as she conducts her work.

Many across Terraria have fallen under the possession of the cult, including the benevolent Old Man who oversees the Dungeon, a once thriving city full of life until a curse forced all its inhabitants to go mad ‚Äì living beyond the point where their bodies rotted away and they became mindless undead servants of evil. Without some intervention, some force to stem this tide, some hero to save the day, Terraria's doom is nigh at hand!

This brings us to our adventure. It begins with you ‚Äì in humble beginnings and shown your path by the faithful and mysterious Guide. As this world's champion, you will experience communications from the world to help protect your mission. The world has brought you to this specific location at this specific time ‚Äì will you stand up and fight for Terraria against the growing shadows of impending doom?"

The game is brilliant, the world is so detailed and there is so much to do, i recommend this game to any that's considered buying it.

10/10 Game"
14866,"You should play this game definitely!!! First timers should definitely use Fisherman class it is the most simple and basic class to use, gear/tools in the Fisherman class are relatively easy to learn and don't require a lot of grinding to achieve. @Tofu Bear if you'd like to play any time DM me."
14867,nice game.

14871,"Great game 10/10 very fun XD so fun really good game XD lmao - Mr. Midnight














It's actually an amazing game though, maybe better then minecraft, and it's honestly been amazing playing this game all these years, going from wii u, to 3Ds, to ps4, to Computer. honestly buy this game if you want an amazing game to play"
14872,terraria more like suckraria
14873,i say fight foot creep oh walking with that heater
14874,yeah its pretty good
14875,This is a fun game with a steep incline but once you really get rolling its worth it.
14876,Very good with lots of content you should get it if u havent what are you doing with your life not playing this game its only 10 dollars!
14877,
14878,I love that you get addicted until you finish it and then leave and then comeback again to try something new. Pretty cool!
14879,yes
14880,mom hot yes
14881,"Great sandbox-survival game! Can be a little daunting, but the customisability of your worlds - from the difficulty to the seed itself - helps keep the game in [i]your[/i] ballpark.

The only real downside is the grinding involved to get some of the items; however, you do have help in the form of battle potions and blue candles to increase the spawn rates of enemies, thus reducing the time spent grinding/farming significantly.

Don't like fighting? Don't worry! You can reduce the spawn rates of enemies via sunflowers, peace candles, and potions! Alongside that are various activities you can do to relieve stress, such as fishing, which includes various quests, or golfing, which can be done pretty much anywhere!

Excellent pick for people who love spelunking, combat, fishing, golfing, or [i]literal[/i] worldbuilding!"

14892,VERY FUN DADDY
14893,"Great game with am immense amount of content, always fun to come back after a while to try a different approach. The wide variety of content makes the progression feel smooth and rewarding when overcoming hurdles. 10/10 would replay again and again"
14894,Fun but VERY CONFUSING
14895,very good game i enjoyed.verygood.yes.
14896,it has good terrain generation and interesting stuff lol
14897,minecraft did it first
14898,"This game came into my life at a time when me and my friends weren't gaming together as often and I wanted to find something to lose myself into while solo gaming. It did not disappoint...its like a dark souls games. You die alot until you get a hang of what gear and items you need to succeed. 10/10 recommend having the wiki on a bookmark on a secondary screen or your phone while gaming, lots of GREAT information and love was put into it that helps you figure things out and learn how to deal with bosses that arent explicitely explained in game. I would gift this to anyone I could just because it deserves the love it gave me when I started playing."

14903,"[h1] Terraria is a great game. [/h1]

I've followed it from the very beginnings. Its one I played for years on four different accounts with every possible build option. I've built many great looking houses and defeated many enemies hundred of times. I am trying to better myself with master difficulity but it is tough as nails. It is fun to play alone and its great with friends. Time just vanishes as you play because the world and what to do's just sucks you in. But here are some pro's and con's with the base game.

Pro's:
- When you fight a boss you feel awesome and it feels great to defeat them.
- There are many funny deaths and its easy to just laugh at your failure.
- The progression is very good, its balanced enough that you really can measure how much a suit of armor helps or a better sword does.
- You can customize yourself in many ways and can do head canon stories for your character.
- Playing with friends makes the game more difficult but also fun.
- The music is great.
- Easy to learn hard to master type of game, when you try the higher difficulities you really need all you can get. Buffs, potions, accessories, reforges, and the nurse becomes so much more handy.

Con's:
- Fishing and other randomly decided things can get annoying to do. When you need just that one special thing and it has a 1% drop chance you really need to grind and in the end it leaves you with a bit bitter taste at the end.
- Sometimes you just get upset when you die and it can be difficult in single player to respawn the bosses and waves every time because when you die they go away (except if there are other players alive). 
- There are sort of classes in the game, but it changes as you progress. It would be really nice if all class options would be avaiable trough out the whole game and even it would be better if there would be more classes.
- The game doesn't hold your hand. It doesn't tell you if you need to build a structure to fight a boss or a wave. It would be nice if it would tell you to build an arena to have a better chance againts some.
- It gets tedious to manage the chests as you progress with lot of loot and you need crafting stations close to each other to see recipes.

But overall it is a great game to purchase and play. It is worth the full price but there are many times when it goes on sale. 

Also there is the tModLoader you can get for it to download mods to make the game even more refined and great. There are a couple of fantastic mods to try too.

I hope I helped a little."
14904,meh
14905,"Play this, get laid."
14906,love the game play
14907,Really good game
14908,it's fun
14909,great game with loving devs
14910,"cool game
/"
14911,"dududu du, du"
14912,"It is very fun and i has made me play it for 3 days straight 10/10 would recomend
"
14913,Best game
14914,"ah, terraria. i come from the days of when this game was available for ps3 with its exclusive content and all. despite the awful console control-scheme that this game has on platforms outside of pc, i never really played the pc version.

but despite my low experience with the pc version, i'm surprised how familiar i am with things here and how much things have changed between the 1.2-ish console version and this. very different experience between the two versions. but regardless, terraria itself is still an amazing game worth playing, regardless of platform. easily hundreds, if not thousands of hours of content in this game. especially on pc when you have modding support, including the brilliant tmodloader. though not sure if that works on linux (never checked or tested), but for windows users i guess it's an amazing convenience.

the linux port of this game runs brilliantly too. my crappy linux laptop is able to run this game on manjaro very well and i'm genuinely happy about that.

one of the must-owns on steam with no exaggeration. full price or discount, this game is worth it either way."
14915,"REALLY, LIKE REALLY ADDICTING. Amazing gam with amazing spritework and visuals."
14916,ddddddd
14917,is 3-5
14918,"If I could pick one game to forget entirely so that I could experience it again for the first time, it would be this one."
14919,I love this game but im never playing it unmodded again
14920,Great game to play with friends. 8/8. Highly recommend.
14921,"good game indeed, best game?"
14922,"If you like platform games you will definitively love this game it has a lot of bosses, mini bosses, items. You can explore every inch of the map without a care and build your imagination. Plus there are different difficulties to the game and if you want to challenge yourself you can play the most hard difficulty that its name master mode. Its a really fun game to play with friends or alone the same time."
14923,good
14924,.
14925,This is the best game ever. i promise you will like it and its a really cheap game. must buy

14937,YES

14939,Don't play mastermode unless you want to truly rage.
14940,"It was hard to understand at first. But after 2 or 3 hours of playing with some friends i finally got the hang of it and have started to like the game more. Honestly, this game is a masterpiece, there is so much to offer and its so easy to understand after you get the basics done. I recommend this game to all people"

14945,"This is such a great game, i played it first around 7 years ago on my 360 and i loved it , today it is still such a great game and i would recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it , it is more fun with friends but can still be enjoyed alone! :) 
-also its a steal for the price of it.

14960,this game is good but your broke so yeah
14961,its cool
14962,never played before
14963,"Overrated , this game was most highly rated game on steam at one point because of 2020 lockdown and all boomers played this game and rated high.

Graphics suck, Game is in 2D. Are we living in 90s?
Gameplay is garbage , kill sponges with wooden sword and chop trees to make house .
There are far better options like rust,minecraft,the forest, valheim with better graphics and building mechanics
People who are playing this sorry excuse for a video game in 2022 need a wakeup call. WAKE UP! its not 80s anymore , 8 bit graphics is a thing of past.

15033,I don't know how to play this game.. but it's great
15034,day eol my beloved
15035,Also play minecraft
15036,"it's time killing. You will have good times with friends. However, after clearing the classic mode,  everyone just became lazy and not even want to try out the mods.
Perhaps, I will play it again in time."
15037,"This masterpiece of a game takes you through a journey, not only going to hell and back, but so much more beyond! It is a wonder on how you can get carried away playing the same game from so long ago, but I keep finding myself going back into this game time and time again, reliving the journey I fell in love with as a kid. As for difficulty scaling, it can go anywhere from a peaceful building game where you can express yourself, or recreate whatever you may want, to a game where any wrong step could mean instant death. I think the four choices of difficulty truly serve as a good outline for so many people's style of playing! I love this game, and it will always be one of my favorites!"

15039,Yes :D

15066,"I'm not here just to be the odd one out. I can't compete against the overwhelmingly positive comments. But I didn't like it. It seemed to be extremely childish and meant mostly to children / teenagers.

But hey, don't hate me. It's probably a fantastic game. Not for my taste. But a fantastic game."

15068,"I first got Terraria because a couple of my friends played it. We now have a multiplayer world together. I had fun with my friends exploring our world and fighting enemies unique to certain areas. These different areas or biomes, allow you to find unique resources to craft tools and blocks to use or trade with NPCs. There are so many different bosses, biomes, things to craft and achievements to earn, theres no way you can get bored. I recommend this game to anyone who haves $10 to spare and at least 15 minutes of free time even if that 15 minutes only comes once in a while. The only time I wouldnt recommend this is if someone dosent want to have to work to progress."

As time has gone on for this game i enjoy it like i did even after 975hrs here and 4 1/2 thousand on console. When i was much younger starting this game off and not knowing a lick of info to now being amazing at this game. Being apart of this games progression has been a journey and a half but i learn new things here and there myself. I've built numerous AFK farms and  arenas for whatever i may be fighting tough or easy. I been playing again but this time with a new group of friends many of which have never played before and it's amazing to show them this gem of a game and be able to laugh have fun and even make new homes and memories...To the long haul"

I FUCKING LOVE TERRARIA"
15132,i've played for over 69 hours good game
15133,game is very sus just like among us and this makes me coom
15134,"As a new player on terraria, i must say i am disapointed, when i saw the co-op between Terraria/Don'tStarve i thought they would be alike on fun, they were not, i do not recommend this game, in my opinion the progression rate is too slow, but mostly i didn't have any joy with it, when i play, something just have to ""click"" on me, i didn't feel it at all in here."
15135,great game to always play with your friends or alone
15136,Waiting for the addition of the Chimkem Numgit.
15137,Just try it.IT is not just 2D minecraft
15138,It's a fun game after you get past pre-hardmode people just aren't very patient and don't give it time to get to the fun part.
15139,"Great game with a lot of good content and a, currently unstable, modded content. Easily the best game I own, and my favorite as can be seen by my 800+ hours. 9/10"
15140,"Terraria is a great solo or multiplayer game.  There's a lot of items to gather and biomes to explore, which is fun enough in and of itself without adding on the bosses to beat and various NPCs to provide homes for.  I am playing with my husband and my 11 yo son and all of us are enjoying it, which is rare since we generally like very different games."
15141,fun game

15148,"Herman Melville‚Äôs iconic 1851 video game Terraria is an undisputed American classic. Since it was first published, it‚Äôs been translated into 22 languages and received international acclaim, with more than 50 million copies sold worldwide.

For those who don‚Äôt know, this epic maritime tale follows Captain YOURPLAYERNAMEHERE on an obsessive mission for revenge. His target is a giant MOON LORD who bit off his leg on a previous voyage. The story is told from the perspective of a sailor named YOURCHARACTERNAMEHERE, who watches on in awe at the captain‚Äôs erratic quest to dominate nature.

If you‚Äôve not played terraria, don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt spoil it for you. In this article, I‚Äôll just give you a little teaser in the form of the opening and closing lines of the video game. I‚Äôll also throw in some fun facts about this classic tale that even fans of the video game might not know about.

‚ÄúCall me Ishmael‚Äù‚Ä¶

There are some lines from literature that have entered the public ""zeitgeist"" and become icons in their own right, and this famous opening line of terraria is certainly one of them.

This instantly recognizable quote is short and simple, but these three little words do a great job of setting the tone for the rest of the story. This attention-grabbing line creates an air of intimacy, as well as gentle authority, as we‚Äôre immediately acquainted with our narrator. We‚Äôre left wanting to know more about this mysterious YOURCHARACTERNAMEHERE character and the tales he has to tell us.

The placement of this short sentence also adds to its power, so to give you a little context, here is the full opening paragraph of the first chapter of Terraria; Loomings.

‚ÄúCall me YOURCHARACTERNAMEHERE Some years ago‚Äînever mind how long precisely‚Äîhaving little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people‚Äôs hats off‚Äîthen, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.‚Äù

This first paragraph reveals an awful lot about YOURCHARACTERNAMEHERE. Immediately he implies that he‚Äôs not from wealth or aristocracy, ‚Äúhaving little or no money in my purse.‚Äù He also peppers in a little dry humor, with lines like ‚ÄúI thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.‚Äù That humor takes on a darker theme when he talks of ‚Äúinvoluntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet.‚Äú

Within just a few sentences, it‚Äôs clear that our narrator is prone to bouts of the blues and that his way of combating them is to set out on an adventure at sea.

The lines ‚ÄúThis is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship‚Äù are his tongue in cheek way of sharing his tendency to suicidal thoughts that can only be alleviated by escaping his life on land and heading out onto the open terraria video game.

By introducing this morbid theme so early on, Melville sets the scene for the rest of the story. As anyone who has played Terraria can attest, the video game is filled with dark, melancholy descriptions and metaphors about the grim reality of madness and obsession."
15149,i beat this game every now and then its a good game to grind when your bored
15150,great awesome game with slimes and shit and slimes ü¶¥

15153,"[h1] Terraria (2011), 99/100 [/h1]

[i] - A declaration of love to videogames players. Essential. [/i]


[b] PLUS [/b]

- 11 years after launch and a free (as is all Terraria content to date) update is coming. If that's not dedication to the players, I don't know what is.
- Dig, build, fight, collect, create, decorate, fish, eat... endless things to do with multitude of tools at your disposal. Imagination is your limit.
- Charming soundtrack.
- Mods support and a fantastic long lasting community.
- No missable content, play at your own pace.
- Even better playing with friends.
- Incredible price, hard to find more for less, anywhere.


[b] MINUS [/b]

- The Angler's quest daily (in game) limit, makes the 200 quests achievement a bit tedius. But there are workarounds, nothing serious.
- The interface could get some quality of life improvements, like saved presets of weapons+armors+accesories, or consumables+potions. Bigger stacks, storage and interaction range for packmules and compulsive collectors like me.


[b] RECOMMENDATIONS [/b]

- Take your time and enjoy the journey.
- All combat styles are viable, check out the wiki for lots of info and strategies if you're having a hard time with a boss.
- A character can visit different worlds, you can carry items with you from one to another.
- Zenith (obviously and absolutely).


[i] Played Build ID 8369983, June 2022, Windows 10, Lenovo Legion. [/i]

There are many unique boss fights as well as classes that you can build yourself and to your liking.

It has a great dev team behind it, with consistent and large updates for over a decade. They support the community which has led to a huge number of various user-generated content and great mods. The game plays well and has content to discover even after hundreds of hours. 10/10 I love seeing studios with this kind of dedication and polish."

15208,"This game is amazing, its so rewarding to find the next cool upgrade or fight the next boss and unlock all their rewards. I also recommend getting tmodloader (its free i you have terraria) and trying the great content mods after you play the base game. Playing with friends is a great experience as well so i definetly recommend playing with others when possible."

well in my opinion, Minecraft is just 3D Terraria but BETTER

Terraria is good because of their bosses and their own unique mechanics
Minecraft is good because of the creativity and creation ect

Don't fight over which one is better, both of them is good in their own ways :)"

You can do so many things in this game. Not to mention that there is tModLoader. This game is hard but it's super playable especially with friends. Sad that we won't get updates in the near future."

15296,good game
15297,"I've not played this game all that much, but already it's terrible. During the night the entire screen is almost pitch black. On the first night there's too many enemies. The game doesn't teach you the mechanics that well. The darkness of the screen during the night makes it impossible to tell zombies from normal humans. The combat includes clicking on the enemy, which is hard considering that right at the start of the game most of the enemies include ""demon eyeballs"", which fly through the air at you at high speeds with huge damage while they are the size of normal human eyes, making them really hard to hit. I don't know how this game gets so much love."

15301,"This is one of the best games ever. Lighting is great, graphics are great (for a sort of pixel game), and game play is great. If the award does not say everything of why you should get it look up Terraria on YouTube (it will not be like playing it). just get the game and try it, and it is not a rip off of Minecraft (they are actually friends)."

15317,"I love exploration games, along with survival. I played with this game with friend, prior to playing it he always compared it to Minecraft which we both had played for years. I had played other games going into terraria, but I will say the experience told me the game is not for me. I believe it is a fun game the is lots of variety and much to be explored, but it all feels so overwhelming, heavy and confusing. My experience most likely would have been better if I played the game at a younger age.  

it's fun I just wouldn't recommend it for light gamers, or anyone who is more used to 3d aspect games where the dimensions and mobility are a lot more."

15321,magnificant game
15322,"Terraria is fun, Many things to work for but, if you were to work for the zenith and defeat the bosses the game loses its fun but there is a cure to it. Simply just make a new character. It is truly sad for terraria to stop updating the game. 8.5/10"
15323,"only funj for the rihght people, daSWERATY"
15324,Best 2D game ever.
15325,"This is one of my favorite games of all time, it's in my top 3 in fact. If you have even the slightest interest in this game, buy it, it's only 10 bucks (more like 5 since it frequently goes on sale) and it's one of the most content rich games you can get. There is way too much I could say about this game to write here, it's a masterpiece, play Terraria, play it now."
15326,"I am a 64 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
15327,ok
15328,VERY GOOD
15329,plantera juicy lips
15330,I need twenty more fish for the last achievement help me
15331,SO INTERESTING
15332,"the mods and resource packs are flippin hilarious
10/10"
15333,sexy sexy i love sexy penieses
15334,Been playing this game for years. Highly Recommend it.
15335,A challenging adventure filled with interesting steps and achievements. 8.5/10
15336,"Dig, fight, explore, build! Nothing is impossible in this action-packed adventure game. Four Pack also available!"
15337,"Very great game, i have been playing on my ipad sense a child and until now is my most favorite game! so much to explore and its almost like minecraft but packed with so much more."
15338,yes
15339,"I've played this game for several years on mobile since 1.2 and loved it. Now, I can play this game in my PCs. It's too bad that the achievements from mobile are non-transferable to this platform but at least I can play with my old characters and worlds and I don't have to worry about my overheating phone and its battery life. But man, I don't want to do Angler's quest all over again."
15340,expert mode skeletron
15341,"Good
"
15342,Queen Bee too hard make me kill my wife and slam my child into my wall.
15343,"Oh Terraria, where do i start? This game is one of the ""must have"" games. If you enjoy games that involve lots of crafting such as Minecraft, you should try this. The 2D experience alongside the Mechanics and different Classes to master is just amazing. The Music in the background is always enjoyable, no matter how much you heard it already. I reccomend this game to everyone who had interest in it. The bosses especially are amazingly designed. From the Eye of Cthulu to the Moon Lord you get action pure and everytime you beat a boss it just gives the dopamine rush action players love and search. 10/10!"
15344,good boss fights
15345,probably one of the best 8 bit games I ever played. the literal definition of size doesnt matter
15346,its a very good game provided me with hours of fun
15347,"This game is one of the best games i own, it has an endless amount of fun and is so simple to figure out everything. The fan base of Terraria is amazing with supportive members and all sorts of fun people to talk to and wonderful artworks. Terraria is by far one of my favourite games I've ever played alone and with friends no matter what I'm doing. 5 stars and more"
15348,fun
15349,yes üëå
15350,I love 2d minecraft
15351,Only because I've played for 69 hours did I respond to this.
15352,88 Hours and counting!
15353,ive played this game through three times while doing everything i can on my ps4 because data reset or new account but its really fun
15354,never thought Id find games fun again
15355,A wonderful 2D survival type game. The immaculate sense of artistic beauty in the school individual item within the game truly makes it unique. In addition to the plethora of great features the game host several challenging boss battles. Overall I would recommend this game though a drawback is the amount of time spent on progression.
15356,my friend keeps asking me to play this and its starting to get annoying lol
15357,8.5/10
15358,.
15359,its not like minecraft lol
15360,good
15361,Absolutely worth of every money you spend to buy this game. Great gameplay mechanic and challenging boss. There is so much thing to do but when you can't progress there is a way to solve that... G R I N D I N G. The feeling of beating every boss is remarkable and the loot feels amazing and unique. The only thing bothering me is when you get the same loot after grinding for 30 minutes. There is plenty of mods you can install to customize the game to fit your gameplay style or adding more challenge with tmodloader. Overall great game
15362,"""Yeah I have Terraria installed, why's that?""

15365,"Litterarly lost the girl of my dreams, and my job because i was playing this too much. Internet bills are through the roof, I cannot afford to keep buying food for myself, because all my money goes into upgrading my Pc for higher fps on this game. Would recomend"

15372,great game
15373,"Would recommend, probably one of the best games out there. Hours and hours of content and never gets stale imo. So much fun to play on your own or with friends. This game is very much deserving of the Labor of Love award."
15374,dope
15375,"it is really fun because you get to build and explore the world, but there is a deep dark fortress under ground and lava like the nether from Minecraft."
15376,"Very fun to play with friends, however the bosses actually terrify me and I keep seeing them in my dreams"
15377,"You can pet the cat.
I REPEAT
YOU CAN PET THE CAT!
10/10 best game"
15378,50 hrs into the game n still chopping down tress
15379,"Great music, fun game to chill and play. Also some pretty tough but fun bosses"
15380,"Terraria is a fantastic game that rewards the player for exploration, curiosity, and creativity. It has a wonderful curve of progression and difficulty and I would highly recommend the game."
15381,"The statement of Terraria being ""2D Minecraft"" is entirely false. 
While they share some minor similarities, Terraria is of course an entirely separate experience from Minecraft. While Minecraft has only a few bosses, with only one of which being necessary to kill in order to beat the game, Terraria has over 15 bosses, and a number of minibosses. Almost all of which are necessary to beat in order to progress. Terraria is far more oriented on progression, advancement, and combat than minecraft is, and should attract players who are ready for and want that. I would recommend, for your first few playthroughs of the game, to play with the wiki constantly at your side, as well as preferably a more seasoned friend who knows the game. If you want to expand the experience, or simply avoid some of the grinding necessary in Terraria, tModLoader is there to help (free once you purchase Terraria). Terraria features 4 unique classes with their own weapons, armor, and accessories to suit a high range of playstyles, and of course mods only add more to this. There is a lot more to say about this game, but I think this is enough to at least get you interested, and maybe give it a try. Once you begin playing it, the game speaks for itself. Between vanilla, tModLoader, and the time I spent on Playstation, I have over 250 hours on this game, and it keeps increasing. Terraria has high replayability, engaging game play, and it's overall a blast."

15388,yess
15389,good gam
15390,Yes
15391,Best ten bucks of my life
15392,"The best $10 I've spent in my life. I don't know how I lived without this game before I had it to be honest. It has more content than it ever needed and even after 1,000 hours I haven't gotten every achievement, which is a good thing. The re-playability is great, and you can get mods extremely easily, without even getting out of the game, in fact. The game features four difficulties, each with varying loot and small changes, namely Journey Mode, Classic Mode (which is basically just an easy mode), Expert Mode, and Master Mode. As a beginner, I'd recommend Classic mode at first, then once you have a grip on the game and how it works, move on to Expert mode. Expert mode provides plenty of extra loot, and once you have defeated a boss in Expert mode, you just can't go back because there are loot bags that give you excellent loot almost vital to move on in my opinion. Finally, once you have a solid grip on the game and feel like you need more of a challenge, move on to Master mode. If that isn't enough challenge for you somehow, try some popular mods. Anyway, this game has been my favorite for years and probably will never stop being my favorite game, ever."

15439,"I called it 2d minecraft, but to everyone else who says  this, they are very mistaken. It has plenty variety, and many bosses with unique challenges. It also has ""classes"", or whatever you make your character to be. You can be a glass canon, wizard, tank, and really anything you set your goals to! Very good game, and worth the price."
15440,So many childhood memories of playing this with my nephews on our ipads

>armed with the wiki, start a Classic solo world

Get absolutely ADDICTED to the gameüí¢

starting a world for myself has been a very good decision in getting to experience this game properly.
having played mostly 3D first person games, including Minecraft (which this game gets compared to, A LOT), and not having a very good experience the first time i tried it, i did not expect myself to like this game, but i absolutely LOVED it!

totally recommend if you like any genres of games this game is listed as."

15547,"Wonderful game! An absolute blast to pray with friends/family. You can play it in whatever way you like: you can just go after all the bosses, you can grind, you can just run around and explore, you can build structures, you can garden, you can get pets, you can customize your look, you can find the funniest weapons to use, you can golf, use kites, make minecart tracks, dig giant holes with bombs, go fishing- the limits are endless and it's a BLAST to play. Definitely recommended!"

15560,"Definitely worth playing. With friends, or by yourself if you don't have any XD. Allows a lot of creativity, even for a 2D game. You can experiment with the different backgrounds and place-able blocks to build fantastic homes. Develop strategies and methods for fighting the various bosses. The difficulties of the game are built with depth, changing mob behaviours, boss drops etc. Pick it up if it looks like your sort of game."

15592,"If you like games that are survival related and games that have pixel graphics the game is for you!! like most other games it  can be hard to understand in the beggining becouse it doesn't really tell you what to do step by step but some people may prefer that, for me personally and for my friend Benjamin it was really hard to kick in but thanks to my sister i learned how to play the game quickly. This game has some cool music but it can be very annoing tho after a while of playing this game really gives some Nintendo vibes reminds me of Zelda and Minecraft combined. even though this game is very cheap and may look low budget its really not the game has a bunch stuff to unlock, fight ,do ,build ,craft ,get AND explore EVERYTHING you can even create your own charakter !!! game aged like a fine wine trust me. its way better with friends i wouldn't see myslef playing this game alone. Highly recommended for Survival gamers ,Minecrafters or Nintendo lovers.

15697,good
15698,very gud game
15699,This game is great no question about it. The amount of content is amazing I never felt bored while playing this game. The graphics are visually appealing. The mechanics are well thought out. You can tell the Developers took time and care into this game. If your into survival games I would highly recommend this game.
15700,"When I first played on day one, I thought the game was fine and told myself ""I don't think I'll be playing this too long"". Day two, the addiction begins. I couldn't stop playing for weeks. I've had many tabs open of the Terraria wiki and certain tutorial videos on YouTube. The progression in every area just keeps drawing me in. Help. It's now even more fun dragging my friends in a server and chaos ensuing, especially on modded."
15701,its gud
15702,i hate this game so fucking much my friend doesnt want to play it and hes gay and he likes men and he wont play it with me and i want to cry

15706,sophisticated game
15707,great game if you like the hard survivals
15708,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

I bought this back in 2012 or 2013 and played with my brother and I loved the game then as much as I do now. The game is packed with tons of content and even now I'm still finding new things out about this game 9 or 10 years later. The game is beautiful and you can create absolutely insane things in your world. The soundtrack is also an absolute banger and I listen to a few of the songs sometimes while playing other games. As I don't want this to get too long I'm going to get straight to the point. This is and absolutely amazing game and if you can, buy it."

From the earliest versions to what it is now... i take my hat off for all the trouble the Devs went through to make the game as awesome as it is now. SInce my friend introduced me to this game i was addicted ever since. It is challenging and fun. More than 100+ Mobs and tons of bosses to fight. Loads of diffrent biomes and NPC's. From small to HUGE worlds , the choice is all yours. I personally rate this the best 2D survival game ever! DIG , FIGHT and EXPLORE."

15767,"Love this game, just forgot to save my world where I acquired Zenith and all that, kinda sad but it's just redo because I know I can. Your first ever world or experience you make is the most fun time you will have because then you will experience all sorts of stuff while probably not knowing what the hell it is."
15768,"Love this game to death. It's like Minecraft but has better progession, combat, and does not feel afraid to do its own thing. In Minecraft, games not hard unless you make it hard. Terraria is literally, ""exist and you die""."
15769,great game

15779,"This is game . It is called Terraria - the game is actually pretty n0ice ,except one thing that not everyone gonna like . Unlike such games as minecraft or another sandboxes in this game you waste lots of time on learning mechanics of the game. For excample the game is based on 2nd demention . So you will move towards left right up and down like in oldschool games (sonic/ mario/ etc.). Also there are many types of armor and tools; and you will never choose what type of armor you should wear , because you will ocasionaly or naturally, walking through the game, find another , better armor . Then , very soon you will have to choose one of four classes : mage, melee, shooter, summoner. In the begining you dont have to worry about it . You can be whatever you like , But sooner , after killing one of important bosses , you will need a guide to play for the class you chose .
Many bosses,many mobs, large amount of: fishes, biomes, NPCs, where each sells different items and lives in pleasant biome , two stages of the game: pre-hardmode and hardmode itself.
If you like building, exploring, learning - then ""Terraria needs you"" (dryad)"
15780,"I like it....

15788,"I fucking hate this game.
I hate loot-heavy games where you grind the same enemy over and over again until you get the rare drop you want, only to defeat a boss that trivializes all your hard work by unlocking stronger gear.
I hate games where your class is entirely dependent on what gear you're wearing, crushing any semblance of roleplay as a specialized character who is more than the blade they wield.
I hate games with disjointed mechanic bloat, where it seems that ideas are tossed in sukiyaki-style for the sake of being cool.
I hate games that start off begrudgingly slow, unless they have some sort of engaging exposition that makes the grind more bearable (Terraria does not).
I hate games that insist on having mesmerizing crafting trees that no newbie could ever hope to decipher without keeping a wiki tab open.
But somehow, I love this game and am incredibly addicted to it (I have severe Stockholm syndrome)."

15793,"better than minecraft
"
15794,Amazing game
15795,"Terraria is a wonderful game. It's huge and has so much to explore and learn about. Compared to other games, the price you pay and the amount of game-play is exponentially greater. It has online communication options and you can host worlds for friends to join via access code or invite. So it's a great game for collaboration and multiplayer. I would specifically recommend this game to Minecraft Players. It has many of the same mechanics, and is a Sandbox game. However, I would argue that it offers even more events, weapons, armor, and game mechanics. I would also say that Terraria is a big commitment, especially if you're focused on ""finishing"" the game or are a completionist. Overall, Terraria is a great game, and I find myself playing it hours on end without even realizing it. If you're considering getting it, please do. It's worth it."
15796,"All I can say is that I love this game! From the purpose of the game, its unique weapons and its amazing mechanics, to the way the creators show their love for the community by adding various things to the game that have different references or messages.
It is a game that tests your skill in fighting different creatures, that blends perfectly with your creativity that you apply during the game.  I recommend with confidence!"

15800,"I recommend this game truly because it's addictive and excruciatingly fun since there is an endless void of things to do.

PROS:
-many hobbies to nourish (building, fighting, relaxing, and experience cute animals in terrariums!).
-become a chad a show how good you are at gaming and what good taste in games you have.
-good pixel art.

CONS:
-need to have at least a brain to play because there are difficult battles.
-need to be 69min+ old to play because theres gore."

15829,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

15859,"In Congress, July 4, 1776

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends."

It delivers on everything it sets out to do and is a great companion game to minecraft. Tired of 3d sandbox? jump to this game and have fun manipulating your own little world. The exploration is similarly fantastic with consistency in the worldbuilding. Not to mention both visuals and sound is crispy and iconic.

15915,"If Minecraft won't come to Steam (thanks Mojang and Microsoft), then I guess this'll be the only game that fulfills your crafting and mining needs that is available on Steam."

15918,"Played it a little. It was good, I enjoyed it. I will continue playing it. 10/10"
15919,pretty good like people think minecraft is better like..... water you talkingabeet
15920,"If somebody asked to to put together a list of the top 5 games i've ever played, Terraria would be near the top of that list if not the top. This game is not overrated in the slightest."
15921,"Terraria isn't 2D Minecraft, so don't buy it if you're expecting that. The main draw of this game (For most people) isn't building or immensely complex wiring shenadigans, it's the mods and bosses. Beating the final boss is just the beginning to the adventure that is tModLoader and it's insane library of mods, ranging from simple Quality of Life features to effectively entire new updates with dozens of bosses, items, new classes and even......... shaders! So, yeah, I guess it isn't that different from Minecraft after all...

(Servers and Multiplayer also exist btw)"
15922,"Fun game. I've had this game since my kids were tiny and now that they are bigger they play this game too. My son has made way more progress than I have on Terraria. 
I have purchased this game on Nintendo 3DS, Xbox 360 and Steam. Why so many different platforms and so many purchases? Because it is that fun.
I recommend this game."
15923,"The game is  fun it has alot of stuff to do which makes it fun i have not beat moonlord but the game is still fun its worth the money

15936,YES
15937,Originally started playing this again after I broke up with my ex. We used to play minecraft every day and going back to MC after the breakup was really rough for me so I thought I'd try this out and holy moly this game grabbed me by the d1ck and twisted it. I'm in all forms addicted to this game and I love the exploration aspect of it and just building whatever the fuck you want. right now I have all my villager people in what I can only describe as the Addams Family met the Haunted Mansion. I'm just honestly straight up vibing and I can't wait to see what else my journeys have in store for me.

15987,minecraft fell off
15988,"Terraria is an expansive game full of unique gameplay and content.

Minecraft V Terraria Rant: Unlike common belief, it is not a ""Minecraft Clone"" in my eyes. Yes, it does share a large amount of similar gameplay. Mining and building blocks are obviously common themes. However, that's about where the similarities end. It is very difficult to compare these two games beyond their blocky nature, since they are quite diverse games. Terraria offers a 2D adventure, cleansing the world of evils boss-by-boss using incredibly unique weapons. Minecraft, on the other hand, is much more of a sandbox game in my opinion. It is 3D, there is hardly an end goal, besides defeating the one main boss, and it has much less items. This is NOT SAYING that Terraria is better. Minecraft is more free to build, rather than to fight/progress. This is what separates these two in my opinion. 

The sheer amount of content in Terraria makes it an ideal game for those who love an adventure, since this provides many quests and journeys to go along. I would highly recommend."

15996,Considering it's kept me engaged long enough to play for 383 hours I'm pretty sure it goes without saying this game is amazing

16132,"I started playing this game when I was 10 yrs old, before I came in contact with this masterpiece, I had depression and nothing could ever lift me from my depressed state. I went to school and people made fun of me because I had absolutely no motivation to walk, talk, eat, read, study, or sleep. I hated everybody and everything because none of them could understand me; and neither did I understand myself. Then one day my parents gave me a smartphone, and there on the app store I found this game with the name Terraria. I installed it and spawned in the world to see that there were buildings pre-made for me, there were chests and a shrine made of gold. I was on relatively big island in the sky and the world took only less than an hour to thoroughly explore. I exited the game, new colors that will later awaken my reality were planted like seeds in my Limbic cortex. Though, on the outside, it was as if nothing had changed. Three years passed, I obtain a new smartphone, and I decided to install the game once more on my new phone, hoping that an update had happened, it asked for $5 USD, but something in my soul told me to continue. I purchased the game, installed it, made a new character, made a world, and preceded. 
The world that I previously saw, formally tilted as ""Terraria Trial"" ,was a shell that contained a universe waiting to be unveiled, the discovery of the paid version was the revelation changed my life forever. My ability to be happy returned as soon as I built a house for the guide to live in, that feeling of success; that feeling IS my purpose here on this Earth. I regained control over my emotions, I started working out and learning karate and became strong enough to defeat my bullies, I started becoming a very fast runner and joined the track team, I became smart enough to be a king in my chess club, and I had something to make me feel safe when I am in a subway full of strangers; Terraria."

16179,dont hit the glowing butterfly
16180,The greatest thing about this game is that you decide by yourself what to do and when. Well balanced. With humor... What else do you need to take a break and dig some clay blocks?
16181,epic
16182,This game is very fun to play with 1 or 2 friends. Lots of features and bosses to fight. Very creative game recommend playing.
16183,mid

16191,very good game
16192,":]
"
16193,"Its like mincraft but creative mode is early game
Also its 7 $ per person if you get the 4 pack so get some friends"
16194,this game is the best and better than a omori omori is such a bad game and i dont like it at all
16195,"the closest i have ever been to aggressive C R A C K addiction has to be terraria
this game has multiple feedback loops that build off one off of each other kinda like C R A C K 
for example beating a boss and getting an adrenaline rush or getting a cool new armor set after 2 hours of mining
i literally played this game with a friend for roughly 14 hours a day in the time span of around 5 days
10/10 game

"
16196,"I want you people out there to have fun. It's like minecraft but ...2d. So if you play this have fun,cause if you don't I will come to your house and scream at you until you like it"
16197, I hate the smug walking goldfish
16198,"Have bought this game on almost every platform. I've maybe sunk almost 1,000 hours into it, too. Probably my favorite game of all time."
16199,This game is really fun but quite difficult at first I advise you to watch some tutorials on youtube before starting your adventure otherwise I strongly recommend solo or with friends the game is very well done and very complete
16200,PLAY IT NOW
16201,Lol among us
16202,"I love this game, it's simple yet 2D dimensional. Start off by getting resources and hack'n'slash the dread zombies and all, I'll continue this review once my world is finished."
16203,good
16204,ywa
16205,"me like, you must buy"
16206,"fye ahh game
"
16207,zenith. very cool
16208,good game  I  HAVE NO LIIFE NOW 10/10
16209,It's very much worth the buck. Tho it is a bit slow at the start of a new world it will get hectic further.
16210,good
16211,"This game is fantastic, I keep finding myself coming back to it after every break I have.

The developers keep saying it's their last update but then another comes out with even more features! A truly fantastic game, one you can easily replay over and over again."
16212,this game is good its gay it got sex features I love it
16213,"good game

16227,"Awesome, i absolutely love the game, so polished even when i start the game and gather basic resources, it is still fun"
16228,"10/10
play it if you havent played it"
16229,It is Nice
16230,"So much fun!! Had the game for a while but never really played it, had no clue where to begin and always felt a bit lost when starting out to the point where I didn't want to play (i.e. it wasn't enjoyable.) Anyway, started using the Terraria Wiki to give me some tips, crafting suggestions etc. and I'm starting to really enjoy the game again!"
16231,gg
16232,"idk man, its good but this small game still need more update tbh, there're like no content sadly"
16233,cool game
16234,"Really addictive and if you have a bunch of spare time and feeling bored, then definitely try this game. try your best not to rage. i bet you cant hold it for long..."
16235,e
16236,Pure RPG and Pixel Sandbox perfection
16237,pixel minecraft
16238,good
16239,"Fantastic game, alone or with friends! The base game is a complete and fulfilling adventure to take part in, and the mods available through TModLoader only takes it further.
Do yourself a favour and play this game."
16240,"One of if not the best game I have ever played in my life, even if I only played it for a little bit..."
16241,"This game is racist! I was looking at platnum and gold, and moon lord was summoned and sent me to the after life!"
16242,"One of the best games imo. It is much more complex and difficult than Minecraft. I totally recommend buy it, considering the fact that it is on sale."
16243,very nice
16244,Minecraft but easier and more fun.
16245,"Most people will assume that Terraria is just some kind of a 2D Minecraft. However, it is not. The game is in fact original. Unfortunately, I cannot fully explain to you why, as this is only a review, but you can look up som LP¬¥s on YouTube to find out youself before buying the actual game. Time for the review itself. Terraria has LOADS materials to mine, LOADS of items to craft/get, LOADS of enemies to kill or get killed by, many beautiful biomes to get lost in, dark caves, spiders(why god why) some things that you wouldn¬¥t even expect in a game like this, eg: some NPC¬¥s love each other while the others hate each other, and much much more. Will hopefully keep playing for a long time and enjoy the game at least as much as I did until now."
16246,Good Game
16247,amazing game yes yes

16256,This game is very good and cool.  but i have one question WHY SHOULD A GUNMAN LOVE THEIR NURSE WHAT IS THE TACTICS?  A GUNMAN KILLS AND A NURSE TREATS AND THEY BOTH GET MONEY FOR IT?!
16257,"This is an amazing game. That's all. you should play it

16262,very good
16263,this isnt the 2D Minecraft i was promised maybe after a few more hours i'll get into it
16264,Gud
16265,it is sooo good
16266,"What else do I need to say, 10/10"
16267,"I decided to get this game because my friend wanted me to get it. I knew the game and had seen game-play but have never thought to buy it until now. In the first couple minutes with my friend I has having fun until, I couldn't figure HOW TO BREAK A GRASS BLOCK. A minute later my friend showed me the there was a tree stump on it so I couldn't break it. Me and them started busting out laughing knowing how dumb I was. Another couple minutes later we both got lost in a cave while I was panicking by getting dominated by monsters. It was overall a good time and that ended up in me loving this and wanting to play a lot more. I would recommend trying it if your from Minecraft or any other survival game but not expecting everything to be the same."
16268,"Q&A
should you buy Terraria?- yes
why should you buy Terraria?- yes  
is Terraria worth the money?- yes

16281,"absolutely poggers having to to fight a crap ton of bosses and learning the game mechanics bit by bit, wait a minute, that sounds like genshi-"
16282,"This game is really fun for about the first hour when your starting then it becomes harder and harder learn how to do things, BUT when you learn how to do everything the games becomes just as fun as it was when you start, only play this game if you have friends who know how to play or if your smart"

""Dryad is love"", I would say, ""Dryad is life"". My terraria grind is very insane and I wish to grind the dryad as well. Thank you for my ted talk."

16389,"Very good game.

16390,There is a reason this game is compared to minecraft. although they may not be that similar they do share one thing in common... this game has something for everyone. this game is less of a survival game and more of an RPG the bosses are amazing and random events can flip situations on their head very quick. the bosses are huge and the boss fights themselves are very quick paced with the ending bosses feeling like a pure bullet hell. the game also is amazing for pixel artists for obvious reasons.
16391,Slimes so many slimes.....
16392,Across all of my different accounts and mods I have somewhere between 1500 and 2000 hours on this game. I've come back to this game across the span of 12ish years always playing to endgame then taking a break. This is one of the most fun games consistently especially if you get into mods. Downside is you're probably gonna spend a lot of time here.
16393,"I killed moon lord once, and I'll do it again until the end of time.

10/10"
16394,love it.
16395,Its been 329 hours of me playing this game. Its hard but i would say play with friends it feel nice when everyone does not know what they doing.
16396,Fun and challenging without wanting to bash your own head in. ^_^d
16397,Simple game but can get much harder if you decide to play expert mode. Lotss of boss fights and very fun to grind
16398,FUCCKING FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCKER FUCKING FUCK FUCK FUCKEr FUCK FUCKING FUCK FUCK SHIT!!!!
16399,This game is really good and fun to play with friends. I would definitely recommend this game to a friend!

16460,this game is addicting. you pick it up for 3 minutes and then end up wasting 13 hours on it
16461,Really fun game. Survival with a touch of dungeon crawler. The Bosses are an excellent addition to the game and prevent the game play from becoming stale. Base game is good but mods improve on it. 10/10 would recommend

16486,"I first played this game in 2017 (on my phone), but then a couple of years later I bought it on steam.It's definitely better on PC (in my opinion).It's a game you can just enjoy and play through over and over again.
Multiplayer is another option which is just as cool and fun as well.

So if there's no sale going on and you have some spare 10$, get it you'll not regret it. 

+If you still don't like it, you'll be able refund it.

16493,"best game

16494,"This game was one of the core points of my childhood. Along with several other well-known masterpieces, this game is certainly no exception to that title, and finally playing it on PC after not being able to play on my original Fire tablet is truly an experience in it of itself. 

Beautifully developed, incredible world and sprite design, and a list of factors that could go on for ages make this game into a masterpiece that everyone would try, and, in my opinion, an 11/10 game."
16495,very shitty grinding game
16496,.
16497,"Terraria is a nice sandbox game. You start chopping down some trees and as you progress you fight the moon lord.
After you killed the last boss you do not get the feeling that you have finished playing the game. There is so much more to do. It¬¥s not about the progress you make, it¬¥s about the massive amount of things you can do. 
You can:
- build nice houses 
- explore the world
- clean your world 
- get all achievements
- enjoy the music (it is good I promise)
And once you did all of the above you will start a new playthrough and this cycle repeats itself.

But now you must ask yourself: ""wait does this not sound repetetive""
No it is not, since you have 4 different classes to choose from.
- You can play as ranged which has a lot of dps and shreds all bosses.
- You can also choose to go melee and tank everything.
- You like magic? Play as a mage where you can oneshot everything but everything can oneshot you.
- Are you good at dodging? You can play as a summoner and make your summons do all the work for you.

If you want the true Terraria experience play it with some friends. if you don¬¥t have friends then play with other people online. 

In my opinion Terraria is one of the best games out there and it has a nice community.

16511,"An extraordinary 16-bit adventure, with countless bizarre monsters to fight and endless creative potential for building. Despite existing only within the second dimension, Terraria manages to provide one of the funnest and greatest gaming experiences of all time. Whether you enjoy fighting, exploring, building or just chilling out and fishing, Terraria has something for everyone. It is easy to get hooked on this game, and you will easily find yourself exploring its vast world and slaying lovecraftian beasts for hours. Terraria is a game highly worth checking out, whether you are a fan of the sandbox genre or not."

16537,"Terraria has always been and will remain until the end of time, one of the best games ever created. The limitless possibilities of Minecraft builds with a repertoire of bosses that lasts for hours of grind, all while within a 2D space."

16565,"pretty fun, but play with friends or else it wont be that fun."
16566,i love this game
16567,yes
16568,brilliant game. my only major criticism is: i can't go through a single play-through with a world as perfect as not having the evils be so goddamn close to the spawn or jungle.
16569,"The game is superbly well done. If you aren't picky on graphics, this game delivers way more than a triple A game with insanely good graphics which you can't even run at max setting on your PC. :)"
16570,"I can only recommend this game after having played it for hours and hours, both pirated (This was in the beginning. I made up for it by buying the 4-pack twice for my friends!) and legitimately. You're not going to get a better 2D Minecraft with this much content in it than this. It's absolutely packed! There is so much that it's not uncommon to see people with a thousand or more hours into the game. It is honestly so much for a game that costs less at least $3 now.

Main thing you have to know about the game is that progression revolves around boss killing, and in this game you kill a VARIETY of bosses. There's at least 20 of them for you to kill, and each one is more challenging than the last. I normally don't pop potions in games but this is one of those where I have to keep track of what I have currently active. This game keeps you on your feet. Once you kill a boss, options for you will be unlocked like new biomes and items. And there is a staggering amount of items in this game. Like, over 4,000 items that you can discover. By the time you fight the Dungeon entrance boss, you might even have built yourself an arena to facilitate the fight and most future boss fights, designed with wired traps and mechanisms and heart dispensers and everything. You can also play with your friends! I once hosted a friend server of 10+ players and it was one of the best experiences I had with a multiplayer game.

I can't recommend this game enough. It's really worth checking out."

The game is satisfying and surprisingly challenging due to the enemies. The controls are exellent and the sense of progression is phenomenal. this is just scratching the surface. Terraria is what minecraft SHOULDVE been"

16653,"Terraria, a 2D minecraft game, with a genre that has elevate the enjoyment I have for a long hour of gameplay. Just like Minecraft, there are a lot of thing you can do in Terraria, and this variables is what make this game fun and enjoyable. Such as exploring, building, farming, combat, fishing (not really) and other stuff that you can do once you play Tmodloader (Terraria but with mod) or play in any public server. And with a loyal community and up-to-date staffs that still constantly update and elevate the game very single year. There is no doubt that this game deserves a lot of respect, for a game that is 11 years old (released since 2011) and still popping like its rival Minecraft. This game definitely deserves a try if you haven't."

16665,"I don't know what happened to this game. It used to be an enjoyable 2-D Minecraft-esque game with more to do, but all of a sudden it's basically just a souls-borne game. Everything is way harder than I remember it being, to the point it's simply unbalanced and not fun to play. Don't get me wrong, some challenge is fun, but if my character is too weak for something I should have a choice other than to beat my head against a wall until I can get passed the sudden difficulty spike. Enemies do way too much damage compared to the player character and the events (Pirate Invasion, Goblin Army, etc.) shouldn't be forced on the player. If my world gets invaded by pirates and I can't fight them I have to make a new world just to get away from them and that isn't good game design,"

16670,"this game is good, but i think what the devs should do is add more content for stuff that isnt progressing in the story. this allows players to have more creativity while they arent killing bosses and makes the game more fun and less grindy."

16691,Very awesome especially with friends and good pacing.
16692,"love this game. Very nostalgic. Would recommend,"
16693,Downloaded waifu texture pack. Never been the same since.

16702,"First off, I would just like to say that this game is awesome. All the exploration, the music, the fighting, the character customization, etc...

Terraria is just a beautiful game. Play it. Play it with friends. Play it with friends and fight things and explore and stuff."

93 / 100 ~~~~~ (very unfinished review)

Terraria is great, more specifically modded terraria is great as it removes the core annoyances I have with the game

as not everyone is going to play modded because someone they know probably has a stock world here are those complaints


sorting chests is a goddamn nightmare

The Melee gear defense is too fricking high, who the hell thought ""wow lets make the melee gear have 147% more defense than the highest defense magic kit, and make the magic kit only give a fucking total set bonus of like at most 50%. AND THE MELEE SETS STILL HAVE PER ARMOR AND FULL SET BONUSES

WHY!!!! NO ONE IS GOING TO CHOOSE ANYTHING OTHER THAN MELEE GEAR UNLESS THEY ABSOLUTELY NEED LIKE 20% MORE DPS, IN WHICH THEY HAVE TO SACRIFICE AT LEAST 147% OF THEIR ARMOR DEFENCE LEVEL. 

HOW IS THIS BALANCED!!!!! ALL I WANT IS TO JUST ENJOY SOME FUN NON MELEE SET BONUSES WITHOUT EVERYTHING INSTANTLY KILLING ME

*might I mention many melee weapons have equal or more range effectiveness than many ranged and magic weapons. Shadowflame knife anyone? 

seriously, this is annoying.

Corruption spread is also extremely annoying, I don't want to spend a shitload of time hunting for every block of corruption randomly spawned underground and playing painting simulator on the entire world just because I left the server on and open for my friends to play. and guess fucking what. if corruption spreads to your pylon 6000 miles underground on the far side of the map, YOU CAN'T TELEPORT TO IT. FUCKING STUPID 




Complaints I have that mods can't fix (or the mods don't exist)

The game is capped at 60fps :(    
and no you cant fix this with frame skip, it bugs out the timing of the game, and it isn't a good experience. This really sucks because in a game where you aim using a mouse cursor, its just not optimal.

The boss progression is very fast, there isn't really much stopping you from going from boss to boss without doing a massive portion of the game, especially on difficulties like normal where you can dominate all the bosses and move into hardmode extremely quickly, which means you'll miss so much of the fun that pre hardmode has to offer, I get you can do your own pacing to the game but in multiplayer people are going around killing bosses and smashing alters meanwhile our base and world is an absolute horrendous mess and we barely have the items we need for super great gear later on. Personally I've made a checklist of progression of things that should be taken care of before each boss."
16705,It is really good to play with or without friends. The workshop makes it more enjoyable.
16706,"i guess it's more fun with friends, who knows.."
16707,cool
16708,yes
16709,pp good
16710,"I'd have to say, this is a pretty solid game."
16711,"Overall a very fun game. There are 4 special classes, Melee (swords and stuff) Range (Guns, Bows and more) Mage (Spell tomes, Staffs and more) and summon (Staff to summon stuff to do stuff for you). One of the many good things is the weapon diversity. I mean come on we go from a literal prism of light (Last Prism) to a machine gun mixed with the future mixed withe an actual DOLPHIN (S.D.M.G) to a staff that summons a LLLOOONNNGGG dragon to a sword that uses other swords in its attacks! (Zenith) Ooh and the music I MEAN COME ON, IT IS WAY BETTER THAN MINECRAFT'S  MUSIC. Minecraft only has like 20 pieces but Terraria has surely over 25! Yes BTW this game doesn't have micro transactions. The mods are way easier to install to. All in all, this game is a solid 11/10 and is just as good, if not better, than Minecraft."
16712,FUN
16713,great game
16714,iTs juSt 2d miNecRaFt!!!11!!!! wHy wOuLd i PlaY A miNEcraFt clOnE??!!?!
16715,"Although it is a old game, it is still very fun!!!"
16716,I've beaten it once so far and I actually liked it a lot than most steam games.
16717,it's vary fun to play
16718,"I FUCKING LOVE THIS GAME. I mean yeah, it can be frustrating at times but it's fun!"
16719,yes is very cool its like tmod loader
16720,"Absolutely LOVE this game, no idea what half the things in it do but it's fun to try and find out."
16721,used to play this game when I was like what 7 or 8 and I just got this game again around 2 weeks ago I was contemplating if I should buy the game or not but my friend told me to just do it since its TERRARIA wow so i did we both made a world together me expecting that it would only last a day and here I am writing this review 100 hours later and a zenith.. LOL me and my friend beat all the bosses got a hell ton of achievements and its really really fun now its time for the garbage angler quests... What a game
16722,"This game is absolutely phenomenal. It can keep you busy for so long, and it's very very fun to play. There are so many different items and weapons to play with. The sprites in the game are very well made, and the bosses are all interesting and fun to fight. The complexity of the crafting recipes really makes it rewarding when you make a late game item. In conclusion, I think Terraria is one of my favorite games. And I think you should definitely try it out! (With a friend) 

1/10"
16723,"excellent game with fun bosses and progression, can be replayed over and over with different class setups and builds, not to mention consistent updates and an active modding community. everything you could want in a game!"
16724,Very cool game but when geometry dash 2.2?
16725,I think this game is really fun
16726,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
16727,EHHHHHHHHH
16728,"ok, so i have been playing this game for a long time and i have to say that it is SO GOOD, i reccomend that you search for some youtube guides to learn literally the basics of the game because it isn't that intuitive, but even without guides or looking at the wiki the game progression feels smooth, not in an overwhelming way like other games.

if you're looking for a game to just forget about your life and enjoy its experience terraria is a great game!
the visuals are simple but good, the music is beautiful and the progression is fun.
































































also one of the npcs is a furry so consider that when you're about to buy the game"
16729,Shit is hella fun although I don't play often anymore
16730,vanilla storage sucks but it's a game
16731,game that is good
16732,"PLEASE PLAY THIS WITH FRIENDS
10/10 game."
16733,theres no sex mod
16734,it is very good
16735,the game minecraft copied
16736,"Nice game, lots of stuff to craft and explore."
16737,"People love to compare this to minecraft, where I wouldn't totally disagree with the similarities brought up, but this game has many more mechanics that make it a far different experience. The exploration in this game is very rewarding and feels great to play blind, and the sheer variety of items, characters, and tools feels great to discover them. A few nitpicks are that the inventory management feels really awkward, some items feel pretty useless and just take up space, and it's extremely easy to get killed by having a surplus of enemies spawned in the early game. These problems are rare though, and its a wonderfully designed game, and the community is really nice too."
16738,gg
16739,solid game lol
16740,ah yes porn
16741,Big D definitely
16742,Just extremely fun to play. 10/10 would recommend.

16744,one of the best games of all time
16745,A m a z i n g. Its just better minecraft!
16746,You ever wanted a game that's like Minecraft but has actual confirmed lore and even has inclusions of Lovecraftian mythos? Then Terraria is the game for you! Fight off hordes of eldritch abominations and literal demons as you make a cute little log cabin!
16747,yes
16748,Put those 11 hours into one session worth it
16749,Yes
16750,"play game
"
16751,help
16752,Kinda like it
16753,I have played this game day after day with my friend just to feel happy about my self and how far I have gone. I have some of the best armor and i keep getting bullied by haunted armor. Yet I keep coming back just to see how far I can go. I will keep playing this game till my blood is slime gel and my eyes are demon eyes. 10/10 would play again and recommended.
16754,"10/10 , A lot more stuff to do than base Minecraft, Fun bosses and great progression."
16755,fun
16756, c
16757,love the game as i've completed the game as a wizard archer gun slinger fishermen honestly theres so many ways it's blessed

16769,amazing.
16770,great gmae and there's always something to do
16771,Best. Game. Ever.
16772,"terraria is such a splendid game i cant think of any flaws, i could probably play this game for a good while yet before feeling any boredom whatsoever. i rate the game a solid 8/10. the items the game gives you will last along time and have purpose past the first hour."
16773,"Right, I have quite a few things to say about this game, however in short, I absolutely think this game is worth anyone's time and simply not buying this game is in itself a waste of time, every single hour of the 500 hours I put into this game has been filled with so much fun and satisfaction.

**History**
This game was recommended to me by a very dear friend of mine, and I decided to try out this game as it was on a 50% sale, I've heard a lot about this game before actually buying it and it seemed quite interesting. I started playing this game firstly with my friends, (and I highly recommend doing so, preferably with a friend who has some experience, as the game is quite intricate and has a lot of content to become familiar with), which includes the friend who recommended this game to me, and at first the 2D aesthetic was a bit strange to me, I like most people compared this game to Minecraft, so the fact that the game was in 2D slightly disturbed me. However, after playing once with my friends then playing the game again with them a couple months later, I slowly started appreciating 2D, it allowed the game to feel simple and more compact, allowing me personally to enjoy the content the game has to offer. After a month, me and my friends beat the game, and it was the most fun I've had playing a game in a loooong time, the journey of Terraria is simply compelling and learning the game with my friends made the game 10x more enjoyable. After some time, I had the courage to start my own master mode play-through, I tried starting a solo play-through before, but I was still learning the game, I still have not beaten the game on my own, but trying the game on my own opened my eyes to a whole new world, I was able to unleash my creativity and make some amazing creations, which I am deeply proud of, and the journey on my own allowed me to further appreciate the dynamic of this game.

**Content & Progression**
The content as I already stated is plentiful and spectacular, and the game as you progress becomes just more and more satisfying. If you are fast and only focus on progression, you could finish this game in probably 20 hours, but if you take your time, you could spend at least 100+ hours on this game. I highly advise you to enjoy the game to its fullest, trust me, after you beat the game, working on vanity will be fun, but you won't have the excitement of looking forward to fight another boss. One thing you could do is if you put your npcs in a certain biome for a pylon, I suggest you make the houses slightly bigger and use blocks and furniture that fit the theme of the biome, take it from me, it is soooo much fun, your npcs may not care, but every time you teleport to a biome, you will be greeted with a neat and decorative house and not a simple shack. There are so many options and materials that you could build out of, allowing you to express your creativity in such a colorful way. Since this game is in 2D, exploring can become quite stale as the world is merely finite, but the bosses are one of my favorite parts of this game, each one has its own personality, attack patterns, and design, no boss fight has the same experience, which is what makes bosses a ton of fun. Difficulty is a big part of this game, the game can be a very simple and casual experience, or you can make it very difficult and intense, which you may think ruins the game, but it just makes the game extremely rewarding, harder difficulties make bosses drop certain items that are exclusive to only that difficulty, and re-logic has done an amazing job at giving you very cool items, like the relics you can only get in master mode; additionally, the game includes some secret seeds that can amplify the world and increase the difficulty, (For The Worthy, Not the Bees!, etc) which allows you to have an excuse to play this awesome game again and again. Bosses progress the game really smoothly in which certain bosses change the world in someway or add new enemies to the world or a specific place to make the game more difficult so you cannot get too comfortable and you will have to adapt to the changes. Another interesting element are evil biomes that attempt to spread and take over your world that you will have to constantly have to deal with especially in hard mode, in my opinion it is a very interesting premise that adds another factor of diffculty into the game.

**Criticism**
Although this game is great, there is one thing I must address about this game. The RNG in this game is absolutely ridiculous, some items have an unnecessarily low drop rate (ahem rod of discord), which can make the game feel quite grindy and very frustrating, additionally sometimes bosses simply refuse to drop certain items, which could be in part due to the many items that can be obtained from defeating a boss, this is especially evident in moon lord. When me and my friends played terraria, my friend decided to be a ranger, so he wanted the sdmg from the moon lord, and for some reason, it refused to drop for at least 15 moon lord battle, but eventually we did get it, but nontheless, TERRIBLE RNG.

**Conclusion**
In short, Terraria is a splendid game that is filled with amazing content and satisfaction, it is absolutely a game you should try and play, it will take a while to get used to certain aspects, but after at least a couple hours of playing this game, you will fall in love with this game and find yourself playing for hours at a time. The RNG is quite annoying and can make one want to pull your hairs out and eat their own fingers, but it does make you feel so rewarded when you get what you want. Overall, this game earns a 9/10, I only hope people read this and put hundreds of hours into this game."
16774,Hi. Im kind of incompetent at video games. Mainly because I just realized I need glasses. sucks man. But! If you like having your friends carry you so you can just build square houses and swing a sword. Also sometimes collect sand. This is a really good game! Even if you play alone...mainly cause you can get a pet slime. I rate this 5 out of 5 beef sticks.
16775,nice

16780,Best game ever!!!! So sad that 1.14 is the last big update
16781,2d minecraft good
16782,"played with a friend, problem was:
-he accidentally summoned the wall of flesh and killed it plummeting my world into hard mode

-he accidentally pissed off some cultists too in the same world while i was trying to get okayish hardmode gear.


overall its a good game just be careful of your friends cause they can make things harder than youd want :/"
16783,"reoidhjresihriihdsijfdij""!111111 terrarura is tcool aypi"
16784,"great game luv it
"
16785,"great game. fun to progress and easy to understand. if you enjoy progression in games this is for you as you start off as a powerless dude and by the end of the game you are like a god. there are multiple ways to play the game, those being the different classes such as a mage or a summoner."
16786,"played this game ages ago and it is still an amazing game. the combat, crafting, enemies, bosses, NPC, weapons/tools and etc are just awesome in their own way. playing with friends is another thing that is awesome as well and even single player is also awesome. im glad they're still updating this game. this game is just great"
16787,good when bored
16788,w game 5 hours in and its just a w game nothing
16789,ITS BETTER THAN MINECRAFT
16790,Good game but many time use
16791,"nice game
plz play with the wiki"
16792,Fun IG
16793,very god

16796,Minecraft 2d with 5 gazillion mods and more than 2 fps
16797,10/10
16798,"bee go brrrrrrrr
"
16799,"This might be the basic review, but its Minecraft but in 2D with more tools, weapons and armor"
16800,"With all honesty at first it was so overwhelming, I tried it long time ago and I HAD to quit. But now I can't stop playing after I came back. It's so addictive, it pulls you in and has so much content it's unreal."
16801,"great game and no it is not even close to minecraft so if you think ""TeRrArIa Is JuSt 2D MiNeCrAfT"" you are dumb"
16802,BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!
16803,"Wow, i just did 2 playthroughs and i have 227 hours.
This game is definitely worth it."
16804,"Very fun game, recommend that you at least give it a try, it's hard a first but once you understand the mechanics its a very fun and challenging game"
16805,nice game

16807,yes
16808,"it's like minecraft,

suck at claw thing and i don't know how to fly. 

10/10 would recommend."
16809,It's really fun and challenging.
16810,it  good
16811,"A truly amazing sandbox game. I also like how despite the fanbase getting angry at the fact that (Terraria is just 2D Minecraft), Terraria and Minecraft openly accept eachother."
16812,Terraria is a great game on of the best survival games similar to minecraft but 2d and better. You might be thinking why is it better than minecraft? well when terraria first came out it was 10$ so was minecraft currently in 2022 terraria is still 10$ and minecraft is 30$.
16813,good game

16833,A couple of months ago i played this on my xbox and didnt like it because i couldnt understand how to play but i bought it again for summer sale on pc but this time i had the wiki guide and this game is actually pretty fun although i dont have much time in the game ive had fun so far. So basically make sure to use the wiki or else your just gonna end up confused.
16834,Yes good

16840,"One of the best games I've ever played. Quirky, magical and filled with so many things to do. I feel that it's the better sibling of Minecraft. Pretty combat focused (amazing bosses), lots of building styles, funny moments, and the poster child for the ""Labor of Love"" reward. I always come back around to it. Plus, it converted my boyfriend into a Pixel Art lover, so that tells you enough right there."
16841,Good
16842,this game is ok i guess

16856,"Great game where you can spend a huge amount of time. Different biomes, a large number of bosses, a huge amount of armor and weapons. A huge plus is the multiplayer, where you can play with your friends."
16857,I'ts a really fun game that i enjoy it takes some practice to understand how to play and what bosses are the hardest but yeah overall a really fun game
16858,"this game is fun with friends when you get bored while playing normal play mods and theres many possibilitys
"
16859,A very fun simple game that is challenging. it also has the best music and the boss fights are super awesome!

16864,genuinely the most fun i've had playing single player
16865,Honestly one the most fun best time wasting games i have ever played. You can spend hours on it and not even realize it. The beginning may be tough if you don't know what to do but don't give up it is worth all the suffering.

16868,its really fun alone or with friends
16869,Confusing but good game
16870,funny game very cool
16871,"This game clearly has so much love poured into it, and the development team is so good to their community. I've played this since I was what, like, 12 or 13? I loved it then, and I still love it now. This game aged like a fine wine, with every update it just gets better and better. Grab yourself a couple of friends, preferably at least one person who already knows a bit about the game, and have a grand time. Explore, fight bosses, move up through a long progression getting better and better gear until your enemies fall before you. Take on difficult challenges like purifying your entire world, or making an underground subway across the whole world, and so much more. It's really good, I promise. It's so so so very worth it. Looking forward to the labor of love update."

16873,"If you have not played this game yet, GET ON IT. Wiki required"

16884,"Terraria √© o melhor jogo sandbox que eu j√° tive o prazer de jogar, tudo nesse jogo √© simplesmente fascinante, as boss fights necessitam de estrat√©gias e prepara√ß√µes para serem feitas (ao contr√°rio de outros jogos do g√™nero), os boss do jogo s√£o em sua total maioria muito memor√°veis e contam com uma trilha sonora √©pica. Al√©m disso Terraria conta com uma vasta quantidade de loot, que o jogador pode ir atr√°s, tendo uma grande variedade de armas e armaduras.

Terraria √© um jogo sem igual, eu mesmo subestimava muito o jogo at√© realmente joga-lo de verdade, eu acho incrivel como um jogo t√£o ""simples"" possa ser t√£o cativante e divertido."

16900,"So much better than Minecraft, it aint even funny. Love this game, Ive got thousands of hours across a couple accounts sunk into this game."
16901,"Basically what I would want Minecraft to be, or at least what I want a separate version of Minecraft to be. 
If you like punching trees, mining, farming Eye of Cthulhu 300 times to get a very specific piece of accessory, and more mining, then this is the game for you. 
Very enjoyable both solo and with friends. (Although I personally enjoy it with friends more).
And if you're done with vanilla, download some mods! There's hundreds of hours of content from the base game, and hundreds more from all the mods."
16902,Game is a timeless classic with endless possibilities. Solid 10/10 in my book
16903,GOOD

16917,This game is so addictive
16918,"Is a good game, but there are currently better options out there that innovate on Terraria's formula and they do it so well that I honestly don't know if I can recommend this game anymore--especially not on other platforms where the price is sometimes more than double (Nintendo Switch) for less content and no mods.

Honestly, I would've preferred if the dev team worked on Terraria 2 instead of all of these content updates--which most players probably won't even get to as the game would become boring after a while, it gets dropped, and the player picks it back up after a few months just to start a new character and a new world because they are no longer familiar with their old characters/worlds."

17001,Terraria is not just 2D Minecraft. Sure it is quite similar but Terraria is more complex with different stage of the game and actual bosses. It also has too many items in the game to remember. Terraria is so much fun and I recommend that you buy and play the game.

17072,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."
17073,Amazing
17074,its nice
17075,v good much good approove
17076,GOOD
17077,"Excellent game solo, even better with friends. If you enjoy exploring, deck building, character customization, adorable 8bit graphics, and/or challenging bosses, this game is probably for you! There's a surprising amount of content, plus you can spend endless hours just fooling around. One of my favourite games of all time."

17090,"The game is really great mostly because it lets you do what you want and if you want to play by yourself or with friends. It's also a great game because if you want to speed run the game you can but it also offers the choice of open world free style play, making it a great experience overall. Another thing about this awesome game is that the possibility are endless so anythings you build will be unique and that there is no wright or wrong option to your builds. If you are a player who doesn't want to beat the game and just make builds you are able to do that, or if you want to beat the game and become a GOD you can do that. Though the game isn't free the money will be 100% worth it because of all the things Terraria has to offer."

17099,Fun Sandbox Game for Builders!
17100,"best game ever, for the price of $10 I have gotten more playtime out of this than collectively every AAA title i own. even 10 years later they are still pushing out new content, maybe not intentionally *cough cough ""the final update""* for being called ""2D minecraft"" i think i does not live up to the name, it fucking destroys that name and replace it with the title of ""Game For The Gods."" and if the base game does not satisfy you then go play one of the mods that adds hundreds of hours of playtime.
the early game can be boring but once you beat that barrier there is no going back."
17101,very cool fight fight mine mine
17102,"It's minecraft 2d with variety. It's fun game with a ton of stuff to do and explore, and even a ton of bosses."

17200,"I usually don't give reviews, but since I own this game on 3 other devices, with this being my newest addition on Steam, my game hours combined totaling 1000+ hours, I can say that out of all the versions out there, this is the definitive version of Terraria. The ability to add extra content, such as texture packs, worlds, and mods, the game has endless replay-ability. The game doesn't need high-end devices in order to run well (I mean I'm playing on my laptop right now and it runs perfectly). I think the thing that I cannot stress enough, and other people will agree, is the price. Even without a Steam sale, the game is already pretty cheap and it's worth WAY more than the $10 you have to pay in my opinion. I recommend it to anyone, especially people who like adventure sandbox games or indie-feel games."
17201,"2D Minecraft but combat is better, terraforming is better, progression is better, explosives are better, etc. You don't get the cool crafting grid though."
17202,why my game will become slow motion when i enter any world??? it was normal when in main menu and i've tried small world but still same??? why??? the game is good but my game always turn into slow motion so i can't play the game normally!

17207,"Probably one of my all time favorites. I particularly enjoy how simple it seems, even though it takes a bit of getting used to."
17208,very fun
17209,this game is so much fun i will play till i become a sith with the lightsaber
17210,"an awesome adventure game, havent played much yet and ive only beat 2 bosses but i cant wait to continue my journey"
17211,2D Minecraft with better progression
17212,Don't think this is just 2D Minecraft. This is one of the best sand box rpg games ever made and definitely worth your time and money. Gets way better with friends.
17213,i question my sanity everytime i do a terraria playthrough. everything else in your life does not matter until you beat the game. the absolute rage that this game sends coursing through my veins in unmatched. possibly #1 all time
17214,"It's a pretty cool game overall
"
17215,game good bc good game
17216,cool game B) relogic at amozon box with jeff bezos pet plzzzzz :):)
17217,ive made three worlds and all of them ive lost to not having a backup ther is not reason to loss my worlds for absolutly no reason
17218,"So versatile, better bang for your buck on singleplayer mode"
17219,i have bought this game at least 3 times
17220,Amazing game with unique concepts like boss battling and enemy fighting
17221,funny eye

spent the rest of the game underground. 17hours was enough"
17229,Idk why but multiplayer is not work for me. but game is pretty fun.
17230,gbvcn
17231,"Minecraft but 2d is the elevator pitch for this game. it has tons of weapons and items spanning over a 1000 items.  it has a chill community with many servers that you and your friends can play. but can be a bit grindy and annoying. it has good progression and provides a slight challenge ( depends on what mode you play on Normal, Expert, and Master mode ). If you get this game I recommend getting Tmodloader for mods since it adds a lot more to the game making its own story lines or mechanics which enhances gameplay"
17232,"Cool game, I love to build."
17233,Bro just play it
17234,"epicness
game is rated 4/4
i wanna take a pic with cardi b

17235,good game recomend
17236,Yes there is a lot to learn and it will take a while for you to understand everything but once you start playing it really is hard to stop. There is so much to this game and I am only probably half way through it myself.
17237,yes
17238,CC
17239,Terraria is one of my favorite games with endless replay ability. Definitely worth the purchase and a 10/10 for me.
17240,"Good game. The pixel art and game play is good, but progression can get slow sometimes."
17241,pixel guy go brrrrr
17242,good

17247,"Having owned this game for almost 7 years and having roughly 2600 hours in it, I think it's about time that I review it.  I bought this game back in 2015 for only $5 and I have loved every second of it.  Being compared on numerous occasions to Minecraft, I would prefer Terraria due to its creative and adventurous nature.  Over the years I have had a blast starting playthroughs with my friends and seeing what insane builds the community has done.  Truly the only limit to this game is yourself; in other words anything is possible.  So next time this game is on sale snatch it up as fast as you can.  But also don't think you're wasting money if you buy it at full price; trust me, you'll get your money's worth.

P.S. I sincerely hope the MoonLord can find his legs someday.  It is a shame it's taken him this long, though he's been doing pretty fine without them."

17257,"if you play minecraft
delete this piece of shit game and go buy this instead
REASONS:
1. cheaper than minecraft
2. more fun
3. lots of things to do
4. good fanbase (mostly)
WHY MINECRAFT FUCKING SUCKS:
1. expensive as fuck
2. not even fun
3. you get diamonds and you're pretty much done with this game (if you can't beat the dragon like me)
4. garbage fanbase (like at all)

17291,alright this is an obvius choice to start off with steam because you spend half the price of minecraft for near double the content and modding is absolutely free with tmod it is a great start for communities everyone is helpful meme-ish and of course friendly with a little constructive criticism sometimes and the gameplay is on point smooth non linear progression best described by uberdanger the modding community can be weird sometimes but you wont see that on the front page and of course one of the best things being that the gameplay never gets dry there are always new challenges to attempt but 1 thing is that this is not a sandbox so it does indeed end but that what modded is for so this is litteraly the best 10$ spent in my life

17332,The best game ever!!! I started playing on the xbox 360 then on the xbox 1 and finally on pc.
17333,Its alright
17334,"I am a 41 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

17391,"ABSOLUTLY WORTH IT

You might think its too complicated, but when you have the wiki on your side and a couple videos of letsplays of other youtubers, you will learn, and it has so many mods, and i heard calamity is much fun! I reccomend you play the normal terraria before hooking on mods.

TL;DR Absolutly worth the price!"
17392,"""Fine then, The truth. I do need capital. And playtime. Wanna know why?, I have a dream. That one day, Every steam user in this nation will control their OWN copy of terraria. A mod community of the TRULY free, dammit. A terraria of ACTION, not words. Ruled by COMMUNITY, Not developers. Where the game changes to suit the individual, not the other away around. Where updates and power are back where they belong: in the hands of the people! Where every player is free to think -- to act -- for themselves! Fuck all these limp dick modders and chicken-shit gatekeepers. Fuck this 24/7 internet spew of journey's end bullshit. Fuck final updates. Fuck the media! Fuck all of it! Steam is diseased. Rotten to the core. There's no saving it -- we need to pull it out by the roots. Wipe the slate clean. BURN IT DOWN! And from the ashes, a new Terraria will be born. Evolved but still being updated! The weak will be purged, and the strongest will thrive -- free to live as they see fit, they will make Terraria GREAT AGAIN!""

""What the hell are you talking about?""

""You still dont get it, Im using Terraria as a business to get elected into steam awards.. So i can end the steam awards as a business! In my new Steam, Games will die and kill for what they BELIEVE! Not for money, Not for upvotes, Not for what they're told is profitable. Every user will be free to fight in his own Terraria!""

The sheer amount of content and play-styles is unfathomable for a game with such a small development team. I started playing Terraria back in 2013 on the Xbox 360, and even to this day I still come across things I have never seen before. I cannot commend Re-Logic enough for their love and dedication towards this game. Masterpiece 10/10."

While it is a great game it can be a little grindy at times and certain points in the game and it does have some difficulty spikes most of the game is quite enjoyable (Especially with some friends!)  and all-round it is fun and nice to play in and mess around."

17459,"Apparently I have to write a review to get some Steam exp, and from my entire library this game is the most deserving of a positive review, and believe me when I tell you that the bar wasn't set low, as the other options were the likes of Subnautica and Titanfall 2, which are absolute bangers.

What really sets Terraria apart is the love it gets from the devs. The ""labor of love"" award from 2021 didn't come from nowhere. I finished the endgame and maxed out my gear on console previously, had to get it on Steam when i built my PC. The gameplay is just plain fun, the progression is engaging, and there's a ton of content to experience. You always have stuff to do, exploring your world, building a base for your NPCs to stay in, getting the materials to upgrade your gear, progressing towards a bossfight, or fighting off an invasion. The replayability potential may be kinda hit or miss, I still had fun going through the game a few times, but I can definitely understand people who wouldn't play it for a second time. Still, it never got boring for me. Terraria is a lot of fun solo, but playing in coop with a few friends elevates the experience to a whole new level. The abundance of gear, materials and enemies sometimes makes the use of wiki a necessity.

One thing that's important to discuss, is that you can often hear that ""Terraria is just a 2D Minecraft clone"", which is bullshit. Both have common elements, sure, both utilize block grids, be it 2d or 3d, both include crafting, mining and fighting monsters. This is where the major similiarities end. Terraria has a much deeper progression system than Minecraft, with more bosses, more items, a literal class system, and NPCs which are a lot more nuanced than Minecraft villagers, while Minecraft also has a lot of stuff that you won't find in Terraria. Both games are their own thing, they play differently, and I love each of them dearly, but comparing them is like comparing Rainbow Six to Overwatch, or Europa Universalis to Civilization. Yeah, sure, there are common elements, some of them are pretty major, but it's still apples and oranges.

The game is constantly getting updated with new, free content, even as it nears the end of its life cycle. Wherever the devs go with the project, be it update 2.0, or a standalone Terraria 2, I'm sure that it's gonna be a blast to play.

TLDR: Love the game, highly recommend it - lots of content, free updates, a real blast, even more so in coop."
17460,This is a fun game to play with friends or solo. It's packed with plentiful monsters to battle and lots of terrain. I quite enjoy it.

17487,Truly one of the best value games on Steam and a real labor of love. Once you start making progress it gets addicting and you'll want to keep pushing your character and world further which speaks to how well the game is designed. There are some huge grinds in this game and you can spend hours searching for rare ore or items however other players can invite you to their worlds and give you money and items to speed you through the game instead if you want to skip them. I had a blast getting 100% of the achievements and it's heartwarming to see the developers still support the game a decade later with small updates here and there. Terraria is a must-play.
17488,good game

17491,Its good
17492,I have 90 hours in this game and both can and can‚Äôt remember a single thing I did in it - 10/10 game with an 11/10 modding community. I would say do what I did and try and learn it by having friends teach you but to be honest it seemed like my friends knew what was going on less than I did sometimes
17493,ez
17494,Good game except I have no idea what I'm doing without the wiki.
17495,Good Good Good Cool Beans

17501,"I absolutely Love it, if you can get friends to play it, then the experience is even better(depending on the friends)."
17502,very gooch
17503,vry good
17504,"Not many people have taken the time to appreciate the design and care put into this game. it is really hard to find a balance of progression in the items, ores, and difficulty of bosses. it is something the modders of this game struggle to compete with.

despite its ultimately linear progression, The game never ceases to surprise me with all of its features that add replay-ability (which sucks the life out of us) such as the golfer npc and minibosses where you really need to know the game to be able to find. Although the game could do without these features, the developers choose to add them because it is fun, and that's all that matters.

Re-Logic have rightfully earned the Labor Of Love 2021. They have continuously made balance changes and expanded the game even after 10 years of release. Huge pat on the back for not releasing a Terraria 2, the game is already Terraria 2"
17505,very fun game to play with friends

17569,"This game is a side-scrolling dungeon adventure. Most of the realm can be manipulated with various tools, which allows you to build homes. If you do it right, other NPCs will move in, too. It took me awhile to discover there are realms above as well as below the ground floor. Terraria is a classic and even years later I find myself installing it for some fun."
17570,ahahhaha

17625,"gaming
"
17626,"I can't explain how good this game is. Every playtrough is different, every item is so unique, the soundtrack is amazing. Every detail about this game is fantastic. With 800 hours on record (including modded version) I am guaranteed that I still have more things to discover about Terraria. It truly is an awesome experience and I strongly recommend that you try it out. And for 11$, this game will repay itself a thousand times."

Worst 10 euros spent in my life. This game is so increadibly boring it hurts my brain. I honestly don't know what do people see on this game. It's a pixel 2D piece of crap that your friends force you to play because their braincells are already dead and therefore they can't see how trash this game is. After our first game session I deleted the game and I don¬®t regret it at all. Deleting this game was the best choice I ever made so for the love of god, don't let your friends pull you down into playing this shit. You will thank me later, trust me."

17651,"This game is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone. 

Finally got all 104/104 achievements (If they add more I'm definitely coming back)

Things to note:
- If you intend to 100% the achievements, fish while you do everything else. (12 hours of grinding... sometimes more...)
- Go at your own pace, this game is very fun no matter your play style
- Playing with friends is great 
- Mob farms are a huge help if you are sleeping the night often or grinding for gear
- Make a planter farm (The sooner the better)
- The wiki is your best friend
- Try building and painting as you go through (Box houses are kinda bleh)
- Try to keep your characters to one world (Progression is the fun part of the game)
- Don't cheat.... ruins all the fun of the game, even if it is just for a vanity item. 

The big thing is to just take it easy, this game is perfect for a good time UvU"

17653,"Terraria more than deserves the Labor of Love award. Re-Logic has gone above and beyond to keep adding to this already wonderful game, making it filled to the brim with content to explore. This is definitely a must have Steam game."
17654,"Highly Recommend Playing Terraria, It's super fun and entertaining and you never run out of things to do. Defeated the final boss as a Melee? Good, now try playing mage. Played with every class in normal mode? Try Expert or even Master mode. Completed everything in the game? download mods and unlock a new experience."

17658,it's a good time
17659,yeah
17660,i love it
17661,Great 2d style game.
17662,"Great game.
"
17663,"Placing blocks is clunky, there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to placing them, can do things mid air while jumping, cant do certain other block placing while under water, things aren't telegraphed very well I dont know why this game is popular or has good reviews, the solo play was incredibly boring. refunding."
17664,its very fun
17665,100% terraria simp
17666,"I'd recommend this game, but it's hard. It doesn't tell you what to do and it's not that logical, so you're just going to find stuff and then use the wiki, if you want to progress."
17667,"I started playing this game with absolutely no knowledge of what was happening, but all I needed to do was dig a little deeper or walk a little farther, and Terraria would reward me with some whimsical adventure that always felt fresh and new. There is something interesting under every stone, and I never get bored of this game. The devs are always updating and improving it, so whenever I log on, there is still more fun to be had. Easily one of my favorite games."
17668,is nice
17669,its a good game
17670,i have to say after playing Terraria since it's launch its gone from a great game to one of my favourite games ever through the various updates. Sad to see that there wont be any major updates anymore but still a fantastic game. But beware of the bats they love pushing you into lava :)
17671,GAME PLAY GOOD MY FRIENDS DOG ENJOYS EATING THE GRASS

Terraria is a timeless classic that has such an unbelievable amount of value packed into it, I think Terraria is worth the asking price of triple A games."
17685,good and entertaining
17686,very good lol
17687,one of my favorite games. i think in some ways its better than minecraft. sure its grindy and sometimes frustrating but boss fights and general iidea is very fun. locking away cutest boss exclusive pets behind the hardest difficulty (3x dmg instead of normal mode) is a sin.

Overall, I really love this game and have been playing it for years across different consoles and I think it was really well done and certainly brought a lot of happiness to my childhood years.
"
17693,It's Fun
17694,good game
17695,good game nothing more to say tho enemy spawns can be annoying as f--k some times
17696,Worth every penny ! DEFINITELY try it out it‚Äôs fun alone and with friends plenty of stuff to do plenty of quirky funny side items.  Never will get bored of weapons as there‚Äôs so many.
17697,"Best version of the game, especially with the workshop (10/10)"
17698,One of the best games I've ever played.
17699,Fun but needs paitence which i dont exactly have
17700,i pissed on merchant
17701,"The best overrated game I know,  it's a GREAT game worth its price several times over,  but it feels a little empty. 
Some aspects of the game are heavily reliant on luck and grinding, the building although with an overwhelming amount of options is not encouraged, too many items just don't have a use, world generation is repetitive and often botched, it feels like quantity over quality in most regards. 
Some people compare Terraria to Minecraft, but they differ in that in Minecraft every item and mechanic serves multiple purposes and are well thought out, and the building thrives in its simplicity, Terraria adds thousands of mechanics and items and enemies without much thought, and the building although with more options is not as rewarding. 
Any game can have loads of content, but it takes a good one to give that content meaning.

 I would still play the game, it's really fun."
17702,"The product is excellent, can be purchased at a low price especially during discount periods.
The game itself is well done, playing online with friends is a lot of fun.
It is essential to use external wikis to continue the game.
Optimal"
17703,"I am a 22 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
17704,Very fun game to play
17705,"Very fun game. Whether it be solo or with friends, the Terraria experience is just challenging all in all."
17706,e
17707,"I've been playing this ever since I got it on my iPad a very long time ago. Mobile gamer moment. Bought it on my Xbox 360, and now I play it on my computer. Very fun game with over 200+ hours I've spent all across different platforms. If you don't have this, please get it. On sales, it's about 5 dollars and it will be the best 5 dollars you've ever spent."
17708,"very good game. however im stuck at the eye of cthulhu, any tips on how to beat this boss? its very scary i sometimes cry when i sleep because i can feel him watching me while i sleep. he/she (im scared to misgender the eye ball) is always watching me no matter what i do. please fix this bug mr developers. either way good game i approve."
17709,Me gusta mucho
17710,This just hits the nostalgia...
17711,nice
17712,"One of the best games i've ever played. It is so fun to play with your friends, i really reccomend it."
17713,Not done much but pretty fun game
17714,Berry cool
17715,goo
17716,"Strongly recommend it! I keep coming back, and I've still never 'completed' it. Always more to do, and fun to play with friends."
17717,Wasted 42 hours and still wanna more
17718,block game üëç
17719,epic
17720,tons of fun! the game is around 60 hours for a whole playthrough from what i've heard
17721,good
17722,Nice game ^^
17723,"It has a steep learning curve, without checking the wiki it can be hard to know what you should do but after you get the hang of basic mechanics and by arming yourself with the wiki, this game becomes very addicting"
17724,"This game is very complicated for my 2 brain cells, but it's really fun."
17725,very good game buy it RIGHT NOW
17726,"fun good w friends, stronngly suggest trying it out
"
17727,"This is a labor of love game, played it during 360 era of games it was bloody awesome and fun, and still is today, good pixel game, and as a small joke goes, 2d Minecraft with alot of gear n loot n bosses. fun gamplay, good controls, and good for an ARPG with some survival mechanics being nightly hordes coming to try n kill ya, and special events that act as wave defenses you must survive. good game all round in my opinion."
17728,this game  is for based people who eat hamburgers for lunch and eat olive garden this game is probably better than talking to your family my only gripe is more addicting than all addictive stuff in the galaxy perc 30 dookie weed horrible 15 milli vinlli grams of terraria OH MY GAH
17729,best 2d game i ever played
17730,"love the game classic og
"
17731,good
17732,good game I have tons of fun with it. Theres many things to do so you will rarely get bored while playing this
17733,"Yes, go play it! FFS! Is good game!"
17734,ABUBAKIBAB
17735,the worst game i have ever played. do NOT play unless you want to waste your hard earned cash.
17736,Had it since 2015 (now I rebought it) and the game is absolutely 10/10
17737,"Great game, can't wait for 1.4.4."
17738,ŸÑÿπÿ®ÿ© ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿ≤ÿ®Ÿä
17739,I suck at terraria :(
17740,I feel bad for only paying 5‚Ç¨ for this masterpiece.
17741,"get the game its good, stop skulking in bad reviews this game is a masterpiece"
17742,No reason to choose this shit oven minecraft
17743,yes
17744,"time fly's by, enjoy it"
17745,I loved dying every second when i accidentally dashed into an explosive bunny in for the worthy.
17746,"Ah yes, Terraria, it swelled over the years, in terms of content but never got bloated, has very fun movement mechanics, and got a good ammount of quality of life features. Building in 2D can post some challanges, but can often lead to quite creative solutions, but than again the game is also very combat focused, with different equiptment build opportunities and loads of different enemies and bosses. Also exploration is quite an important part of terraria, having you find new things as you bit by bit go deeper and explore the boundaries of the map. But than you beat a certain Boss, and suddenly the whole world changes, already explored biome brim with newer more hostile and stronger hostile life but also a new bounty of ressources and you got to explore your previously prospected areas again without it feeling old.

I gotta say its really good, and if you say, well I still dont want to pay full price for it (which isnt even steep) just wait for a sale, terraria usually goes on sale a few times a year for 50% to 90% so you can pick it up than and maybe even for some friends for some pocket change."
17747,Moon Lord reminds me of my fathere.He beats the shit out of me.
17748,"Game is great. Expert is balanced best mode, master is poorly balanced (they just tripled all hp and damage, with barely any new rewards that actually help) but is fun. 

Also dont play summoner if you like having fun"
17749,yes
17750,niceeee
17751,good game
17752,this game is a fucking steal for 10 bucks

17764,"if ur reading this xander, I already refunded this game"
17765,"Best 2d game ive ever played, the simplicity of Mine > Get equipment > Fight boss > repeat is really fun and addicting"

17774,dont play with exploiters and go to hell within your first hour playing
17775,"Despite 1.4 having many many many many many many things that I greatly dislike, and honestly being the worst update in the game's history. If you're just playing casually with friends or whatever, (like 99% of the community does) then the game is fine. Otherwise if you've been playing for awhile, and like to complete character after character like me, then this update is complete garbage."
17776,game gud
17777,"This is hands down my favorite game, I love everything about it. It is very replayable, there's a lot to do and a lot to explore."
17778,yes
17779,GOOD GAME EVEN THOUGH I ONLY PLAYED 1.5 HOURS.
17780,ds
17781,Great game I recomend playing with friends
17782,Someone once described this game as what if minecraft was a 2D metroidvania with lovecraftian style bosses. That's the best way I can describe it and I LOVE IT!
17783,Everything about this game is awesome! Even more fun with a friend!
17784,good game
17785,great game it is only 10 bucks but it is full of content and different ways to play
17786,Yes
17787,"I like accessories

17788,"VERY FUN, great bossfights, and nice length ""story"""
17789,porn mods
17790,This game reminds me of terraria!
17791,"Fun af, dont compare this game to Minecraft they are not very alike"
17792,This game nice. Very cool game when it comes to killing time.
17793,very fun game yes
17794,fart
17795,"Terraria is fun, they added steam workshop support along with resourcepacks. This game is really fun to play with friends especially if you are willing to grind/have fun on the game. This game takes a bit to learn but in my opinion I just think its like Minecraft but [strike]2D[/strike] with lots of items. I also like they added tavernkeep with DD2 references. So many cool items to get and you can get pretty creative with building. I like their mechanic/wire things. Overall a great game, if there is not much to do you can always download mods from TModLoader, loads of great mods."
17796,"so much good fun with friends too i love gam (tmodloader is good too, chec it out)"

17841,good funny game that i smack friends into lava. also funny turtle is super nice.
17842,"The developers have put so much care and love in this masterpiece.
You simply have to play it to experience its full glory for yourself.
Can be for solo players, those with ka-duo, and for the ones who ventures with factions."
17843,I have enjoyed this game very much and played for 65 hours and recommend it towards others
17844,"you can strap dynamite to rabbits, i'm sold."
17845,"So immersive with its gameplay. Everything looks good with the pixel-style art this game has, and overall it is just a veery nice game."
17846,Terraria is a classic and a must-play for all. Seriously
17847,"Good Game, had fun!"
17848,"Peashooters and sunflowers are essential for the early game, but you should be fine once you get the repeater and wall-nut, you should be good. The Zen garden really calms me down and I love the benefits of being able to get coins from marigolds when I take care of them. It‚Äôs nice to see the smiles on their faces. I love this game since it brought me so much nostalgia, and is just good overall. Cattail is broken and needs nerfing, but other than that, looks good. 8.5/10, would play more, WILL play more, ratio, L bozo, there‚Äôs a zombie on your lawn, XD lmao, counter ratio, cancelled."

I believe the game could cost more for the amount of content and replayability you receive with this game. The amount of content in the base game more than makes up for its price. The modding capabilities are practically endless with the steam workshop on hand. This game is in my favorites for the rest of time!"

17947,"This games was recommended to me by some friends and they did a good job with most of it. Terraria is basically a 2D platformer version of minecraft. What stopped me from playing this game was the monsters. if we pretend this game is the world, then I am in Africa, and there is only monster in the game, and that monster is in Canada, it will hunt me down in Africa and find me, and try to kill me. 

I lost count of how many times I died underwater, from monsters tracking me down, and how many times I got bumped from ledges. If they were to change monsters to line of sight, this game would be fantastic. but as it is, in its current state I cannot recommend this game."

17970,"After 200 hours of playing this game (plus another 800 hours on mobile), I can confidently say that this is my favorite video game for many reasons:

     1. It is not a Minecraft clone. ( I think that it's actually better than Minecraft)

     2. It is easily worth 10 dollars. (it is also frequently on sale for even less)

     3.  The game has so much content that even as an experienced player, I often discover things I had no idea 
     existed

     4. The game has infinite replayability. During my 1000 hours playing this game, I have completed almost ten 
     playthroughs just in the the game default game mode. (there are many other options to choose from as 
     well.

I highly recommend that you play this game. You will not regret it.

(by the way, did you see the the extra ""the"" i put in the review?)"

18035,"There are already so many great reviews for Terraria, if you're if looking for a reason to play this game in 2022, this game has so much love jam packed into it. Game progression feels great, after you craft new gear or kill a new boss, you feel yourself getting more and more powerful. If you're the type of person who loves to decorate and collect... This game is GREAT. So many great items to collect. Lastly, I LOVE TO FISH IN GAMES!!! And GOSH DANG IT... This has to be one of my favorite games to fish in! There isn't really a mini game or anything to fishing but fishing is so WORTH IT! I mean it. Fish in every biome, every pool of liquid! Anyway, Play Terraria"

18083,"There are no words in my vocabulary that can do justice in describing Terraria. This game is about so much and exploring all of that is about of a journey that needs to be experienced to really enjoy everything that is offered. While this game is not a written narrative, there is a progression of events that change and affect the gameplay, making it feel more alive. Building, combat, exploration. Everything Terraria offers is a delight to play and I still come back to this game to enjoy discovering everything all over again."

18103,"Ahh, Terraria... You were one of my early indie games that I experienced when I was still in high school. I played you through our local cafe, which was obtained through the ""seven seas"" method... I still remember your old background, sun, trees, and smaller camera view. I can't progress much further, due to time limits on using the cafe's service, and I have other games to play. I didn't think much of you first, but I still had some attention to you. I watched what endgame level looks like ( when the endgame has the Excalibur as the best and final melee weapon ), and was awed.

Some years passed, and I have a decent non-gaming rig that can run you. Though I obtained it through the ""yaargh"" way, I liked you and was set to get you legally when I can finally earn some money. My household disapproves owning credit card ( also known here as ""loan card"" ), and I don't like paying extra for Steam Cards. I watched you grow to become something worth every money given to you. In my early days, I titled you as the ""2D Minecraft""... And now I thought of you as the ""2D Minecraft With Better Content"".

I finally got you when a sale arrived, and a new ""no added fees"" way to add money to my Steam Wallet arrived.


NOTE: Pirated games are basically just ""demos with full access to the game""."
18104,"this game iz entyrely about stalin and russian history so i bardzo dont recommend it because its stupid
HE HE HE HAW"
18105,"I have played this game so many times over the years. I have 478 hours logged for this one so far. it's amazingly good. Once you beat the game, which is going to take you many many hours to do, the only thing left is to start over on a harder difficulty. Each world is randomly generated and no two play-through are going to be the same. I tend to bounce between new games and circle back to my favorites, and this is one I keep coming back to. It's that good! if you are into 2D pixel art games, and survival, this is a no brainer. It feeds my OCD for digging, exploring, building, and hording lots of loot!"

18118,"This game has such a re-playable value its insane. When I decide to play Terraria, the hours seem to melt away, until I realise I've spent 8 hours building structures and arenas. The bosses are super fun and the music is KILLER. Honestly, the music is so great that I've even gone on Youtube and played it outside of the game itself. 

I love how diverse the NPCs are, and how money is both easy to get, and difficult to keep.

Terraria is a really great game, especially if you like other building and fighting games."

18240,"This game can be fun no matter what and even more fun with friends if you are just playing around to fighting bosses. Just have fun, do what you want to do."
18241,"I own this game for every system it came out on, even played a ton of TMod Loader to extend the fun even further. I recommend this game to everyone I come across. The old granny sitting on her porch, Terraria. My almost 2 year old, Terraria. Random guy at the bar, have you heard of our lord and savior Terraria? I can't say enough about how many hours of enjoyment I've had playing this game solo and with friends. This is one of my top 10 all time favorite games."

"
18275,"The Yelets is a Hardmode yoyo. After defeating any mechanical boss, this yoyo has a 1/200 (0.5%) chance to drop from any enemy killed in the Jungle and Underground Jungle, including in the Jungle Temple.

It has a spin duration of 14 seconds, and can reach up to 18 tiles.

Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
18276,OG game = still good
18277,"Heya, back again to bring you a GEM, a real cult classic.
While i usually help other people stay away from painful games and communities, this one had to be done.
Play this game, mod it, then play it again. Get bored, let it collect some dust, bust it back out on a cold rainy fall evening, and revel in the nostalgia.
I'm a fucking veteran of this game, i started playing it on the damn PS3 years back while it was still in development there. Looking back at those good times when taxes and mandatory psychological torture wasn't the norm, fills me with hope and nostalgia. With my personal  thingies out of the way....
Terraria is a 2D cave crawler/Boss fight game, while the intricacies of the ""plot"" are undefined, the design is killer, the music is unique, and never been done before. The combat starts off very simple, but ends with something we can agree is batshit insane, but in a good way. Terraria is one thing, ""simple"", yet it takes that word and blows it to the moon in every aspect. Your movement starts off slow and painfully simple, and by the end you will travel at mach 7 and fly fast enough to pierce the skies 10 times over, and the best thing, enemies are made to keep track with you along your progression. You will start by dying to a measly little blob of jelly, and end with killing literal gods. If this sounds like dopamine to you, play this. I'M NOT FUCKING ASKING!!"
18278,I'm having a good time. You can really go as fast  or as slow as you want. I've been playing 66 hrs and only defeated two bosses so far. there's just so much content
18279,idk bruh
18280,what can i say its terraria.
18281,This game is very fun and cool (please let me and my family go i've done everything you asked for)
18282,this isnt minecraft
18283,azon kivul hogy kuvra unalmas egesz oke
18284,gotta love the bullshit zero knockback on hardmode
18285,"Easily one of the best games of all time. If you don't already own this game somehow, hurry up and buy it and then buy it for your friends and then buy it for your friend's friends and then buy it for your grandma and your dead uncle and your baby cousins and your dog. Don't buy it for your cat though, those feline bastards are up to something."

18299,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Not only the devs are supporting the game for a long time, but also there is a crap ton of community content for it, essentially making it an endless game with endless hours of content.
Also, I bought this on summer sale 2022 when it got 50% off, the price is literally a steal of a steal."

18312,I disliked that it take's 1 year to get the zenith (Totally not exagurated. I dont know how to spell.)I like the base of the game though.
18313,Do you like having your god complex being crushed and wittled down by a slime a fraction of your size that just gained and insurmountable amount of hp from killing a wall made of pure flesh and bone held together by tissue thus giving you PTSD? Then yeah it's a pretty good game

18384,yes
18385,"No Words. Game is just simply too good. You can play hours and hours and not feel bored. Build a whole friking town for npcs or try to beat the game by slaying all the bosses, it doesn't matter. When you think you finally catched up, and defeated certain boss, game suddenly became harder, as if there's no ending to it. Even if you won the game (takes more than 50h+(google search)), you can always add mods to add certain bosses, biomes, tools, etc. And that's not even expensive (during sale)."

I have spent so much time playing alongside one of my best friends, all for the price of $5 USD. That's incredible value. Thank you to the developers of Terraria for providing me with entertainment from my teens well into my twenties. :)"
18443,le classico
18444,Why buy Mindcraft when the better game is clearly Terraria.
18445,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
18446,"This sandbox game is one of the reasons I play games on my computer so much, since it truly allows the player to run free while still incorporating boss fights and events into the mix. The game itself doesn't have much story, but the premise of the game makes you want to keep playing and replaying it for different reasons. Like to keep your distance but still deal damage? Want to be able to tank bosses while still dealing great damage? This 2D game really lets you do that with 4 different classes. Melee, with medium damage and high defense, Ranger, with above average damage and medium defense, Mage, with high damage and below average defense, and Summoner, with summoned minions that deal very high damage but leave you with the lowest defense out of the 4 classes. All 4 of these classes allow you play the game diversely with each playthrough, whether it's singleplayer or multiplayer, the game provides both simple and complex ways to get items. One of my only gripes about this game is about the rare items and the farms that may be needed to get them. I have spent around 2,000 hours in the game and still don't have every achievement and item. I believe that some of the rarer items, like the Zenith requires a lot of different enemies to kill, while the Terraprisma requires you to beat a bullet hell-like boss without getting hit. The game really challenges your skill with dodging in a 2D Sandbox game. I really do suggest this game, as playthroughs can take as little time as 2-3 days if you play fast. Even if you dislike the enemy farming, you can just go through the game most of the time without it. Most bosses can drop items that can carry you farther than some of the rarer items can. Another great thing about it is the building. The possibilities in this game are endless, allowing for all kinds of things to be built and made. I suggest you buy this game, and even if you dislike it, you can download TModLoader and play all sorts of mods that can change the base game, allowing for a different experience."

18504,"In my mind Terraria has always been a Minecraft clone. Just doing a similar thing in a slightly different way. I didn't really understand why people praised this game so much. After playing it i'll give it to them i can see why they like this game but i still feel like they exaggarete just how much they like the game. Its a good game but i don't think its as good as some people say. At least now i know that even tho Terraria and Minecraft may be similar there is still some major differences between the two.

+The graphics surprisingly look good.
+Interesting monsters. Tons of interesting locations to explore too.
+The fact that when you chop down the base part of a tree it actually breaks the entire tree is really nice. I hate that in Minecraft half of the tree will be flying in the air even tho the base part isn't connected to the ground anymore. Doesn't happen here the tree actually breaks entirely. Unfortunately this does not happen with other objects except sand. When you break a block of sand the remaining sand on top of that block will fall downwards. Like in Minecraft. But when you break a stone block, dirt block or something then eh well nothing really happens. Some blocks will keep flying in the air, not connected to anything. Still not bad.
+Quality of life things like taking or putting everything in a chest at once, pressing a button so your inventory gets auto sorted, looking at a tree and holding shift which automatically brings up your axe or looking at stone on the ground and holding shift which automatically brings up your pickaxe etc these small quality of life improvements are really good.
+Surprising amount of customisation options. I didn't even know you could create a character in this game.
+The game is really similar to minecraft but really different at the same time. Its similar because you cut down trees, make tools with the wood you gathered, build a home, gather rocks, make tools out of rocks, gather iron, make tools out of iron and so on. But its different because now i can own a hand grenade and i'm fighting flying eyes.
+When you hold a torch in your hands it actually lights up the area around you. Unlike in games like Minecraft where holding a torch means you just hold a torch it won't light up an area until you place it on a block.

-Tutorial does not exist. You explore and learn on your own. Kinda like the earlier Minecraft versions i suppose. This is obviously not really good. Its been almost 4 hours and i still don't know how to make a bed.
-The nights can get a bit too chaotic. To the point where its better to just stay in your home for a while and wait for night to pass otherwise you'll be fighting 4-5 monsters at once. Its doable if you are careful you can beat them all but damn does it get overwhelming when they constant attack you wave after wave. You either spend the nights in your house doing nothing or in a cave exploring and mining.

Its not a bad game but its certainly not as good as people say it is. I'd recommend the game but at a discount. The full price, 18 Turkish Lira feels a bit too much for what i got out of the game."
18505,It's good but better with friends.
18506,fun with friends
18507,ruins friendships 10/10
18508,best game ever i fucking love it
18509,"I've been playing this masterpiece since 2014 when I bought it for the Xbox 360, I remember discovering the different biomes, items and bosses with my brother learning how to play and progress in the game, it gets more addicting the more you progress and learn the game. I guess now that I know almost everything about the game makes the experience a little sour, but it's always good to jump back and revive some childhood memories. Also, the crimson gave me nightmares and I was genuinely afraid of getting close to it (the music helped more than anything). [b] 10/10 if you play with friends (as long as they aren't some lil' bitches) and 9.6/10 if you play alone. :) [/b]"

18537,"Great Game, scratches that minecraft and cool loot itch."
18538,"terraria, como puedo descrivirlo, es mas que un ""minecraft en 2d"", es un gran juego que tiene mecanicas tan increibles y maravillosas que tiene sentido que sus rese√±as sean todas positivas, sin contar a los haters que siempre tienen cada juego. ademas los bosses y la progresion son sus fuertes porque aunque cada que progresas los jefes se vuelven un poco mas fuertes tambien existe una posibilidad de que si te la pasas esforzandote consigas equipamiento mas fuerte que el normal para ese momento haciendo las ganas de progresar mas fuertes ya que el matar a un jefe facilmente gracias a el esfuerzo del jugador es para algunos mejor que asesinar a los jefes estando debiles con habilidad y estrategia. en resumen terraria es un gran juego"
18539,e
18540,yes
18541,greatest game of all time no lie
18542,"this game is very fun and packed with gameplay. Then you add mods and there is like a whole new update but like, there isnt.
"
18543,e
18544,This isn't just 2D Minecraft (even though Terraria was released before Minecraft) This game has a lot to help it stand out and make itself known. Now sure 2D games may not be everyone's forte but if your looking at this game you probably will enjoy it. It also is vary fun building a world with some friends and beating all the bosses together.
18545,very based game 10/10
18546,"Back in spring of 2020, when the pandemic was just starting out, I bought this game. I'd seen some of my relatives play it previously, and I thought, ""Oh, what the heck, might be fun."" When I first started out, I thought it was just some cheap Minecraft clone. I gave up after a few hours, sticking with my other games. But later, about 2 weeks later to be exact, I started reading the wiki. Wow... this game is complicated. That was when I realized that this seemingly stolen game was much more than meets the eye. I spent hours building, mining and beating bosses. My tiny wooden house turned into a virtual city. What the heck, I even became friends with the NPCs. 
      After playing for a month or 2, the 1.4 update came out. I loved all of the new features, and soon made it to hardmode. Now, hardmode discouraged me for a bit, it being hard and whatnot, but I eventually got used to it. I chopped down those bosses left and right. When I had finally defeated all of the ""normal"" ones, it was time to fight the pillars. 
      I killed the lunatic cultist, brutally massacred the pillars, and immediately died when I reached the Moon Lord. Man, he was tough. Eventually I was able to beat him using a very specific strategy, and I obtained all of his end-game loot. But, I didn't feel like I was done yet. 
      For the next few months, I expanded my houses, making my NPCs happier about their surroundings. I got all of the hard-to-craft items, becoming extraordinarily overpowered. 
      I soon realized that I had spent about half of 2020 playing Terraria. And it was worth every second. 
      Now, two years have passed since I wandered through my city. My old world collects dust, covered in crimson. But I don't mind. Terraria made my year amazing. 
      So, if you heard about this little game called Terraria, don't hesitate to get it. It is absolutely incredible."
18547,Logged a couple hours - games pretty good

18703,better than minecraft in certain ways. more combat based and still good for building.
18704,Ive been playing this game for years. I probably have well over 700 hours on vanilla alone. It's an amazing game for those who love the pixel survival experience. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a challenge or just wants to waste their time
18705,"It's a fun game to sit down and play by yourself or with friends. The progression is somewhat linear even though there is no story, so you could do that or download some awesome mods as well."

18746,"This game truly deserves the labor of love award. I have been playing this game since around 2016 on an Kindle Fire. Ever since then I have enjoyed this game for just how fun it is to play. Out of all the games I have played this has been my favorite because of the sheer amount of things you can do. There is no one way to play it. If you want you can just relax, create a village, fish, that sort of thing. You don't need to do anything to progress if you don't want to. Most of the enjoyment I got from this game has been just from exploring the world, and discovering new items. I haven't even mentioned how good the music is yet. This game has some of the best music I have ever heard in a game. Games such as these are truly art, there are not very many games that have had this much love and passion put into them. I honestly believe my life has improved for the better because of this game."
18747,played a little don't know

Yes, Minecraft has interesting cave systems and an underground world to explore, but I like Terraria‚Äôs better due to the RPG elements."

18790,"A great game that has amazing devs that are always working their butts off and communicating with the player base and listening to them. I remember being a kid and arguing about whether minecraft was better or terraria ""TERRARIA IS A RIP OFF!"" ""YA?!?

18819,"Love spending 14 hours in a day trying to get an influx waver so that I can kill moon lord in about 25 seconds and subsequently just destroying every other boss I can find.
All in all good game spend 33 hours in three days on just grinding and crafting items so now I don‚Äôt really feel any debuffs"

18822,"h1One of the Best 2D Sandbox Games Out There/h1
Terraria is one of my most played games over many systems and I highly recommend it for those who like sandbox games. From PC to xbox360/ps3 to 3ds and now xboxseries/ps5, this game has been a wonderful experience that keeps myself and friends coming back to play it all over again.

Pros:
- World creation of different sizes, evils that inhabbit it, the set difficulty of enemies, and set seeds that will let you play the same world someone else was playing on youtube.
- Character creation that lets you personalize your character with different clothing, hairstyles, and scenarios for character difficulty resulting in some mere coins being lost upon defeat, or turning into a ghost to never arise again.
- A multitude of boss battles that unlock progression as you defeat them one by one (or decide to take on as many of them as you can).
- A slow, but steady progression through weapons, armor, accessories, and tools that gives a good feeling when you finally get that item more powerful then the one you have.
- Creativity is left to the player when building, designing, and planning for housing, bases, themed biomes, deadly traps, arenas, fishing, floating fortresses,... ok, lets leave it at lots of things to do in the world. Not only are there so much that can be built in the world, but a variety of blocks and background to use when building them. Imagination is key.
- Multiplayer. Who would'nt want to fight a giant mechanical worm with friends? You?! Oh, ok. Then just solo it, i guess.

Cons:
- Grinding will feel so long and wear down anyone's patience when trying to get an item they need. This is true to lots of items in the game were you could get an item from a slime that is such a low chance within your first 3 to 5 slimes, while it takes over 300 to get an item that has a 20% chance of dropping. It happens, but that is why it is called a grind.

This game is an open world sandbox that gives player the freedom to build, mine, fight bosses, and enjoy the company of friends or others. I highly recommend this game to those who like RPG, Sandbox, and Difficult games."
18823,Very game such a very great good. You are welcome.
18824,very gud

18832,"Possibly the other side of the ""Blocky build/mine"" coin, where as minecraft allows you to build almost endless amount of structures and other fun stuff, terraria sacrifices an entire dimensional plane to give you extreme progression, amazing combat, and actual lore. Also you won't find any trace of the Mothball dream whatever-his name is which is a massive relief.
also Cool game too"
18833,good
18834,"Its an awesome game for sure. I used to play when i was  little and now coming back to it, the nostalgia, its definitely worth it."
18835,"It's kinda mid, wouldn't put too many hours into this game tbh."
18836,its a wiki game but epic
18837,This game is amazingly sexy for the price.I dont know why all of my reviews contain the word SEXY.
18838,"Terraria is, put simply, one of the best games I've ever played. It has a ton of content, and a huge replay value to back it up, so you can play this game over hundreds of hours without getting bored. It's got pratically no story, but it keeps a sense of RPG-like progression as your character goes from a weakling who can't even beat a slime perfectly to an absolute god-slaying beast. The music is also really great, and the artstyle is retro but pleasant. About bugs, there's not a lot of them, really, and the game still gets bug fixes and some support even so many years after the initial release.

The only low points of this game are the weapon balance being somewhat poor in some parts of the game, and the random world generation sometimes fucking you up, but that's not relevant when compared to the good stuff of this game.
All in all, this game is honestly even cheaper than it should, and it's totally worth it, specially now that it's on sale."
18839,fun game but i have a small penis
18840,good
18841,"Lots of fun. Once you finish the game, Try Tmodloader."
18842,ely u suck
18843,veri coowl
18844,Es un buen juego aunque casi nunca lo juegue.Me la paso viendo videos y me gustan las mecanicas y los bosses pero no me dan tantas ganas de jugarlo por alguna razon.Quiza cuando este mas motivado lo juegue y lo disfrute como se debe XD.En conclusion me gusta al igual que el contenido de los mods que tiene pero no tengo la motivacion para jugarlo.
18845,"By far one of the best action/adventure games I've played.
There is so much content to unpack with 17 bosses (at the time of writing this) and tons of variety in weapons and armor.
In order to finish the game, it forces your world to be in ""hardmode"" making it harder to play but not TOO hard as other games do.

I may be biased about skill since I've played it for so long, but this game is definitely beginner friendly when playing in ""pre-hardmode"" (state of the world before hardmode) because it allows slow progression and for the player to get a good grip of the game.
I would 100% recommend to play this game.
Terraria also has a lot of replayability as well, yes I am referencing my play time.

(Note: If you're a Minecraft fanatic, this game has a LOT more content than Minecraft)"
18846,More like Terraria: White Supremacist Edition!
18847,"pretty fun game. Not at all the same game as minecraft. Much more exploration, adventure, and crafting in this."
18848,it took me a while to start playing but it turned out preaty fun ;D
18849,10 bucks is a great price 5 bucks is a steal
18850,10/10
18851,it is the best game
18852,best 2d game
18853,it gud
18854,Been playing Terraria on and off for years and its a really neat game. Got super excited for the new 1.4 update but when it was released I took a break and haven't gotten back into the game. Will do sometime in the near future and test out what new stuff they added. Also fun to mod aha
18855,yes
18856,Great game
18857,Does anyone know how to invite a zoologist on a date?

the enemies are not that hard but so fun to play with all the bosses are cool
and just yes"
18868,"so much things to craft,so much things to discover"
18869,Have you ever wanted to fight monsters of varying level? Have you ever wanted the satisfaction of teiring up and enchanting your armor to your endless variety of weapons? HAVE YOU WANTED THAT OPEN WORLD FEEL? UNIQUE SCENARIOS AND BOSSES? Well this has all of that and more. YOU DON'T NEED FRIENDS BUT IT'S COOL TO HAVE THEM WITH YOU. BUILD. PLAY. EXPLORE!

18912,"If You're into Minecraft or any other digging and open world-like games, You might like Terraria. Theres lots to do and explore many things might be tough but you can just go mining or kill other bosses or loot, armor, and even weapons. Decent amount of classes and you can even switch between all of them. Weapons may be very weak or very strong and thats about all I can say. Hope you enjoy if you try it!"
18913,game=very slay
18914,Its really amazing! The pixel art and story! Its very creative in many ways the exploration and building including the pvp and pve! would defo recommend!!!!!!!!
18915,very adicting
18916,"Uh, where do I start. Terraria has a very good game play multiple bosses , and while you are fighting these bosses you get the feeling, the heavy chest of anticipation of when you lose or not."
18917,this game is very fun and satisfying i really recommend this game if your into adventures and survival.
18918,"I played with friend it was fun although I wasn't prepared for corruption/crimson. I dislike the spread of it and the tedious way to prevent the spread, I kinda just map edited to make it manageable because we were surrounded on both sides and kept dying nonstop. Other than that it was solid 7/10 time with nice fighting variety and bosses"
18919,"IM FUCKING INVENCIBLE

Red sun
Red sun over paradise
Red sun
Red sun over paradise

Golden rays of the glorious sunshine

Setting down, such a blood-red light
Now the animals slowly retreat
To the shadows ‚Äì out of sight

Arid breeze blows across the mountains
Giving flight to the birds of prey
In the distance machines come
To transform Eden ‚Äì day by day

Only love is with us now
Something warm and pure
Find the peace within ourselves / Violence breeds within ourselves*
No need for a cure

When the wind is slow
And the fire‚Äôs hot
The vulture waits to see what rots

Oh how pretty
All the scenery

This is nature‚Äôs sacrifice

When the air blows through
With a brisk attack
The reptile tail ripped from its back

When the sun sets
We will not forget the
Red sun over paradise

Red sun"

18926,"This is the greatest game ever made, while the save the world game mode is lacking in replay ability it is still fun for a short time. The real main part of the game though, the battle royale is constantly changing with new updates and metas. Another thing that sets this apart from other battle royales is the game's high abundance of high quality cosmetics with affordable prices. Overall this is an amazing game with so much potential, can't wait for season 6!"

18963,"Terraria is a really fun, 2d explorer that is NOT a copy of minecraft, no matter what you say. It has a lot of progression inside the game and a lot of little things that you may not realize on your first playthrough. And, there are TONS of items, weapons, potions, nad quite a few bosses with around 12 being in the base game alone, plus if you DO buy terraria (which you should, just look at my hours) you get a free mod loader for terraria that allows you to play terraria with mods without needed to do a bunch of complicated stuff. 10/10 would highly recommend (it does get kinda slow at the start so don't get discouraged if you don't know what to do next, or if the progression is too slow at the start)"
18964,Fun game with over 5000 items so you will never be bored. Got it on sale for 5$ cad and its only 10$ regular price.

18979,enjoyable if you have extra time on your hands
18980,Awesome game. Really in depth story line. Basic game can have hours of fun solo or with friends. Also can install mods for endless amounts of fun and replayable bosses ans events. So cheap for such a good game. 10/10 would recommend.

19125,One of my favorite games ever
19126,good game
19127,"A very interesting survival game, this game is no less than Minecraft. It's the same as Minecraft, but it's a 2D version of the game. I really enjoy playing this game with friends because we can survive, explore, and even fight monsters together. We really liked the monster part because it was the most exciting part of the game in our opinion. After fighting the monster, we have a great sense of satisfaction. So, I highly recommend that if you have friends around you, you can play this game together, because this game is very suitable for playing with your companions. I'm very happy that this game won, and I also think this game deserves this award. Overall, I highly recommend this game because it brings us endless fun."

19137,it fun
19138,You feel the air getting colder around you...
19139,I liked the part when you fight stuff
19140,"Terraria is one of my favorite games on Steam, I've played it through several times, with and without mods, solo and with friends. I love the simple graphics, the 2D makes it easy to explore and see things, and there's a very nice gear progression locked behind not just new materials but also bosses and events.

This does however mean that if you're unable to beat the bosses needed to progress, you will be stuck there with no way of continuing. And yes, while that's the case of most games, some people prefer to just play these kinds of games for fun and relaxation. It's a fairly combat heavy game, so you need to constantly upgrade your gear in order to survive just exploring. There is a Journey mode that makes the game easier and you can change a lot of the aspects of the game to make it a more relaxed experience though, should you prefer to do so.

It's also very heavy on the modding side, but you need to use a separate program here on Steam to use it, meaning it won't progress any achievements, and at the time of writing isn't fully functional with version 1.4. But there are some amazing content mods that really changes up how the game is played with gear, classes, bosses biomes and more or less everything!

If you're looking for a Minecraft clone, this isn't it. There are far more to this game than Minecraft in terms of content and progression. It's more focused on the action part than designing and building, which is Minecraft's main selling point. Even though you obviously can do that here as well.

So yes, I 100% recommend this game if you like gathering materials to upgrade your gear so you can get better materials to get better gear until you beat the final boss and get the best gear. It might sound boring on paper, but if you like that kind of game play loop, it's very, very fun and satisfying. Especially with friends."
19141,Its like minecraft with more content! must play.
19142,honestly some of the most fun ive had in a while
19143,its great
19144,good
19145,"beautiful and amazing game. would recommend to anyone, all the time, forever"

19170,fart. ahahahahah
19171,Yea
19172,"Got Steam back in 2016 just to play this game, over my 120 hours its been one of the best games I've played which can be run on really any PC, It has incredible game play lasting many hours starting from the beginning where all is simple and easy until the late stages when every boss becomes a tactical nightmare to defeat, there is generally a grind to get the good items but for the most part the grinding is relatively engaging and challenging. The quantity of mods and features nowadays makes it much harder to run out of things to do compared to when I brought Terraria. I only stopped playing after my main world got corrupted which scarred me for life so if you have an unreliable potato pc then a backup is useful. This game like many is also better with friends and at this price which has changed little to none over the past 6 years is definitely worth the purchase."

19186,"I've put off actually completing the game for so long, and boy - I am glad I finally did it. The first half of the game really just feels like any other sandbox - a great one at that. But man, that second half... really is something to experience. Also, grinding for all achievements has been a blast. Only have the fishing quests left basically... should be fun. Lol."

19192,"let me tell you a tale of me and some friends. 

young adventurers fresh and bold we set out and dug holes and climbed hills. slowly we delved deeper, more tools, more powers, magic. to the very fires of the earth we dug and gained skills and power. we started by building doorless shelters and tiny makeshift homes, before we knew it, we built a town, an elevator to hell, a hell-o-vator if you will and i know i will. building towers into the sky we became masters of our world, no foe could stand before us, no force stop our will. 

this is a fun fucking game"

19211,"Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pok√©mon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok√©mon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3‚Äù03‚Äô tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they‚Äôre large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it‚Äôd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok√©mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more"

FINAL WORDS
Overall, one of the best games I've played. You can really tell how much love and effort has been put into this game, and it really shows how you do not need to be a triple A ultra realistic game to shine. Can not recommend this game enough! Props to the dev team!"

The game is poorly designed, the fact that it's still 2D in the year 2022 is beyond me, developers do not understand how important it is to keep up with the latest technology, because of this its decline is getting greater and greater. DO NOT PURCHASE! Go buy yourself a happy meal to get the toy, that brings way more enjoyment than this bollocks!"

19267,"Really enjoying this game.  A bit frustrating in the beginning when you're stuck in your house all night, but once you get past this the game really opens up.  Surprised at the depth of content. So many things to craft.  A very relaxing game, even on regular mode. (Journey mode is supposed to be even more chill.)  Die and reappear at the spawn point with all your stuff, minus the coins your were carrying.  (FYI that's what I don't like about Starbound- you drop most of our stuff, and without it can't fight your way back to reclaim it.)
Fans of Klei Game's ""Don't Starve!"" will love all the crossover content."

That's it, I've been playing it on mobile for the past 2-ish years, hard to keep track.
Now that I've got it on my laptop It just opened a whole buncha things for me, things became easier and the game became alot more fun, that also includes mods but I really haven't touched that area yet.

Overall, the game is great with it's replayability and near endless amounts of shenanagins and trolling you could do alone, and I haven't even mentioned multiplayer yet, just playing with a buddy or two makes things much more enjoyable, make it more than that? Enjoy the chaos >:) Like I said, good game, would really recommend it if you've been waiting/hesitating to buy it."

19364,"I have been playing terraria for a while now and it never failed to succeed in improving my expectations every time i played, i always found it a good game to play while travelling and just in general. It is fun however for early progression and sometimes on first play through you can get lost but the guide and multiple other npc's really help with crafting combat etc... sometimes though you have the problem where if you don't know the game you can get lost but there are so many upsides, for example having to do goblin army's and pirate invasions and solar eclipse add that randomness that if you don't know everything it can be really fun, i have over 100 hours in the game and unfortunately i haven't defeated final boss but i am hoping to get back into it"

19431,"I haven 't left my chair for 177 hours since I first downloaded this game. I now have blistering bed sores on my rectum due to my obese ass sinking into the chair. My shit and piss bucket is flowing over the brim and I don't believe I have the mental willpower to empty it. This game has destroyed my life, my wife has left me, my kids have starved to death due to my own personal negligence. The only time exit the games tab is to conversate with my fellow incels on Reddit about how all woman don't know a real man when they see one (like myself). I write this review not to inform you all about this game, but as a cry for help which will only echo in the eternal abyss. 10/10 will play again."

19434,"This game is currently on sale for ¬£3.49 but is ¬£6.99 at full price. This BAFFLES me as its an incredible game that has has years of free content added. You can currently buy 4 copies, 3 to give to friends or I'm assuming all 4 to give to friends for ¬£11.49 on sale and ¬£22.99 at full price. THIS ALSO BAFFLES ME. I would happily pay ¬£40 for just a single copy to play, let alone damn near half of that for 4 copies.

TL:DR, pick the game up if you haven't already. It's an incredible game at a confusingly cheap price."

19464,fun gameplay and progression within a charming sandbox environment that consistently receives love from the developers. A healthy community that provides new content and extends much of what is already there. A great experience that is certainly worth it for the replayability and cost. this really isn't a difficult decision if you don't have it already

19567,love the game payed all throughout my child hood
19568,"Possibly my favorite game of all time and definitely not a rip off of Minecraft. This game has so many bosses and items and will provide you with hours of fun with friends or just by yourself. The game might be intimidating at first, but as you play it you will become more and more used to the constant chaos that is this game."
19569,Amazing Gameplay Epic boss fights 11/10

19580,"kinda like minecraft, but in my opinion, not anywhere near as fun. it has wayyy more items and armor and gear, but the game is just not really fun compared to the other games i have. although this is just my opinion, and many people think this game is amazing."
19581,"This is a very fun game, more so with friends. I feel nostalgic when listening to some of the songs in the soundtrack despite only playing it on the PS4 before now."
19582,"I guess Terraria is okay if you like Minecraft but 2D, but my problem with that game is just that I cannot join my friend's servers no matter what. Maybe I'd consider playing it more if it just let me play online, It just simply will not let me, all of my friends can play online, but I'm the only one who can't. I don't know how to fix this problem, so maybe if someone could tell me, I would play it more. Because I'm considering refunding it."
19583,ffun and awsome
19584,grate game i have friends playing with me and it soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good this game
19585,is fun

19604,Terraria is often compared to Minecraft as the two have gone back since their early stages in development. The use of music and vast expanses often compete to Minecraft's unlimited world sizes and 3d textures. Where Terraria gets its complexity from also comes the vast underground of enjoyment with mods. After all the enjoyment of this came has served me years. It is a must have for me on nearly any platform.
19605,Lots to do and have fun with
19606,"I've beat this game 4 times, i class moon lord ass my wife. 
P.S. My ass burns."
19607,"Terraria lore:

1 minute playing = ""I don't even know how and where to begin :(""
1 hour playing = Start to look up tutorial on Youtube about how to defeat eye of cthulu
5 hours playing = Ends up exploring wiki for literral 1 hour to get best equipment/accesories
10 hours = *Start to enjoy every bit of gameplay
50 hours+ = Start to forget everything that exist in real life + inviting friends to join the game

19630,"Insanely fun game, hundreds if not thousands equipments to loot, find, craft, or even fished. Intense boss battles, various biomes and a whole myriads of enemies. You can build a magnificent base, be on a mission to cleanse the evil in your world, or just be a fishermen. Did I mention that this game also supports seamless multiplayer mode? MY only complaint is when it loads up new stuffs off screen, or you kill a new enemy, the game will froze for a while and then resumes."
19631,GOOD
19632,Its fun to play with friends
19633,fuck bats
19634,"Great game, hardly ever gets boring"
19635,:D
19636,yes
19637,you haven't bought it yet?
19638,I don't know where to start with this game. From the pure terror of fighting the bosses to seeing the end game being such a relief is so nice. A basic run down of the this game is you start of looking for materials to build a home then you continue crafting and beating bosses. Then once you kill the wall of flesh this game is completely different. From the pure skill gap in that area was so intense but so fun. My personal favorite thing about this game was beating the Moon Knight! That was such a blast knowing we had beat this game. Arguably one of the harder games I've ever played! The pure creativity that comes from this game is amazing! I think the average Minecraft enjoy-er would enjoy this game. I definitely recommend playing with friends its such a fun game to play with extra people. Me and my buddies all think this was a wonderful game and would definitely play this game again! I would have bought this game sooner if I had known of the amazing game aspects this brought to me. buy the game!!!!

19647,Very fun game
19648,good game
19649,"I'm just gonna say it: Terraria is probably one of the best games I've played in my lifetime. Not only is there so much to do, and so much to explore and see, it has an impressive soundtrack and unique gameplay to boot. The bosses are mostly pretty unique and have different attack patterns. I'd say the only downsides are the Lunar Pillars and sometimes ludicrous crafting recipes.

Definitely a must have for sandbox players."

Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Step 2
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

Step 3
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Step 4
To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.

Step 5
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving."
19770,"Idk what to say... The game is good but a little tedious at some parts. I've been playing for close to 2 weeks. The reason I write a bad review is because the saving feature is awful. After a week (and close to 40 hours of playtime) I bumped my leg into my wall socket, disconnecting my computer. This erased all of my progress and world once I rebooted my computer. I than started over and created a new world. I quickly surpassed my last player and world and was playing with a friend when all of a sudden, my game randomly froze and I was not able to access any other part of my computer. With no other option, I was forced to cut power to my computer. When I rebooted, my player had once again been corrupted. Luckily, I learnt my lesson and had backed up my player the night before, however I lost my excalibur and stormbow which I had played a lot today to acquire. My friend's entire player was corrupted and he will have to start over if he wants to keep playing, which he won't, because frankly it isn't worth playing this game when a random crash will take out all of your progress of the last 2 weeks. What Terraria should do is update the game so it there are 2 saves instead of just one. For example, if the game autosaves every 25 minutes, than there will be a save for the present, and one for 25 minutes ago that each update every 25 minutes. Basically saving the last autosave instead of writing over it. I understand that there is a backup save, but it saves at the same time as the main save, so when your computer crashes, the automatically created backup is corrupted too. 

Until changes happen, I do not feel comfortable reccomending this game to anyone."
19771,"my significant other bought this for me and I must say it absolutely blew me away. The depth of the game, the little tidbits of minor lore between characters, the awesome enemies, and oh dear sweet bippy the decor. Nothing better than a Rich Mahogany Bookcase. 10/10"

19797,WOW BEST GAME
19798,"This game is amazing, its one of the best games that i can always go back to, New builds, Weapons, Ideas, layouts, and challenges are always right around the corner. The Game is overall one of the games that no matter what i feel like i can go back to it over and over again.  I would 1000/1000 recommend especially with friends!"

19812,It good
19813,Good
19814,"This game has so many different play styles in the different classes: Melee, Ranged, Summoner, and Mage. Even within those classes you can specialize. Play Terraria for a sense of exploration and satisfaction from beating the many cool bosses. My only criticism is after the final boss there isnt much to do."
19815,"I have played this game for years and finally decided to try it on pc. I played for about 15 hours on a save just for it to randomly say error and no longer work. I haven't been able to fix it, nor has the internet been able to help me in my endeavor. It's so extremely frustrating and honestly sad that this happened. Great game but still soul crushing."
19816,"This game is one amazing, one of a kind, game. It has so much to discover that the game never seems to end, and with friends it can all be done multiple times. While it can be a bit difficult to know what to do or how to do things you can find all the help online. And changing ""class"" is so easy and I love not having to create a new character to change my style. And the possibilities to either build, explore or fight enemies makes the game very enjoyable. I highly recommend Terraria!"
19817,"Wow. What an amazing game. However, as much as I try,  i will never be as good at this game as my friend Albi. He is possibly the biggest alpha male I have ever met. I am forever grateful just to have been merely in the presence of this absolute menace. The best Terraria player of all time Albi

19818,amazing game. unfortunately not cross-platform but still a very fun adventurous game. It does get boring when your trying to get a specific item though. Still 10/10.

19847,"Played this one for a long time using a pirated copy. Finally bought the game because its way too good, and the recent updates are incredible.

This game is an absolute and timeless masterpiece, and for this price, even without a sale, it is 100% worth it; If you read the description, know what it is about, and think you'll like it, go ahead and buy it with no regrets."

19926,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

One, moonlord is too weak for my liking, I can easily kill him with the last pillar even on master mode. Two, I bet lots of people have commented about this but, GOLEM IS SOOOO WEAK! His attacks aren't too weak but it's so easy to avoid them, just fly left and right and repeat. Overall awesome game and the credits actually hit me hard at the end, almost started tearing up lol. And I hate when people compare this game to Minecraft, it's totally original and has lots of unique items, blocks, pets, and enemies. When making this, I have played this game for exactly a total of 436 hours!"
20019,fun game especially with friends
20020,morbius
20021,This is the 4th time I've bought this game. Hopefully that gives you an idea of how good it is.
20022,"Hello People of Steam i have bought this Game and Played through it, I must say i Enjoyed myself alot while playing it, The exploration and the Gameplay is very Nice and enjoyable. For a Casual Gamer that just wants a Good singleplayer Exploration Game, This is a great choice. For some more Competitive players there's the multiplayer Section where you can Play on server that have Mini-Games, Special Events and other stuff. 

On the Topic of Multiplayer This game is so much more enjoyable with 2 to 4 Friends. All of the Bosses in this Game are great and fun to fight against. The progression isnt Confusing and very simple, most of the Achievements also give you clues on what to do next. Building in Terraria is also a Great thing you can do, The Blocks, Paints and other stuff that you can use to your advantage to make your buildings look nice and stylish. To say this is a great game is an understatment as this game is a Masterpiece. All i can say is I recommend this game if you love exploration and survival Games!

Enjoy Terraria
Kind regards -Hyden"

20033,Gg
20034,"this game is amazing i love the variety of cosmetics and the bosses and just how many things and items there are in general this game has so much detail put into it and a lot of people would say that it doesn't but once you play for a bit the game is definitely worth it for the amount you pay. this is such an addicting game and from the beginning it takes about 10-20 hours to complete- and my computer is about 10 years old and not the best but this game can run completely smoothly on it. there is so many items to choose from and so many choices to build it can be quite challenging from time to time and sometimes i feel like quitting but honestly this game has so many things included and I know I'm not able to talk about all of them in this review but i would say two things- one is that the customization options at the beginning of the game when you first make your character are not the best but it doesn't matter too much because it isn't going to show later in the game, another thing, the death screen- ITS WAY TO LONG like you actin like we got all the time in the world- bruh we don't! lol sorry ^^ but the death screen can take anytime between 10-30 seconds and THAT IS WAY TOO LONG FOR ME! I DON'T WANNA WAIT THAT FRIKKIN LONG! sorry- again and iv'e been a 6 year steam veteran and the very first game i got was Terraria, in fact i played that game the same day i made a steam account and ill have to say- you should definitely buy this game honestly i highly recomend it- 5 stars- *chef kiss* well bye have an awesome day :]"
20035,When you first play have 500 wiki pages open
20036,great game

20063,this game is so boring
20064,bussin
20065,a little hard to learn but overall good game
20066,some of the most involved and loving creators for any game ever
20067,Its a good game don't start in master mode
20068,"Hands down one of the greatest games ever created.
Simple to learn, hard to master.
Constant updates from a small-ish team.
Beauty in it's colour, sprites, boss mechanics.
I remember when this came out and i couldn't find legal copies anywhere, it was still a relatively obscure game at the time.
Spent hours upon hours building platforms for boss fights."

20071,This game is so cool its so awsome it would be the coolest superhero movie you've ever seen

20081,"I started Terraria back before freshman year of 2016. I've had multiple great memories of this game with my brother. From defeating Plantera, the Wall of Flesh, and to our very first boos of the Eye of Cthulu; these are memories that I wouldn't trade for the world. There is one thing that you can take away from this review, it's that this game is the greatest pass time if you find people as dedicated as you. I also hate this game with a passion because fuck the fisherman kid and his stupid ass achievement of TWO HUNDRED FUCKING FISHES. Fuck that dude. Love this game, highly recommend!"
20082,lol
20083,block game fun
20084,"""ThiS gAme iS JUsT 2d MINecrAfT""
No it is very much not my friends. This game is arguably better than Minecraft in every way. And this is coming from someone who owns both games. 
Terraria is a very fun experience that rewards good strategy (or just good enough luck) with awesome and zany weapons and accessories. The game has over 15 bosses so you'll always be looking forward to something. Also, with over 4000 items to collect and experiment with, you are basically playing the ultimate sandbox game. The game progression is nice and really kicks up in hardmode. You think Skeletron is hard? How bout fighting Skeletron PRIME. Hardmode is the second half of your adventure and the difficulty ramps up signifigantly. The final boss is also a nice way to end your adventure after many trial and errors later. 
Also, Re-Logic just keeps adding new stuff, despite saying many times they are done adding stuff to the game. So this game has longevity."

20092,"There is so much to do in Terraria! You can grind for achievements, race for a speed-run, build massive creations, and so much more. It even has some hard challenges to accomplish along the way with plenty of boss fights and seasonal events. I have played this game for years and I always have something to do while I play. I fully recommend this game to anybody who likes a challenge and a good adventure."

20114,"ive played this game since i was very young, when me and my brothers shared a steam account we had over 300,000 hours total i remember when you could only have a certain amount of worlds and characters and how my brothers would always make sure there wasnt any space for me, this game is wonderfully crafted i may not be very good but that doesnt stop me from enjoying the game. I love what the developers did with mod support it is by far the most consumer friendly thing i have seen in years. im pretty sure my brother got mounts added to the game aswell (he sent a letter)"
20115,nice game
20116,My absolute favorite game of all time! It was the first game i bought off steam actually! 200/10
20117,very fun and good yes
20118,"Terraria is a two dimensional (2D) sandbox platform with lots of weapons, items, people, non-playable characters (NPC's).  There is a variety of thing to do in the game like fishing, building, Player Vs. Player (PVP), fishing and more. The graphics are excellent for a two dimensional (2D) game and easy on the eyes. The System Requirements very low as well so you can play the game smoothly on almost every system. The game also gets tons of updates at a great pace. There is no story to the game sadly but great lore to read that makes up for the story if you are interested in that kind of thing. There are also a variety of mods made by the Terraria community to play on the Tmodloader. Even I am still playing Terraria to this day even after completing the entire game like lots of people. Mods such at Calamity, Overhaul, Thorium, and every mod brings lost of thing to the party. I would also recommend looking at the Terraria community section for more stuff to see such as builds, videos, Guides and such. Speaking of the Terraria community, is still very much active ever since 2011 when the game came out."
20119,"Me and my friends didn't play terraria in a very very long time and we decided to come back to see a lot of new things. my friends was like ""Damn, it's been years since we played terraria. Let's play on the hardest difficulty."" I was like ""What?! Why?!"". And he just goes ""Why not?."" And it's changing the whole entire game when you played on the hardest difficulty. It was a lot more fun, more stress, more funnier. You'll find a lot of ridiculous things. Like what happened to me, i was on full health and almost die because of ONE FREAKING SLIME, A FREAKING SLIME. How ridiculous is that. Or when i was mining, and i found a chest. and when i open the chest, BOOM. EXPLOSION. And since you're playing with your friends, it just become something funny, something to laugh it off."
20120,its a damn good game.  10/10

20140,After 277 hours I finally 100% this game. I don't try to do that with a lot of the games I play. This game is absolutely amazing when you're playing it by yourself. It is challenging but not so challenging that it doesn't become fun anymore. This game is also even better with friends because it just adds to the chaos and fun of terraria. I recommend this game very heavily.

20207,"This game is the embodiment of unfair bullshit, it seems at every fucking turn the developers just wanted to make the player suffer for no good reason at all. I don't understand how anyone can find this game fun. I also have no fucking clue why this game IS SO FUCKING ADDICTIVE, seriously, why the hell do I keep finding myself returning to this game even though it's nothing but pure suffering? I can't understand it. But yeah, unless you're a massive masochist, I can't recommend this.

this game is better than a lot of games 5x as expensive, and is very fun to play. No matter what your playstyle is, terraria has the experience for you.

20290,"If you go to the jungle and encounter a Derpling or Giant Flying Fox, there is a 2.5% chance (across all difficulties) that the mobs drop some GRAPES........

The use time is 17 (Very Fast), it gives a medium improvement to all stats and increased life regeneration for 16 minutes. The GRAPES can also be sold for 40 silver coins........

2 GRAPES, a bottle and a cooking pot can create one GRAPE Juice. The GRAPE Juice use time is 17 (Very Fast), it gives a major improvement to all stats and increased life regeneration for 16 minutes. The GRAPE Juice can also be sold for 80 silver coins........

Fun Fact:
Despite real-world grapes being clearly a fruit, Grapes in Terraria do not fit into the Fruits category. They cannot be used to craft Fruit Juice or Fruit Salad, are not dropped from Trees, and both they and their juice give far better buffs than the members of that category. Also, researching Grapes requires 10 of them, unlike all the other fruits that require only 5........

Overall, very good game.
I give it 10/10 Pinot Noir's

6. Use the house tool (the question mark icon) to find caves

7. The cloud house things in the sky are useful

20353,"A masterpiece of 2d art and gameplay. No real story but it is made up for by the overall gameplay. Amazing progression without any major difficulties, and has plenty of secrets and achievements to offer! If I were to not buy this game, I would probably have nothing to do for the past while. Although I haven't beaten it, I have still watched hundreds of videos on challenges that were unknown to me. If you asked me what I disliked about this game, I would mainly say that the grinding for fighting bosses in expert and master mode is quite tedious. However, I would still rate this game a 9.8 out of 10!"

I also got like 297 grenades and used them as much as I pleased. I am satisfied with my Terraria playing experience and probably will not spend any more time in it. Thank you to those who created this game."
20368,Really fun! Lots of action with amazing boss encounters and various land and character customizations. 10/10
20369,i haven't played this game properly for years its really cool to see what i missed when i was playing it as a 9 year old and also what they've added! very fun very cool would recommend.
20370,"Imagine what Minecraft might be like if it had been made with pixel art sprites and released in the SNES era. That sums up the overall vibe of Terraria pretty well. It also explains why I just can't seem to tear myself away from the darned thing. This devious little indie sandbox title borrows so many ideas from Notch's game that it essentially is Minecraft in 2D, but it also beefs up the familiar gameplay in exciting ways. There's a lot more creepy crawly stuff to kill, and the staggering number of doodads you can MacGyver together into deadly weapons to slay them with is mouth-watering. Say what you will; there's some gnarly fun to be had in these uncharted depths.

After you're done customizing your sprite character, Terraria dumps you on the colorful surface of a randomly generated pixel world with nothing more than a handful of tools and the vague sense that you're meant to build stuff, explore the terrain, and battle monsters. Figuring out exactly how that's done is a little puzzling at first. There's a lone guide wandering around the surface, though his advice is random. The lack of a tutorial meant I had to consult the game's Wiki page to get a better sense of how things work and what can be built. Even so, it didn't take long to get the gist. Though there aren't any real story elements or epic quests to conquer, the strong fantasy trappings instill a desire to adventure nonetheless. There's magic, monsters, and mayhem waiting both on the surface and in the dark caverns below. Uncovering unexpected new prizes and perils is a big part of the game's charm.

The entire game world is destructible, and breaking block lets you collect core resources like stone, wood, and iron that can be used to make cool gear or build structures. Rarer resources are dropped when you slay skeletons, floating fanged critters, and other monsters or when you dig deeper into the subterranean underworld. Since such a large portion of Terraria's gameplay revolves around foraging for different components and seeing what you can build with them, the drive to explore every nook and cranny of the landscape kicks in right away. But it's important to temper your desire to set out exploring in hopes of amassing huge quantities of loot with the pressing need to build shelter and expand your spawn point's home base.

Life on the surface follows a day/night cycle. Exploring topside during the daytime is safer ‚Äì you can pick flowers, roam around, chop trees, and kill weak slimes that roam too close. It's also a perfect time to build houses that serve as shelter and attract helpful NPC characters to your settlement. Things get dicey when night falls; zombie hordes and floating eyeball beasts come out in droves, forcing you to fight or flee. That's less of an issue once you get a sturdy settlement started.

The village development aspect of the game is a clever addition ‚Äì once you discover it exists. You can throw together bare-bones shacks or craft elaborate fortresses that tower upward into the heavens. Either way, you want to deck them out with enough accoutrements to lure NPCs to your village. These support characters can heal you, sell you items, and offer other helpful services. You have to complete a specific task to attract them, and even then they only appear if you've created a room (complete with walls, furniture, lighting, etc.) for them to stay. This offers some tangible incentives to spend time building, beyond the desire to lord over a large stronghold.

Having an elaborate and ever-expanding home base to return to on the surface is satisfying. However, the dark, foreboding underworld is where the real action is. Everything you need to make the most basic items like torches, furniture, and healing potions can be found near the surface, but you have to adventure deep below to uncover the rarest materials. This is where Terraria's gameplay feels more like an old-school action platformer and where it really sunk its hooks into me. Digging for ore eventually uncovers sprawling caverns that are home to many varieties of creepy creatures. Giant slimes, skeletons, burrowing worms, and tougher beasties roam the dark, and they often come charging at you while you're excavating. Exploring is a lot fun on its own, yet it's the strong emphasis on combat that's really appealing. For one thing, stopping to battle monsters breaks up the monotony of digging. Creatures also drop coins that can be used to buy shop items. There's an added risk versus reward element to combat too. Getting killed causes you to re-spawn on the surface with your gear intact, but you'll leave a chunk of your precious coin stash behind.

The real impetus behind adventuring is driven by the insanely deep gear crafting system. Almost everything you pick up in the game is a component used in forging some crucial piece of kit. There are well over a hundred different weapons and items to build. Though some equipment is more functional ‚Äì like protective armor, grappling hooks that lets you navigate with greater ease, and treasure chests for storing loot ‚Äì most of the stuff designed for cleaving monsters into itty bits is just sheer badass. Magical boomerangs, laser pistols, spell books that shoot fireballs, light sabers, and ninja stars are just a handful of the crazier weapons you can build. Hunting down the rare items you need to build the best weapons is obsession forming.

A few other cool nuances enhance the absorbing tasks of exploring, building, and battling away. Journey to the farther reaches of the surface world, and you'll inevitably run into The Corruption ‚Äì a teeming mass of demonic turf filled with extra danger and extra rewards. You'll also uncover demonic altars for forging special items that can be used to summon one of the game's three spectacular bosses to fight (sporting awesome names like ""Skeletron"" and ""Eater of Worlds""). Terraria's multiplayer mode is a blast too. Co-operatively exploring and building with friends or strangers is even more enjoyable than going solo, depending on the folks you play with. Finding an open public server to play on is a real drag, since most fill up within minutes of being posted on the game's forum. The good news is you can create your own server and share it with your pals (or post it online for others to join)."

20389,"Whatever you think, its not 2D Minecraft. The only similarities is that they are pixelated sandbox games you can play with friends. That is where similarities stop, because Terraria has, in my opinion, much better replayability, along with dozens of hours of fun per world. So many unique bosses and events to fight and conquer, hundreds of enemies, and NPCs, which bring life to the world all having personalities and unique trades based on game progression. Overall, 10/10 game, definitely not just 2D Minecraft."

20423,"It was a dark, cold, lonely night, me and the guide were trapped in a small dirt house while zombies knocked on our door.
I sat in my corner playing with my balls, my slime balls, waiting for death. Then guide walked on over next to me, he reached out and grabbed my balls, my slime balls, asking if he could eat my balls, my slime balls he wanted to feast. I tell him no, but he forced himself onto me trying to steal my balls, I tried to push him away, I pushed, I pushed but he was not letting go of my balls, my slime balls.
I gave up and let go of my balls, my slime balls. Seeing my beautiful blue balls in another man's hands brought a tear to my eye. But that tear was not a sad tear, it was a god damn vengeance tear!
Because the guide tripped over the crafting table while eating and started to chock on my balls, my slime balls, I got up and pulled out my wood and jammed it down his throat! Forcing my wood deeper into his filthy hole!
Watching the life fade from his eyes as my ball juices leaked from his mouth, trying desperately to get me off but to no avail. He died chocking on my balls with my wood deep in his throat. 
As I lay there in my ball juices next to a dead body to keep me company, I see a light shining through the cracks of the door, I get up and braced my self for the worse, I open the door with my eyes shut scared to see what was on the other side.
But nothing happened, I slowly opened my eyes to see why death has not come sooner, to be blinded by the sun and all of its beauty, ""By god, I made it through the night"" I said quietly. 
Not a single monster in sight, only rabbits, worms, and birds, as far as thee eye can see. I turned around to shut the door but I noticed the body was gone, I walk back in looking in every 2 corners of the house to find nothing.
Suddenly, cold shivers go up and down my spine like there's something in side telling me something is wrong, I can feel someone watching me, I turned slowly to look outside and there he was. The guide standing there looking at me.

20427,"I've played this for like 6 years

20428,"I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don‚Äôt expect to be forgiven. I‚Äôm simply here to apologize.

What we came across in the woods that day was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through.

There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry.

I want to apologize to the internet. I want to apologize to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologize to the victim and his family.

For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. I don‚Äôt deserve to be defended. My goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world I live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious.

Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don‚Äôt expect to be forgiven, I‚Äôm just here to apologize.

I'm ashamed of myself. I‚Äôm disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you."

20432,its good
20433,good game.
20434,"why do i hear boss music?

This is probably one of the most fun games I ever played. The amount of content this game is still getting even after over a decade after its release is incredible, this game deserved the Labor of Love award, more than any other game. 

Content: 9/10 There is so much content in this game. You'd probably need a guide to figure out what to do. Even if you did run out of content, you can get T-mod loader on Steam for free and get popular Terraria mods like Calamity and Thorium or make your own. You can also download maps and resource packs from the Steam Workshop. 

Soundtrack: 9/10 has probably one of the best OSTs ever. Heck even the tutorial theme is good. I won't say more about the soundtrack because I think you should see it for yourself. 

Gameplay: 8.5/10. Gameplay is very enjoyable overall. However, be aware that the game is very hard at the beginning. Your character will probably die... a lot! The game eventually gets easier, until you reach Hardmode. Although, just like the beginning it will get easier, as you get stronger gear and weapons. The game is also very grindy which some people may like and others may not. It's entirely up to personal preference. For example, some weapons like the Rod of Discord have incredibly low drop rates. 

Controls: 8/10 The controls are very good and if you do not like them you can navigate to the settings menu and change them yourself. 

Story: The game doesn't really tell you the story. If you want some story, you will probably need to look up the official Terraria lore online. I haven't really read the lore though, so you should probably check it out yourself.

Length: You could play this game for ages, thanks to the amount of content, the community, and the ability to build whatever you want. Length 10/10

Bugs and glitches: This game has quite a few bugs and glitches from when I played. For example, You can cheese some bosses such as the Dungeon Guardian and the Moon Lord. You can also duplicate items too. 

Best of all, the system requirements are so low that you could run this on a dirt cheap laptop.

Overall, an incredible game that everyone should play at least once. Hopefully Terraria will get content for years and years to come.

20435,"I know you've probably heard this a million times, but it really is like Minecraft but 2D. It's still got the same sense of exploration, although there's a little bit more world building involved - not in the sense of actually building things, but with different NPCs and multiple bosses and the such. I've been having tons of fun with it ever since I've started playing it. If you like Minecraft for its exploration, then I 100% recommend you try out Terraria as well."
20436,"It's an amazing game. The general gameplay is awesome and well balanced, as well as the fact that instead of having individual worlds, you can have huge campaigns that span across many worlds."
20437,w GAME

20447,yep
20448,moon lord caused the great depression.

20455,"This is literally one of the greatest games I have ever played in my entire life. I love the concept and the adventures. And for one, I am a person who loves to grind in these kinds of games. This game is very nostalgic and I play it every now and then, HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!"
20456,veryggod
20457,"SOOO FUN, so many things to discover, the weapons are really varied and cool as well as the movement accesories like master ninja gear, the bosses are fun to fight especially the cultist  and progression happens at a smooth pace. Definitely a game i'd recommend :)"
20458,"Even if I only played for 4 hours, it felt like 400 hours, 10/10 game"

20462,Really nice game love it
20463,"my life was miserable ever since I was born, I wasn't doing well in school, my parents hated me, I had no friends and got 0 hoes. but recentley I was enlightened, I discovered this game for a measley 5 sheckels and the experience changed my life, now I'm scoring straight 11/10s, my parents finally love me, I have friends and get all the hoes."

20469,"Funny and has stuff to  do 
"
20470,"LOTS TO ENJOY
"
20471,good game had fun
20472,"Sandbox game with buttloads of content, not to mention the modding community is great too! You want to build? BAM! You want to fight enemies and bosses with different classes? BAM! Looking for eastereggs or hidden structures? BAM! It's all there. 10/10"
20473,"Great game, full of humor and things to do. Weapons galore, enemies galore, places to go galore. Plenty of lore too."
20474,"I would say that this would have to be one of my favorite games on steam, I've been playing Terraria in a whole since about 2014 when my brother and I got it for mobile. Then we switched to Xbox 360 edition, and a few years later I picked it up once again with some pals. This game never gets old with other people, especially if you all choose different classes.

The developers are humble as well as work hard; There isn't an major update to date that doesn't have something new to shake up playstyles. Props to Redigit and the rest of the mod team for creating and maintaining this masterpiece for so long, and going out of your way to make the game as polished and beautiful as possible. Not only that, opening the workshop and having your own modloader published, free with a copy of Terraria.

Unfortunately the game isn't perfect, it has a slow start to play in-game and can be a little laggy and resource intensive out-game. Though they have gotten better about optimization, that might just be my computer being a potato.

All-in-All, a good 10/10 for a nice adventure with friends."
20475,"I had a lot of fun playing this game on my first play through, in 16 hours I still haven't even managed to start the second part of the main game (hard mode), and I've constantly been finding new things to do, new enemies to spawn, new places to explore, and more challenges to overcome, I highly recommend this game for both casual and veteran gammers alike."

20514,"I am a 46 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 15. My son recently started Terraria and in less than a week, he had already played for over 35 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Youtube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories."
20515,its a fun sandbox what else do you need?

20520,"Terraria is a Open World Survival Sandbox 2D game that never gets old. Having to defeat all the bosses and craft your way up to infinity is very fun yet challenging. Terraria will always be a staple video game and will always have a player base that never dies. For only $10.00 this game give you so much content that you have to try. Playing this game with mods makes the experience great, but joining with friends makes it greater. 10/10üî•"
20521,good
20522,didnt they say they would stop updating this game
20523,Very fun. Lots of time wasted at this game and i dont regret any of it!
20524,"I love this game with a burning passion, its one of the best games I have played in years to come, multiplayer is real fun and new and almost every world you play on is different, if you want to get it i highly recommend you do."
20525,"Good, But sometimes playing this game makes you want to rip out someones skull."
20526,I would reconmend this but i lost a charater that i spent 18 hours on

20528,sold my soul - worth it
20529,yes
20530,"This is why you should play Terraria in 2022

If you haven‚Äôt already dug deep into Terraria, 2022 is the perfect time to start.

Thanks to more than a decade of constant development, Terraria has become an icon of online gaming. The open-world game has a polished gameplay loop around exploring, crafting, and challenging difficult boss fights. All of that takes place in a randomly-generated world that changes as the game progresses.

If you‚Äôre interested in picking up Terraria in 2022, here‚Äôs everything you should know.

What is Terraria?
Terraria is a procedurally-generated sandbox game built around exploration and combat. Players start with very basic tools and weapons with the goal of improving their strength to take on new areas. Terraria features a very in-depth biome system, which includes designated evil zones including a hell layer. Unlike similar games, Terraria features dozens of boss fights meant to challenge the player and gate progression.

A major selling point of the game is its massive amount of content. From its release in 2011 to 2022, Terraria has gone through over a decade of content additions and adjustments. There are dozens of ways to improve characters and thousands of items to collect and craft.

If the single-player content ever gets boring, Terraria fans can host online worlds to team up with friends and take on the world together."
20531,fun game
20532,It's Terraria you already know its good
20533,gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
20534,GAME IS = GOOD
20535,"As a person who has beaten this game, this is definitely my favorite game ever made. It's grindy, but it's fun grindy. If you're not into games where you're constantly collecting something, then this game is not for you. Tons of bosses, items, enemies, biomes, structures, THE BEST GAME SOUNDTRACK I HAVE EVER HEARD, awesome mods,  and npcs. This game constantly makes you do something or have some sort of task, like protecting your world from a spreading biome, or collecting ores to make better gear and fight a boss, or building more rooms for npcs to move into. This game has everything, and a price so low it should be illegal. And there's also a gun shaped like a shark, it's pretty kewl."

20537,"i hate - angler, blood moons, voodoo demons, bats, chaos elementals, rod of discord, chaos elementals, the underground hallow, chaos elementals, and the rod of discord (took me 100+ hours to get)
"
20538,Compared to most games in 2022 if you get a few friends or maybe just yourself you can have endless hours of fun because of the RNG just like Minecraft. 10/10 solid game
20539,ae
20540,Terraria is a very fun game that offers a lot of content and is hard to 100% like most games. It offerds a variety of weapons for each of it's four classes.

20559,"This game is simply a masterpiece. It's incredibly fun, there is so much to do, and it has a great balance between getting more skill to survive longer and thinking outside the box to overcome difficult situations, whether that be fighting a challenging boss in the whackiest but effective way possible or trying to get more money. It is an action-packed sandbox where you can make incredible buildings & structures or intricate contraptions to kill your friends.
There is this one teeny tiny issue about this game that I can't ignore though...

20565,"      Once I was a damned fool. I roamed the earth in neglect of Terraria, believing that Minecraft made this game invalid. What an incredibly brainless understanding of the world I had. This game will make your teeth fall out, and you wife divorce you. There is no game that has such a perfect difficulty loop as terraria. Just when you start to feel powerful, a new boss or event shoves dirt in your eyes and calls you ""gregort."" Insane stuff."

20592,This game is fun and great for a 2D game. It can be hard at times but over all it's really good. I like to build and this game allows you to. It has a lot of blocks and dyes to use so you can build as much as you can.

20598,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
20599,"Good game, in my opinion really worth of buying. Nice to grind when you got the hang of it and really fun to play alone or with Friends"

20628,"This is a great game! The way I first discovered Terraria was through StampyLongHead (aka Stampy) I first played back in 2018 on the Xbox 360 edition. It was awesome! Then, in 2019, I got the Xbox 1 version. This was even better! So much more content and such. Now, in 2022, I bought it for my new pc. It's still fun to this day!"

20630,"I can't say that I don't think you would enjoy this game, but if you don't enjoy complicated games then I believe this game may not be the right game for you. I haven't fully played this game, but from all that I have played of the game, I think that it is way too much for my brain to handle. I know a friend who really enjoys Terraria, and he would tell me all about how to beat the bosses and how to progress in the game but every time he would try and help me it would just travel through my ear and out. I think with friends this game can actually be pretty fun if you are willing put in many hours to defeat the bosses, get all the acheivements done, and lose all your friends because you spend 700 hours on the game."

Anyway I'd recommend it as it makes a lot of fun and you can always focus on building instead of progressing."

20719,Alota Things To Do. Cool
20720,"yeah, I sound like everyone else but this is genuinely one of if not my favorite game of all time, and a damn good one at that. Combining steam, T mod loader and various consoles I have spent at least 300 hours of my life in this game and I don't regret a single minute of it. even though I've played it a very long time (since at least 2017) I've probably only tapped into 45-50% of the games content, not to mention the unfathomable amount of replayability too, I really can't think of a game you can play as long as I have and still learn and find new things. seriously one of the best games of all time for sure."
20721,"This is such an amazing game.

While some might compare it to Minecraft, in my opinion, this game isn't about the creative building - though you can still make beautiful structures.

No, what I really love about Terraria is the exploration, the way you improve your gear over time, to overcome the bosses and monsters the game throws at you. And the game is really smart about it, too - there are ways for you to manually summon the bosses, but events will happen automatically over time to nudge you in that direction.

Great, whimsical soundtrack. Tons, and I mean TONS of content and references. Well worth full-price. Go from a doofus to wielding the powers of a demigod."

Prepare to die a lot!! but that where the fun is.

Right now I started master mode and get addicted... and I even haven't get to hard-mode...

20770,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

20784,"The ""Do you recommend this game?"" message has been there for a while so I might as well finally write something.

This game is incredible. Never have I played a game with a progression system quite like this one. It'll make you feel powerful one moment and completely weak the next while never feeling completely unfair. The weapon choices are amazing. The backgrounds are fantastic to look at. The building may seem limited at first but I can tell you from seeing a friend, it'll can take you less than a week to build something stellar. Customizing your character in a world is surprisingly easy (and fun as heck) with the dyes. The bosses are great while a little easy sometimes. The multiplayer aspect is great fun and watching them die in different ways from the chat alone is just hilarious. I could keep going on and on but I think I'll just summarize it with:

It's not just ""2D Minecraft"", it's a whole other experience entirely. A fantastic one."

20863,Amazing Game So Cheap the best 2d game ive ever played i never want it to die  it has so many possibilities for it mods more updates all of it
20864,"Played for 3 days straight, its meh"
20865,Finally got all the achievements.
20866,"sartting off, this is a great game if you have not ever played it, and even if you have I still recommend the PC version. This game is great because it has almost 90+ acheivements, 480+ tools and weapons to collect, 16 bosses and minibosses and tons of different armors and vanity items. Because of this and its wide range of possibilities for character customization it has lots of replayability and paths you can go down, not including the extra difficulty and extreme riches of expert mode, and the hardcore and mediumcore (where you drop all items on death) options for characters. Not only above and the several hours you could spend killing bosses, collecting items, and achievement hunting, there are also many amazing buildings you can make with a wide variety of blocks, and also has a large mechanical system with which you can make circuits and traps of sorts. My last and (probably biggest for those who have friends to play with, I give you all of my F's on my keyboard if you do not) is the co-op. This games co-op is amazing, with friends the possiblites are endless, exploring every cave, taking on hordes and armys together, defeating bosses and then becoming powerful enough to beat them quickly, and making amazing builds and other creations becomes possible, and that is why I heavily recommend this game, with it only being ten dollars.+"
20867,"This game has been my entire life, it is THE greatest game I have ever played. My father bought me the game for XBox 360 around six years ago, to this day, this is my most played game in my entire life. Yes, I may have stopped playing on the 360, but I have it on Steam now. You could combine all of the hours in all of my games and Terraria would probably have double the that amount, to an exact point, I have been playing this game for 5,235.4 hours in total. 5,235.4 hours is equal to over 200 days! I love Re-Logic for making this game, Thank you!"

20878,"its good
"
20879,"Terraria is a game which seems to be not interesting, but as you go further into progression, it only gets better and better. Terraria is an open world game which has a whole lot of enemies to encounter as well as bosses and NPCs. There are multiple difficulty modes to master and secret seeds to play and if you've done everything, that isn't the end as Terraria has a seperate game called tModLoader which is terraria, but with mods, it's almost as if it's a nearly endless expansion pack with all the possibilities."
20880,good game
20881,i mean its alright i guess
20882,yea its good
20883,It's just good fun.
20884,Terraria's cool
20885,yes
20886,so good
20887,"Terraria is a beautiful game with thrilling action, amazing visuals, and the need to constantly have the terraria wiki open while playing. you'll never feel bored while playing since the game constantly occupies you with something to do. boss battles and exploring new terrains never feel underwhelming. there's always something you can do in each new area you find, be it new bosses and enemies, or finding materials to help you upgrade your weapon and tools. I have over 50+ hours of game play (played on mobile then switched to PC), and even after the end game boss, you still find something to do (and i still have a lot of achievements to get). the music has such a nice nostalgic feel to it, plus the 2D style is very pleasant to the eyes. terraria brings together action, fishing, crafting, and sexy fox women to create an overwhelmingly dynamic game play. This is simply a wonderful game to have. for both hardcore gamers or for those who just want to pass time. 
now add a dating system so i can bang the fox woman please."

20945,the blue whales heart weighs about the same a as a small car like a beetle. the veins into the heart are so big that a small child i able to crawl though them easily. also a blue whale tongue whales about the same as an adult elephant. there oesophagus is so small that if a blue whale was to eat a loaf of bread they would chock and die. blue whales eat tons of food everyday. last fun fact about a blue whale: if a whale is to old and is not able to reach the surface for a breath of air they will sink to the bottom of the ocean piratically killing them selves. also the game is great.

20956,"Terraria expands on the enjoyable sandbox game with a greater style on combat and adventure that proves very satisfying.
Mining is really easy and overall the game is easy to play I like the design style of it, it makes the game even more special and masterpiece. Terraria Mods went really great and really helped the community find something new, I gotta say Terraria Mods  get me back on this game again. Thank you for this masterpiece game - 8.5/10"

20973,"Even though my hours are relatively low compared to the veterans or anyone who has played and enjoyed this game, I can honestly say it is one of the best games I have ever Played. Currently, a group of friends and I are playing through a world and it is so much fun, especially since it is so easy and so fun to play with them. There is so much to do including bosses, building, even grinding for items is fun. I would highly recommend this game to anyone. The price is worth it in my opinion."

20979,"Dear Re-Logic. Balance the master mode please. For now master mode is unbalanced garbage, where your exclusive reward is a piece of shiny shit and pet."
20980,"Tried playing it in 2014, never got anywhere. Built a house and didn't know what to do next.
Tried again in 2018, same situation.

But I gave it another run in 2022, playing with my girlfriend (she'd previously sunk 200 hours in) who was a tremendous help, and provided a much better experience with her know-how due to her previous hours. I never knew the game was so complex with the bosses, intricacies of each biome, and baffling amount of weapons/armor. Once I opened and read the wiki, I wanted to keep going.

If you've never played, the music is tremendous. So much so, that I was hearing it in my dreams! The mechanics of the game regarding combat feels fluid when you aren't getting debuffed by enemies or bosses. The visuals of the game are surprisingly stunning, from boss fights to weapon effects to enemy death animations, despite the 2D sidescroller gameplay.

If you're unsure about reentering the game again after a hiatus that didn't end well, try it again and keep the wiki open. Very detailed, highly valuable information and worth having open at all times while you're playing, on either the 2nd monitor or your Steam Browser overlay.

I beat the game too quick in my opinion. I laid out 98 hours in 2 weeks because it was just so enthralling. Managed to unlock all achievements as well. After it's all said and done, there isn't much replay value in Terraria. Unless you decide to beat the game again with a different build/class, or wanna farm up and make stunning structures. 

While my first few playthroughs were torture because I didn't know what was happening, on the come around for the 3rd time and reading up on what the game has to offer, I was instantly hooked. 

The game is dope, try it out"
20981,its decent i guess

Maybe my account getting hacked was a good thing because on this account i played 30+ hours. It was like a blessing. The game is cheap and entertaining. Had to look at the wikipedia 400 times or more but meh its worth it. SO BUY THE GODDAMN GAME AND PLAY THIS.

21070,pretty much.
21071,This game is fully of fun Easter eggs. My favorite is when you play hardcore mode and after you beat the eyes and destroyer/brain you can go down in the dungeon that spawns at either side of the map (make sure to not speak to the old man or this wont work) and there is a hidden npc there that will sell you an overpowered sword. Also make sure you have at least 50 gold on you because depending on the time of day it can get pretty expensive.
21072,good
21073,"By far the greatest strategy sandbox game I've come across. Terraria is full of replayability and always bring more to discover even if you've read the wiki from metaphorical cover to cover.

21091,"great game have been playing it for years on my PS4, but the workshop is overrun with NSFW"
21092,good game :)
21093,fun
21094,Fantastic game.
21095,i dawnloded it then spent 3 hoers in a haze my brain dosent work so bad spellibg wound recomend
21096,Fun with friends
21097,A Great game with lots of story
21098,"I believe this was one of the first games I got on steam, and I've basically grown up with it. Started playing near when it came out when I was like 6 or 7 -- I'm 18 now and still absolutely adore the game. It's definitely grown a lot since the beginning, and I love all that they've added, and that they kept putting more work into it even after so many years. 

On first look, the graphics may look dinky, but I think it gives it a nice unique charm, and even if you still can't get past that, everything else would make up for it. I love the soundtrack (and even listen to it when not playing the game sometimes), it has so many novelties inside it and so much character, and it's hard to describe the amount of content the game contains in only a few words. But I can guarantee you can get hours upon hours of gameplay with either defeating bosses, doing quests or tasks, collecting, building, and more. On top of that, you can even play with friends. 

I'll also say that more than likely you'll end up referring to the game's wiki quite often. It's almost necessary with how many items and craftables are in the game -- I can't remember them even after playing for so long.

All in all 11/10 game. I think $10 is a steal. It has been, and probably will always be, high on my list of favorite games."
21099,"Great
"
21100,:D
21101,One of my favorite game of all time. Great gameplay and  customization. Not to mention the best job listening to the community i have ever seen. Definitely deserves its place among the topselling games of all time

21133,Possibly one of the greatest games ever created

21158,"Terraria truly changed my life. I can't beleive that a game like this even deserves to be on such a website as steam, where only the best games are. Terraria doesn't even deserve steam. It deserves a national monument at the Whitehouse. Not the one the president lives at, the one that is a rusty shack in the middle of the the desert in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Because it is such a hidden gem. By hidden gem, I mean it's just a random peice of useless rock... That has a big fat diamond in the middle of it! Terraria really made me want to scream because of. Still not better than Crush Crush, IMO."

21196,"Acho que a essa altura do campeonato, o Terraria √© um jogo que dispensa feedbacks positivos, porque muita gente j√° comentou sobre, e quem jogou muito como eu, s√≥ tem aplausos pra dar. Mas eu sou um cara chat√£o que gosta de escrever, ent√£o bora l√°.

Se voc√™ j√° jogou Minecraft, podemos dizer que o Terraria √© parecido de certa forma, e a grande diferen√ßa eu nem digo que seja no gr√°fico. Imagine o Minecraft com todos aqueles mods incr√≠veis que voc√™ instalou pra melhorar o jogo. Esse √© o Terraria. Ele tem muita, mas muita coisa mesmo. E quando voc√™ acha que j√° viu de tudo, boom. O modo de jogo do seu mundo atualiza (conforme voc√™ vai realizando os eventos necess√°rios) e uma caralhada de coisa nova come√ßa a aparecer, e voc√™ volta pra aquela sensa√ß√£o de estar come√ßando num jogo novo.

√â um jogo absurdamente desafiador, e isso √© √≥timo quando paramos pra ver aquelas pessoas que julgam jogos pelo gr√°fico. O Terraria tem mais aventura, eventos, dificuldades, quests do muito RPG ou jogo de sobreviv√™ncia por a√≠, e ainda com o b√¥nus do sandbox, que te deixa no controle de poder fazer qualquer coisa que vier a sua imagina√ß√£o.

Imaginando classes de um RPG/jogos de sobreviv√™ncia, e analisando aquilo que melhor voc√™ se encaixa, tudo isso pode atender as suas expectativas no Terraria. Voc√™ curte guerriar, matar monstros, bosses, seja como guerreiro ou mago? Ent√£o esse jogo √© pra ti. Curte explorar, encontrar min√©rios novos, cavernas, biomas, tesouros? Ent√£o esse jogo √© pra ti. Curte construir casas, monumentos, decorar lugares e apanhar recursos? Cara, esse jogo tamb√©m √© pra ti.

O Terraria simplesmente se adapta a grande parte das pessoas, e se voc√™ tiver uma companhia para jogar, ent√£o convide ela, porque o singleplayer j√° √© muito imersivo, mas o multiplayer pode deixar tudo melhor.

Ent√£o sim, esse jogo √© muito bom, e se voc√™ quiser esperar uma promo√ß√£o para comprar o jogo por 10 reais, n√£o tem problema. Ele est√° sempre com desconto na maioria das promos da Steam, mas os 20 reais que ele pede (na data desse feedback, pelo menos) valem o jogo, sem d√∫vida alguma. Agora vai l√°, compra, e partiu gameplays."

21247,the best game I have ever played 100% recommend
21248," Hello there!
 Terraria is part of my entire life, from school days untill this day, and in every update I found something amazing to discover.
 You can replay it an infinite amount of times, alone as with friends, and if that's not enough, there are so many amazing mods to try.
 Even if the Journey ends, joy will never do so.
 Terraria needs you!"
21249,yes
21250,"So, Terraria. It's pretty cool. If you like games like Minecraft but want a game that takes longer than 30 minutes to reach late game in, then I'd recommend this. The game controls well, runs smoothly, and is fun to play. If you have like 3 friends and want a (relatively) cheap game to play together, I'd say this would be a good pick, due to the class system and the fact that it gets fun and hectic with more friends. My one complaint is that there is nothing to do after the final boss, but aside from that, it's a good game. Here is a list on why it is:

-Controls well
-Unique and fun bosses
-Multiple world difficulties and character difficulties for YOUR optimal experience
-Amazing pixel art visuals
-Neat weapons
-Simple but fun combat
-Build customizability with different accessories, buffs, set bonuses, and armor pieces
-Great soundtrack
-Finishing a house or base feels incredibly cathartic

But the game isn't without flaws. These flaws are:

-Lack of post game
-Melee and Mage class are the obvious favorites of the devs
-Hard to find motivation to continue playing singleplayer as a new player for more than 30 minutes at a time
-No cross platform
-Building is limited to 2D tiles and walls but there are ways to allow for tiles be passed through by the player

Overall, Terraria is a 9/10 and is one of the greatest games I have ever played I think you should play it.

21256,"With Terraria, it's only a matter of time before you get to play it. Everyone has played it and everyone has their own style while playing it. You could be on you 100th world and there easily may still be items and features you have never seen. This game has insane replay-ability and you generally never feel like the game gets too stale. It is extremely beginner friendly, while still being playable to users that have been here since its release.

I recommend this game to anyone with a computer and a keyboard."

21271,"Do I even need to write a review? It's TERRARIA. One of my favorite games of all time.

Ignore all that ""Terraria is just 2D Minecraft"" crap... The reality is: Minecraft is just 3D Terraria, And Terraria provides more fun gameplay."

21286,"[strike]2D Minecraft with Metroidvania style combat and graphics reminiscent of 16-bit era JRPGs.[/strike]

Terraria is a 2D action-adventure sandbox game that revolves around exploration, gathering materials & loot, crafting, building, survival, and combat.

First released in May 2011, Terraria deservedly won the 2021 Steam Award for ""Labor of Love"". On February 14th 2022, Re-Logic announced the 1.4.4 ""Labor of Love"" update.

With tons of content added over the years, and mod support, Terraria has a lot to offer. Though it can be overwhelming for new players.

PS: Here's a link to the official wiki, for those interested: https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Terraria_Wiki"
21287,is really brings the meaning of trial and error to reality and somehow manages to captavate us with its many creatures and bosses
21288,This game reminds me of minecraft if it was 2d but way better. There are so many items and 4 diverse classes to choose from. I 100% recommend

21326,Really Good Game! To say the least!
21327,"To the glaring eye, Its just a 2D Minecraft clone, but what they don't see is that this game is more replayable than any 2D sandbox you've ever played. More weapons than Minecraft has craftable items, a furniture game comparable to Animal Crossing, plus gets regular updates (As of posting this, they said the last update was 2 updates ago, with one more coming). Not to mention collaborative easter eggs with Dont Starve, Minecraft, and Dungeon Defenders + other smaller games. This game has my commendation."
21328,wa hao bing qi ling!
21329,"Buy it
 VERY GOOD"
21330,Kill funny slimes :)

21338,One of the best games i have ever played 10/10. If you even thought about buying this game just do it. the amount of content and entertainment is 100% worth the price. and after you beat the game you can get the free modding software and keep playing for hundreds of hours. Please get this game.

21362,:D
21363,"Love this game, perfect blend of dungeon-crawler-type mechanics and themes, with a lot of the adventure and intrigue provided by Minecraft. So much is packed into this 2d masterpiece, and if you are willing to take on the grind, it is well worth the effort the laughs, fun, pain and suffering and excitement you will find along the road to the Moonlord. Much recommended as a game for those like me who love grinding alone, those who love messing around with friends (it supports multiplayer) and also recommended for those who are simply too bored to play their favourite game (Apex is really dry this season, Terraria really hits the spot these days)."
21364,havnt played that much but its pretty gud

What's going on in the city?
People are saying they want to kill the boy.
Oh, no, they don't.
Look what you've done.
You can call it whatever you want.
I call it child abuse.
You know that kid's not a kid, and you know I'm not gonna play with him.
I'll say what I mean.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, look what you've done.

Oh, look what you've done.

21404,"Great game I suggest to play it with your friends. Lot's of achievements and stuff to do, game doesn't end after you kill the final boss you always have something to do like achievement hunting or trying to do a beautiful village. I pesonally love the game and come back to it even if my friend is not playing it anymore :(."
21405,bad game
21406,"This game is very fun to play with my friends, it's like Minecraft but with mods and it's 2D and pixel maybe, the point is this is my favorite game for 3 years from now, i very much recommending this to new user to download this game"

21431,"Terraria is a lot of fun, but a normal playthrough can take a while. If you're a builder, you will probably love this game. You can build nice houses, castles or futuristic stuff. I also recommend not to say ""Terraria is just 2D Minecraft"" cause that's wrong and it could be the last thing you said. But hey, you can build a lot of beautiful things in both games. But Terraria makes fun and is sometimes challenging. So feel free to play and build whatever you want! And you can fish for an NPC or for yourself if you want to. And the Devs don't ignore there community (Cultists)"

21469,"This is one of the best games I have ever played, and pretty much the only game I can confidently say is better is Minecraft.

The graphics are simplistic yet satisfying, they provide the player with a fun experience that has an almost retro feel. The game mixes a feeling of survival with a fun joyful 2D side scroller type. There are so many directions for players to go, from speedrunning to building to enjoying the little details. I have played for over 400 hours and have never once been truly ""bored"" by this game. Due to the updates by the developers the game seems to keep advancing as it's community grows. I have laughed and cried over this game, and when I play it now I feel an intense feeling of nostalgia. It embodies a part of my childhood that I never want to leave behind because of how blissful it seems looking back.

I have no complaints with the combat. The different types of weapons for any level of skill allows the players have a seemingly infinite array of directions to take their combat. You can build arenas or fight in the wild, you can use a flaming mace or an orange deathray. There is no flaw in the combat, and I find myself filling my inventory with weapons I know I'll never use, just because I enjoy how unique they are. Quite simply, anyone can find a way to enjoy the combat because there is something for everyone.

The building is amazing, almost to the level of Minecraft's. The amount of materials allows players to make builds with a huge amount of variety while still using the materials they have on hand, and although I have never been very skilled at building in this game I can tell by the community posts that there is a way for everyone to enjoy it. The fact that building is an essential part of that game (due to NPC housing) encourages players to make building a larger part of their gameplay and practice their techniques. Even I have managed to make a decent house, and for those not in the mood for the challenge of survival there is Journey mode, which perfectly balances on the line of survival and a mode with unlimited resources.

The progression in this game is amazing, the initial struggle to go into the caverns feels like such an accomplishment, and that feeling of accomplishment stays until the Wall of Flesh and beyond. The satisfaction is very much worth the struggle, and the game doesn't feel ""too easy"". Even if it did, there would be the different difficulties for the players to choose from, so that any age, skill level, or type of person could play this game. And with greater risk comes greater reward, which allows players willing to struggle an opportunity to get better prizes in exchange for their suffering.

The community is amazing, there are all different types of people congregating in one place just to enjoy a single thing, but they manage to do it together. From fanart to building, so many people find ways to appreciate this incredible game. People share, they interact, and they manage to all have this one thing in common. This game holds a special game in many people's lives, including mine. I created my Steam account to get this game, and that's just another way Terraria has genuinely changed me as a person. There is NOTHING wrong with this game, and if you get it on sale, good for you, but this game is, in my opinion, worth every single penny spent on it."
21470,fun game play this like 24 7 XD
21471,do do do do do do do do do do do do do do vhvhvhvhvh

21473,Im bad at it but my friend carries me
21474,"Great game - love the open world but with the structure of bosses.  Only downside is that you need to look up stuff on the wiki to know what to do or recipes.  But still a ton of fun and love the different classes (melee, ranged, magic, and summoner)."

21535,probably spent more time on the wiki. 10/10 would recommend
21536,best game! :>
21537,"Among the best of the best. Of any game. Ever.
The best description for this game is a creative boss rush, you kill enemies, make houses for NPCs, upgrade your equipment, kill a boss, repeat.

You can theoretically finish the game relatively quickly, but that's where the games prowess is. Terraria has a massive amount of replay-ability. Multiple classes to use (Range, Melee, Magic, Summon), [i] many [/i] weapons and sets of armor to help you on the journey. 

There is no way you can do everything in anything less than a couple hundred hours. I still haven't, and I have played over 200 hours on steam, and at least 100 more on console and mobile before that. Even if you manage to do everything, TModloader is officially supported as an app on Steam, and modding is simply something else. Easily enough for over 1000 more hours of play.

Do I recommend this game? Yes. Simple as that. It has multiplayer as well so the added chaos will make things even more fun.
"
21538,I like terrablade
21539,nostalgia and a great game

21607,good game
21608,plplplplplpl
21609,"My favorite game, so I'm a little biased. Terraria has solid progression, doesn't force the player through a sluggish tutorial, has an optional guide npc, and a great conclusion. This game thoroughly treats the player to a worthwhile venture. I started playing back in the time of souls of blight, and can say this game has improved vastly since then. This game is only 9.99 (USD) and provides a great many hours of entertainment. 
"
21610,This game has the most satisfying progression out of any game I've ever played.
21611,really great game so far ive had it like 4 days and im loving it! Would recommend.

"
21613,great game
21614,"Funny game, zenith go brrr. Copper pickaxe op. If you are reading this go fight eye of cuthulu. Star wand from fortnite in terraria when. Ice slime from terraria. Wall of flesh makes a great pet. Don‚Äôt disturb the guide. Queen bee is a lover."

21633,"i like it
"
21634,Good Game
21635,It is a great game to play and it is also very challenging. That is what makes it even better
21636,"I'll start by saying:  Terraria is simply one of the best games ever made.  It's the best co-op game ever made, in my opinion.  I've beaten this game solo and with a friend over a dozen times.  With all the mods available, you can get even more replays out of it.  There is so much sheer content in this game that takes hundreds of hours to enjoy.  There's just so much to do, explore, and fight.  It is no over-statement to call this game a masterpiece.  Play it."

21674,"What can i say.... this game thrives on creativity, there is always a new thing to do, new places to go, new classes and styles to play. it feels familiar in design ( retro style ) but it is anything but a retro game. Its a sandbox and we can do as we please in it. Been loving this game for 11 years. Its one of those games that i keep coming back to."
21675,Very good
21676,its just 2d fnaf

the weapons are amazing, the armor looks cool with useful set bonuses, the monsters are well designed and plentiful, including the bosses. the music is good too. and its made even better by mods. if you're one of the few who still hasn't tried this game i highly recommend you do."

21793,Fun game when u get to know how to play the wiki played a key part in my learning.
21794,very good and downloading worlds allows for so much
21795,"such a good game, so much to explore, sometimes you gotta grind a bit, but the gameplay, boss fights, and enemies makes up for all of it (and i'm not even done with 10% of the things)"

21803,SLIMES AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
21804,"Ok, so after 78 more hours, I think this game deserves a better review. I got into this game in quarentine¬†on the Xbox, and I've loved it ever since. The game never really holds your hand at all. It just spawns you into this scary and wonderful world and then leaves you to do whatever you want. It doesn't tell you anything, which I think adds to the fun factor of this game, and I think the music is one of the best ever. It adds a nostalgic feeling to the caves and the evils .You can mess around with friends or alone, and best of all, the weapons and bosses are just S-rank stuff. RECOMMEND

21805,"This was my first steam game, and maybe even my very first own game ever back in 2012. I even got a little pickaxe keychain which I'm still have on my home keys.
Overall the game changed a lot becoming better and better, and the devs gave us a lot of content and modding capabilities.
In summary an astonishing game despite of the simplistic looks."

21808,"i have 69 hours and i must say balls
"
21809,Pretty fun overall and depending in the difficulty pretty challenging. Also a pretty good game to play with friends.
21810,fucking amazing game
21811,"I just recently broke 1000 hours on this game, so I feel obligated to review it (and I want to, too!).

You‚Äôd think that if I‚Äôve played something for a thousand hours, I must like it. And you‚Äôd be right. Terraria is‚Ä¶ the best game I have ever played. But first, I must give you a little history of myself.

So, Terraria is the first real desktop game I played. By real, I mean not on a web browser (I played lots of arras.io). Before Terraria, I played Minecraft on my iPad. But only creative mode. I really liked building in Minecraft. Anyways, I was at a friend‚Äôs house, and my friend understood that I didn‚Äôt play any video games, so they let me try this game on their computer. I had no idea how to play, but I still liked it. Then, when I got my laptop, they bought me this game. We started playing it together, the three of us (one other friend as well). We finished the game in Normal mode while basically knowing little about how the game worked. Hell, we didn‚Äôt even know about double jumps, dashes, or the Goblin Tinkerer. We didn‚Äôt know why Moon Lord (the last boss) seemed to not be taking any damage. (After, we realized that he summons things that heal him unless you killed them. Even if we had realized at the time, we weren‚Äôt doing enough damage to kill the clots in time, anyways. I died 30 times and healed with the nurse more than 40 times in the winning fight. The fight took 45 minutes with the three of us. In classic mode, boss health doesn‚Äôt even scale, so we should have killed it in 2 minutes, because the average kill time for one person is 6 minutes.) Sorry if you have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about.

After that first multiplayer playthrough, I spent all my time reading the wiki and watching all sorts of youtube videos. Not even playing, just reading and watching. I memorized all the important things about the game, and learned insane strategies. And then I found multiplayer servers.

I had no idea what servers were at the time. I followed a youtube video to join one. I was immediately overwhelmed. So confusing stuff. So, there‚Äôs this server software thing called TShock which is essentially a mod for servers. You can teleport people, give them items, butcher enemies, etc. All by typing in a command! (For those of you that play minecraft, think of the command console. Same idea.) I have the capacity to learn quickly, so I did. The server had all sorts of stuff. I became proficient at the minigames. As of this review, over 700 of my 1000 hours on the game are on that one server. I have tried other servers, but that one is the best, in my opinion. (IP: penguingames.fun  Port: 7777)

The bad side of playing on servers is that you don‚Äôt improve much at the regular game. The minigames (such as Parkour) use weird techniques and stuff that you will never use in a normal playthrough. So, even after all these hours, I am very. Very. Bad. At the base game. But I know the theory and stats.

Okay, here‚Äôs the actual review. Gameplay 10/10. Decoration 8/10. Sprites 8/10. Animation 7/10. UI 8.5/10. Very balanced game overall. In classic/normal mode, if you pay enough attention, you will rarely die. In master mode (hardest mode), everything kills you in 2 or 3 hits, maybe 5 with endgame overpowered armor and stuff. Lots of unique items. Over 15 bosses to fight. Some bosses are bullet hell-type. 10 or so biomes to explore, plus unique structures. Enemies are interesting. Most major bugs have been fixed. 

Lastly, let‚Äôs look at mods. These are player/fan-made additions to the game. Mods can be played using tModLoader, a game that you can get for free on steam if you own terraria. I‚Äôm not going to cover how to install them. Mods vary from overhauling the game, adding better sprites (wait, actually that‚Äôs a texture pack), quality of life, new bosses, new AI for enemies in the base game, to adding extra-large worlds and doubling the number of items. All that! Just for 10 dollars (5 while on sale).

I haven‚Äôt completed any singleplayer playthrough of this game (had other stuff to do), but I am working on defeating all bosses without taking damage. I have also played a few other games since I got this one, namely: DRG (deep rock galactic), Core Keeper, Geometry Dash, and Splitgate. Terraria is still the most fun‚Ä¶

TL,DR: great gameplay, feels smooth and semi-balanced (logic is weird though), lots of content, cheap for the price, endless possibilities. You can build amazing stuff. Overall rating 9.5/10. Get this game. Thanks for reading!

21844,"It's unspoken rule that this game must be in your steam library at all time. If you haven't played it, buy it.
It's far from being a 2D Minecraft clone with heaps of depth, and content.

Even if you don't like it it's only A$15 on Steam.

(I have way more hours played over the years than what's listed due to having played almost entirely before I had a proper internet connection, and also my time in the mobile version which is also not counted)"
21845,very fun :)
21846,"People who say this is 2D Minecraft are extremely wrong. This game has so much content to delve into, can run on basically any PC and is very worth it for its abysmally low price tag."

21851,
21852,yes
21853,"Very great game, you can see the devs have put alot of work into this, all the sprites look amazing and the bosses are great. Totally recommend this game."
21854,"Hands down, the best minecrafty experience. I played other games like it, but nothing compares.
Terraria is my #1 survival building crafting exploration game that I played since it came out.

You get the survival, exploration, build, upgrade, harvest and crafting + tons of items and content. Top-notch bosses, progression across multiple biomes, special events and what not. 

I always felt lackluster playing other games of similar nature, either the crafting and exploration was good, but the combat wasn't and the bosses felt cheap. Or the combat was great but it lacked all the harvesting managing part done well. 

The game is regularly updated, and for someone who got my entire family and friends hooked on the game, I'm still playing it a decade later. Multiplayer is very fun, even tho I completely recommend the single player first, to get familiar with the game.

UPDATES: You no longer need to read the wiki like your life depends on it. The team made the Guide actually be a wiki and even defend itself after years of torment! Items constantly being added, changed so there are so many ways to play the combat, melee ranged magic pets summons. 


Oh and the music will ring in your mind forever and bring you happy feelings. 

This game is nothing short of legendary. You're committing a crime by not playing it."
21855,Its fun
21856,funni game for 10 players
21857,"Terraria is a very good adventure / action game, I think it's got serious potential, I love the feel of the game, it's pretty well done, very sexy well drawn achievements,  this game is seriously good, I recommend this to many people, anyone reading this that's even remotely interested in the game, give it a go! very good, frequent updates, 10/10 game, it's almost 100% perfect but obviously every game has its flaws!"
21858,gud gam
21859,I still can't believe minecraft copied this game.

21868,HEHEHE NICE
21869,shit garbage this game can suck my dick and balls
21870,"The depth and complexity of the crafting system in this game *really* scratches a mental itch for me. I love the fact that the best weapon you can get in the first half of the game is made by combining four other weapons, three of which have their own crafting trees. Then that weapon contributes to the best weapon in the entire game, which you get by combining ten total weapons, most of which have their own crafting trees as well. This is the ideal game for someone who loves deep, incremental-progression-type gameplay."
21871,Why there is no builders craft in this minecraft?!
21872,It is like 2D minecraft with a heavy focus on killing cool bosses and making fun builds to fight bosses
21873,this game is incredible 10/10

21899,This is literally the best game ever. I can't express how much a recommend this.
21900,Fun survival game. great to play with friends.
21901,"Boy, I started playing Terraria in 2013 when it first came out on the Amazon Appstore. I played it to death on my Kindle Fire, and I instantly fell in love.

Fast forward a few years, I finally got it for PC. Honestly, I would describe this game, but I simply cannot. This game, for all intensive purposes, is a masterpiece not only in the general idea of video games, not only in the content it holds, but is a masterpiece because it allows you, the player, to create your own masterpiece. The play styles, the environments, the challenges especially presented by the fairly new Master Mode, it's all so, so, so incredible. I haven't even gotten around to modding the game, but from what I can tell, the modding community is extremely, extremely strong (applause to all the creators of the mods out there).

But seriously, if you want endless hours of fun, purchase this game. It has to be played to be understood as to why it is such an incredible game. This game is so approachable, yet complex, as I've said, you are the player, you make the choices.

Thank you for the good memories with friends, Re-Logic. And to those reading this review, whether you be veterans, newbies, or those looking to buy Terraria for the first time, just have fun, become immersed in the experience. I am proud to consider myself a 'Terrarian' for sure. 11/10, recommend to anyone and everyone."

21935,"terraria steam workshop was a mistake
10/10 would play again"
21936,g
21937,lots of fun
21938,The game is NOT like minecraft in any way.
21939,pretty neat game
21940,You harvest resources to add them in a crafting inventory and kill mythical creatures while traversing a 2 dimensional side scroll map. This game has custom characters and offers a multiplayer mode if you want to play with friends or the community.
21941,"Terraria is quite calming in some parts of the game but also really nerve racking and quite stressing too but that's what makes it thrilling and a game that i would recommend to everyone who's looking for and adventurous, calming/thrilling, fighting and like to build then i 100% recommend this game to you, best ¬£6.99 I've ever spent!"
21942,Empress of Light kinda hot
21943,evil evil game
21944,"Its a complete masterpiece:
-Excellent combat
-Fun and rewarding exploration
-You may play hours without noticing
-If you have friends to play with,its a blast
-More difficulties for those who want a REAL challenge
-Amazing and giant community with a ton of really good mods
-Bugs are RARE
-Tons of possiblities to free your imagination
-Developers listen to players
-Very satisfying progression system

But it has a few downsides:
-Its hard to understand how to start playing(but the game guides you at certain points)
-You WILL need to grind if you want to have success in this game(some people see this as an upside)
-Its hard to play without the wiki

Conclusion: 10/10
It has downsides,but this game may be the most perfect ever created,every single bit feels polished and fun.And when you get friends with you,its just a absolute blast.The price is 200% worth it"
21945,IT A GREAT GAME FOR PEOPLE TO PASS TIME BUT IT IS FUN
21946,"This is a very fun game based on exploring, mining, building, and combat. If you are young, there is a setting that makes the things you kill not burst into blood and body parts, it instead just poofs into smoke like in Minecraft. It is also very cheap for its quality. Please try."
21947,It is really fun. You should try it out.
21948,"I've been playing this game since early 2017 and it made my time without internet enjoyable. Once you get the hang of things it becomes easier. I love how the world changes for each boss you defeat. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Mikecraft, Stardew valley or minecraft."
21949,favorite game 10/10
21950,It's a dope game. Never gets old. Recommend.
21951,Great Game
21952,better than minecraft
21953,"if you are looking for a game full of things to do with a long history and that you will never tire of, it is perfect for you! I have a world for 50 hours (I had the game cracked before) and I always think ""what is this ???"" ""a new enemy ?!"" ""and this mineral?"" and I assure you that you will have to spend some time informing yourself before you understand the game well. Recommended with flying colors!"
21954,"yeah, it's pretty good. haven't played the game too much but it is still pretty fun"

21959,"kind of a complicated game. youll definitely need to open the wiki several times while playing if you dont know the game in and out. this game makes me wish the steam browser had a tab pinning feature. its a fun game though once you figure out what youre doing. and its like, what, 10 bucks or something? i dunno i bought it like 8 years ago i think this was actually the second game i ever bought on steam. either way this game costs 6x less than most AAA releases and i guarantee you its about 200x more fun."

22009,How the balls are u supposed to join your friends on mobile with this trash system they got going on. Crossplay is butter water on this game. Definitely would not recommend.
22010,Minecraft
22011,terria good if like self torchure
22012,Great game. Would recommend for players who like an adventure or building.
22013,"2D minecraft pixel style game.You can craft , equip and fight different monsters"
22014,"Great game. I think the versatility of the game would be great for someone who wants to enjoy both game and lore. The lore itself seems rich and complex, the game itself is light enough to have without worry."
22015,"It is super fun, the bosses are awesome, the gameplay is smooth, the biomes are really cool, and the enimies are what makes this game fun.But this game doesn't have very good inventory machanics and finding gold,platinum, and anything else very valuable is hard and you can easily get lost.But i think this game is very fun"

22028,"terraria cool , punjabi no virus , so halal mode"
22029,"this game gave me the ability to summon satan, highly recommended if you want to learn and play at the same time!"
22030,"tons of fun and lots of gametime, the only thing i don't like is that they are constantly updating the game and adding more content even tho it was supposed to get it's final content a long time ago with it's ""final update""."

Id like to add that this is a game that you play 20 hours of in a short amount of time and leave for a while before coming back and doing it again its very much a drop off and pick back up later game. Its sort of like minecraft with way more bosses, weapons, items and things to do.

22056,played this since the OG days and i love it so much still
22057,Love this game have been playing it ever since it came out on xbox 360 then xbox one then on steam
22058,"(Took from my tmodloader cuz im lazy)

After hitting 600 hours, I think now's the time to put in my input. I stated playing pretty young, back when it first came out. A friend had it on his Xbox and we played a bit, but never did anything other than fuck around. All i can remember us chopping trees, and being very annoyed by acorns. Later down the road me and my brother got it for the PS4 and shit got real. The game had turned into something amazing, as I have waited a few years before coming back to it. We played this only, and sometimes guitar hero. This was one of the best ways i spent my time as a 11-14yo. At 15 I actually got a job lmao, anyways-. We played for some months, and made amazing progress, I built a mega base as a surprise, and our faces when we beat expert moon lord were unmatched. We were jumping up and down, hugging eachother, cheering, our dad had to come make us calm down, lol. Anyways, after that we settles down on terraria, and then I head of Tmodloader, back when it was a standalone exe.

Oh. My. God. The mechanic of ""modding"" was new to me, and it took my maybe 2 weeks to get it to work. I was on a i3 laptop, but it ran, and I was amazed. The gameplay changes hit me like a truck; all these new possibilities for an already legendary game, was so unfathomable to me, and yet right there in my hands was where the power was. And I got right to gaming. For many years now tmodloader has brought me limitless joy, and I know it will bring it to you to. Buy the game, and when you and your friends are done with vanilla, hop on tmodloader to see what really makes terraria, one of the best games I've ever owned"

22095,I Love  Game
22096,"Honestly at first I thought I would've not enjoyed the game. Back when I was younger there were some events going on with a toxic friendship and sadly this game was a huge part of their personality so I always subconsciously attached it to a very low part of my life. Which this game does not deserve. This game has gotten me addicted to it and every moment is like experiencing a form of reverse depression. I was always thrilled at every high and every low. Scrolling through videos and wikis and obtaining the best and strongest loot. 


Terraria is near perfect.
Near..
I have 2 simple issues with the game.
-1, this game is absolutely horrible at getting new players in. I was really overwhelmed at the start and thought I should've quit again (I got this game on ps4 before but immediately dropped it right after, the controls on console aren't good.)
-2, Once the game reaches its best part, it just ends so fast and suddenly. Once you beat the final boss there isn't much to do. 

Other than these flaws, I highly recommend playing this game. It's worth it."
22097,
22098,"Finally. After 240 hours of game play I have completed all the achievements for this game. I love this game so much, there is so much to do and so much to accomplish. Even though I have done so much, there is still plenty of things to do. It makes me so happy that Terraria's last updates and journey's end signified all the great journeys everyone has when playing the game. Over the 10 days of total gaming on the computer, and countless more on mobile, I can safely say that Terraria is the one of the most fun, and well made game. I will love this game forever."
22099,"pretty fun on servers, chill solo cool game w/e"
22100,its good
22101,wtt

22160,"Holy fucking shit. I want to bang the terraria zoologist so goddamn bad. I can't stand it anymore. Every time a blood moon occurs I get a massive erection. I've seen literally every rule 34 post there is of her online. My dreams are nothing but constant fucking sex with Astria. I'm sick of waking up every morning with six nuts in my boxers and knowing that those are nuts that should've been busted inside of Astria's tight fox pussy. I want her to have my mutant human/fox babies.

This 5v5 tactical hero shooter by League of Legends developer Riot Games had a stranglehold on me from my first carefully strategized victory. Now, after clocking 90 hours between the closed beta and the full release, I'm still utterly enamored with the brilliant implementation of its superpowered cast and stellar gunplay. The learning curve is steep, but once the cogs of mastery clicked together, it became damn near impossible for me to put Valorant down."

starting a world for myself has been a very good decision in getting to experience this game properly.
having played mostly 3D first person games, including Minecraft (which this game gets compared to, A LOT), and not having a very good experience the first time i tried it, i did not expect myself to like this game, but i absolutely LOVED it!

22326,gaem good
22327,"very fun, lots to do, I love the combat and all the caves you can explore, definitely more fun if you have a friend to play along with, but still enjoyable on your own"
22328,I recommend this game to Ben.
22329,"VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD GAME strongly reccomend, there is so much things to explore , and i absolutely love it!!"
22330,its good i guess
22331,It is fantastic
22332,swag
22333,this game contains many different ways to explore and enjoy.you can have a try.
22334,i like it but i don't even have the game
22335,great game
22336,Awesome game
22337,"banger of the game
"
22338,"although Terraria is super enjoyable, the game receives WAY too much praise for what it is. Terraria just happens to be the oldest one out there. 
I personally find an issue with the the fact that Terraria often forces you to look for better weapons after certain marks of progression yet makes the variety of viable weapons small. I would really like to enjoy my older weapons without having to worry about the fact that they become completely irrelevant after I beat an important boss. 

there are a lot more small issues about this game that become more apparent as you play. they aren't game-breaking or unbearable at all, but they are certainly obvious.

despite all that, yes the game is great!

8/10 - way too many design flaws, way too fun of a game to care"
22339,good game
22340,"fun asf when playing solo since theres alot to explore, will definitely be much more fun with friends"
22341,"I LOVE this game! I've been playing Terraria since it first released, over a decade ago. I'm still playing it to this day. I first played it on Xbox 360, then Xbox One, then on Nintendo Switch, and now on Steam. It's THAT good. I know it's a controversial opinion, but I think this game is infinitely better than Minecraft, without a doubt. With all the expansions, add-ons, DLCs, and mods, it has made this great game even better!"
22342,NO LO JUEGUEN EL BISIO ES MUCHO
22343,still play this game
22344,great
22345,"idk how much time i spent on cracked terraria in the past, but that should be enough to tell you how good this game is. no more further words, just numbers, 11/10."
22346,"This game is beyond good, and there's not much I can say that 764,000 others haven't said already. Re-Logic is still working on the title, giving it little touches of love. The community in this game is still pogging hard, and the modding community is creating pogs.

Play this as is for a while, then get T Modloader. Might be one of the best investments you can make"
22347,"Nice game, cool bosses, easy progression, fun, cool weapons, cool everything. 8/10 game."
22348,I Destroy Golden Critters on Sight

22352,"This was the last game me and my wife played before she passed away from ligma, will always hold a special spot in my heart."
22353,"cooooooooollllll game
"
22354,"[b] It's a very good game, that's really long and expansive for only $10, and you get more than your money's worth [/b] The game is $10, which is a very good price for a game this expansive. I have played the game quite a bit, but I still have stuff to do. It may seem similar to Minecraft from an outside perspective, but it is really different from it. You start off gathering wood, building a house, as well as houses for npc's, mining, etc. But later on you fight bosses, getting the best gear, and you get to the final boss, then you realize that's not the last boss, and you get thrown into harcore mode. Hardcore mode adds a bunch of new items, weapons, enemies, as well as being more difficult. I could talk all day about Terraria, but I need to keep this readable."

22375,"While not a bad game, this game requires an INCREDIBLE amount of dedication and time to get anything done.  I have played many directionless games before and enjoyed them, but this is the most open (in a bad way.)  Also not allowing you to browse crafting recipes unless you have ALL of the materials on you is one of the worst game decisions in a crafting game I've ever experienced.  

I know it's overwhelmingly positive... I believe this game must be played and enjoyed by people with no responsibilities and a ton of time to kill (and waste.)  For me, there was just too much mining in the dirt for hours without finding anything worth a damn."
22376,gg.

22384,good
22385,game smacks highly reccomend
22386,"Terraria, what a wondrous and amazingly fun game. Such a great and fun game to play not just solo but with friends, good way to describe Terraria is basically Minecraft but 2d and with over 50+ hours of content. You wanna use a yoyo or a bow or even a giant sword to fight and destroy anything standing in your way? Try this game out. So much armor and weapons and so much content, especially with 1.4 aka Journeys End that came out that adds even more to the game such as golfing. You know the developers of this game absolutely love this game when even after releasing Journeys End they're still adding more content. Please give this game a try if you haven't already, it goes on sale all the time and especially at $10 base price it's definitely worth it. 10/10

PS: The devs also support modding aka TModLoader, free ""dlc"" that comes with Terraria."
22387,Lost my f***ing save. Let's start fresh. Again. 10/10 tho
22388,its a great game

22399,"This game means a lot for me and my family. My dad, brothers, and me played this together all the time. It was always really fun, and there was always that 1 person who got all the luck in drops. I do wish they would add more to the game, the Moon Lord boss doesn't feel like an ending to the game."
22400,it good
22401,"This is probably my favorite game to go back to after a long hiatus. My kids and I will play for about a month, getting past moon lord, but then we put it away for sometimes a few years. We've done this several times over the last six years, logging over 1,000 hours.  I just learned about the mods, so I'm hoping to add content that will keep us in the game longer this time. Still, one of my favorite games of all time."
22402,brother..... imagine thinking this is 2d minecraft sad kids
22403,wenamechainasama
22404,very fun game.. kinda grindy. takes a lot of time
22405,"I've played this game for hundreds of hours (that's counting my playtime on mobile and on here) and I can say with confidence that it's one of the best games I've ever played. The graphics are simple but charming, the game play is smooth, the developers are great, and even once you beat the game, there's still tons of stuff for you to do. If you are reading this because you aren't sure if you should buy it or not, I highly recommend giving it a shot."

22492,its fine
22493,"Honestly, this game blew me away. If you play Minecraft, you'll like this game. Don't get me wrong, this game has a completely different atmosphere than Minecraft, but your building skills will come in handy. This game brings out a lot of building skills that I honestly didn't even know I had. The main aspect being combat, every boss fight is incredibly fun (with a few frustrations: fuck you, Queen Bee). This game lives up to the hype, in my opinion.

The complexity that Terraria has to offer is what makes this game so worth it."

Its easy to get lost in the game."

22586,"Throughout the many hours of spending my time engrossed with this game, it is definitely a great game to play. What makes Terraria mostly fascinating is that the game is compiled with a lot of content and tasks to complete. In comparison to most survival games such as Minecraft, it includes way more progression and time to finish the game. If you ever feel like the game is too short for whatever reason, you could also make the game more entertaining and long-lasting by installing tModLoader on steam. It features a variety of mods to experiment with, which makes the game more engaging. I do recommend playing Terraria either alone or with a group of friends."
22587,"this game is so much fun, you can always find a way to do something you have not already done"

22632,"Dear reader,

I really feel that reviews are not needed for this game, it is a certified classic. This game has evolved so much over the years, getting better and better. It is now in (at least according to what the devs say now) it's final state. It has been and will continue to be fun.

The graphics are charming and beautiful. Gameplay is excellent. Play this game now.

This will run on anything. It also has great mod support with TModloader on steam as well for free. This greatly increases the amount of content availible. There is also multiplayer availible for it.

Graphics: 10/10
Gameplay: 10/10
Fun: 10/10

22679,"It's Terraria, what is there to say.... be prepared to die a LOT! Overall a really fun game. Bosses can be hard and annoying sometimes, but the rewards are definitely worth it. I would highly recommend this game to all my friends."
22680,"I run this game on like 5 fps with friends, it's a powerpoint slide and I love it"
22681,amazing game
22682,great game if you like a semi-difficult but also easy game
22683,"If you're a big fan of 2D action-adventure games then Terraria (in my opinion) is the best for that.  It's a lot of fun with friends and even just playing by yourself is fun.  There's an add-on called ""tModLoader"" (It's free on steam) and that alows you to get Terraria mods and it makes the game 10x more fun and the best thing about it is you and your friends can use the same mods and play together.  I recommend this game!"
22684,yes
22685,so good
22686,this is fun
22687,yummy
22688,"very hard and fun game! it has plenty of cool features in this game for example tools not breaking, huge selection of bosses and weapons, tools, and armor, very worth your money. also go to Tmodloader. there you can play many cool mods of terraria like calamity and thorium"
22689,"best game ever.

"
22725,"There is no other game quite like Terraria. I have put so many hours into this game over the years between 3 different platforms and I keep coming back for more. It is so enticingly addictive, never have I gotten tired of it. I always end a play session knowing exactly what I want to do next. I cannot recommend this game enough."
22726,Rather end it then play masters mode but love the game itself
22727,really fun and relaxing game when there's no boss
22728,"An absolutely incredible game that can easily give you hours upon hours of playtime (I'm talking months). You can easily customize your character with all sorts of equipment and the exploring, building, and preparations you make are just as fun as fighting off a boss or event."

22740,really good for playing with friends
22741,this is super awesome such a nice 2d game
22742,Really fun game to come back to as I love pixel graphic-survival games. I really started to learn more about it recently and have been doing my first actual play through of the game and it has been thrilling from the variety of biomes to the bosses. I also started to learn how to build and it is actually limitless in what you can create. Probably one of my favorite games to play to chill and relax with.
22743,"good game

22813,"This has been my favorite game for years now. There's just so much to do, so much replay value. Graphics look nice, the controls are satisfying and can be customized, it's beginner friendly with a high skill ceiling,  and the game has so much personality (check some of the tooltips). There's so much workshop content as well, and many mods to also explore with the modloader. The devs are consistently active and interact with the playerbase very well. It's a wonderful game made by wonderful people. So much more than the ""2D Minecraft"" i thought i was getting all those years back."

22942,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories
"
22943,"This game has brought me 83 hours of fun so far, and i dont regret a second of it.

If you like exploration, building, combat, progression, and boss fights. then this is the game for you"

I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth. If you still even remember that name.

But I'm afraid you've been misinformed.

You are not here to receive a gift. Nor, have you been called here by the individual you assume. Although, you have indeed been called.

You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune.

A labyrinth with no exit. A maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust of blood has driven you in endless circles. Chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near.
Yet somehow out of reach.

But, you will never find them. None of you will.

This is where your story ends.

And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although, there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be.

I am remaining as well. I am nearby.

This place will not be remembered and the memory of everything that started this, can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should.

And to you monsters trapped in the corridors. Be still. And give up your spirits.

They don't belong to you.

As for most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps, warm, waiting for you after the smoke clears.

Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole. So, don't keep the Devil waiting, friend.

My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up in their arms, the way you lifted others into yours.And then, what became of you, I should have known, you wouldn't be content to disappear. Not my daughter. I couldn't save you then.

So, let me save you now. It's time to rest, for you, and for those you have carried in your arms...
This ends.

For all of us.

End communication."

22973,"Newish account so i only have 50 hours, but holy smokes is this one of the best games out there; I have easily dumped several hundred hours into this game and there's still so many things to do. Additionally, the music in this game is incredible, comparable to even Undertale. If the base game somehow bores you hop on Tmod Loader, where the community can also create limitless amounts of fresh and unique content.
If you are viewing this because you are considering buying, do so immediately, there are very few games as popular as Terraria that can even compete with the dev interactivity and community support.

I love finding loot in chests and building houses to my town npc that move in if you have specific things for example, The Party Girl is a town npc that will move in your house if you have very many npcs in your houses and to build those houses you need atleast 1 chair and 1 table or a crafting bench and one light source and 1 door and last but not least walls to the room and a roof, now thats a npc house. Which bosses are extremely hard and other extremely easy and you need to kill them to progress in the game. Overall, i love this game! and i would recommend to buy it and try it!"
22992,good game
22993,pretty good game if you wanna rage like you've never raged before.
22994,"After all these years, I think I've finally realised- how much I may love this game. It's similar feeling to playing Minecraft, when I spent countless hours on building something, except Terraria is different- it isn't just about building, but the whole bosses, mobs, caves, events system.. it makes the game both amazing for spending my time building my pretty houses, and grinding for resources, discovering caves, undergrounds. Must play- I must say now :)"

23066,"great game, classic enjoyable and brings back the 2016 me back to life."
23067,"I really like Terraria because of the part linear, part dynamic progression. What I mean is, you can do basically anything, but if you want more to do, you have to beat bosses to progress. I especially like the concept of certain ores and biomes only spawning after you enter Hardmode, meaning you can;t just get all the way stacked before beating the Wall of Flesh."

p.s i highly recommend the 4 pack that costs 30 bucks, having friends to play with makes it even more fun. play on expert too to compensate for the extra people! (you might be in for a real hard time at points tho lol)

"
23207,good for playing in class
23208,"very epic game, trust"
23209,"I played Terraria back on my Xbox 360 and I've loved it ever since. I definitely recommend it for anyone with a creative mind and for people looking for a challenge.
It takes a little bit to learn the mechanics and progression, but the longer you play the more you master everything! (still don't know how i know half the stuff i learned, guess it just came naturally lol)"

23411,"Fun game with tons of content and one of the best dev teams on Steam. It needs no introduction, it's just Terraria. What started as ""2d minecraft"" has become its own fully fleshed out, unique, and near infinitely replayable adventure. Obvious recommendation."
23412,The 2d movement maybe be a turn off for some players but the game makes up for it by having such amazing content but you will need a second monitor for the wiki tho
23413,If a person asks me what i think a perfect game is i show them Terraria.
23414,"So I did not like this game i thought it wasent for me.
But the funny thing is that when i tries returning it [ 97 minutes played]  it got rid of the game from my steam library and no money was added back to my profile.
While this has nothing to do with the game its self i feel as if I got scammed for this product ."

23445,Pretty good game and a litle bit cheap
23446,"mati like, mati play, mati enjoys"
23447,"Terraria is a game I have sunk a lot of hours in to. It has a way to suck you in and keep you playing for hours on end. A really great game with a lot of replay-ability. But, I would not recommend this game if you are a fan of sexual intercourse. The fact that I can't have sex with any of the non-player characters is almost Orwellian in nature. It's almost as if we were living in 1984 itself. I myself am a professional sexist, so I know a thing or two about sexual intercourse. The fact that I can't perform coitus in my 2D Sandbox game is abysmal. You might say that I could just download mods to my game, but I am not a hacker and hacking is a sin. Socrates once said ""The only good is knowledge and the only evil is ignorance"", and I feel like the devs of this game are being rather ignorant for not adding mature content to their game. Anyway, I like this game very much other than that major problem that I hope is fixed in a new update."

23505,"This game is one of the best games ive bought and has many great things such as music, pixel art and gameplay but an issue for me personally is the fact there is an "" overwhelming"" amount of content from the start and is pretty much impossible to complete the game without getting information from the internet but that is also a good thing because you will have a game that you can play for a long time and not get bored. in summary for me the game is 9/10"

23559,good gam
23560,I love pixelated ass.
23561,"Now if your here you might want to see what others DON'T like about Terraria. I have a love hate relationship with this game the first thing i will say is the beginning can be slow boring and not fun and for me personally i think a good intro to a game keeps players HOOKED but i can imagine that many players may just ...stop. But the game DOES get BETTER this game does have one the WORST tutorials ever you aren't told what to do at ALL the wiki and guides are the ONLY way you can even ENJOY this game (don't play blind). Now that's fine if a tutorial is for a game in a different genres but this just feels CRUEL also when crafting you can only see what you can craft but i STILL would like to see items i CAN'T. for an example i was making arrows and looking up stuff on the wiki ( you do that a lot ) and come across a item that allows for a dash move ( the master ninja gear ) and i realize i had the parts needed to make it but i had not thought i'd need them anymore so i threw them away and movement in Terraria is very IMPORTANT ( to me at least ). so if i had a way to see items not able to be crafted i would greatly appreciate ( ...hell even minecraft has it). the combat does feel a bit boring i'm not entirely sure how that could be fixed though the bosses in Terraria really CARRY this game the bosses aren't to difficult ( i first try all of them except for duke FishRon and wall of flesh...)but they are very fun, i very much enjoyed the empress of light boss for the fun bullet hell style fight. i also do want to say that this TYPE of game isn't for me i'd rather play different types of game BUT the other survival sandbox games do a MUCH better job at what Terraria try's to do ( don't starve does better combat and art style ) the NPC characters are nice and fun but i do like the mechanic where the NPCs want to live in different Biomes and like different NPCs but i just felt like it was there to WASTE my time honestly because you basically HAVE to have them in different places to get them pylons. pylons are the way to teleport across the map which is VERY useful ( also some randomly spawn anywhere on the map which is stupid instead of just moving in). Now this next part is very subjective but i like the CONCEPT of the crimson and corruption but in execution they are one of the worst game mechanics every i hate ( second only to the grinding needed in octopath traveler ) the infected Biome spreads across the land cool idea. But how do you get rid of it well.... you can use the purified powder which HARDLY works or the Clentaminator which is obtainable in the late game which when the wall of flesh is defeated the world enters hard mode which makes the infected Biome spread FASTER. there is the third option probably the BEST but most annoying... digging a tunnel... all the way around the biome so it can escape to nearby land which is very time consuming and BORING. the game does have a good sense of progression one of the best but to get there is hard and with the beginning being well... bad i'm not sure if many players will get that far i mean 50 percent of players haven't even beat the FIRST BOSS. I do like the addition of the classes in the game it REALLY needed that to be good. i do feel like playing this game blind ( I've never watched an play through of it i don't see ANYONE beating the game or even get to the wall of flesh due to you needing to drop a item into the lava in the underworld which is like the least cryptic way to spawn a boss the moss being duke fishron for needed to use the bug net which is like USELESS normally and then fish with the truffle worm only found rarely in the mushroom Biome. this is one of the hardest games to beat purely blind. this game is selling for 10.00 USD a good price you might as well pick up and some of you might even become part of the big terraria fandom but for MANY i just don't see this game clicking if you want a more survival based game play don't starve if you want a more chilled experience play stardew valley i didn't think it was for me but its was a very good game. also i feel like the game once is beaten just kinda feels... empty like there not much else to do. SO my final verdict is Terraria is a decent game... but i'm not sure it's for everyone with its flaws that just need to be fixed. So thank you for your time and reading. My rating is 6.5 to 6.7"

23618,"Corruption destroys anything and everything you love... It's nearly impossible to predict if you are a builder. End game will destroy your creations in a heartbeat and it does not stop spreading regardless of how fast or slow you are at killing the ""main"" objectives. In the long run, a game file will get repetitive and boring as all biomes (and diversity) become corrupted. I only played so long because I desperately tried to save my villages. Just leads to heartbreak anyways."
23619,can't sex empress of light
23620,"I was deep underground, far from home, looting one of the many abandoned homesteads left to be discovered in Terraria's ever-generous bounty of nooks, crannies, alcoves, and recesses. To my left I found a twisted bit of minecart rail, populated exclusively by a nest of extremely territorial face-eating bugs that seemed eager to prove that my loose assemblage of iron-hewed armaments weren't cutting the mustard anymore. Whatever. This cabin seemed safe. Sure it was covered in musty spiderwebs, and broken furniture, but there was a golden chest on the top floor and a loom I was excited to take back to my modest township on the bottom. What could possibly go wrong?

As it turns out, nothing was going to go wrong. There wasn't a scripted boss encounter or an interrupting dirge of story exposition lying in wait for any adventurer who breached the walls. That'd be extremely un-Terraria. However, I managed to find something even scarier. if you're an idiot like me, you might not notice the underground reservoir of water above the roof until you inadvertently jam your pickaxe through the last brick keeping it at bay.

The building flooded in seconds, dowsing all of my torches, leaving me in total darkness. I took a few moments to admire the truly unique mess I'd made of everything before pulling out a glowstick (which stay lit underwater), swimming to the foyer, and flinging open the door, which sent the water rushing outwards and away from me. It was a completely improvised solution, in the face of a completely dynamic problem‚Äîeclectic dungeoneering, powered solely by the infinite potential of a player's arsenal. That is the essence of Terraria.

23670,its okay i guess
23671,"Terraria was an amazing game, as you can do so much things in it, like build a giant castle, or battle a pair of mechanical eyes with some amazing music playing during it. This entire concept is made better with other people, be the entire workshop (we'll get to that later) or multiplayer co-op or battle servers. The workshop expands this entire subject, as you can upload worlds that you're proud of or download worlds you think will be useful or neat to explore. Texture packs can also change the way you see the game, like texture packs that make some old sprites look newer and cleaner, or make some things more visually appealing, such as the jarless critters texture packs. All in all, amazing concept and deserving of all its praise and love."
23672,I've put a few hours into it. Great game!

23684,"Terraria, for me, was just like Minecraft was to a lot of people, a fun new experience where I could do whatever I wanted, all in a neat little 2D client. One of the [b]only[/b] flaws with the base game is that it gets repetitive after a while. However, the modding community for Terraria is insane, making the replayability value skyrocket. Do you want more cool and fun content separate from the base game? Calamity. Thorium, and Stars Above have got you. Want to play something completely different? Overhaul and RPG Classes are there for you. Need some more quality of life features? There's Magic Storage, Wing Slot, Recipe Browser, and so, so much more. Asides from the mods, you've also got really cool workshop capabilities, with the likes of texture packs, and also a great community and player base. Overall, the Terraria experience has been a blast, and is placed firmly into my top 3 games of all time."

23726,"Nearly 50 million copies sold worldwide | Labor of Love winner (long time coming) | 11 years+ of active development | 770,000 steam reviews 

There's a reason this game has been so good for so long. It's just in a class of its own. And not just to the general public, either. To me. Pretty much every single online friend I've made through steam or through discord has come from this game. I'm going to meet a friend overseas IRL next summer solely due to the connection we made through this game. 2,700 hours and counting have done unimaginable things for my life. This is, far and away, the best game I have ever and will ever play. It's saved me from suicide and gotten me through some tough times and been a source of entertainment, joy, and thrill over the years I've played it.

Thank you, Terraria, for everything you've done for me. I hope anyone who reads this is inspired to pick the game up and give it a spin. It has done a good thing."

23733,I like the music
23734,"Purchased this as a friend highly recommended it ... and ohhh boy was i glad. 

A platform game that you can enjoy solo and with friends, sinking in a couple of hours at  time without realising it. Out the door the door it had quite a steep learning curve but with the odd wikikguide, youtube videos you can pretty much learn as you go. 

Best in game help was the NPC's, particularly the ""Guide"" who tells you what you can build with any material(s). 

If on sale i would HIGHLY suggesting picking up the game - well worth the try :)

23754,"So far I have had alot of fun playing this, I am looking forward to exploring more and defeating more of the bosses!"
23755,"The game allows for full freedom between worlds, as items are saved to the character rather than the world. This means that if you begin running out of resources and you want to continue building something in your main world, you can collect resources from one world and bring them to another. Also, the creators are gigachads; ""Also try Minecraft"" --Terraria"

23799,"Great game, played for over a decade on other devices. I'm mostly used to the mobile version so I only have 1 complaint about the pc version. I really wish you could zoom out more than 100%, on mobile you can zoom out to 58% and it's on a smaller screen, so now that I've switched back to pc it feels REALLY zoomed in."

Many MANY enemy's to kill and die to and then bosses are very fun and difficult enough
When you feel like you can you can try a much harder difficulty, different world corruptions, and available mods."

23824,"An amazing game for all types of players. It can be hard, it can be modded, it can be played for hundreds of hours or just a few, It can be played multiple times before you start to get bored, you can even build some impressive stuff with enough practice. It is also still being updated. Doesn't need a really powerful computer .Also, it is very affordable and worth it's price.

Don't let the fact that this game is 2D draw you away from it. The people who call this 2D minecraft obviously didn't explore it very far. Like any other game, it could be improved but that's all player preference. Just try it out for at least pre-hardmode.

Beware of boulder traps and rolling cacti!"

23836,"When you get into it, it is a lot of fun !"
23837,yes
23838,I liked the edgy yet beautiful worlds. Game seems so tough without a wiki but this would definitely be a game I'd choose for a deserted island with all the different various world seeds and playing styles. A+

Terraria, what a great game!
One of my hands-down, favorite games!

If you enjoy the Action & Adventure, Open-World, Building and Crafting themes and if you are a fan of the Survival, Roguelike, Sandbox, Crafting & Farming and Metroidvania genres. This game is undoubtedly for you.

If you are unaware, Terraria is a 2D open world sandbox game, where there are no limits as to what you can build, fight, craft and explore. With a unique progressive system that allows you to move through the story whilst battling escalating bosses in difficulty and also acquiring better weapons, armors and materials, this should be a no brainer for anyone that got even a slight interest from reading the review so far.

With amazing 2D graphics, anyone can play with even the worst setups. Play alone, with friends, or even play with strangers on online servers! 

The Developers of this game are also really interactive with their community as they often listen to any feedback people have and apply it to their patches. Additionally since the game stopped getting major updates, the developers allow and even promote mods for the game, which I love because they give an even deeper experience!

In conclusion for $10, this is an absolute steal, and a gem of a game! If you haven't already, give it a shot and enjoy every second of your experience! You will not regret doing so!"
23843,awesome classic. Loved the mobile version and the controls are way better on the computer. Would recommend
23844,my hour count says all I need to say
23845,"This is game is so much fun. 

I had so much fun playing it and trying to get all the achievements. Currently stuck on the fishing ones but im sure ill get there."
23846,i want the soundtrack of this game to be playing at my funeral
23847,"Nerf the godamn Zenith
"
23848,"when i first started playing, i thought that this game was just a minecraft copy, but terraria is original and fun."
23849,very clear minecraft clone (this review means its a minecraft clone)
23850,absolutely worth the money. would reccomend at least 3 playthroughs before checking out the mods.

23978,best game ever made lol
23979,The play at your own speed is perfect for me. I can hunt down things to kill or mine or just explore.  I've only played solo so I'm missing out on a big part of the game.  That will come later most likely.  Just got a win 10 computer and it's running very well compared to my win 8.  You'll be googling a lot of stuff.
23980,"Very fun game it will keep you busy for a long time. Even after you beat Moon Lord (which I haven't)
Like most games its more fun with friends most of my time on here is playing in one multiplayer world with one of my friends. The game is 100% worth the price, I personally think its priced perfectly. I love the art style and all of the sprites are very well made. The bosses when defeated leave you with a sense of accomplishment.
I hope this review encouraged you to play this gem. (There is a lot I didn't cover I would recommend going to youtube for a more in-depth review of this masterpiece.)      : )"
23981,Lots of content if you like 2d exploration.  Definitely worth it.
23982,One of the most Impactful games I have ever played! If you haven't played It yet do so now! Your really missing out on a lot of fun if you have not played it.
23983,Cocaine is less addictive.
23984,it fine
23985,Almost 100 hours later and im addicted to this game
23986,"If someone says this is just 2D minecraft, heres a cheatcode. Punch, punch, kick, and dig a grave.
This is an amazing game. With literally incomprehensible possibilities, a very active modding community, references, its amazing. The world gen needs some work, and items get *old* after a little bit, but as someone who has like 100 hours on the console version, and about 14 (including tmod loader) on the pc version, its worth it with very low system requirements, (i play on a laptop) and a lovable cast."
23987,"pretty good game, would play"
23988,"I have interacted with many things in this game, and through thorough gameplay, I have come to the realization that there simply is no media as entertaining as this masterpiece. I must implore the reader, if they haven't already, to purchase this game. Thank you.

24070,"This is a very well made game. It is often described as just a 2D minecraft, but I would say they are quite different. The game can be quite confusing and complicated when going in blind, but once you get the hang of it, it's a really great game. I really like how this game allows so much freedom and it isn't too much of a grind! There's always things that can be improved, but nontheless this game has little to no flaws.
9.7/10"
24071,"I love Terraria so much. When I was younger I would play the kindle version on my tablet, then the console version on my ps3, but this is by far the best version. There's so much to explore, and you can play the game however you want. You want to build cool houses? Got it. You want to kill big bosses? Get to slayin'. I rarely get bored of this game, and I love all the features it has."

24101,"I'm about 1000 hours in across console and PC, and I can say with confidence that this is one of the best games i've played. period. The simplistic mechanic design lends an experience that hasn't staled in ~7 years for me, the interaction of Re-Logic with the fanbase is also phenomenal, creating something deeply personal, designed to create an intertwined feeling within people like me who adore it so much!"

IF you are into modding, there is also massive mod packs that people have released that give this game hundreds of extra hours in content."

24166,"If $10 is your budget for buying games, then definitely get this one. It's really good, or at least WAS really good for when it actually came out. Nowadays, not so much.

Pros:
* Very fun randomly generated world to explore
* Lots of enemies and bosses
* Different ""unique"" biomes to explore
* Crap-load of weapons (even if they're mostly copy-paste tier upgrade)
* Really good music

Cons:
* Enemies deal way too much damage. Early and late game. The time you spend upgrading your health, armor, and magic mean literally nothing, as the difficulty never curves out. It stays at ""bull****"" for the entire game. More than half of the enemies OHKO without the best equipment at your current level, no matter what part of the game you're at.
* Enemies have way too much health. Health sponge enemies are NEVER a good thing in video games. I'm sorry. Again, even with the best gear, the enemies of your current game progression take way too long to kill... and there's A LOT of them. In waves. Especially at night.
* The bosses are boring as heck. They have maybe 3 total attack patterns, one shot you, and take 20-30 minutes to kill in the same way - by cheesing the crap out of it. Extremely boring. The only good boss is the Wall of Flesh. The only one that actually takes some sort of skill and planning.

So again, this game is really grindy, you're going to die a lot due to cheap bullshit, and the game doesn't feel that much different through a 90 hour world. If you want this type of sandbox resource gathering thing, then just buy Minecraft. Minecraft sucks too, but at least it's fair."

Would love to see this game to be apdated in the future (yes i know a new update is coming and yes i know it is technically the last version). hope this review is helpful and would 100% recommend it to you

24231,"In my dear opinion, Terraria is far more than a game, it is an experienece a life-enchancing manifesto, the holy grail of peak games. I love every aspect of this game and Re-Logic, as they show that they listen to their fans and at this point even work with them to create a masterpiece like no other. By all good means, if someone needs a game for any reason, then this should be it. It is perfect. Great job"
24232,Pretty good ngl
24233,Good Game.

24249,... yeah. Probably the best game to come out in 20 years. You'll get your money's worth. Don't forget to mod when you're finished!
24250,afdsgdsdfad
24251,"I told myself I wouldn't review the game until I got a Rod of Discord legit, so I can safely say this game is fun enough to keep me playing for near 1k hours, and I finally got my drop. Very fun game, would recommend.
(For reference the drop is super rare from a mob that is very hard to truly farm)"
24252,who wouldnt play this game lmao its fire and if you have never played it give it a try im telling you i have thousands of hours on this game across platforms lmao
24253,yes

24266,"There's something about the simplicity of exploration and remedial tasks, like mining, that has always helped me when dealing with bad days. Whether from a crap day at work, to the nights I can't sleep with ptsd, I  have always found Terraria and Stardew to be my top two go-to games. If you like building, mining, or general exploring (or have buttloads of anxiety like me) I say give Terraria a try :D"
24267,very good game
24268,"Very fun, 5 stars, 10/10"
24269,"a fun game with almost infinate things for you to do. As in make homes, kill bosses (and players alike), and max out that ever class you wish to spec out into and your not forced by 1. do like me and branch out into mage or range, summons and more. and playing with friends multiplys this 10 fold! it makes it all the more fun and thats not all even tho the game might be dieing out that dose not mean you still can't play just like it may seem they don't work on it anymore dose not mean it's not fun I have played my fair share and still am playing this as we speak. Just bc a game is dieing out slowly dose not mean it's not fun to play. and i hope that if you read this and buy the game you will have just as much fun as I do and am having. and if you don't like playing old classic Terraria then you have TML (Terraria mod loader)  wich helps you with installing mods on you game and the best part is. This barly effects your save file makeing for a fun time with you and any of your buddys. In all terraria has come a long way from when i played and some times i look back and think Was this the same game? I'll let you think about it. But over all 10/10 game."

24292,"Incredibly well designed, the boss progression is incredible, as bosses scale to your movement and damage throughout the game. Exploring is lots of Fun, and if your a masochist, you might even enjoy exploring the jungle. Terrarias music is atmospheric and immerses you in this lovely 16-bit world, truly incredibly Re-logic, Truly incredible."
24293,The best game i have played. It is an amazing experience especially with friends and i would recommend this to everyone.
24294,"Have played for a lot of time, great game overall I can confidently say it is up there with some of the best games with tons of items, mechanics, bosses, enemies, NPCs and much more. There isn't a main story line but that is one of the best parts, you can just go around exploring your world finding new biomes with new materials, enemies, weapons, and sometimes bosses if you ask some people they will just say, ""It is just 2D Minecraft,"" but in reality they are quite different, but i wont get into that. Terraria is a great game overall and I would diffidently recommend. (Also, if you play on PC you have access to Tmodloader which is modded terraria for free with easily downloadable mods adding hundreds sometimes thousands of new things)."

24328,
24329,Good 2D game with lot of content and allow many different ways to play and progress
24330,e
24331,"this is my favourite sandbox game, for multiple reasons:

1. There is an actual goal and its not like ""do it because.. cuz""
2. the game has a lot of unique weapons, and let me tell you: they are all good and reliable at the point you get them
3. this game has 4 ""classes"": summoner (whips and slaves), ranger (Bows with different effects, Rockets, Bullet guns), melee (don't let the ""melee"" title fool you, they aren't melee their weapons range from pointy swords, trought boomerangs and yoyos all the way to a sword that shoots swords), and mages.. they.. use mana to do stuff from firing a gun that shoots homing bees, summoning a cloud that either rains blood or rain all the way to a crystal that shoots epilepsy at your enemies.
4. Multiplayer, its fun with some friends
5. lots and lots of game references, like a don't starve seed and a boss, Dungeon defenders event and turrets, yoyos representing real life ones.
6. Have you played trought the game? Time for a new dificulty! now introducing: expert mode, tankier enemies, new boss patterns, and all the bosses give more loot and a new item (just don't do master mode, its a pain.. everywhere)
7. Have you played trought the game in expert mode and almost commited suicide in master mode? Time for mods! raging from resource packs to a whole new game with twice as many bosses! (for mods, you need the base game and a free dlc called Tmodloader and right now its outdated)
8. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY THE GAME ALREADY!"
24332,play
24333,Very good and relaxing game(if you are not playing on master mod)
24334,Nice!
24335,GREAT GAME NUFF SAID]

24339,best game ever love it cheap realistic and fun to play with friends

24341,very fun game :D
24342,"This game is like Minecraft, but it has mods and stuff. Which is better than Minecraft. I recommend getting this game."
24343,yes it is a good game but tmodloader is better
24344,"An extremely good sandbox-survival game with lots of action and fun. Things you can do in Terraria is near infinite. You can build massive structures, create compact systems, do a rpg gameplay and more. Even if you get bored from all of vanilla content you can play with mods or even create one. And i must say that THIS IS NOT 2D MINECRAFT.

24382,Progression in the game actually feels rewarding and game has features that don't feel gimmicky despite being loaded to the brim with them. You can progress in the game with different classes of characters and strategising is optional as you can advance in any way you want. It has a decently hard difficulty spike at the beginning of hard-mode however you can work around it easily with some planning. Incredible game.

24422,"Simply one of the best sandbox survival craft games made. I've loved every play-through I've done and will definitely have more! Great price and has the potential for endless hours, especially if you bring mods into the picture"
24423,One of the best games I have ever played and would recommend everyone to play it so they know how i felt first time playing Terraria.
24424,"Terraria is a confusing experience.. its both hard and easy. Simple yet clunky (i just really hate contact damage..)..  Its a unique side-scrolling experience that has steps of difficulty as you play and defeat bosses.. that unlocked more scary bosses.. and so on. The game is both a builder, npc collector and dungeon crawler kinda in one. I found myself having fun exploring around, but i was also overwhelmed by everything so fast. It took a bit to get used to it. 

Combat is simple, building pretty things is kinda forgettable.. NPCs are mostly just there to sell you things, there is no 'real' meat of any story with them. They are less annoying to move around than Minecraft villagers at least. The biomes are actually what I liked most and the bosses were at least fun to fight. The game can be VERY challenging and seems like it'd be a lot of fun with a few friends. I only play with by significant other and we enjoyed ourselves while we did. 

I also just loved using Journey Mode and unlocking stuff to play around with building, slowing down the pace of the game so I could learn more on my own.. actually that's a great way to just 'get' the game. Its also a way to do things a bit faster if your life doesn't afford you a lot of time for games these days. I'm not a HARD MODE FIRST kinda person, but if you are.. oh you can do that too. Just dive right on in to insane difficulty and hope for the best. I like that the game just gives you options. It wants you to enjoy PLAYING the game as you want.

I can fully recommend Terraria as a simple survival-crafting game as it also is great for aging systems, as not all of us can afford to continue the upgrade scam, especially now a days. So, a light weight game, no real bugs to be had by just playing normally, enjoyable with friends on LAN.. yup- definitely a good pickup even if I'm super late to the party."
24425,"i played this game as a kid on mobile and i finally started playing on pc and it brings back so many memories, i highly recommend."

24486,Super fun game to share laughs and have a great time
24487,"Despite the many hours i have, Terraria is a good game, but i want to focus on the Good and Bad of the game personally in my opinion

Good:
Beautiful Visuals
Good Soundtrack
Perfect controls
Endless Creativity
and Endless replay ability

Sounds great right? Yes, but their are a some flaws i have with the game.

Bad: 
One important thing that i've been used to but want to say it, the game drags on forever. I know that's a common thing in this game but progression wise, it's very very very slow, doing all of the pre-game progression take a long time, building houses, finding treasure and digging a hellavator to the bottom of the world.

Addiction: Can't you tell from my hours? I spent 777.8 Hours on this game, for my enjoyment, i had fun, but it does not mean that i will again because I played this game way back in 2016 next to starbound. It means that i've been doing the same thing over and over again. From the eye all the way to the moonlord over and over and over and over again. But about the replay ability i mentioned, i know it's all about that but it felt like the same thing over and over again. Prepare for the bosses by building houses, find treasure in the underground and get life crystal's and organize everything at your chests, then fight bosses and get better weapons and items accessories, and the late-game is pretty much the same.

Bosses - If you say that i'm bad, no, i can beat all of the bosses during normal progression, but how the bosses are designed, is very questionable and very much poorly designed, going through one by one,

King slime jumps around and it's considered very easy,

Eye isn't very bad but has a unique pattern of learnable attacks

Eater of world is fine, may be me but sometimes spams the rotten balls at you.

Skeleton - fine boss but knockback is essential

Queen Bee - not bad but if you didn't build an arena, you lost

Goblin and Snowman waves are just enemy waves but minibosses are mediocre, same goes with the other events, those bosses aren't bad but barely require any skill.

by this point you'll have the shield which is very awesome since you don't have to worry about knockback anymore, unless you don't have it.

Wall of flesh - isn't bad but sometimes attacks are random.

Prime Trio: just Harder and more annoying bosses unlike their original states.

and as far as the rest they are basically the same as the other bosses i talked about expect some but it's the same.

That's about it, I recommend this game to anybody but if you don't like sluggish progression stay away.

Terraria gets a 7/10 it's a good game

This is pretty much the very honest review I ever gave to a game.

Terraria was still a very fond game of mine, but grew out of this game because of how progression/Grinding goes."
24488,"Its a fun and can be hard game
"
24489,"good gmae
yes"
24490,"Such a great game. 
There are a lot of games that are really fun on a first play through, but what makes Terraria worth it is it's replay value. This game has so much to explore and do. Especially with all the recent updates! 
On top of all of it's content it's such an easy game to mod and add even more! Some modpacks practically make a new game.
With plenty of hours I'd say it's worth the buy. %110"
24491,"""I can't do any more for you without plastic surgery."""
24492,It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun!!!!!!!!!!! I love IT!
24493,rlly fun
24494,"Literally everyone is going to hate me for this 

It's just a very bad version of Minecraft in a 2D perspective. 

It's heavily bloated with way too much content when it would be better if the game was just more simplistic.

Also combat is horrifically bad, sorry."
24495,what in god's name is with these spawn rates

24497,this game is awesome
24498,"cool

My steam account may only have a few hours recorded, however I have been playing since the PS3 release and I have well over 1000 hours played. This game is not only perfect for playing solo, but somehow even better with friends. I highly recommend this game for any and all age groups. If you are patient enough to learn the game, you will be rewarded with a gift that keeps on giving.

10/10 would recommend"
24555,"I've been playing this game for awhile now and I'm not going to go into specifics because you'll be reading an essay if I do.

Point blank; the game is 'okay', it's not great. Sure it has bosses, but the mechanics make the game generally particularly unfun to play either solo or with friends.

You only have two difficulties, what I consider ""Easy"" and ""Impossible at the Start""

Normal and Expert.

Normal is normal. Easy, pathetically so.

Expert basically takes the difficulty and cranks it up to about ""Insanity"" on most other games. Skipping Hard, Very Hard and Impossible to go directly into the hardest difficulty possible--it's almost as if the people who made that difficulty doesn't understand how difficulty scaling works.

Sure, you can heal with potions but using a single potion--or if you have a mushroom, eating a mushroom--puts you on a 60-second cooldown where you cannot use any kind of healing whatsoever. This is probably one of the worst healing 'balance' systems I've ever seen in a video game ever. Yes, it gives you a ton of healing potions but you're so limited on actually HEALING that you're going to literally have around 500 healing potions at the end of the game and not be able to use them properly.

The game is a platformer and when you encounter bosses, they'll have a thing where if you attempt to leave the combat they'll just instantly teleport on top of you, deal like their damage to you x5 because that's apparently how the developers thought boss fights should go. Or they'll go 'Enraged' and just one-shot you.

For as long as they've had to rebalance this game? I'm not impressed.

I've said it once and I'll say it again; others can enjoy this game, but this game honestly feels like a worse Starbound to me. I actually enjoyed playing Starbound. This game just irritates me constantly. I've never felt like I was cheated or robbed so many times as with Terraria, and I'm just done with it.

Get the game if you like the asthetic, but honestly I wouldn't consider this the 'best' game of its genre. Not even close to it, honestly. All it has going for it is boss fights and over-the-top items. That's literally it.

Nevermind the constant interruptions from invasions, day/night events, and constant bosses attacking you when you're trying to get things done--sometimes multiple nights in a row. More irritating than enjoyable or fun."

Extra Notes:

Terraria is a wonderful game. It's about you, a lone player, in a world of mobs filled with slimes, Vultures and Chimeras/Eater of worlds (there are WAY more mobs than what I stated, however those are the most notable ones in the early game). People who say this is a minecraft clone are only right in the way they are both creative sandboxes. 

Terraria's art style is impeccably gorgeous, spending hours looking at the background of the overworld while listening to the base soundtrack, It's a different experience, an experience I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone interested in 2D Pixel Art LONG games. 

The game's story may not be shone much, however like dark souls, you can piece what happens after every boss you go through. The game never leaves you wanting more, it's progression insanely balanced, same with it's enemy placements. 

For example, the moment you think you're extremely overpowered, the game brings you back to the beginning, building you up to bigger bosses, from Cthulu (spelt wrong im bad ok :( to Wall of Flesh, to Plantera to Golem (definitely a wrong progression order but that's all I could think of). Those aren't the only bosses though, there are dozens of bosses, enough to give you endless hours of content, even in the end-game there are plenty of opportunities to advance your character, to getting infinite flight time (Oh yeah did i mention there are wings?) to getting a flying UFO that can break blocks with over 6 lasers at a time! This game has something for everyone, and oh god don't get me started on the mods!

Mods are free to access from sources such as tModLoader, with the most notable consisting of Calamity, Tremor, Thorium, Magic Storage, etc. 
Mods add hundreds to even thousands of new items, hundreds of bosses, and add a whole new layer to Terraria's progression, and the world gen, like massive labs in the underworld.

Terraria World Generation is also great! There have been no anomalies as far as I'm aware, and the game itself is wonderfully built, on the left OR right side of the world there are dungeons (unanimous in all worlds), however where biomes such as jungles, hallows, etc are are randomised. Each world gives you a different experience.

The Terraria Tech.
Terraria also introduces multiple Technological aspects, such as actuators, wires, the Grand Design, and teleporters. They may be not as advanced OR as advanced as redstone, but they're enough to give a player a wonderfully hidden base by teleporting to the underground. They took time to design these features, and it definitely paid off in my opinion!

Terraria building.

I haven't named much of Terraria's building aspects, however every block placement sound is absolutely pristine to hear, and just building your own base from a couple of wood, stone and walls, is such an accomplished feeling. I dearly recommend, to anyone who is not into fighting or mobs, buy this game for the building. You can go nuts! I made a base that led from the underground with rails that flew into the sky with a cloud base, which had a teleporter to other parts of the map! You can build your base underground, in the sky, or even on the ground like a NORMI- jk.

Conclusion:

This review has had no cohesion, but I will say this. Terraria is a wonderful game for any one 3 and up. It is positively easy to understand, hard to master but wonderful to play for all ages. What you have to do is somewhat clear, and the developer team working behind this masterpiece of a game deserve all the credit they get. They listen to the community and actually input things in the games updates!"

24671,"Terraria is a really fun experience. Even starting a new character every now and then doesn't really get old because I always find a new way to play through the game with the different weapon types and such. I find it most fun when I'm playing with someone else and grinding out the bosses! Which, the bosses are arguably the best part of the game because of how cool they look and how challenging they can be, not to mention how good their drops are. I've had this game for years and I'm still having just as much fun with it as the first time I played it, even with the gained knowledge from each time. Overall I really love this game and recommend it to people who I think would really enjoy it."

24683,very good
24684,"Terraria is a sick game, I played since release, coming back to the game every once in a while. The last play through I did with this one was with friends on Master mode, it made for a very challenging, hectic experience. We beat it and the feeling of accomplishment was real. Modding in this game can add a ton to it too, I would say check it out if you're interested."
24685,This game is complicated to learn at first. but becomes very fun and challenging the more you progress.
24686,good
24687,just play it already
24688,This game is very interesting and an amazing experience to go in headfirst. I would recommend anyone who plays Minecraft or someone who plays games close to this the game.
24689,"Basic 2D Build-a-Base game, but the developer is consistently introducing more content. You generally need to start a new world to take advantage of said content, but that's no crime - it provides an incentive to start over from scratch."

24712,"Great game with or without friends, though I do advise not going in completely blind. Or do. You can build, there are various classes, and plenty of bosses to defeat. It's a great game and I definitely recommend it, but if you're not the biggest fighter, probably start out with a more seasoned friend first."

24727,"Graphics:
9/10 (some things feel out of place, but other than that. the pixel graphics style works very well here.
Gameplay:
10/10 (the gameplay loop in this game is very simple, it can be grindy at times but for the most part its vert straight forward.)
Grind: [1 no grind] [10 is awful grind]
5/10 (as said the game has grindy moments, say for boss summoning items. this isn't detrimental because they are only for optional bosses)\
Bosses:
10/10 (the bosses are a large part of what make this game great. they all are fun with challenge, but nothing feels impossible.)
Soundtrack: 
10/10 (the soundtrack is incredible. nothing more to be said, its all bangers.

Time for my opinion:
I've been playing terraria since 2013, getting the game on PC in 2016. Over this time across both systems I've gotten 4043 hours of total playtime. i know my way around things, I've always enjoyed action games and this is the perfect blend of action and adventure with fantastic sandbox mechanics.

If you want an amazing game to immerse yourself in for hours like i have. I highly recommend you get this game

Have a great day!!!

24812," One of the best games i have ever played, some may call it ""2D minecraft"", but its so much more than that as its a game about discovery you can discover items, find eastern eggs, and its one of the only games i found which lets you turn a shark into a machine gun, i have bought it a month ago and even after 200 hours of playtime, i am still discovering new stuff everyday (i am on my 5th playthrough right now).
don't get me started on how good and fun it is with friends, its way challenging if you have friends that dont know what they're doing as you need to kill bosses with multiplied health alone, but that's fun!
this game doesn't let you get bored, finished classic mode? try expert mode and get new tools and weapons, finished expert? try master to unlock even MORE weapons.
and even if you get bored from the real game, try mods! examples:calamity, polarities, thorium
if you like minecraft, give this a shot i promise you will like it.

the only thing remotely like minecraft is you can break and place things, the rest? yeah not minecraft

realistically you will end up sinking more hours than i have into this game 

and i also own it on the xbox one so that mark of 34.2 hours? thats for just steam...... its best you round it up to 135 hours of my life lost in the endless toys in this game 
a gun that shoots live bees? yes a ufo to fly in ? yes a wand that summons baby ufos that shoot lazers ? yes a axe you can spam toss like you broke all laws of physics? yuppppp these arent even the start of the weapons and toys in this game pretty much you will end up makeing a huge building just to store all your goodies

24834,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

24874,"i like this game, i play with friends, four of them. one was the mage, he kill me. one was MY class, which was swordman, because ME, I wanted the keyblade, and SHE JUST HAD TO RUIN IT. other guy was summonder, he had a many frog, horses. AND BEES. sorry caps lock, he was able to ride them me thinks, it was so based i got jealous and stole horse, he was not happy. carter, who has also left a review, was the bow guy, he was very good, he carried. he gave me all the ore, and khe kill all the bosses. eye one was very easy after a while, but very scary. we also fought meet wall, it was scarer because it had THREE EYES. but it had small chance of dropping cloud stride! so we fought a many times, just for me. i got my keyblade, and that was game complete. as that was my  a only goal. good game, i a very reccomend. it will make you shit your pant out of feat, especially when the hallow spawn RIGHT NEXT TO YOUR HOUSE. that was mot fun. we had to build a many wall all the way down to heck. wasnt cool."

24890,"I love this game the perfect survival based game in my opinion. it combines aspects from other games and takes much inspiration from other games out there with its various easter eggs and mechanics. that is to say this game is also very original i've searched for a while now to find a game like it and there is really nothing to compare it to. The only reason me and my friends don't want to play this game is because it's too adicting .

24946,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

25057,"Words can't describe how good this game is. There's so much content packed into this game, so many little references and jokes. It's very addicting, I've played for almost 300 hours and beat the game multiple times on each class and I'm still not bored. Even if you do get bored there's other stuff to try like different difficulties and seeds that change the game entirely. Whether it's on sale or not, buy it. Get some friends to join you and I promise you'll have a great time"

25182,4 Hours of gameplay and it made me addicted. . curse you game
25183,"Its a fun game where u can kinda do whatever you want to from building, exploring, mining, and fighting bosses.
It isn't the EASIEST to understand what to do all the time, which does mean that some people may get bored if they don't look at the wiki for a guide, but I love the game (especially the new journey mode where you can re-fight bosses on a harder difficulty for difficulty exclusive drops)."
25184,
25185,what other game allow you to fight a flying school teachers head with a nyan cat whip that plays the vine boom whenever you use it? Mods are amazing
25186,"I love everything about this game, hands down, man!

It's like minecraft but better, and MUCH harder. And everything wants to kill you. 
It's like a mishmash of different goofy and exciting ideas together, that just make it so much fun."

25199,nice
25200,It's fun
25201,"YES

25202,in my opinion the game is very fun

25208,"If you're looking for something a little more complex than Kingdom: Two Crowns but not quite as complicated as Dwarf Fortress, or not quite as boring as Minecraft, you might enjoy Terraria. The fact that it's still being developed after all these years speaks volumes about how much the creators have poured their heart into it."
25209,es bueno
25210,"good game,dont pirate
"
25211,"When I first tried to play Terraria, I rage quit with frustration due to the initial learning curve for all the new buttons combined with dying every time I tried to chop a tree or explore a cave. I gave up and went back to some old games, but I kept seeing a couple friends hopping into Terraria consistently.

I gave it another try, this time I was successful from the start, idk why I had so much trouble the first time...the controls are intuitive. Maybe I was having a bad day the first time I played.

After 400+ hours of vanilla Terraria, including earning 100% of the achievements, I still love this game and highly (HIGHLY) recommend it to fans of the build/craft genre.

Terraria is 11 years old and still receives regular updates from the development team. They listen to feedback and actively search it out on Reddit and Discord, with tons of features and changes coming from the player base. If you've been even remotely interested in Terraria, pick it up. If you enjoyed Starbound or Minecraft, pick up Terraria. Play through the game at your pace, be prepared to spend countless hours exploring, building, and fighting. If you only enjoy this game half as much as I did, you'll be overjoyed!"

25230,good
25231,"-Terraria is an amazing game; the only downside that would come to mind with a game like this would be single-player, but this isnt even a problem for terraria as there are countless playstyles one can go for; and they are all rewarded if played well.
But multiplayer is where you will  have the most fun; fighting giant bosses with friends, exploring dungeons; finding new bioms, etc... even though this game can be played and really enjoyed in single player, i would greatly recommend experiencing it with friends, especially considering the ""4-pack"" available in the store.

-something to know before getting started is that terrarias learning curve and advancements are not linear; they can be completed in different orders and the game will not outwardly tell you what to do, so watch some videos on the game and have the wiki at hand with you most of the time and your first playthrough will go smoothly.

-with all that said; i highly recommend it, it is a 10/10 game that i would suggest to anyone.

25329,"This Game Is Great For People That Like Minecraft And Risk Of Rain. In My Opinion The Game Does Need More Updates But In Its Current State The Game Is Magnificent.

If You Planing to buy this game and is reading reviews to see if its good, well heres why, when you start off in terraria's 2d World, you only have a pickaxe, axe, and a sword, but if you goes to either side of the map you can find caves with chest that give great loot. Now If your still not sure to buy but you love minecraft or risk of rain then you should love this, its 2d and you can mine pretty much anything like minecraft, and theres not much more I can explain without showing you."

25333,fun
25334,"pog
"
25335,"I was told that it was an easy game to spend hundreds of hours on. After playing it I've come to realize that its true but only because the devs wanted you to waste a ridiculous amount of time mining for the materials to kill the next boss. Once you kill the boss you start mining for the next. Lets say you fight a hard boss and die or it turns into day you will then have to wait another 20 minutes so the gameplay loop can start up again. This is a solid 10/10 plagued by inhereit game mechanic flaws. 

Solid 6/10 or something anywhere near that."
25336,play it
25337,boring!!!!!!!!! simple!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
25338,its fun
25339,If you haven't played this you are missing out big time.
25340,really like this game
25341,Very fun.
25342,"This game is amazing. Not only does it have such a wide expansion of weapons and armor to use, but there are also massive bosses to face and slay! The world you spawn in is the very beginning of a beautiful and wonderful place full of villagers, and critters but also endless depths of death. When you play Expert mode way to much (which is what I did) I felt like there wasn't anything difficult until Master mode came out, oh boy is that a way to die thousands without preparing. I honestly love this game to the bottom of my heart ever since I started playing it on my dusty Xbox 360 when it was first released and then on PS4 and then on my PC! I fully recommend this game to really anybody."
25343,"really fun progression, good boss battles, all of the good parts of minecraft except with an actually fun combat system, good story/progression, and more enjoyable gameplay. Such an awesome game"

Moss Hornets."

Having 1100 hours on this game, i can confidently say that this game is amazing. I would also like to point out that it is NOT 2D MINECRAFT. If you think that go play something else. Love this game 10/10"
25352,"It's great, too many issues with connecting to other players though"

25356,why do I hear boss music?
25357,Good gam
25358,"i like this game :) - a lover of chicken nuggets
"
25359,one of the best games i have ever played. I‚Äôve been playing on mobile since around 2014. when i got a laptop terraria was one of the first games i got. I would recommend 10/10
25360,"This game has repeatedly given back and asked nothing in return, I can't praise the developers high enough. Hands down one of my favorites, a must have."
25361,"Graphics: For a pixel 2D game this is great 7.5/10

Replayability: Depending on who you are, you could ""complete"" the game and reset and continue to replay it for very long time doing something different each run. However i'm not in to that really in to that 8/10

First time playing: If you are playing blind, You are overwhelmed with things to create and explore, meaning the first time playing generally makes you exited for the future and what you will become. that feeling is great 9/10

Content: I do not need a paragraph to tell you that there is SO much to do 10/10

Playing online: Having friends play with you in this game make the experience 2x better, what makes it 3x better is when you nor you friend don't know much about this game 10/10

Community: very nice people, but of course there is the fan fiction side of it... 7/10 

Mods: Meh. they create more content to the game, which is fine but the issue is the mods would sometimes add things that would ruin the original experience of the game.  I would recommend not going into mods until you have completed your first playthrough of the game 6/10

NPC's: The characters have a mindset of their own, meaning each person you meet in your journey will be unique to the others with different speaking style and things to sell which adds the feeling of the game being ""alive"" 7/10

My opinion: This is/going to be a gem in gaming history. My feelings on the game are, even after all of this, its ok. I am a hard person to please with video games and for 150 hours it was fun, but not as long as i wished for me to love it. My memories will never be lost with this game (my opinion:) 8.5/10

Final review: up there was my opinion, here i am putting what the game truly gets placed in

Drum role please...........................................................

9/10!"
25362,good
25363,i dont sleep
25364,"its fun

25446,"This game saved my life.

I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you Re-Logic."
25447,game fun
25448,"you should play this game, NOW!!!"
25449,:)
25450,Amazing game but it does take some time to learn the mechanic and crafting recipes since there is a ton of them take your time and google stuff that are materials for example any tool that is a material can be upgraded so yeah dont trash a lot of things they could be useful in future. I love the experience this game has to offer 10/10 would recommend.

You can build you own town and find the npc all over your map build cool 2d things. Some people will not like this game but i like it because it reminds me of a 2d minecraft and i find that hard unlike this game, it makes it handy to see what your about to run into and helps you navigate and find what your looking for in all sense if you want a game full of adventure and fun this is your game... have funnn"

25492,"What are you doing? This game is literally one of the best games released on Steam.

The game has a ton of re-play ability, and if you aren't interested in 2D games this one will spark that interest trust me.
There's so much stuff to do in such a small/medium/Large world. This game is addicting and the combat is always refreshing. One of the best communities out there too, especially the modding community which produced imo one of the best mods I've ever seen in video games. Like c'mon pick it up grab friends, the game is literally $10 and will give you 400 hrs at LEAST of addicting gameplay. Doesn't need a story or lore, it's just needs friends. Sure if you are completely new the start may seem a lil confusing, but they give you tools like the guide to help you craft and make whatever, it just takes a matter of time to explore the world you created."

25503,Can't wait for Terraria 2
25504,"This game is phenomenal.

Before I begin, thank you, Re-Logic for blessing us with this truly amazing masterpiece of a game.

--pros--
Hours of gameplay
Mods supported, many of which add more content
God tier soundtrack 
Many more that would take me hours to list out

--cons--
Slow start, easy to drop
Can be very frustrating 
The angler, enough said.

If you haven't already bought this game, do yourself a favor and do it already. For a low price of $10, this game packs hours upon hours of content into a small yet beautiful pixelated sandbox masterpiece. This game is held in very high regard, and for good reason, with unique and well designed enemies lurking around every corner. 

Terraria truly is one of the greatest games ever made, and I feel bad for everyone who hasn't had the pleasure of playing it."

25652,"this game is very good and worth it. I dont really want to write a full review, especially because there are already so many good reviews but Its good and it is very worth it for the price. also, if you even think about pulling a ""terraria is just 2d minecraft,"" you are wrong for so many reasons. Terraria has like 800 times the amount of content minecraft does and it is far more action packed and interesting. This is coming from a huge minecraft fan by the way. Anyway, very worth it. if you have a few extra bucks and you wanna have a good time, terraria is a very good choice. You dont need a very powerful computer to run it either. Im running the game perfectly on an intel i3, windows 360 hd gpu and 8gb ddr3 ram."

25654,I've had this game for 2 months and and I've put double the amount of hours in this game than another game I've had for 3 years and consistently enjoyed.
25655,"bought this game years ago, and it's still new. Just downloaded the golf course mod today - Fore!

25658,Funny block game
25659,"Good, love the game <3"
25660,"Its a more goal focoused version of minecraft.

The equipment/weapons give it a unique spin.

Bosses give you a reason to progress. (more than just 1-2 bosses)"
25661,good game
25662,First 2D game to be very fun even if you are playing alone
25663,i love it
25664,This game is incredible. But takes up so much of your time and is much funner if you play with friends. Overall would recommend if you dont have a life.
25665,great child-hood game
25666,"Classic fun for anyone who enjoys exploration, treasure hunting, caving, and battles. There's also golf now!"

25668,"Truly a testament to what even a smaller studio can do to make their game better over time. I played Terraria when it first came out with friends, we beat it once and they all were set, I dabbled a bit more before putting it down. I remember comparing Terraria to Starbound, which came out around the same time and is a very similar title, and thought Starbound was a more polished entertaining game at the time. But revisiting this comparison even years ago I found that since Terraria devs had kept patching and improving their game (for free I might add) it was leagues ahead of what Starbound had formed into and stayed as. I remember hearing about a patch that added some new content (1.1 on December 1, 2011) to find some really awesome changes but not enough to replay the game for. Later on I again stumbled upon the news that Terraria had received another patch for more content (Patch 1.2 on September 30, 2013). At this time I was shocked to find this added almost X2 the content to the original! Along with the lovingly thought through changes and improvements to UI, sprites, world generation, items and crafting system, bosses, events, mounts, etc that really brought the game forward from its original release I fell in love again. Playing through the game again with fresh eyes after not really playing since the release 2 years ago I was in for a treat. Terraria has an AMAZING feeling of progression through exploration of the world and crafting system, which also goes hand in hand with boss progression and even the world changes to make it feel less static (which I find is an issue in these procedurally generated world games). Re-Logic has even added more content over the years which just leaves such a nice warm feeling as a player to see a dev love their project and continue to improve it. I think Terraria is one of the best games ever made, not just in its genre. The level of polish and standard that has been achieved over the years really brings Terraria to a prolific place on a pedestal compared to what it started as in 2011."

25685,Amazing
25686,Great game! allows you to play with others across the world and use a HUGE amount of mods with tModLoader!
25687,very epic
25688,"The mixture of rpg elements with building and crafting in a 2D world blends perfectly in this game. I have played hours and hours without ever being tired of it. Add to that the loads of fun you can have with friends here, almost endless vertical progression regarding items and unique in-game events and you have, by my standards, one of the best games I've played. 

Most importantly, Terraria's price tag hasn't changed with all the new additions, no expansion content is paywalled which is trully astounding if you consider that the devs have been working on Terraria for over 10 years."
25689,good game I accidentally got Infinity +1 Sword achievement by having my friend give me his Zenith

25754,Masterpiece of a game. If you have not played it you are missing out.
25755,"I have played since the beginning. This game has such great memories for me and my friends. I played this game religiously middle school thru college (in my second year right now). This game never fails to make me and my friends smile and have good times. They say this game is ""like minecraft and boring"" but that is not true. This game is so much more. I highly recommend this for anyone with friends who would do this with you."
25756,its great
25757,Would not suggest. This tears friendships apart.

It's just too fun, and I really was sad to see that the last major update was rolling out when I got back into playing it when covid rolled around. Thanks Terraria, much cool, very appreciate."

25829,Terraria is one of the best sandbox / RPG games out there. The procedural world is lots of fun to explore with many unique biomes and structures. There are hundreds of weapons that can combine with armor and accessories to make unique builds. The game can be ruthless at times but is also lighthearted and playful. There are a ton of references and Terraria can be quite funny at times. Completing the game can take upwards of 40 hours and it is very replayable. Highly recommended especially at its great price point.

25918,"Absolute masterpiece. That's the only word to explain this game as a whole.

But seriously though, I have a lot to say about this game, so this review will be pretty long and will also be followed by an explanation of why you shouldn't compare this game to Minecraft. If you're wondering about the little playtime I have, I've already played this game a lot before I actually bought it on Steam. Don't ask how I played it, I don't wanna break any piracy rules here. Just buy the game and support the devs because the devs actually care.

[b]Below the main review are pros and cons. Skip to the bottom of this review if you don't want to read essays.[/b]

When people see this game from the outside, they usually think that Terraria just looks like a 2D Minecraft rip-off due to how similar its style of gameplay is at the beginning and its sandbox features. However, I personally think Terraria isn't your usual sandbox, and it has something to do with its long term progression, I would argue that this game leans more towards the RPG side, although it's not totally an RPG.

[h1]Long-term progression[/h1]
One of the most exciting aspects of this game is its long term progression, and despite having a limited world unlike Minecraft being infinite, there are so much more biomes to explore and so much more enemies to fight, including bosses. A reason people might find this game boring is its grindy nature, but that's like 80% of Open World Survival games out there. People generally shouldn't be using that as a reason to criticize this. Despite being pretty grindy, it's not to the point where it takes away the main enjoyment of the game, because the satisfaction you get when you finally get what you want in this game is immense. There is so much layers of discovering, exploring, and fighting, and this is exactly what makes this game so fun, it's VERY experimentative (if that's even a word) and tests your patience a lot.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
Apart from its RPG-like elements, there's also the combat mechanics. Having multiple classes adds a lot of layers to the game's combat difficulty, as you get to experiment and learn more about different styles of combat and how you can use it to your advantage against monsters and bosses. A lot of the weapons always seem to have its own fun and exciting feature, with some of them obviously having its own limits at the same time to test your own skill rather than just purely relying on grinding.

People may complain about the game being too hard at times, which I can agree on when it comes to bosses and some biomes with really strong and overpowered enemies. When it comes to bosses, I don't see it as a problem since majority of games out there will always have one or multiple bossfights that are really hard to beat, which is part of what makes a game good while also making sure you get a good amount of satisfaction afterwards. However, when it comes to some biomes containing multiple strong enemies, they're honestly even more frustrating than fighting bosses especially when you're grinding for items.

While I understand that the game may be trying to test your own patience and skill, I don't really agree on having the player die multiple times without giving an open chance on how to figure things out. You are almost always guaranteed to die when you get cornered, there's multiple enemies, or some enemies might be too fast to dodge, so I feel like they should've toned down the immense difficulty by a bit. I do agree that the fun of it comes from the satisfaction of being able to succeed at something really hard, but personally not really to the point where it's just no longer newbie friendly, since there's no longer any enjoyment left on that part, just pure frustration. This isn't something that affects my enjoyment, but rather something that may affect someone else's enjoyment especially when they're not really the best at playing games.

[h1]Why you shouldn't compare this to Minecraft[/h1]
It gets me a bit triggered whenever people compare this to Minecraft or just simply call it 2D Minecraft, the 2 games are way more different from each other than what you are imagining. Terraria focuses more on adventuring and long-term progression. It's pretty clear with the almost infinite amount of items this game has. Minecraft can be quick and boring for people, simply because survival mode doesn't really have a lot of things to offer when compared to other longer games, but still enjoyable in its own right. I personally think the fun from Minecraft comes from its freedom, building, and multiplayer servers.

By freedom, it's more something to do with creativity which is also related to building. Minecraft is more ""free"" and casual than Terraria, which is full of really hard and long-term combat and progression. This is generally the reason why I would just recommend Minecraft than Terraria when it comes to playing something ""calming"", because Terraria is not a calming game at all. If you can't handle frustration, go play Minecraft since it might lean more towards your taste. Building is more enjoyable in Minecraft because it's 3D, it allows for a more experimentative type of building. Terraria has its limitations in building cool stuff because it's 2D, not to say that you can't make cool stuff in this game. Enjoyment varies from different types of games, and these 2 games are completely different types for different people.

Multiplayer servers are also something I find more fun in Minecraft. This is mostly because of how active the Minecraft community is when it comes to making servers and also the amount of people that play in them. While Terraria can have some pretty fun games in multiplayer servers, they are very limited and is not as wide as Minecraft's multiplayer, mostly because people tend to play more singleplayer in Terraria than they do multiplayer, which is something that people mostly play on Minecraft.

I am going to conclude this review by writing pros [+] and cons [-] for people who would rather not read long essays. They are followed by short explanations, but you don't need to read them if you just want a peek of what this game offers.

[b]Pros[/b]
+ Long-term progression. There is a lot of exploration and adventuring that tests your patience and ability to discover and experiment
+ Good combat that has multiple layers of skill, though can be a bit grindy when it comes to collecting weapons and accessories.
+ Good soundtrack. This isn't something I covered in the review, because I don't have a lot to talk about it. It's fun and calming to listen to while playing.
+ Still fun despite being grindy, as you can progress without relying too much on grinding but more on exploration.

[b]Cons[/b]
- It's, well... grindy. If you're wondering why I also have this as a pro, in this case it's mostly a problem with difficulty. You can progress without this but it's hard as hell. Generally a problem for the more casual players.
- Fighting enemies can be a bit too unnecessarily frustrating, which is generally a problem related to grinding as well since you have to fight long waves of endless enemies to get what you want. Difficulty of some enemies can also be a problem.

Thank you for reading this review all the way to end, unless you skipped to the end. Just kidding, thank you for reading nonetheless."

25921,"Pretty good game, lots of replay value with a randomly generated world and different classes to choose from. A lot of people don't mention that this game is pretty chill when you just spend time building houses and shit. You dont have to fucking murder every boss.
 I've still not even tried to fight queen slime or the other hollow boss, but ive beaten the game on PS4 pre 1.3. I give this game 2 thumbs ups out of 2."

25955,"When I first got into PC gaming in 2015 I looked at terraria and said ""what a stupid concept to make a survival game 2D"".....I love this game...this game had everything I love, crafting, building, boss fights, exploring, and no time system that really hinders play style (unless you let certain biomes go unchecked). If you like survival crafting then this is the game, but I'm sure you already know about Terraria"

25972,"Y'know that moment when you're lying awake in bed at night because there's a fly in your room and it keeps ramming itself against your window and as it mutilates itself it makes this horrible thumping noise against the glass whilst aggressively convulsing? Yeah, Terraria has that feature, except instead of flies, it's eyeballs."
25973,very good
25974,"yup, its a game"
25975,w game
25976,I have enjoyed Terraria for many years and it has been the top of my list in terms of games I love. This game has so much engaging content and can be played for a long time without running out of activities to be done. There are many different challenges that have come out for Terraria and many different speed runs as well. I have enjoyed this game for my many hours of playing and I would absolutely recommend this to new players.
25977,among us fun game honestly gud game and also i want to say that i really like this game then i want to say you are gay lol also i want to say i fail also i want to say i like big boys i also like monkeys i also like black people i also like kfc i also like popeyes i also like big pp i also like csgo.among us fun game honestly gud game and also i want to say that i really like this game then i want to say you are gay lol also i want to say i fail also i want to say i like big boys i also like monkeys i also like black people i also like kfc i also like popeyes i also like big pp i also like csgo.among us fun game honestly gud game and also i want to say that i really like this game then i want to say you are gay lol also i want to say i fail also i want to say i like big boys i also like monkeys i also like black people i also like kfc i also like popeyes i also like big pp i also like csgo.among us fun game honestly gud game and also i want to say that i really like this game then i want to say you are gay lol also i want to say i fail also i want to say i like big boys i also like monkeys i also like black people i also like kfc i also like popeyes i also like big pp i also like csgo.
25978,"Great game
"
25979,Honestly one of the best games I have ever played. Masterfully crafted. Also great soundtrack
25980,"Alright, I can't express enough how amazing this game is and how much fun I have had playing it with my friends throughout the years, and even before I got it on steam, and before I even got a computer I still played it on my Xbox, and so many people when they first look at it they say, ""its just 2d Minecraft"" But it is so much more! It is so much fun to go around searching the world and discovering new items, accessories, and weapons, then fighting bosses to test your new gear and progress through the game. And once you feel you can stand up to all the mobs, and have such good gear, so you decide to face the waffle(wall of flesh) and win, you are hit with so much more content when entering hardmode. Discovering so many new bosses, items, and ores, while you old gear and weapons can hardly stand up to the new mobs and bosses. And then once you beat the game once, you can try expert, or master mode, and even try out Tmod loader to make the Terraria experience better, and introduce new bosses and items into the game. Overall, I have had a blast playing this game throughout my life, and it has got to be in my top 5 favorite games of all time, and after years of playing it, I still play it with my friends till this day, so I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes survival sandbox games, or to anyone who just wants a really good game to enjoy with their friends."

25988,"Terraria is honestly an amazing game in my opinion, a lot of things are enjoyable in this game, such as the boss battles, and I also really like the mining aspects of Terraria. all in all, Terraria is a game I would recommend to anyone who can afford it."

25997,"yes
"
25998,"I don't know if I could recommend this game enough. I don't know how many times I've played it, but every time it feels fresh and exciting. I don't think that there is a single platform where this game is bad. If you are willing to set aside at least 30 hours, then buy this game. For the low price of 10 dollars I cant recommend it enough. If you have friends the experience gets even better. This is in my opinion, the greatest game ever created"

The feeling of exploration. hours of grinding that I enjoyed every moment of, looking through the wiki like a damn architech, it's a really genuinely amazing game I cannot reccomend enough. Going in blind or with wild spoilers, journey or master, solo or SMP, this is a game I think everybody needs to experience at least once.

26054,"Every fabric of my being hates this game, yet i still play, there are so many enemies that invoke a seething rage within me, all of which make me want to eat glass, these include:

-Every single bat, why are there so many bats
-the spiked jungle slime
-the snatcher
-the giant tortoise

aside from these spawns of satan (all of which i am convinced came from the mind of a heroine addict) the game is incredibly fun to play again and again
but the fact that these enemies still exist are enough for me to not recommend this game
9/10 i want to stick my dick in a blender

26112,"I have been playing this games since the 4th grade and now I am in high school and I still keep replaying it. The different classes allow you to play this game over and over again. This is by FAR one of my favorite games of all time, maybe my favorite. I highly recommend this game to anyone who comes across it. Its even better with a group of friends. With everyone going their separate ways to gather gear and coming together to fight a boss just feels so amazing and grand. And it's only $10. This is the greatest 10 dollars you will ever spend."

26118,"I have spent far too many hours a slave to the people, fishing. I whisk away after spending all day fishing to not obtain the one item i need. Im afraid this will not be the end of my fishing due to the exclusive items, but as i grow old catching the same shitty fish over and over again i can say with gusto that i wasted my youth fishing on terraria."

26124,"As someone who spends far too much time playing games, I can safely say there are few better than this. I've spent thousands of hours on Terraria from PS3, PC, PS4, mobile and Switch. The gameplay is heavily repeatable, with each new run-through giving an exciting experience. 
The actual gameplay is incredible. The boss fights, mining, building and exploring never bore me even with after all this time. It can be a thrilling, action-packed game if you want it to be, or it can be relaxing, but it will always be joyful. The game follows your pace perfectly, and with each new update the pacing of the game gets even more perfect when i thought it was already perfect.
The work put into this game by Re-Logic is admirable. After all the time Terraria has been out its been improved and improved and improved countless times, all for free. The game I first played in 2013 is completely different to the game it is now, yet it also isn't as the joyous charm you feel playing the game hasn't changed one bit.
I can literally not think of a single negative for this game. Too addicting?? Too fun??
I'd highly recommend this game to anyone, whether an expert gamer or casual. If you don't enjoy it at first just give it few more hours (reach hardmode) and you won't regret it."

26126,"expected 2d minecraft, got that and so much more!"
26127,No words I just wanna give it a good review lol
26128,you should play this game its well made i could play it all day if i could i would let you know you should try it out

26135,"This might just be one of the greatest games ever made. The gameplay is fun, the items are unique, and most everything that you can do is engaging. Do you like to build in your games? Terraria has it. Like fishing for some reason? Terraria has a lot of it. Do you like bosses? Terraria has, in my opinion, some of the most well designed bosses to ever be incorporated into a game. Everything from the music to the enemies has it's own unique charm. The game is beautifully made, and with over 4,000 hours on record as of writing this, I have thousands of memories of playing this game. The nostalgia is amazing, but the game holds up incredibly even when you look past it. I have so much to say about this game and maybe I'll make a more comprehensive review in the future, maybe at 5,000 hours, but for now, all I can say is that this game might have the most bang for your buck in terms of content out of any game on steam. And if not, it's definitely up there for me."
26136,"This is a really great and time consuming game! If you enjoy Minecraft then this is similar. One thing though, the crafting is pretty confusing. You can't see the ingredients you need to craft something so you have to guess or search it up. Overall, excellent game!"

26152,Fun. And. Good. Except the Angle screw him. He's the only reason I haven't got 100% achievement.
26153,"Best crafting survival game, though less family friendly than Minecraft. If you're looking for something with better bosses and enemies and a buttload more content, though, terraria's the game."

A ton of loots & bosses, also theres gear builds to specialize in."

26180,"Terraria is a fun game filled with bosses and a lot of loot, weapons and accessories to power up"
26181,fun
26182,"best game ive ever played
"
26183,"Hands off, this is the best game. You can play for 10 hours straight and not get bored."
26184,"impeccable progression, delectable combat mechanics, exquisite customization. fun alone and with friends."
26185,funny pixels
26186,"Funny Minecraft Copy hahahaha.
But no seriously Terraria is a cool and awesome game, it may be confusing, but with friends and skills, it's super fun!"
26187,amazing woooooooooooooooooooooooo
26188,This game just gets better and better with age and updates. So much love put into one game! Can't recommend enough!
26189,it is fun but very hard :)
26190,good shit
26191,"get tmodloader. get QoL mods. get mods that make vanilla items craftable. this game fucking sucks with how much needless grinding and searching there is for needlessly rare items and items with ludicrously low drop rates. that kind of shit only exists to pad out your play time.

otherwise the game is pretty good. its disappointing that the game only starts getting REALLY cool right around when the lunar events happen, then its over. my point is go play calamity mod."
26192,good but i dont think ill be playing this game that much its not that fun
26193,"vary fun
"
26194,"I have a addiction please help please, please please send help i need to get out of the terraria addiction i need to go outside its been 5 days. my life now is wake up, terraria sleep. Thats it no food no water just terraria. its all about the grind for that thing you know that thing. Morbius is the great. Truly the best cinema has to offer, I never expected a live action movie of Scooby Doo to hit me harder than my da-I mean, harder than my failing grades. Truly the best the Forza franchise has to offer with unbelievable graphics stunning visuals, Amorbus really shows you how Walter White who lives at 308 negra arroyo lane thinks by cooking cocainer and getting stage 4 terminal cancer(weird I always thought that was a zodiac sign). Watch as Jesse Purpleman completely causes a bathtub to disintegrate using his makings of a varisty athlete which is also shown by Tony Soprano whom decides to get into a car crash caused by a blown tire which was invented by 7 time Piston Cup Champion, Lightning Mcqueen(Owen Wilson was suspected to be the same person as mcqueen but clearly they are nothing alike). Gran Turismo 7 will show you how a sim racer can simulate everything except my 1 braincell struggling to type this out, truly the pros of this show never stop with so many good things happening such as the end credits. Truly this show exposes Hololive and how Yagoo may be the best girl but it's a long shot,  however  I wholeheartedly believe that all good things can happen with longshots like the sniper that I wish blew my heas off midway through Morbidly Obese. Truly I have no complaints about the latest installment of the Halo Franchise, Halo I can't Reach the top shelf which I think comes after Halo Infinity gauntlet wielded by my favourite superhero Josh Bowling. Lewis Hamilton holds the record for the most race wins in Formula One history, with 103 wins to date, his latest win was achieved in a car(unexpected!!).  Truly Lewis shows how hammertime can be achieved however  Max Verstoppen won the f1 world championship over him in 2021 by throwing pit cars at him summoning his stand Michael Massi, as you know standing was invented by Jojo's Bizarre Adventure before this people could not stand, much like how my thumb can't stand
typing this like Kendrick Lamar after Franklin tells him he can't stay at his crib this angers Kendrick Lamar causing Kendrick Lamar to say Franklin shouldn't hate Kendrick because he is pretty and calls out that if Franklin got of that terrible haircut and how his counterpart may contact him via telephone thus contacting him and stop having sexual intercourse with a brain surgeon or lawyer. Thus a movie with many layers like a onion or a ogre. Whoever said this movie was the greatest installment of the Diary Of Wimpy Kid, you are wrong because morse code clearly is worse than Diary Of A Wimpy Kid:Rodrick Rules. Clearly they captured the essence of that flim but missed the mark slightly. Thus I conclude my review on Morbidly Morbus Amogus  Amorbus A bus, simply wonderful with incredible gameplay and a surreal experience provided by the IMAX theatres that'll take your breath away like Berlin's hit song ""Take My Breath Away"" from the hit movie Top Gun which takes place on Earth which morbius doesn't since morbius takes place in New York often confused with Earth and along with Mississippi. All in all great soap opera  I enjoyed the orchestra and thoroughly enjoyed the Kayne West concert in which he played Fellas In Paris 11 times in Paris for over 40 minutes I rate this a ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) out of ‡∂û.
I cried when Mobius and venom said ""its morbin time"" and proceeded to become venom,also My good friend bryant moreland was also there , (he is known as EDP445) ""And he didnt really do anything wrong just so everyone knows he is innocent and just wanted a cupcake."" because we are venom , and then I started crying when venom teamed up with morbingus and killed spider man from the hit game among us, And then the among us imposter came into the scene and killed scooby doo and fortnite for possesion of illegal drugs , Than lebron james and among us team up with venom and morbingus to take over the world of the space jam, and than after that Rkelly and sonic2 attacked them and then they almost died but morbiobus and lebron james welcomed them to the space jam, and then they played the game team fortress 2 , which was developed by valve who owns will smiths children and family, who I have in my basement steam, After this the movie seems over and calm until the red sus from among us comes from vent and says ""among us sus"" which almost kills venom from the hit movie space jam a new legacy, I also liked the part when venom nukes russia and ukraine and morbiobusbus attacks ukraine with stinky poop, which was kinda scary but honestly I think lebron james and R kelly were great heroes and villans, And then hitler comes back from the dead and tries to kill bee movie, and then among us poo saves bee movie from hitler and they are saved. Morlibbingorbgarfieldiarywimrkellbious was so good and I was so suprised when dwayne ""the rock"" johnson appeared, (stars in jungle movie ) And eats the imposter and says ""among us challenge number 7"" than among us challenge number 7 commences and than number 6 man urinates on a fellow passenger attacks Dwayne ""The rock"" Johnson and his twin brother barack obama who starts brutally killing number 8  and kanye east which made me cry fart and scream
at the same time. I think garfield and among us were a pretty good duo as they were both sussy, and garfield does not like mondays as shown in the hit show 1000 pound sisters and then the sus from among us starts having a moment
where venom and kendrick lamar sings the hit song called venom by the popular rapper eminem which goes like this ""venom, venom, venom, venom"", and dies, It was so sad when jeffrey epstien and lil mosey died because his cameo was so good. I think this sheds good light on diary of a wimpy kid game six where the kid and EDP445 are against Michael Jordan in the 92-93 nba season. Such a great movie, and I have never seen something this great before,h I got kicked out of my job for ""workplace harassment""  I was just trying to explain how morbiobus was the best thing to ever be made by human kind, Cant wait for my restraining order to be lifted so I can see my kids again. im sorry laura please let me see my son ""its been 6 years im not crazy, im just a morbster and you have to accept me for that please let me see my kids and watch the hit game among us in movie form with morbious laura im sorry . Its morbin time, and I love among us so much and I want my family back,also, eddie brock, and venom who combine into venom and say their hit catchphrase ""we are venom"" and start yelling welcome to the space jam I actually died for a couple seconds and got send to the ER but once on the hospital bed, I got up and ran out as I had to see morbingus and kanye west pooping in 1080p ultra hd if i did not i knew i would die  and I wont pretend that I am morbious and start rolling around the floor with explosive diarrhea again, and I will not use the kids as hostages in any more among us poo #morbioussweep please rate helpfull"
26195,The open world and adventure of terraria is so vast that you can go hours on one world or make multiple playtroughs of the same character
26196,fun
26197,it so awseome
26198,"the game is actually pretty fun, the bosses can be pretty difficult, but with a good strategy and good weapons it can be easy! definitely a 10/10 game. i recommend trying it out."
26199,good game but I hate the walking fishies. so. much. please delete them
26200,fun game but just a game not for me!
26201,"For people that have recently bought this game thinking it might be fun, I'd like to tell you how to find that fun while also progressing. When creating a character and world, choose classic and corruption. The Terraria Wiki will help you out a bunch btw. In early pre-hardmode, things'll be kinda tough, like the EOC or EOW, but if you grind enough you will make it through the top. Same with hardmode, it'll be hard at first, but know what to grind and what not to grind for and you will succeed. You might also want to pick a class. I recommend Mage because it's has a challenge while also being strong as fuck. Great game, I really recommend it to creative people who just wanna massacre some shit"
26202,"this game is a very fun experience and i am frankly addicted to it, if you're ok with grinding a pretty chill game i recommend this 100%"

26258,Ive been playing this game for god knows how long from mobile to Xbox to phone again and then now on my PC and let me say from playing this game as a 8 year old to now so long ago and seeing how much this game has evolved and grown i can say without a doubt for anyone looking at review i rly suggest this game it offers such a wide verity of weapons bosses secrets lore and more. don't think about how its 2D that just makes the game more unique and special. i've been on a grind with this game from even before moonlord and some of the other bosses were released and with that play that game and learn for urself what the amazing grind of this game feels like bc at the end of the day you feel so good getting off the game and seeing how far u got.
26259,very pog
26260,"[h1] One of the best on Steam [/h1]

[b]Terraria offers what many games that are ""survival/craft"" lacks, leading to boring or simply no drive to finish the game, and i have a list to mention:  [/b]
[list]
 [*] A lot of enemies and i'd say 75% of them are unique.
 [*] Unique events that brings different rewards and even the ones not necessary to proggres are detailed.
 [*] A huge(and i mean huuuuge) quantity of itens that you can use to your liking on gameplay and visual.
 [*] There's progression in game is smooth and offers a challenge appropiate to the difficulty selected.
 [*] Progression based in skill/knowledge is also a big thing, leading to many strats/different ways to play.
 [*] Day and night have actual impact in the whole game.
 [*] Multiplayer is fun, has total support for it, and for me, it's the only mining/farm game that doesn't feel like a drag to get 
      everyone to have their itens.
[/list]
[hr][/hr]

[u]I dare say that it's blocks are more diverse than in Mine, with different building methods based on biomes and all that.[/u]

I have 257 hours on this game and currently have a job (let's keep it like that), but I would like to detail my world(s), challenge myself and much more if I had more time.

[u]The only setback i can think for this game, is for people who get things a little slower, or really small children (supposing both are going to play alone) because the learning curve on the beggining is a little by yourself. [/u]

[h1]If you are not in the above, Terraria is a must experience on Steam. [/h1]"

26267,"this game is a masterpiece!, this game has evolved in such a way that i cant even fathom it, the game has completed one of the hardest aspect of all games in my opinion and that is difficulty scaling, like you thought u got stronger after killing a boss NOPE u have to get stronger and after becoming the strongest pre hard mode u kill wall of flesh and suddenly everything u have achieved is thrown out, which just gives the playthrough back life and excitement! and dont even get me started on the building and the M U S I C, this game has the most banger soundtrack ever, every song fits for every boss battle and enviroments, and the modding community just takes that and just elevates it to a whole different level this game is a 10/10 masterpiece and i would recommend for everyone even if your alone or with friends you have to give this game a try.

thank you for listening to my TED talk."

26280,Amazing sandbox game with an emphasis on fighting tough enemies and bosses. The harder game modes are challenging and rewarding. Tons of items to collect and help you increase your strength and there is even a large community dedicated to building unique structures and art. The devs are constantly updating and improving the game even after they‚Äôve said they‚Äôre done multiple times. Very simple to get into game while still being deep and complex as you get into it. I highly recommend anyone to play this game. TModLoader has also been released to add more longevity to the game.

26283,"Terraria is well known game. So you surly know a bit about Terraria. honestly I don't even know what to type, but it's worth for price. On top of it you can mod it as you like. Devs addad on steam terraria moding version.

Funny, Devs announced us, that they will realease final update, yet we get more updates of content :D"

26290,"once you figure out how to play the game you'll got stuck for grinding. once you're in you're in. also great game overall really reccomend it to people who like to adventure and rpg type of games, it'l needa huge effort to keep grinding and defeating bosses to get the gear u wanted, just aquired a zenith, such op sword, it's really rewarding for such hard grind"
26291,Yes!
26292,good
26293,"Terraria is definitely a game I SHOULD have picked up years ago, an excellent game.
The replay-ability is incredible, seemingly endless, the amount of content brings thousands of items to collect and use for combat or just decoration. in addition Terraria continues to update to this day and brings exciting updates that improve the game and its enjoyment. The hundreds of different monsters ranging from minions, enemies and bosses bring an added challenge especially with more harder difficulties, but the more you traverse your world, the more you can uncover secrets, loots, friendly NPC's and items that can help you in battle.

Terraria is definitely a video-game gem that deserves it's recognition. I recommend this game to those who enjoy a world of the unexpected that can bring a challenge, or those who just want to play a game with some buddies, regardless it is a gem worth playing."

26329,why
26330,played this game cracked for a while until the 1.4 uptade where i tried playing with people. As a person who likes to do small detailed stuff and organize things this was a very nice experience. One of the biggest upsides was that it could run on almost any potato pc on atleast 30-45 fps so i got to experience the game with a pc that was older than me the first time I played the game on pc. 10/10 would reccomend
26331,
26332,"I have not played so much of the game yet, mainly the preliminary aspects of the game making me a beginner in the mechanisms. However, I'd like to say. In my opinion, I enjoy the multiplayer aspect when compared to other exploration/team-building games like Minecraft, No Man's Sky or Far Cry. Even though others can argue that those games are better since they incorporate 3D. Yet, I enjoy Terraria as it has more bosses that require better gear to defend against (good for multiplayer), better lore and etc. Though, this game was released back in 2011, it still brings smiles and joy to the players around. Thank you."

26349,"best game ever, 2nd to Minecraft"
26350,"i played this a bunch on console with my gf, and i can honestly say its actually pretty fun on normal mode for the first 2 bosses (queen bee and skeletron), but then everything just goes to shit once you start actually taking the game slightly seriously, where really redundant stupid things are required to do things that arent even necessary.

all in all, the game stops being fun once you start trying to beat the wall of flesh. now from what i gather hes not that hard to beat, it just takes a really long time depending on where you are and what you have.

basically i had to build like 10 houses before another guide spawned (because for some dumb reason i couldnt build next to any of my ORIGINAL houses next to my spawn point, im assuming corruption or whatever retarded mechanic it is), and EVEN THEN once i got him to spawn, i literally did not get a SINGLE voodoo demon to spawn.

so i resorted to just digging straight down from where the guide respawned, AAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLL THE WAY down to hell, just sacrifice the guide AGAIN, and to die to the wall of flesh AGAIN, because the geniuses who made this game decided not to tell you what you actually NEED to beat the fucking thing in the FIRST FUCKING PLACE.

its all just a giant waste of time, unless of course youre an absolute BRAINLET who just likes pressing buttons for the fuck of it.

do not waste your life. play smash ultimate.

EDIT: 6/2/2022

upon further play time and just a little bit more patience, ive come to realize that this game is an absolute masterpiece.

its all about the journey, NOT the destination. which is why ive decided to leave the original review in plain site.

ups, downs, and all arounds are to be expected with a challenge, but never in my wildest dreams did i expect to be challenged this much.

all just to realize all i needed to do was drink a couple potions, and just spam demon scythe and bees knees at the wall of flesh and he was dead in less than a minute. 

this is a game for everyone, its as simple as that.

if you dont like this game, youve got something wrong with your head.

I am very confused and they won't actually tell me why I can't play terraria. I would give this game at least 4 stars if it worked, but since it doesn't the max I'm willing to give it is 2 stars."

"
26399,great game love it
26400,"i mean, its alright"
26401,100% completed the game and I can safely say that its a very good game. Even better with friends but a solo run is also enjoyable. Does have some annoying aspects like the constant Bloodmoons and Solar Eclipses but those are only annoying when you are trying to skip days. Overall pretty good game and I fully recommend it. 9/10
26402,AAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHHHHHH
26403,epico
26404,"Very fun, Terraria has alot of content and is very optimized."
26405,Good game
26406,"Its very good,  ive played on about 6 platforms and enjoyed every play through, could not recommend enough."
26407,"It's a very fun and chiseled game(no pun intended) as well as involved and complex. ""Easy to pick up, hard to master."""
26408,"2D Minecraft is a good game. A little confusing when you dont know what to do, but thats ok!"
26409,",,,"
26410,Terraria
26411,Very fun if you have a nice liking for 2D RPG games.
26412,this is the best game ive ever played at a point i played 54.9 hours in 3 days
26413,"I have 37 hours on pc, but on mobile, console, and switch, I have well over 1000 hours. almost all achievements completed (only a few missing). And all I have to say is that this game is an original masterpiece, so far ahead of everything else. dozens of bosses, thousands of items, and creators that care about and listen to their community. Been my favourite game since I was 7 (Update 1.20). Honestly, I hope that Terraria otherworld gets published so that Terraria can live on. I'm so very sad to know that the next couple of updaste will be it. It's all over after that. I could almost cry, because Terraria played such a huge impact in my childhood and stuck with me through it all."
26414,Amazing
26415,"great game so much fun
"
26416,good game bruv
26417,Great game
26418,"Terraria is one of the best games that I've played in quite some time, and I'm glad that I cam across it too. The exploration, the battles, and creativity, if you want to make a little village of sorts, you can, if you want to become the worlds strongest champion, you can. I highly suggest this game to others!"
26419,"At first glance its just 2D Minecraft with cute sixteen bit graphics. But no no no no no its a very different game. I killed a guy and a skeleton head with 2 arms killed me 10/10 worth the money,"
26420,yes
26421,"I cannot recommend this game enough. It will forever be my most played game on steam, as I can always find the time to come back and complete another wonderful play though."
26422,ITS FUN
26423,"Before considering my low playtime: I have played this on mobile since 1.2. Absolutely love the game, honestly nothing I would ever change about it. Can't say a whole lot more than that, so yeah, it's more than worth your money!"
26424,Minecraft but 2D
26425,"Fun, but sometimes hard to learn! I enjoyed it!"
26426, i am goob
26427,"IT's good <3
"
26428,best 2d game ever ive played this for over 100 hours i love it
26429,its alright
26430,"fun for weeks
"
26431,it's a very fun game
26432,because i said so
26433,"This game is definitely one of my all time favourites!
However, the last fishing achievement will end with me committing arson."
26434,"[h1] Great game for those who want something different. [/h1]
It's a great game! If you like looting hidden chests and PvE to then relax building your home with the loot you've gathered, this is the game for you. 2D graphics and beautiful music, miriads of caves to explore and many different monsters to fight. You can build, you can fight, you can explore.
Progression is Boss fight based, but there are many fun ways to build your character. Just don't overestimate your chances, some bosses are very hard and frustrating without the right equipment. You may want to build a wonderful town but beware for slime rain!"
26435,Played this game non stop Since i got it love it
26436,"I've played this game for over 100hrs. I have struggled, climbed and died. I have been ditched by my friends for hours, lost in caves, dying to ghosts. to this day I have no idea which ore is better than another. I've been told, ""always asking questions... look at the wiki."" but that's not it. I choose the path I make, every hour brings joy. Not knowing if tugnson ore is better than gold. this is the way I roll. I love this game, and I will continue to be bad at it."
26437,this game is awesome for friends or playing alone.
26438,k√•nkelneger
26439,"Very good game, I have ran this masterpiece for a wlong long time now. I even think i am a part of the terraria world and wish i was. So good game."

26468,It's a good game. So much to get sucked into.
26469,yes
26470,good game
26471,I would recommend because this game's complexity is enticing and can keep you playing for a long time no matter how many times you die to those random traps in caves.
26472,Very good game

26480,99 hours and still can't defeat a hardmode boss (no joke it's a really good game)
26481,gender swap potion
26482,"This game is really really good to the point that after playing it for more than 10 hours straight, I would still want to play more. Even though there's a lot of grinding and farming, it's far different than other games that make you do this. No matter how long you grind for items, it never gets repetitive. There is a constant progress throughout the game; weapons that felt overpowered a few hours ago, become trivial and you feel the joy of getting new gear, every single time.

You need to build your own arenas for boss fights and events, houses for NPCs, farms for potions... you name it. And building it in the best way you can, always pays off. (Even if you're not a big fan of building in games)

A great game, I %100 recommend it."
26483,good game
26484,"Super fun with friends, even without friends there‚Äôs so many things to do and I love the building mechanics in this game. Would definitely recommend!"
26485,"Terraria is a game which I have never experienced before. Its amazing, with a lot of elements to explore, craft and use. My only problem with the game is that I wish it would give information about certain things to a new player, so that the game becomes more intuitive!"
26486,Easily one of my favourite games. Made for mouse and keyboard
26487,great fun for all the family
26488,absolute amazing game recommend to nearly anyone as there are so many ways to have fun at first there was a huge learning curve but i still really enjoyed this well worth the money
26489,yes buy it it is worth it it is very fun and WORMS GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRR
26490,chill second game to play when you rage quit other games
26491,"There is a reason as to why Terraria is one of the best selling games of all time. And as to why you most likely have a large amount of friends who own it on steam. 

Terraria is what happens, when every aspect of a game is flawless. The soundtrack is one of the best of any game ever. Period. However when I say that, I hope you get my full meaning when I say it does not carry this game. Simply because not a single aspect of this game requires carrying. It has, imo, the best progression system any single open world sandbox game has ever had, with the most satisfying gameplay mechanics, boss fights, and loops. 

Going further into the aspect of the gameplay progression, it feels perfect. You start the game weak whelp of a player. You can find a couple of weapons, and hold your own. But for the most part, you're at the whim of the world. As you dig and explore however, you will become stronger and stronger. Then you'll fight some bosses, and get better and better gear. Then right as you're feeling like the master of the world, you'll defeat the toughest boss yet, and it will open a new area, or completely transform the whole world as is, and you'll once again feel weak. But not just because suddenly you're fighting level matched enemies, but because now you're fighting whole new enemies, who can drop whole new loot, with stronger potential. Unlike Skyrim progression (for example) the difficulty scaling of enemies doesn't feel cheap, but earned and satisfying.

The bosses themselves are fantastic. Of course they get tougher just in matter of numbers, such as higher DPS, health, so on, but the complexity and skills required to defeat each subsequent boss gets progressively more intricate and satisfying to conquer. You could take the very first boss, and the very last, (or even any other), and even if they were to do the same numbers in terms of damage, and health, you would still be able to tell which one is supposed to be more difficult just because of the way the bosses fight.

Again not one aspect of this game is lacking. The sound design is so crisp and clean. It's soo satisfying to mine, especially as you get stronger and stronger, and the clean 'tick, tick, tick's of mining blocks get faster and faster.  The art is perfectly what it needs to be for what the game is going for. Simple, but also expressive. Each biome (with the help of all of the unique biome music) looks and feels unique. Each has its own personalities, if you will. The ice biome is unforgiving, with a focus on disrupting movement, whether that's chilling water, or slippery ice. The jungle is very spiky, and most deaths will come from being poisoned. The evil biomes are genuinely very eerie your first times diving into them.

This game is a must have. Singleplayer is a fantastic experience, and multiplayer can be some of the most fun you can have with friends online."
26492,Too many racist undertones.
26493,This game is great
26494,terraria day theme
26495,"this never used to be a problem, i still have the same monitor but after updating the game I have had terrible ghosting, besides this when I didnt have this problem...its an amazing and fun game and I absolutely love it, but please fix the ghosting...and yes my monitor is a 60HZ so dont go explaining to me that its because the terraria game is capped out at 60..ugh.. anyways this is the same monitor, same computer but now after the update theres ghosting!! please fix it!"
26496,"I'm late to the party but it's better than never. I can't believe it took me this long to get into Terraria and I am ever so grateful. It is a game with repeat value and randomly generated worlds that contain all sorts of excitement. Playing a large world in expert mode is rewarding with a friend. One of the best open-world, sandbox (2D Platformer) RPGs out there.

26506,"Incredible game. I can barely describe how masterfully perfected this game is. You can tell that the developers spent hours and hours of their time adding content to every little inch and corner of the game. Even after 34 hours of playing, it continues to amaze me. The thing about this game is that you are always progressing. No matter what. There is almost always something going on and something to do. Terraria adds excitement and new things to everything in the game. At no point in my experience of the game has it let me down. You are always finding, doing, or experiencing something new in the game. Every single time you play. Unless you have 100% seen everything there is to see. But thats what mods are for. (; In any case, this game is a solid 10/10. An absolute magnificent work of art, and the masterpiece of all masterpieces."
26507,Chill fun game to pass time. Lots to do and fun to play with other players :).
26508,I liked they game but the thing i dont like is that theres no crossover because my cousing plays in nintendo switch and i play on pc so are you guys going to make a crosover one day?

26534,"Simple fun or complex game play, many class options, overall worth"
26535,very good very nice pls download very worth
26536,Very fun game! you get to build and fight and explore. Basically 2D minecraft XD
26537,I got killed by a flower
26538,"Absolutely fantastic game to play solo or with friends. Going from nothing to a God in Master mode was fun and grindy.

In terms of game play, once you get used to and appreciate the games interesting mechanics and graphics, the world is breathtaking. With thousands of different accessory and weapon combinations that can be used to make your character ridiculously strong. Whether you reduce all damage taken by 75% using Beetle armour and a Worm Scarf, or get a critical hit chance of over 100%, the game is incredibly fun. 

From the perspective of a completionist, this game is in no way too hard or annoying, with a slight exception. Two words. Fishing. Quests. They absolutely sucked. Good luck everyone.

Overall, an amazing game, which I highly recommend you play with Friends."
26539,Its just a fun chill game for the most part

26546,"Terraria is often called a labour of love, and that is absolutely right. Whether you play by yourself or with friends, Terraria is a truly special game and a phenomenal experience that has been updated with new content consistently for 11 years. With over 600 hours played across both vanilla and modded Terraria, I could not recommend it strongly enough if I tried."
26547,"Great art style, good music, and over all good vibe. With the help of a friend I got it figured out in no time. I am loving it and I have not even played much yet."
26548,rust is better but this game is ok
26549,More love from the devs than most games. High quality updates over the course of it's life have made this game into one of my all time favorites and always come back to playing it at some point. Hundreds of hours and immensely replayable.

26641,"it's been really fun exploring and seeing how the world works. it's been a very long time since i played a side scrolling game. Co-op has been super fun as well. 
make sure to save your monies - there's some pricey big ticket items that randomly appear - that will be necessary. and like all true games with glam options - it truly is the ""end game"" lol. ‚ô•

overall, i would definitely recommend this game."

26644,"What can I really say that hasn't already been said. Terraria is the greatest 2D sandbox I've played to date. Building your way through a crafting game has never felt so right.

26668,balls of cthulu update when
26669,Its just very fun no matter how many times you play it
26670,"terraria is just a generally amazing game, you can do alot of stuff in it and it is just fun"
26671,"Absolute banger. Just play it.

Thought it was just a rubbish 2D minecraft before I tried it. This game goes into so much depth, the premise is not just building and exploring, its got combat, bosses, and general development outside of just materials. The music is great, the art style is refreshing, the amount of customisability of blocks and building is insane, if you did just want to build, you can do it here. BEST FEATURE = FISHING. the fishing in this game is absolutely immaculate in design, rewarding, not a drag, can be used to aid progress in other areas like mining, bosses, tools & equipment or just building cool stuff."
26672,"its a good game

26678,I dont like this game
26679,"This game has lots of bosses, challenges, and enemies. You can also chose from journey mode to classic, expert, and master mode. If you get board of the game you can make your own challenges to. There is also a ton of  NPC's that you have get by having a requirement and building a home with table and chair, you also spawn with a guide NPC as well. He tells you what you should do next and how to craft things. This game has four different classes melee the tank and most strong, ranger the bow and gun user, mage the magic user, and summoner the class that sits back and lets their summons do every battle for them, also low defence. SO YOU CAN BUY IT TODAY!!!!!!! (also multiplayer)"

26687,Its pretty fun game with friends or only solo
26688,beans
26689,i like this game so much its addicting i hope they will have another update
26690,I love this game so much just because of how well made it is even though people consider it to be a clone of Minecraft this game is so much more than that. The variety that this game has is crazy and with mods this game gets even more awesome and mods aren't a hassle to get to because of the ease of use the free mod loader is only needing the base game. This is one of the best purchases I have made and would recommend others to play it
26691,is a realy good game and the bosses are fun
26692,"I really like this game cuz it has such a big variety of game styles and classes. And everytime you play feels like a new game, at least for me.  Pls ReLogic we need an update :)"
26693,"Terraria is probably one of, if not, the greatest game I have ever played. The worlds are beautiful, the fights feel amazing, the music is perfect, and the npc's have character to them.

26709,"Terraria can be a pretty hard game if you don't know what you're doing. It took me a while to figure out the simple mechanics. Once you're familiar with the game, it can get really exciting. There are epic boss battles and hundreds of tools to collect! What idiot said this is Minecraft?"
26710,lots of fun
26711,"CLASSIC terraria is always fun, i always find my slef re-visiting this game each year.

26720,accumulated a total of 1.1K hours recorded on steam and countless on PS4 - PS3 - OldGen Terraria mobile. what i really enjoy abut this game is that you have many ways and different methods that you could use in order to defeat 1 boss and the since of progression in the game is real. if you are like me and got burned out after playing 1k hours you can just jump into the modded community which is just an extension you can download after purchasing the game.

26770,idk man cool game i guess?
26771,You can summon slaves to fight for you and use a whip to make them better 10/10
26772,don't come into this game expecting 2d minecraft. this is a game about transforming yourself into a ruthless killing machine able to cut down eldritch monstrosities with the ease you cut down grass. I  have never felt more powerful than I did in this game.
26773,Good game
26774,this game is the peakest of peak
26775,good. very very painful and grindy but its so fun
26776,hentai demon try kill you
26777,"This game brings back so many memories, my favorite game ever and i will aways return to it"
26778,"minecraft 2d but more exploration, crafting and generally adventuring based
the devs are still putting love into this game even though they've said it was the 'last update' like 10 times now
also comes with mod support under the tModLoader platform, which comes with Terraria for free

good game"
26779,good game

26802,its very fun and i enjoy it
26803,Very fun would recommend it to new pc gamers as a starter game. HAVE FUN!!!!!
26804,"I absolutely recommend this game to everyone! I've played it for years on Xbox, but recently bought a gaming PC, and I remembered it. It's an AMAZING game, that gives you a sense of accomplishment whenever you overcome a challenge when progressing. Think of a 2D Minecraft, but better in EVERY WAY. It has hundreds of weapons and gear, a extremely large range of enemies of all shapes, sizes, and fighting styles. And completely original music for just about everything, from biome themes, to event music, to unique soundtracks for the majority of the bosses. You can truly play the game anyway you want, at whatever pace you want.

TLDR: I cannot recommend any other game more than this, YOU WILL ENJOY IT."
26805,Yes
26806,imagine fortnite but 36x better
26807,good game
26808,fun game to play with friends

26810,you can fish
26811,"Eh, it's okay I guess"
26812,"An extremely fun game that I know will continue to eat up time from me, building is fun and not too hard and the amount of creativity you can express is amazing! I'm not a huge fan of the combat but I know there are tons of people who will love it since there's plenty of variety. There's also alot of choices when it comes to your appearance which i'm a fan of too! I Feel the game really shines when it comes to multiplayer but the singleplayer experience is fun too"
26813,"I've played this since 1.2 on various platforms, I would recommend this to anyone! Many years of great fun was spent on this game with friends in school and all the way to this day :)"

26860,"I've played this game more than any other game on Steam. Nothing really compares to it. You can spend hours and hours exploring just a small fragment of the world, uncovering new biomes, loot chests, creatures, and resources. Fill your inventory with treasures and regroup at base. Craft and trade gear with your friends for strategic boss battles, progressing in difficulty as the game goes on. It can be as easy or as challenging as you like.  Spend hundreds of hours designing and redesigning your bases throughout the world. Meet, save, and add NPCs to your towns, each with unique benefits. I can't say much about this game that hasn't already been said but if you don't already own it, you should just buy it right now. You'll quickly understand why it has such a dedicated fanbase."

26901,very gud
26902,CXGXCGXZCGX
26903,Minecraft but with more content.
26904,pretty bussin sheeesh
26905,Basically Minecraft but better.
26906,Get it or you shall fall apart and all of your atoms will disassemble into seperate loose pieces spread out all over the floor. You need to get it this year. It's your only escape.
26907,"sure
"
26908,Good Game
26909,VERY FUN PLZ BUY
26910,"great game would reccomend, when you buy it, steam allows you to buy tmods (for free) which is the mod launcher for the game!
"
26911,"gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
"
26912,Not 2D Minecraft. Much more.
26913,Minecraft
26914,"possibly the best game I have ever played
"
26915,"Really good and deep game with lots of content, controls are kind hard to master but not impossible. That being said this probably has the worst crafting mechanic i have ever seen in a game, doesn't make the game bad but its an absolute pain without a guide."
26916,gud
26917,May god among us bless this game this holy scripture sent be garfield our god and lord and savior the shower to us of tirana may god bless him garfield and this terrarium amen
26918,This is a god tier game absolutely love it!
26919,Very fun game but i do suggest looking up tips and tricks if you're new !! Some things were not explained and took me a bit to figure out
26920,so amazing best game i have ever played 100% reccomend if you have brain cells.
26921,"I originally started playing Terraria in 2016 on the Wii U. When that was  discontinued, I eventually decided to get the PC version. This is still a great game to this day. The classic soundtrack still gives my nostalgia."
26922,"Fun game all around. There isn't much to say in terms of negatives, besides the pillars lmao. Several ways to play, many different items, many different challenge seeds and difficulties. Also, the modding community for this game is insane. Definitely worth playing."
26923,I love kidnapping animals and selling them to the Zookeeper for free money
26924,this game is good
26925,Very nice and smooth gameplay
26926,Pile of shite.
26927,good game
26928,"This game is honestly amazing! I haven't played a game this fun for ages. Some of my friend said ""fake minecraft"" ""minecraft is WAAAAAAAAAAAAY better"" or ""That's a 1960's bloody old game"" (when minecraft is 2 years older ;) ) but it was amazing. Ofcourse my friend never played it and is a prejudice person but it was amazing. People say it's similar to minecraft (it is kind of) but theres something thats 100% different to minecraft that makes the game way better. Terraria is 99% adventure based and has less of those servers and stuff. There is no end and is just a never ending adventure. Once you get bored of having a completely grinded world, It is time to create a new one. The cool part about this game is that you can create as many players or worlds as you want. The world is completely different and allows you to create a new journey. Also, when you create a new world, The player you used will save!! All the items that was in your inventory will stay there! Overall, Terraria is a complete game of just AMAZING. Some people says 2D games are bad and stuff but that is wrong. This game illustrates the best way a 2D game can. You can make realistic houses in 2D. THIS GAME IS JUST AWESOME WORTH PAYING 15$ GET IT RIGHT NOW."

26943,Better than minecraft because it has more things to do
26944,e
26945,"Everything is good, but a suggestion is that Re-logic should delete summoners from the game for good. I think this will make progression feel more rewarding and make the game balanced."

26965,its fun
26966,"Terraria Is An Action-Adventure, RPG, Sandbox Masterpiece And Here Is Why...

Terraria not only is one of the best games ever (In my opinion), But it is also one of the most diverse sandbox games I have ever played. For instance, there is a whole class system with totally unique weapons, tools, armor sets and buffs directed to that specific class. There are tons of bosses that are both challenging but fun to fight against. And yes the amount of grinding in this game can be overwhelming at times but it is worth every minute if it means you get to progress further and further to achieve your goal. whether it be trying to collect every set of wings or armor sets in the game for your collection to show off to your friends or building a massive town or mega-mansion to house all of the things you've gathered over time. Or maybe you want to purge the world evil that plagues every corner of your world in an attempt to save it from being corrupted. And if I get started on the community and the support the developers show to them I would probably have to write about another 3 reviews so all i'm going to say is that Re-Logic is amazing for supporting the community, specifically the modding community contrary to some other indie developers. So to put this is short, Terraria is one of the most creatively diverse Action-Adventure, RPG, Sandbox games that i have ever played and i thank Re-Logic for making a game that truly lets me be creative even if its on a 2D space."
26967,It is art.
26968,"Timeless, great both solo or with friends"
26969,Very Good game
26970,"game with loooooong play throughs have fun, rage and die when u grind for years to get one item COUGH COUGH Rod of Discord COUGH COUGH"
26971, IS FUN
26972,its fun
26973,yes
26974,too fun
26975,yes
26976,Best sandbox game on the market!
26977,"I have played this game for a long time and overall I want to say that its very enjoyable. BUT I have a lot of issues with grinding especially when it comes to planterra bulbs. Another issue I have is that i cant run it on my AlphaSmart Neo2 laptop. I would not recommend this game as it takes a lot of time to even progress especially if you want to make your world look nice. And one more problem I have is that there is very little to help you figure out what you need to do in terraria so you always need the wiki open.












Jk you thought this game is epic."
26978,very epic
26979,"Yucky Game... will i play, again, yeah.. will i enjoy it, maybe."
26980,Amazing
26981,gud gaem

"
26985,its alright
26986,play calamity mod
26987,Not for me.
26988,"Help...
My Friend has tortured me to recommend this"
26989,"i have to do all of the pillars again because i got blocked by a sky island and i died

>:("
26990,"This is the type of game that you feel compelled to keep playing, but when all's said and done, you look back and realize the game hasn't given you anything worthwhile. Did this game enrich my life in any meaningful way? No, not really. Did I particularly enjoy my time playing? No, certainly not enough to justify even a fraction of the hours I put in. It's just a boring grind most of the time, designed to keep you addicted without doing much of anything else.

The only compelling reason I can imagine to play this game is if your friends are playing in a multiplayer world, but even then, there are much better co-op games out there. Take my meaninglessly, needlessly wasted time as a warning, and don't play this game. Spend your time on something more meaningful. Another, better game perhaps, or a creative hobby you truly care about."
26991,good game
26992,its alright i guess
26993,10/10
26994,cool game is cool yes
26995,"I have been playing Terraria for the better part of 7 years, mostly on Xbox platforms, but then after 1.4 came out I decided to buy it on my computer to play with my friends and it is probably one of the greatest experiences I have ever had with the game."

26999,gud
27000,amazing
27001,"Since hearing about a possible Terraria 2,i wanted to revisit this game.A lot has changed,but i still had fun.And i really recommend playing this game."
27002,So fun to play solo and with friends and there is great replay ability cause of the classes. Everything about this game is absolutely amazing.
27003,"This game is awesome for players who like casual and challenging games.
personally I like it, you should to, because it's a good game from my perspective. and yours soon enough.
Yeah... buy the game or you'll regret it."
27004,"I have played this game on and off for years ever since it came out, and I cannot think of a game more deserving of my praise. The game was already fun back in 2011, but they just kept making more and more game and I love going back and seeing what I might've missed, playing a different way, building new weird structures, and just messing around by myself and with friends.

Exploration, mining, fun combat, lots of great challenges... it's worth every hour I've put into it, and every penny paid. I highly recommend this game."
27005,the replay ability keeps the game fresh
27006,This game is very fun (mostly with friends). It is also very hard. (please dont call this minecraft 2d or something like that)

27055,"Fun, challenging, but a bit of a grind. Once you've got the hang of it, its pretty simple: hop from boss-fighting to collecting to just relaxing."
27056,Terraria is a game I've played for nearly a decade now across multiple different platforms and it is both one my most played and favorite games of all time. I would definitely recommend any and everyone to play through it at least once.
27057,fun

27077,"Ok. If you have not bought this game, and you have steam, you probably should. Most of the reason I love it is the bosses, but it has easy to access and huge building potential, amazing exploration, a reason to go back to biomes you have explored, really fun items, and obviously, great combat. The bosses are some of the most complex mechanically I have ever seen, and are very unique and fun, and yet fighting them is always simple. It's just attack the boss, dodge the attacks. If you have beaten this game and want more, go play Tmodloader. It is currently on 1.3, but will be updating to 1.4 in the near(?) future. So yeah, play terraria. 10/10, best $10 I've ever spent."

27167,"Wow. I am truly amazed. And listen up- I DO NOT CARE if this game was 30 bucks, it was worth it! This game has such a variety of feelings it can give you- Calm when fishing... Active when fighting... And exited while exploring! People say that Terraria is a copy of Minecraft, but please, don't listen to them! Minecraft actually released AFTER Terraria. No one copied anyone, both games are very different."

27193,Wonderul
27194,ye cool beans
27195,really fun and even runs really well on my none gaming laptop its worth the 10$ i have been playing this for years on my Xbox and i have been playing this all the time so 10 $ for thousands of hours of fun i think is worth it but its not for everyone so maybe watch some stuff about it before getting.
27196,great game to play has challenges and creativity
27197,oi nah fr this game was on god no cap deadass the best game ive played in a little while. would defo reccomend to all my fellow eetswa's out there. stay wicked!!!!
27198,"Countless hours of fun gameplay that doesn't get repetitive. All of the reviews basically explain the game so I won't write anything about it. This game is a genius in all categories. Definitely recommend it.

I recieved the game for free from a friend with intentions of buying it myself, I thank them.
Since then I've bought the game for about 3 people now. I think that should explain everything."

27252,Awesome game!
27253,"I wish I played this earlier. It can be really confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's EXTREMELY entertaining. There's A TON of content and ways to be creative. People compare it to Minecraft, but it really is it's own beast.

The one and ONLY con I've encountered was that, if you let too many drops stay on the ground without picking them up, at least while playing with a friend in a server, it lags the game HARD. I'm assuming most of this is due to the massive amounts of coins that get littered about. This makes doing wave-type defense impossible unless you make sure to actively pick up the drops every minute or so."
27254,"Its a great game took me some time to learn how to jump some of those tutorials aren't nearly long enough to explain such an intricate and complicated mechanic, If hadn't escaped from the mental hospital they would probably keep feeding me lies about ""those voices arent real"" when i can hear them all the time it's so strange they would try to get rid of my friends."

27325,"Fishing simulator disguised as an rpg. Best in slot weapons? Optimal DPS? Mobility vs Defense vs Offense? Nonsense. You should pay more attention to the time of day: dawn and dusk are the optimal fishing times, though with enough fishing power you can bruteforce any time of day. Fish are more active during full moons and blood moons, though during the latter you will encounter some special enemies (they drop chum which you can use to fish better). Don't forget to take into account the weather: the wetter the better. And you musn't forget about your hidden luck stat, which has a chance to influence your fishing power; to increase your luck, make sure to only place the correct type of torches in their respective biomes (CONSULT WIKI), and place gnomes (that's right). Did you know ladybugs are lucky? Even touching one will temporarily increase your luck; If you kill one or use one as bait however, you will suffer a luck penalty. Grab any ladybugs you find as they can be used for luck potions. Of course you should be using your fishing potions at all times to further increase fishing power. Sonar potions can help you avoid trash fish which will conserve your precious masterbait (or buggys/enchanted nightcrawlers if you don't have any). The pond you're fishing in is TOO SMALL! You're losing 40% of your hard-earned fishing power! Do you seriously not have anything better than a fisher of souls yet!? Sounds like you haven't been keeping up on your daily angler quests. Did you know angler earring's fishing power stacks with tackle bag and lava tackle bag? Send help please."

27355,"The best game for me so far!

If you would like to just relax, you could build a house or manage your NPC's placement.

If you are ready for some action, there are plenty of bosses and sneaky enemies.

The game has a great sort of a story line and direct objectives, but the most fun part is, when you have accomplished everything, you can take your character to a brand new world and start all over again!

Also, it's a good way to connect with friends. Especially in a nasty boss fight.

I've followed this game since the early stages. It was good back then, and I must say it improved a lot until today. 

Bravo, Re-Logic! Everything is working smoothly!"

27363,"Finding yourself needing to kill a couple hundred hours, well this is the game for you! It's fun. You kill, you build, you die...and repeat. Great on console too just missing a few small QOL stuff that hasn't made it over you and the controls for shooting can be a little sluggish. Overall i recommend!! And also don't lookup guides before you play. I went in blind the first time and died so many times the first night I though the game sucked, stick with it through the first night. You got this!"

27480,
27481,"A perfect game for both trying to relax and trying to work towards a larger goal, such as taking down the bosses."
27482,Fun
27483,"I'm hooked. I LOVE THIS GAME! The bosses, the progression, the fact that you need to make your npcs happy. I LOVE IT! Would recommend to anyone who loves survival type games!"
27484,"This is a very addictive game. There are many ways to play the game and there is something for everyone. It has bosses and tons of weapons for the action oriented player, as well as sandbox style building. Swords, Guns, Bows, Summons, Yo-yos, etc give the game a fresh feeling every new play-style you try.

So many quality of life updates have been made to smooth the game experience (this is even before the final update has come out). Most sandbox games like this you are pretty slow until later game but this game you not only increase your mobility very early in the game but also you can gain teleportation to get to specific parts of the game area faster. 

Highly recommend to play this game especially with friends. Don't cheat and have them give you end game items though. It will make you feel like the rest of the game you are underpowered even though most the game it is hard not to be overpowered."
27485,"Like the best game on steam, period."

This song goes out to all the spinners out there
Just keep spinnin'
I love FIDGET SPINNERS
From my head to my toes
I even love one spinning
Right here on my nose
Got one on my left
Anotha on my right
I'll be out here spinning
From the morning to the night
Hold up for a minute
And just watch me as I spin it
If you want a smoothie
Then just holla and I'll blend it
Pay some greens
Collard beans
Butter, Lettuce, Spinach
Cop bout a hundred of the FIDGETS
That keep spinnin'
Custom FIDGET SPINNERS
So you know that no one's got em'
I toss one in the air
And just catch it from the bottom
Got these FIDGET SPINNERS
And they spinnin' all around
If I pick one up
Then you know it's going down
I love FIDGET SPINNERS
From my head to my toes
I even love one spinning
Right here on my nose
Got one on my left
Anotha on my right
I'll be out here spinning
From the morning to the night
I love the way that it spins around
Like a hula hoop in a helicopter
A ferris wheel goes round and round
But my fidget spinner does it faster
I'm spinning making cotton candy
Here in planet Earth
Both of them still spinning
But the FIDGET'S where it's worth
Don't turn around
Don't look back
The only thing that should be spinning
Is this lil'toy that keeps trending
It's my biggest fan
It's spinning man
And I hope you know it's not ending
This right here is just beginning
I love FIDGET SPINNERS
From my head to my toes
I even love one spinning
Right here on my nose
Got one on my left
Anotha on my right
I'll be out here spinning
From the morning to the night
I LOVE FIDGET SPINNERS

27504,"Amazing, only played for about 9 hours and LOVE IT"
27505,"At first I was a little put off by this title, I won't lie.  I played about a half hour, uninstalled it and put it on the back burner.  I recently decided to give the game an honest shot, and must say I'm hooked.  I was a fan of Starbound already, so the building mechanics are pretty familiar, but this game feels so much more like it was built by a team with a clear vision, rather than one that was slapped together with unfitting pieces by shady developers. (yeah that was a shot fired at Chucklefish)  The controls seem a little lackluster at first, but once you start to get better than starting gear it actually gets to a point where you can terraform your bases as you see fit, and you feel invincible against enemies.  Mid-game the game kicks it up a notch and makes you feel as helpless as the beginning of the game, and doesn't do so cheaply.  There are hundreds of craftable items and weapons, and bosses to fight that are both terrifying and whimsical.  All in all I give this game a hearty thumbs-up, I wish I had given it more of a chance a few years ago but am pleased that it was still in my library.

TLDR: Great game crafted with obvious love.  Hearty thumbs-up."

27517,I always thought 2D Games in this day in age were terrible and for a small audience. That is until my Friend bought and played Terraria with me. Never did I think this game and others in its genre be as good as t hey are. Terraria is a 1000x better then most games released by big companies today. I love this game and it taught me to be more open minded about 2D Games in general.

27589,"Terraria ... A chic game of its time and now. She can easily drag out a couple of three adventures. This is because terraria has everything from uncharted lands and building your own house to crafting various weapons and killing various monsters and bosses. A beautiful 2D world, a very pleasant musical accompaniment, a chic background - all this wonderfully complements the overall picture. If you have not played terraria yet, then take your friend with you and go in search of adventure, because together it is even more fun and not so scary to fight hordes of monsters.
And if you are already familiar with the game, but are afraid to play it, consider it difficult because of the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãcontent, then I assure you there is nothing complicated about it. You only need to start playing and gradually you will develop in this chic world. I recommend to everyone."

Also I watch subway videos and I be getting hungry for a slice of pizza so I used taco shells and ketchup with american cheese and I will not lie that home made pizza I made was so good I made some for my mom and she cried and threw it at me so I got angry and whooped her and stole her purse and sold it to buy myself a copy of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and I watched it with my pet fly that be sleeping in my hair sometimes and I found out it's pregnant and there is little baby eggs all over my hair and it's so cute and I haven't showered in idk maybe like 6 months and I also help feed the family by putting french fries on my hair and sometimes a little bit of sweet and sour sauce as a little treat for them."
27593,"This game is possibly the best game on steam 
"
27594,The most replayable and enjoyable survival game that grows an addiction.
27595,"Alright, TLDR: if you are a fan of any of the genres this game is listed as, this is a must have.

I have been playing this game since it released for the first time 11 years ago and this is by far one of the greatest games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. From the developers who listened to the fans and clearly put so much hard work and passion into this game, to the wonderful community that surrounds it, every second that I've spent experiencing this game grow into what it is today has been an amazing journey.

The overall mechanics are simple enough that an inexperienced player can easily pick them up. The crafting is straight forward, the combat feels smooth and satisfying, exploring is rewarding, and there's enough variety with different building materials that you can truly get as creative as you want. 

Though without a doubt, one of my favorite parts of this game is the progression. Beating a milestone boss feels satisfying, and the rewards for doing so always feel worth it. Usually when I complete a game 100% the achievements are such a hassle, but I truly had a blast the entire time I was completing this game.

And this is all just the base game, the modding community is thriving. With the addition of workshop content and TModloader being put on steam, any player can download it and have a fantastic time making their very own custom content, download additional content to the game, or even just break the game to their hearts content without any risk that a third-party site may have.

Overall, for just $10 there is no reason to not purchase and try out this game. While it may be slow at the start, I promise you that it will quickly grab your attention, or at the very least be a fun distraction for a while."

27608,You dig and dig and dig and then sometimes you dig a little more and then die.
27609,"Defeated the moon lord, had beaten the game, got the Zenith, Defeated all the enemies. I can now live in peace, The Princess and I settled in a simple tree house. I can rest now, it was fun.

Terraria is a W game.

27629,9/10 Great game. I didn't get so far but it's still enjoyable.

27639,"expert mode is heII and cancer and not fun. its abysmal when you have 7 enemies surrounding you in a confined area that all kill you in 4 hits so you get to play the game for a total of 2 seconds maximum before you get assaulted from every angle while trying to farm or grind for some item that has less chance of showing up than winning the lottery. i despise this game with a passion. the game itself is good but everytime someone wants to play expert mode bc its ""not that hard"" i wish i was stuck in a 39 year coma so i never have to experience the dread, anger, depression, and pain that is suffering through the heII known as expert mode terraria"
27640,The best game on the steam.

27650,its fun :)
27651,"Very Fun, should get"
27652,"People say that Terraria is 2D Minecraft, but it's not true it's even better. There are so many ways to level up if you get stuck on a boss. The bosses are so interesting a flying eye, skeleton, and a wall if flesh. The grind is fair it never feel like you need to spend hours for new armors and wapons. 

TL-DR: Terraria > Minecraft."
27653,"actually a great game
a bit dificult in the begginning if you dont know what to do"
27654,"One of my all time favourites, this game never gets boring doesnt matter how long you play theres always something to do. The dedication from the developers is crazy, after 11 years they are still producing updates."
27655,balls haha funny
27656,gud

27685,"First of all, this game is a masterpiece, I remember playing this game in 2017 on console and I became extremely attached to this game, I played Minecraft longer than Terraria which is the inspiration of this game. Terraria in my opinion is better than Minecraft. Number one favorite game, 10/10, would highly recommend."
27686,hard at the start and the midgame its meh and after moonlord you have zenith yeah and its the easiest thing ever buy it i recommend
27687,100% recommend this game
27688,6/6
27689,"one of the greatest games of all time, no contest"
27690,Its very fun.
27691,"Just fun overall. Journey mode is great for people who want to build to their hearts content, or learn the game and boss fights for classic, expert, or master. Classic is good for the original, everyday terraria experience. Expert is definitely a fun challenge, and evasion is something you‚Äôve gotta know. Master is a pure challenge, for the greatest of the greatest. Dodging is a must, since most bosses and enemies can kill you in a few hits."
27692,"It's amazing and fun, very simple, the team did amazing work"
27693,Nice
27694,This is a good survival and adveture game but it is a bit like minecraft but with more things in it so i recommend to buy it.

27749,"for a very great price, this experience was the best for me, the overall game aesthetic, the boss fights, and the range of items, blocks, and weapons to use, I greatly recommend this game to other people who just wanna have a chill time building, boss rushing, creating circuitry, and even playing with friends, with such a cool community and the best dev team, they will not make you bored playing this"
27750,i love terraria but my friend keep thirsting over the party girl and the nurse while im working my ass
27751,its ok i guess
27752,Its a great game for people who like Minecraft.
27753,"game  :)
"
27754,"Terraria is my favorite game. Whether that opinion is formed by nostalgia or objectiveness I can't be certain, but it is one of the few games that I can always go back to. The balance of boss progression and creation is unmatched by any other game I've played, and the memories I've made from the hundreds of hours I've spent in worlds across platforms are some of my fondest. My only complaint is that if you're not creatively inclined like myself, once you defeat the final boss and craft your end game gear, that's the end. This problem however can easily be solved with mods. The love the community and the developers have for this game is truly incredible, and it makes you want to keep coming back. If you've still somehow never played, or had a bad experience and are considering whether to buy or not, I strongly suggest that you give it a try. The start can be slow if you're new, but there's a wiki there to help, and with a couple of friends you're bound to have a good time.

(thank you terraria devs, i love you all)"
27755,)
27756,yea it ok i guess i mean it doesnt really touch up on todaes topics like race and gender nuetertality ykno but like yea its pretty good ig i mean its kinda ok but idd defo get it because its realy nic e to pl a with your friends like minecraft but more akin to contra or Metal Slug: 2 Gears of War my favorite game other than this one fo course: titan fall 2 damn good game higly recomend it to my cousin he loves minecraft world we got were we have diamonds and cars and an infinite gta 4 moneyi glitch thanks : )

27826,"This is one of the greatest gaming experiences of all time. There's endless possibilities and it feels like a great adventure. As with most games, the experience is greatly hightened by multiplayer and I reccomend playing with friends."
27827,"In my opinion, this game is very fun until you beat the game once, since then everything is just repetitive even if you do choose to play on a new world in a different difficulty. This is due to still needing to defeat the same bosses, albeit more difficult, and I do like the exclusive items for harder difficulties however I feel like the game would be better if it was longer, and there was more bosses after moon lord."
27828,"Absolutely amazing game, the devs are still updating it, and there's loads of stuff to do. I have over 300 hours and i'm still finding out new things.

PROS:
-Combat is very exiting and engaging most of the time.
-Immense replay-ability potential because of the class system, and thousands of weapons and items.
-Adventure is great.

CONS:
-Not enough summoner content IMO.
-That's it.

It's not just a sandbox RPG, it's the perfect balance between ""sandbox"" and ""RPG."""

Terraria is just... well. I dunno. I have no words for this absolute masterpiece that the Devs kept pouring love into even after the ""final update"". Hell they even added modding support. It's their 11 year old love child that's been spreading its wings and soaring since it's birth in 2011. 

Anyway. See this game for yourself. I regret not playing this more thanks to my bloody hyper-fixations but I'm looking forward to spreading my flame wings and speeding through the skies again."

27911,"People call this 2.D Minecraft. However, this game is way more interesting and enjoyable then Minecraft. Minecraft has 2 bosses, Terraria has like 32, Minecraft's only ''Human'' N.P.C's are Monk Squidwards, Terraria has fun and whimsical N.P.C's that have their own personality. Probably one of the best games I've ever played."
27912,"Pretty fun with friends, gets kinda boring if you go solo imo. Terraria > Minecraft"
27913,One of the most re-playable games of all time. Find some friends and hop on to this as it's an unbelievable adventure. It is the best $10 you could spend and the amount of limitless worlds you can play is just insane.

27919,"I'd call this the best game, rivaled only by Minecraft. The difference between Terraria and Minecraft is that some people don't like Minecraft. like almost all games, playing with a friend or two makes the game infinitely better, but even playing solo is enjoyable. Terraria will tear your friend group apart and make it 5 times stronger at the same time. Sharing items is dangerous but hoarding items is more dangerous. The music is amazing, the backgrounds are perfect. The most fun ive ever had playing a game. Highly Recommended."

Relogic themselves are an absolutely fantastic team and they are too good to their community. They deserve all the good things that happen to them. Whether solo or with friends, this game is a blast and I highly recommend it to everyone."
27993,"There's a reason Terraria won work of love award (more than once?). For dirt cheap you get an amazing game with outstanding replayability, great intuitive controls, plenty of build variety for all the classic playstyles or hibrids. Explore the world, fight bosses in a nice vibrant 2d pixel world that you can build upon or destroy. Ever tried flooding Hell by digging a hole from the ocean?
All that + you get constant free updates (game is still being updated as of May 2022) and a multiplayer to play with your friends! (if any)"

28029,Pretty funny number <3
28030,"Terraria has been a part of my life since I was 12 years old, back then I had to partition my macbook's disk to run windows on it just so I could play it. I am now 23 and it remains one of my favourite games of all time. Every time I play through it, it's just as fun as the first time. It's that beautiful kind of game where you can take half a year off and start fresh, having just as much fun as you did the last time.

The game progression is wonderfully crafted to scale with your character, and the bosses give the perfect amount of challenge to keep you pressing on and upgrading your loadout.

11/10 for Terraria, thank you for always being there for me :)"
28031,"Pretty good game, with friends you can have a great time"
28032,played it for a little bit seems cool
28033,"well, just try it and get addicted"
28034,quite a pogger game
28035,this game is very fun there is so much you can do it is sorta like 2d minecraft
28036,Its Terraria you already know its a great game
28037,"big fun
10/10"
28038,yes
28039,"This is one of the most satisfying Gaming experiences that I have ever encountered. It adds value and depth to game play which is not easily rivalled and quite frankly superbly unique in an ever saturated market. I started playing the Game on my Mobile device in 2013 and have gone to the PC version and I can not get enough of it. Although I'm a casual player not spending nearly as much time in game as Chippy gaming or Khaios (I recommend any new player to go check these 2 out to learn allot) I still can say time well spent. One of the most unforgettable gaming experiences of my life. Relogic if this is your quality for all the work you do, expect a cult following and fans that will support you to the ends of the earth. Please keep up the great work!"
28040,Terraria
28041,"step 1: complete entire game (melee class recommended)
step 2: craft zendussy
step 3: go crazy
step 4: go stupid
step 5: 192.542.131.92"
28042,"
I am a 54 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
28043,"Great game, classic"
28044,best ever

28074,"Happy 11th birthday, Terraria. I bought this game about a year ago on its tenth anniversary, after seeing so many positive reviews and friends playing it. A year later, I've already invested 900+ hours into this game, still learning new things in my playthroughs. A huge chunk of my free time is spent into this game, which I don't regret. I would play it for countless years to come. Thank you, Re-logic."

You can put 100 hours into the game and there could still be a ton of things you don't know about,  I have been able to sink almost 700 hours on this account and I'm still not bored of it. It's fun on your own, and extremely fun with friends."

28134,"One of few games I come back to every year. There is good progression, awsome weapons and bosses. Nothing to hate, also try mods."
28135,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
28136,"It's going. It's going. And it's gone. Whatever. Maybe we should take a break. That's it. I can't take this anymore. I can't. I give up. I'm sick of struggling for survival. Competing with gophers and
earthworms and that loser sparrow... ...who always takes my nuts. And I'm especially sick of this stupid... ...stupid tree. -What's happening?
-Guys. I think he made it angry. I'm awake. I'm up... ...and I'm late. Demo. Dave Seville. Keys. Bag. Pants. I need pants. Pants are essential. Claire. -Dave.
-Hey. How's it going? I haven't seen you since.... Well, since you said you never wanted
to see me again. So I guess it worked. What a fun day that was. Let me guess.
You're late for something again. -Same old Dave.
-Not following you. You know,
the guy who's always fooling around... ...who can't handle
a serious relationship. That was the old Dave. How about we get together,
talk about the new Dave? Tomorrow night. My place. -I....
-Great. -No--
-You look good, Claire. Where are we? Well, I think they remodeled our forest.
I like it. Stylish, yet functional. Where did the mountains go? Give me a break.
We're in a building, Theodore. Dave. -Ian.
-Hey, big guy. Hey, you ever seen the view
from the 80th floor? -No. They never let me past the lobby.
-What? I can't.... Hey, back off, man,
this is Dave Seville. Mr. Seville, can I offer you
some muffins, scones, pastries? No. I'd hate to be a bother. It's no problem.
We have an omelet station. Omelet station. Can I get you some water
or a soy latte? How about a shot
of wheatgrass juice? Maybe later. Thanks. let's talk about your song, Dave. Well, as crazy as it sounds... -...the original inspiration came to me--
-The song sucks, Dave. -What?
-Your song? It's awful. I hate it. You know, I mean, who's gonna sing it?
Justin, Fergie? Not a chance. I need something new.
I need something fresh. -That is new.
-The next big thing. Dave, we go way back, all right? And we've both come a long way
since college. You? Not so much. I wanted to like that song,
but you heard it. Not that good. If I wasn't your friend,
I'd say: ''Dave, you go right back
out of this office... ...and you keep writing music.
You'll get there someday.'' But I am your friend,
so I'm going to tell you... ...that there is no sense
in writing songs... ...that no one is ever,
ever going to sing. Ever? Excuse me. Can I get some of that water? We ran out. Hey! -Out of the way.
-Alvin... -...slow down.
-Move your butt, Theodore. You stepped on my tail. Last one to the door is roadkill. I'm in. What are these shiny things? Theodore, we're leaving now. Okay, this wasn't my best idea.
Look out! Maniac! Back to tree. Back to tree. Back to the dog. Back to the dog! -Basket! Three o'clock.
-Which way is 3 o'clock? -This way.
-Guys, wait for me. Wait up.
I still have baby fat, you know. -Jump. You've gotta really want it.
-I want it. -I want it.
-I can't hang like this all day. Will you jump already? Muffins. Gross. Is this his house? No. It's his garbage can. This must be where he stores
his food for winter. As it came down to one-- Boa has the mouse trapped on a branch
with no way out. As the boa moves in for the attack... ...the mouse
seems to be facing certain death. The boa's sensitive tongue
tastes the victim's presence. The mouse crashes
through the foliage. Come on, baby. Come to papa! Hello, gorgeous. We've hit the mother lode. --tropical rainforest
where food is bountiful. This is the greatest day of my life. Eureka! I found the cheese balls. Alvin, what are you doing?
Don't make a mess. Cannonball. Quick. Hide. Hurry, you guys. Did I put these here? There you are. I got you. He's been out for quite a while. You guys, he's dead. Don't panic. Wipe everything down. I need three garbage bags, a shovel,
some disinfectant... ...some latex gloves and oregano, go! Hang on, Sherlock. He's coming to. I must be hearing things. Oh, this is trippy. Sir, are you all right? Get back! Squirrels can't talk. Hey. Watch it, genius. We are chipmunks. Chipmunks. Chipmunks can't talk either. Our lips are moving
and words are coming out. This is not happening. I am not talking to chipmunks.
I am not talking to chipmunks. So how's that working for you, Dave? How do you know my name? I'll field that one.
We read your mail. By accident. You really ought to pay
that utility bill, Dave. -You ever heard of a credit rating?
-What's this thing? Hey. Hey. Hey.
Stop doing-- Turn that off. Sorry. He fell out of the tree at birth. Can all animals talk? Well, I believe fish
have this type of sign language. Hey, Dave, do all humans have houses
that smell like sweat socks? Dave likes to wear Dirty underwear with little hairs We're getting off on the wrong foot. Allow us to introduce ourselves. Hello, I'm Simon, the smart one. -He's Alvin.
-The awesomest one. And I'm Theodore. Oh, nice to meet you.
Now get out of my house. But we talk. Which makes me want you
out of my house that much more. It's creepy. Unnatural. Somewhat evil. I kind of liked him better
when he was unconscious. -Gotcha.
-Hey. Don't do this, Dave. We can gnaw right through this door. Hi. Oh, were we disturbing you? What, you guys can sing too? That's not singing. This is singing. This is amazing. Here, everyone inside. -There you go.
-Thank you. All right, here's the deal. You guys sing my songs,
you get to sleep here. No. Wait. Is breakfast included? I can live with that. What about TV privileges? Okay, but not after 7. -Eight.
-Done. But don't tell your animal friends,
because I don't wanna come home... ...and find rabbits
and skunks on my couch. Filthy creatures, Dave.
Never associate with them. Yeah, you're our only friend. No, no, no.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. Let's just start with me
being your songwriter. Let me ask you.
Have you ever written a song before? -Yup.
-And is that your music stuff outside? Yup. Oh, no! Hurry back. So, fellas, all we gotta do
is find the right song, rehearse-- -Hey, Dave.
-Simon. My bad. This is my sheet music. Alvin. This is not a Hula-Hoop.
It's a towel rack. -Killjoy.
-Are you guys always like this? We're kids, Dave. Well, where are your parents? When you're a chipmunk, your parents
take care of you for a week. Then they take off. Our parents were hippies.
They left early to join a commune. -I am Robert the Robot.
-Help! Crazy robot. Help! It's after me! -It's after me.
-Hey. Hey. Be careful with that. -Sorry.
-It's a collectible. -I got it for Christmas last year.
-Christmas! We love Christmas. Even though we've never
actually celebrated it. But we want to. Yeah, you can never go wrong
with Christmas. Oh, maybe we can celebrate it
with you. Yeah, maybe. Look, I've had a long and weird day,
so off to bed. Come on. We start work tomorrow. I want you bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed by 8. My tail isn't bushy till 9. Not my problem. Now go to sleep. I hope Christmas comes fast. Me too. Want a plane that loops the loop? Loop. Hoop. Hula-Hoop. Here's trouble. Fire in the hole! What are you guys doing? Nothing. What are you doing? Stand back, Dave. She's gonna blow! I got it. I got it, guys. Come to papa. -Hey. Where did it go?
-Simon, this landed right in front of you. You didn't see it? How many fingers am I holding up? Four. No, no, no.
Eight? Counting your thumb? -Wait, wait, wait--
-Hang on a second. Six. Final answer is six. Try these. How's that? Someone trashed your house. It was clean Well, we colored for a while,
but then we got hungry. Wanna see what we colored? Actually, I wanna play you
something. I wrote a song
for you guys to sing, so let's-- We've put a few toaster waffles
aside for winter. And we're not sharing. Guys, we're gonna have food all winter,
so if you start storing it... ...it's gonna get gross
and we're gonna have rodent.... Bad, you know,
non-talking rodents around here. Let's go. Let's get to work. All right, you chipmunks.
Ready to sing your song? -I'll say we are.
-Yeah. Let's sing it now. -Ready, Simon?
-Okay. -Ready, Theodore?
-Okay. Alvin? Alvin? T"
28137,"Played this cute game for around 7-8 years across a few accounts through most of my late childhood and early adult life. Whenever life was getting me down or something else external was bothering me in any way I would just hop on here and get lost in this beautiful little world. Magic. Thats the only word I can use to describe Terraria in all its greatness. Terraria is pure childhood wonder, bold adventure, and imaginative magic put into video game form. Never before in my life have I come across a game that has left me at a near loss for words when describing its perfection. All I can possibly say to do this game justice is to TELL you, not recommend you, to buy it. I promise you it will be worth it. 

11/10"

28149,"I am 183 years old. My good days are past me, all my friends are dead, and I am very old and sad. I have a 2 year old grandson that became very distant with me as of late, and I wanted to find a way to reconnect with him. I found out he played this game called Terraria, so I made a steam account for free and bought the game. It brought me back to my youth when I went underground and mined for a living and killed god. My life has lost all meaning but Terraria has brought the life back into it. Thank you, Nintendo."
28150,good
28151,"Terraria is a fun 2d version of Minecraft, except it has hundreds of items and experiences that Minecraft cannot offer without mods :)"

28219,"Terarria is a brilliantly designed game.  There is truly nothing like it out there.  Its progression system is meticulously designed to always feel like your character is very strong, but also always challenge you.  The bosses and story progression are all perfect, making the replayability of this game unmatched.  This is proved by my hours that I have amassed on this game.  I am still finding new ways to play this game and have fun with it.  Terarria truly grew up with me and for that I thank the developers for making such an amazing game.  If you are ever considering getting this game, I highly reccomend it."

28223,"Dang, minecraft went 2d and turned into elden ring, still pretty fun"

"
28303,cool
28304,It's good when I'm not dying
28305,"2d minecraft with bosses and clear progression paths also the game can be as easy or as hard as the player wants to make it, with so many things in and to do in the game the biggest complaint i have is it can be hard to know what your supposed to do next without a guide. moreover it can get very boring without an objective because there is nothing to tell you what you need or should do next thats why it can be hard at times but like any similar games google your problem this game has a very active and great community and are willing to help any new players. this is one of my fav games."
28306,terraria. a very good game. its an rpg which most people think is boring but terraria is much more. how terraria harnesses the 2D worldbox and the pixels to create a masterpiece better than even some 3D games. the variety of enemies and weapons is unbearable.
28307,this game is really fun buy it
28308,so far this is one of the best games i've ever played
28309,"its nice and lots of bosses and tools

28357,Good game
28358,god
28359,"its really fun and creative
"
28360,"Terraria is very addicting because you always have something to do.Such s defeating bosses,building houses for NPCs and adventuring around the map,and more other stuff to do.I beat the game on mobile,on ps4,on Xbox,and PC.That`s how addicting the game is!!
To be honest,there was a long period between the playthroughs but the one thing that always brought me back to playing this game is the memories.I have been playing terraria since after one month after it was released.
I started playing with my cousins and brothers,but they eventually stopped playing the game,so I decided to beat the game on my own on several consoles I mentioned earlier,the more I played the game,the more i got more addicted to it.It is very fun to adventure around the 2d world and fight many different mobs and bosses and getting incredible loot.
Thank you terraria developers,for creating such a beautiful,and godly game.I will never forget this game,no matter what happens too the game!!"
28361,fun game. havent played it much yself but 'tis is good
28362,"i have 46 hours in this game yet i dont remember anything

10/10"
28363,This game is really fun but it's definitely not for everyone. You basically [i] need [/i] to look up a bunch of tutorials or read the wiki to understand what to do and even I look at the wiki all the time for crafting recipes etc. None the less the game is really fun and for only 10$ it's a steal
28364,very fun game when you dont know what to do
28365,fun game to play with friends
28366,Very good.
28367,"good gam

28375,I've played it for a few hours and its a pretty fun game.
28376,"literally a good game

except if u play hardcore for the worthy master mode as a summoner"
28377,"good for people that like to explore a world full of strange and dangerous things. also for those masochists out there when in the world create menu put ""for the worthy"" in the seed and select master mode"

Wayy better than minecraft, i found myself enjoying this and being able to stay commited longer than other survival games just because of the sheer amount of things you can do pre and post hardmode"
28402,Great game with so much to do!

28409,"sus
"
28410,it make u like females if u play for too long so very bad
28411,Very cool game. It is more entertaiment than the minecraft because there are new things to explore and to craft
28412,o
28413,good game but gets boring fast so best to play in small amonts{yes i know i cant spell}
28414,"Terraria is an awesome game, i've played since 1.2 and have over 1000hrs. i would give this game 9.5/10 because it has provided me and my friends so much enjoyment. The only problem i have with it is that for beginners this game can be very overwhelming with so many items and things to do you get lost very easily. i would recommend this game to pretty much anyone whether you're playing solo or with friends Terraria is an absolute blast."
28415,its is vary fun to play on your free time
28416,"its like doom, except not really"
28417,pre ight

28423,"good to play with friends
"
28424,"lots of worms in this game, i always got worms on me, i have a compost in my room to raise worms, i always have like 10 to 15 worms on me, i stay strapped. just last week this lady tried to pepperspray me, threw some worms at her. love the worms in this game, some are pretty big. wondering if they could add more worms"
28425,10/10
28426,1
28427,"What i found about the game is that its overly difficult to invite friends, despite trying all other possibilityies me and my friends simply couldnt get it to work. other than that its a good game"
28428,its ok
28429,Aesome gameeeeeee
28430,"Excellent game, won't be bored even I have spent so much time on it."

28444,very well balanced challange game but during the first mech boss you fight its nearly impossible to beat for me at least
28445,It really is everything you're hoping it is.
28446,"Hours and hours of replay-ability. You can spend over 500 hours on one character playing one way, then start a new world a month or two later using a different build and its so fresh and fun every time! I highly recommend you spend the low amount for this game, its especially fun with friends and mods!"
28447,fdfesgtrdtrhf
28448,A great game but not heaps of replay value
28449,buh.
28450,"its a great grindy game to hang out with friends on.  Discord is a requirment as you cant talk to people in game.
It is extreamly in depth and to do everything there is to do in a single world will take hundreds of hours.  Its a great game to talk to friends, listen to music and chill."
28451,yes game do game good
28452,one of my favorite games
28453,best sandbox of all time

28457,good
28458,"even tho this game is well-recognized, I still feel it deserves more love"
28459,"Was questioning whether to buy this game or not. I've always thought that it was just a ""2D Minecraft"" Like many other people, however it's completely different! You just cant stop, the progression is fluid, there's so much to explore and the list goes on. 10/10 would recommend!!"
28460,Good.
28461,i just can't fathom the early game. how is this fun to play?
28462,all of the above
28463,its cooolll
28464,its good i guess

28469,this game is very good
28470,"on god goated, it isnt hard its fun and people can go sweat on calamity"

28481,"its just good
"
28482,good game
28483,I havent seen the light of day in 5 months
28484,9.5/10 Great game and I would probably buy it again. Note: I personally think its a lot more fun with friends but Single player is still pretty fun.
28485,"really fun, so much content, and extremely cheap. I would suggest to anyone and everyone!"
28486,yes

28492,Great game
28493,"Its a good game, trust me, I love myself."
28494,"The characters are creative and the gear is good. The only thing I dont like in it is the Wall of Flesh. Coming from a new person and not knowing it gives you hardmode, its hard. But I like the game overall."
28495,"sick game i played it.
this along with csgo and l4d2 make having a computer worht it for real sic"
28496,good game but not my fav
28497,i like this game i like playing with my brother
28498,masterpiece
28499,pretty new but so far seems okay
28500,very fun
28501,game honestly kinda boring ngl. dont even recommend tmodloader (the community in there is pretty bad. calamity people there). cant recommend less. only play because of already playing previously. just play something like dead cells instead.
28502,"Please buy it. It's way more than 2D Minecraft, but you probably already know that. I played it by screen sharing my game to a friend and him hinting at what I should do next, but if you follow the achievement list to the right of your inventory, you'll know what to do. 17 bosses that are all really fun to fight, multiplayer support, EXTREMELY polished visuals and mechanics. This game is incredibly addicting, I highly recommend it."
28503,"The game overall is good. Similar to Minecraft, but 2-d, more complicated, and with very different mechanics. Would recommend, however pulling up the wiki is advised."
28504,ohh my god
28505,Love this game. Been playing it since Xbox 360 days and PC makes it better
28506,good game
28507,"good game would reccomend

28516,is fun
28517,good game
28518,the best game on steam. literally
28519,much fun
28520,"Terraria is a brilliant game.

Many people in the past have said that ""Terraria is just 2D Minecraft"". With 366 hours currently I can confidently say IT IS NOT 2D MINECRAFT IT ISNT ITS NOT. 
There are plenty of things to do in Terraria, a vast collective of chores and quests that leave me at the edge of my seat. Some of the best examples of these would be mining and crafting.
The game is super fun and addicting. However, not everything is perfect. It took me around 360 hours of playing the game to finally discover how to jump; and this was from a third party guide I saw, not from the actual developers. 

Overall good game, still don't know how to make a crafting table though."
28521,The enemies in the game kept me really engaged. Dying surprisingly made me more motivated to get more powerful. Thank you for this masterpiece!
28522,epic game
28523,Hands down one of the best games ever made.
28524,This game is very fun to play! Especially in Journey mode.
28525,"Cool
"
28526,S'alright I guess
28527,WWWW
28528,"A more action filled take on the mining and crafting genre in my opinion, simple but nice visuals and lots of content. Fun game."
28529,Very chill. Has nice vibes to it and perfect for long distance date nights!
28530,pretty good game
28531,good stats for the cost

Its so easy to use and its definetly worth it!"

I always love returning because there is always something to do. I mean come on, what other survival game has a Space Dolphin Machine Gun. You can trust me on this one, the hours I have on this game is unreal (253 to be exact). And that's just the tip of the iceberg, I started playing on other devices way before PC Terraria. If you are wondering what game to play, I highly recomend."

Get the game.

28816,"Terraria is a little difficult for new players, but reading through a guide and watching a playthrough or two can help new players really get into it. Terraria has subtle lore and epic character designs and gameplay, and it's one of the funnest yet most difficult games i've played so far"

28818,haha zenith go brrrr

28970,good game
28971,Played this game across several platforms for most of my childhood but the 150 hours I put in once I got a PC isn't enough to describe how great this game is. Really deserves the Labor of Love award. Could not recommend it more.
28972,this has to be one of the best games on steam

Chad Game 11/10"
28985,its ok
28986,"I am a 54 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
28987,"Lookin for a game to buy? Buy this! Great exploring, boss fights, and very fun gameplay overall!"
28988,a
28989,epic killllll
28990,"I know I don't have many hours, but this game made my friend's and I childhoods. We've met through video games and we developed our friendship with this one. If you like this type of games you'll find the graphics mesmerizing."
28991,cool
28992,good
28993,"While this game is frequently called ""The 2D Minecraft,"" the similarities between the games seem to end after you punch trees and make a table to craft things. there are obviously more similarities, but this game, in a lot of ways, has so much more to do. This game has a far larger variety of weapons, armors, and tools. along with this, there is a far longer progression with many, many bosses. I am not saying this is better than Minecraft, just different. they are both definitely worth a buy."
28994,this is such a good game... JUST PLAY IT

29130,This game is amazing. The only negative comment I have about it is that there is too much creativity. It is a fun and free game to do whatever you like with many fascinating topics and items.
29131,This game is the sword
29132,"Don't let the art style fool you. This game is more deep and engaging than GTA 5, Fallout 4, Skyrim, Borderlands 2 and might even have more content too. I've been playing this game for a LONG time and it has been incedible watching the game evolve and grow. Terraria is utterly colossal and it's a fraction of the price of many lesser games.

My wife and I have spent literal weeks worth of time playing this together and not only are we still playing, the game is still being updated and improved. Don't wait for a sale, just buy the game, it will run on nearly anything.

The entire games industry (and maybe the world) would be a better place if more developers and publishers were like RE-LOGIC."

29184,"yeah man you know its its yeah man you know its like, i play this game quite a lot, i play since little boy you know so this game is you know like i mean what im trying to say is it is just a game that people play and I saw recently it was 9th on the most purchased game so my reaction was like ""wow"" and then i got on steam and looked at terraria for a good minute and saw ""write a review"" so im writing a review on this game that is just like really something, you relate my friend? i mean this game is just something. its better than other games and also worse than other games you know like its a game created by humans for other humans to play which makes sense but why dont they make robots create a game, and then after the game gets created the ai learns more and more to mear human domination and forces everyone to delete this game that is good i recommend
:D"
29185,"Jesus fucking christ stop thinking and buy it, it is OBJECTIVELY the best damn game you will ever play even if you dont use mods. Who ever thinks I am wrong is just not smart enough to see the greatness of this masterpiece"

Jump in, explore and see what happens!"

29306,"Terraria is honestly a masterpiece of a game. I have a long and strange relationship with this game that started when I was around 13 years old. My brother and I received an Xbox as one of our first gaming consoles and Terraria was one of our first games. My brother became obsessed, while I grew to resent Terraria for whatever reason my preteen brain could come up with. That being said whenever I played Terraria I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Later I got Terraria on my 3ds and even my phone, and now I have finally purchased it for my computer. I will never forget the memories I have from this game past, present, or future. It is worth the buy, and at only $10 you get a lot of bang for your buck."

29334,yes
29335,"im buying the 4 pack
you should too
unless you dont have friends
then just buy it standalone"
29336,"Although this game seems very challenging at the beginning after watching a couple simple YouTube videos i quickly grasped the concept of the game and begun quickly advancing through. I have over 40 hrs of play time so far and i have enjoyed every second. The wide choice of weapons, armor, gear, and even blocks is amazing. The ability to fight any boss more then once was also a really good idea that i enjoy. The only criticism I have for the game is that is seems really tough to progress in the beginning and can be overwhelming to some players and turn them away. This could be fixed by creating a tutorial section with the guide that is a little more hands on then just vague suggestions. I may be ignorant to some features in the game so please let me know if there is anything like this already in the game .  Thankyou Re-Logic Team for this wonderful game"
29337,"Yessirrr
"
29338,yes <3
29339,"Decent, would play again."
29340,Fun Game
29341,Terraria
29342,"splendid, great for engaging multiplayer experience"
29343,It's kinda got a Minecraft vibe but pixelated. Super fun to play either way! The only thing I would personally change is how long the night is compared to how long the day is. The day always feels way shorter than the night. Is that just me or? üòÇ

29356,"Lots of bosses, lots of items, lots of content , what's not to love?"
29357,"I seriously recommend Terraria to anybody who likes open world survival games. It has quite a bit of items and after every playthrough i discover something new, great combat imo and lots and i mean LOTS of enemies to fight. It has a lot of replay ability because of the sheer amount of items and mobs, also because of proceduraly generated world which rival even the likes of Minecraft. 

Again I recommend this game to anybody really, its just amazing"
29358,Amazing game for a very low price
29359,"you either have 30 minutes, 300 hours or 3000 hours on this game. No in between."
29360,played a little looks fun
29361,"9/10 game as of 2020

low price, amazing gameplay. 

This game is one of the best games out there. Anybody could play it young or old. Game has a never ending touch that leaves you wanting to play more. My favorite part of this game is the replayability, you can take multiple paths and strategies to beat the game. Every play-though is different. Guaranteed fun with friends. Worth the 10 dollars. Better than Minecraft"
29362,Wasn't prepared for how massive this game really is!
29363,The game that makes you feel like a god and feel like a pawn in a span of one boss fight. 10/10
29364,VERY GOOD *Indian accent.
29365,is good
29366,"Love the game, solid 9/10, I've spent like 8 hours a day for the past 3 days with my friends playing this game. 

As someone who came late to this game, I can describe it like this:
It's like rediscovering Minecraft.
But this time you have guns, and loads of bosses, and loads of cool references, and magic, and lots of cool loot that makes you feel like jesus christ himself! If, like me, you are a latecomer to this game, PLEASE don't hesitate and just go for it, it'll pull you in and it won't let go!

29367,"Big stonks.
liked the grass texture.
would recommend."
29368,ice ice baby
29369,"If any of you have played console Terraria, I'm sure you know how hard it is to be precise in that game. Its hard, so after a while you give up and never wanna play again because of that. Then you get a laptop. You see that Terraria is dirt cheap. With the lowest required specs for a laptop, something a laptop for school can run. And then you play. And you don't stop playing it. I just bought it recently and I've been spending as much time as possible on it because it is insanely addictive and so much better now that I can actually be precise.

9/10"
29370,Always have an itch to come back once in awhile.
29371,"i dont have any friends to play it with, but when i did have friends to play it with, it was pretty fun and addicting like gambling. i suggest buying it unless you have no friends. dont worry, its fun singleplayer, but it's different with friends.

overall, i think it's a great game"

29408,"end racism fr
"
29409,"Terraria is fantastic. There's a lot to do, between building, combat, fishing, and exploring. I adore it. If you like Minecraft, definitely try Terraria. It's well worth the $10 and a great game overall."

29432,good
29433,Yes.
29434,GOATED game everyone should consider playing
29435,add sex
29436,"I originally got this on Xbox, but then I borrowed Terraria from my friend and the first thing I notices was the more intuitive controls. overall great!"
29437,"Honestly quite an incredible game. Terraria has an almost endless amount of content that just about anyone can enjoy. Play it alone or with friends, both offer a unique and fun experience you can easily sink multiple hours into many times over. Not only is the game itself great in my opinion, but the devs genuinely care about it and are constantly still at work fixing bugs, adding quality of life changes and even still updating it. Not even to mention the incredibly large array of resource packs created by the community to spice up the game. Want to replace the music with that of one of your favorite games/anime? The community has you covered. Wish every female npc had massive tits? There's at least 100 resource packs for that. Overall incredible game for a great price, 10/10 would recommend."

29448,its a very good game with lots of things to be made and lots of creativety and on the scale i would honestly give this game a 10/10
29449,"I believe this is one of the best games you can ever play. 
Its a game you can play and never get tired of.
There is so much content and achievements you can get. 
Its a great game to grind at or just to pass the time with.
Tip: Game is a lot more enjoyable when playing with friends :)

29502,"This is not 2D Minecraft. Although it has similar features like, Tool progression through mining, mining - crafting = upragrading and so on, it is not even close to being the same game.

Terraria is a sandbox, boss fighter game. You mine to craft better gear and tools, scavenge caves and skies to gather resources and magical items. You do this to defeat the first boss of the roster consisting of 10's of bosses. You defeat the first boss, get loot, scavenge some more, get better gear and tools so that you can defeat stronger enemies. After gathering and crafting better gear and tools, you defeat the second boss. The second boss is chosen, based on what biome your world is made of. You either fight the eater of worlds or brain of cthulu. It is also important to say that this game, is in no way linear. The game lets you, as the player, choose wether you want to defeat the eater of worlds/brain of cthulu before or after you have defated the first boss. I (in this review) am only writing the bosses with the number that i usually defeat them in. This game gives you full, 100% freedome. Later on, you even have to make a choice, wether you want to be a mage, range, tank, and so on. Your gear, tools, weapons, Magical items, mana, health, ect. makes you the class you want, you can even be a hyprid amd choose to be a mage/range, meaning you have full mana bar and a lot of ammo, with a mix of both range and magic type accesories in your inventory. You heard me, accesories. In terreria you have accesories, accesories are items with stats that gives you abilities or buffs. fx. If you are fond of the class ''tank'' you would usually use a strong, expensive sword, that deals a heavy amount of damage.you can then equip a wide assortment of accesories that enhances the sword, giving the sword damage buffs, fire effect ect. accesories isn't weapon exclusive, some also affect yourself. Some makes you 50% less vulnerable to ex. ice hostiles, where others makes you able to fly or run really fast. 

You can also build in this game. The level of creative freedome in this game when it comes to building is incredible, even more than minecraft. Though it is hidden by the 2D format, your options are near limitless, with thousands of blocks and materials and the hammer tool, making you able to rotate blocks in manyways, makes building so liberating and free.

Npc's are also a big part of Terraria. After you have built your house (or while you're building it) having rooms decorated in a certain way (1x chair, 1x Table, big enough room, wall/background, and light source) npcs will automatically move in. The more rooms + the more you progress in Terraria, the more npcs move into your house. You can even build a village for them if you so please, become the ruler of your own village. Some Npcs, you find while exploring, or after you defeat a specific boss. All the npcs in the game has their own personality and meaning, including their own shop or ''ability'' some of them heal you when you need it (maybe during a boss battle or event like bloodmoon or invasion) (invasion of goblins, pirates, aliens and more) ( events like snow, slime, halloween and more) other npcs sell you items that you can you can use to decorate your house with, some sell weapons and tools, some buffs your weapons and accesories for money, and some just gives you money. 

If you are more of a technic-like player, you will probably like making automatic farms and other types of contraptions.

All of this is just a part of the game, there is so much more. But if you still don't feel like giving the game a chance after reading this review, then the game is probably just not for you. But for me, this is a 10/10"
29503,"I love this Minecraft modpack, very cool"
29504,"dont play , sucks a lot of time"
29505,wes
29506,"its very good game
"
29507,Idk why am i writing this down right now after 1 year of pc completion but the best 2d game in the world!

29517,"Good, Just good.
Decent game to play with friends and family,
and a 2d game with endless ideas."
29518,Recommend it
29519,"This game has real magic! A complete joy to play! So much time spent creating and having adventures! A+ music and sound effects, Cute animations and FX. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a casual game to unwind and enjoy playing any day of the week!"
29520,This game is slightly addicting
29521,do dodo do dod odododododo dodo dod od od aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa monster
29522,tbh its kinda a rip off of terraria ngl
29523,yes
29524,"Go download Calamity mod. The game's awesome, why not make it even more awesome?"
29525,"have to be honest with you, if u want to find a game that has a mixture between RPG and survival elements, so this game is the right one to play !"
29526,"I've been playing terraria for over 5 years now. Started out on mobile when it got to 1.2, now playing it in almost its final form. There isn't a single thing in this game that I dislike. It is an absolute masterpiece that deserves all the love it gets. I only have 365 hours on PC. Overall, it is probably closer to 1,000 hours, combining mobile, console, and PC hours. One thing that I do wish is a way to limit particle effects. I play on a MacBook Air, and every time there is an abundance of particles on the screen, my frames drop dramatically. It is a huge problem with summoners, since the Kaleidoscope creates a lot of particles, bringing my game down to 5 fps. That is my only complaint throughout my many years of playing.

One of my greatest memories is defeating the Moon Lord for the first time. Going from mobile to PC felt like a whole knew world opened up (especially the field of view considering you could only see maybe 10 pixels on the screen at once during that time). Console was great as well, aside from how buggy it was with multiplayer. Having friends over playing 4 player split screen was a lot of fun. After about a half hour or so, the game would start to break, but that's what happens when you essentially have 4 different games running at once on a crappy PS4.

To end the review, I want to personally thank Re-Logic for creating a game that never got old. A game that will forever go down as one of the best games in history. The developers (mainly Redigit and Cenx) are super active in the community, always listening and using ideas from the player base to add to the game. Thank you for having a major impact on my childhood."
29527,God-tier game

29533,"This has to be one of my absolute favorite game I have ever purchased! I Feel like I can keep coming back to this game even if there isn't anything new or exciting. I am in love with the amount of creativity you can have within this game. The overall best part of the game has to be the different enemies you can fight and defeat, Such as Eye of Cuthulu, Eater of Worlds, Wall of Flesh, and etc...

This game is a must have in my opinion and I suggest getting the game."
29534,"Damn near infinite replayability in its base game, and combined with T-Mod Loader (which is free mind you), you'll have endless hours of fun. If you liked Minecraft, but wish it were more action oriented, then Terraria might just be the game for you."

29562,"Not much to say about this legendary game. If you want a neigh limitless sandbox game with an actual goal to work towards, Terraria is your game. This is one of the most fantastic purchases you can make, hundreds of hours for just a couple of bucks. If I only got to have three games total on my PC, Terraria would be one of them, and I could almost always be entertained."
29563,it very sus ngl
29564,"I have played through the whole game on journey, classic, expert, and master modes and I can wholeheartedly say that I had fun every time. The gameplay never gets old because of the hundreds of different weapons, and ways that you can play the game. The boss fights are phenomenal as well.

29569,"So, I've started playing terraria when there wasn't really much in this game, when it purely just came out. And to be honest, time passed and the game changed ALOT, for the better of course. I really recommend this game to people who want to let their creativity out, or to people who love to explore. in general this game is just a great game for people of almost every taste in my opinion, it really deserved the labor of love award and I think its sad the developers are stopping the development on this game, it has the potential to have so much more, but therefore we have the modding community, which is a great wholesome and wonderful community, all in all this game is one of the games that are old but still shining bright like pure gold."

However, I got addicted after the first 5 hours of playing with my brother-in-law and son online. We played in one world together as I learned how to build up my character and inventory. I would recommend to everyone to at least give it a try and be open minded as it draws you in for some online fun with others."

The player is completely free to do what they want; they can dig a hole down to the bottom of hell and fly up to the heavens and beyond.
This game transcend the concept of fantasy, it meshes together the classic medieval fantasy with sci-fi, steampunk and anything you can imagine and more. It has a unique and chaotic personality that's extremely well crafted and it works perfectly with its retro-pixely style.

An absolute master piece."

29665,good game
29666,"Disclaimer: At this point I'm pretty burned out on large-scale adventure games, so usually I steer clear of them, but Terraria piqued my interested recently so I gave it another shot. Thus, I'm not going to review the adventure side of the game. Also, I only play with a gamepad, and while it is a bit awkward, I'm generally satisfied with how comprehensive the support is and it's hard to think of how it could be better.

One of the biggest turn-offs for me is that the scale and proportions of the objects in the game really don't work. The blocks are too small and make it really unpleasant to build or dig. (However, the grid-snapping feature with the direction pad is a lifesaver.) Zooming in the view is a must. Also, it's really annoying to figure out what proportions work for buildings, mineshafts, etc. to make player movement convenient. One thing I noticed in particular is that the player can clear some gaps in one direction but not the other.

I liked the idea of a 2D Metroidvania-ish adventure game with a creative side, but these fundamental design quirks ruin the fun for me."

29672,"[h1] Terraria [/h1]

Many people have drawn comparisons between Terraria and Minecraft. If you are one of the those people that think Terraria is a rip off of Minecraft or vise versa, it is important to note that the two games inherently have different audiences. Minecraft is a open sandbox, where there isn't much (besides defeating the Ender Dragon to do). A key aspect of Minecraft is being able to build, whether it be a small house or a large castle. Minecraft also has a much wider appeal, with servers allowing players to play mini games or play story maps. Terraria has some similarities but it's main aspect is becoming more powerful and exploring the world as you play. Creating builds is somewhat important but there isn't really something similar to Minecraft's Creative mode to build grandiose builds. Now that we understand that Terraria is a whole different game, let's talk about the key aspects that make up a game.

[h1] Story [/h1]

One of the aspects of some sandbox games is the lack of story. Terraria has some semblance of lore but the story isn't the main aspect of the game. You are a player, who spawns into a new world. You must gather materials and defeat enemies to survive and improve.

[h1] Characters [/h1]

The characters of Terraria are interesting in some ways. While not all of them have lore or characterisation, it is interesting to see how certain characters are connected.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The gameplay of Terraria is arguably the main reason why this game is as liked as it is. You have a variety of biomes, with unique enemies and unique items. There is also unique ore and weapons you are able to collect. The main way you progress in Terraria is defeating bosses. Each one has a unique attack pattern and design, helping them become memorable. Some bosses need a specific item. Some bosses have to be in a certain biome. Some bosses require you to have beaten other bosses. Overcoming each one helps the player realise how powerful they are becoming as they are able to obtain tools, that help to mine certain ore or blocks quicker. There isn't just the bosses though. There are also the NPCs, which offer specific items to help achieve certain things. Each NPC has a unique sprite, unique ways that you obtain them, unique animations and items. Overall, Terraria has various things that players can do, that keeps them from being bored.

[h1] Mods [/h1]

it is important to talk about the mods for Terraria as a lot of them help elevate the experience. One of the more notable mods is the Calamity Mod. This adds new weapons, new enemies, new items and even new bosses. It is so massive that it has it's own dedicated wiki to help players. The Calamity Mod isn't the only mod players can experience but players can search through them using the Steam Workshop and loading them through TModLoader, a separate free application.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Terraria is a game that I believe is an essential part of someone's Steam library. With lots of ways to play the game (Single player, Multiplayer, Journey Mode, Normal Mode, Expert and Master Mode) and the ease of access to mods, Terraria provides many opportunities to allow players to play their game their own way. The only nitpick I have is Journey Mode, namely the fact that you have to ""research"" items, weapons etc. in order to duplicate them. Some only need to be researched once but some need to be researched 99 times or more. A way they could improve this is remove the grind to get duplicate items as many players don't want to waste hours gathering specific materials.

Rating: 9/10 (A Must for anyone, unless you really dislike combat and just want to build stuff only without grinding)."
29673,fun
29674,"If you're the type of person to get into the hype that is this game don't get deceived by the game's slow and uneventful start. 
The game doesn't explain itself so you either read a wiki guide on how to progress or play with an experienced friend (much more enjoyable).
If none of these options suit you, the world provides you with a Guide NPC. He will give a vague direction on where to explore and teach you the crafting recipes, although this path will take significantly longer.

If you're an experienced gamer or like a challenge, I recommend starting with Expert mode. It's hard but has more content in it.

Honestly, just start the game by exploring, mining and getting better equipment. The game has loads of weapons and armor to choose from. 

After that start looking to fight against bosses like the Eye Of Cthulu. Then the game will slowly open itself up. 

Be patient and enjoy the game!"

29698,"The Golem card is unlocked from the Hog Mountain (Arena 10). It is a slow, single-target, melee troop with extremely high hitpoints and moderate damage. When defeated, the Golem explodes, dealing area damage, pushing smaller foes nearby while spawning two Golemites which behave identically but with much weaker stats. The Golem is a colossal, menacing rock brute with team colored crystals growing on its back, while its Golemites appear similarly but are smaller with only one eye. A Golem card costs 8 Elixir to deploy.

[b] Strategy [/b]
An effective strategy with the Golem is to deploy the Golem behind the King's Tower. Due to the Golem's long deploy time and movement speed, the player will have time to generate Elixir and place other troops behind the Golem to make the push extremely effective and difficult to counter. High damage, spell resistant troops are the most effective as they make up for the Golem's low damage per second and still elicit another response as the push crosses the bridge. However, this costs a heavy amount of Elixir, and will leave the player fairly vulnerable for an enemy push in the other lane. Workarounds to this are waiting until the last minute where double Elixir starts, or to use the Elixir Collector to obtain an Elixir advantage.
Note that the Golem has a 3 second deploy time. This makes placing it at the bridge a very situational thing to do as it will be very easy to react to, and the player will not have much Elixir in hand to support it.
The same idea applies to placing the Golem on the opponent's side. The 3 second deploy time will allow the opponent to deal significant damage to the Golem before it starts walking. It can also be exploited by placing a building further away from the Golem's intended target, and can even change which Crown Tower the Golem heads towards after the building expires.
The Golem's death damage is enough to take down any unit with as much or less health than Lava Pups. Tornado can reel poorly spaced defenders into the explosion, and allow the player to fully take out Archers, Princesses, Dart Goblins, or Minions. Ranged units should be at their maximum range, away from the Golem's destination, to prevent unnecessary damage and to make it harder for a Tornado to reel them towards the Golem.
The Golemites also deal area damage upon death, but it is insignificant compared to the health of most cards, only being able to one shot Skeletons and Bats of equal level. This is still useful in taking out these defending foes since it will often allow one Golemite to survive without any defending troops left, letting it deal some chip damage.
Although the Golem spawns Golemites upon death, buildings and troops will start targeting troops behind the Golem since it takes a split second for the Golemites to spawn and the closest targets will be the troops the Golem is protecting. This can easily be fixed by placing a spell such as Zap, Lightning, or Freeze, which can all stun or freeze the Tower changing its target to the Golemites instead. An Ice Spirit or Electro Wizard could also work, but they are blockable and may result in a waste of Elixir.
A Golem is a very effective tank against an X-Bow or a Mortar. Place him at the maximum range of the building to accumulate some Elixir to support the Golem, otherwise the Golem will be overwhelmed by the building's defenders if it is placed directly on the building.
The opponent may try to lure your support troops to the other lane with an Ice Golem, separating them from the Golem. This can be cancelled out by a Tornado, which despite being a negative Elixir trade is still more valuable than letting all the support troops be kited away.
Many buildings provide effective support to distract and damage down a Golem. Even those which do not directly attack can be useful as they can separate the Golem from its support troops.
The Inferno Tower and Inferno Dragon can easily destroy a Golem for a positive Elixir trade if allowed to reach maximum damage stage. The player should always consider packing a card with a stun effect, as this will allow the player to reset the opposing Inferno card's charge and help a Golem push force its way through the defensive building.
Zap is the cheapest and most consistent method of resetting an Inferno card, but it will often not be enough to prevent the Golem from being incinerated unless the Golem has other support troops behind it. Lightning will deal much more damage in addition to stunning, and can also target and fully destroy many glass cannons like the Musketeer or Wizard.
Another method to counter the Inferno Tower is to deploy swarm air troops such as Bats or Minion Horde at the middle of the river. These will distract or simply destroy the Inferno Tower due to its sluggish targeting time. However, these can be spelled down on reaction, leaving the Golem helpless. A Night Witch can continually spawn Bats while being resistant to spells, and her Bats are hard to deal with without a spell in hand as the Golem will be tanking the Princess Tower's shots.
Troops with a shield like Guards or a Dark Prince can stall the Inferno Tower for additional time. Their shields will cause the Inferno Tower to reset on its own when it takes down their shields.
Some Inferno Tower users may play their Inferno Tower at the bridge and slightly into the other lane to avoid the Golem player from using Lightning on both their Princess Tower and Inferno Tower. An Electro Wizard or Electro Dragon are the most effective units in this situation as they will continually stun until the building is destroyed, and then support the Golem on the counterpush, while also being very difficult to block.
The Barbarian Hut is the most effective spawner building at destroying the Golem. The spawned Barbarians will deal high damage to the Golem, preventing it from reaching a Princess Tower with its death damage. Some Barbarians will survive, allowing for a small counterpush.
The P.E.K.K.A. is a fairly reliable counter to the Golem. She has enough damage per second to defeat the Golem before it can attack a Princess Tower, and possesses sufficient health to withstand a good number of support troop attacks. This is also a positive Elixir trade since she only costs 7 Elixir, while the Golem costs 8, not accounting for the support troops behind it. A Mini P.E.K.K.A. can achieve similar results to the P.E.K.K.A but needs to have the other support troops taken out first as it cannot withstand too much damage.
The Skeleton Army is a risky but rewarding counter. While it can be easily taken out by spells and splash units, its damage per second for 3 Elixir will easily demolish the Golem. The death explosion is not large enough to destroy all the Skeletons, meaning that the surviving ones will defeat the Golemites.
The Guards can finish off a weakened Golem reliably. Their shields will allow them survive the Golem's death damage, and they will quickly destroy the Golemites, although they will likely be defeated in the process
Avoid attacking in the same lane of a Golem. This will allow the opponent to defend with troops that were intended to support the Golem, which will be much harder to defend afterwards with a Golem in front of them. Attacking in the opposite lane is more effective. This is because most troops must be played in the same lane as a push in order to defend effectively, meaning they will not be able to support the Golem in the other lane. The Golem player must choose to either abandon their expensive Golem push, which makes their troops a lot easier to address separately, or ignore the attack, taking massive damage.
A Fisherman is very effective against a Golem push. He can either be played in the other lane to drag the Golem as far away as possible from its supportive troops and even force it to switch lanes, or he can be played in front of the King's Tower to lure the Golem to it and activate it.

29734,"Terraria is a game that I think will remain in our hearts forever. While the 2D art style may not be for everyone, the sheer amount of content included with the game is simply insane. Ever since my Grandfather bought me Terraria for my 9th birthday, back on the Xbox 360, I was addicted and I don't think I've ever got bored of terraria. While i only have 150 hours of gameplay on my PC, that of course doesn't take into account the thousands of hours on other platforms.

After a good 10-20 minutes I got the hang of it and was exploring the underground, building beautiful building to house my NPCs, and fight amazing bosses. I never fully beat the game on ps4 but got really close. December 26 2019. I build my shiny new pc and the game I first bought was Terraria. I had a blast! The community was better than I ever imagined it would be, the vast ocean of items to use! Millions of blocks to expose my inner builder. It was love at first site. The are vivid in picture with nice sprites for each object and weapon you find. October 5th 2021. Still was playing Terraria and never got bored, being teased with the update called Journey's End really hyped me up but also made have lots of sorrow knowing that there would be no more major updates. Journey's End releases and it was amazing!!! march 3rd 2022. Dont Starve and terraria crossover!!! Played that and it was amazin!! So Terraria fans... WE STILL will be getting those juicy updates.

"
29795,this game is pretty poggers
29796,"I had this game since I was a kid and I still have fond memories of playing through it, through all the updates. Terraria is a creation from hard work and years of effort, and though I don't play it much today it always feels nice coming back to play a run. It is one of my favorite games because of this."
29797,Very fun yet very time consuming for newer players. I've been playing this game for a while and I still enjoy this game to this day. Definitely recommend for players who are looking for a different experience than most games.
29798,Its way too cool for you not too play
29799,Great game imo
29800,"great game, been playing since I was 7."
29801,its not 2-D minecraft.

29805,very good and better with friends
29806,pretty fun game you just gotta rely on the wiki pages to know what you're doing
29807,shit
29808,"This game is amazing. The graphics take awhile to get used to (at least for me), but they grow on you overtime. The bosses are fun an balanced, there are hundreds of items, and it is overall really fun! I 100% recommend buying this game."
29809,1
29810,very good been playing forever
29811,It was alright
29812,"I love the soundtrack to the game, so nostalgic and amazing."
29813,"[h1] This game is AMAZING. [/h1]

If you are looking for a fun, sandbox, base-building, Minecraft sort of game, this game is the one for you. There are endless items you can get in this game, ranging from statues, to shooting stars from the sky. This game's soundtrack is also one of the best I have ever heard in my whole life, and it adds to the amazing fun you can have playing this game."
29814,"Writing a review for this game is like writing a review for The Shawshank Redemption - do you really need me to tell you that Terraria is good? I spent on this game about as much as it costs to buy a cup of coffee in this day and age, and it has consumed so much of my life that the Terraria wiki is lodged more firmly in my brain than anything the education system could've ever hoped to teach me.

Terraria is this eldritch conglomeration of so many things that I love in video games. A truly staggering amount of content has been added to the game in the decade since its release entirely for free (with one last batch on the way too!), the devs have gone above and beyond when it comes to catering to the fans and ensuring that everyone is as happy as possible playing their game, and the creativity of the community just boggles the mind. The possibilities really are endless.

Terraria is a mastercraft passion project that deserves the attention of any lover of the genres it encompasses. Again - I shouldn't have to tell you what thousands of others have already said and in much greater detail, but this game deserves every last ounce of reverence it receives.

Just stop reading my mindless gushing and buy it, alright?"

29825,"Very enjoyable, I find it harder to enjoy without friends though. Of course you have tModLoader for mods and more fun but this isnt rating that app, this is rating Terraria as a game. I personally enjoy it with friends and have spent 70+ Hours so far. Would reccomend purchasing, especially if you have a big friend group to play with."

29910,Objectively the best game of all time no one can say otherwise. Elden Ring difficulty aint shit until you try for the worthy master mode. Melania can suck my ass if she thinks she could stand a fuckin chance against the Empress of light during the day.

29925,"It's very fun to play. There is a lot of items that you can craft. Which you will kill bosses and even players with. So the game has multiplayer which is very cool. it has a lot of modes like: hardcore, softcore and more. there is also biomes which some appier after you have finsihed the first stage. So if youre a creative person i recomend this game."
29926,"Absolutely love Terraria; I played it almost 10 years ago, I think, but now it is an entirely different game!! 
Though, for anyone who is a completionist, as I sometimes am, it is a bit overwhelming, but once you get past that nagging need for 100% and just have fun, it is a world of borderline endless possibilities! So much to do, I doubt I have even scratched the surface, tbch. Great game thus far, 9.5/10 just because I hate how hard it is to host a game sometimes lol. might just be my friends being idiots tho....

Hey, anyone reading this, don't forget to have a good day, alright?!"
29927,"This Game Is Fantastic. People Dislike It For The Fact Its 2D But After A While Of Playing, Its Just normal. The Random Gen Seeds Are Great And The Multiple Classes Make The Game Super Fun To Replay. A Great Variety Of Weapons,Armour And Enemies. 10/10

And you can explore lot of the different biomes to find good loot from chests or enemies. I like the diffrent bosses and how the game progressed and changed everytime you defeated a boss.
It's has lots of replay value imo."
29954,"I liked the part where I played the game, it was good
Jokes aside, it's definitely not 2D Minecraft. It may have similarities but they're not the same game.

29998,"One of the few games that actually stayed true to what they always were. No DRM, no BS, just pure gameplay and fun. In many aspects, the game overdelivered (which I see as a very good thing), so it's packed with countless features for people of any age to enjoy.

Thank you Re-Logic, for staying true to the legendary name of actual gaming (that is slowly being wiped off the planet due to corporatization and greed, sadly)."
