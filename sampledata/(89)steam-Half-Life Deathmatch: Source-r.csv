0,"Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is the Source engine port of the multiplayer portion of Half-Life.

At the time of this review, I only found one populated server, and it only had 4 other players. Obviously, this is old now, but I'm not sure why anyone would have wanted to play it over the other multiplayer Source or even GoldSrc mods. Well, the all time peak concurrent player count was 79, so I guess that speaks for itself. 

As with Half-Life: Source, it includes no new assets or textures, but adds new physics, lighting, and water effects. Unfortunately, it also includes new bugs!

Most people only have this in their library due to it being bundled with other Half-Life games, or the Valve Complete Pack."

14,I think I can Find My cumsock Age Better Then Play This game.
15,"Second and last Valve's lamentable experiment taking a game that has been made on GoldSrc engine and turn everything into Source engine.

It is easy to guess that it's as buggy as Half-life: Source. If you want to play a deathmatch in Half-life world - better pick ""Half-life 2: Deatchmatch"" - there's more features and much less bugs"
16,"A game that was broken. Everything was fine before «SteamPipe».
In 2007 I played this game without bugs. Everything worked. Items weren't duplicated and hitboxes worked correctly.
RIP"
17,Half-Life deathmatch but bad
18,"Gierka spoko, ale w 2022 na 15min max. Ale jest w zestawie z HL: Source więc polecam"
19,"Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is a paid Valve multiplayer PvP shooter game that is using the original retro graphic textures, maps and models from the original Half Life game, and running on the Source engine.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.

When i tried it around review time, i found a few servers with good ping and there was people playing on those servers, i jumped into an empty server and it didn't take long for someone to arrive to wreck my testing by killing me.  Some maps are similar to quake style maps.  The graphic style is quite retro.  The player base is very small.  Some people will not like this game for various reasons.

Maybe only get this in the Half Life or Valve bundle and load it if you like PvP shooter games and the Half Life theme.  Check to see if you already have this game after buying the Half Life 2 bundle or games.  Alternate to this is the Half Life 2 Deathmatch."
20,fuck you
21,"I do not care for this game at all. It is supposed to be just you running around a server and killing other players with no other objective in mind. You can do the exact same thing but more fun in gmod and gmod offers more to do than just that.

That may have been what it started out as, but no there is no one playing it at all. I got this game in a bundle and just wanted to see what it was and there was quite literally about 5 people in servers total. I joined one with one other person and it was just us running around killing each other for 8 minutes before I got bored enough to quit. Again, you could do this in gmod and there would be actual people to play with."
22,I think the original is better.
23,I hate this game
24,Couldn't find any active servers. I imagine it's mostly just for friends to play together now.
25,brother fix the playermodel changer i literal have to use the console
26,"It had potential. It really, really did. But the playerbase is really small, meaning its really hard to find genuine servers. But even when you do, everyone either uses cheap fucking tactics to get kills or is too good to let anyone else win or everyone is just fucking like ""SCREW YOU BITCH! YOU KILLED ME ONCE! NOW I TARGET YOU WHOLE GAME!"" and EVERYONE just fucking locks onto whoever they see.

Fuck the playerbase/10"

84,"Due to Steampipe and the fact that this game does not support the current version of Source, this game is completely broken. Players don't ragdoll when they die properly. Certain map assets are duplicated, breaking them. The skyboxes can sometimes break. Just play normal Half-Life multiplayer in the original GoldSrc version."
85,"You must be very yung if you haven't play Half Life ever. But I don't want to spoil it to you so Imma say you buy this and enjoy it cause it can't be otherwise, a truly masterpiece definitely recommend it."

87,shit game
88,nice game you can pew pew and stuf like that
89,Super!
90,"You get it as a bonus in the bundles that include Half Life, and I'd say it's worth a download if you got a friend. There are a lot of pros who know how to abuse the mines and it becomes really annoying but if you got a friend and you're playing either 1v1 or against strangers it is a lot of fun. The damage can get annoying, sometimes it feels like you're doing no damage, and other times you get oneshot from nowhere. But there's basically no respawn time so it doesn't matter that much (unless you're playing only with strangers as i said, then it just gets boring). Usually you can join a server with maybe 1-3 players and more people eventually join. And if you, once again, got a friend, you can join a server with 0 people and have it grow. So yeah there's still people playing it. It's good ol deathmatch from the 90's, why would you not give it a go?"

104,"That... is a 7/10.

Now, as you can probably imagine this game is completely dead by now. But I will never stop loving the old Half-Life aesthetic, nor the SFX.

Plus if you and your friends are fans of the series, could be a fun little gaming sesh. Or if you're like me, sit in a server on your own long enough until somebody takes pity and joins you. I'll never forget you busud <3"

* Comes bundled with... something idk (HL1? The Orange Box?)
* [b]Gives you Half-Life: Source NPCs and weapons (not maps tho) for Garry's Mod, so you don't have to buy that dumpster fire of a ""remaster""[/b]
Disadvantages:
* It sucks
* If you really like HL1 Deathmatch you can play it in the original
* The ragdolls (Deathmatch Source's only feature) does not work
* Nobody plays this and nobody should play this

If you want to search for a server, there will be only one with another five dudes. The other servers have no players neither bots. Oh, and plus: there is no option to add bots, so if you want to play wandering alone around the map this game is for you. If you want to play better games, save money from buying this shit."

This bug affects almost all included maps, and it makes the game pretty much unplayable. However, there are some community-made maps that aren't affected by the bug.

I have not had many technical issues with Half-Life: Deathmatch Source's multiplayer at all.

Also the fact that VALVe officially supports mods and modding tools is a plus I love playing so much on custom brand new maps.

If you enjoy classic old multiplayer video games FPS and are getting bored or very annoyed at most multiplayer FPS video games of today, being released full of microtransactions and locking DLC characters or operators behind real money and are looking to mod a video game with new characters than Half-Life's multiplayer and Half-Life: Deathmatch Source's multiplayer is for you.

I can play thousands of hours and thousands of hours of Half-Life's multiplayer and Half-Life: Deathmatch Source's multiplayer, where as I do not even play ten hours a week of video games like Battlefield 4 or Battlefield 2042."

185,"his game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
186,its ok but id rather get half life source weapons and stuff in gmod and do the deathmatch there than in here
187,ow this bullshit is broken better play half life source singleplayer

197,"It's basically Half-Life, but in Free-for-all form. All the weapons from Half-Life are in here.

This game is DEAD though. So if you can host a private server and get a couple of your friends to play, then this game is awesome!

Great for fans of the original Half-Life. Not so good for people who just wanna play. There are much more people playing the original Half-Life Deathmatch and not the Source ""remake"" version. Just don't expect to find anyone playing on a Public server."

crashes alot though"

Based on the information provided, can you guess what game this review is for? What's it about? What kind of game is it?

Point is, these reviews are completely interchangeable. I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.

In my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.

Anyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?"
200,"One of first videogames in my life was multiplayer of Half-Life back in 2000s. Back then Counter-Strike was already very popular but I will never forget all the fun Half-Life gave to me and it was especially the map ""Crossfire"", which most of us loved the most. It's impossible to imagine the history of first-person shooters without Half-Life."

214,"Overall the main base gameplay is quake but instead with Half-Life weapons, models, etc. The gameplay is just like quake, nothing else to say here man."
215,"Old school game. The community is small but still it manages to keep up somehow. If you want to play in Europian timezone try the evening, There are a lot of community made maps like crossfire_deluxed or crossfire2017 that are fun to play. Overall positive."

217,"Actually fun multiplayer of ""that one half life game"""
218,"Unfortunately this's a near-completely-dead game. At the time of my playing it, there were only 15 servers available and 5 players playing in one. If you plan on playing it, make sure to bring along friends that also own it. Regardless I cannot recommend spending $10 on this, even on sale.

It's a better decision to pick up Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, since that has more servers and more players in them."
219,needs more players
220,Fun with friends
221,Here. Nobody here. Always alone.
222,NEED FIX
223,haha no
224,Used to find servers for this but now its unplayable since it has no SIngleplayer. That is the reason I wouldn't recommend it now.
225,i think i did have this game but somehow it got remove
226,"The multiplayer version of ""that one"" Half-Life game."
227,nice
228,.
229,it kinda shit
230,"Well... I just bought this for GMOD.
But I had quite a bit of fun on it too, good game."
231,Good Beans!
232,Why was I given this?
233,"Eh, broken game like and a normal HL1 Source. Buy it only for a Garry's Mod content."
234,"Not gonna lie, it's kinda fun"
235,"why do i own this
also its worse than hl source because everything is duplicated
i don't remember purchasing this or paying for it"
236,the only good half life source.
237,"I got this for 5$ not expecting much, more fun than it has a right to be"
238,"This game is.... something else.
This game changed my life. I'm an E-Sports Professional, who usually stream Half-life Deathmatch: Source. This game made me a multi-billionaire. Thank you, Valve, for everything you've done for me by producing Half Life Deathmatch: Source.
I'm happily married at the age of 27, with 3 happy children.
I've retired from real life jobs because of how amazing this game is.
I'm very excited to see Half Life Deathmatch: Source 2."
239,gud
240,"got it with half life 2 ep 1 i think?

game is broken, just like source. only really worth checking out if you wanna screw around. maybe grab some friends, if they have it.

kinda just good for gmod now
"
241,Absolute classic FPS game.
242,"It's not really worth it, the goldsrc version is much better. I mean, if you wan't the ""enhanced"" graphics i guess you could get this game, but, in general it's just bland. Just buy the original Half-Life(or deathmatch classic)."
243,trash af and the only servers are hosted on the other side of the world
244,"play the multiplayer in the og half life 1 instead. less janky, more people."
245,go play with your discord cringe i mean friends its really fun game
246,"Similarly to Half-Life: Source, Deathmatch: Source is just Half-Life Deathmatch thrown into the Source engine with no real optimization which provides a not-so-fun and buggy experience of play. If you take the time to set up the mods/optimize the game yourself, it can be an enjoyable experience, but I feel like the review has to be on merit for the game you are downloading and not what could be.

The good news is that Garry's Mod is really where all this Half-Life PvP modes live on and succeed! So definitely head towards Garry's Mod if you are looking for this experience again."
247,better than half-life source
248,Game is genuinely broken but it makes the game a lot more fun imo. It adds the right amount of choas to deathmatch.
249,I recommend this game because one of the servers is called Large Salami Hour and I thought that was a pretty funny name
250,"laties and jantlemen we got im.
"
251,"A lot of fun because of the bugs. Servers mostly have about 6 or 2 players. So, put your pp in a trash can, take it out without cleaning it, and this is the game. No actually, it may look bad but it's still fun because of that. I'd rate it about 8/10"

268,tripwires
269,"so honestly this game is pretty good and fun, basically half life 1, but multiplayer death match, basically like hl2 deathmatch which you get from episode 1 of hl2.
HOWEVER, HOW TF DID I GET THIS GAME?????
its probably the same reason as hl2 deathmatch but still, how"
270,"meh, this game is okay i 2021. the lobbies are kind of dead."
271,same as half life original deathmatch but on source

275,"I know, I know there is no single player part in this game, but still it's Half-Life and that's more than enough for me. It just brings back good memories and yes I was running around alone collecting items for no good reason for 10-15 minutes. Of course I do prefer the original single player game from 1998."
276,Nice Half-Life multiplayer addon.
277,bad
278,there are no microwaves :(
279,good game
280,i got this game for free.

283,We do a lil'trolling
284,Enjoyable but not too many players.
285,not much playerbase and the best weapons basically just get camped
286,I dont regret having this masterpiece
287,"How to voicetrolling in this game (Nah its fun)
I changed my playermodel to scientist.

Then I joined the most populated server.

Then, I use soundpad with some hl scientist voice and said,
""NO I DON'T WANNA DIE!""
""Don't shoot, I'm with the science team!""
""STAPH!""
""DARGHH!""
""can i smell that perfume trough that hev suit..?""
""Don't be a fool!""

299,Where it all began.
300,"DO NOT BUY THIS

This is a complete shit fest of a ""remaster"" (they don't call this one it specifically, but they call HL1 Source one) I have absolutely no clue why but weapons do absolutely no damage. Shotguns take millions of shots to kill, rockets do barely any damage and the Gauss is such a broken piece of shit it seems like it was directly ported from GoldSrc with zero changes to make it work in the Source engine. (The wall banging doesn't even work with it 99% of the time and the WallGauss explosions are gone alongside the gauss beam reflection unless hitting brush entities) 

I have no fucking idea how one fucks up this bad, this is nothing like HL1DM in any way whatsoever. I just can't even imagine how something like this happens and gets released to be purchased. I don't know if HL1DM: Source has always been like this, but knowing how valve is I wouldn't be surprised. I can't seem to find anything about this online, so it must help to prove that this was a recent update of sorts that completely fucked everything over. But, I can't see something like a engine update completely fucking the damage up for all weapons. Just go buy HL1 and pwn shit on crossfire. (You get the entirety of the HL1 campaign and multiplayer/DM)"

311,"Absolutely devoid of interest. HL1 deathmatch was already quite bad in its time, porting it to a new engine does not improve things. At least HL2 deathmatch has furniture that you can throw around."
312,"The game has many errors, first of all, the game does not have a mass, the servers are almost empty. And the mechanics are terrible, the recoil of the guns is also pretty bad. I attribute the poor graphics quality to the year it was released, but it still has many shortcomings in many ways, I see it as a waste of time."

319,"So right off the bat you’re looking to buy a 23 year old game’s revitalized multiplayer added into Source 7 years later. I don’t understand why this game even exists in the first place when Half-Life itself has its own in-game multiplayer system? Also they made a Half-Life 2 Deathmatch so why was this created in the first place? I also thought this was bundled when you bought Half-Life but, apparently it's sold separately...my. God. Basically what I’m trying to say is why in the name of Baby Jesus would you honestly buy this game? It’s a 23 year old game slightly enhanced onto a new engine 7 years later and then sold separately. No one plays this besides about 10 people or less on average. It’s never peaked at more than 100 players at a given time and on it’s best day gets about 30 people online. Seriously though out of all the current multiplayer games that exist you want to play this one? Come on. 

+Various maps and gamemodes
+For some odd reason people do still play it
+Lots of custom maps and custom servers
+In Source engine making it feel a lot like Half Life 2 but with Half Life 1 items 
+Several servers have bots if there’s no one else online
+Tons of item pick ups amongst the map

-Existing 
-dead af
-$10 for a 23 year old game’s multiplayer ported onto a new engine sold for $10 7 years later lol and it’s dead af 
-Several servers are super laggy and studer like you’re at 10 FPS
-Some servers have tons of custom assets making for 5+ minute load times only to end up joining a server with 2 people in it. 
-Any server with bots they either avoid you and rarely shoot at you or aimbot the shit out of you
-The rare odd questionable few who do still play this game have thousands upon thousands of hours and long jumps and no scope around every corner and are just absolute tryhards making it pretty fun when they’re the only people playing in the entire game.

Just no. no. why. I don’t even remember when or why I got this thought that it just came with the original Half-Life only to find out that it already has its own multiplayer in the game itself. Idk why this exists or even better why people still play it. Yes because somehow a 23 year old ported game’s multiplayer is more fun than any of the recently released FPS games within the last few years. Honestly wtf. Ew. 

"
320,"Games fun

For everyone that's saying ""How did I get this"" I'm pretty sure that it comes with Half Life 2: Episode 1
Edit: That's Half Life 2: Deathmatch I don't understand why I have this still"
321,"I love this game! It's free if you get Half-Life 2 Episode 1 Too bad there not many servers, I love the long jump technique, Ctrl +Jump btw, if you want to feel nostalgia, this is the game you play, but the bugs, oh no... 
1. Door doubling, Item Doubling, and Window Doubling, etc... [i forgot] all of those glitches affect Half-Life: Deathmatch Source. It affects players [making more players quit] like those. But all, Half-Life: Deathmatch Source is a great game, player's will come back if they patch the game."

This game is DEAD though. So if you can host a private server and get a couple of your friends to play, then this game is awesome!

Great for fans of the original Half-Life. Not so good for people who just wanna play. There are much more people playing the original Half-Life Deathmatch and not the Source ""remake"" version. Just don't expect to find anyone playing on a Public server."

Lots of things were broken in the Steampipe update (note: I was not around at that time, this is what other people say) like the playermodel selecting.

344,people have an insane amount of health in this game. Takes like 8 shotgun blast to kill someone and only explosives deal meaningful amounts of dmg. The deathmatch multiplayer that comes with hl or black mesa is better than this
345,Good game but no active players
346,"This game is over 3.4 GB, because it is about 85% Half-Life 2. They could have use the Half-Life 2 content in the Half-Life 2 game folder 📂 instead of making an unnecessary duplicate of Half-Life 2, and store it in the game itself that other games would not use, but this one."
347,i went into the menu screen best game -Yanderedev
348,"Basically just Half-Life Deathmatch but in Source, and also with a lot of HL:S's glitches and strange visual oddities. Although it looks slightly better, and has ragdolls, I'd say to just stick with classic GoldSrc Half-Life's deathmatch as although these are neat improvements, the better lighting and water effects just kinda've clash with the artstyle HL1 has going for it. If you really want to play HL Deathmatch but with better graphics then just go with Black Mesa. Also like HL2: Deathmatch, I have no idea why they made Deathmatch a seperate game when in the original HL1 it was built into the main game. At least Deathmatch Source comes with HL:S for free so I can't really complain there."

"
457,one of the best games to play in 2020
458,"Half-Life Deathmatch: Source SUCKS

why?

well were are
10 REASONS (and an extra) ON WHY YOU SHOULDN'T BUY THIS GAME:
1. buggy
2. weapons don't behave like in the original (for the worse)
3. extra disc space waste
4. bad framerate
5. inconsistent sound effects
6. inconsistent hitboxes 
7. buying this just for gmod isn't worth it
8. constant lag
9. the original DM works better in general, and it is more stable. plus it comes with the campaign
10. the soul reason: the multiplayer is mostly dead

EXTRA: the game looks awful, BECAUSE it just doesn´t feel right. Half life 1 has in my opinion a timeless artstyle but this game grabs the old textures and outdated models and better, yet, not truly realistic shaders mixing them into something that makes me want to puke. It just doesn't feel right

CONCLUSION: this game is an absolute piece of shit, don't bother even looking at it, you are better putting your hand into a blender."

467,is good game and fun to play with friends
468,Nope.. just no
469,idc this game have only one active server its like half life original deathmatch just... why

471,"Man, this game  f u c k i n g   s u c k s. Why? Valve just thought:""s h i t, let's just make Steampipe patch for all our Source games but we not gonna test anything, not gonna test compatibility and stuff. Players will test"". I tested. Half-Life Deathmatch: Source treats players like garbage while being garbage itself.

You think you can use tau cannon in a same way you've been using it for all these years in Hl1 deathmatch? No, game says:""sorry, man, 98% of surfaces will damage you hard if you'll try to use gauss on them"". Wanna use tau to get on the roof? You'll get 1000 damage. Wanna shoot enemy through wall? Wall gonna turn you into gibs. Not like in hl1, where there were like 3 or 4 walls damagin' you. Too easy! Let's turn it into a lottery, where 9 walls out of 10 will kick your  a s s  if you shoot them. B u l l s h i t.

Mp5 nade now has damage radius of nuclear bomb. You see explosion of the nade on the other side of the map - next second your dead body rotating 360 degrees in the  f u c k i n g  air.

Hitboxes have turned into complete  s h i t s h o w. Sometimes you make double-barrel shot from Spas12 while enemy is 1 meter away but somehow he survives and, what's is even better, doesn't take any damage! Wonderful, right? And sometimes you get hit by shotgun from kilometer range (and you have 100 health and 100 armor) and die instantly. ""Kiss my  a s s! No fair play here!"" - said HLDM:S.

Xbow is the worst weapon in the universe now because if you made a shot from it when you were 25 years old, the bolt will hit target once you are 95. Also xbow has dumb camera shaking after each shot, which is very annoying when you are in zoom mode. Epilepsy warning!

Crowbar can't hit  s h i t when you hitting a moving enemy while also moving your character. You hear hit sounds but surprise - no damage dealt! Game just laughs at your pathetic attempts to kill someone with melee weapon.

Unless you playing on a server with a custom .cfg you will encounter all of this  s h i t (and even more). It's not a very good thing when to actually play the game you have to join custom servers or change a lot of stuff in cfg of yours. Oh, and also to change playermodel, you have to bind the model you want in console. You need to do it EVERY time you launch game. F u c k i n g  menu doesn't work when you try to change model in it. So most of the time you'll see gordons running around trying to have fun in this trash game."
472,Fun game.
473,Pity nobody plays it these days

It didnt gave me any nostalgia because  i didnt knew a game like this existed at the time.

It can be played with friends, it had some issues around 2013 just like how all the hl games did because of valve changing their rules.

I dont really like it, i didnt play it that much but i'll give it a 7/10 for now.

496,"I didn't recommend Half-Life: Source and I definitely won't be recommending its multiplayer counterpart either. This game (which strangely came out two years after the Source port for the single player aspect) is like a prototype for Half-Life 2 Deathmatch. After the disaster of Half-Life: Source it's mind-boggling to think why Valve were so keen to release a multiplayer add-on. Despite the improvements of the Source engine over time - see Half-Life 2 Episode One, which came out around the same time - this game still feels wonky and a bit broken like the main game. The servers seem to all have bad latency no matter what, the rag-dolls are stiff and somewhat petrified-looking... and just to remind you that Valve don't give two turds about this game, you can't switch player model skins without tampering around in the developer console. Nice.  
So, will I recommend this game? Absolutely not. Even if you aren't a fan of Goldsource games, at least they're more heavily populated and (sort of) receive a little bit more acknowledgement from their creators. The original Half-Life is still a far superior experience. 
Half-Life Deathmatch: Source has no good reason to exist. It really is just another generic shooter that Valve threw together simply because they could. And, not that I hold it in much of a high regard, Half-Life 2 Deathmatch is the way to go for a ""real"" Half-Life multiplayer game.
It also doesn't have weapons that look as though they've been licked clean and polished for about forty years. So there's that, too."
497,"There is no reason this game should be 3GB or a separate purchase to Half-Life: Source. Unless you want to use the models in Garry's Mod, buy the original Half-Life."
498,all i can say is gg

If I could trap time in a bottle, the first thing that I'd like to do, is save every day in an eternity and then spend it all with this game, and the friends whom I play it with. Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is the best game of all time. There is simply no question. It is the penultimate FPS experience."

518,"Oh boy this was a bit hard because I like old half life PvP combat but i digress. This game is just a better version of Half Life Deathmatch from... Half Life so if you own the og HL game theres no need of playing this one. Second well this place is kinda deserted so yea theres like 1 server I joined for a while because it actually had players. But we gotta move to other things, I got this game in the Orange Box and I only played it to talk about this one for a vid i made in my channel and after that just wanted to see it myself in a normal ""just for fun enviroment"" I actually enjoyed it but realised later on, this game hasn't aged well and its in the source engine, it just looks to glossier, the weapons dont look good, their textures are like mirrors and has some of the issues from the release of Half Life Source"

530,"[h1] Half-Life Deathmatch: Source [/h1]

[b] A Dead Game That Had No Fun Times To Be Had [/b]

I tried this title out hoping it would be as fun as [b] Half-Life 2: Deathmatch [/b], but I was sorely mistaken. There was really only one somewhat active server, and it only had less than five players. The shooting felt poor (attributed to Half-Life: Source itself), and the hit detection was extremely spotty. Nothing remarkable can really be said about this game, other than that its really old, really unpopulated, and really bad.

This game is DEAD though. So if you can host a private server and get a couple of your friends to play, then this game is awesome!

Great for fans of the original Half-Life. Not so good for people who just wanna play. There are much more people playing the original Half-Life Deathmatch and not the Source ""remake"" version. Just don't expect to find anyone playing on a Public server.

This goes for Half Life source too. If you've never played the original Half Life, don't make the mistake of playing that game first, it's buggy and an inferior version to the original Half Life game. In conclusion, the source ports are dreadful, not worth it."

Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is a game developed and published by Valve

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Half-Life Deathmath: Source overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good action game and to play in short bursts

562,"The classic free-for-all. Forget TEAMS and CO-OPERATION! I mean, who even wants to play TFC right? Do they have Gauss Guns? NO! Not really, anyway.

All jokes aside, it feels pretty goofy-fun to crossbow the G-Man in the back of the head in a deathmatch setting. Taking heavily story-set characters, weapons and maps out of the  linear structure of a Half-Life game and dumping them into a bloodthirsty fragfest arena is still refreshing, despite how outdated this game is in 2020. Last I played, there were still a few weirdos fragging about on some servers somewhere. I had really high ping though LOL. 

To those who stayed, I salute you."
563,VERY well made is fun to play with friends (espicially when you tick off kids and make them rage quit) good controls and it's built off of a good game anyway so 9/10 the only problem is it's hard to setup a server for your friends
564,It's one of those dead games.Save yourself the money and go buy a large burger instead.
565,"shit game, used to be good until it was broken by updates."
566,"I'm honestly surprised that there isn't a huge community for this game. I mean, sure, there's the Steam Community Page for it, but that's kind of all I've found. This is overall a really fun game, even with the outdated physics of Golden Source.

There is a bit of a hacking problem that I've noticed on a couple of servers, and it does kind of decrease the fun of it a little bit.

Another thing is the price. Now, I've bought this game as part of Orange Box, and I've been playing it for a while on public servers. Sure, public servers are fun, but it's not really as fun as playing with some good friends. Most of my friends don't use Steam that often, and they don't really want to put money into it until they've played something fun for free just to try out. I understand that this will probably never happen anytime soon, but I would really like it if this game is free, or at least cheaper."

611,"To be honest I enjoyed playing it but it is mainly for the nostalgia.

Older game so old graphics but playable.

Have not had any bugs but lag seems to be an issue.  

It is a fun deathmatch game and has some interesting maps and weapons it even has some of the first environmental effects on its maps like in Battlefield for example on one map you can start a bomb strike and anyone not in a bunker will die.

It is an old game and from my experience there is not a lot of players anymore there does seem to always be at least 3 servers running and at least one server with a decent amount of people playing but server lag can occur at times which is annoying,

I would recommend as part as a bundle."
612,addicted
613,It's fun for a little while like any other old deathmatch game. I don't know how it appeared in my Steam library either.
614,I actually enjoy playing this! 10/10
615,"Great game with phenomenal fast-paced shooting. 

I've bought it for a number of friends for the full-price & it's mega worth it. 

I've played only eight hours in the past year, but I wish I played more. Servers are empty, but usually there's at least one dude playing. If I get two friends & I into a server then the player count usually doubles with random people entering and leaving. If you're interested in this or already play it, feel free to add me. I'm down to hop into this and if it's the right time I can get a couple pals in too. 

Modded servers are great too, lots of map variety, but even the vanilla maps have fun designs. Really refreshing to play DM like this in 2021."
616,PLEASE bring this game back from the dead its so much fun but its neglected by retards who think playing with a gravity gun is soooooo coooool
617,Old but gold
618,pretty cool
619,This is just a pvp version of of Half Life 1 combat but with the source engine. Community is dead and anyone dedicated enough to play is probably a hacker or making a youtube video about it. It might be worth it to play with a bunch of friends but there are better games for that sort of thing. Still good because Half Life is good.
620,dead game
621,"Bring back so many memories from our LAN days. Great game and easy to play. Wish there were more people playing, had so much fun recently when we were 12 players in Bounce."
622,i did not have the time to play it for free while alyx was in development :(
623,yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah not that good.
624,classic even when its literal crap

629,Old but gold.
630,Great game
631,"This is just normal Half-Life Deathmatch ported to Source. It's here, but there's not much too it. Most people are probably more familiar with the old version. This is only worth it as part of a bundle."
632,ye
633,Cool. Has no deathmatch classic gamemodes and crashes frequently but other than that cool
634,Nice game but dead game. Nice to play with 5 players or just bots.
635,"Theres a crack on my screen because of this game

Fix satchel charges"
636,"This game is quite fun but it's extremely glitchy. The long jump didn't even function, I walked on water, when I held Shift I walked and when I let go of it I started sprinting, I couldn't change my character and sometimes I would randomly take a few steps back without touching my keyboard even once. No, the game is not dead. You will see people on servers every now and then. Sure, they aren't choke-full, but they aren't abandoned either, however, that's not the problem. The problem are glitches that make the game unplayable."
637,Just play Half-Life 2: Deathmatch.
638,Awesome game!
639,Nothing else to say about half life game
640,Good for boring times when you just want to play Half - Life but you have already played trough it
641,i spam the nukes on crossfire
642,"In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#312 out of 612)... it's time for Half Life Deathmatch: Source.

Basically just the multiplayer mode of the original Half Life game, remade in Half Life 2's source engine. I'm not convinced it has much appeal beyond nostalgia, but if that's the itch you've got, it'll scratch it. Sadly I possess no such fond memories--my recollection of the original Half Life is almost exclusively with the fantastic single player mode."

Maybe to play for an hour,or two.Play with the old graphics,and use the classic old weapons.
But that's about it.
The problem is simple.The game is an antique at this point,and it has very few players.
Mostly dead.
If you got the game for free with a package.Try it if you like.
But it's not worth buying at this point.
"
656,Free is good.
657,"this game is good. I even got an idea for a ""cosplay gamemode"" we could play in HL Death match! or, Half Death, as i like to call it. Zombies mode! it reqires no mods and revolves around skins: hl1 grunt vs zombies. zombies can only use crowbar, snarks, and explosive satual. zombie leader gets to use hive hand and lazer mine. humans only use mashine gun, grenades, lazer mines, rocket launcher, and gause gun. if a zombie kills a human, they are forced to change skin to zombie. oh, AND human leader has to have hev suit skin. die an elite, stay an elite! play this gamemode!!!"
658,Pathetic gameplay experience
659,great addition to half life but its mostly dead idk why it even exists.
660,AMAZING GAME
661,best game ever

Shame there's no collector's edition though.

663,I can't really recommend anyone play this game when there's the newer version is out and on this one there doesn't seem to be any players
664,good game
665,This game is very niiicce 10/10 IGN more people need to play
666,"This is just the multiplayer component of Half-Life, remastered in the Source engine. That's all. It's extremely fun, but there are some flaws. 1: There's only a few servers at a time that actually have people playing on them. 2: The game has a very minor crashing issue."
667,good game i will remember this game
668,Fucking fantastic fun and absolute mayhem. Would absolutely recommend.

670,i can have sëx with scientist omg
671,"While I really love the nostalgia of this gem:
I just can't give this game a positive review.
This used to be a revolution, not anymore.
It's basically a dead game for your library.
You won't play it, since nobody is online.
Maybe with a friend or something, sure.
But there are better deathmatch games.
This was a great game, but now it's not.
You can just buy this for your collection.
Just look at the reviews, those playtimes.
Those positive reviews are just nostalgic.
I would like to give this a neutral review.
But steam does not do neutral reviews."
672,Just play og hl1 multiplayer this game is completely dead

674,"Half Life in itself had a lot of death match-esque traits and features that would have made a great & fun deathmatch game, which it did at least in it's prime. Now that the player base has practically dwindled into a very low - non-existent player base as much as it is a fun game, and unless you like playing with bots, it is not fun without anyone to play with since it's in the name ""deathmatch"". With no players, it's as good as watching paint dry. It's a good game, ran out of life support."

685,"good but needs a workshop

686,yes
687,"It's kind of enjoyable. Even though I usually don't play deathmatch games, it has so much of the Half-Life vibe to it that it kept me entertained for a while."
688,You can shoot people in it
689,good game guys
690,"I was going to leave a negative review because I remember playing this game for the first time finding it completely dead.

But once I found an active server, I had the time of my life. Sure, there's probably better and more fun ways to play Half Life multiplayer, but I still had a great time. I love the weapon variety, the fast paced movement, the non-existent respawn times, and the salty adults who get mad if you treat the game childishly. It's fun!"
691,It would be a lot more fun if it wasn't dead.
692,"[i]Half-Life Deathmatch: Source[/i] provides some slight entertainment, but is overall a victim of modern enhancement.

This was probably a solid title upon its initial release, providing players with endless hours of fun, but now it is something completely different. The age on this title shows, whether you're considering the lack of modern incentives for deathmatch games or the almost completely dead player base, it just can't compete with most modern titles. The base gameplay from [i]Half-Life[/i] is present, which is stellar when applied to the game it was made for, but it isn't anything special in this format, at least nowadays. The fun to be had here wears thin, I'm not sure whether this is due to growing up with much more complex online multiplayer or it is a weak format for a deathmatch in general, but before I even complete a match, I'm often left bored and it just makes me want to play the original [i]Half-Life[/i] instead. Every time I have attempted to play the game, only one map is available to play on because really nobody else is on any other server, so you're strictly limited to that single arena, which I'm assuming is the most popular, but it isn't nearly good enough to warrant hours of gameplay. 

In my review of [i]Half-Life: Source[/i], I have elaborated on how useless the graphical upgrade has been as a replacement for the original game's textures, as it takes away a lot of the stylized charm and does little to improve what is already there. The game is completely playable in its original state, and already includes the original deathmatch servers in the game itself, therefore buying this bundle is useless even if you wanted to try it out, as [i]Half-Life[/i] already comes with the full package. Really, the problems I have with the [i]Source[/i] version of the original are ones I have with the [i]Source[/i] version of the deathmatch title, even more so due to its sheer uselessness. 

One would likely enjoy this deathmatch title over a decade ago, but nowadays, you'd be much better off with a modern title, or at least a classic that has substance and a living player base. [i]Half-Life Deathmatch: Source[/i] gets old fast, and is once again a more negative than positive experience out to take your money. Unless you hold some sort of nostalgia or are an avid fan of this title, do not waste your money on the [i]Source[/i] version of [i]Half-Life: Source[/i] and [i]Half-Life Deathmatch: Source[/i], just purchase the original and enjoy it in its originally intended way if you are going to play the deathmatch at all.

701,good game
702,"I got surprisingly addicted to this game for a good while after I got this with Half-Life 1. From what I can say, this game offered some really good fun for my 10.5 hours of playtime thanks to it's well made maps and the use of the Half-Life 1 weapons, tools and mechanics which are well put into the deathmatch scenario of the game. In all honestly though, it isn't that unique compared to the newer online FPS games that can look, play and feel better, but this game has a very certain nostalgic feeling towards it that makes it special and this is coming from someone who has no nostalgic connection to half-life 1 at all but the really early 3-D graphics and well structured maps as mentioned before gave me a certain feeling that is almost impossible to recreate without the use of something old like this game.

It is quite a good game especially something running on the source engine but I would, without a doubt say get this on sale. I understand that sentence contradicts the positives I have mentioned about this product but a severe problem is that not many people play this game no more and a lot of the servers are empty, though you will occasionally find a map with a few actual players on and not just the somewhat terrible bots but the amount of money it is selling for now will deliver a pretty good deathmatch game using Half-Life 1 and the source engine but proceeds to lack what it needs most, that being actual players playing.

If you want this game, get it with Half Life 1 or the entire series if you can, get this game if you have some money you really do not have anything else to spend it on after all there are worse ways to over spend your money on something, get this game if you have a couple of friends that are also willing to get the game and see if you can all get into a server together if its possible or just get this game on sale as I have mentioned before.

703,This was a great game at one time. It's hard to find a populated server anymore though...
704,good

712,its really fun to play no matter who your playing with and i like the maps gun etc.
713,"Like Half-Life Source, the game has a ton of bugs. However, the gameplay is still solid. Also, there is usually around ten people online so finding a match isn't a huge problem. Overall, the game is a fun time."
714,it's kinda joe
715,Just a bad refurbished copy of the original. Don't waste time or money on this. Thank you.

This version is more borked and broken than Half Life: Source, and that's the main reason it's practically dead. There aren't any players who dare want to taste this sauce.

Go play deathmatch in the original version instead, [b]and learn to never take the gold from goldsauce bruh.[/b]

Really old school, only one map, no match length, so your just dropped into one map and kill the same 2 or 3 people over and over again if your lucky enough to have that many people online at the same time. Dont bother with this one."
733,"Although it might have been amazing once, it's just like the main Half-life: Source. Full of bugs. The goldsrc version at least has a playerbase. You recieve this for free if you buy Half-life 2: episode one anyways so I don't really care."

755,Nyaaa~~
756,"----- PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING THIS! -----

This failed game should've been out of store for many years  is no longer functioning and should not be bought. in 2013 this game was entirely ruined with steampipe update. Before I go on, let me define the word ""ruined"" as it's used in this context. By ""ruined"" I mean that this game is so properly glitched that you cannot even change your player model anymore! Yeah, that should give you an idea of how much Valve cares for their games.


So yeah, rather buy the normal HL because not only do you get the singleplayer portion of the game with the multiplayer, the online play is still functioning like it should and there is at least a player base. Oh, and if you are planning to buy Half-Life Source which is the other half of this, then don't. It might not be equally broken, but broken enough to make you mad.

Or just get Black Mesa, then you will at least get something that is prettier on the eyes and functioning like it should."
757,"Still fun. Very, very fun.

10/10, would murder friends again"
758,like i guess
759,It's exactly what it says on the tin.  Half-Life has a multi-player mode in the Source engine.  Nothing exciting.
760,"Why is this game 2,5gb more than the original?

Its fun tho"
761,its half life... of course its good
762,Game has died in player base
763,I love sorse :)
764,There is not much to say. It is a deathmatch. A half life deathmach. Online. Just a fun little addition.

2.Better than COD
3.Cheap!
4.Fun gameplay with a large assortment of weapons

CONS:

I highly recomand original,NOT this version..."

It may not have a ton of players, but what is there can be a blast. Half Life's masterfully designed gunplay fits perfectly into this chaotic pvp environment. Just messing around with the large pool of weapons is all you really need to have a good time in this game."

790,its find for a fun fuck around
791,good add on
792,"Play as your favorite Gordon Freeman

PROS: The game controls just as smoothly as the original Half-Life.  Everything that was good about the gun feel and gameplay is right here.

CONS: It's just an online shooter, really lacking any of the polish or finesse that the other games spawned off this engine grew into.  There's also a bit of a shortage of content compared to them as well.  Last...let's not mince words, the game is mostly dead at this point.

FINAL: Nothing really to say beyond the short description.  Maybe if I got into this ages ago, I could really dive deep.  But right now, not quite worth the time."
793,"It's deathmatch.... in SOURCE!  But seriously, it's a decent deathmatch game.  If that's up your alley, this might be a game you would like to play.  I recommend, but not really a must have game anymore :("

806,fun but crashes sometimes.
807,This game is so much better than Half-life 2: Deathmatch. This game is so much more funner and funny. Custom maps with secret entrances to better weapons. Really fun and could play for hours. Die a lot tho. Maybe add more health.

817,"it good, but dead a little bit. 8/10"
818,"funny story. a map got infested with bots saying things like ""do not forget the cake"" and like ""i don't blame you."" and most annoying they said it a lot and didn't say anything else. then the map just added redux to the name. and i never saw the bots again. than the map just never showed up for me ever since. yet still a great thing to buy."

857,"So far I got to  say, despite the game being practically dead because not alot of people plays it anymore, I am actually impressed on how fun and addictive it is. You run around pick up weapons and shoot everyone else, no teams , just every man for themselves. Half-Life's guns may be OP and on paper may sound not suitable for multiplayer but if you can just simply avoid, you can counter the OPness of the weapons. You need plenty of skill and cat-like reflexes to properly play the game, and an extensive knowledge of Half-Life and it's Weapons.

I recommend people who are highly competitive, have fast reaction times, and like to play classic games."

862,"[h1] Retro Review[/h1] 
Okay this one is rather weird. Im not really sure why i own this one as you usually get this when buying the source port of the game. And since its based on the source port, im not surprised its completely dead.

[u] Gameplay[/u] 
You start off in every map with a pistol(except on modded servers) which in itself is already a huge problem. In other arena shooters you often start with some kind of competeable weapon, like a shotgun as an example. Here if you meet anyone who picked up any other weapon before you because they spawned closer to one or you joined a server midfight you instantly lose.

Then there is the weapons itself who are balanced in a singleplayer game in mind. This means some weapons are just completely devastating compared to others. There is even a meme on the community hub that you get automaticly good and easy kills by just picking up the grenade launcher(some even call it assault rifle). The movement isnt fast enough to be able to dodge rockets or grenades. This is why quake or any other games with similiar speed are working so well, explosions do pack a punch but are easier to dodge.

HL Deathmatch Source is also one of the most dead multiplayer games of valve, right next to ricochet and team deathmatch classic. There is a handful of servers that are completely empty. You might be lucky to find someone playing. Most play the original GoldSrc engine multiplayer.

[u]Aesthetics [/u] 
I think the map design looks good but arent made for this type of gameplay. There are some base maps that have barely any sideways to go, and feel rather liniar in a circle. Some even are outright straight designed which means dodging people makes it harder because often ways people will go is very predicable.

Due to the source port some graphical changes are made, but biggest difference is the really high quality water which totally looks out of place compared to the old player models and environment textures.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR [/u] 
This multiplayer game seems definetly charming with its huge arsenal of weapons but just fall flat in every aspect that makes an arena shooter good. The movement is too slow to dodge projectiles and explosions, maps are nice looking but badly designed from a gameplay standpoint and there are no players to find anymore. If you want to use the crazy Half Life weaponry on other players, rather try the original games multiplayer part instead."
863,its fun
864,Doesn't really seem like it should be a game on its own.

889,"This is truly the greatest online shooter of all time. I remeber the first time I ever played this game, it was August of 2004 on a tuesday. My wife had just left me. After I had lost my job my wife said that she couldn't love a failure so she ran off to another state and took the children with her. I felt I needed an escape from the sheer pain of my situation. I thought that going to my local bar would help drown my sorrows. As I stepped into the building, the bar tender, Big John Joe ( I have no idea if that was his real name) noticed my dower state and asked how the situation was going. I told him it wasn't going well, that I didn't have enough money to sue for custody and that I was considering suicide. Worried, he told me of a way possibly make some quick cash. He told me about this game called Half-Life Deathmatch: Source. He said that with enough practice I could get good enough to win prize money from tournamets and maybe even get a sponsorship. So thats what I did, I played for months. Day in and day out, I would play Half-Life Deathmatch: Source until I got good enough to get into tournaments. I played fairly well, getting fourth place. I did even better during my next locals placing second and then eventually first. It was strange I had gotten fairly good so quickly, it was almost like Half-Life Deathmatch: Source and I were connected in some way. Anyway, I got sponsored by Sprite, their rep told me that ""I knew all the tricks."" With the sponsorship along with the tournament prize money, I was able to sue for custody and have a chance at getting my children back. It was long and painful court battle, but eventually I won. The victory was even more amazing than any game of Half-Life Deathmatch: Source. My children are now in college and I feel content both as a father and as a man. All because of one game, Half-Life Deathmatch: Source."
890,um its ok but kinda outdated. I suggest you play Black Mesa's Multiplayer instead.
891,EA sports it's in the gayme.
892,"Its not the best but its ok. Kinda like Sven Co-op. Its still a very fun shooter with good online servers that never crash. For an early game like this to not crash as much thats amazing! Tho it can get boring after a while and Half Life 2:Deathmatch has taken over this game. So I have to give it a 6.8/10. I still recommend it though,it is still fun!"
893,Half-Life 2 Deathmatch but with a 90s coat of paint. Only 90's kids will remember this.
894,"This has even more glitches than the singleplayer Half-Life:Source game and not many people really play this.
But you can still have a lot of fun with some friends in this game.


Just like in my review for Half-Life:Source I would recommend you to play the multiplayer in the original Half-Life though. It has less bugs and a lot more active players."
895,"Disclaimer: Playtime is not accurate as I have not played the game since Steam added the playtime tracker

No I don't recommend this game because Valve has proven themselves to be a joke of a company that only cares about milking every last penny they possibly can out of their customers.

Why else is the only game that Valve has managed to get out the door lately a ♥♥♥♥ing cash-grab trading card game?

You're better off waiting for the ORIGINAL Duke Nukem Forever to get completed and then made into it's own trilogy of ""episodes"" because at this point in time it's got a hell of a lot better chance of seeing the light of day than anything from Valve with a 3 on it aside from a ♥♥♥♥ing Artifact Booster Pack Expansion Set #32

The day after Episode 2 was finished, Gaben wheeled his desk back over to his favorite project at Valve....

There are only few players that playing the game.But there are bots of course.You can still play with them
But the game is still fun in some ways.This game's weapons are different than the normal Half-Life.Graphics are better.
My feelings for this game are really complicated.If you want to buy this game, wait for sale.I think you should give it a try."
897,Gameplay wasn't as good as normal Half-Life: Deathmatch. But it is still a great game.
898,"Okay game, i rather play tf2.

899,"Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is great.
But you need others to play with.

Graphics 10/10 (Classic Half-Life graphics.)
Maps 10/10 (Half-Life themed maps with different layouts, this means you will need slighty different tactics for every map.)
Bugs 10/10 (None.)

You can get this if you want, it is good.
But there is a lack of players due to the age of this game, it is your choice if you want to get it. I got it in the Half-Life collection.

(This is very much based on my HL2: Deathmatch review as i had the same experience. I could really tell what this would be like if people still played.)"

916,"This game is surprisingly alive in 2018. I had 2 different games within 3 hours that had anywhere from 2-7 players. This game lacks any semblence of balance in the weapons.

It's sort of like HLDM, but prettier, and seemed harder to hit things.

I had some fun, and at least 1 interesting conversation asking people why they were still playing this. Mostly seems like an old habit and a good time killer for people.

I wouldn't really recommend it, unless you want to play against mostly bots, or one strangely-good Russian player who will call you a noob everytime he crushes you at this rather old, mostly dead game. Still, it was better than I expected."

931,"Better than COD. Seriously, it actually is (in my opinion)."
932,"I haven't made a review in a while and for some reason, I wanted to talk about this game. Recently, I was going through my steam library trying to play games that I haven't played much of. I found HL:DMS and I was interested to see if I could find a match on this game. Turns out every now and again you will actually find matches. Which I found pretty crazy that people are still playing this. There's even a bot server you can play on if you can't find other players.

I don't want to write too much about this game like I did for my fallout review due to the nature of what it is. This game is a port of HL1's multiplayer into the Source engine. If you never played HL1's multiplayer, basically, you play on about 11 or so maps finding weapons around you and try to kill each other. That's it. Sounds very basic but it's actually a lot of fun to play. Especially if you just get a huge party of friends to just battle it out. Personally, I think this game and HL:S are great games but don't reach the magic of the original game.

 If you're curious about playing this, get it on sale. The Summer Sale is going on at the time I've posted this and you can pick the game up and HL:S for $0.99. Actually I think every HL game is on sale for that price so definitely go buy the whole series if you're interested. If you just want a classic HL or HL2 Multiplayer game with a consistent player count, either buy the original HL or HL2: Deathmatch. Otherwise, it's safe to pass on this title."
933,Half-Life deathmatch but the rocket launcher deals less damage than the pistol.

I've played it a few times, and I still have no clue what it's about in half of the maps. But I mean, as I'm new to the game, that's to be expected.
Some of the maps are really cozy and people aren't even really fighting, Guessing they're just taking a trip down memory lane.
I was hoping to make a normal review about this game, but in the state it is now that's pretty much impossible.
If this game for whatever weird reason takes off at some point of time, I might update this review then.
The gameplay feels like HL1, nothing odd about that. When you actually find a server with people playing in it, it's actually not hard to keep up if you're used to FPS games.
A very basic deathmatch game. Very basic.

Overall 3/10. A good deathmatch shooter for its time, I'm sure about that. However, by todays' standards, not a good game. That's why it isn't played."
943,"My summary in 4 sentences:
The game is very polished,as you would expect from a source version of a game.It is still being played.I personally had decent amount of fun for the few hours I played it.If you have friend that are willing to play it,you can get on an empty server and have even more fun."
944,"I wanted to make this review short and sweet, but it's hard to stop writing, even when excluding facts that could potentially contaminate an exceptionally well thought-out gaming experience. There's just so much to say. Half-Life 2 is, simply put, the best single-player shooter ever released for the PC. It does so many things right in so many ways that it might be possible to write a thesis on the topic of Half-Life 2 compared to other single player shooters. What Valve has created is simply a masterpiece -- a work of art in the genre. Not only does it engage the mind with mysterious happenings, vagaries, and mostly intelligent dialogue, but also captures the senses with a superb visual style made possible by brilliant technology. And once the initial shock of it all wears off and it becomes possible to peel back the polished layers of sight and sound, there is an excellent shooter here. Half-Life 2 doesn't do anything particularly new; it doesn't really innovate in many ways. But what it does is set a new height for all other designers of first-person shooters to reach. It still isn't exactly perfect, but it's about as close as I've seen in my tenure here.

Before I really get into the review, you should know the background of how this game was reviewed. Valve did not want to send out copies of their game (for fairly obvious reasons) before it was released to the public. In order to play the game, I, and several of my colleagues throughout the industry, took a trip up to Seattle to visit Valve in order to have some private time with the title. I was given a little room to myself where I could close the door, turn off the lights, click my little red slippers, and pretend that I was sitting at home. It worked for the most part, largely because I was so engrossed with the game that when I came out of my trance I often had to take a moment to get my bearings. Obviously, Valve was happy to bring me into a controlled environment for ideal playing conditions."

Somehow, I find [i]Half-Life: Source[/i] single-player and the original's multiplayer to be more appealing.

980,this game is experimental at best only buy it for garrys modification if ats yer ing
981,8/10
982,Boring. Also who plays Half-Life for the multiplayer?
983,"Though pretty much NO ONE plays it, Half Life Deathmatch: Source is still a lot of fun. You have access to all of the original weapons from Half-Life, you spawn in with other players, and BAM! Plus, Half-Life Deathmatch: Source comes free with every purchase of Half-Life 1. Now how about that! If you play by yourself, you’ll only find servers with 2-3 people playing. If you get a group of friends together and play, it won’t be so boring.

TOTAL SCORE:
7/10"

991,dead servers everywhere.

2. Uninstall this game
3. You have done playing it

[spoiler] It is just [b]3gbs file of junk[/b] with dead servers, terrible ping, bad map designs, horrible aim and hit detection, then came a rocket camper that keep spamming for easy kills while you are trying to comprehend what the f*ck is going on.

1000,This game is very awesome... it's only half life deathmatch but on source! How fun is that??
1001,"Great game, but I still prefer Half-Life: Blue Shift: Episode 4: Deathmatch: Source: Reloaded"
1002,Gameplay is outdated but playing around with servers with jump boosters fun.
1003,this game seems to be dead to the point where servers that accualy have players have an admin(owner) abusing his powers... its just not fun.
1004,"Pretty dead game, but still lots of fun!"
1005,meh.

1010,"Pick it up on a sale, it is a fun game but has a lack of players so wait for a sale."
1011,"Horrible version of the original.
I downloaded this since every HL1 server is ran by fat old dudes who like banning people if they aren't cool enough to play on their dumb server. I'd rather play TTT than this shit."
1012,"A true classic. I got it with the Orange Box, so it doesn't really matter how much I paid. It is good. If only more people played."
1013,󠀡
1014,prety buggy but i love the graphical improvements
1015,"This game is one of those games that you play when you're bored and have nothing else to do, but in my book it's what I call pretty fun.  I recommend it to those who try it, battling against people using Half-Life weapons is so much fun!"
1016,if you enjoy a horrible bugged game that is nothing but a half assed version of the original game but ported to the Source engine than this is the game for you!
1017,A lot of fun. If only more people played this game.
1018,"No one's playing, but still a cool relic of the past."
1019,"Why is the deathmatch mode sold seperately when the original game had both the singleplayer campaign and the deathmatch mode bundled together for the same price as this game alone? Valve really pulled an EA on this one. This port is also really bad and half-broken all for some tiny graphics improvements (which look so wrong next to the dated 1998 models/textures). Unless you already love Half-Life and want to try every version, just buy the original instead.

1021,"Magnum and Shotgun battles are fun in this game....
      So are crowbar battles...
    Hell everything about this game is FUN
Lets get to Brass Tacks here Half-Life Deathmatch is a fun old school FFA game similar to quake.
 The game isn't that popular so you might come across a few servers that might have a few people playing up to 3-5 people playing which can be a real downside.

This game is worth a try but I'd have better luck finding more players to kill on HL2 Deathmatch.
 Overall expect a classic FFA game. My personal favorite guns are the 1-2 shot Magnum which can offer some exciting gun fights."

1028,Game has better facial animations than Mass effect: Andromeda
1029,"Buggy as heck, game has code cancer. Obviously hammered out in ""Hold my Beer"" moments. Was the game sourced out to a crappy phone book ad game production company? Get this garbage off the shelf. 

If your expecting HL deathmatch with some modern source fun, prepare to be disapointed."
1030,"8/10
Good deathmatch experience"
1031,"I have good reasoning for the thumbs down.

CONS:

1. servers are empty leaving one person to kill with a huge map

2. long downloads make me want to stop and do somthin else with my time

3. guns are useless and aiming is near impossible

PROS:

1. GREAT fps

2. though useless, the guns are pretty creative and fun to use

1051,Mixed opinion because Its fun for a while and is just brutal until you realise thats it usually theres a reason to kill but there just isnt it has no meaning but if you just want a brutal half life shooter vs actual people sure get it
1052,"I absolutely love the half life series and all the games, I recommend every single one of the games but am extremely disappointed in valve. The complete lack of ANY communication for TEN YEARS is completly disgusting, It is disrepectful to the fans who supported valve for years. Its sad that valve doesnt even have the courtesy to tell their fans that half life is dead. It is clear that we will never get a satisfying ending to an amazing story. I personally am not interested in anything valve has released since Episode 2, and if the single player story driven masterpieces of recent years are anything to go by, its that valve only cares about its games as service titles, and not their narative driven campaigns. I am deeply upset that we will never get to explore the atmospheric and exciting universe of half life again. Valve prides themselves on their independance and flat workplace structure, but its clear there is a lack of focus. Valve, like too many companies in the video games industry, seem to be too blinded on following the money, they have left behind those that got them there in the first place..."
1053,A Good multiplayer game.
1054,"I mean like, there's barely any servers, and you could play this in Sven Co-op. You could also buy the original H-L, you get the game, and the servers. And the servers actually have people playing them."
1055,"I just bought the Rainbow Six Siege complete eddition on uplay (were boycotting ubi for years) because these days ubisoft somewhat less greedy and intitled than valve corportation! What a crazy world we live in these days. 

Who would of guess that valve corporation will become that unethical micro-gambling piece of wasted human potential? Sure, money is good but video games always have been something more. It is a form of modern art.

At this stage valve corporation doesn't think that video games is a form of art but rather a form of business.

Art can't exist without sacrifice. And current valve employees are unwilling to sacrifice this cash cow in the name of art. 

Valve employees - don't you have enough millions stacked at this point? 

What a petty."
1056,HL is dead and Valve killed it.
1057,Like it!
1058,"Half-Bug: Source. If singleplayer might still be acceptable, multiplayer part is completely broken. Honestly it feels like the game was ported just for fun during a few coffee breaks in Valve's office. Please play the original game (multiplayer is still crowded there, believe me) and don't waste your time on this. They only good side of this game is that you can run or build huge and beautiful maps thanks to Source engine, there a few fun maps in MP but that's it. If you want to experience Half-Life on Source engine, try Black Mesa."
1059,"Would be a great game if Valve patched the bugs in it. And its player base is dead too.

1063,i love this game but i bored
1064,"This game is awesome. 

You start this game up, you get into a server and you have a blast.

The game doesn't have many players but when you find the right server you have a huge amount of fun.

The surviving community is friendly and very competitive.

This game is very good and it comes with Half-Life: Source which is a one up for me.

7.5/10 Would explosive crossbow someone again."

- latency is fucked up (it's not problem your internet , I played this when my internet connection was really fast and it's still same) 
- Now this game will soon looks like a ricochet and deathmatch classic ( cuz i saw just 9 players on just 1 server )

1077,"game breaking bugs, get the original game instead."
1078,"Bloody awful. I actually prefer the original engine for Half-Life. And for another  thing, the game is FULL of hackers! This is a waste of money."

1081,"Without a purpose life is boring. I have a purpose. My purpose is to live to see the day that Homosexual dinosaurs return.

The answer is clear. Cryogenics. The rates are to expensive though, so for me i will build my own Cryo-chamber to live in.

I saw something that looked a bit like one in Half-Life so I will play this game for a millenia to find the needed blueprints."
1082,Ok...
1083,"[h1]New isn't always better[/h1]

[b]Half-Life Deathmatch: Source[/b] is a standalone port of the multiplayer mode in the original Half-Life that was developed on the GoldSource enginge. This port makes the game run on the newer engine that is simply just called Source. Unfortunately better engine doesn't always mean better game.

Half-Life Deathmatch: Source does everything you would expect. Better sound quality, better poerformance on newer computers and simply just faster to boot up. Unfortunately Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is a lazy port and doesn't really deserve to be played.

If you want a better experience on the Half-Life multiplayer I would suggest for you to pick up the original [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/]Half-Life[/url] for better experience. Sure, the engine might be clunky and outdated but trust me, you'll have better time playing it over this mess.

What is so different about Half-Life Deathmatch: Source compared to the original Half-Life multiplayer? Everything. Half-Life Deathmatch: Source feels nothing like the original. You get stuck on things; the movement feels extremely awkward. And that's the biggest problem. Even though the newer engine handles physics better than the old one it still manages to screw up the mechanics of the old multiplayer. Then comes the random crashes. And last but not least, oh no no this one right here is a huge problem, are that everyone in the game are bullet sponges. Sometimes it takes an eternity to kill just one enemy. Unless of course you've hoarded each and every exlposive weapon on the map. Then the multiplayer just becomes a domination spree for you.

So I don't know... How could I conclude this? Buy the original, don't even consider playing this one."
1084,"WOW! 8/10
This game has a few bugs and glitches but thats what you have to expect with how old it is. I very quickly got killed over and over again by the diehard player with thousands of hours but still had lots of fun! This is a highly chaotic fps set in the Half-life universe and is super fun! You gotta play it!"

Get Half-Life 1 instead."
1095,"The black sheep of VALVe's family...

This game is really fun, I've poured many great hours in it. But it is PLAGUED by bugs. Game breaking bugs that alter the way to play. It has been this way for nearly FOUR years and they'll probably never fix those. I willl not recommend this game until the bugs are fixed, this needs to change."
1096,You Serious?Got kicked becoz of saying the word nigg.a?
1097,An Instant Classic!
1098,"As far as free Multiplayer add ons go this is great and a whole lotta fun

Pros
From what I've played there seems to be quite a lively community of players for this game still 
This is some really fun old fashioned run and gun Death match action 
I don't typically play online games that often but I still had plenty of fun and even ended up winning a few matches 
There's plenty of maps to play on and no match was exactly the same

Cons 
I'm not sure if that much effort was put into balancing this and it may have just been released to add multiplayer for the sake of having multiplayer for instance a few weapons feel a bit OP like the shotgun and rocket launcher but even if this is the case the game's still super fun 

So yeah this is a pretty basic multiplayer add on but still super fun and I'd definitely recommend checking it out"

Im not joking it actually is. The servers in HLD source are dead and not really much people play it anymore. The game contains alot of bugs and glitches and are still not fixed yet and they are still in the game today. Get Half Life 1 Or Black mesa if you don't wanna experience bugs and glitches."

1141,"People still are playing online to this day anf that's pretty impressive. I stopped in for a few games and surprisingly the highest ping I saw was 200, so the games were playing perfectly for the most part. I like the larger maps a lot, it's what makes me come back to this game. The sequal is great but it lacks that oldschool Halo 1 feeling that the original has. There are also some really good weapons in this game that are not in the second, which causes some balancing differences. I feel like the first game is a little more balanced, and the maps are also. I prefer to find myself not feeling left out in the open or dying at spawn which this game has none of. I wish all of these maps were ported to Counter Strike Source for both deathmatches and bomb games."
1142,its good
1143,"Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is a multiplayer FPS game. The game is using the ''Source'' engine. (Same engine as CSS, Half life 2 & etc.)

The game is dead but if you do find server with players it is VERY VERY fun.

Pros-
Fun gameplay
Large amount of weapons
No 9 years old kids that swear on their mic

Cons-
The game is dead.
The graphics are bad and doesn't fit with the ''Source'' engine
You can't change your player model

I personally think this game is more fun than Counter-Strike Global-Offensive (when played with other players) because there are not ''Toxic Russians'' in the game. ( I am not saying that Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is better than Counter-Strike Global-Offensive ) But i don't reccomend you this game because it is dead and it is low chance to find server with more than 7 pleyers. 

If you want to play Half life 1 deathmatch just buy the original. It has single & multi player and it has more servers with actual players and it is less glitchy.

This is my personal opinion don't hate on me please !

If I missed something or made a mistake in the review please reply without hate speech !"
1144,this is fuciiing amazing
1145,"PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE BUYING

Half-Life DeathMatch:  Source is just Half-Life: DeathMatch (Not DeathMatch Classic), in the Source engine (BUT) it is broken thanks to SteamPipe.
If you really want to play it you should buy it, but if the bugs hamper it too much go online and find a NoSteam crack (Not Illegal because you already paid money for it) and it should run greatly, and with very few bugs.

Now onto my review.

Half-Life: DeathMatch Source is a very well made game. (before steampipe) I would highly recommend doing my above method to play this game for anyone looking to get back into Half-Life DeathMatch, but thinks the graphics could be better. Not many play online so I would recommend a BotMod for it.(Search it up online). The water and skies look amazing, the lighting is good, and  the guns, the models, and the testures, are decent. I have found the recoil is  different (It reminds me of going from CS 1.6 to CS:S) but besides that normal gameplay is very much the same as The GoldSrc version. Please buy the bundle that includes Half-Life:  Source, as it is also great. (This game also gives you more models for GMod 8.2-16)

1149,"Good, ""old"" Half-Life. Very positive."
1150,the source engine is not meant for half life!
1151,"Once upon a time in a world far far away, there lied a game where a US player would have too wake up at 3 am too get a server with decent ping. Even then the server would have 80+ping.  Honestly if your gonna buy it , buy it along with Half life 2 episode 2 and half life 2 episode 1 , Half life source is also pretty shitty. But hey Im just a wiener what do I know :P"

1167,"Сюжет игры полностью соответствует сюжету оригинального Half-Life и повествует о происшествии в исследовательском центре «Чёрная Меза», расположенном в американском штате Нью-Мексико.

Действующий персонаж игры — молодой талантливый научный сотрудник Гордон Фримен, работающий в Лаборатории аномальных материалов. Обладая низким уровнем допуска, учёный не подозревает о том, какие опасности таит в себе предстоящая работа. Однажды утром Гордона направляют в тестовую камеру для проведения стандартного анализа кристалла. Последствия эксперимента, однако, оказываются катастрофическими."
1168,I don't know how or why this game randomly showed up in my steam library but it is really fun and it's like an upgraded version of opposing force multiplayer.
1169,this is episode 5
1170,Hello???!! Does anyone play this game anymore?? I'm so lonely when I join a match and there's no one there. Please get people to play this again. #BHLDB
1171,"This game is one of the most hardcore and competative games out there, CS GO has nothing on this titan of skill and overall bohemith. Words are horrible at describing the magnitude and ambition of this one of a kind competative fps experience."
1172,"Still very good game, though you're not really gonna find many players on the servers at this point in time, maybe at a max of 10 or 11 people. But nevertheless its still very fun."
1173,it's fun
1174,"Half Life Deathmatch Source is a multiplayer game based on Half Life Source where you fight to win in maps based around the first game. 

As stated before it's based around the first game, so you will see certain environments and use guns from the first game.

Now is this game good ? Not really, it's actually kind of bad. 

The gameplay of the first Half Life in general was very stiff and in general kind of clunky and while it was sort of tweaked for Counter Strike and Team Fortress, I felt that this was generally untouched. 

The hit detection for most of the guns is absolutely terrible. A point blank headshot from the shotgun will do little to no damage.

The community is also dying as there's not many players online, even more so than other classic multiplayer games made by Valve. 

Graphically the game looks pretty bad, but for a game for it's age I'll give it a pass.

Overall there's not much to say about this game, other that it's not worth your time or your money. It's bland and the community is dying rapidly, so just save your money and buy something else.

Pros:
+ Fun for a few games...

Cons:
- ... but loses the fun factor really fast
- Hit Detection is horrible
- Community is dead
Final Rating:
4/10"
1175,"The nostalgia.  The feels.  
Not too many people playing, but the occaional occupied server here and there is nothing short of fun, one of the few games I can't get bored of.

1176,Weapons' power dont balance well. Such as; you cant kill someone with a single rocket shot but you can kill someone with a single graneade when his/her has almost full armor.
1177,People still play this game. I had fun
1178,Another valve multiplayer game with a serious case of the jitters. I rally dont get it. If anyone can iluminate this ball ache for me I would be most gracious. It appears my machine just doesnt want me to play valves games.

It's basically half life but with way harder targets and also the targets have way more health."
1184,"Quite a fun game indeed. I had loads of fun and, whilst it's not Black Ops 3 or Battlefield 1, it's one of the best, fun and quick-paced action games I've played on this platform. I highly recommend it. It's free, too!"
1185,"This game has possibly the worst netcode I've ever seen, and the physics are just bad. It isn't fun at all. It's an ok game to check out if you happen to have it."
1186,"[u][b]-Quick Review-[/b][/u]
Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is an exclusively multiplayer FPS developed by Valve, and released 2006 (God I feel old)
Basically Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is where you use all the weapons from the first Half-Life game, and you play against other people. Unlike another game I played over the weekend (09/03/16) there were actually people on this game. But there's not very many people playing this game.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=757644964

[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]
[b]Story:[/b] The story is Gordan Freeman has gone batsh*t crazy and fighting against himself. Apparently once upon a time you could change skins, and there was a community for this game. But just like walking through a ghost town, all you see are the houses where people used to live. There are still PLENTY of servers to join, but no one to play with. It's always kinda sad to see this happen to a game.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] As far as I can tell, Half-Life Deathmatch: Source uses the same weapons as Half-Life. Just like Half-Life 2: Deathmatch uses pretty much the same weapons and features of Half-Life 2. The only difference is that as of now there are still people playing Half-Life 2: Deathmatch.

For those that like handholding and my sarcastic descriptions, here are the weapons you get: The almighty Crowbar, whom I informed everyone that I was a master of crowbar-fu. A pistol, which I had the accuracy of a stormtrooper... was it lag? or am I bad? The world will never know. You've got your revolver, which Chuck Norris can slam a revolving door [i](yeah, I stretched for that one.)[/i], your various assortment of SMG, shotguns, railguns, crossbow, laser tracking rocket of death, grenades, trip mines, alien gun, mining laser, and death-by-blue-vortex.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=757644974

[b]Conclusion:[/b] I feel like it's weird to see Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is priced at $9.99, while Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is priced at $4.99... I guess it's that extra 5 dollars for the retro-status. *sigh*
This game is probably a pass, I could go either way on the recommendation status of this review. Based on what I played the game does what it's supposed too, there were a few people to play against, it wasn't a bad FPS death match game ... back in it's day it was quite the popular game, chances are you'll pick up this game in a half-life bundle, and truthfully you'll have more fun just playing Half-Life offline.
But, that's my thoughts on it, thank you for taking the time to read this review!
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=757644986"
1187,"This, is the game that you'll remember for being terrible, there are no headshots, the only usable weapon is the overpowered smg grenade launcher which has more ammo; damage and explosion range than a freakin rocket launcher, the rest of the weapons is just useless. The ragdolls are totally terrible, instead of animations - you get a ragdoll with rigid legs and arms. The skin changing is Not working properly, you have to do that through your console with a specific command, because lazy valve couldn't fix this goddEmn menu, it used to work, but now for some reason it doesn't. The players keep jumping around the map like goddEmn airplanes, technically no weapon is fun to shoot with. Custom maps aren't making anything better, they make everything even worse. I'd say something else about this game, but its simply - empty."
1188,Good
1189,I like this game
1190,nobody's gonna read this so nobody will know that i'm gay
1191,"I mean, if you're reading reviews for this game, something may be wrong with you. I played a little bit of this game back in ~ 2007-8 on my father's steam account and I had fun. It's dead now though"
1192,classic
1193,"This game is half broken now, there's no real good reason to buy it, Not unless Valve fix their ""update"" that made the game it is today. Get the orignal Half-Life 1 or get Black Mesa instead."
1194,"Deathmatch port of the original Half-Life using the Source engine. Also empty and buggy. Avoid.

Disclaimer: This is in my library as part of the Valve Friends and Family Complimentary pack that I was given for pre-purchasing a Steam Controller. It's now empty, old and obsolete."
1195,"Got killed by leeches.
This is the result of radiation."
1196,Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is one of the greatest games I´ve played and go buy it.
1197,BEST GAME EVER
1198,"Ay yo', I'd much rather play Genital Jousting for TV-Game rather than this pile of pooka.

Seriously though, I spent 476 hours of my life playing this game that I won't ever get back. I spent years trying to gain a reputation and trying to become the best of the community for absolutely nothing. Now I know, it isn't the game's fault, it's more alike my fault. But please, for the love of God, do not make the same mistake as I did. While it might be based on one of the best FPS Games ever made, do NOT waste your money on this game - I would only recommend buying this either for those who are interested in collecting games or want the content for Garry's Mod. Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is basically a half-as'sed port of Half-Life 1 to the Source Engine but with bugs, glitches, and a almost completely dead community. Valve broke any sort of functionality back in 2013, when they ported the game over to Source SDK 2013. Even before Valve broke the game, the game never felt right in the Source Engine. And whatever you do, do NOT listen to all the Nostalgic Fa'ggots and Half-Life Fanboys who are leaving this game positive reviews. They're only leaving good reviews just because it's a port of a classic game. Valve can literally go out in their backyard and fish out the crustiest pile of dog shieet with a plastic bag and stamp the name ""Half-Life"" on it, and people will still buy it because it's ""Half-Life"". In conclusion: buy the original Half-Life or Half-Life 2 Deathmatch instead for those who really want to experience Half-Life 1 Deathmatch or just Half-Life Deathmatch in the Source Engine.

There would be no doubt that I would get a refund if I could. But unfortunately, I can't."
1199,"ok so I gave it some love and passion but due to the steam pipe update back in '13 it became really buggy for most old source games and has barely any players ( if there are any, mostly playing it on 169 ping servers) I did had a fun time with it and get very qaotic if there 24 players. But i would not recommend this or HLS due to there very buggy state.

get the original game(also has multyplayer standard) or Black Mesa"
1200,"A really nice way to reboot the HL1 mutiplayer, that was and is still awesome.

Pros:

-Half-Life.
-Graphics upgrade, comparing to the classic Deathmatch.
-Did i mention that if you buy Episode 1 this game comes free?

Cons:

-No flying Santa Clauses, unlike the original."
1201,i would give 1 out of 10 cuz server sucks there are so many cheaters in 2k16
1202,Fun on LAN
1203,this game is outdated and if you find ppl they only use crap like the rpg and charges so dont bother with it
1204,"Still play it from time to time, and it's still fun. Really enjoy it!"
1205,"Old But Gold,and there still people playing,so why not play it :)

(BUY IT ON A STEAM SALE IF YOU CAN!!!!!!!!!)"
1206,"It's the multiplayer for Half-Life: Source, which I haven't played but I know is just Half-Life again, but with better water and lighting, ragdoll physics, and a whole host of bugs. Since almost nobody plays this version any more, and Half-Life's multiplayer was never really that great in the first place, I see no reason to buy this. However, I got it free when I bought some other Half-Life game (I forget which), so if you came upon it the same way, sure, give it a whirl. It won't cost you anything."
1207,"I got this game when I got Half-Life: Source, it's actually pretty neato I suppose"
1208,Fun Game
1209,"[h1]Half-Life:  Deathmatch Source Review[/h1]
[b]by KTMboyz[/b]

[i]""...hmm...It's pretty fun.""[/i]

To start things off, I have never played Deathmatch Classic, so this is a review for what I think of this game and not as a source port.  Half-Life:  Deathmatch Source is self-explanatory.  It's Half-Life - and its deathmatch - and its on source...  lol.  There is a reason I don't recommend it and thats's because, just like all the other Half-Life multiplayer games; they're dead.  Nobody plays them anymore!  Half-Life 2:  Deathmatch has a few more players but not much.  It's a shame, this game is fun as hell!  It's got fast-paced gameplay and intersting source maps that are Half-Life 2-ish.  Don't pick it up on your own, barely anybody plays it...  If you get it in a bundle or something, then play it, it's a blast!

1212,I made the biggest mistake of taking this game around the world.
1213,This is better than 80% of AAA multiplayer games to date. not even joking. I love this game.
1214,"you might be thinking... ""ghost isn't this game dead?"" nope not at all actually there are still players playing this game to this day!"
1215,this game somehow Poped up on my Libary but why not take a Free old classic game
1216,This game is extremely fun to play with friends but not many people actually play this game. I do however recommend this game but make sure some of your mates get it too.
1217,+++
1218,"It has some nostalgia to it but there is new games you can play. 

You move fast, everything has a classic feel and look to it but there ain't many players and it does have all the old flaws. One of thoes flaws is, do you know where the bazooka is? You win! Also, aiming is hard as all hell."
1219,"THIS. IS. AMAZING.

The weapon spam and mulitplayer feel REALLY makes me like it.
My friend and I thought that the tesla gun was overpowered, though.
Please nerf it?
And can someone please tell me how to change my model. I select a model, but it never shows in-game."
1220,"unbalanced weapons: the game

half the times you spawn, it's just BOOM.

the smg grenade launcher is extremely overpowered.
and don't get me started on the exploding dart gun.

1221,"Many memories, good memories, but no recommendation due to being extinct."
1222,"[b] This game was added to the Orange Box if you're wondering why it appeared [/b]

1224,hl dm source is ok
1225,"Cool game, not too many people though.

In my honest opinion, I think this was better than half-life 2 DM.

Don't buy the game itself and save yourself some money, and just buy the valve complete pack or HL complete pack when it goes on sale, like everyone else does."
1226,its great actually
1227,cool.

Been playing this game since 2004, and still nobody can take me down. ;)
Unfortunately there's only ONE active server. And that server is broken, and kicks you every 7 minutes for ""being AFK"". The server is also based in EU, so don't expect a ping lower then 150.
This game needs to be revived, I miss my favorite game.
In it's current state, it's unplayable. Literally."
1231,6/10
1232,cute gordon
1233,i like it sorta eh should of been a workshop i  mean there would be so much more to do if it hand a workshop but its fun for what it is so uh buy it also buy half life 2 death match
1234,"I have no clue how did i get this game, but its kinda fun i guess..."
1235,"It just appeared in my library and I didn't know what to do, so I played it.

And how grateful I am that I did, it's gameplay is simple, but still fun, there isn't anything competitive and it just feels like a breath of fresh air from highly competitive games like LoL, Dota, CS and COD. Playing this felt so good and refreshing with no one raging or hacking and there isn't even voice chat to bear risk of driving everyone mad.
The 15 or so people that play this game come and go, being happy and silent as the familiar scramble to the nearest weapon becomes a new chalenge of getting those guns off the person who has the most.

Classic Deathmatch the way it should be, to be played casually or religiously, 10/10"
1236,"This is a completely unneeded port. It's less fun than the original. The community is dead. A few textures are improved, but most are still the same exact stretched old ones. If you didn't get this for free, and you buy it. There's something wrong with you."
1237,"After the release of Half-Life 2 and then the Orange Box, Valve had already remade and ported Counter-Strike, Half-Life, and Day of Defeat to the Source engine, and also made the unreleased ""Team Fortress: Source"". These remakes varied in quality, with Counter-Strike getting a full overhaul and Half-Life getting a simple port with barely any changes. It was around this time that Half-Life Deathmatch: Source was released. Like Half-Life: Source, it was a simple port from the GoldSrc engine that introduced very little changes.

In 2013, Valve introduced Steampipe, which would simpify downloading their games and not have them take up as much space. However, the update caused numerous bugs and glitches across all of their games, notably Half-Life: Source and -you guessed it- Half-Life Deathmatch: Source. As of writing, Valve has barely fixed any of these glitches.

Now, where do I begin?

Again, Half-Life Deathmatch: Source suffers from countless bugs and game breaking mechanics. Like Half-LIfe: Source, it shoves so many special effects into assets and maps created in[b] 1998	[/b]. The chrome effect that you could see on the revolver in the original Half-Life is slapped onto every weapon and every silver texture in the game. The lighting is okay by itself, but it's ruined by the overpowered bloom. I've seen better bloom in the Cinematic Mod for Half-Life 2! And there is so much more visualwise.

The hitboxes feel weird, and it seems that Valve fixed only the player hitbox so the game is somewhat fair. The MP5 grenade is a one hit kill and you'll bet that me and other players spam these like crazy. Just everything feels like it was stuck into the game, no adjustments, no tweaking,  left the way it is. 
Here is the final nail in the coffin for me: sometimes textures don't even show up on the map, and you'll be standing on an [i]invisible floor.	[/i]

This isn't Valve quality. This is the quality of a fan that just got into Source modding, and released this under Early Access as Pre-Alpha. But this game isn't the scams you'll find sitting under the Greenlight, this is a game released by Valve onto their own platform. And that's pretty disgraceful.

However, at it's core, it's still Half-Life Deathmatch, and it can be fun. So if you own the Orange Box and you're looking for something new, give this a try.

Otherwise, do not buy this game."
1238,its dead only 5 servers with 2-4 people playing on at once so unless you like a game with no function wallet away!

great game but it is dead."
1249,"This suddenly appeared in my games list. Joined the one server that had 7 people playing on it. After 3 game crashes on server join it worked the 4th time. Map looked like a weird mix of Half-Life 2 mixed with Half-Life where rockets made water splashes when hitting the ground.

10/10 would get the game for free again."
1250,Yayyy!
1251,"An even more dead version of deathmatch from Half-Life. If you do find players, it can be quite enjoyable, but just like Half-Life: Source, it's filled with bugs. Just changing your playermodel crashes the game."
1252,"I got the game 4 free 4 some reason,but its generally broken,cant change player model,glitchy when walking up sloaps,cant pick up weapons sometimes,ragdolls broken,swimming broken,Weapons do too little damage , takes 7 shotgun gauges to the face to kill someone,or 2,5 BAZOOKA BLASTS.So yeah,its broken,community is dead, almoast no one playing and generally forgot abot.Dont recomend it."
1253,You know hackers are getting creative when they have lock on underslung grenade launchers.
1254,"Cons:

- Crashes easily, but doesn't make it unplayable.
- Hitreg might seem like it's trash.
- VERY low server count.

Pros:

- Addicting.
- Lots of players (I don't really see the same person all too often).
- A lot of generic video game skill goes into this.
- Rewarding.

You get this game from purchasing Half-Life 1 or Half-Life: Source, much like HL2:DM with Half-Life 2."

1264,"I can't really recommend this game due to it's dying community that's just *barely* hanging on to whatever is left of itself. I thought it was bad in 2009, but now...It's just sad. 

Which is actually depressing to me since this game actually had a lot of history with my childhood. And to add insult to injury, the last updates Valve had slapped together to make the game ""better"", basically turned this game in a steaming pile of crap: I can't even change my player model anymore. I still have fun with the game every once in awhile, but it's just not worth the money now.

In short. Save your money and get something better."

but it's fun wrecking them"

- Can't Change Player Model
- Broken Ragdolls(they float)
- Same Textures From GoldSrc
- Just Doesn't Look Right.

A Positive Though, It Still Has More Players Than Classic HL:DM & Black Mesa Combined 
(In My Experience)"
1268,Like 3 people still play it.
1269,It's a classic game and should make a comeback. They don't make 'em like this any more.

1271,Better than Call of Duty
1272,"if you want to play half life mulitpalyer, just play the original the orignal source of half life is good but not including the multiplayer. If they can fix the bugs and throwing of the c4 it would be good."

1287,The first PC game i played! Its great...
1288,This is Half-Life Deathmatch it defines the words [Gold Source Classic] but NOW it has souce technology. This game is very dated but that does not mean it is good. The only main problem I have for this game is that it is dead and there are usually only 1 server and it lags like hell so I do but I don't recomend it so I give this game a 5/10 score. The reason why is that this game is also full of many things such as you can't change player models. (just use the cl_playermodel command) but I do have to say this just to warn you if you ever want to play this THIS GAME IS LITTERED WITH BUGS. Elavators don't work as well as they used to and most of the guns are buggy like all hell but I would have to go mutual with this on a 5/10 score so Yes I do recomend it JUST USE CAUTION.

Until Valve gets this game working like it was before, it is a waste of time and money.[/strike]

That or bots. Bots are cool too.

This game has never truly lost it's charm, I've just found myself playing other games. But totally pick this up if you like getting your ass beat."

1297,ok
1298,"Im honestly suprised the servers are not completely dead yet. I'd reccomend it if you have some friends who you want to have some mindless multiplayer fun with. I really can't say how long the servers will be up but its not a matter if, its a matter of when."
1299,"Well,I bought the half life complete bundle and logged on to this game,I found a server with at least 4 people had fun for about 10 mins until everyone left and then no one else was on the servers. If there was more people that still played the game,I would love to recommend this! Though I would recommend everyone to not buy this,mainly because it seems as if this game is completely dead for sure. Though if you can,I guess you could play with your friends and still have fun with the game,other than that,this game is dead."

1301,"Let's make this short and sweet. I love Half Life Deathmatch: Source to death, it has great weapons, fun game play, etc. But this game is pretty much dead when it comes to online servers. However, a couple of people are on sometimes and I find it to be a fun little game to play at night when I'm bored. It's a shame more people don't play it..."
1302,Still not dead.
1303,"-Not updating
-Maps converted poorly (for example yard corner spawn on crossfire is dead point - player freezes on place, all lifts is unholy abominations from hell with additional platform over them for some reason et cetera)
-Weapons sometimes ""miss"" moment when player commanded to fire (tau cannon barrel continues to spin, grenades thrown on second or third click)
-Mouse sensetivity so vital to this game can't be increased over 6 - we have acceleration now
-No gibs

But from good here all benefits of source engine - improved physics and graphics with stabler connection
It's a good starting, but it only a STARTING that died out - another dead VALVe project. You'd better buy original HL if you like games of this kind - at least servers there are not empty"
1304,"----- PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING THIS! -----

This game is no longer functioning and should not be bought. A few years ago I would've recommended this game to everybody, but due to the Steampipe update back in 2013 this game was entirely ruined. Before I go on, let me define the word ""ruined"" as it's used in this context. By ""ruined"" I mean that this game is so properly glitched that you cannot even change your player model anymore! Yeah, that should give you an idea of how much Valve cares for their games. 

I blame Valve for this, but mostly an incompetent and lazy person whose name starts with an A and ends with a D, that was supposed to fix this using the input from the community on GitHub. 

So yeah, rather buy the normal HL because not only do you get the singleplayer portion of the game with the multiplayer, the online play is still functioning like it should and there is at least a player base. Oh, and if you are planning to buy Half-Life Source which is the other half of this, then don't. It might not be equally broken, but broken enough to make you mad.

Or just get Black Mesa, then you will at least get something that is prettier on the eyes and functioning like it should."

1309,"a great game that sadly has died
your lucky to find 2 servers that ATLEAST have 4 or 5 players 
however when you can find a server it can be a blast.
anyways i guess i'll talk about pros and cons

pros:
it's half life
gameplay varies in speed depending on how you play
allowing for face paced run and gun gameplay with things like the smg and shotgun
or slow paced camping gameplay with things like the gluon guns crossbow or tripmine
the list goes on and on...
maps are mostly ripped from original half life 1 multiplayer

cons:
community is dead with (like i said) servers only having 5 or six players usually.
alot of the few active servers often run custom maps that range from simple medium sized city maps using hl2 textures and models to weird rat maps with chipmunks voices in the background yeling things and youtube videos playing on screens.

overall i highly recommend this game especially if you can find something like a steam group/clan for this game like i used be in."

This deathmatch game is really great, lots of maps and weapons that make my nostalgia go crazy!
but the game is dead... I have played some hours with some awesome people, we hit a total of 10 people on one server for two hours!

The game is a little broken, in lots of maps some of us couldn't pick up ammo and there is some people that learned how to use the broken part of the game for there advantage (some wild jump kills and stuff)

Unfortunately, I only give 5/10.. mostly because the game is dead, but I still recommend this game because its a great game!

1325,This game is great really because of tyhe hammer engine. It allows players to make there own maps which in my eyes is the best kind of community support. Valve havent made a workshop for maps but you just make a server and select your map. then people see it and the either like it or dont. Physics is ok. OVERALL 7.6 out of 10. Well dont valve! :)

The playerbase is almost completely dead, struggling to get over 20 players worldwide a day. It's also far from competently made. It's buggy, unfinished, and clearly no thought was put into it. Not recommended."

1334,"Truly spectacular! I have had tons of fun in this game, and suggest you do the same. With custom content, the limits are endless. You will probably spend a lot of time on source engine maps, not GLDSRC, Which is good, but it kind of takes a bit from the anesthetic. Overall though, jolly good fun.

What sucks though is most of the players... Aren't very good, for most half life fans hate the Half Life Source stuff. So I am left killing newbies, 20 frags to 9...."
1335,"I'm biased wether I should recommend this or not.

I think the last time I played this, was 6 or 7 years ago, and there were already almost no servers online. Luckily, there was a server with low ping, that had some players; but eventually it died too. I rather play this Source version than the original. It has better physics, nice blood splatter effects like in HL2 (if you're into that)... With custom maps, the game can also look good and the sounds are better too. But the original GoldSource (HL1) version is still played more than this. Probably because more people own it. It's also kinda stupid that they didn't make Half-Life: Source and HLDM: Source one single game, like the original Half-Life 1.

Valve should make this free-to-play (they did it with TF2, so why can't they do the same with HLDM:S?), or at least ship it with ANY Steam game that uses the Source engine. Or sell it for $1 or $2 instead of $9,99 (which is ridiculous, after all those years). If more people would own it, more people would play. I only got this because it was included with Half-Life 2: Game of the Year edition.

I wouldn't recommend it if you expect to play online.

Last time I played it I saw the same people, from when I first bought Hl2 ep 1, and got hl1,2 deathmatches.

1377,"this is basically half life 1's multiplayer mode, it has an improved physics engine for ragdoll, more advanced shadows and per pixel lighting for the flashlight to make it look more realistic, I used to play it pretty much all the time and would still probably play it more often if not for the host of annoying bugs that have persisted for years.

Bug number 1: entity duplication

This bug is responsible for essentially ruining several maps, everything from ammo and weapons to glass and moving objects such as doors platforms and trains, this means that every time you push a button to open a door or move an object you will be blocked as one of the spawned objects refuses to move, i'm looking at you tower hatch in bootcamp

Bug number 2: everyone is gordon

another bug is that the player model select menu doesn't work! so everyone is gordon because that's the default, this happens EVEN IN TEAM DEATHMATCH where your playermodel is meant to switch depending on what team you're on, the only way to change it is via a console command which must be done every time you start up the game

If all you want is to play classic deathmatch then it's still technically functional on the more basic maps, but more complex maps are pretty much impossible to make due to the entity duplication bug affecting brand new player made maps too"
1378,"Now this is really funny, dont forget to use granaaades"
1379,"It's basically Half-Life, but in Free-for-all form. All the weapons from Half-Life are in here.

This game is DEAD though. So if you can host a private server and get a couple of your friends to play, then this game is awesome!

Great for fans of the original Half-Life. Not so good for people who just wanna play. There are much more people playing the original Half-Life Deathmatch and not the Source ""remake"" version. Just don't expect to find anyone playing on a Public server."
1380,"Great game. But that is if you have somebody to play with...... i play with my cousin and my friend, it is enjoyable and funny with all the trip mines XD. Amazing game.

1400,"Summary: It may be more compatible with Windows 7/8/8.1 than HL1 normally is, but aside from compatibility and better lighting, there's not much to make this game worth your money.

First off, nothing has changed from HL1's multiplayer mode.  The maps may be running on Source, but there's still no props or anything-- it's still all just the map geometry.  More than that, you have to deal with the regular HL1 models without the HD pack, unless you feel the need to go through HL1 with Photoshop and do it yourself via modding (which will most likely not work on some servers).

Here's the real reason you want to stay away: 1) the GoldSrc HL1 has more players (source is pretty much empty, HL1 has a few players), and 2) this game is an EXTRA price.  That's right.  It's not like ""oh, they just separated it because it's a big file"" as Red Orchestra 2 and the CoD games do it.  No, you have to BUY the singleplayer for HL:Source (a broken mess) for $10, then HL Deathmatch Source is a standalone for you to slap down more money for.  Why not just buy HL1, with Deathmatch mode included?

Aside from what's above, what's advertised in HL Source isn't really that great.  The ragdoll physics are present, yes... however, they're bugged.  VERY bugged.  They lock up as soon as you die and you fall sideways in a stupid pose, whether you're posed to run in place on the ground, you're failing at parkour by getting your arm phased into a guardrail, or you're doing a handstand... sideways.  Other than ragdoll physics, the lighting looks better and the skybox is now 3D rather than a few jpg's of a New Mexico backdrop, but other than that this game has no real improvements.

Final verdict: It's a waste of money.  Just buy the old HL1, which will include this mode AND the singleplayer for $10 total.  It will also have HD models and the old death-animations rather than the failed ragdolls you see here.  It also has more players and better servers (both vanilla and modservers as opposed to a few vanilla).

It's not worth your cash, just add the original Half-Life (not HL Source) to your cart and move along.

EDIT: Take a look at these next gen ragdoll physics!

[b]CONS:[/b]
- not that many active players

[b]Comment:[/b]
Same case as with Team Fortress Classic, I've missed the golden days of this game when there were many players. Nowadays the community of active players is small and there are not a lot of games to join. I got this game with some other Valve games I wanted so I took a look at it. It's a classic Quake-type shooter so there isn't much to criticize. Gameplay is fun but lack of people to actually play with pulls down the experience.

1423,"Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is a remake of multiplayer part of HL1, the basic premise being that they ported same material off original GoldSrc engine to Source engine. It actually was released later after Single-player Campaign and wasn't so much loved either. It contains same graphical changes as in Half-Life Source, most noticeably water and ragdolls. But this time around it emits HD Models bundle from Blue Shift out.

And it's dead. Barely has any players.

To be short, it wasn't good idea at all. First, servers of original and remake aren't compitable, so it naturally splitted HL1 deathmatch community, in this case most stayed in original. Second, this Source remake as of right now is bugged. Not bugged enough to be unplayable, but just take look at popular map: Crossfire. The turrets there became unusuable, there is strange flying grate texture over lifts, it has double windows for some reason. Not pretty. 
So, stick to original Half-Life if you want multiplayer."

1434,That was fun :D
1435,"My all-time favorite game, it is still amazing. The story, the gameplay, it’s all incredible. With lots of epic moments, I made a video showing off all the funny moments in Half Life along with Hl2.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ac847NUk0"
1436,"Great game, very fun"
1437,The newer deathmatch is better and less empty. I recommend this for its benefits to Garry's Mod.
1438,you can do a deathmatch in real life if you arent a fucking wimp
1439,good
1440,"im surprised not many people play this, its awsome!"
1441,"Awesome Game !!!! 
Derp Face :P"
1442,What is drugs???
1443,Meh. Its okay
1444,"Although there isn't anyone really playing this game, it's still really fun and fast paced, great for LAN parties. If it had achievements added to it, more people would play it and it would be alive again. I really want to play this game as much as I play TF2, but it's so empty.

I love this game."
1445,Awesome classic multiplayer game although it needs more players
1446,"I bought this thinking it was going to transport me back to 1996 when I played Half Life Deathmatch at friends houses from dusk till dawn.

Unfortunately it is utter cr@p"
1447,Why no one plays it simulator 2015
1448,Played this game on Mum`s computer 10/10 would play on Mum`s PC again.
1449,idk bbq lmao????
1450,"It's okay, it's just a remake of Half-Life's online mode with better graphics. If you like these games talk to me. Username : Dr.Pepper.        ;p"
1451,I forgot what bunny hopping was until i reinstalled this game.
1452,"ded every other second, im pretty sure ill never play this again

10/10"
1453,John why the hell you still haven't finished it goddamn it!
1454,AWESOME!
1455,the only fps i'm good at.
1456,Best game ever.
1457,"Should've been included with the main game. Cookie cutter multiplayer with a gravity gun was how I described Half-Life 2's equivalent, except this has no gravity gun so there's not a single reason to play this."
1458,"this game is so much fun for LAN parties, get a couple of mates together and blow, shoot, stab, vaporize and otherwise maim the shit out of each other."
1459,the exciting prequel to Half-Life 2: Deathmatch.
1460,"i was called a ""noober""in the one game i played of this. Ten out of t"
1461,"Got this free when I bought Ep 1 & Ep 2. Sadly, barely anyone's on. :("
1462,"Very fun game, do NOT let the graphics decieve you.Here, I'll list the pros and cons of the game:

PROS:
1.People dont talk much,so not much of a risk of being called ""faggot"" or any of that shit.
2.Better than COD
3.Cheap!
4.Fun gameplay with a large assortment of weapons

CONS:
1.For some reason,it lags for me.I have no idea why.
2.Graphics are bad (But no one cares! :D)
3.Not many people actually PLAY the game.

So please,EVERYONE PLAY THIS!ITS FUN!"
1463,"Everything about Deatmatch Source is pretty much perfect, the only problem is that unlike other games this one lacks the abillity to get past the title screen. Still though, the title screen is really prety. It really has that classic Half-Life mood and almost makes it feel like as if though this were a game you could play. In fact, the title screen is rather inspiring as it gets you to imagine what it must be like to play the game. The font for the text is also really nice.

Jokes aside, I'm really glad I bought this when it was on sale because it's in a fuckawful condition. It crashes after -2 seconds and the most active server I could find had five people on, and I was lucky. I suggest you pirate the 1998 game because it actually let's you play and the community still has numerous 5-10 player servers as well as a 32 filled Crossfire one."
1464,Does anyone even play this?
1465,"sorry half life deathmatch source thought it'd be fun and memorable but no.
met you thanks to gman squad that I really liked the comedy machinima.
do not buy that this in beta.
servers are empty and few also not forget that they are full of lag.
I'm so sorry.
that's my opinion
if you guys do not like to ... ignore me, I'm just saying do not waste your money on this game.
never be fun as is the cs: go or tf2
addition to deathmatch games have the half life 1.
Or am I wrong?

Greetings to all

-blademaster"
1466,"Great multiplayer game, play it!"
1467,"Old but gold. Most of the maps are great and gameplay is extremely fun and hilarious if you're not a ""hardcore"" FPS gamer...the only crucial problem is that the game lacks servers and players!


...turns out half life has better graphics than this game"
1468,This game is good
1469,eerily empty/creepy
1470,Need this for Garrys Mod.
1471,"Valve updated this game after more than 4 years of not updating it. The update broke the game and the game is unplayable. Don't play until Valve fixes it.

Now Featuring: THE “NEEDS FIXING THE MOST” AWARD"
1472,broke the cannons on crossfire
1473,"Dead game, was crappy anyway so I'm happy."
1474,"На данный момент есть куча игр для игры по сети, так что в эту НЕ стоит уже играть)) Но люди все равно еще играют немного, я аж удивился зайдя в игру))"
1475,"Half Life Deathmatch Source is a lot of fun. If you're bored of TF2, HL2:DM and all the other Deathmatch games you could give this one a go if it's in a steam deal."
1476,"BUY THIS FREAKIN GAME
"
1477,what is a gordon?
1478,It came with half life.
1479,wot a letdown was expecting alot more especially as this game has been designed and developing by VALVE world
1480,Fun with use over a school LAN.
1481,"Great Controlings , not affected by source engine , very original feeling as HLDM. Nice and good."
1482,"3.7 GB. Wh... h... how is it 3.7GB?! What the hell, Valve?!"
1483,Am I missing something?  I wonder if Steam secretly deleted one of my games.
1484,Its as if HalfLife and TF2 combined
1485,Good for when you need that urge for gibbing people. Problem is servers are as empty as your average desert.
1486,Dead Game
1487,Yes.
1488,
1489,Awesome multiplayer.
1490,I played.
1491,"I personally like Deathmatch more than the normal Half-Life, but that might be because aliens r be vury scary D:
8/10"
1492,그냥 하프라이프 소스 그냥 멀티플레이 하는 거 잉여 작품임.
1493,"Fast gameplay,No skins,No keys,small player base, classic."
1494,"I remember thinking I'd walk in on some archaic broken multiplayer FPS. I was wrong, as I actually quite enjoyed it. My only complait is that the servers are... well... empty."
1495,Hehe...Half-Life 1 deathmatch and Quake Deathmatch is what started online MP shooters...good times.
1496,it [b]was[/b] okay.
1497,"Not much I can recommend about this, it's the same multiplayer as the original Half-Life, just with a different engine, there may be some differences, but they aren't really worth noting.

You are better off with Half-Life."
1498,"After Quake 1 this was the one.

Memorable battles with friends! 
Great engine and weapons - FUN

one word: EPIC !!!"
1499,★★★★★ 5/5 Good game! Good quality! / Хорошая игра! Хорошего качества!
1500,"Fast paced, competitive multiplayer action, tons of guns, many maps,all within the Half Life universe and running in VALVe's Source engine. What more could you ask for?"
1501,"i don't really understand why this exists, it's just bad hl1 deathmatch but janky and on source and there's no servers, i have way too much time logged on this it's embarrassing"
1502,"Half-Life Deathmatch Source is pretty much what you would expect, the original Half-Life multi-player in the Source engine. It's still as generic and stale as the original and pales in comparison to the myriad of quality mods available for both Source and Half-Life 1.

Not really worth a buy or a play. Hard to say anything else about it."
1503,This game is (HONEST!) still pretty fun! don't under estimate the power of old games!
1504,peniѕ
1505,half-life source deathmatch capture the flag xen 420 howard stern alex jones fbi cia: source
1506,ыы
1507,"The very definition of 'non-comittal gaming'. Death is of little consequence here and the frantic pace on even a medium size server will stop you caring when you do face the wrong end of someone's firearms. Buying this now will have the two-faced taint of 'retro' all over it. But don't let that dissuade you, its still a blissfully uncomplicated example of the Multiplayer FPS genre."
1508,fun with friends
1509,КАК В СТАРЫЕ ДОБРЫЕ ВРЕМЕНА)
1510,хуита какая-то :]
1511,Nah.
1512,ehehhheehha sdakds.j.... yah ... stay awy from this one
1513,madhouse with bees and exploding snark things
1514,better graphics than halflife dm but not many people play :(
1515,"This is a hard to describe game, but its fun, give it a whirl"
1516,"Amazingly there are a few people that still play this. I couldn't detect any real difference from the original though. It's not source engine textures, that's for sure."
1517,"The first time I played it there was only 20 people online. Maybe when you try there will be more, but to me this game is DEAD"
1518,Like half life source but online because half life source doesnt have online
1519,wud be beter if volvo didnt kill it
1520,Stinki poo
1521,"Really not much here other than a simple, tacked on multiplayer mode for half life. I don't really recommend it unless you get it for free."
1522,super puper game huyak
1523,оригинально
1524,Unclassicfied deathmatch game with ragdolls and physics.
1525,Go back to good old hl1 graphics with as much fun nline with alien weapons.
1526,Good Stand-alone multiplayer for Half Life 1.  Nice Action and good flow.  All the original maps are there and the models.  Very fast though not very graphical. Apply the HD Pack for HL1 Source and you've got an even better game!
1527,"Half-Life 1 running on the Source Engine. 

If you're wanting to experience Half-Life 1 for the first time, DON'T BUY THIS. Go buy the real thing instead. The only reason to buy this is if you're a Source modder and want all of HL1's content converted for you for use in Source."
1528,i always wondered what the source of hl2dm was
1529,"HLDM Source: R.I.P.  |  No one plays this anymore, all servers are empty."
1530,Отличная игра. Рекомендую всем любителям Half-Life
1531,fun and only 10 $
1532,dead
1533,"A fun, simple deathmatch mode using areas, weapons, and characters from Half Life 1. This is Source so many things look and run better. Weapons are scattered throughout the map and you can carry as many as you like until you die, in which case you'll respawn instantly ready for more. Games are hectic  and weapons run out of ammo fairly quickly which encourages moving around as opposed to camping in one spot."
1534,dont press the bunker button you pleb
1535,you can't kill people with sinks in this
1536,no kill
1537,Hell yeah!
1538,"It's like taking Team Fortress 2, making everyone Scout, and making them able to use every gun, all while playing as Half Life 1 characters. Very fun and fast paced.

Downside? The game is dead."
1539,i dont know how i got this but is fun :)
1540,Sucks.
1541,Meh.
1542,"It may have horrible graphics, and yes, at some points major lag, but above all its an awesome game!"
1543,"If I won't play the Half-Life 2 version of this, I sure as hell won't play this one.

*Update: OK, I played it, and liked it. Or at least some random mod in it. Funny and decent. Barely anyone playing though."
1544,"YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
"
1545,undisputedly the most epic multiplayer fps of all time. 10/10 would deathmatch agen
1546,Fastest Shooter Ever.  Clever Map Making.  My fav. Deathmatch
1547,"More or less the same feelings as HL1: Source. Lazy, should have been better.

However, it looks slightly better and can be less problematic on some hardware than GldSrc."
1548,herp derp ragdolls and quake graphics
1549,"last time I played this, it was chock-full of Russian kids.

does anybody even play this anymore lmao/10"
1550,"This game WAS good.
However, after many updates, its nothing more but a broken and empty game.
So unfortunatly I cannot recommend this game anymore :/"
1551,OMG TEH MOST AWESOME GAMEZLJ EVERZ CREATED!!! YOU GET TO SHOOT THINGS AND THEN RELOAD OMG...AND THE GFX SO MUCH BETTER THAN QUAKE III!!!!
1552,its very cool GAME!!!
1553,$ |\| 4 R |< $ !!!
1554,This is a fun mutliplayer first person shooter. My oldest son likes it.
