1,"Borderlands is basically the epitome of a looter shooter.
Taking a first person shooter as a base, and adding action/RPG elements such as mission-based progression, classes, skills, abilities, and, of course, lots of loot, Gearbox managed to create a game that should serve as a reference for all modern looter shooters.
Even if you are like me, and you generally don't like shooters, but love RPGs, you should still give Borderlands a chance. It just might surprise you. Yes, obviously, shooting is an important aspect of this game, but planning out a build and managing the inventory are equally important. Especially on higher difficulties.
The graphics might not be to everyone's liking. If you're looking for a photographic realism, you should look elsewhere. On the other hand, Borderlands' art style and the use of cell shading make it look great even 10+ years after its original release. And, if you're really turned off by cell shading, it can be disabled in the config files (there are plenty of guides online).
The soundtrack is great. Featuring such talented composers as Jesper Kyd, Raison Verner, Sascha Dikiciyan, and Chris Velasco it simply couldn't be any other way. And the use of Cage the Elephant's ""No Rest for the Wicked"" as the main theme is like a headshot. It sounds as if it was composed especially for Borderlands.
It's hard to comment on voice acting as most of the game is text-based, but the few voiced part sound good. And the enemies are also voiced adequately.

Borderlands is not a game for your typical Call of Duty/Battlefield fan. It's a shooter for RPG fans that like optimizing their skill trees and hunting for gear.
It's also an extremely fun game to play solo, and even more fun to play in co-op.

Steam Deck: Runs perfectly without any tweaks. I've played 150+ hours on my Steam Deck, and didn't experience a single problem."
2,"fun, but boss fights are broken and/or stupid"
3,the original is best
4,skags go boom
5,Best game ever made. Borderlands 2 and 3 are nothing. This game is the greatest!
6,Its an old game and the UI for sure takes some getting used to but it is still worth visiting and revisiting all this time later
7,yes
8,"100% still replayable to this day. If it isn't already, it will be considered a classic in the future. I love everything about this game, plenty of Easter eggs too if you look around."
9,good addiction
10,fun guns
11,ITS FUN ;P
12,get the remaster
13,Texas Simulator
14,OK
15,good game
16,"Fun, but a bit dull on your own. Grab a friend and shoot and loot. :)"
17,haha chopper go brrrrrrrrt
18,GOOD
19,The first game of one of the best game series
20,"Would change this to ""Maybe"" as a recommendation if possible. Fan of both genres it's mixing, just not the pacing and overall game play the underlying game engine offers.  Gunplay and movement are too slow and clunky.  The content and world don't quite make up enough for that like Half Life and Half-Life 2 did during it's campaigns."
21,"A Classic nowadays, it definitely has its own charm and feel and and prefer it for nostalgic reasons. I have hundreds of hours on the 360 and had to buy it again on PC and do not regret it."
22,fun game
23,.............................
24,best borderlands
25,"From the art style to the clever dialog throughout, if you haven't played the original of the franchise, I can't recommend it enough. All three of the main games are fantastic, but I personally like the first the most."
26,Fun game
27,This is trash. I don't understand how anyone can like this.
28,"I'd guide you away from this not because it's inherently bad, but because the sequels are so much better and still available.  They learned from their mistakes in the first game and really delivered in Borderlands 2, the Pre-Sequel, and Borderlands 3."
29,"The first of the Borderlands Series and while needed to get into it, does a great job at setting things up and establishing the  setting and building the world. Blow things up! Collect epic loot! Explore the Borderlands!"
30,its legendary

32,This is a good game. 10/10
33,You can tell it's the first game in the series
34,yes. i'd recommend this
35,I think I would rather have both my femurs broken than play another second of this game. It's not bad per-se but it's just so incredibly boring. Which is probably worse than it being outright bad.
36,"pretty much defined the looter shooter genre for years to come, amazing game."
37,"If you really want this, only get it on sale. This game is good until you get 3/4ths through the main campaign. It becomes incredibly repetitive and easy, and your character will probably be a bit overpowered. I was honestly just playing through the rest of it for the sole purpose of completing the game. The humor is also very dated, and I could care less about any storytelling/plot present. The gameplay itself is at least satisfying, but that does not justify the monotony that starts to come up."
38,Fun shooty
39,Good game.
40,i have played this game about 4 times now..and still love it..
41,it's fun
42,"i got this game with this other game called ""Borderlands GOTY Edition Enhanced"" and idk why but it really reminds me of that game? idk why they copied this one so hard and then included it with your purchase of it.... kinda weird imo"
43,"Base game is really linear, quest are mainly go there, kill that or bring something, however the combat mechanic is pretty neat. The ending was expected (a good joke I would say), but the execution started to feel draggy after a while. Stay away from DLCs tho, no fast-travel and maps are quite big. Honestly, they all felt like such a chore*.


*The Zombie one has a fun premise and world-setting at first, but after 40 minutes it becomes tedious, especially due to lack of fast-travel."
44,"so find the keys for the big Key 
between the side missions
kill the boss and finish the game!"
45,it a complete game and the dlc is just that dlc
46,Might be the best game ever made.
47,"this game is awesome, probably my favorite fps
(most of my hours are on the enhanced edition sorry)"
48,fun
49,"compared to BL2 or even 3 this is awful, boring, clunky and slow.
"
50,"It's just... boring.
I never have understood why this game is so loved.
But, no offence to others if they enjoy it.
Just not for me."
51,Fun game.
52,good game would play again
53,Classic.  Many more hours on other versions.
54,"Still very fun. Installing the character overhaul mod(you might need dr zed's patch) fixes most problems with this version of the game, versus the enhanced version."
55,Badmutha Game
56,"if you play a game released in 2009 dont come into this game expecting gameplay and graphics from 2022 or anywhere in the last decade. its still a fun game for sure and the story is fun and easy to follow through, though enemies and combat can get super tedious and annoying at times when enemies have health bars longer than the playtime of the entire series. try it a bit, then get into the real game of the series, BL2 8)"
57,"Multiplayer is gone, the graphics are poor, the UI is inconvenient to use, the gameplay is slow and grindy (borderline walking simulator), and as a whole, it is unpleasantly crude. 

If you get it for free and are desperate, you could give it a try. Don't waste money on it though."
58,This is a review about a game I have played. Ok that's the review!
59,Nostalgic as can be
60,"This is the first game that started the successful looter shooter franchise known as Borderlands. That means it must be good right? Well let's just say that there is a reason why people prefer Borderlands 2, Borderlands 3 or even the Pre sequel. Borderlands 1 didn't age gracefully. It has outdated design choices and the gameplay is lacking compared to newer titles. Despite all of that I'm willing to give it a positive review because it was the first in the series and it was in a perfectly acceptable state in 2009. After all times change and you shouldn't expect all games to age well, especially if they had multiple successful sequels. 

I can recommend this game only to veterans of the series that want to go on a nostalgia trip. The rest would be better suited to play the newer titles."
61,A game that can get heated in an instant.
62,its a trap
63,"Play the girl, have fun, phase blast your foes. GG"
64,"Corrupted savegame in 21. century? Really? With all that cloud and sh**?

I don`t believe this! Level 36,, almost at the very end of original game."
65,Comes free with Borderlands GOTY Enhanced for even more achievement grinding fun.
66,"Classic.  Got all the way to BL3, quit after it went hyper-woke.  Shameful."
67,Game is fun if you like shooting and old styled games
68,"[h1] 100% Borderlands GOTY Review [/h1]

Very enjoyable game, I 100% this game a 2nd time now, since buying the first game comes with 2 copies, I replied this game again with a close friend of mine. This game is great with a friend, if you wanna know we beat it with Lilith and Brick. Game isn't to hard to 100% either, just a bit of grinding near the end.

Just a side note, for the arena achievements, either your friend plays a low level character, or have a third person be one, cause going 100 waves for the three maps is very diffacult if you're doing them legit, which can make this a lot more harder. Also side note, only the arena DLC with Moxxi is buggy, with a problem that your game will freeze and you'll have to reset all progress. Thankfully our third player, which was my wifes PC was the host and she didnt fight, so it was easy on her PC. But if your activly playing in it, there is a slim chance your game will freeze and you'll lose all progress. This little nit pick made it a bit more troublsome to 100%, but if you don't care about 100% competion, then this won't effect you to badly.

Overall great game with a friend, although i suggest you play this one first out of all the borderlands, not only to get the story, but this game got some problems as no mini map, loot being a bit weird, some characters just kinda sucking or being bad, having to level weapons to be more effective with them. The second game does much better taking care of all this, and playing this first will help you look forward the future games, and going from a newer game back to the older ones can be more diffacult to adjust to without some nice quailty of life.

Another note is I have only played this game with a friend, so I don't know how well this game will be for solo, and I know some of these achievement will be VERY hard solo. Solo completionist beware"
69,always a classic
70,nah not game of this year maybe a year but not this one or next
71,good
72,The classic that started it all.
73,hurts my brain but love it i wish i could be able to fawkan  hit the guy im shooting at though
74,aim punch makes me look like i have parkinsons
75,is good
76,Indeed
77,good game :)
78,I can finally uninstall it after aging 10 years in Underdome
79,yes
80,"I played it on PS3, Switch, all my PCs and now also on Steam Deck. And I have no doubt I will be going back to this game a lot more times. While not as hilarious or gripping as Borderlands 2, it has its unique charm. It's a great entry to one of the coolest gaming franchises."
81,"never played this
"
82,"Bonehead is still the hardest boss in the series, the FOV gives me a headache, car physics are hilariously bad and overall the game has aged like shit

but its still pretty fun"
83,explosive punch spam good
84,the first one and second borderlands games all that matter
85,It's a fun game and it still holds up. Most importantly it runs on my potato.
86,Bessie
87,"Not a fan of fps games usually, but the Borderlands franchise is just class (at least 1 and 2)."
88,it's fun
89,"Classic addictive Borderlands. Never gets old. If anyone is in the EU region (close to Italy), then add me and we can play together."
90,you don't want none of this merc
91,what does goty mean
92,"Ah, the game that started it all. I can still remember when my older brother invited me into his room to play this with him (a rare occurrence made even better by such an enjoyable game) and I literally thought it was a perfected Halo 4 (the irony right?) I have since played this game on 4 different platforms and enjoyed it on every single one. I will always recommend Borderlands to anyone who's looking for a good FPS co-op game."
93,"Borderlands 1 is a great looter shooter even today. The tone of B1 is slightly different compared to the rest of the series though. Pandora has a more bleak and color drained feel to it. The comedy is still there but not as in your face compared to how much there is in B2 and every game afterwards. In terms of story its also barebone by following a straightforward formula. Despite that, most characters are memorable. Gameplay wise things pick up with the various skill trees and gun diversity. While there aren't a ton of build options each character has interesting and engaging power fantasies! With the other games being available on steam it would be better to wait on a sale for this one"
94,"Borderlands has got to be one of my all time favorites. About 10 years ago I used to play this masterpiece on the PS3. And I have finished it a couple of times with multiple characters. With Lillith being my favorite (Siren's ftw).

To give a little something what you can expect from this game: You're a vault hunter, doing missions on the planet Pandora, seeking more information about ""The Vault"". You meet some crazy characters along the way, some have more interaction than the other. You have a crap ton of weapons to choose from (my favorite brand being the Maliwan for the elemental damage) and different kind of playstyles to choose from.

It's an easy game, even for new-comers to RPG style FPS games. But it's fun and really worth it. It's certainly worth the money if you enjoyed the other Borderlands games and want to know a bit more from the original game's lore.

Overal, 9/10

And for the completionists under us, it's really easy :P"
95,One of my first game I ever play in my life it was a great childhood to play it LOVE this game so much people must play the game again it was just great
96,"C'est le premier mais je l'aime beaucoup quand même. Moins barré que le 2, mais plus ""technique"". Les persos sont bien, l'histoire est...un peu moins bien. Les combats sont très très bons, certaines zones franchement géniales (old haven, la zone canyon ou le boss est tout en haut et nous canarde avec une grosse sulfateuse). Les dlc sont aussi très bons (knoxx, l'ile aux zombie et les claptraps en folie).
Par contre, il pèche un peu au niveau des boss, soit trop facile (hive) soit trop dure limite infaisable sans bidouiller (le mob voiture de la 2ème zone)."
97,"What can I say, it's the game that really kicked off the term 'loota shoota'. If you haven't played Borderlands yet, you are missing out on simple mindless shooty shooty bang bang. Not much depth, not even much story. Just lots of different weapons that do feel slightly unique and plenty of enemies to kill.

If you are looking for a new shooter, especially a co-op shooter with mates, it is on sale quite often. But in saying that, we have come a long way and there are plenty of good alternatives out there."
98,"It's better with friends: Putin, Stalin, and Mao."
99,Lots of  fun with this
100,iykyk
101,I've started this game multiple times. But I still don't like it enough to keep playing.
102,Ain't no rest for the wicked
103,its fun (:
104,i have no memory of this game
105,"Good FPS game with RPG-mechanics, and a unique sense of humour."
106,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
"
107,"I had a fun time, going back and playing this after starting the franchise with Borderlands 2, It's worth while.

As I write this, I realize, sitting in my library is an ""Enhanced Edition"" I've never played, that comes with dlc already.    

Overall Review: Hours of [strike] gun [/strike] FUN"
108,"I'm really on the fence whether or not I want to give this one a positive or negative review. Eventually decided to give it a positive review as it is different from the series and feels unique slightly more than it feels like a watered down version, which is also true.

The main issue is that the game feels terribly boring. It's so many sandy desert areas with very lacklustre music playing, all the while the series started being funny in the sequel, BL2. It leaves a lot to be desired, and I would recommend against playing this game when you feel down, as it looks depressing enough to boost that mood.

That said, for the time it did have a unique feel to it. It is the first game in what grew out to be one of the largest and most recognisable series within the realm of videogames. It does have a certain satisfaction in playing it and has a unique charm. Especially if you've played the later games first, you may have a newborn fascination for where it all began. There's plenty of fetch quests and overall not very inspiring characters, but there's something about it that keeps you going, a certain drive to see what's next. It's hard to explain.

All and all not a horrible game as it has its charms, but it is dusty (literally and figuratively) and can be arduous to get through.

For a game this old, you're best off buying the Game of the Year Enhanced edition while you're at it."
109,it's a pretty cool game
110,"i played this game on the 360 and this version is a fine port. not any game breaking issues or other technical issues i noticed. borderlands 1 is a rough game for casual gamers. i died frequently even when playing with a friend. still, it's a challenging game with a fun aesthetic (sketchy/inky 3D art in a mad max-esque postapocalyptic, but also space fantasy world) and interesting themes, definitely got me hooked on looter shooters. but yeah some mechanics are a bit clunky. in Fight For Your Life (where you get downed and if you kill an enemy you get Second Wind, where you resurrect yourself), not being able to move during it is unbearable, especially after you play the other games where they fixed this issue. lots and lots of irritating deaths because of that, but overall a fun game. lilith is pretty op with her powers when you level them up tbh. there's an alright variety of enemies to deal with.

dlcs are fine, moxxi's underdome is okay for the first 3 areas but the next 3 i refused to do because it was way too many rounds and not my kind of thing. general knoxx's armory dlc is alright, really hated the forced driving everywhere (seemed like unnecessary padding), story is ehhh but we do meet athena for the first time. claptrap's robot revolution was fun for a while, but the boss fight was obnoxious as hell. 

get this on sale, the borderlands games are always on sale so you don't have to wait long. as the first released, this game is a lot less polished than its successors, so if you're playing this after them, it's pretty frustrating"
111,"Absolutely love this game. Got it 10 years ago when it went on sale figured I would give it try and I have been hooked on the series ever since. Currently replaying it again with my favorite character, Mordecai. I think this is still my personal favorite borderlands game."
112,"Not really a fan of looter shooters sadly though COOP made this game slightly bearable. The graphics are pretty ugly to look at, i felt Borderlands 2 had the perfect artstyle for what it was going for while here it really feels like an early build. Not a fan of the humour just doesn't click with me, this entire game just feels like a test build while Borderlands 2 despite my dislike for the series, felt like it was the real game they were trying to make while this one here really hasn't aged well as again BL2 basically does everything better from what i've played."
113,"i love to play game 
"
114,"The great:

-Cool Graphics
-Great landscapes
-History lines
-Weapon system
-Humorous
-Rich story
-Characters with personality
-Bosses

The bad?
Nothing. Just enjoy it. Can ya?
"
115,"Loved this game! There were a lot of glitches and stuff wrong with it, still good though.

118,"Where it all started, will forever be my favourite Borderlands game out of the series <3"
119,"a good first impression for the series, although it feels a bit lonely out in Pandora for this game but that's nothing a few friends can't fix

honestly still holds up pretty well, would definitely recommend buying on sale if you're looking to get into the series, the guns still feel plenty creative the writing alright and the other side characters are all great (especially Scooter)"
120,boredlands
121,Loved borderlands since 2014!
122,good game as always
123,My friend Hunter doesn't want to get this. But it's good. This should help
124,fud
125,"What an awesome game. 

Borderlands is an FPS RPG that combines guns, character advancement, and the wild wasteland of a planet so similar yet so different from our own.

I first played this years ago on the Xbox 360, and had a ton of fun with the crazy mesh of design styles like post-apocalypse, old west, and alien sci-fi, which can be seen in the characters, scenery, and music; as well as the skill trees for each character and the endless amount of guns that make the game hard to get bored of over the course of a playthrough. 

Once I got the game on PC years later, I got this version so I could play the expansions, and they are just as fantastic as the base game, each adding on something unique and, as can be seen in sequels, valuable to the story.

I mostly played it by myself but it was fun having others show up, too. I'd say they helped me fight enemies, which they did, but we mostly spent a lot of time running each other over, haha. 

Grab this if it sounds like your kinda game."
126,Good with friends.
127,"It's good, but it did not age well and is a buggy mess at points."
128,1000000000000000 gun's dame. this game most have taken a while to make (joltzdude139 :youtube:)
129,"After all this time this game is still fantastic. Game play is great and story its great along as well. Although compared to 2 and 3 it doesn't feel as alive in the world, but besides that the story is great and sets up to the second game very well. Plus the DLCs are fantastic."
130,What is not to like? This is one of the best Looter Shooters ever. Great story line. Great game play. It is great for more than one play through. You can play with or without friends.
131,I enjoy this game. Best fps rpg.
132,Classic
133,Super cali fragilistic expealodosious
134,"Borderlands 1 is a fun and amazing game and still amazingly beautiful after all these years.
the story while not grand as its sequel its still interesting and sets up a lot of the backstory for the second game even some side quests have some lore despite the sheer quantity of them. 
The shooting takes some time to get used to, if you use 1 gun through the game the skill for it will level up and you wont have such a hard time shooting after that. Mordecai and Roland are my fave."
135,This piece of♥♥♥♥ 11 year old game lags on the lowest settings while my beast PC specs are higher than the game's recommended system requirements but that doesn't mean this isn't awesome. This is by far one of the best free to play games ive seen out there right now and it takes around 1 hour to complete. If you are a new player and f2p gamer it's definitely worth a try. PLAY THIS GAME!
136,pretty good game i have on console.
137,"I thought this game rocked when I was 11. While I've had many good times playing as a kid, my time with it as an adult has been okay. 

While I like that it's not shoving story and jokes down your throat, it feels much more like a prototype than a fully fleshed out game.

5/10"
138,good game to smoke weed and relax
139,Great shooter
140,"I actually started out playing the Enhanced Edition but it has some serious optimisation issues. Jumpy, unstable frames if there are more than five things on the battlefield, like - what the hell. It looks nice, sharper and stuff but I just resorted to the original.

The original game itself is pretty good. I personally don't think it's aged very well. Visually it looks fantastic but gameplay wise it's kind of weak. Mostly quest design and stuff. It's a VERY basic looter shooter. It's a shame since the environments are so interesting, great use of scale, good world building (I was actually intrigued enough to check out the Borderlands wiki to read more about the corporations and humans in space).

6.8/10 Influential to a lot of looter shooters today, gave us BDL 2 and 3 so that counts for something. This game is a chore though, Lord of Repetition. I'd imagine it would be more enjoyable with a crew though.
I think the DLC is a step up but also a step down in terms of getting to where you need to go. Fast travel sucks in the DLC since the areas are so massive and far away from each other."
141,"[h1] Retro Review[/h1] 
I recently acquired the original Borderlands game, mostly for nostalgia’s sake, after getting Borderlands 3 for free on epic. I really liked that gameplay but wanted to check out how the first gameplay wise and balancing wise worked.

[u] Gameplay[/u] 
In case you never played any of the games and want to start with the first or want to see how the gameplay differs from the sequels I’m going to explain the various mechanics and systems in the game.
Borderlands has 4 classes and their biggest difference is the active ability they got, a deployable turret for the soldier, a bird that attacks people for the sniper, invisibility and damage upon arrival with the siren and for me the mechanically most interesting is the berserker rush for brick, the main weapon become fists and life regenerates relatively quickly. But because he doesn’t have any SMG or elemental damage bonuses aside explosion he falls flat relatively quickly into the game.

There is also a weapon skill system. Albeit the game tells you x person is better with gun y its not actually the case, its more that they have skills to make those guns potentially better as they don’t start with a boost to the weapons skills or anything. You can pickup any weapon and as you kill enemies, they level up automatically, first being small bonuses but later on they can get quite big.

The reason I consider brick to be the worst character to choose is because his skills mostly focus on explosion and rocket launchers. The game features 4 Types of elemental damage: fire,acid,explosion,electro. I wrote them down from best to worst. Mostly because the best guns in the game is probably anything fire and SMG or Assault Rifle related. Fire is good against anything in general except with enemies that have a high shield, which most don’t have, acid against armored enemies which you fight a lot, explosion is generally okay against anything and electro obviously against shields. 

If you don’t pick up a mix of elemental weapons (or didn’t find any good ones) you are gonna have a hard time due to the very bullet spongey enemies on your own level. Game luckily features no type of complete enemy levelling, meaning going back to earlier areas will let you kill  weak enemies, giving a really good feeling on progression. Trying to beat very weak foes will earn you a very low xp yield, enemies above you are unkillable as they will have their damage reduced. So in a practical sense there is a level cap.

Most of your missions will be either fetch quests or kill quests with the rare novelty like shooting down bird poop from windmills. Mission marker dont show you the nearest item to pickup but in a set order which sometimes makes you walk twice around the map. Also you can sort them by area, but not by proximity. This means you have to click trough each mission until you find the one that is the closest to you. Not much of an issue but a bit annoying.

The most fun about this game isn’t the RPG elements as they focus mostly on passives and a single ability. It’s the amount of interesting and sometimes equally awful guns you find. You always find weapons that have some drawback, be it a very low accuracy but high damage or a very small clip etc. You never know what you get next, or which weapon you might want to replace. And I really liked this about the game.


Now at last my three biggest issues. The balancing and the console nature of the game. As this game is apparently focused for consoles first in mind, for some reason your pickup button also reloads when pressed on no item. Also you only have 2 , later 4 weapon slots, in a game that you can pause anytime (singleplayer) and exchange weapons on a whim. In a game where elemental damage types and switching between them is very useful to the very tanky enemies. Just a real annoyance I wanted to mention. Additionally, there aren’t really any coop players online, find a friend or go to the steam hub. The MP works totally fine, but nobody plays it anymore due to its age and the split playerbase between original and enhanced.

At last the reason i dont like the game that much. Its not the amount of traversing, atleast you can later on unlock a teleportation system and get relatively quickly a (altough clunky to drive) vehicle. Enemies can hit you from very far away, with a very low amount of damage, altough they can for some reason with their crappy weapons. You cant, but thats not a problem if the damage is low. The thing is the only way to kill them that way is to either get close, or use a sniper and aim for the head , as body shots with non elemental weapons are mostly useless. The thing is due to you being hit, your aim shakes this is especially annoying when playing solo, as there are no other people for the enemies to focus on. I absolutely hate this feature.

[u]Aesthetics [/u] 
While the visual style is directly apparent, especially coupled with the gore I personally am more impressed by the many visual differences between guns, their reload time and animation. Like there are dozens of different weapons including different animations, from clip reloading shotguns to revolver esque shotguns, snipers that reload like a revolver, having three or 6 bullets, or reload via a clip. Guns with various cables on them for the acid effect. 

The ost is also something worthwhile to mention, especially the more calm and atmospheric soundtracks fit to the game, game is voiced in many languages albeit the german version has a weird crash bug. Weapons sound different depending on the weapon type, from more heavy sounding revolvers to very silenced sounding pistols.

[u]Story[/u] 
The game has a story, find the alien vault. In-between many smaller sub quests and storylines, But overall, it doesn’t have anything interesting going on except the uncanny woman talking to you. She’s the main quest giver, the only outstanding character due to her being a real life film clip being altered via filters. The antagonist is completely neglectable.

Most people remember it because of its ""humor"". The games humor is mostly cringe to me with a few exceptions, but i dont mind sometimes a bit of cringe.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR [/u] 
While there is no reason really to play the game for its story except for franchise starters and completionists, the gameplay itself is still totally fine. Its different from the newer games with its weapons levelling, and obviously different classes and builds. I can recommend it but just barely as some might be turned off by the gameplay to start the franchise with this one but might enjoy the newer ones. I liked it although I have a lot of nostalgia for this one."
142,Great start to a good series. Definitely one of my personal favorites. I recommend giving this a try if you're a big fan of shoot 'n' loot games.
143,I love hearing the screams of Crimson Lance troops.

149,I bought the original Borderlands when it first released and I'm still playing it (once and awhile) more than a decade later.
150,
151,"Amazing Game, i loved it allot, some parts are too hard but i'm the one who suck at playing AHAH"
152,"If you LOVE bl2, you'll like this game. You'll have to mess around with the config files to ensure the best experience possible. It has not aged perfectly and is not beginner friendly, keep it's era in mind before jumping in. It's sequel is a much better starting point for the franchise in every way."
153,"this game is the best
"
154,good game
155,my friend play
156,Classic
157,This is an amazing game and it's kinda sad that the majority of people who have played Borderlands 2 haven't even played the original which can honestly be better at times.
158,fun rpg co-op shooter with a story
159,Oldy but a goody
160,yes
161,"This game basically invented the looter-shooter genre, and is still the blueprint for all games in the genre now, it introduces lots of unique features alongside millions of weapons to collect, the story isn't amazing, but that's not what you're here for, the gameplay is phenomenal even in 2022.

If you pick up this game, play the enhanced version that is packaged in with it, it's got some nice (toggleable) Quality Of Life improvements like a minimap and also has some new guns and stuff. but if for whatever reason you can't play the enhanced version then this version is still awesome."
162,"Loving reliving this nostalgic masterpiece. Check out my playthrough on YT if you haven't decided for yourself if it's your style! Plays pretty similarly to Fallout with more mystical shit in it.

164,fun game. much guns. lots kill.
165,"I tried playing this even with maxed out settings, the picture is insanely crunchy and there are no options for Vsync. I'm sorry but this just looks unplayable"
166,"15 hours in, all of a sudden i get a constant game crashing error, none of the fixes on the gamehub help, nothing on my pc changed, reinstalled twice already, and the given error says absolute nothing worth of noting."
167,"78/100

  I played this game for hundreds of hours as a Roland main and even played this game when my computer was so bad he screen was almost completely white and broken. Great early looter shooter, gun-play holds up, basic get to treasure vault story, and Awful level creep with how few skill in each tree."
168,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
169,great cartoony spongebob type fps
170,best game 10/10
171,A classic that holds up to this day
172,"I wasn't a fan of the main story's ending, but it was an alright game.
I would give all the DLCs a try expect for mad moxxis underdome, unless you love grindfest galore."
173,"Nostalgia 
I miss those days fuck"
174,Its ok.
175,"Sorry, not as good a writer as others, but this is just hands down one of my most favorite games ever played.  Shame the developers ruined it pretty much after Borderlands 2.  Great story, game play and music."
176,good game
177,"This is the game that started this crazy saga that also comes with Gazillion amount of guns to use to survive in the planet of Pandora. Starring four original Vault Hunters, they are on a mission to find the riches and put their names around the globe. It's got references, quips, jokes, and lots of chaos and destruction to go around. Don't feel bad by breaking things and killing people in that planet. After all, those people are mostly irredeemable with killers, psychos, and flat out ugly creatures. In all honesty, you are doing god's work to make the planet a better place. Be sure to visit Marcus-Munitions to buy yourself a good gun. ""When you are looking for the Vault, make sure you are packing!"" - Marcus

9/10 baby!!"
178,"An uninspiring shooter magnified by a flat, depressing tone and repetitive structure. The DLC is some of the worst ever conceived, each one is filled with witless design choices and astoundingly tedious gameplay.

Boredlands.

179,This is a wonderful first person shooter with lots of guns and lots of loot.  This is one game I would play over again.  The characters and foes are well rounded and respond intelligently.  The maps are super detailed and easy to move around in.

184,"Me and my brother love playing it. He's an avid BL player, and he helps me level and get loot. It is a great bonding mechanism, as are games in general."
185,"Just a reminder that Gearbox blatantly plagiarised this whole franchise from ""Codehunters"" by Ben Hibon.
Thank you Randy for your contribution. I hope you choke on that fartnite yuans."
186,"solid game, aged fairly well"
187,"it is fun to play i have played for 335 hours and it was the best 335 hours ever!!!
"
188,"Game is fun, but i recommend to play enchanted version Instead less bugs and it feel smoother"
189,"Majority says that Borderlands 2 is the best game in the franchise but this game is my favourite.

Could be nostalgia or my love for the Zombie Island of Dr. Ned DLC but I loveddd this game on the PS3.

If you're thinking of getting into the series then please play this one first, it's fantastic"
190,"Have actually played this much longer, having the game without DLC from a brick and mortar.  Bought it on Steam for the DLC as I couldn't get it even from the software publisher.  Played as Brick, Soldier and Siren.  Each character has its own strength, but I liked Brick and the Soldier best so far.  If you're a completionist, it is hard to get all of the achievements.  I haven't really done any of the team play.  Maybe with the added DLC getting more of the achievements will be possible."
191,only bad thing about this game are those damn maggots
192,"it is super fun alone, it is super fun with friends and all dlcs are worth it"
193,"epik
"
194,"I played Borderlands 2 first (and loved it) so maybe my perception is a bit skewed, but this was a bit underwhelming overall. I'm actually really impressed how they took this and made such an extravagant, funny sequel. I enjoyed playing through, but overall found the gameplay to be about as bland as the colour palette. Maybe I'm just not 'hardcore' enough..."
195,"With the quality of life additions to the Enhanced edition, I wouldn't come back. But, there are a lot of things that work better on this one, skips and the like, so if you area searching for the OG, look no further."
196,"I love this game, and it was one that I loved playing even with family, as we could work together - shouting across the house what we needed between our computer locations. Fantastic and fun, still one of my all-time favorites."
197,1
198,"This is THE BORDERLANDS for me. Big nostalgia right here. I picked up Borderlands back in the day for PS3, without knowing much about it and ended up playing the h*ll out of it with one of my best friends back then. The world had a certain feel to it, the characters were unique, the humour was, and still is the best (what can I say? It's random and it's dark as f""ck! Love it!) and the loot... endless. Since then I've replayed numerous times, solo and with my friends and love it every time. And ofc I always have to return for some good old Tartarus Station/Knoxx Armory/Crawmerax loot farming! I've still only gotten one Pearlescent weapon, damn it!"
199,Love all borderland games truly fun and addictive and remind of an older cartoonish fps I use to love called Serious Sam games. Would recommend to anyone who like fps and rpgs. Because it truly combines both in amazing ways.
200,.
201,"I hated every part of this game.

From the fetch and return missions to the NPC's that only have voice-over for one line that they'll repeat ad infinitum, the incredibly tiny variation in enemies (bandit, big bandit, dwarf bandit, dog thing, big dog thing, dwarf dog thing, etc.).

Then there's the fantastic groundbreaking art style...brown. Every shade of brown you can think of is in there, from light all the way up to a little darker brown.

The guns, millions of them, and each kind has basically two models just with dumb super soaker colors mixed in.

But wait there's also cool cars to drive...that all look the same, perform the same and steer like go-karts.

The awesome soundtrack consists of a looped country western thing that just plays endlessly.

Level scaling is off the charts, you will always be underleveled even if you do all side quests.

Quite possibly one of the most overrated games of all time. I really don't find the entertainment value in this game.

This game is simply boring and there is nothing fun about it."
202,i would gladly disembowel randy pitchford
203,"Pretty decent game with interesting locations and a lot of cool weapons.

Be aware though it has a crazy amount of bugs (that I have encountered anyway). Please bear in mind that you (and others) may have a completely different experience altogether. 

In spite of the bugs and heavy lag I found I still enjoyed it and still recommend it to a high degree.

P.S: Jakobs is the best manufacturer ;))))"

The whole look of it is so tiring, all that wasteland all the time, the NPCs are bland and the ending... Is rather famous. But I won't spoil anyway. Not worth the time.
 And the claptrap tries too hard to be funny, without being funny at all."

241,I love the gunplay and borderlands is awesome
242,"Absolutely mind-bogglingly boring shoot fest with no rhyme or reason to any of the gameplay. Fight, loot, analyze your loadout for 25,000 minutes to see if the loot you just collected to see if anything that dropped was ACTUALLY worth your time all the while completing piddly diddly sidequests, and that's the game. I don't like it but it isn't BAD necessarily. Just boring and tedious from the moment you drop in. Well, okay to be fair it's a few minutes AFTER you drop in that it gets boring.

Some positives though!
-good voice acting
-cool art style (just wish it wasn't dry deserted wasteland every time. I get it, Pandora is just a planet like that but still it's boring to look at and feels awful to be there. ESPECIALLY for long the game overstays its welcome.)
-gripping story!*
-bare minimum of functioning weapons that have a nice balance and progression over time

*that lil notch is what inspired me to complete this game. the story was very intriguing and I wanted to see where it would go, so I slogged through the gameplay. Watching the credits was extremely ironic, what with seeing the 8-9 people under the ""game design"" tab and yet still all those 8 brains could think of was the emptiest most bare bones kind of gameplay ever.

TL;DR - bad :) Maybe revolutionary at the time? But has not held up well. I'd love to say more about it, but that's what separates a BAD game from a BORING one. You don't even feel like talking about it, y'know?"
243,"I love this game a lot, have been playing it for many years. It's older, has some jank to it, but I think it's still a solid game to play. However expect bugs in multiplayer

Lilith and Mordi are easy mode"
244,"Awful game, The start of the game is fun and feels addictive. But the story is awful and the further you get into said story the more generic and uninspired the worlds and enemies get. 6.5/10"
245,"It's.. okay to say the least. The plot was kinda everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The setting can get boring at first but will become more interesting after the first areas and such. The gameplay though is good for the first installment. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you'll not. But it also inspired the developers to create a good sequel, so there's also that."

255,"First off there is an enhanced edition of this game, go get that one it looks better and has quality of life changes. Second if you are determined to also play this then play this before the enhanced edition as you will very much miss those changes. I only got in to the Borderlands series in 2022, and in short I am hooked. Not my normal go to game of choice but I am enjoying the art style, the game play (although very repetitive throughout), and the story. The writing for this game is fantastic and honestly some of the best writing I have experienced. That is not because the story is gripping or awe inspiring but the combination of perfectly written humour and external references make it a pleasure to experience. So much so I am also playing through it again with the enhanced edition."

(sometimes a common weapon is stronger than the legendary!!)

The funny thing is when you fight a strong enemy or boss (ex: his level is 36 and your level is same)
When you kill him, You say yeeea I will be rewarded! 
But You will get a weapon or shield of much lower level than you (maybe lvl25 or lower whereas your lvl is 36)!!

281,great comedy great style and great series overall
282,"It seems REALLY weird to even be saying these words, but the truth is that you're wasting your time with this game. 

Don't get me wrong: I had tons of fun with it in its time. THE original looter-shooter; how can you go wrong when the game had so many working parts from the get-go? Diverse classes, procedure-generated weaponry with unique and varied stats, fun things to shoot, not-awful driving sections, cool aesthetic, great sense of progression, strong ability to customize playstyle? All sounds great.

There are some BIG negatives that don't immediately appear to be even present. You spend far too much time in the first area. Going to a new area to only find yourself in another dusty plain (and never anything else) is discouraging. Enemies respawn too often, making going anywhere a chore. Not all classes are viable singleplayer. Not all skills are even noticeable moment to moment. Most guns are trash, and you feel like a highway cleanup crewman grabbing them to sell later. Backpack management is bad, comparing items is bad, etc.

None of this is a dealbreaker. It all just is minor annoyances that don't even ruin the overall package. What DOES ruin it is Borderlands 2. And Borderlands 3. And Tiny Tina DLC. And arguably Pre-Sequel. So many quality of life, diversification, world building, customization, and feature improvements were added in the sequel alone that it's just...hard to go back.

Play it if you want. I'd suggest playing it ahead of any other title in the series."

If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

286,Fuck yeah
287,"My first Borderlands experience, even though 2 was out when I played this one. The story that they laid out with this entry spawned numerous sequels that are just as fun and engaging as the OG. Would 100% recommend a play through even if you already played the rest of the series first - play the game that became a timeless classic in its own right. 

Gearbox/2K really nailed the looter-shooter formula with the Borderlands series. The gunplay is solid, the loot comes just often enough to keep you engaged, and the traversal of the world is fun if slow at times. Borderlands always seems to focus the game around having fun first and foremost without regard for anything else - its okay to have OP weapons, skills, abilities, etc. because being OP is F U N. The writing is funny most of the time and hilarious some of the time. The loop of killing question looting selling buying and repeat is difficult to mess up and Borderlands never fails to disappoint. Each entry in the series is like a candy bar: you know it will be good no matter what, but the new toppings that each successive candy bar gets makes it taste that much better. I 100% see myself playing Borderlands 17 in the nursing home. It's a Borderlands game, you know what you are getting into; play it if you are hooked like the rest of us, or don't."
288,THIS GAME IS A VERY COOL FPS WHERE YOU GOT TO KILL BOSSES AND FREAKS TO GET BETTER GEAR TO FINISH THE MISSIONS AND MAIN OBJECTIVES. PROVIDED ME WITH HOURS OF FUN AND THE MULTIPLAYER WORKED AMAZINGLY.
289,eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
290,More than a decade later this is still one of my favorite games.

303,fun but cant drive the car

i just loot my chest and win these games im not no loser man
hit the pump and take that loot and take off in a whiplash yea (vroom)"
314,"Really fun game.
Graphics are still nice, even to this day
I really like the cell shading effect everything has, it makes this game really stand out.
Just a nice ""run around doing quests and shooting stuff"" kind of game.
I also like how this game isn't very hardware demanding, my computer is shitty and I still get 60+ frames.
Pretty good game 7/10 I would highly recommend."
315,"Crazy game at the time of release. Classic now. 
In-game weapon look and feel great.
I like the comics-alike style, it somewhat conserves the graphic from getting old, in my opinion.
There is a lack of variety in the arsenal and locations, though.

About DLCs, The Secret Armory of General Knoxx and Claptrap's New Robot Revolution are some of the best DLCs I ever seen in my playing experience. 

P.S. Lilith is a beauty"

317,.
318,"A must play, tons of fun co op."
319,I wish these games were better
320,"Not a bad start, all things considered.  Don't expect the same level as Borderlands 2, but a decent experience.  My main complaints is how slow your character moves in relation to how large the maps are.  It's like the developers were intentionally trying to stretch the gameplay by making it take years to get from objective to objective."

326,It's amazing.
327,its a good loot shooter :D
328,"I've 100%'d this game on every single character on both playthroughs and yet I still don't feel bored of the game. The original Borderlands gives me a feeling no game has given me. The other games in the series are objectively better, but this game holds a special place in my heart for it's unique world and satisfying gameplay."
329,"Game design is a little aged at this point, gun generation isn't as satisfying as the later games but its still a fun time. I enjoyed my play-through enough to finish the whole game in a few days"
330,"good game, wasted my life killing claptraps

331,This is one of the few games I have laughed (a lot) while playing. The dark humor combined with leveling and looting keeps me coming back to play. Very fun!

335,Amazing game. Got the game done on ps3 years back so had to get it on pc. Still great.

337,"Absolutely wonderful game, this was the first PC game I ever played when my dad gave me his steam account and it basically made up my entire childhood."
338,"I came over from Borderlands 2 so some parts of the game especially the UI and key bindings and AI feels kinda dated but I can see why it was considered amazing back in the day. Would recommend buying on sale, playing with friends."
339,This game never gets old!  I have played through it with one friend and now starting it again with another.  Love the sarcastic humor throughout the gsme!
340,Man with anger issues
341,"Get it and play it. Not as good as Borderlands 2 imo, but definitely worth playing."
342,Bem divertido! :D
343,"Got this because I loved 2 on 360, I would recommend playing this before 2 other wise maybe skip it. 7/10"
344,"Honestly I liked the storytelling a lot better when it was a bit more serious and sincere like it was in borderlands 1, though, I don't actually dislike the funny maymays of the second game and the pre-sequel. I refuse to buy the 3rd game because I don't give a shit enough to support garbage.
The game itself is less than nothing special, because it's repetitive uninspired garbage with a poor loot system, and so it has been the entire time. With a half-decent and half-coherent story, it's given me quite a few chuckles and even straight up laughs, but would I want others to experience the same kind of trash grinding I did? No.

I personally don't even understand the appeal of grinding in garbage games with less than adequate mechanics and combat-feel (can you dodge, how is the movement, how do guns feel etc.) so excuse me for dropping a fat deuce on this hot piece of skag farts, but it ain't good joe, it never was.

Borderlands 1 suffers from giving you poor eyesight, so make sure to eat extra carrots."
345,"Had it on my xbox and it was on sale and i beat it this time. amazing game would recommend, it is better with the other games though"
346,"Great game and a fantastic way to kick off the series. I liked the second one more, but the story does flow from one to the next."
347,"Eh, id rather play one of the new installments"
348,funny comic book game
349,👍
350,"I really enjoyed this game in a way I haven't been able to enjoy any of its sequels or spinoffs. The game's troubled development is stamped all over it – vast empty generic environments taking the place of the procedural level generation that never panned out, a story told haltingly through illustrations and radio comms, tonal whiplash between austere atmospheric music and batshit over-the-top characterizations. All of these add together to become more than the sum of their parts, creating an experience somehow melancholy and zany, akin to the weirder bits of the Fallout games. Unfortunately, for all subsequent titles they discarded the quiet loneliness and doubled, tripled, quadrupled down on the zaniness – I just don't have the energy for all that. Still, I sometimes think back to the fond memories I have of Borderlands, and wonder if any other game will someday figure out a way to bottle that strange desolate deranged energy."

	[td]Borderlands always boasts a bunch of replayability. The 1st playthrough and then when you finish that you get True Vault Hunter Mode where enemies level scale higher which makes them more difficult, but at the same time you also get better (Legendary) loot. Borderlands consists of a 1st playthrough, 2nd playthrough, and a 2.5 playthrough.[/td]

	[td]Keep in mind that Borderlands was released in 2009 so this is just a remaster with 4K texture support, so it’s slightly cleaner and has all the DLC which adds 70 or so more missions which is a real bang for your buck, so if you’ve never played Borderlands I would recommend this as it currently at the date of writing has a -67% discount which is a bargain for the 60-100 hours playtime you get out of it. And if you have had the pleasure of purchasing Borderlands before on steam in its heyday, the enhanced edition should already be in your library so what are you waiting for xD. [b]GO NOW[/b][/td]

[/table]

🎮[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]
Have you ever wanted to roam the wasteland of Pandora being able to deploy a mini turret to have your back in a sticky situation?, Or maybe you prefer the long-distance patient approach and just want to pick off your enemies from a distance with your trusty eagle compadre? Perhaps being able to move through other dimensions and disappear from the enemies’ line of sight to create some distance while electrocuting them and leaving a trail of fire like a phoenix from behind is more your speed? Or even getting up close and personal with fists as powerful as steel to demolish your enemies with a smile on your face. The thing about Borderlands back in 2009 and even today is that it provided a bunch of gameplay variations with minimal consequence.

Borderlands is a story-based game however anybody who’s played it can agree that you get a lot more immersed in the combat, gunplay, and character upgrades than the story. But, just to briefly touch on the story without giving you any spoilers. You begin on a bus and you have to pick one of four characters, shortly after that you learn of a vault with alien technology and secrets. And in a nutshell that’s pretty much it. What follows is you taking on a bunch of main quests, side-quests, a couple of Boss battles, and you’ll even meet a couple of memorable NPC’s. You level up and get rewarded with upgrade points which can be used in 3 separate categories which essentially are 3 different types of playstyles, so if you look at it like this you have 4 characters who can do up to 3 playthroughs who each have 3 different skill trees which mean 3 different playstyles per character. 

💥[b][u]Weapons[/u][/b]
Let’s get to the real meat and potatoes that are Borderlands.[b]GUNS[/b]. Every time I decide to invest another 20 hours of my life into Borderlands which I’ve done a couple of times I am astounded by the sheer variety of guns that can be used. Repeater pistols (automatic), Revolvers, SMGs, Combat Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, Rocket Launchers, and a special class called Eridian weapons. 

✅[b][u]Missions[/u][/b]
With 126 missions being separated into 46 story missions and the remaining 80 as side missions, there will always be something to do as you traverse Pandora. Missions will reward you with experience points, money, and sometimes weapons that are exclusive to the completion of that mission. And then if you factor in the 4 DLC it bumps the total mission number up to 216 missions!

The only downside to these astonishing 216 missions is that eventually, the missions can become repetitive, and it is to be expected with a game of this magnitude. A couple of times you will realize that this mission is the same as that mission just with a different name. The great thing about Borderlands is that it does feature 4 play drop-in and drop-out multiplayer so to alleviate this tediousness maybe jump on with a couple of friends and go exploring together because more friends equal tougher enemies and tougher enemies equal better loot! 

💣[b][u]Multiple Playthroughs[/u][/b]
A feature that Borderlands was ahead of its time for was the functionality of additional playthroughs and its benefits. Once you complete the game on your first playthrough if you completed all of the story missions and side missions your character should be level 34 and it is at this point where if you select start game with the same character you will begin at the beginning again but with all the same gear you had as well as abilities and your level will remain at 34. The enemies level will now be scaled from 34 up until 48 which means enemies pose more of a challenge than before but with a higher chance of dropping better loot.

[b][u]Randomization[/u][/b]
So, if you’ve ever played Diablo you’ll know a thing or two about its item randomization system. Well, Borderlands makes use of the same kind of concept because every time you open a weapons chest its outcome is randomized out of the 17750000 weapons, shield, grenade mod, or artifact possibilities. So trying to find legendary or pearlescent weapons on your first playthrough is really like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

🎬[b][u]Visuals[/u][/b]
Borderlands has always been a very appealing game since it goes against the norm of conventional game design by using cell-shaded graphics, which gives it a very cartoonish comic feel which for most is nostalgic, and where most games that have used this same approach have tried and failed, Borderlands use of it has always been at the top of the list.

🎵[b][u]Sound/Music/Voice[/u][/b]

Borderlands has some really clean sound effects in pretty much every avenue, that’s to be expected from a triple-A developer. Weapon firing sounds clean, Elemental effects like incinerating enemies or especially when corrosive is being used the fizzing and bubbling sounds so realistic. Which adds to the immersion of the whole experience.

📃[b][u]Pros and Cons[/u][/b]
[b][u]Pros[/u][/b]

●	Tons of replayability
●	Graphics held up over so many years, still looks great 
●	Enemies scale to harder difficulty every time you replay the game
●	Amazing randomized loot and weapon system
●	Great crossplay multi-player compatibility
●	Lots of interesting enemy variation

[b][u]Cons[/u][/b]

❖	Missions can become tedious with there being a total of 216 missions.

☁[b][u]Final Thoughts[/u][/b]
Overall Borderlands is one of those titles where you get so much more than what you expect, a reason to replay it over and over, a randomized loot system to keep everything fresh, a vast amount of enemy types, and boss battles that will undoubtedly test your skill and overall a pretty good story.

Rating: 8.5/10

352,"This product contains more empty space than essential content due to the fact that the development team were aspiring to hook players on a series of DLCs, zany characters, and the multitude of side quests that are often lacking in variety and or fulfilment. Much like the original version of ""Borderlands"", it is a difficult video game to enjoy for those seeking uniquity coupled with replayability (especially a decade later)."
353,TERRIBLE GAME
354,"One of my favorite games ever but still leaving a negative review solely because of Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot DLC. Jesus Christ, what were they thinking?"
355,Fuck Randy Bitchford and 2K.
356,"Grab it if you are new to the franchise.

It is still the old school FSP game that will run on almost anything and provide you and three others a weekend of fun like it was back in 2009. The memory leaks are still there, the load freeze for non-hosting players still remain, but remains a great game for entertainment and co-op goodness.

Seeing as this is not the enhance version, a lot of effort could have been thrown to fix the old bugs – so for that reason make sure to get it on specials.
"
357,"How have I not reviewed this yet?! 
It's Borderlands! Of course I recommend it! Stomping through Pandora with a few mates, shooting baddies in the head with all kinds of awesome weapons? Heck yea!
If you haven't already put hundreds of hours into this game then you're missing out!"

Not my favorite Borderlands in the series, but its worth playing if you are a fan and want to see the origins. Whats great about this game is that you really don't have to look at any guides to make great builds that decimate your foes. Unfortunately, the game doesn't really feel like its worth coming back too often due to the lack of a story and grindy side quests that have you collecting gun pieces or blowing the same thing up in a different location. Would recommend if you're a fan, would not recommend if you're unsure of Borderlands and want to enter the universe for the first time."
360,"The OG for a fun franchise, sure you've heard someone talkin about it. easy 9 at time of release but solid 7.5 now with how much more visually pleasing the new games are"
361,ye
362,"This is were the Original Borderlands story begins and what a tale it was.
8/10"
363,good
364,"Fun game, but honestly, just play Borderlands 2 instead"
365,"Great game, can't really complain as this was one of my first introductions into loot and shoots and I continued into BL2 and pre-sequel. I'd highly recommend playing BL, then BL2, then Pre-sequel, and if you really want BL3. If you play BL2 and get used to being able to save and quit and return to the exact spot you left, you'll hate BL because you'll have to complete whatever you're doing in one sitting or be reset to the main area of that DLC or map.
"
366,GUD GAME!!
367,psycho is so hot
368,Excellent all around shoot and loot. Bug and lag free!
369,Yay
370,I'm very aware of the flaws that make this game seem dated. Did that stop me from sinking nearly two hundred hours across consoles and computers? No.
371,"Didn't plan on coming back to Borderlands 1 or PreSequel, but I thought about it. I've tried/beat every COD, Battlefield, and Halo. So might aswell finish this series aswell"
372,graphics are bit dated but its a fun game with endless amounts of re-playability
373,.
374,Shoot in a face. Face goes *Splat* Good game.
375,"do you have a cool friends to play with?

then this is a must to play game for you !!!!
"
376,"I'll start this review by saying this is (in my opinion) my favorite borderlands game, despite being basically all the shit aspects of every borderlands game mashed into one and sent back in time to remind us how far borderlands has come.

I won't make this as long as my borderlands 3 review where I'll eventually need to make a youtube video to just summarize my thoughts but basically, this game has not only the most nonsense story you've ever seen, and this is coming from somehow who HATES BL3's story, trust me I came into this game knowing the story is shit and I can let it pass because of BL2's existence, and the gunplay is mediocre at best, while it does contain my favorite looking weapons in BL franchise (especially the revolvers), it also contains alot of charm that was lost a little bit in BL2, and mostly lost in BL3. The only reason I bothered playing this game was just because of how much charm it has, for a 2009 game that's almost older than alot of people I know (Excuse me I'm 15, not exactly the type to like old games but shush), and is easily the most fun for seasoned veterans for BL2 like me. I loved this game but I acknowledge that if your new, do NOT start with this game. Try BL2 or BL3 depending on your preferences, but if your already experienced with BL2 and BL3, BL1 is not bad to go back too, just skip moxxi's underdome DLC if you wish to have any braincells left, and no thats not a joke, I'm being serious, if you ever wanted to see what the cistern of slaughters or whatever got inspired from (the ones from BL3), this is where the '5 waves in a round, complete 5 rounds' concept comes from and its even worst here, you have been warned..."
377,"So, went back and played the entire game for the first time.  Uh... it's fine, but I wouldn't have... spent money on it? The story is practically non-existent, honestly just play Borderlands 2 instead.  Start from there.  I thought I was missing out, like with the final boss and whatnot, but... nope! Give this one a pass, and play Borderlands 2, Pre-Sequel, and Borderlands 3 instead.  It's not... exactly a BAD game? It's just... I don't know.  It's too far in the future for it, now.  We have better versions of it.  Gearbox did a fantastic job improving basically everything about the game in BL2, so just buy BL2."
378,"Had a ROUGH learning curve. Friend and I kept dying rather easily until we got to around level 10. Overall, a fun game to play with friends. I sadly got too attached to my turret and miss it in the other games."
379,"[Controls]

The aiming in this game feels terrible. It's the second game in my life I have seen a ""grid"" aiming system and sniping is one of the worst experience ever.. 

It's pretty hard to explain, but let say you need to move your aim 0.37 unit to right. The game is only capable to move with a precision of 0.1 unit, so you are basically missing the 0.07 unit you needed to land this headshot.

I'm assuming they made the game for consoles, then ported it to PC without really focusing on the controls.

[Story]

Another point I didn't like was the lack of voice acting for most of the quests.

I'm kinda lazy and I don't really like reading paragraphs of text...

But except for that, the story was good :3


[Conclusion]

The game lacks polishment, but the enhanced edition fix a lot of my issues. So I recommend playing it instead of the original ^-^

(Sorry for bad english)"
380,Very good.
381,its great
382,"i love loot and u should too
"
383,cum
384,this game is still one of the best that i have ever played so i suggest playing this game and even the other ones
385,"I wanna give this a positive review, I really do, but this just isn't good to today's standards unless you modify it, and I don't give a rating to a game based off mods. If you are willing to modify the game to be at a higher FOV and fix various issues, then sure go for it. But fixes like the FOV don't even work if you aren't hosting/playing singleplayer, they will just constantly reset. Playing this game at its base 56 FOV is honestly so painful, I struggled to play without eye strain and mild motion sickness.

I recommend you play the Enhanced edition, as it fixes these issues for the most part, bar in mind you don't care that the game now has Golden Chest and some other tweaks."
386,Fun game but it gets a bit boring and slugish. The DLC are fun but in 2022 I would not recommend anyone buying this product.
387,This game is a TIMELESS CLASSIC
388,"For someone that wants to try something older with a serious tone to the Borderlands series, it is a good game. Definitely not aged well since it was 2009, but it holds value to play and see what the game started from.

If you are coming from the BL2/BL3 experience or want to 100% this game and DLC, I do NOT recommend this game.

BL1 is missing all the QOL features that BL2 has. Missing things like a minimap, easy way to compare weapon stats, the ability to back track levels, the need for fast travels, marking favorite weapons, easier way to check quests/objectives. Just simple stuff you would expect while traversing this game.

The bad part is the amount of backtracking needed to get things 'done' around for quests. Even worse, the maps are huge which makes travel time annoying. Especially when it is forced to travel using a vehicle.

Achievements are awful ridden with CONTENT! Making you grind for multiple quest parts that can take couple of hours per DLC. Or the underdome for at least 10 hours of zzzzzzzzzzz.

Lastly, to have 'fun' you really need to powerhouse the entire game/dlc/levels to get the proper gear and guns to be overpowered. Meanwhile, you can stay strong anytime during BL2/BL3. Gear dependencies are forced, unless you are playing Siren... which is the strongest character lol

One positive to put is the game does have the humor elements while keeping the serious atmosphere with cool characters. But the story isn't the best to look forward. 
Another positive I can say was the last DLC of the Claptrap Robolution. But you'd have to go through the pain of the other DLCs to understand that part of the story."
389,"so you want to hear a story, eh?"
390,play higher version of this game borderland 3
391,Good!
392,its great
393,The game that started it all.
394,"A little old now, but this was one of my favorite games.  I've played it through multiple times, including the 4 DLCs.  It was something different in its day.  Not just running around shooting things.  Gathering up loot, shopping for better weapons.  It would have been nice to be able to upgrade weapons and items.  But, still worth playing."
395,"I am a huge Borderlands fan, have played every single one of them and recently me and a group of friends beat this game (the first time for them, but not for me of course). I can say for sure that this game WAS a good game, and that it has aged quite badly compared to what I consider the golden child of looter shooters Borderlands 2. My overall enjoyment with this game wasn't as high as I remember it being as a kid, and I think nostalgia is the only reason I can see myself going back to it.

Pros
The first of an amazing series
The DLC is probably worth spending time on

Cons
Almost every area feels the exact same and doesn't look that great
The guns are not that creative compared to 2 or 3
The characters are not all that interesting and I think the difference in usefulness is too high

TLDR: Good game for the time, not anymore"
396,👍
397,"The start of the Borderlands series, a fantastic game well worth the praise it receives. Has good replay value, and is great solo or with friends"
398,good game.
399,ok
400,8/10
401,Very fun if you and your friends are looking for a fun little multiplayer game.
402,Well I'm not much for compliments but... you did fine.
403,great game graphics looks good even if its not the enhanced version
404,borderlands 2 is shit in comparison
405,: )
406,borderlands? more like boring lands
407,"much fun, such loot"
408,still the best borderlands
409,"I completely recommend this game for any variety of gamers. This game is absolutely fantastic ranging from its unique style for graphics, or its compact story line. This game will pull you in with interest and you wont ever want to stop playing. This game has all sorts of different things you can do from finishing the story, doing a vastly large amount of side missions, or farm and attempt to find the very rare and powerful gear. This is one game I will never forget, neither will you. 10/10 COMPLETELY Recommended game."

411,Oh boy do I love this game. This was one of my first shooter games. The humor is amazing and I love the characters and soundtrack. I keep coming back to these games and always recommend them to others.
412,Absolutely smashing game. Better off buying Borderlands 2 though still :)
413,"Its a lot of fun, good gameplay, great story. Its all around worth the buy, if youve played the other games and liked them then you'll like this."
414,"Not a fan of Gearbox at all, but this is -the- game that got me. It's a pity that my CD copy died on me, I almost saw it as a friend back then."
415,"THIS is what playing a Borderlands game should feel like !
PS.their ""enhanced"" version is more like Dehanced but kudos maybe some ppl liked it."
416,"I'm on the fence on this one. I did have loads of fun with it, a solid looter-shooter easy to get into without complicated mechanics. Basically, run or drive around, blow up shit, collect more shit, rinse and repeat. Interesting story, funny dialogue, some interesting side quests.

However, it is not without issues, some of these are:
- retarded enemy respawn. after clearing an area of enemies, later on they will respawn, but their level will not scale, so it's just an annoyong drag to clear them again, waste of time
- boring loot. and by boring I mean boooooriiiiing yaaawwwwn. I mean I ran about 2/3 of the game with the same shotgun. Never found anything significantly superior to what I already had
- inventory system sucks ass big time
- some of the side quests are just boring and useless, especially the ones requiring to get different weapon parts. why?
- dumbed down and uninteresting skills tree, nothing seems to have a major impact

Bottom line, it's a mindless looter-shooter, but a good one. Just don't expect any ""wow this legendary gun is the shit"" moments."
417,"I really enjoyed playing this game few years ago,and its still a great game to this day."
418,"Great gameplay, awesome characters, loads of zaniness, tons of fun. Favorite DLC: The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned."
419,Fyrestone is home to me.
420,its cool
421,"Ahh, Borderlands 1. I bought this game on steam after trying out BL3 and being disappointed, so I decided to revisit this old classic to wash the bitter taste away. I clocked in hundreds of hours on this game on console, and I'm glad to say it still holds up after all of this time, and is easily my favorite game in the series.

BL1 has the best looting gameloop out of all of the games by far, and is easily its biggest selling point. Every area and point of interest has chests to open up, making exploration and doing quests so much fun since you'll always be rewarded no matter what you do. Even BL2 fell short in this regard. BL2 started a bad trend in mainly giving chests and loot to players after they kill a story relevant boss. The only reason to do quests in BL2 and 3 is to get EXP and sometimes quest-specific guns or equipment. The replay value suffers significantly from this as it feels like everything takes a back seat to the main story, which actually lets you fight things with good loot and take a chance at a chest or two. Despite some of its jank, BL1 is still fun even after all of the hours I put into it because it is the only game that encourages me to explore and find cool stuff in every nook and cranny of its world. Highly recommend for its perfectly addictive gameplay loop, good progression with lots of unique guns, and generally just a fun story and world to sink your teeth into.

Just someone for the love of god teach me how to change the FOV please, I think I might get sick."

439,"this game is worse than borderlands 2, yet i like it more than borderlands 2"
440,"Same tier as borderlands 2 for its time. 10/10 all round other than the FOV stuck at 90, which you can fix."
441,good
442,its pretty fun
443,everything just feels like grinding so you can do more grinding. not really that fun in my opinion.
444,Solid game all around.
445,Really good if you're a fan of the formula or have friends.  I am oddly burnt out and cannot enjoy it.  4/10
446,"very nice, I like"
447,"One of the best games ever made, even if it is crazy janky

Definitely recommend to uncap framerate (game defaults to 60)
And FOV (75 default or something terrible like that)"
448,epic
449,"yes borderlands, a classic"
450,Always a great time with friends.
451,"The same borderlands that I loved playing on my Xbox, and now love playing on my PC. While I didn't have all the DLC for the console, it wasn't necessary, and was a nice to have, it's definitely a plus and adds to the game play. This is a cult classic shoot and loot game, now three games into the series, and a rumor that there's a fourth in the works.

This is a must play just for kicks, and has lots of replay value even in solo mode... but pick it up on sale."

453,neat
454,it cool
455,Nice :)
456,"It's okay, bring some friends and play it for a few nights. You'll probably not particularly like a lot of the engine jank, but the game's solid for its time."
457,fun asf bro
458,Game that started the Borderlands series. To be honest the game has not aged well. If smooth combat is important to you then Borderlands 3 is a better game to play. While characters make appearances in the following games this game really isn't required to enjoy the other 2.

460,I have enjoyed playing this game and sure im streaming it but boy its nastlgic

464,It's a good game.
465,This game is such a fun shooter especially with friends. it's a very creative setting for a game with lots of cool things to explore. would recommend buying!
466,"Played this with a friend of mine. Wasn't too big of a fan of the game when I played it on my own some years ago, but definitely had a blast & got addicted to it for the time we played it. Also sometimes played for like 5-6 hours straight. Amazing game deserving of its reviews."

474,old but gold <3
475,amazing
476,Best Borderlands ever!!!
477,One of the best game!
478,"It looks amazing on any p.c. and its a timeless classic. When your playing with friends, its like a good LAN party. The progression of leveling once you've maxed out your character is nothing short of fantastic because you always have something to do and the progression is like Diablo 3 where you have to grind for that special weapon."
479,"Great game, used to play this game with my brother all the time when we were little. <3"
480,"I love this the bot  claptrap is so funny and cute in a way. gun controls are good and the people you have to fight have great designs. Great game, recommend all day long."
481,great game
482,"As someone who does not primarily play shooters or first person shooters it's really fun and unique game with lot's of charm with it's art style and humour as well as it's good gun play and good character progression and rpg elements. However the game can be repetitive as the gameplay formula stays the same throughout from the beginning to the end there are countless samey fetch quests, kill em quests, collect quests, do A and B quests etc and there are hundreds of them with the only variation being locations and enemies but these mentioned quests are optional and does not need to be done to be able to enjoy the game.

Overall a really solid looter shooter and it is a lot of fun with character builds and bazillion different guns."
483,old but good
484,If you haven't played it....PLAY IT!  Its just fun!
485,"it's fine, but come on, just play 2."
486,"Great game always loved since ps3, just a shame I was unable to get the enhanced version to run on my laptop :/ this version is ace though!"
487,"Play the enchanced version
Please. 
I had to do so much in the text edit file to get this game going smoothly. Unplayable without forced vsync."
488,The birthplace of the modern loot shooter.  A blast to play and it introduces you to the characters and lore that the rest of the series caries forward.
489,p good.
490,I played this when it came out in 2008 still enjoy the game
491,"This is Genesis, the originator of the loot shooter.  Ya like RPGs?  Ya like FPS?  Well, Borderlands gives them both to you at one low, low price.  Makes Destiny look like a turd pile."
492,Buy the remaster
493,Great game.
494,cheese
495,2 is better
496,:D
497,i like it
498,realy good game play 97 hour
499,"Not as good as BL2, but still a great game. challenging boses, great story and some bas ass weapons. If you like to shoot and loot then this is the game for you."
500,I blame this game for where we're at now
501,"After years of owning this game and putting 59 hours into the game I finally decided to beat it. I was already level 28 so I was only around 2 hours from beating the game. I always seemed to quit the game around the same time every time I tried beating it. After now beating it though I feel like I can give an actual review and say I recommend it. I could already say that before but I wanted to see the game play out. I'm not gonna lie the ending was lackluster at best. The final boss fight was disappointing, the loot from the boss itself was disappointing and I never really was hooked onto the story to begin with. But what got me hooked was pandoras world and the gameplay itself being so addictive. I'd 100% say this game was worth it because even the story being kinda shit this game was a 8-9/10 for me, and hey if u like the story, even better for you. If you haven't played or beat this game yet, go for it, You won't regret it."
502,"Loot, shoot, harvest, repeat."
503,this is one of my all time favorite games. I love the whole story line.
504,a certified classic. 10/10
505,"Gameplay is fun but the thing that makes it repetitive is the annoying leveling that you have to do before every campaign mission. The story is bad, the fact that you meet the main villain in the i think 5th last mission is just terrible. The gameplay will keep you playing but if you want a good story game then i suggest to just play Borderlands 2 because that shits amazing, and this game isn't connected to it at all besides from the characters returning they don't reference the first one pretty much at all."
506,seru
507,"tip to starters: if ur getting frustrated its not hard if u just do the side quests when needed. don't try to force your way through story if it says the mission is ""tough"" difficulty. just doing side missions and going back to story once its ""normal"" difficulty is how i made the most fun with the game. doesn't make it super easy, it just makes it more how it was intended, challenging and hard but not: every mediocre skag can two shot you"
508,a
509,"I recommend this game to people that like to kill people, but in a more violent way, like a gore way."
510,i had fun.

513,good game but i have a meh computer
514,"Great game, played it first on the playstation and than on PC. Fun to play and very rewarding. Each class has it's uniquenesses which change the gameplay and make it worth replaying again with someone else just to catch the nuances it has for every character."
515,Yes.
516,"Its slow in the start sure but once you actually get going then it starts getting better. I'd say its almost a survival FPS in the start, health is in short supply, ammo also. Once you get your first class mod and start moving it does get faster"
517,Man I love the Borderlands series!!!
518,"I started Borderlands on Xbox 360 with this game and still enjoy returning for nostalgia. Enjoyable, grindy, not too hard, a little rough on the gameplay but it's aged like wine to me."
519,very good game just old and takees alot of storage up
520,"While it lacks some of the polish that BL2 has, Borderlands is still amazing. Picking it up again after some years away, I'm finding it difficult to stop playing. Great game. Still worth getting.

There are tweaks you may want to use. FOV defaults to 70, and has no setting in game. It's not hard to find info about it. But some filenames have changed. I recommend this guide in 2021. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVg0CPyaoqg

Linux/Proton users (at least those on Debian-based distros): The file to edit is ~/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/Borderlands/Engine/Config/BaseInput.ini

I personally prefer to use middle mouse to change FOV to 100, as every time you exit a vehicle, vending machine, etc., FOV goes back to 70. It's quick and easy to click the mouse wheel whenever I realize my FOV is jacked again. The line to add in the [Engine.PlayerInput] section is: Bindings=(Name=""MiddleMouseButton"",Command=""FOV 100"",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)

Be mindful of keybind conflicts."
521,Goodshit
522,"best in the franchise. it's true, consecutive entries have polished the mechanics, but the original maintains a bleak, harsh, uncaring tone that its sequels have forgone in favour of camp"
523,This game scratches an itch.
524,Yes
525,"Borderlands. This one is a bit hard for me to review since I played it so long ago, but let's see.

I think that the gameplay is the most important feature for a game like Borderlands. Sure you do have a story and that cool art style, but the gameplay is what kept me playing this game.

So how is the gameplay then? It's good. Movement and shooting are perfect for the type of game Borderlands is. Opening all the boxes hoping to find a better gun was always fun. The maps felt open and free to explore, but also not overwhelming which I like.

Fighting never got boring too. It didn't matter at what point I was in the game, the enemies always felt hard to kill, but not too hard to where it becomes boring. Good balance on that part.

And I cannot skip the fact that this game has a really good Co-Op. Playing with others is always better and Borderlands makes it really easy.

So what about the graphics of Borderlands. It is definitely a cool style which I really like. Even though the game is quite old they didn't feel bad at all. Of course, some areas could look better, but I'd say that the graphics of Borderlands are the type that doesn't age. They looked nice back when the game was released and they look nice today.

I don't have a lot to say about the story of the game. I didn't really focus too much on it when I played it. I do remember that it wasn't bad, but for me, at least the focus was on the gameplay.

So is Borderlands worth it? At the time of writing this review Borderlands 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, and Borderlands 3 are available. Go for those games if you just want to play a bit and have fun. I'd still recommend Borderlands 1 for the ones that are wondering if they should play all the games in the series. It is worth it."
526,"Not worth in 2021. Navigation is garbage. Loot is garbage. Gameplay is meh. It is looter-shooter and you will have hard time finding ammo.  Some times you will shoot enemy from point blank and it will do negligible damage . Accuracy is worst than WW1 games. You will not get satifaction of hitting headshots in this game. Sometimes you will never know where to find things by looking at its garbage navigation. For a simple thing that you would will be able to do in 10 sec will take hours because you never know at which level the item is.

TLDR:; Borderlands 2 is worth it, but this is trash in 2021."
527,it is just a great game
528,"A classic that still runs on Windows 10 and plays on computers from the early 2010's.  If you like to run and gun, enjoy dark humor, and don't have any interest in forking over $2,000 for just about any level graphics card (in late 2021) for today's new title releases, this is the perfect game to settle (back) into whether you've played it before or not."
529,"A fantastic shooter/RPG mix that essentially defined the 'genre' of looter-shooter. Despite it's 3 sequels, it still stands above them in one key area - the atmosphere/setting. It's hard to describe but if you've played this and the any of the sequels I think you'll know what I mean. If you liked any of the sequels, you're sure to enjoy this one as well. And if you've never played Borderlands before I would highly recommend to give it a shot, even if you're not normally a fan of shooters."
530,borberlanbs
531,banger fr
532,Better than the enhanced. Because it works.
533,i liked the custom weapon unpredictablilty. and playing with out people.
534,"Such a fun classic game, runs better than the enhanced version without the memory leak issue from the enhanced, too bad there's no minimap."
535,yes
536,"The sequels to Borderlands 1 have improved over this game by a LOT. But even years later this game still holds up great. The gunplay is fantastic, just getting loot feels great, the writing is more serious but still the classic Borderlands style people have fallen in love with. Driving around feels great and some of the guns and bosses still feel really memorable and fun to grind.

Some of the things that didn't carry over as well are just how bland some of the game feels nowadays. The environments and enemies all feel really similar, the classes don't have a lot of build variety and the skill trees are really boring and the guns are much more basic compared to some of the later entries. Lastly the side quest are REALLY simple, much more then I remembered, there are some exceptions but almost all the side quests boil down to kill these enemies or collect a couple of collectibles and then come back.

Its Borderlands at its most basic but that isn't always bad. It gets right what it needs to get right (guns) and its a quick and fun enough experience that it still feels like it has its place. Its a fantastic entry point into the series and still manages to differentiate itself from the competitors/sequels due to how good the execution of the basics are here. Its consistent in all that it does and short enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome, the dlc adds enough end game to keep it fresh after beating the game and add some unique and fun places to farm and grind."
537,I personally cannot play this game but you go ahead. It's alright
538,NOICE!
539,Roland Gaming
540,More time sorting loot than playing the actual game.
541,If borderlands is such a good game how come there isn't a borderlands 2? oh wait...
542,slow to start with but eventually got into the swing of things. would have preferred extra abilities like climbing
543,"Great humor, lovely graphics style, lengthy."
544,A good game but the second Borderlands in better.
545,it gud
546,really fun game to casually play after work or on the weekends. never a dull moment
547,"[h1]7/10[/h1]

[i]It makes little or no sense to compare this to BL2 as the latter is superior in (almost?) every aspect.
I first played BL1 when it was the only Borderlands installment, though, so I still have some nostalgic feelings towards it. I can highlight the game's post-apocalyptic atmosphere, a nice soundtrack, and the great Knoxx DLC (feels specifically good if you actually happen to kill Crawmerax).
As for the cons, it's where The Underdome (2nd DLC) and Claptrap's Robolution's grindy achievements pop up. Absolutely lame, awful, dull. The former might even be the worst DLC ever made. Who on Earth assumed that making a several hours long, repetitive, and frustrating arena was a good idea?[/i]"
548,so many memories of messin around on this game with my friends on the 360. classic
549,is fairly good

557,"[h1] TLDR: 8/10 Gameplay great, graphics still great, story is serviceable. [/h1]

[b] Actual Review (no spoilers): [/b] I guess it’s about time I review this series. The Borderlands franchise means a lot to me, and I pretty much owe it all to Steam giving me a free trail of Borderlands 2 in 2014, otherwise I probably would have been turned off to this franchise entirely just because of the art style (which I’ve grown to adore now). I’ve lost count of how many playthroughs I’ve had in total, the Borderlands formula just has very high replayablility inherently. 

The franchise has humble beginnings in BL1, serving as a mad max style looter shooter with gameplay and “the grind” at the forefront of everything. The story honestly takes a back seat for almost the entire game and really just serves the purpose of having to go to new areas, collect new items, and meet new characters, which is great. The story is literally just the “quest to find treasure” trope, but since this game pushes finding loot so heavily it makes the story feel less cliche and a natural part of the borderlands world. The actual interesting story elements aren’t the overarching plot, but the characters you meet and their arcs you see develop after the base game through the dlcs. Scooter and TK Baha for example have great development through the game and nice arcs when you play the respective dlcs with their inclusion. But I think everyone knows that Borderlands isn’t about story at its core.

Let’s talk about gameplay. I think it’s safe to say that the Borderlands franchise is THE looter shooter, and BL1 sets up the gameplay loop and the formula nicely that the later games are able to optimize and improve upon. As far as BL1 though? The gameplay still holds up very well. Sure it’s not as refined as the later games, but it almost never detracts from the fun of any given playthrough. If you’re a newcomer and playing this game first instead of bl2 like most fans probably did, you won’t even notice any issues. BL1 blends rpg elements with an fps setting and mechanics nicely, each of the four vault hunter classes are unique with their own sets of skill trees and weapon synergies. The weapons themselves don’t stray too far from the traditional roles of weapons: shotguns, pistols, snipers, etc. that is until you start getting legendaries to drop. Legendaries in BL1 are in my opinion, more well balanced than in any of the other games. Why? Well partly because of the lower level cap of level 69, so most legendaries are still viable during endgame content since each game is all balanced around the vanilla level cap of 50, but also because BL1 has the least legendaries so there’s more of a chance each will shine. I say MOST because there are a couple that are just bad regardless. And most of the other non-legendary unique gear is just above average gear of whatever it’s rarity happens to be, unless of course you somehow get a hybrid weapon to drop.

Outside of the weapons and gear, the combat is fun and fair, definitely far more simple than the later games, but there’s a certain charm that comes with that simplicity, and you can still rack some stupid high levels of damage with a good enough build. The quest structures themselves aren’t really anything to write home about and most are either kill/collect quests, which is unfortunate cause the way level scaling works in this game basically requires you to do most side missions to gain enough xp to keep up with the increase of enemy levels through the game. Thankfully though there are quests that yield either unique gear, or farmable items like the weapon forging missions which you can get legendaries from.

Lastly I gotta talk about the world itself. The map designs and environments are really top notch for what the setting of the game is. I know a lot of people’s biggest gripe of the first game is that it was all too desert wasteland repetition and not enough other environments (until the ending quarter of the game) but honestly I love the environments. Sure they’re the least complex and detailed in the series since it’s a 2009 game, but they really are able to immerse you into the world and are large enough to be explored regardless. Though that isn’t as rewarded as it is in the later games, it’s still really fun. There are bandit camps and enemies in every corner of the maps for you to find. And the music really adds to the immersion strangely enough. It’s more ambient than actual music except the combat music, which is why it doesn’t really get repetitive.

This game isn’t without its fair share of issues and bugs however. There’s some bugs that affect certain skills and class mods, as well as some legendaries not displaying as legendary rarity. Thankfully they aren’t really issues that plague your everyday experience with a playthrough unless you’re aware beforehand that they exist and what specifically is bugged and you directly look out for them. Some bugs have been patched, some were fixed for the enhanced edition, others will probably be in the vanilla game for the rest of time. Had it not been for the fact Borderlands as a whole has a very active modding community I’d say this is more of an issue than it actually is considering a lot of stuff you can patch yourself with mods with relative ease.

Overall BL1 is definitely a quality experience, learning how to build your character and what works the best with your current gear is really rewarding. Environmental design is great if not a tad repetitive in a few areas, and the replayability is basically infinite. I'd give this game a 9/10 were it not for the fact that the later games in the series showed me just how much further the Borderlands formula can go and be improved upon, but this first entry continues to stand on its own two feet very well. 8/10"

559," The Attack of the Dead Men was a battle of World War 1 that took place at Osowiec fortress (now northeast Poland), on August 6, 1915. At the beginning of July the German empire launched a full frontal assault on Osowiec fortress.  The attack included 14 battalions of infantry, one battalion of sappers, 24–30 heavy siege guns, and 30 batteries of artillery equipped with poison gases led by field marshal Paul Von Hindenburg. Inside of the osowiec fortress were 500 Russian soldiers and 400 malita men. The German strategy was to sweep through northern Poland to allow for the southern forces to focus on the south alone it was a divide and conquer. At dawn, at 4:00 a.m. on August 6, 1915, with a tailwind on the entire front of the attack, chlorine was released from 30 gas-balloon batteries. It is estimated that the gas eventually penetrated to a total depth of 20 km, maintaining the striking effect to a depth of 12 km and up to 12 meters in height. The siege lasted another 3 days not anticipated by the German army. Out of the around 900 men in the fortress there were about 100 men left. The movies don't really do chlorine gas much justice. They either greatly exaggerate it or they under sell it to shit. Acute exposure to chlorine gas can lead to nausea, vomiting, chest pain, retina scarring, and hearing loss. And keep in mind that's acute exposure the Russians in the fortress were exposed to severe gas for 3 days. Well back to it, where was i oh right so you got these Russians almost all of em are dead noone is uninjured so they all get in a huddle and go “Look friends i know the world looks scary right now and were about to die but we can it a lot worse” and make it worse they did. Knowing that all of them were about to die since everyone had been exposed to the gas, the Russians thought hey what if we just grabbed all the guns we could find and ran at them and that's what they did the balls on those guys. However the number of guns the Russians could find vary from source to source but the majority say that there were only about 40 or so guns left so we’ll roll with that. The next day on June 14th the Germans with their 7,000 soldiers went right up to the fortress expecting little resistance when they met the remaining soldiers. The state of the remaining Russians was so terrifying that the German army ran away. They were so terrified at the sight of the Russians standing there covered in blood and rotting flesh. The Russians saw them retreat and were like hey let's go kill those guys. They advanced on the retreating Russians firing their guns as they coughed up blood and their skin fell off reports state that one Russian started flying shooting lasers out of his eyes until he turned into a bald eagle and became a true patriot that's why the U.S’s symbol is a bald eagle because they were so terrified out of respect they turned him into the bird thingy. That part didn't happen. Maybe it did or not. Who knows that was a lot of gas. The Germans did retreat tho and came back two days later and took the fortress but hey. It was cool while it lasted. IDK i have a lot of German in me maybe its genetic i'm scared of Russian people or mauve its justified with this who knows Any way see ya. PS good game"
560,"JEUX FORmidable
"
561,Love it :D
562,"Nice Multi - Adventure Game, recommended playing with friends for more fun xD"
563,its addicting
564,"Great game, one of the better looter shooters"
565,looter shooter with duped loot
566,Worst in the series
567,Just as good as the second one.
568,"The game applies Diablo II's addictive ""loot and level"" formula to a shooter.  Weapon attributes are not limited to damage, accuracy and rate of fire, but can also include recoil, scope zoom level, reload speed etc.  All these attributes are modeled accurately, and can duly affect the outcome of combat."
569,"BORDERLANDS 1, where it all started. If you can start here, b4 the other borderlands."
570,"this game feels so dead and void of personality though its atmosphere is amazing, this a huge difference to borderlands 2 which is packed to the brim with personality though they didnt fix the part where it felt dead and robotic tho way less then the first im glad to see people really enjoy this game but i just cannot stand it"
571,Лаек
572,YES
573,yes
574,"Wouldn't call it the best but sure is a good game. Play-through 2 has it in the right settings, during the first run it's really not necessary to collect anything since most gun can hold up good for next 10 levels or so which made getting anything less exciting. 
For weapons the way each parts makes the same weapon slightly different was really good like the extra capacity, or scope, or power made it possible to engage often with my friends to trade weapons. The number of legendary items in the pool seemed quite small, it's often the one revolver or pistol that came up a bit too often which wasn't such a drawback because I might get the same weapon with better parts but just made it less exciting.
The DLCs were well made and was better than the main game itself, just hated the missions that ask you for some 100s of parts or kills, all of the DLCs has a mission like that which was annoying especially for Underdome the requirement for 375 matches to complete it.
Overall loved the game, loved every boss and Steele wish she had more stage time."
575,The best way to describe this game is guns and alot of guns
576,"I remember when this game first came out in 2009, my parents had split a few years before, and my dad did everything he could to make sure I was happy when I was with him. The most vivid memory I have of this time was when my dad picked me up from my moms house one day, and when we walked in to his apartment, he gestured toward his big, box TV, and there sitting next to it was an xbox 360, and the game box for borderlands. This same day happened to be the very day that BL1 released, and for some reason, my dad thought that this game neither of us had ever heard of before would be a good first game on the new xbox, and by god did he have good intuition. My dad has been a gamer most of his life as well, I guess he's the reason I ever got into video games. It's funny, I remember my dad had started playing borderlands earlier that day, before he had shown it to me that night, and he was only in the Arid Badlands, I remember him saying ""Don't play my character! I've already gotten pretty far and I don't want you messing me up!"" neither of us even knowing that he had only completed about 1% of the game, I just remember thinking that my dad, and this game, were the coolest. We played borderlands together exclusively. Bought every DLC as soon as they were released, and beat them together as they came out. We did this with every game in the series, never missing a single launch date, always beating the games together as a team. I'm 21 now, soon to be 22. My dad turned 58 a few days ago. We haven't been able to play much of BL3 together since I moved out on my own early last year, it was actually the first time I had ever beaten a borderlands game without him. My dad and I talk often, and I always fill him in on the newest video game news, especially for borderlands. I will always be proud to say that my dad is my best friend, and I never would have been able to build the relationship I currently have with him, if it wasn't for the thousands of hours that we spent laughing our asses off together telling stupid jokes, yelling at each other because one of us killed the guy the other was trying to second-wind with, and crying together when the story had become personal to us. And when I find myself caught up in my adult life, I think back to the moment when we first booted up borderlands together in 2009, and how happy it made my dad and I. So thank you Borderlands. 10/10, best game ever.

TL;DR: I love my dad, and I love this game. Thank you dev team."
577,What can i say? This game is a classic and has aged well without even being the enhanced version.
578,"Its a great game to start of with
"
579,"A good game to run, gun and loot with friends or alone."
580,Im playing league of lengends 🥂
581,"Best BL game, freaking loved it and especially with coop!"
582,"A great game to revisit. I remember when this game came out, it was groundbreaking! However, some engine abilities have aged, and I'm finding it harder and harder to find people that will play this with me. This is truly a game to experience with friends, I think, but I also play a healer, so take that with a grain of salt.

Gunfights are high intensity, bosses are fun and the world is a large one to explore. The blend of shooter and RPG mechanics allow for a fast-paced RPG great for someone with a bad attention span like myself.

A true classic, definitely pick it up if you see it on sale."
583,Why dose moxxi make pp hard???

585,all good

587,8.5/10
588,"I wanted to relive some Nostalgia back when I was playing on the PlayStation 3 years ago. It's a beautiful game, very simple with a bit of crude humor. I give it 7.5/10"
589,"[i][b]""Patricia Tannis, Chief scientific advisor, Dahl Corporation, Day 224[/b]. The only conversations I have anymore are with this ECHO recorder. I've developed a relationship with it. Some cycles I sleep with it and others I make it stay outside of my tent!""[/i]"
590,Best game ever!
591,absolute classic. no reason not to buy it
592,"Excellent ! 
Beautiful cel-shading designs.
Intensive pew pew gameplay, even more enjoyable in Co-op.
A cool storyline, a lot of humour with just enough seriousness."
593,"what more do you need?  it's got guns, blood, and mayhem."
594,still fun!
595,I adore all of the goofy shit you can do in this game
596,"Reviewing every game I own #26

Didn't get past the first area because me and my friends couldn't stop running each other over with cars and crying laughing. Don't know if the game is good after that"
597,Good Game
598,Still holds up all these years later!
599,"Idk why i can review this. I have it from a shared libary. 

Anyways, I love the game so friggin' much. It looks plain and repetitive but it isn't. Sure the game is shoot this and shoot that but it's fun. The game looks plain at first and yes it is because you only see a little robot called fag... claptrap and he gives you missions. Then Dr.Zed comes around and gives you missions. Very basic stuff but once you get into it, you'll get hooked. Anyways, imma go play this game rn and you sir/ma'm have a wonderfull day."
600,"Played many times on various systems, great game even better as co-op."
601,It's fun enough but it has definitely aged pretty rough and it can be very stale without friends. Still better a game than 3 though.
602,"Really fun game.  Room for lots of progression at a good pace that does not make it boring to grind. Graphics are vastly updated in the enhanced version though, so download that one instead."
603,:)
604,"This game is quite good, who would say that?! Ok now seriously this is great shooter game, but I think the best thing about this game is Claptrap repeating his ""Check me out, I am dancing, I am dancing""!"
605,"An excellent game with great game mechanics, interface, and scaling. The only complaint is that the game is too short and the missions feel a bit repetitive."
606,This is one of the greatest open-world RPG shooters that has ever been released. It makes me rock hard every time I think about it. I wish one of the Psychos were my dad.
607,"Its the OG Borderlands, plenty of fun! 
"
608,"Creo que es muy buen juego, al principio se me hizo un poco dificil pero aprendiendo que armas utilizar dependiendo los enemigos es mucho mas facil, son muchisimas misiones y bastante largo el juego"
609,LEGENDARY GAME 5/5
610,"The second game is way better. This one is boring, has no interesting story, and all of the missions are basically 'go here - kill this guy - come back' or tedious fetch quests. Go play the second game."
611,Good game
612,"gr8 game
"
613,It could be better
614,"Trust me, This is a classic of a game!"
615,Yes
616,good game but wait for sale
617,It's a classic! Fun times.
618,fucking great game buy it give them the money
619,This game has a fair amount of easter eggs and pretty funny to boot. It can be a little frustrating at times but not always.
620,What can you say about the game that invented repetitive over stylized Randy wank. Seems tastefully tame now compared to the squeakquels.
621,"I just realised that i never posted a review for this masterpiece
"
622,"It's the same game we all know and love, but newer and better! The fighting is intense and satisfying. Lot's of special effects. Many options for enhancing difficulty and LOOT.  Guns guns guns guns guns"

639,"This was my first PC video game. It got me into gaming... along came Borderlands 2 then I started playing Fallout 4 and now I am building my own rigs. This game has high sentimental value for me, it's not as fast or funny as Borderlands 2 but I highly recommend playing it if you love the Borderlands franchise... it's where it all began."
640,Straight classic.
641,"This is the shooter I play if I want to have fun popping heads with a sniper rifle. It's also the game I play when I want to punch a lot of bad guys. I also play it to shoot some cool interesting guns that can always be changing, and it seems like the DLC is a great bang for your buck. Not to mention how fun this game is with more then 1 person playing. Highly recommend."
642,"Best shooter ever, my favorite of all time along with Rage and Doom
"
643,"There's not much I can say here, this game is a classic and everyone should own it."
644,Cool
645,Tis great lads
646,"One of the nicest piece of nostalgia of my library. Purchased the game on PS3 with my roomate when it came out and we had a lot of fun with it, and playing it again reminds me the good times!"
647,"I love this game, but boy is is hard on the eyes! Try Enhanced Edition."
648,No offense but i got bored after 2 hours when i played this game it's no where near as good as borderlands 2 and that game is one of my favorites so my suggestion is buy borderlands 2 instead of this game you will get bored after a short period of time.
649,Really Good easy game with loads of content to cover.
650,Gun
651,"Bordrlands is a fun game to play. I love the characters and the variety of guns available. some of the missions can be frustrating, but overall it is an enjoyable game, the dlc is fun to play, especially the robot rebellion and the zombie island, but you should be above 10th level before journeying to either of those. I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes to just sit down to a good gaming session."

653,"Good looter shooter. If you don't know the story, it is worth playing the game for once. Classes in borderlands have diverse choices in playstyle and if you aren't the typical machinegun type of player, I recommend Mordecai. Snipers and revolvers are a cool combination that only get better by throwing a hawk at the enemy."
654,A game i did many times with enjoyment
655,<3
656,really fun game
657,Pis off
658,IS GOOD!
659,"The enhanced edition includes all the DLC's. 

10/10 game."
660,This game is still absolutely amazing after all these years. I think it still beats out 95% of all games on the market and it was released in 2009. The cell shading graphics are still amazing and the game play is still solid. The only thing I had to change was adding an FOV button which took 10 seconds and made the game absolutely perfect.
661,Good game!
662,best enjoyed with a cup of soup and some nice bread
663,"I'm not done with this game yet, but it's honestly a really good game. I spent $10 for this but the original cost of $30 is well worth it. My opinion might change of this game when I finish it, but for now it's a 9/10"
664,geam
665,"A wonderful game, some of the most enjoyable hours I spent."
666,i love me sum borderlands :D
667,"Yes yes, good game that looks like a cartoon combined with a first person shooter with strange creatures who's mouths open wider than wide putin's body with bandits here and there and convenient bullets and health and stuff just laying in piles of the earth's surface and gives you a better looking version when you buy."
668,good
669,This game is fun. It's not as fun as Borderlands 2 because it's not split screen. Split screen is fun.
670,game ok

672,Зашёл в игру покричал и вышел. Ебаный цикл
673,"Admit it or not, Borderlands 1 is one of the [b]most underrated games ever[/b], and it definitely deserves as much recognition as Borderlands 2, if not more. The storytelling is a bit lackluster, and the ending of the campaign is also kind of a let-down ([spoiler]no major reward after killing The Destroyer[/spoiler]), but otherwise everything about the game is A+, from the gameplay, to the weaponry, etc. Farming legendaries is also fun (apart from a number of oranges that are a huge pain), and the level scaling is also quite linear, allowing us to use your favourite guns for longer durations.

Although a lot of people prefer playing BL2 over BL1, I will always have a soft corner for this game. My only request to Gearbox Studios is that they add BL1 to the Handsome Collection :D"
674,"Played since 2009 on ps3 so i'd say its pretty good
"
675,Amazing game that started a spectacular franchise
676,yes
677,insanely challenging but overall a good game
678,Probably the best Borderlands title when it comes to game play but the weakest when it comes to story.  The co-op campaign was revolutionary for its time and 16164886 different weapons guarantees each play through is going to be slightly different.
679,"One of the progenitor looter-shooters, Borderlands helped usher in a genre with little aplomb and total absurdity.  Fantastic character design, gameplay geared to making you feel god-like in most situations and unphased by death in those situations where you're brought to earth, and an entertaining storyline.

Might feel dated if you planned the latter games but worth a glance if you haven't."
680,POG
681,"Borderlands: Game of The Year Edition polishes up a game that generally looked incredible and played well, so the move up to 4K is certifiably not an emotional change. Upgrades to navigation and inventory management eliminate a portion of the dreary minutes that initially eased back things down, however the progressions to the all around feeble last supervisor battle make it altogether simpler, which is the specific inverse of what it required. Obviously, Borderlands' mission's ongoing interaction, humor, and appeal hold up, which makes it a dependably fun time, particularly in co-op."
682,"[i] This has always been one of my favorite games. When it first came out, it was a sleeper game, and it's such a classic I can still pick it up years later and have a blast! [/i]"
683,good times
684,GRET GAEM! VERY FUN YO PLEY
685,"The game itself is great, but the graphics are horrible and makes the game less enjoyable"
686,I'm not a fan of the Borderlands series but this is still a thumbs up.
687,My favourite borderlands so far. Still worth playing IMO.
688,"Can't go wrong with old school Borderlands, it rocks every time! :)"
689,who doesn't like the craziness of borderlands?
690,"BL2 and BL3's narcissism is a far cry from the pioneered vision of the original's gritty barren wastelands. Nowadays there's too much visual 'noise' and arrogant characters that killed future installments for me. Anyways, thanks to the small modding community that kept this game going so GBX could release an enhanced edition a decade later, and see profits. Check out Mr.Grimmjow's Arsenal on Nexus Mods and GBX forums and you won't be disappointed. His weapon packs and long awaited DLC5 (WIP) comprised of 8 new maps earned him a path into game development professionally. Not to mention I bought this game for the second time solely for his End User Created Content (EUCC). Lastly, he released a pack that corrects all the weapon glitches that were released with the vanilla game, since GBX never bothered to! Oh yeah, but they did kill the fledgling modding community with patch 1.30."
691,ass
692,Good game.
693,It's aight.
694,yes
695,It gud
696,its old but still gold
697,Good yes
698,"Love the open world and love the gold key from shift. 
Ask me how to get those gold key for all the borderlands 1-3 even the pre sequel."
699,"BEST GAME EVER MADE
"
700,"The game that started a Bordarlands franchise, released in 2009. It evolves around few mercenaries who want to find a ""Vault"", a secret alien technology on planet Pandora. You can choose to play one of 4 characters, and when you finish the game, you can play it again with the same character, or choose a new one, but you will be faced with stronger enemies and better loot, so there is a great value of replayability to this game.

The game itself is an FPS, with nice RPG elements that include skill tree and leveling up, you have the main story, and a lot of side quests that will help you grow stronger. This game has nicely done graphics in cartoonish style that gives it a unique look. There are also numerous unique bosses and enemies that all have their own agendas, and you will have to deal with all of them, but you will have to use different tactics in order to beat them. 

I can not write this review without mentioning goofy robot ClapTrap who will make you laugh, and annoy you at the same time. His legendary ""check me out, I'm dancing!!!"" is hilarious. He is a good and original addition to this game. The ideas for this game must have come out of very disturbed individuals, it is obvious in every step of the way. 

So you have RPG/FPS hybrid, with original graphics, with lots of gore and profanities, awesome loot, vehicles that you can drive around, great replay value of the game, great story and side quests, open world. This is a really awesome game, and the leader of the whole franchise. How could I not recommend this game?"
701,"This franchise tought me to play games in their good order. Because my friend insisted we play Borderlands2, swearing there are no connections with the first. After playing the 1st game, coping through the old mechanics and menus, i was satisfied i finally found out where it all began.

I would not recommend this game for itself - stand-alone game, but for the story and the franchise it started."
702,The motion controls make me sick. I get a headache from the way the camera moves.
703,I have over 700 hours playing this game not sure why it only says I've played 37 hours but it's a great game very hard to put down.  so many levels and play throughs and so funny as well.  Clap trap will keep you in stitches.  Great co-op game for 4 as well.
704,"I remember back in the day when i played this game on my xbox 360 and then it would have rod (red ring of death) and i couldn't play anymore. So i watched some MacGyver and then i got this amazing idea, i would collect some 5 cent coins and glue them to the prosessors of the xbox 360 console's motherboard because apparently they forgot to add cooling into that thing. After i did it i could play this amazing game again for like 30 minutes before it would rod again. 
But back into the game this is my favorite borderlands when it comes to the atmosphere and i think the first borderlands had the best and most genuine borderlands experience.
No annoying and repeating dialogs or annoying characters just pure mayhem and exploration."
705,i hate lilith
706,Yes! (Claptrap dancing in the background)
707,Gearbox humour isn't funny.
708,"back where it all started, i do enjoy BL1 but 2 refined it so much more and took the series to completely new heights, this game however does have things i miss such as weapon proficiencies and loot rooms like in the General Knoxx dlc, the GOTY edition also did a good job of refining the gameplay and graphics a lot more (i could have reviewed that one but with most of my hours being on this one i felt like it would have been better if i reviewed this.) if you do decide to buy BL1 i would recommend that version for a optimal experience."
709,"The game that started a franchise. I remember first playing borderlands when a friend brought it over on xbox 360 for a sleep over, we almost beat the game that night and spent countless summer nights playing and re playing it. The characters are easy to fall in love with and a easy to hate villain. The weapons can become a bit stagnant if you find something over powerd, You may not switch weapons for the next couple of level ups. The skill tree's are unique and provide a lot of replability without the need of a grind. If you wanted to swap your skill tree out you can do that with little to no time investment other than picking out your new skills. This makes going back and farming for gear a lot of fun, you never know what new item you will find and then centre your build around. The DLC in this game is beyond amazing, It blew mine and everyone i talked to, expectations away and set a standard that unfortunately the latter games could not follow. Id highly reccommend this game to anyone whos looking for a 4 player shoot n loot type game to have fun and get lost in."
710,First person shooter with a twisted scene.
711,f
712,"Definitely has a ton of funny moments that made me laugh.
It was slightly difficult to get it to work properly and gave me motion
sickness when waving the gun around for some reason (maybe I'm doing something wrong here)
But doesn't work well for higher frame rates because it was a port from an older console generation.
I also had to get a hair transplant after pulling my hair out from the missing quest item BUG, which had
me stuck at 6/7 items to collect. 'It' showing green on the map and also 'it' showing that it was in
a place where it clearly wasn't. Happened a couple of times.
Even still the First mission in the game was a moment that stuck with me that I didn't experience in many
other games and left me stuck in a small area to fend off a really cool and aggressive boss while I was armed 
with a shotgun and little ammunition left at the end of the level. Actually surprised me at how genuinely
good that moment was and you can find more set pieces like this with very likeable characters and great story
delivery that may have an edge over Borderlands 2 imo. [u] A Must buy in the 3 game bundle collection. [/u]"
713,no. get bl3 instead
714,"Best borderlands out of the 3 in my personal opinion, have played it since it came out, a real underdog of a game, great funny story line, definitely better than borderlands 3 personally, borderlands 2 came out great too but I played it too many times  already so right now Im retaking bd 1"
715,"Firmly in the Old but Gold category. The second and third ones (and the pre-sequel) are better, and the ending is terrible. But it's a fine game in Coop (Avoid it if solo)."
716,An absolute must play if you like the other borderlands games
717,"great good game so yes would play 
"
718,"came from console, very good but you need all the dlcs for the best experience"
719,great game been playing since the release on ps3 such fun with mates.
720,One of my all time favorites.
721,Started it all. Solid game right here. T.K. is my waifu.
722,"goated
10/10"
723,"Still an amazing game a long time after it was made, love it.
"
724,"I genuinely enjoyed Borderlands. The character. looting, and shooting aspects are great. I mainly spent my time running around and shooting enemies for loot. I would recommend the game if you like shooters and looter video games."
725,its pretty fun but your time and money would be better spent on the second or third game as this one comes across as a ugly version of those two
726,"I had to rewrite this review three times to figure out why I can't stick with this game. I've played this game several times, and never made enough progress before moving onto something else. And it is in rewritting this review so many times that made me realize that the issue for both is because this game is unmemorable. Through all of the effort and play that I put into this title, the gameplay, story, characters, nor world changed in a way that was rewarding.

I am almost certain this is more a symptom of the game not aging well rather than a core issue with the game from the start. From the open-world shooter genre down to the formula this game is designed around simply have more entertaining contenders with better pacing, including within it's own franchise. But this game left a bad taste in my mouth, and I am actually less likely to play a modern Borderlands title because of it."
727,yes
728,Love!
729,"It's a very fun game if you have someone to play it with, I spent a whole town in one day"
730,"A classic. It has Mr. Torgue.
What more can I say, man. I love it to bits."
731,oh ywah
732,man i love fighting the same boring enemies for the first three hours. too bad im never gonna open this again cuz theres a billion games far more worth my time
733,10/10
734,"Dodged this game for quite some time due to the graphics.  Finally got talked into grabbing it and it's been a love/hate relationships ever since.  Honestly wish I had got it back when it was new and more of my friends were into it.  Luckily, It's good enough several are willing to replay it every time I mention it."
735,"Great game, lots of fun either on your own or with friends"
736,Is Not Alright
737,cute
738,"Wirklich Lustiges Spiel. Hab damit viel Zeit verbracht
"
739,"I really enjoyed playing this game with my friends although I didn't understand much about the plot but hey at least I enjoyed beating some enemies and bosses; and searching missing items. What's important? Teamwork! (que song Wonderpets)

P/s: There were (still) some few bugs where enemies suddenly disappear etc but oh well just restart the game and it'll be fine."
740,"I have played this game for many hours on various platforms, and always come back when boredom strikes and I don't know what to play. It's a fantastic game from the artwork, to the music, to the jokes that would get you fired from your day job. You can play it just to run around and shoot whatever crosses your path, or you can play through the story (which really picks up in subsequent games). The lore is fun and there are plenty of Easter eggs and goals to keep 100%ers occupied. This game definitely earns a 5 star rating from me, and it probably will for you too."
741,game laggy like alan brain brurburbrubrubrurburburbrubru
742,"Borderlands 1 is a great game and possibly my favorite borderlands. Is it as polished and full of interesting loot as 2 or the pre sequel? Nah. Is it as jam packed with content as 2 or the pre sequel? Definitely not, the one thing definitely holding this game back is a lack of content towards the end game. But without a doubt it is an absolutely stellar looter-shooter RPG that sticks to what its good at and creates an experience that still holds up to this day. There's that saying, ""jack of all trades master of none"". I think this game is the first example of a jack of all trades master of all. This game has an amazing diablo esque loot system with solid FPS gunplay and an interesting open world full of opportunities for exploration and, dare i say it, roleplaying. It is rare to find a game that tackles this many elements without at least one being either underdeveloped or just poorly implemented in general. This game was the springboard for not only the rest of the borderlands series but massive amounts of other looter shooters to come, none in my opinion outside of the borderlands series itself managing to capture the same magic that this game holds. In conclusion, buy the game."
743,okay fr dont get this one get the enhanced version even though its no different
744,This was the best start for borderlands I love all them.
745,"The original looter shooter. I'll come back to it for nostalgia, but I recommend Borderlands 2 over it."
746,good
747,"This is a wholesome, nonviolent game.v"
748,I played bl2 for 500 hours and I played bl1 for 5. I prefer bl1.
749,its its its its yea
750,"Nice story, funny characters, lots and lots of weapons, graphics that have aged quite well, and the ability to keep you playing for hours without getting bored.

Still a jewel. 10/10"
751,The first of the love-hate relationship with the borderlands series. While you don't need to play this understand the rest of the games it can be nice to see where it all started. If you are new to borderlands it would be best to start with 2 its arguably the best of the lot. if you want to see where the king of looter shooters started from or just have a craving for games of the whole different time then pick up this rough old gem.
752,I quite fancy this one.
753,Classic
754,a
755,"honest to god a good game... right now trying to think how to explain to those who never played borderlands games before...

borderlands is a first person shooter based in a planet of alien monsters and psychotic people. you are hunting the legendary vault that holds... something inside it... which no one really knows whats in (until the end)

you get to play as four players lilith or brick... oh right and theres mordecai and roland but trust me... you want to play as lilith she has the best benifts not to say the others dont too. brick is unstoppable power house... mordecai is the sniper and roland has a turret friend. but the only two the solo well are brick and lilith  which sucks... but if you find friends to play this with you its awesome!

as a gamer this game is pretty good for a time waster... it hasn't aged well there are parts that will drive you nuts but its a funish game.

as a achievement hunter yeah all the achievements are obtainable... so long as you play lilith because thats the only way to beat carmerax solo... im sure someone out there will prove me wrong... but i played mordecai with my friend who was play lilith and got downed alot to carmerax and his kids but my friend again playing lilith shrugged it off and kept moving. 

in the end if you can find a group of friends its great but when you get to second play through its hard as balls if you dont play brick or lilith"
756,There 1000s of different guns there are.
757,"I like the unconventional art style, but I'm afraid that's the only good thing I can say about Borderlands. I guess Claptrap is cute and funny - shame a faceless little robot side-character has more personality than all the rest of the game's characters combined.

Enemies are bullet sponges, and are seldom fought fewer than a dozen at a time. Often I'll get a trickle of 2-3 enemies at a time, more spawning as I kill the preceding ones. Like really? They couldn't make combat interesting so they made it time consuming instead. Why keep spawning more and more pointless enemies? Boss battles are unfairly difficult and deplete way too much ammo. Vehicle control is different from most other games, leading to erratic, unintended behavior. (I'm used to WASD to control + mouselook to shoot; but mouselook is steering in a vehicle here.) It is super easy to wedge a vehicle between 2 tiny rocks and become stuck. I spent more time reloading than shooting because it takes so long. Inventory management is trash. Keeping track of which weapons are ""good"" and which ones I've picked up that are garbage is way too difficult. Figuring out if this new weapon is better than what I've got is needlessly complicated. Enemies are loot pinatas - I shouldn't have to chase around everywhere to loot things one at a time. I stopped press/hold E to loot all because that same control also equips a weapon as its looted. The story is so thin that I quickly found myself not knowing what is going on. There is no way to manually save - you must find a checkpoint & hope it registers. I experienced a crash to desktop twice while 90% through clearing a mission, forcing me to replay it. Checkpoints that appear mid-mission save your progress, but if you quit the game/come back later, you'll spawn at the entrance. Seriously, why can't I save where I want, when I want? Game menus are console peasantry/controller optimized. There's a delay on the confirmation box when I try to sell something, usually need to Confirm sale 2-3 times before it takes. There was a significant difficulty ramp in the last couple hours of the story. I died more at the end than I had the entire game up to that point - annoying and frustrating. Lots of little annoyances and bad design decisions add up to one huge, unenjoyable mess. I seriously don't know how this was good enough to make any sequels. Definitely not what I expected."
758,oh look some loot.
759,this game is the one of the best games on steam
760,Well priced and great game play. Just like I remember when it first came out.
761,"Borderlands has a great shoot 'n loot gameloop. Pressing m1 and watching enemies drop really tickles the dopamine receptors in my brain. So far I've only played the birdman which has been really fun and I can't wait to try out the other classes. 

no think, just shoot and loot."
762,clap trap sucks
763,epic levels of nostalgia
764,"A great time, a great day on pandora, you'll love the game. Borderlands 1 rules"

767,It's depressing and every time i play this game i feel alone and sad
768,"beutiful game,"
769,Good
770,still a fun game to this day
771,There is virtually no reason to ever return to this game when the rest of the series is remarkably better in every single way.
772,the very good
773,ye
774,Good game
775,"This is the best Borderlands game. 
It does not have the movement options the other games do, it does not have the funding the other games did, but the game does have charm. You find out what happens during the game in the side quests while listening to characters speak, or in the flavor text of missions or items. 
Pandora is a hostile world filled with dangerous wildlife and psychotic beings, including you, who share a fever dream of the Great Vault containing safe passage in terms of protection, guns, or loot that may carry them through their harsh environment. 
I think the thing that I enjoy most about this game is it's from a time where a company would value yours, you weren't stuck behind a gameplay loop designed to reduce time you'd spend playing games the competition might produce, every DLC was full of value, and you can just kick up your feet and shoot things."
776,"Love all the Gearbox games and even though this game is old, It's still great and so much fun especially with friends, I highly recommend."
777,some games don't need sequels

791,always a fun time to play and yes use keyboard and mouse
792,"Worth a playthrough but borderlands 2 is much better 
7/10"
793,"For an RPG lover and a person who played FPS for most of his childhood, Borderlands was definitely a hit. Cartoon graphics, open world, lots of quests and lots of loot.

This is where it all started. Shoot, loot, repeat. Four classes (Hunter, Soldier, Siren and Berserker), huge maps, challenging bosses. 

Play as one of the available characters, also known as Vault Hunters, and try to reach the treasures hidden in the legendary vault. Fight against bloodthirsty beasts, lunatic bandits and fanatical armies. Each Vault Hunter has a unique Action Skill with different skill trees to improve their playstyle.

Although characters can train proficiency with all weapons, each of them has specific abilities for one or two. Mordecai has abilities that enhance the use of pistols and sniper rifles. Roland is skilled in the use of shotguns and combat rifles. Lilith has advantages when using SMGs and elemental weapons. And Brick who uses his fists and explosive heavy weapons.

But for me that wasn't bad, as it encourages the player to at least test each of the characters. Besides, my main character was a Brick who used a pistol (Pestilent Defiler), a sniper rifle (Volcano), an SMG (Hellfire) and a combat rifle (Ogre).

The biggest drawback for me was some of the map sizes. Some of them didn't seem ""populated"" enough. And emptiness can be exhausting at times. Even because there was no minimap for guidance."
794,"This game is amazing, easily one of my top 5 best games."
795,"This is just an all around masterpiece of a game, I'd highly recommend it."
796,"Nice and unique game, 100x better with friends !"
797,that was great and that need be free because that has remaster game
798,"Very good game for its age, fun gameplay even if it lacks a story it is still one of my favorite games from one of my favorite game series"
799,fun af
800,"Its a fun fps
"
801,"The O.G looter shooter. Not as flashy or complex as some of the other games in it's genre or even it's successors, but it surprisingly still holds up really well. The core mechanics of shooting and constantly getting better guns was already nearly perfected here. The cel-shaded look is also still unique. Also get this version instead of the Enhanced one. This one dosen't have any framrates issues and more dynamic lighting.

804,"Borderlands is an extremly imaginative criticism of modern consumer culture and 9-5 jobs. It lays out a dystopian world that sends the player out in a gruesom battle against otherworldy opponents. After every fight the game allows you to upgrade your weapons and skills (this could be understood for always needing better and new things in the capitalist western society). After shooting, skilling and collecting for countless of hours, the player realizes, that the new things he/she obtained are not making him/her feel more content, therefore changing his/her daily habits, getting a new job, working out and at last, he/she stops to play pointless video games."
805,pretty nice shooty-shooty bang-bang gaem with some cool looting and story
806,Loved it
807,More mayhem moreeeeeeee
808,IMHO the best in the entire series.
809,sick game. love the borderlands series
810,Nastolgia is the only reason I have this game

812,........................................................................................................
813,Best Game Alive
814,it is not the greatest game of all time but its the father of looter shooter but yes it is a good shooter
815,"Borderlands is the perfect introduction to the looter shooter genre with amazing characters, varied environments and an explosive playstyle."
816,i have played 21 hours of this game and it is pretty ok
817,"It's ok, at least this version is playable, but it doesn't have a minimap."
818,"it good
"
819,"This game stands up even now, years after its release. The UI has some issues where all the text about weapons isn't always displayed, but the core gameplay and even the graphics still hold up, likely due to the cell shading. This version is more stable than the enhanced edition, which crashed on me several times, so I still prefer this one when I want to play the OG game."

823,"Uninstalled Borderlands, trapped in beside a spawn point because a boss 5 levels higher than me, in a town, keeps attacking me, cant leave the area, get hit while the respawn animation is playing so I have 35 hp to run away from her, which I cant do because she's faster than me. I wasn't impressed with this game to begin with but now that I cannot progress in any way, forget it, not worth your time."

825,"If you never played the Borderlands series you definitely should. There is an Enhanced version of the original and it looks great, but if you really want to go back to 2009 and have that good old nostalgic feeling of the the old 2K intro, but also the gameplay in that time period then get this one. The original and first Borderlands game is a very fun experience, as Borderlands is a pure definition of a looter-shooter game. As for the enhanced edition I recommend you to pick that one up as well since it has improved graphics and some fixes, but regarding a more detailed review on the enhanced version you should check my profile as I did make a separate review for that version as well."
826,"one of the all time best games made. if you havent played it you're wrong
"
827,"The original swiss army knife of gunplay.

If you really hated the changes that Borderlands 2 made to weapon mechanics (and the removal of Atlas weapons) and you don't mind a little less refinement to gameplay, Borderlands 1/Borderlands GOTY is a perfect second course.

I still recommend Borderlands 2 over this one, but if your friend owns this and it's on sale it's a great deal with a lot of content. Other than that, it's a pretty cut and dry Gearbox Borderlands title. Average story, lots of guns, lots of running around, nice stylised visuals, etc etc.

Well worth the money on sale."
828,"Classic shooter with an attitude, one of my favorites, I wish people still played it."
829,Classic.
830,gud
831,"Rating: good

Fantastic selection of guns, amusing world-building, and interesting graphical style.

Sadly, the experience is marred by horrific level scaling that trivializes the content if you want to actually play it all. (And no, ""play through the entire game twice without doing sidequests or DLC, after which things will scale to your level"" is not a viable solution. But the fact that this is actually [i]recommended[/i] by players is telling.)"
832,Poggers
833,fun
834,its fun but what is goty???
835,"Grade : A (77/100)

Hmmm, the game seems fun with boundless weapons, iconic landscapes and varied enemy designs. However, it is also quite a bit repetitive and can feel like a chore at times. I also wished the story could have been more engaging. It is just too fractured to truly enjoy. Also, there are some design choices which could have been handled better.

Overall, pretty average game, but there are certainly many enjoyable moments in it.

Full Review: https://ravencrowgames.blogspot.com/2021/05/review-borderlands.html"
836,To me this game is very bland and boring. I've never really given up on a game but with this one i have. I've played 18 hours of this game and it's just not good. There are too many side quests and the game is just lacking in so much. I've come to the conclusion that this game just isn't for me.
837,"This game is fun, I'm sure most would enjoy."
838,"I used to stream this game on Twitch back in the Justin.tv days with the GearBox guys hanging out with me every day.  Things have changed a lot, sadly.  Best thing about this version over all other Borderlands games and enhancements?  Decapitations, de-limb-ing's.  Grit, Grain, BLOOD and edge!  It's like a 1970's horror film in semi-cartoon mode with edge detection.  This is the only Borderlands game you ever need.  The rest are trash, dumbed down, infested with political correct nonsense, apologetic and WAY too clean, bloodless, and you can't popcorn a bandit head.  Con's?  LOTS of them to choose from as you cut your way through Pan-Purgatory."
839,A classic that is replayable with extra classes.
840,"Played with a friend. Very pleasant at first, The repetitiveness of the gameplay quickly sets in. The storyline is anecdotal and is only a pretext to travel between the different zones. But it's a game to try anyway."
841,"da bandittt go ""ou me fkill ouo:"" and i dgo ""n"" and fucikjign obliterate them"
842,great game
843,The ugly duckling of the franchise.

845,"""They all drift off into slack-jawed soliloquies about a man who knew a man who knew a man..."""
846,"its a good game and you should test your skills on it :)
"
847,"What a great first game in the series!

I remember playing this on console when it first came out and this game definitely holds the test of time with gameplay and humor. I will admit that the Enhanced version of this game is more tolerable from a technological perspective but I decided to punish myself and play both versions back to back (I definitely don't recommend doing this).

Definitely a recommended game for me, don't play both the Enhanced/non-Enhanced versions back to back, and just have fun in the first game in a great series!"
848,a classic its what pimps play si
849,good game
850,classic looter-shooter! it's where the genre was born
851,9/10 solid game
852,"This game is fun with friends, but also super bugged, repetitive and anti-climatic. I enjoyed it, though I might not be interested in playing this by myself. But I had a great time with my friend."
853,Ending is horrible but I loved the game that started one of the best game series ever
854,"The game that started it all, showcasing the skeleton of the series with the addition of having a much more grounded set of characters compared to what comes in the future installments. 

As always, you play as a variety of characters offering unique ways to murder walking loot containers, along with a variety of weapons offering more options to work with, but as it is the first game the combinations don't get too visually extreme. Most of what makes this game fun is the math side of RPGs rather than the combat side of shooters, but if you wanted a slower version of Borderlands 2 that focused more on RPG elements then you're likely to enjoy this game very much."
855,wohoo
856,"Decently fun looter shooter with friends, not as much solo but to each their own in that regard."
857,terrible grindy game
858,"Borderlands is my first looter-shooter game I have ever played and boiii i love it. Bordelands wasn't a pioneer in this genre (as I remember it was Hellgate London), but it clearly made almost everything correct. As a diablo die hard fun, I can certainly say, that the neverending cycle of item grind feels quite good. Main game is a masterpiece, but unfortunately i can't say same thing about dlcs. Some of them really made me crazy, I am talking about you UNDERDOME !!! Go straightforward for Goty version, it is worth every penny."

862,nice game but costlu
863,Whish more games had these graphics.
864,great game
865,"Boring...boring...boring...
It is the worst RPG I have ever played. NOthing is interesting. Nothing is fun. EVERYTHING is tedious. This is an RPG that hates progress above all other things.  Loves tediousness. There is only one good thing about the game and that is Claptrap. But that's not enough to wade through this."
866,"Really enjoying this game, true there are some tedious bits (at least until you figure out who is located near which fast travel location anyway) but overall the pace of the game is good. The story is funny & entertaining and the mix of missions keep it from going stale easily
The RPG element of the game is ok, I've only played as a single character so far so wont comment too much on this.
I really love the graphic style and find it to be quite timeless, the sound design is pretty good too.

Overall its good fun game with tons of side-missions (especially if you get all the DLC) to keep you going for a while"
867,i like
868,So much fun
869,Awesome weapons! Overall a great game.
870,"The first dose of an ever growing series of crazy people using guns to loot guns and gun bigger angry mobs to get more guns.

873,"This is basically a demo. I am not certain though for what, as it does not run on a unique engine, but on Unreal. Perhaps for investors, to demonstrate the idea behind the game.

It is a sandbox containing the basic elements of games, that can be tried and tested. Of course those elements are simple and spartanic. For example: NPCs share a small pool of skins and single sentences and they are merely part of the decoration. Some of them function as spenders for simple generic fetch-quests (Collect X things, Go to Y places and press the Use-button there). The world is mostly monotone, empty and static and moreover resets constantly. All the lootable objects, the enemies and bosses re-appear. This makes it very convenient for the developers to debug and see immediately the results of their tweaks.
For a player though, there is not much to do. This as an early access, that will never be worked on. An interstate of a game, that may very well have been pushed to Steam by accident.

For the ones, that wonder, why despite all of this it sold 2 million times: You can open unlimited lootchests for free in it. And this hits a specific nerv, that some people seem to have. Otherwise slotmachines would not exist.

878,Great game. Go for it.
879,"The game that started it all, if you like FPS's you'll love this!"
880,Just as good as I remember :)
881,"great game, but don't play the moxxi dlc unless you want to rip your hair out."
882,"This port is absolute trash. Every 40 minutes or so after you start playing the frame rate drops to unplayable levels (we're talking 5 frames per second at best).

It doesn't matter if you set your graphics to the lowest possible or not. It still does not fix the issue.

Before everyone screams, ""It is your hardware or an overheating problem or an hard drive issue"". No. It isn't.

I have a Ryzen 3900x with a GeForce GTX 2080 Super, 32 GB of DDR ram running on a SDD. 

I have done extensive research online about the issue and there are hundreds of people having the issue and there is no fix to it. The closest thing is disabling cutscenes and loading screen transitions through shortcut command modifications on your startup menu and even that doesn't fix it half the time.

I have never written a real review before until now and I only wrote it to save other people money on this garbage. Pretty pathetic that this ran better on my PS3 like 15 years ago or however long ago it was then it does now on a computer with 20x the computing power.

Gross. DO NOT BUY."
883,"Dreary repetitive garbage. Go kill this, go clear that camp, go find this, go speak to them, boooooring!
NPCs are worse than most 6th gen games. They don't even have lip sync or proper animations lmao.
Pretty much no story, boring ass world, few characters that are generally grating...
Combat is sometimes fun. That's it. Everything else sucks.
Just why oh why did Boringlands get a sequel?"
884,"A genre defining title and the beginning of what's easily one of the best looter shooter franchises out there.

All in all, everything that makes a good Borderlands game is present since the very start and the charm of it all is able to entertain for dozens of hours. It was also enough to create masses of fans with thirst for more, which would later spun an entire franchise across many different mediums, including the even more successful sequels, all building on the core elements presented here, such as the very iconic art style, incredibly engaging and fun co-op gameplay, memorable quirky characters, icredibly well tuned combination of the best RPG and FPS elements, weapon parts with distinctive abilities forming into countless possible guns and of course as the name suggest, a semi-open, barren, desolate world with dangerous creatures and people at every corner.

Of course in hindsight, compared to the sequels that later came out and perfected just about everything, the game is lacking in many aspects that are taken for granted nowadays, be it the very simplistic and straighforward storyline, lack of properly varied endgame, limited and fairly uneventful talents, weapon choices, enemy units or just in general fluidity and gameplay smoothness that's very much expected in just about any FPS title. Suffice to say, the game shows its more then a decade old age.

In any case, an absolute must-have for anyone wanting to experience the franchise and where it all began.

885,borderlands 2 is better but this OG and i wont forget it

888,"First Of all 
this game is so sick The best series of games I have ever played
what makes this game so sick is most the graphics of the apocalypse thet found at this game 
The description of the enemies and psychopaths who are in the game is described with very good humor for example their screams that come to kill you so funny the bosses in addition are so original something I have not seen in other games.
this game is very great with friends 
i am relly recommand this game and all of The game series
relly best games that i ever playd

889,The best one.

891,"best borderlands game ever.
2 is also great/
but this one is classic"
892,Great co op game to play with friends!
893,"Fair warning - it's hard for me to be objective with this game, because its my favorite in the series. If you wanted an honest or objective critique from me, that's for another time. So this review is going to be pretty scatterbrained and relentlessly positive, so TL;DR I love this game and you should give it a shot.

For those of you unfortunate enough to want to read on...

Every time I re-download it or get it again on another system I end up maxing out a character or two. Sure the AI is dated by today's standards and the levels can feel a bit empty (though for this game I don't mind it), but the simplicity of the core gameplay just keeps pulling me back. Shoot, loot, shoot again is damn fun, and maybe its nostalgia talking but I just love the guns in this game! I also think it has the best art design of the series, with its cell-shaded style that's not over-the-top ""cartoony"" like BL2 (3 is less-so, but not as flat or drab as this one).

The game's not perfect though (as much as my rose-tinted brain might lead you to believe), and being the first one it has plenty of rough edges and lacks some QOL improvements that we got in BL2 like being able to move when in FFYL or auto-pickup of cash and ammo (which fortunately is in the Enhanced version of BL1). But perhaps the thing I like the most about BL1 is the charm and the atmosphere. The game treats the world rather seriously, and its filled to the brim with crazy people. I think the best way to put it is that BL1 is a 'serious' game with comedy sprinkled in its dialogue and text, whereas BL2 is more of a dark comedy with serious moments (most of them involving Jack). I can't even compare it much to BL3 because I couldn't sit through that game past like Lv.15. At least the mediocre story we got here was better than what we got most recently... though I think that does a disservice to what story we do get in BL1. While we don't get much of an ""epic quest""-type of story, we do get plenty of world-building through Echo tapes, text logs, and character dialogue, and we get to see just how f**ked up Pandora really is. I thought what was there was great, and if you really just wanted to shoot dudes and weird alien creatures then you could just ignore all of that and start blasting. Best of both worlds, in my opinion. (Though BL2 has a much better campaign, hands down.)

I'm sure this 'review' barely makes any sense and makes no solid arguments for anything, but all you really need to know about my opinion is that I've loved this game since I first rented it from Blockbuster, and have since bought it on basically every system its come out on. This game is timeless in my opinion, and if you enjoyed BL2 (because let's face it, you've already played BL2 if you're here right now) then you ought to give the original a chance. Who knows, maybe you'll like it just as much as I do.

PS: Go give Pre-Sequel another chance."
894,"Gameplay 7/10
Story 7/10

Well worth the money. Just beware, playing online, many people have cheated their experience points(and most likely other things as well)."
895,This game defines what an RPG should be. The level system and multitude of weapons and gear makes this game infinitely replayable.
896,"One of my all time fave games. Have it PS3, PS4, Xbox One X and now on PC"
897,"Absolutely love this game. first introduced to it on the 360 by a mate and still play it up until now. always bought on every console I've owned and as a result plenty of plenty hours. Definitely recommend to others, just an easy level up straight up shooter with millions of weapon choices to choose from. Cant go wrong with this"
898,it's fricking Borderlands dude.
899,"fine

900,i played this when it first came i had a blast
901,.
902,"pretty cool. lots of guns,"
903,"Great shooter! Enjoy
"
904,"Wow, 30 mins playing for the first time, really impressed and blown away for it's graphics during the 2009 era, still hold up in 2021, 12 years later feels like this is still a great game, can't wait to play through it now.  
Looks like a living comicbook.  I assume that these are the comicbook devs that did the Taletale games?
Feels like this game is like the original Mad Max movie meets Skyrim.
I really missed out not playing this game during release. But finally a game that gives me back that lil kid addiction videogame bug where i don't want to stop playing.  Something i struggle to find today due to an older age and an over-abundant amount of games in my digital & physical libraries.
*fingers crossed that this game is good till the end!

*Edit: 
80+ hours in, trying to do a hard completion of it, almost done the base game and i can't stop thinking about it, this was so addicting and satisfying of a game, so good and one of my fav shooters of all-time!

MUST-HAVE!"
905,very good i like has good guns and the quests are satisfiying tocomplete
906,why pay 80$ to play borderlands 3 when the first one is 7$ and better?
907,"classic great story and final boss is finally a challenge thank god, replay value the best i feel with newer games but still an amazing looter shooter

908,It's borderlands. Do I really need to say anything else?

918,better than the pre-sequel
919,I'd get the GOTY Enhanced.
920,very nice
921,"The Borderlands series is one of my top five gaming experiences of all time, and I couldn't recommend these games more. Some of the very best fun of my life has been in the Borderlands world, and the tens of thousands of guns and shields mean that there's always a much needed upgrade around the corner. This series is more addictive than a mixture of Haagen-Dazs ice cream, Nutella and coca_ne."
922,I go zoom around the land of borders
923,nice
924,Not a great game.
925,Best game ever!!!!!!

929,Pretty enjoyable once you get used to the idea that it's all about the grind.
930,Super fun looter and shooter--definitely one of my favorites
931,:)
932,Border but lands
933,"For the first installation of the Borderlands series it holds up in terms of gameplay but lacks the plot and world development of future installments. Still a good game, but best played with a friend as it can feel empty."
934,best borderlands game
935,its cool
936,
937,In terms of gameplay it was obviously more concerned with quantity than quality
938,"This is the best of the borderlands game in my experience

it's just aged the best in terms of writing and re-play ability

with it going on sale as often as it does you'd be silly not to try it"
939,Great game!
940,Awesome game. It's just a classic. The best shooter RPG in my opinion.
941,Good classic co-op fun with good classic fps gameplay and a silly story / world. Worth it if you want to play alongside a friend.
942,get it

951,just play 2
952,"The loot, story, mechanics, money, abilities, and everything in between makes this game something to behold. If you like mature but funny games, this is perfect. The versatility of each gun and its properties makes for a different playthrough every time. Highly recommend."
953,"This game was mind-blowing fun when it first came out, and it still holds its own. The online co-op gameplay experience is a super fun and the cel shaded art style really makes it feel like it's own genre. Prepare for analysis paralysis with the @#$% ton of weapons you will discover.

Do me a favor, do it, do it."
954,Great Game!
955,"schoost bang bang
Play with a full group of friends for best effect."
956,cool beans
957,"A great game for it's time.  For folks looking to get into Borderlands and wanting to see where it all came from this is still a good buy.  For everyone else you should prolly start at Borderlands 2.

You prolly know the drill.  Wacky humor, creative guns, lots of loot and lots of shoot :).  The sequels have more refined gameplay and lot and BL2 has the best story, but this is still a solid game."

961,"[i]It's Borderlands, but for high end computers![/i]"
962,just an overall fun game to play and enjoy the humor.

964,"Shoot, loot, repeat.

This simple formula has been the enjoyment of my life.
also key items not counting as inventory space is a godsend."
965,Borderlands never had any relevance for me it is ok to play on and off for the few past years
966,"I won't be touching at all on the enhanced version of this game as I've found it to not be up to par compared to the standard version. While it's very differently compared to the later entries in the series, Borderlands 1 has a very special charm to it for me. I think it comes from the less cartoon-y visual style while still having a bit of an older game feel to it. Everything about this game feels more serious, the environments, the difficulty of the enemies compared to other Borderlands games, the music, and even the story if you read into it more. This game to me is a classic that while maybe some won't return to because of how different it is, I for one will be returning. Just like with Borderlands 2, I have a lot of fond memories with this game which makes me more inclined to like it, but beyond personal biases, I think this game does have something special to offer.

9/10"
967,Good sountrack and introduction to the borderlands series.
968,Excellent open world game a huge weapon stat variety
969,Best way to play is loot-hobo runs with friends.
970,"Not going to lie, this game just hits the spot.
There's no huge and ""deeper"" plot like there is in the Borderlands 2, 3, or the Pre-sequel. 
It's just an old shooting game that brings so much joy.
Even after all those years you can still play and have fun. Even if you've never played this, you will still feel nostalgic.
This game is like an old friend. It will hug you in a warm cozy blanket, give you a drink and make the evening or night so much nicer.

981,"No idea why you are reading this, since I do not believe there is people who don`t know what Borderlands is. Also * cough - cough * enchanced version exists.

Wait, you still here and waiting? Sigh... okey, read away then...

Game is over a decade old, but still holds its ground, heck after a while you will not even think about its age. 
Visual design is basically timeless, humor is funny even after few playthroughs. 
If you have a friend to play with and you for some reason never played Borderlands, you should try it ( Well, honestly you can play this solo as well, but with friends it would be much more fun, its a Coop-rpg shooter after all ).

Downsides would be somewhat "" outdated "" game design choices, like lack of minimap or not enough checkpoints for fast travel, but then again, its not gamebreaking.

For those who want to achieve 100% completion, maybe the gods be with you. Clap-trap oiled panties and underdome will hunt you in your dream."
982,"Borderlands GOTY is a fantastic package containing the main game and all its DLC!

Graphics: Borderlands' cell-shaded graphics aged fantastically. There's a certain charm about the design of the characters and the world. The weapons and vehicles look awesome, and the game really makes you feel like you are in a wacky wasteland with its unique aesthetic. 

Story: The story is interesting at first but honestly becomes forgettable towards the end, especially with the horrible ending. I'm not going to spoil anything but the game's ending is one of the most disappointing endings I have ever experienced in my years playing games. Do not play this game for the story!

Sound: The sound is fantastic! Gunshots, voice acting, explosions and creatures all sound unique and believable. The music is somewhat lacking in novelty, most tracks sound the same but they still do a good job of fitting the world.

Gameplay: Now this is where the game shines. Borderlands is stupidly fun, especially with a friend. Shooting feels great, your special abilities are actually useful, driving is entertaining and the level up system is awesome. You really feel like you get stronger as you progress while game remains challenging and fair. Boss battles are really satisfying and the loot you find can either be kept or sold for cash.

Controls: The controls are perfect in my opinion. Everything is mapped perfectly on the controller and makes sense. The intuitive controls allow for gameplay to remain seamless and more enjoyable.

Verdict: 8.5 / 10

Borderlands is super fun! Gameplay and graphics are good and the sound is fantastic. The music score is forgettable but does the job even if the story was a complete failure. Despite this, I think everyone should try this game out and, if you can, get a buddy to join you on the adventure.

988,Holds up quite well over the years gone by.
989,"played it, deleted it, never returned to it. i know this might be the most unpopular review on steam, but i think the game is very overrated. it can be challenging and funny, and offers tons of weapons and fast pace shooting, which was entertaining until i got midway through the game. after that, it started to feel repetitive and boring and mindless. anyway, it's the kind of game you play once, and never play again. it's so forgettable and doesn't give me any reason to replay it."

I recommend this to anybody looking to try an exciting game that is fast paced, however over a long period of time because the game does take a while to finish. There are also great secrets and tons of different enemies.

There is nothing really negative to say about the game, it is still an excellent play in 2021 in my opinion and I do recommend buying it. Enjoy!!"

1008,"the original. not the best, but the baseline for games to come. buy it if you want to understand all the references in the second game (oh man there are a lot) and the dlcs are pretty fun, but otherwise just start with the second."
1009,"Easily one of the best video game soundtracks of all time.  I liked it so much I bought it on CD.

The game itself isn't bad, either.  It's a nice cell shaded looter shooter set on a backwater science fiction/fantasy world.  The graphics have aged quite gracefully other than a particle effect or two that betray their 2009 origins.  Unlike ...every iteration of this series after the first, Borderlands 1 is not stuffed to the gills with memes and cringe.  I really would love to play more of THIS world vs what Gearbox turned the, ahem, Borderlands Cinematic Universe into.  

Oh, you'll want a 3rd party launch options util (google it) that will allow you set a reasonable FoV and make a few other tweaks.  Armed with that, you'll have a fantastic game awaiting you."
1010,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1011,weiner!!!
1012,"I played the entirety of this game, but about 5 hours into it, the novelty of it the game play really wore off on me. After that, the game was sort of a lifeless grind.
Sure, the game works fine, the gameplay is works as you would expect, some characters are enjoyable. But the story is generic. And the aesthetic is blah - a reflection of the grey and brown revolution of the late 00s - early 10s. The core game just is not that fun to me - not recommended."

1056,"The game is not very good at balancing difficulty, either things are super easy and trivial, or they're pointlessly hard and frustrating. Not even in a fun way, where it pushes you to perform better, it's just about cheesing shit and getting out ASAP after finishing a quest."
1057,"-Cons-
The game is too easy; the only hard enemy type is the Crimson Lance

The DLC is laughably lackluster

The gameplay is hilariously repetitive

Story? I think the devs forgot about that except for when they rushed it at the last five quests

The game runs perfectly but then out of nowhere the last 10 quests all had frequent bugs

Loot is good but the legendaries are unbelievably underwhelming

Enemy variety is lacking

Quest design is almost entirely one of the following: grab item(s) (fetch quest), kill enemies, kill boss, or kill enemy type for item drop (fetch quests again)

Movement is awkward. If you use A or D to turn while sprinting sometimes you will randomly stop sprinting and other times you keep going

World feels completely dead. The only activities to do in the game is kill and loot. No puzzle dungeons, secrets, lore to discover, etc.

Most of the bosses are just reskinned enemy types, leaving the lack of enemy variety problem mentioned before to be even more of an issue.

The final boss is pathetic and the ending is woefully underwhelming.

The render distance is comparable to Pokemon Sword and Shield (for those who don't know, that is really REALLY bad), I see flowers and grass literally sprout into existence in front of me.

The leveling system is terrible. After level 20, I am overleveled compared to every enemy. (In some cases, up to 5 levels overleveled, and I have 1-5 shot bosses)

Once you defeat the final boss in the 2nd Playthrough, there is an UNHOLY difficulty spike. I was level 55 when I did this and all of the enemies are at least level 56

Most of the areas (mostly towards the middle of the game) are very samey.

The cars..... I hate them. The physics are wonky and it barely has any health so you explode and get downed a lot. So you either go into a car and risk being set back or run and take forever. My character has double the amount of hit points compared to my car and does triple the damage.

-Neutral-
The Gunplay is alright

-Pros-
The skill tree and class mods are fun to use.

Weapon Proficiencies are rewarding and fun to level up.

Fight For Your Life is an interesting and fun mechanic. (Instead of dying when your health reaches 0 you go down and can get a kill to get back up or get revived by a teammate. The more times you go down consecutively in a fight, the shorter the bleedout timer is before death.)

-Conclusion-
I could never under any circumstance recommend this game"
1058,"This was were it started and was a great wow effect. 

If you are new to Borderlands start here, then go Borderlands 2, skip presequel its garbage and jump to Borderlands 3 (once price drops.

Good series overall despite developers not fixings bugs for years or at all and generally us having to wait for full release to get a decent price."

You Just

- Collect guns

- Collect better guns
- Kill bigger things.

And there's nothing more amazing than the lighthearted pleasure of setting a half-naked psychopath on fire with a sniper rifle while screaming the chorus for ""Light My Fire"" in the middle of the night.

Get this game."
1065,Fun.
1066,"It is entertaining.  There are a lot of things to do in the game.  Story lines to follow and other content to build your supplies such as weapons, armor, and ammunition.  Its fun."
1067,satisfaction
1068,good
1069,"Even though Borderlands 2 is a lot better, I think fans of Borderlands franchise should play it. It can explain some story plot points, it has fun quests and being this the original, it has it's own charm to it. I recommend it."
1070,"While this was a game that caused the rest of the franchise to develop into the game it is today, this game really isn't that great. It was a game that did not age well with time, and only got one or two updates in terms of fixes. Even still this game has a lot of issues that I would say isn't worth the time to be invest it in. I would only play this game if your interested in the lore of what happened before borderlands 2 and to know what the characters were like, that is mostly it."
1071,"The Big Daddy of Looter Shooters.

This game is so good in co-op that you couldn't tell that this was a game released in 2009.
So if you have at least one other friend, just buy this and prepare to sink 50+ hours in this old beautiful masterpiece."
1072,"Got it for 1 dollar. Worth the price for how much I paid. However, the navigation system is terrible. If you want to buy this game, make sure you have friends to play with, or just buy the sequeal, which improves a lot."
1073,SO MANY GUNS. So much Blood. SO MANY MEAT TARGETS!
1074,"Great game, recomended"
1075,"good game, good story. I remember getting stuck on 1 mission and I have absolutely no clue how to get past it as you need to be sneaky but there's not many hiding places. don't like the map system"

1079,Dated but still generally pretty fun
1080,great rpg great fps
1081,euh this game becomes a chore to play very quickly. A fun chore though like vacuum cleaning
1082,"One of my favourite games. After having played Borderlands 2, I can say that Borderlands 1 is way better. The environments, the gunplay, the story, the level design, the enemies, even the classes are better. It is the perfect game. I could spend my life in the Arid Badlands.

Tell me if you agree."
1083,is good
1084,the start of an awesome franchise.
1085,Borderlands is lit
1086,"enjoyable solo or  split screen local co-op. online play with like minded friends only! some online players just want to ruin your game with OP mods :( 
this is one of those games where I didn't care for #2 and am not interested in buying #3 . other family members and friends loved #2, just not my choice.
"
1087,"My second encounter with the gearbox looter shooter. BL2 is one of my favorite games and definitely my favorite looter shooter franchise. This one is not quite as good but i can see the precursor of what lead to that game. 7,5/10"
1088,"Borderlands is an incredibly good game. The soundtrack fits perfectly with the theme, the game play is fun and challenging, the characters aren't too bland. All around awesome. That being said, this game does come with it's fair share of bugs and glitches. 

For those who receive a ""general protection fault"" error upon trying to launch the game for the first time, here's how you can fix it.

1. Go to your Steam library, right click on Borderlands, and then click on properties.
2. Go to the local files tab, then select browse local files.
3. Open the folder labelled, ""binaries,"" and find a file called, ""cudart.dll""
4. Copy the cudart.dll file, rename it to ""physxcudart_20""
5. Launch the game.

I don't really know how or why this happens/why this fix works, but here you go. I found this information [url=https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/borderlands-goty-general-protection-fault-is-there-a-fix#:~:text=The%20Borderlands%20GOTY%20General%20Protection%20Fault%20error%20fix%20requires%20you,where%20the%20game%20is%20installed.]here.[/url] Happy vault hunting. 

"
1089,"It's good. My only complaint is that there is no FOV slider in the settings and the default FOV is gobshite.
However with some clever code rewriting you can set it up so when you press a key it will set the FOV to a particular value.
Unfortunately when ever you exit a vehicle this gets reset, meaning every time you have to press that key again to set the FOV again.

Gearbox is lucky I am a patient man who can put up with this."
1090,I love this game so much. Borderlands 3 is garbage. please make games like this again. It sucks having everything updated every week. I just want to play an open world shoot and loot game like this. HELL YEAH!
1091,"As a single player .... game play was very repetitive. Every time came out of the ""base"" had to shoot the same NPCs. Good effort, but not for me."
1092,"Nobody likes having the inferior version of a game. 

Borderlands is a game praised for its co-operative experience. However, as the only of my friends with a gaming PC, I don't have the same opportunity that console users have. Split-screen on PC has reached the same accessibility as consoles through Steam remote play, the Steam link, the many controller options, yet the games that boast multiplayer options lack a trait that should be the standard.

I cannot, in good conscience, recommend a multiplayer game that doesn't allow actual access to reliable multiplayer."
1093,"I played with friends (3-4 persons, depending who could join at the moment). Great game."
1094,god game
1095,Classic.
1096,awesome first game in series..and still fun as hell
1097,Knox's armoury is the reason why the youth dont want to sex because after you get your first pearl everything is meaningless
1098,"I remember playing this game on an old prebuilt HP computer with no graphics card at 1 frame every 1.5 second and had a good time, actually managing to get through the story and 2 of the DLCs. It is very worth buying."
1099,█▍◤
1100,still a fun game to play
1101,".
"
1102,This game has helped me appreciate all the quality of life improvements in the second one.
1103,"Very good game, especially with friends. Although I recommand the enhanced edition for full steam acheivements and friends list integration."
1104,"this game takes place, in arizona and has many baddies living there. there is strong language and lots of hysteria. be careful with your weapons as they have no safety in this universe."
1105,"This game is a great game. It does show its age these days, but it is still a great game. From my perspective, if this isn't the first major game to bring the Diablo-style loot system and RPG elements to a shooter game, then it is the game that kicked off a whole craze of similar games because it proved that it can work when done correctly.

For story value, it still holds some and should be enjoyable. For me though...it's pure nostalgia."
1106,"9/10. It's super fun and super action packed, the stories are great, there are goofy quests which can make the game kinda long if you're a completionist but I love easter eggs!"
1107,good game give me something
1108,A great game that I played initially on the ps3. Has a good variety of classes and guns to BLAM enemies with. Generally improved upon by the second game although also not as LULRANDOM in its humor. Also lilith OP.
1109,As far as I'm concerned this and the second one are the only ones that exist because they are IMO the best games I've ever played. Could some things be better sure I wish that Gearbox had totally embraced mods so we could have fresh new content but oh well....
1110,"Hehe, gun go bang bang!"
1111,This game is really fun but i would recommend playing Borederlands 2 before this
1112,"Very nice game, the art-style is really unique and comic book like, one of the best looter shooter games and kinda well balanced and you can even play up with 4 friends as a plus, not much bad things to say about this game. The characters and the world building is really great."
1113,"A decently fun intro into the Borderlands universe. The game starts painfully slow and boring as it forces you to backtrack through the same 4 areas over and over, but once you got that out of the way you enter a wide open world with different questing paths to explore (or all of them , if you are a completionist). Whether you want to snipe rakks from a distance, play a cover based shooter or just want to punch a boss to death with your fists, there is something for any type of gameplay.

Unfortunately the AI of the enemies is slightly lower than that of a mud brick. They will make no attempts to position themselves behind sensible cover or try to outmanoever you. Instead they will stand there, maybe waddle over to you at a snails pace, and fire at your general area. If you hide behind cover, they will shoot blindly against it. if you throw a grenade at them, they will accept their impending doom. If you rush at them with a shotgun or melee attacks, they will do a little startling animation but then stand their ground some more. This AI combined with some really strong defensive perks will make you night invincible later down the line. Early game bosses will be difficult, but after that you can pretty much steamroll anything that comes across your path.

The DLC was hit or miss. The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned and Claptrap's Robot Revolution were really fun to play through, but the Secret Armory of General Knoxx and Moxxi's Underdome Riot felt like pulling hen's teeth. I mean, what is fun about a DLC where you drive around for 15 minutes because there are no fast travel points, or a DLC where you farm boring arenas for a pittance of money and a Steam achievement? Both of those are a ""do not pick up"" advice from me.

Overall, the game was pretty fun. Not amazing, but it kept me enticed enough to want to keep playing. It has its faults, but none of them ruined the experience too much. You just have to force yourself through the first couple of boring hours."
1114,"It's basically Diablo, if Diablo was Mad Max in space."
1115,"This is the only borderlands game without memes, and coincidentally the only good one."
1116,"I ain’t gonna bite, pro’ly

I was concerned that I might not like BORDERLANDS, as I’ve played games with stylised graphics before and have found this type of design can reduce the immersive qualities that I love about gaming. I need not have worried. Borderlands is one of the best games I’ve played. The visuals are very impressive and suck you right in. This is open-world gaming at it’s best, with many large maps to explore as you complete the numerous missions. There are hundreds of weapons to collect and use, or sell along the way (gathering loot quickly becomes addictive). A wide variety of enemies will take you on as you progress up the levels. The combat is varied and the AI is good if not exceptional. Although there’s little story to speak of there’s enough humour to just about make up for this. It’s possible that some might find the missions a tad repetitive but I was so engrossed in the game that I didn’t tire of them and completed every one, including the 3 DLCs available. As for multi-player, well co-op is great fun but best played with people who you can rely on to share the loot."
1117,"better than enhcanced!

"
1118,Its one of my favorites
1119,Still a fantastic game until this day in 2020
1120,h
1121,2/5
1122,"Very good, and still funny!"
1123,"Yes.. Well.. Played The Borderlands ONE.. before et became GOTY Edition.

It is one of the best games, ever. :)

!"
1124,awtur ta' ksur tas-sess
1125,"Good game, the two major points that make it unique are:
The Graphics and the general style. This is quite obvious. The Cel-Shading looks good and helps that, although this game is over a decade old, it still looks decent today as this style is relatively timeless. This is combined with a lot of humor and funny (sometimes actually funny, sometimes wannabe funny) dialogues and comments by the characters. This game does not take itself seriously and also jokes about other major products in the entertainment business.
The second special thing about Borderlands is its loot-based gameplay. At the time it was released, this was new to the shooter genre. It is based on the random drops of RPGs, with probabilities, different combined properties and various rarenesses. So you can get easily sucked into the spiral of trying to grind for better gear and more unique and legendary items.
So all in all, you can describe Borderlands as a mix of a shooter and an RPG. If you like any of those genres and you are not driven away by the graphical style, this might fit you well.
Apart from the looting, there is not much that makes you keep on playing. The story is a massive letdown and the missions are horrible. All of them have you run around in order to collect 10 of those items or 20 of these parts. Alternatively you have to go somewhere far away to activate a switch or open a door and kill a boss.
So if you are a player that enjoys good stories and who wants them in every game, you should pass on this one.
Finally, there are 4 DLCs for Borderlands:
Zombie Island (good)
Underdome Riot (bad)
Secret Armory (mediocre)
Claptrap Robolution (good)
Overall, the GOTY edition is worth buying as the first and the last DLC are actually quite enjoyable."
1126,"Definitely very innovative for when this game came out with it's wonderful blend of the FPS and RPG genre. I played so much of this when it originally came out on the PS3. This plays virtually the same but with the option of playing with either controller or mouse and keyboard. The big downside with this game for me is I have never been motivated enough to play through the story due to the NPCs not having much life to them. Some of the intros are interesting enough but more often they are just used to issue various quests to give you XP and items and move the story forward. Despite this, there is a lot of fun to be had, especially with online co-op. Personally I would skip it and go right to the second title as they fill you in on the events so there is very little that you will be lost on if you go into it blindly. I still recommend it though as it's still a classic! I would just wait until it's on sale if you're going to do so!"
1127,"Well, a shooter with MMORPG elements, which I'm not really fan of. It seems to be fun game for those, who like looting or leveling up. Also, not being able to kill ememy with headshot is not acceptable."
1128,"I'm well aware that many consider Borderlands 2 to be the gold standard of the series, but for me, nothing can replace the original, and that's for one simple reason: scaling.
Put simply, Borderlands 1 makes you and enemies tougher at a fixed rate, whereas Borderlands 2 gets exponentially larger numbers. This means that there is no point in Borderlands 1 where a single level between you and the target becomes a make-or-break moment. For some people, this is a downside. For me, it means that the game provides more of a freedom to do the missions YOU want, than the later titles can ever provide.
It's for this simple reason that Borderlands 1 encourages being bold through its mechanics better than any other BL game. You CAN challenge enemies that are tougher than you if you are smart about it. You CAN avoid hugging the meta and just pick skills and weapons that you enjoy using. The game makes you feel free, more capable of playing the way you like and using the guns you want. In a game full of sand, Pandora is your sandbox. And that's what keeps me playing 1 over and over."
1129,... Aaand opened !
1130,"Fantastic game, Really unique and timeless. If you enjoy this one, go ahead and play through the 2nd one as well."
1131,old but gold
1132,"The game that started it all, one I have played many times over again. One of the best co-op games ever made with great fps goodness for its time. This game is so good it pushed the looter genre of gaming into the mainstream. If you love any looter shooter games or skipped over this game then its worth going back to."
1133,"the classic, never gets old, also if you play commando you basically get unlimited ammo and I missed that from bl2"
1134,good
1135,"good looter shooter with great gear and replayability
"
1136,fun
1137,"it's borderlands, c'mon dude.
a good portion of the jokes fucking suck and are tasteless as hell nowadays because back in 2008 is was funny to make fun of people that weren't normal. thank god we're past that. 
gameplay's fun, music is top tier, if you need yourself a space-wild-west lootem-shootem RPG, this is 30 bucks well spent. 
try to get some friends to play it with though."
1138,"Works beautifully in Linux using the latest Proton. This game is a co-op staple in my house, highly recommend for anyone who likes to game together."
1139,mediocre and full of bugs
1140,"This is the peak of the Borderlands series, the first, and the best."
1141,Love it!
1142,Amazing shooters game. I never get tired of playing through the numerous missions.
1143,yep
1144,MAD MOXXI’S UNDERDOME RIOT IN SINGLE PLAYER MOD IS TRYING ANAL INTERCOURSE WITH SOMEONE WHO IS 400 POUNDS CAW CAW
1145,Just as fun as it was back in the day even tho some jokes didn't age so well and are a bit childish.
1146,"I mean it's Borderlands, yea of course it's good."
1147,The OG
1148,The Vault part 1.
1149,"I skipped Borderlands back in the day when I heard it had leveling and inventory management. If you start putting RPG elements into an FPS, the shooting will enevitable suffer, right?

Wrong! When I did finally pick it up, I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun the combat loop is. Different skills and weapons drastically alter how combat plays out, and I'm having tons of fun experimenting with different combinations of characters, skills, weapons and other equipment. Depending on you build, you'll want to run into the enemy's faces to keep up a kill streak that will keep you alive, or keep your distance and taking out foes strategicaly while avoiding damage, or bait them to bunch up all around you to trigger your area of effect skill, or other variants I haven't gotten to try out yet.

The story and atmosphere are also quite immersive. Unlike in other mission driven games, I've not only enjoyed the story missions, but the side missions, as well. They actually add a lot to the game world, and some of them even flesh out the main story.

All in all, I heartily recommend this game, both for the gun play and the story."
1150,"nice

"
1151,god tier
1152,yeetz
1153,HEEEEELLLLL FUCKIN YEAH I RECOMMEND THIS CLASSIC ALWAYS
1154,the original and the best what can I say
1155,This is a great shoot and loot game.  IMO the loot drops are fairly generous and the level advancement is well balanced.  Character development is not as open as in some other games but the class mods and elemental artifacts make up for this.  The missions are well designed; there are plenty of them and they are varied enough so the enemies will probably still surprise you on subsequent play throughs.  This is currently my favorite shooter/looter!
1156,Feels like it took me way too long to finish because of multi-year hiatus but it was still enjoyable.
1157,Gud
1158,yes
1159,Nice game
1160,"I played it long ago with some online friends. When we parted ways, I parted company with Borderlands. Far too dystopic and jarring for my taste.

BUT, the opening sequence...very very cool. 

Look at me! I'm dancing. I'm dancing."
1161,"THIS GAME GUD
"
1162,5/10 - I'm not a big fan of the FPS genre. I like them if they offer something special like a great single player story or special RPG elements on the side. This game was difficult and tedious for me. I also don't particularly enjoy the graphic style. It may be fun playing online if you are a fan of FPS games.
1163,GOOD NICE
1164,"This game is a classic. I will post a full review later. Worth a purchase, (unlike the enhanced edition which is garbage) regardless of it being on sale. That is an exceedingly rare thing from me, as >90% of all games get a trash rating from me.

Borderlands is a rare gem, one whose legacy has carried a solid; yet arguably stale and rotting franchise for a very long time. Without reservation I can say  that the franchise hasn't produced anything this truly fetching since. The original Borderlands is an essential in any gamers collection."
1165,Yes
1166,Game still fun despite being over a decade old.
1167,Love the story
1168,It's great.
1169,out of all the borderlands this one was the best no way u can compare it to 2 prequel or 3 because this one was amazing

Borderlands Game of the Year is an Action shooter developed by Gearbox Software.

[h1] Gameplay / Story [/h1]

Borderlands is characterized by a dark and dirty graphic style reminiscent of cel-shading with strong contrasts and many effects, which makes for a slightly surreal look. Since the game contains drastic depictions of violence in the original version, it was cut accordingly for the German market.

Pandora is a desolate planet with cynical inhabitants who eke out their existence in the midst of deserts, destruction, monsters and mountains of rubbish. The game world and the characters living in it are deliberately exaggerated and clichéd, black and crude humor are predominant.

The story leads the player from the village of Fyrestone over vast wastelands, dusty deserts and rugged mountain regions towards the chamber. He also visits the capital of the planet, New Haven, and later even attacks an outpost of the Crimson Lance, a heavily armed special unit. The game begins with a brief introduction to the four playable characters: Brick, Lilith, Roland and Mordecai. These four so-called ""exterminators"" take a bus to Fyrestone. As soon as you have chosen your character, Angel appears. She introduces herself as the protector of the chamber. She guides you through the game by advancing the story and helping you find the key to the chamber. It charges by itself every 200 years, so time is short to find the parts.

[h1] Pro [/h1]

+ effective end times atmosphere
+ good playing time
+ cool comic art design
+ many weapons are available to you
+ crisp firefights, meaningful critical hits

- Monotonous rummaging through always the same orders
- dreary scenes

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Borderlands Game of the Year turned out to be a good shooter, which stands out above all for its appearance. Unfortunately, there is a little lack of variety. Still, this game is fun and worth every penny. Clear buy recommendation.


[h1] Information / Review Deutsch [/h1]

Borderlands Game of the Year ist ein Action-Shooter, welcher von Gearbox Software entwickelt wurde. 

[h1] Gameplay / Geschichte [/h1]

Borderlands zeichnet ein düsterer und schmutziger, an Cel-Shading erinnernder Grafikstil mit starken Kontrasten und vielen Effekten aus, was für einen leicht surrealen Look sorgt. Da das Spiel in der Originalversion drastische Gewaltdarstellungen enthält, wurde es für den deutschen Markt entsprechend geschnitten. 

Pandora ist ein trostloser Planet mit zynischen Bewohnern, die inmitten von Wüsten, Zerstörung, Monstern und Müllbergen ihr Dasein fristen. Die Spielwelt und die in ihr lebenden Charaktere sind gezielt überspitzt und klischeehaft, schwarzer und kruder Humor sind vorherrschend.

Die Story führt den Spieler von der Ortschaft Fyrestone über weite Ödnis, staubige Wüsten und zerklüftete Gebirgsregionen in Richtung Kammer. Hierbei besucht er auch die Hauptstadt des Planeten, New Haven, und attackiert später sogar einen Außenposten der Crimson Lance, einer schwerbewaffneten Spezialeinheit. Das Spiel beginnt mit einer kurzen Vorstellung der vier spielbaren Charaktere: Brick, Lilith, Roland und Mordecai. Diese vier sogenannten „Kammerjäger“ fahren mit einem Bus nach Fyrestone. Sobald man seinen Charakter ausgewählt hat, erscheint Angel. Sie stellt sich als Beschützerin der Kammer vor. Sie leitet durch das Spiel, indem sie die Story vorantreibt und bei der Suche nach dem Schlüssel zur Kammer hilft. Dieser lädt sich alle 200 Jahre von selbst auf, die Zeit ist also knapp, die Teile zu finden.

[h1] Pro [/h1]

+ wirkungsvolle Endzeit-Atmosphäre

+ viele Waffen stehen dir zur Auswahl
+ knackige Feuergefechte, sinnvolle Kritische Treffer

[h1] Fazit [/h1]

Borderlands Game of the Year ist guter Shooter geworden, der vor allem durch Optik hervor sticht. An Abwechslung fehlt es aber leider ein wenig. Trotzdem macht dieses Spiel Spaß und ist jeden Cent wert. Klare Kaufempfehlung."
1173,Fun to play
1174,"The OG Borderlands, and the beginning of it's absolutely glorious stupidity.
It's a very good game from 2009 that was definitely lacking in certain ways that the sequels then improved upon, but it  still does offer a rather enjoyable time thanks to the humor and the fun gameplay it has. Just remember that this was basically Gearbox testing the Borderlands formula and don't judge it too harshly if you have played the other ones first. As a tip, the whole game is way better with friends, if possible, as sometimes it can get pretty dull alone but just messing around with a friend or 2/3 can make it worth the while. Also, the best stuff is almost all in the DLCs, so I'd recommend playing those (especially the Secret Armory of General Knoxx and the Zombie Island of Dr. Ned).

I don't have that many hours on the game on Steam, but I played the hell out of it back on Xbox 360 and loved it to bits, but it can be hard to get into it after playing Borderlands 2 or any of the other ones, which are all basically better in almost every way. So think it through before deciding, this title is skippable if you really don't feel like playing it first and just want to jump into Borderlands 2 straight away."
1175,One of the best coops ever created. Is funny playing alone but if you get a trio of friends this is just tha sh*t
1176,"This game is an exercise in frustration. It's devoid of life, memorable or funny characters, good quest design, or fun weapons. The majority of the game you will be using garbage whites-blues. Near the end of the game, the drop rates get better, but it is far from enough to remedy the god-awful quest design. 99% of the missions consist of: 1. Go to place. 2. Press e on object 3. Leave 

If it isn't that, then it's a boring as all hell kill X amount of enemy that you've already seen 1000 times. 

As far as DLC's go, I can at least recommend the Zombie Island DLC as it is at least somewhat of a departure from the slog that is the rest of the game. The other DLC's are pretty awful, unfortunately. Most of them just recycle old assets and barely add anything new. The Secret Armory dlc is designed so badly it's appalling. Most of your time will be sent driving back and forth on the same empty roads because they opted not to add fast travel points to any location but the starting area. 

My last major issue with the game is the balancing. I've played through the game enough to get every achievement, which includes playing each class. These classes are beyond poorly balanced. Lilith is blatantly better than the other 3, (especially Brick). Roland is pretty terrible up until the end, and even then he falls flat compared to Lilith. Mordecai is passable, but very very boring. 

I can't speak to the other version of this game, but this port is riddled with technical issues and bugs. Some areas of the game run at double digit frames despite my rig being well beyond what the game requires. 

Just avoid this shit and play a better game."
1177,is gud
1178,"[h1]Ain't No Rest For The Wicked[/h1]
Having played through all of the original on the 360, don't let my playtime here fool you as I was glued to my TV for hours upon hours at the time. The first in the beloved series of looter-shooters, Borderlands was truly a unique and special shooter at the time of its release. At a time where everyone was buzzing for realistic modern military shooters such as Bad Company 2 and Modern Warfare 2, here came a brand new IP from Gearbox with stylised cell-shaded visuals (albeit duller), a bazillion guns and some charming, humorous characters! 

Now if you've already played the other games in the series, I wouldn't really recommend jumping back to the original unless you're REALLY big on the lore and story of the series. Hell, your playable characters here which later become series mainstays in the sequels are silent for the most part with no discernible personality. The humour and jokes here however are great - more blunt, direct in terms of its shock-value which i appreciate more so than the memey, cultural references the sequels (especially 3) tend to go for.

Of course what ultimately matters to most is  how the gameplay goes; and it's an absolute ball. If you've played the others, you'll know what you're getting into with that classic Shoot n' Loot style of gunplay, picking out between the rarity and stats of your guns, and customising your perks with the skill tree system. Overall though , it's just not as deep nor refined as its sequels, the skill system is pretty surface level leaving a greater emphasis on FPS play which also feel clunkier than the sequels. 

If you've played 2 or 3, you won't be missing much at all by skipping out on this , however if you're looking to get into the series - this is a great pickup on sale."

1187,"ive been playing this game for years, i started on the xbox360 and then switched to computer. This is one of my favorite game series."
1188,"Borderlands 1 is my second favorite Borderlands game (#1 is actually Pre-Sequel). The gameplay itself has aged a bit but there will always be something really special about the more minimal tone and atmosphere from this entry before the series went even more crazy, and this one is already pretty wild. At this point I'd say you should probably get the Enhanced Edition, but if the truer, more original experience is what you're after then you'll have a good time with this one too."

1202,"Honestly the most grounded borderlands out there, it keeps the gunplay simple while adding enough variety with the elements and weapons to keep you invested in fights, the atmosphere is gritty and bland which adds to its charm, and the jokes aren't shoved into your face like later installments. if you want to play borderlands at its core this is the one."

1238,"I was introduced to the first borderlands game a long time ago but never got into it since, at the time, all I ever wanted to play was multiplayer games ans since the online servers were not active on playstation 3 I didn't bother to play it. However, I got to play the other games in the series such as the second borderlands, the pre-sequel, and the recent one, the third one. Let me tell you that you can truly see the effort that the creators behind the games have put so much into it, seeing the growth of them as a company. These games are, and will always, be one of my top favorite games to play. I recommend it to those that enjoy playing a mindless, first-person shooter, where you level up throughout completing quests, little challenges, or just killing enemies. The story itself is interesting, especially with the dialog that they used. The loot you get in the first one does no match your level always but some of it does help. And the area in which you are in is not as colorful compared to the other games. But overall, combining all of the hours from each game I must have put at least 1000 hours into it (I played it on console more than I did on PC at this current moment of writing this)"
1239,"loved it, fresh and fun"

1246,"It is a fast paced, FPS that doesn't take itself too seriously."
1247,"Imo, Borderlands (Original, GOTY) isn't a very good game.  I pre-ordered this game on release, and I never got around to finishing it.  

However, when they released GOTY Enhanced, I did wind up doing a complete play-through and it was bearable.  Just keep in mind Borderlands 2, TPS, and 3 are much better game play wise.  GOTY Enhanced takes the quality of life improvements from the later series and puts it to the original story.  If you started a character on this version, you can import it to the GOTY Enhanced, which I highly recommend doing.  This version is completely outdated, and feels like a slog across a desert rather than a treasure hunting adventure."
1248,"I love this game for all the reasons other people dislike it. I like the lack of any colour other than brown, I hate loot, I like that its humour is subdued. I mostly play the game for the boring parts."

""So anyway I started blastin'"""
1253,"Ratatatatatatatatatata

Most people who like shooters, especially if they play with friends, will have fun with Borderlands. First in the series and I believe first looter shooter in general is still solid in many aspects, the characters look and act wacky, the music is in the background, but fits the post-apo Australia-ish looking planet Pandora. With levels shooting up, and new shooting sticks popiing out of boxes constantly, the gameplay loop should keep people hooked and wanting for more.
That being said, I do feel like the whole thing in the back of your head is feeling dull after a while, even if you continue playing it. Once I finished my playthrough, I barely ever wanted to go back to it. Some very attached fans would probably want to hang me for saying that, and that's ok, I'm glad this series can give some people even more enjoyment than me.

The visuals are showing the age, it is very often said that cartoony cel-shaded looks hold up the longest, however I can see a clear difference between this and newer BL games. A lot of the outlines are low res and jaggy, while colors are muted for a huge part of the game, even in some of the more unique areas, while the collor palette is different, it is still limited in its own right. It's not a downright ugly game to look at, but it wasn't a visual feast in my opinion either. Animations were not blowing me away either, throughout the game.

The sounds are alright, but just as I mentioned with my review of Dragons Dogma, after so many hours, some of the sounds are drilled to my brain. Basic shooting and reloading sound of every god damn weapon type in the game, the experiments with the weapon system started in later games, here I don't remember that many unique weapons, besides some of the alien ones, and infinite ammo automatic pistol. I did not feel like the sounds were outstanding, but they weren't annoying too, it's just the matter of playtime that causes some of them to drill their way in your precious brain space.

Story is kinda weak, it mostly stays in te background, with some occasional more important story related dungeon, though I struggle to remember much more beyond the ones near the ending. It's not offensive and insufferable like BL3, but it's nowhere close to a strong story with a nice villain like BL2. The devs focused on world building a lot, the companies with their weapons and vending machines are actual characters, with how their marketing is done, logs thrown around the place, adding background to some of the characters, crazy cannibals screaming hungry noises when running at you. Quite a few of the set pieces created here are really memorable, one of the fans favorite is the claptrap robots, while there is already a big amount of comedy, those guys are usually comic relief times 2 or 3.

As for mechanics, they are pretty solid when it comes to shooting, big and growing damage numbers and some status effects thrown in, perks and special abilities to make the thing more varied. For bigger distances you also get to ride vehicles, and do some stunts with them on the way somewhere. The polish is really good, but it's a very tired loop by the end, after some tens of hours, it's just going forward and doing ratatatatatatata, just like the first line of the review says. The brain is not stimulated besides rewarding your efforts with new stuff to look through and compare with what you have. The enemies are not completely braindead like in serious sam, they go for covers and run to sides to dodge, but the triggers for those actions seem often random. The first thing reminds you to use grenades sometimes to make things quicker, while other works like moving targets at a shooting range. There really isn't a lot here, the pure looter-shooter, you shoot and loot, while getting new quest markers from NPCs along the way.

There is a good amount of stuff to like here, but when you boot it up to play, you will still have to go ratatatatatatatata for a long time."

"
1270,"I have never played borderlands games before, so I decided to start from the first one. Pretty interesting game. It is sort of rpg because the enemies and you have levels, you always have to get better guns an so on. Jokes inside the game are very funny, especially claptrap's dancing. Shooting in this game is very comfortable. Soundtrack and graphics are also ok. However, there is almost no story in this game. You are just told that you are searching for some vault, and that's all. In general, I give it 8/10."
1271,"This game was one of the first games I bought here on steam, eight years ago and finally, finnally i finish this game...
It was a great game setting in a apocalse world were you take the role of one of four characters, everyone with different abilites and different gameplay so it have a great replay value. This game have RPG elements and first person shooter mix together and can by played togher with a friend on co-op (I never tried because my friends dont have this game :( )
The story is a little bit meh with ending a little dissappointment.
So i with gave this game a 8/10."

1286,"One of my favorite games of all time, I didn't expect it to enjoy it as much as I loved BL2 , I love the immersive nature of this game and how it keeps you hooked even when there isn't much going on.  My only complaints are the purchase mechanics in the ammo and health vending machines cos i gotta confirm every time i wanna buy a consumable and the lack of a Field of View setting. I also wish there were more than 1 fast travel per DLC , specifically Doctor Ned's Zombie Island and the Secret Armory of General Knoxx.
9.7/10 game"

1301,"Really not worth it for SP. It all looks the same, the weapons in part are very very samy and boring, sometimes fast travel, not so in DLC, a really fucking rushed ending, really slow walking speed, some one shot killing enemies (depending on level) when you really *shouldn't* expect it. It absolutely isn't well optimized or even well ported. There is no excuse for that. Fixed FOV, lol. Man..."
1302,"One of the best games I've ever played as a multiplayer with Friends.

This game is fun alone but much much better to play with a small group you know.

The story is quirky and fun and the Characters are well designed and memorable.  The gameplay is pretty solid for the most part and the cell shading is designs hold up well considering how old this game is.

The expansions that are included are a bit hit or miss imo but overall worth spending time doing.  

I would recommend this to anyone that like playing a game with a couple mates.

1315,"I was concerned that I might not like Borderlands due to its stylized graphics, but my worries were unfounded: Borderlands is one of the best games I have ever played!
It is a truly interactive, funny and epic game, with some of the best gameplay from a RPFPS I have ever seen.

The visuals are very impressive and will have you hooked. This is open-world gaming at its best, with many large maps to explore as you complete the numerous missions. There are hundreds of weapons to collect and use, or sell along the way (you will become a real hoarder by gathering all that loot). A wide variety of enemies will take you on as you progress up the levels. The combat is varied and the AI is good if not exceptional. The controls are very suitable for the game, which is one of the main things you are looking for in a video game. The story is enthralling and will keep you excited.

It’s possible that some might find the missions a tad repetitive but there’s enough humor to make up for this. Also, you will be so engrossed in the game that you won’t tire of them and you will complete every quests, including the 3 DLCs available, without being aware of it. As for the multiplayer, Borderlands’ co-op is really fun and is even better when played with friends.

As the first game of the series, Borderlands establishes itself well enough with a fun gameplay, tons of variety, and a masterclass of DLCs which I would argue has still not been replicated fully to this day. This game has so much replay value that you will never get bored of it! I highly recommend it!"
1316,i liked everything and disliked nothing but some things
1317,6/10

1319,
1320,Its a classic. What more can I say?
1321,"One time I was playing Pathfinder as a merchant character and the DM made my follower TK Baha. TK let my shop burn down and proceeded to crash my hopes of ever doing business again.

Once I finally got past that and played the game, I had a good time. Combat is alright, character trees are so-so, but the dialogue, interactions and the setting are what really make the game come to life. Game's worth trying for sure, just stay away from TK Baha. That guy's a jerk."
1322,"Does not hold up quite as well today, but still pretty decent due to the graphics style."
1323,"Let's talk about Borderlands. This is where it all started — Borderlands 1. I remember getting this game a long long time ago. I think it was relatively soon after it came out, probably in 2010 on PS3. It feels like FOREVER has passed since then, but this game still holds up really really well. Out of the whole series so far (up to 3, in case more come out in the future), Borderlands 1 might still be my favorite. Borderlands 2 is a close second, but Borderlands 1 still comes out ahead if you ask me. I loved literally everything about it. I played as Mordecai my first time through and love him and his pet, Bloodwing. Although now I think he is definitely one of if not the worst character(s) of them all in terms of usability. That should go to show just how amazing Borderlands is though. Even with the worst character of all the games, I had some of the best moments in my gaming history with him. I cherish the memories I had while playing him. Later I tried Lilith out, and she is my favorite character in any game, hands down, no contest. I also think she happens to be the most powerful as well. I can say from plenty of experience that she is just as fun as Mordecai was. In fact, I've tried all the characters multiple times, and they are all so much fun to play. No one does the Shoot & Loot genre better than Borderlands. This, if I had to make a list, would 100% be a staple game I recommend to anyone starting video games. Please, buy this game and try it if you haven't. Especially when you have friends to play with, this game is truly mind-blowing, especially for its time."
1324,i played 10 years . my best game in world is borderlands 1 and i love it.
1325,"What's up, I played borderlands when it came out and I think I beat it? I don't remember but I [i] do [/i] remember playing it with friends and that was the best part. The chaos and goofy teamwork worked really well because this game and sense of humour felt like the first of its kind and you need another teenager to process it with you."
1326,"very good stuf 9/10
"
1327,This game is so boring by yourself. Just looting and shooting! At least with a friend it's much more fun and chaotic!
1328,"Played this game constantly as a kid and still do, would recommend the borderlands series to any and all fans of fps games"
1329,"A good open world rpg with some cringe worthy characters. Good fun for a while but tbh i found it kinda outstays its last. 
Probably spent more time comparing weapons than playing the actual game.

1334,"I haven't played in a while but I haven't stopped thinking about this game. The gameplay is both awesome and beautiful. It's pretty good by yourself but, like all games, it's more fun with other people. I would definitely play this again someday"
1335,I started playing this game a year or 2 before BL2 came out and havent stopped enjoying the series ever since. Worth the money if you want to see a game that was way ahead of its time.
1336,"Mostly played on Xbox but who cares, this game is fantastic. It is a shooter that loves to subvert expectations and isn't afraid to make fun of itself. The Zombie island DLC is the best but the other DLC's are worth it too! Get yourself a claptrap and loot your way through the planet of Pandora today!"

1353,really it good)
1354,87 bazillion guns
1355,"It's a good game, recommended."
1356,its a great game full of fun quests and a good story line. its one of my favorite games and i cant wait to play the rest of the series.
1357,"Before I get into details and all, I have played Borderlands series since 2010, the first one, borrowed the disc from a friend back in Xbox 360, the second & the prequel that I also played, but owned in Xbox 360, but never really get a chance to play it. Then, Handsome Collection was FREE on EGS, so I nab it and then, I nab this one when it is discounted.

Okay so uhh...so far, THE STORY OF BORDERLANDS, center around Lilith, Brick, Mordecai and Roland in a quest for treasure, while ending up opening a giant alien. Gameplay is pretty basic shooter-looter RPG, in which an era that Gearbox is creating. The game is also pretty fun. By owning the Handsome Collection on EGS, I manage to learn the fun and story/lore of Borderlands, from the game narrative first, focusing on the Bandits and the Vault, then the second game with Megacorporation and the Siren origin, and THE-PRESEQUEL that fill the gap.

Anyways, cons are big, but not that big. For example, the use of Compass HUD is really f@#k!ng bad and thank god now that Gearbox changed the second game HUD with a minimap. I often get lost without looking at the bloody Map, I often get elsewhere that is not following direction of the quest, regardless. Also, the enemy spawn numbers is ridiculously infinite, as they won't stop coming after you and tear you down, but ended up fun. Though this ""feature"" should have been implemented on the second game, as Side-quest required them to kill as many f@#k!ng bandits/enemy to spawn, but for this game, I would say, absurdly hilarious!

So, is it good? Well, yes....sort of. Look, if you wanna know more about the lore of BORDERLANDS, I recommend to buy the first game and if you happened to catch the Second/Pre-Sequel/Handsome Collection either discounted or FREE in whatever platform you played, then you're at luck and the more you become a fan of the game. If you happened to feel the need to skip the game, but still want it for some reason, I recommend to wait for the game on DISCOUNTED PRICE.

In AMD-A12 9720p RADEON R7 / 12 COMPUTE CORES 4C+8G w/ 12GB RAM, the game is playable to 30fps to above. Not sure about the Enhanced though, but in another day, I might think of it. But for now, I will enjoy this game and the Handsome Collection for both collective, gameplay and narrative perspective.

8/10"
1358,Information collection is an exciting feature. Tedious and repetitive with a super convoluted and fast story line. Missions hold no weight to them but getting new guns can be pretty fun. Maybe if I had hopped on the borderlands bandwagon when it originally came it would be different. 7/10.
1359,4/10
1360,"The game that started it all, borderlands 2 is my favorite game of all time and this is a damn good game that started the whole franchise, there is a lot of world building and awesome characters to choose from each with there own abilities and started weapons and proficiencies. The cell shaded graphics make this game as timeless as its sequel, prequel and 3rd entry. The action RPG elements are super satisfyingly good and the online multiplayer scene although almost completely dead still somewhat exists. Its rare but you will eventually find some people to play with believe it or not. Its all about that never ending grind though and its like they say... There ain't no rest for the wicked. :^)"

Hell, borderlands runs wi' higher fps rate oan mah neep pc than l4d2 sae that's saying something. Ah think th' ainlie 2 aishans that come tae mynd ur that: 

1. Th' gam doesn't launch (general protection error) 'n' ye hae tae copy a file (cudart.dll), paste it in th' identical folder 'n' rename it (physxcudart_20.dll) tae solve it. 

2. If ye git motion sickness while playing half-life 2, ye'll likelie an' a' git it while playing borderlands. Bit it's a fixable issue. Fur me, disabling aim assist made an immediate difference.

Shoot and loot with your friends. Level your character with new skills to improve your killing capabilities. Robots, bandits and bad jokes all the way.

1401,"my absolute favorite of the Borderlands titles, and one of my very favorite games of all time. I put most of my hours in on the ps3, but god did I enjoy it.

This game, unlike it's descendants maintained a perfect balance of post apocalyptic ambiance, action, and amazing weapons. I don't know why this series evolved into a depository of memes, sjw pandering, and dubstep. but I'm not a fan of that direction it took. Borderlands 1 is a gem that sadly will never be replicated."

1405,"An old but great game. Its the most atmosphheric of all the borderlands games, but it lacks the replayability the others have in part by the somewhat lackluster character customization, and other outdated gameplay aspects. Recommended for a fun diversion for a playthrough or 3.
Do note however that some skills and classmods in this game features bugged abilities that either dont work at all or works contrary to how its supposed to. The only character without broken skills and classmods is siren. Brick has for example a skill that increases recoil instead of reducing it as stated."

1407,This shooter definitely changed it's genre for its time and probably it was one of the most unique and best.

1411,"just play the second one, i played for 10 hours that were boring as shit and then my save file died, with little to no variety in its level design and zero creativity to everything that isn't the visuals"
1412,Couldn't finish this one on here but did the remastered version on the ps4. I've played too much borderlands and gotten burned out of the series though honestly but I do suggest this. It's a good time. I'd suggest playing this with a buddy though. Tends to get boring alone unfortunately. That's basically my only con really. Better with someone.
1413,"[h1][b]SHORT REVIEW:[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*] Nice setting and map designs.
[*] Decent game-play.
[*] Average story.
[*] Good looking game for its time. Liked the cartoonish art-style.
[*] Easy to start. But bit hard as you progress and definitely quite a difficult to achieve 100% and time consuming too.
[/list]


[h1][b]LONG REVIEW:[/b][/h1]


[h1][b][u]Game-play[/u][/b][/h1]

This game is a grindfest. To the point that it felt unnecessary on some occasions.
There is a levelling system. You level-up by getting XPs. You get XPs by killing enemies and completing main as well as side missions. If you are at a low-level compare to your enemies then it becomes a difficult task to beat them and vice versa. So, it is advisable to level-up before attempting the given mission(s) (level requirement will be given in a mission description). Balancing this thing may become a issue during your journey


[h1][b][u]Enemies and weapons[/u][/b][/h1]

I liked facing various enemies and bosses in general.
Bosses are literally bullet-spongy to make them artificially difficult. If you die during boss fights you have to start the fight from the beginning. This makes boss-fights sometimes frustrating.
Some locations are spammed with same enemy types. You need to be patient to get through such sections.
You heavily rely on various weapons which you get by looting to progress in this game. But, RNG system is bit off here in my opinion. Most of the weapons are not that useful in the first place. So, your luck factor plays a good roll to get powerful weapons, shields and mods.


[h1][b][u]Campaign time[/u][/b][/h1]

Main campaign requires around 15-20 hours (depends on your FPS skills) to complete which is called playthrough 1.
After that you can continue with playthrough 2, which is the same campaign but starts with high level enemies.
There are 4 characters with various skill-sets to play with.
I played with one character for both the playthroughs (including DLCs) and one more character for Playthrough 1 main campaign (No DLCs). Played few missions with other two characters for achievement purpose.
You will get so much play-time (nearly 200 hours) if you want to level-up all the characters to max level. All the best, if you decide to do so.


[h1][b][u]DLCs[/u][/b][/h1]

There are 4 DLCs in this game which can be played in any order. According to me, 2 DLCs (THE ZOMBIE ISLAND and THE SECRET ARMORY) are good. One (CLAPTRAP’S NEW ROBOT REVOLUTION) is average, but I liked the claptrap as an NPC character and one last DLC (MAD MOXXI’S UNDERDOME RIOT) is ridiculous and plain stupid.
Underdome DLC is included in this game to troll the players IMHO, because achievements for this DLC are very painful, time wasting and luck-driven to get. Same goes for collector achievements in Claptrap DLC and Invincible boss battle for Secret Armory DLC.


[h1][b][u]Achievements[/u][/b][/h1]

You can play this game solo or co-op. Some co-op achievements are also included. So, it is good to look into the forum section(s) to get the help. Some achievements are fair and satisfying. But few achievements are quite boring and included to make your game-play unnecessarily longer.
My steam buddy ""Han"" helped me with co-op and Underdome achievements. So, big thanks to him.
So, if you are a achievement hunter then you are in for a long time.


[h1][b][u]Bugs[/u][/b][/h1]

I encountered few map related bugs and glitches, due to which I had to restart a couple of missions. Also, encountered one mission related glitch in Secret Armory DLC. So, I was unable to complete that during 2nd playthrough. It didn't bother me much since I was at max level and got 100% achievements already.


[h1][b][u]Verdict[/u][/b][/h1]

I got this game in a bundle called The Humble Endless RPG Lands Bundle for a dollar on Humble Bundle in 2017. I decided to start with this series last month. Plus, I also got enhanced edition for free like everyone else. Nice bonus. But I don't think I'll play it in the near future since I'm done with this game for now.

Overall, I enjoyed this game. So, it is definitely worth the price that I paid.
[b]My verdict: 8/10[/b]"
1414,A very classic single player looter shooter. Good story as well. Work well with friends.
1415,"I love this game,the most longest game i played so far in my library when i write this review."
1416,"It's a great game to play.
"
1417,
1418,Very fun and easy storyline to follow.
1419,"Old game. But a great game. Start here. Save a buck.
"
1420,"I remember who I blagged to buy this for me when I originally was under age.. back on the 360.. hated it.. since then, completed it on PC and love it! 

(Game was a gift... shoutout to my man Dora!)"
1421,"Pros:
+ a lot of guns with interesting 'traits'
+ can be funny if you get references
+ feels really nice if you get a good weapon and you fight enemies on your level
+ DLCs

cons:
- basically no story
- ending is extremly disappointing
- end boss loot is extremly disappointing
- feels unfair if you dont find good gun
- difficulty curve is very uneven. You can have no problems killing stuff, then you go to the next zone and you cant do anything because enemies crush you
- enemies feel like they are cheating, hitting you from a kilometers away from a shotgun, while you cant hit them back
- bad UI, checking map or quests forces you to stop and then to watch 'rearm' animation
- picking up items feels really bad after some time"
1422,Super fun to play with your friends.
1423,"gear box supports a racist hate group. dont support these people
"
1424,good mindless fps
1425,good
1426,I like shooter games like this one.
1427,yes
1428,8/10
1429,For the begginer it is intuitive and then for the experienced it is hard enough to make you work to beat the game.
1430,Just an endless grind of feeling under-powered against the same enemies again and again.
1431,"+ funny
+ different
+ pretty much what it promises, a dystopia fps with some role elements

- Enemy A.I.
- Combat and missions get repetive (I don't get this on FPS's, if you like grinding loot, then this is a + for you)
- Lots of moving back and forth, it's darn slow

Overall positive though. Not so good that I'd play this through with different class setups, atleast not without a buddy."
1432,It's better than the sequel.
1433,"Great game if you want to play the original as is. I recommend getting Borderlands GOTY Enhanced edition as it has 4K graphics, better FPS, and a lot of bugs/glitched fixed. Either way, enjoy as this is the start of one incredible franchise!

9/10 in my book."
1434,fun!!!
1435,yea
1436,"A great co-op game with friends! 9/10 

You can still play solo and level your character up."
1437,"This game has aged perfectly fine, isimpl love it and i am sure that you will love it as well"
1438,"I Know it says I've only played Borderlands for about 80 minutes but I've put over 1000 hours into this series and love it so much Borderlands 1 is an incredible game and if haven't bought it yet what the hell are you doing go buy it, its such an incredible original game with great story and characters wasn't bored for one minute."
1439,Great game! Hours of enjoyment!
1440,"still just as good, worth playing it before the second one"
1441,BORDERLANDS LOOT!!!!
1442,"Addictive, fast paced, and aging well for an older game.  Much better than the sequel"
1443,The earth is 4.6 billion years old and we managed to exist at the same time as this masterpiece.
1444,"Great first series FPS Game 
Look so badass but graphics had some little blurry"
1445,"Grind and Shoot, ez as dat"
1446,Looty tooty
1447,"I was born without this fear
Now only this seems clear
I need to move, I need to fight
I need to lose myself tonight

Woah come with me now
I'm gonna take you down
Woah come with me now
I'm gonna show you how."
1448,Currently better balanced than Borderlands 3.
1449,Classic of its genre. I Recommend.
1450,Even thou it's a little anoying to have to pick up everything manually its still a fun game.
1451,So big. So angry. So dead
1452,"Amazing game
I love it so much"
1453,good
1454,"A solid borderlands for being the first one. Not my favorite one out of all of them for sure, but still solid. Just don't pick Roland :)"
1455,"made by a company that thinks this is ok. 

Did my accent throw you off? I meant to say: ""I need y'all to help me fix up some inspirational posters, y'all. Donuts, cowboys, homophobia."
1456,"Classic, get it for limitless fun with friends."
1457,better than 3
1458,Fun game.

1488,prettyy cool
1489,enjoyable game
1490,"Great game, many play styles and great grind loop."
1491,"I will never support another Gearbox game after what happened to SupMatto. If you buy this game, you are supporting bullies."
1492,"Better than BL2, I can stay awake for this one <3"
1493,"People say, skip Borderlands and go right to the second part.
Excuse me but that is bull. 
Every important character in Borderlands is mentioned or has an appearance in BL2. BL1 is not as engaging but if you want the full experience you need to play it. Who skips the first part anyway. How barbaric.

Pro
- intense climax building
- many different weapons
- NPC characters
- interesting style

neutral
- music is nothing new but its okay

con
- climax building is for the second part
- often times I asked myself who the playable characters are and wished for more intel
- the challenges are too unreal (2.500 kills of a species that appears at the end)
- a little bit repetetive 

all in all its not the best game, but i still enjoyed it.


spoiler:


holy shit i was so angry and sad at the end. i asked myself if it was worth the game when they  revealed the vault. i was so angry i stopped playing for a coupe of weeks. But after i started the second part, It seemed that the studio used the payers disappointment and made a change. its like they were actually recieving the feedback and tried to give a reason for the events that happened. and it worked."
1494,great story. cool guns. good characters. 10/10 would recommend.
1495,"i love the creative, comic book style, and the story lines. the game play is pretty awesome too!"
1496,"game is good, order of borderlands games in steam library is out of order because of this game"
1497,it gud
1498,Still a great game
1499,"just buy it already, you wont regret it"
1500,I love the crazy characters and the unique art style.
1501,"No memes or jokes this time boys, this game's a classic from the past. A moment of silence and F in the chat for time, for she's a cruel ho."
1502,"Although I have not finished this game, I have thourougly enjoyed my time with it. Now, I do recomend on grinding so do be warned that if you are not the type to like grinding in games, you may not enjoy it as much. This game is also difficult."

1509,"First game of this genre I've ever played and it was awesome. I like the art, it makes us feel like they tried to put HQs characters in a 3D world. The humor behind chaos tho.
This is a great game to play with friends."
1510,It's better than Borderlands 3.
1511,Loot Shooter. Boring af.
1512,"that tin can, always in trouble :D"
1513,"yes
"
1514,"Yeah..... Just play it. Lots of people criticise this game for a lack of story. While the story is kind of lacking, basically you're on a planet called Pandora as a ""vault hunter"" looking for a supposed ancient vault filled with incredible treasures, the gameplay, ungodly amount of weapons and pure fun you have while playing more than make up for it."
1515,"Repetitive, same enemies over and over, not just types of enemy but also enemies you've already killed and completed quests on respawn. Not worth the time."
1516,cannot recommend this game enough. I owned this on xbox 360 and all in all I've probably beat the story 5-6 times.
1517,"I have played this game on several systems over the time it's been out, and never once has it disappointed!! It's fun, plays very well, is very immersive, and has near endless replay value. An absolute must-have in the collection of any FPS or RPG fan!"
1518,meh
1519,GOOD GAME
1520,"A great achievement/progression-based co-op game with levels, classes, and a skill tree.  Story and missions are interesting."
1521,It's a good game
1522,"Borderlands GOTY is a cel shaded loot based RPG/FPS with a mild comedy/post apocalypse theme.  Shoot hordes of enemies, loot crates to get weapons with different stats, grind the same missions endlessly to get better loot so you can live through boss fights.  The game features a healthy co-op mode as well.

On the technical merits, Borderlands GOTY is an excellent, well polished game with a full gamut of graphics customisation options.  The stylistic art is AAA tier.  

Here's the downside: Gearbox/2K have gone completely crazy with DLC for the game (the full game can cost hundreds, there's no justification, it's just greed and gouging).  Furthermore, even though this is ""GOTY"" and therefore should include everything, it doesn't!  This is superseded by the Borderlands GOTY Enhanced Edition.   So I can't recommend this even if the core game is decent enough.   Buy the GOTY Enhanced Edition instead (why is this superseded version even on the store??)."
1523,yes
1524,there are enemies that you can shoot and it's fun.
1525,"Short version: Its fun by your self and fantastic with your friends.

Longer version pioneering the looter shooter genre Borderlands does a good job blending the classic loot and levelling RPG mechanics of a classic Diablo game with a first person shooter. The story is mediocre and characters are interesting."
1526,yeah
1527,great game
1528,"Borderlands is an unique shooter. Alone or with friends, it will addict you. You'll always want to get better gear, better guns, and more guns, and you won't even notice time passing. For example, I didn't even notice I had 61 hours in this until I saw it."
1529,"Great art style for the game, and always fantastic humor."
1530,"I know this is a popular series, but I just can't get into it. I've only played a few hours but the game already feels extremely formulaic. The story is basically non-existent and every single mission feels like a generic MMO side quest. It's always ""kill this number of enemies"" or ""fetch this number of stuff"". I've heard that the game is more fun if you play with friends, but as a guy who prefers solid single player campaigns this game leaves you cold.
Don't get me wrong, Borderlands is technically not a bad game per se. It has a unique visual style and the combat works fine (although I do wish the guns felt like they had more impact). It's just that with such a minimal story you can't get invested in anything, especially boring fetch quests. I wouldn't mind the lack of story if the game threw something new my way at every turn like the Souls games, but it's just so predictable and uninteresting. If you want a good first person shooter the Far Cry series and Doom are a lot better in my opinion."
1531,fun game
1532,"OLD BUT GOLD
"
1533,"Not a bad game. I play it every day. You don't get very far without rigging it for God, but playing it doesn't require more study than a college degree like Diablo 3."
1534,"great and funny 
and the guns are awesome"
1535,"I like the art concept of the game, but don't think it actually made it look good. I say about this the same thing I said about borderlands 2;
""This was one of the lonliest feeling games I ever played. Even with other people it wasn't fun.

The way the loot, combat and upgrades work are all bad, imo. I didn't care about any of the story or people in the game.

Its not a bad game just because I don't like it, but I wouldn't even want it if I got it free (now that I know). I'm forgetting this series completely."""
1536,Old but gold
1537,AWESOME!
1538,"less buggy than the other version and nice to not feel tempted by the gold chest as well.

nothing else to say."
1539,"Shoot everything that moves, and then loot all their cool sh!t"
1540,"Still in 2020 the best borderlands game.
also the no blatant political bias"
1541,Lilith: The Siren! :)
1542,good
1543,Perfect game.  No choice of skill level to play.  Everyone is the same.  Fun and frustration all rolled into one.  Hours of enjoyment for me and I'm over 70 years old.
1544,all round great game
1545,War never changes.
1546,Good
1547,the long awaited sequel to borderlands
1548,"Play it PUSSY!

It's really fun and I think you'd like it"
1549,this shit bringin me back to my childhood my mans on gang you oughtta play this
1550,Grindy and boring.
1551,"This game is a great time. Don't listen to the hype around 2, 3 or the presequel. This is by far the best in the series."
1552,"I can't believe I never played this game way back when it was recommended to me (something like 10 years ago). The gameplay is amazing. It feels like you level up appropriately by playing through the missions, so there's no need to just grind skags to get more XP to be able to do other things."
1553,:D
1554,Still a good time playing co-op over LAN.
1555,THE BEST GAME EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
1556,very gud
1557,"Being the original game in the franchise, this game made me play the game, even if I already completed the game multiple times, the ability to farm the best possible items in the game makes Borderlands one of the best loot-and-shoot games out there."
1558,FUN!
1559,Too much grinding for my tastes.
1560,I play it with my buddies
1561,Love it to the day of writing this review. Whether you revisit it or you're playing through it for the first time it's fun and challenging to level up and finish the game 100%. All the later versions (including the GOTY Remaster/Enhanced) work on and improve anything that you might not enjoy about this one. One of the best series out there.
1562,I found an alien gun in a skag pile.
1563,Very fun rpg shooter grafics are low but it is also an older game it runs very smooth for 90% of computers and even most laptops
1564,yes.
1565,"What do you want. Its Borderlands, Guns, Crazy characters, RPG FPS goodness. Its a well made game with hours of content. On sale, or full price, its a great game."
1566,.
1567,PIZZ OV
1568,has claptrap i iz play
1569,nostalgia when i used to play this game on onlive everyday when i was a kid ;)
1570,A classic
1571,"It's a very good game for when it came out and how old it is. I highly recommend getting it if you haven't, but not so much the DLCs especially not the zombie DLC as it is garbage all around."
1572,"Now, this is from the perspective of someone who mostly played solo, but I did not have much fun with this game. It's clear that the (pre) sequels fixed many of my issues with the formula, so there's not much reason to go into much detail. Besides, if you're interested, the Enhanced edition exists, so just grab that version."
1573,is good yes
1574,"Loved this game on the xbox, love it on pc. I use a controller most of the time, but K&M work perfectly too."
1575,"its more borderlands fun
must play"
1576,"A work of genius. Slapstick violence on a massive map with oddball characters and a quirky storyline. You can buy and sell weapons, pick and choose missions and rule the Borderlands. There's even Zombie DLC. If I'm being picky some of the missions can get a bit samey but if you're looking for value for money I've played 158 hours on this SO FAR and I'm still hoovering up side-missions I missed the first time around."
1577,"Entertaining enough to get through it but I wouldn't recommend for a single player experience, really feels like this game was made for co-op. I don't have any friends who play the game so I can't really judge the co-op but the game is overall okay but feels really empty and pointless. This game is certainly cool in many ways but not enough to justify the singleplayer experience"
1578,Really good even after a few years. The art style holds up and the game-play is good and if you just got into borderlands I suggest you buy this game or the handsome collection!
1579,"Amazing game, its a shame the enhanced edition doesn't work!"
1580,"6hour to full, too ez"
1581,"It is a fun game, think of something like Fallout without being an RPG. It has its own take on RPG elements and the game has its own merits as a sandbox-ish exploration / shooter. On the paper it should engage me much more than it did. Don't get me wrong it is a good game, I liked it and its weird MadMax-ish wasteland. I'm just more of an RPG guy."
1582,"how


"
1583,boring like fallout
1584,A true classic looter shooter that lives in our hearts for the rest of time
1585,This shit boring as hell. What the actual fuck. I just shot an infinite amount of SKAGS for 2 hours. Not badass at all. Apparently 2 is more badass and fun but I a ran out of will power after the badassery of this one.
1586,I just bought Borderlands 2 and 3. The franchise is so solid.
1587,much better loot system in my opinion than in bl2 and bl3
1588,dANK
1589,Still a great borderlands game even after 11 years
1590,I love it!!!!!!!
1591,Fun with old-school gearbox.
1592,I love this game played a lot of hours on my pc and ps3. i rembered when i came out on the ps3 and i fliped when i played it
1593,"BL1 is the first game in the Franchise and was developed by Gearbox and was released in 2009 for PC, Xbox360 and the PS3. You choose one of Four Vault Hunters who are pretty much people just trying to gain themselves fame and fortune as they race to Discover The Vault which is Rumoured to contain Treasure, Unseen artefacts and so forth. The Game can be played with 4 players or you can play alone. The Story is pretty forgettable though and isn't interesting at all but that wasn't really the point. BL1 claimed to have Millions of Guns to use as you level up your Characters by completing The Main Story or by doing Side Quests. The Higher Levels you obtain the more Abilities you unlock and can use essentially. 

This doesn't come without its costs either, Enemies will obviously become Stronger and you will face Tougher varients but the Guns become a lot more Powerful, they fire faster, they deal more damage, they may have 250 rounds per magazine, they can set enemies on fire etc. Dependent on your Character and the Abilities you chose you'd want to obtain guns and modifications that suit you and your play style, really the Freedom is up to you and its good for the most part. 

Guns come in Five Rarities in BL1; You Got Commons, Uncommons, Rares, Epics and Legendaries, one thing i do like is how even higher rarity weapons aren't always better than a Common Gun. Sure that Rare Shotgun may deal Fire Damage but it may also have only 2 shots wheres your Common Shotgun has 12 and a Bayonet for better melee damage. Combat in this game is simple enough, you can aim down sights, throw grenades, Melee etc and Sprint. Enemies have basic artificial intelligence and all perform differently, Psycho's will just want to get as close as possible to tear you apart (Or try to Anyways). Skags attack in Packs and their Strengths are in Numbers and Marauders and Bandits just try to stay at range and behind cover. 

They do avoid Grenades as well and can at times keep you on your toes which is a good thing, the real difference with Enemies are of Course Bosses. Bosses all share Similarities like having High Health, heaps of disposable minions they chuck at you but also have their own Unique attacks and their own Special Weapons which they drop upon death. A Majority of Bosses are Mandatory whereas some are not, you can revisit areas after you've killed them AND turned in the Quest to kill them again to either grind XP or try to get some of their Rarer Items. 

BL1 has a very slow start though but eventually picks up once you get to leave the Starting area and i got to say i haven't been more glad to leave that horrible piece of S**t starting area and to never go back, combat and enemies are a lot more interesting and fun to fight and you can finally get your hands on some good weapons. Sadly however the Quests for this game are very similar and just boring. Find gun parts, retrieve Audio Logs, Kill someone or somethings and thats pretty much it. There aren't any interesting standout Missions until mabye the final boss. The Game can be Short or quite long depending on if you did Side Quests or not. Personally i lost interest quite quickly and just urged to finish the whole thing. i haven't played as the other Vault Hunters and i probably never will unless i played with Friends which would be a lot more enjoyable. Traversing Pandora to discover The Vault was a mostly uninteresting experience and i found the Environments and Locations to be so damn dull. This is one of *Those* early Mid 2000's games where everything looks Gray, Brown and with little to no colours outside of the Grays and Browns. Games from that Era may not be bad but i will say thank goodness the Gray and Browns were phased out. As for Reference i beat this on Console and this is my 2nd time playing it techically, i haven't finished for my 2nd time though and found little motivation to do so.

As a whole BL1 just left me unsatisfied and i didn't feel like replaying the Game. Its not terrible though and i had some genuine fun at TIMES but i see this as the weakest entry in the Franchise. If you like the Borderlands Franchise then you would probably like BL1 if you for some reason haven't touched it. It gets a B- a 7/10 and i reckon get some Mates or grab this on Sale."
1594, love the game
1595,It is pretty fun.
1596,I might not have played this as much as the other borderlands games but the game feels kinda empty but that's not to say its not fun because the combat is great and really punchy especially all the Jakobs guns they all feel great except the smgs because they suck.
1597,Origins of a legendary title!
1598,"Great shooting, and looting. Not easy to follow the story, lacking some points there."
1599,nice
1600,yes sir
1601,:)
1602,great game
1603,"10/10
just the best borderlands game in the series 
/ enough said"
1604,Its a great game. Just don't explore too much when you are low level unless you have a death wish.
1605,"A far better option than the ""enhanced"" version considering ti actually work. 

It is a really great game to play with friends and is still enjoyable to come back to even after playing through all of the later games in the series. 

It is a huge shame this is not included in the collection bundle as it means anyone lumbered with the mess that is the enhanced edition has to buy this again."
1606,Awesome fps with nice story.
1607,Borderlands is such an amazing game! The adrenaline and the excitement that you get when you kill a bandit or like me today killing The Sledge was such an amazing feeling.
1608,"Good game, but I swear if I have to hear ""Come on everybody check me out, I'm dancin', I'm dancin'!"" one more time I might just explode."
1609,it deleted my data and i'm very sad
1610,play this first BL2 then BL3 worth it!
1611,"Great game, but play the Enhanced Edition instead."
1612,"the very best of the borderlands series, co-op is LEGENDARY!"
1613,Good nastalgia trip

1615,Vey Fun coop first person shooter.
1616,mad max the game
1617,"Classic, always great to play. If you're new to it or picking it up again."
1618,A CLASSIC. It was game of the year. Enough Said.
1619,"Is Borderlands 2 better?
Ayep.
Does that mean Borderlands 1 is completely useless and not worth playing?
Nope."
1620,"My wife is new to the series and watching her play got me into the first game again. Despite the improvements made the later games in the series, the original remains a classic. Great balance between a casual and hardcore experience."
1621,Grrrrrrrr8
1622,"First Thing I Should Say, If You Buy Borderlands GOTY Play The Enhanced Edition. It's Just Better. If You Care About The Story Start Here. If You Don't (Like Me) Just Get The Handsome Bundle First. There's Not As Much Humor In The First One Either, But It's Still A Great Game. All In All, Buy Borderlands GOTY And Play The Enhanced, Or Just Don't Buy It Yet, And Get The Handsome Collection. Thanks For Reading!"
1623,meh
1624,"very good
"
1625,My favorite game of all time. If i could add up all the man hours i've put into this game across all platforms id probably have over 3000
1626,.
1627,sick
1628,It's just a great game all around
1629,texas sim
1630,"Simply put, it's never not been a fun game. About to play it again on another new computer, but I honestly love playing it again and again. Great Game!"
1631,"I find that the incredible different types of weapons availability and the myriad different enemies makes for high replay value.  The menu controls seem a little clunky, especially compared to Borderlands 2, but tolerable.  Very enjoyable"
1632,"This game is truly like no other and I would totally recommend this game to anyone who likes First-Person Shooter, Open-World, RPG."
1633,good
1634,Very fun shooter; fun to play by yourself or with friends. I love how I can replay my characters multiple times and still keep my weapons while facing more difficult opponents. This game does a great job at stopping weapon hoarders (I'm one myself) but one of the dlc's gives you the option to store a little bit of equipment if needed.
1635,full of action and killing.
1636,"even though this game is 10 years old . Its so fun to play 
if you wanna enjoy your time play this game"
1637,"this is a classic RPG with guns and crazy people, so like its america during the COVID - 19 crisis. On a less jokey point, its well built, story is great, controls are great, and for the hell of it im using a XBOX one controller because why not. However the controls for keyboard and mouse are good. 

It is a great game, made by a great DEV team. Buy it."
1638,Not as good as the 2nd but still a very nice game with low pc requirments
1639,"After playing the game on xbox and getting to again on pc gave me an old nostalgic feeling, still as fun as when i first played it way back"
1640,superb fun
1641,"This is just my opinion, but I did not think this series is that great. I gave it a chance, but it just does nothing for me. i found the humor to be boring and the game play to be boring as well. The story took too long for me to care.

If I have to play with other people in order to get a better experience, then the game has failed to me."
1642,good game
1643,Its gud
1644,:thumbsup:
1645,best loot and shooter played it 6 years stright on ps3 now i gt it on pc
1646,it's ok i guess
1647,"Fun stuff. Ages well, and while on the gruesome side, its quite funny!"
1648,"Very fun game - humorous characters, fun quests - absolutely love it"
1649,"You can play this game in many different ways despite there only being 4 characters, because each one of the you can build in different ways to fit your play-style better. There are also thousands of different guns, and many different enemies meaning that every play-through is not going to be identical and get stale because of that,
On a side note It is always fun to shoot a bandit that is several levels weaker than you in the head and see a fountain of meaty chunks."
1650,Very funny. more enjoyable if you really like the universe
1651,i feel in love with borderlands for the first time because i really live this graphics style and great story for that rpg game
1652,Yes!
1653,back in the day this was the shit and still holds up.
1654,It is just as addicting as BL2.
1655,"the game takes place in a wide open imaginary world, but it is not boring because there are probably unlimited kinds of weapons, many skins an areas. it is FPS game and you don't have to be a good shooter to play it, in other words it is a great casual game, throughout the game you will be always collecting things. you can carry tens of weapons while you can equip 4 only. you can also store special legendary items in banks. there is a wide range of enemies and creatures, also it is not always daytime, there is day and night. that thing is missing from almost all open world games. throughout the game you will be doing missions given by people to earn things. sometimes you have to choose the side you are going to give him a favor rather than the other side. the game map is divided to many areas that you can travel between them one by one or by fast traveling to any area no matter how far it is in seconds. each area has a unique environment, creatures and enemies.

game graphics has been updated recently so this old game still worth playing it, the only bad side of it is: it will kill your time!, play it only if you don't appreciate your time.

Edit: accuracy in this game is very poor, but that is a normal thing since this game is meant to be on different platforms."
1656,Awesome !!! :DDD
1657,"yes
"
1658,"Really fun, especially playing it with someone else! :)"
1659,"Borderlands 1 perfected the shooter looter formula and it did very well.
Not a fan of the story telling, but the gameplay is just nonstop fun (WITH FRIENDS). I would never play this alone. 
The update improved the old HUD and menu version of the game, which is appreciated.

8/10"
1660,Worth it
1661,fun gunplay and all brands have all weapon types
1662,"Loved this game since 2009, in all of it's small color pallet, enemy wall clipping, silly car physics, bad skill tree, disappointing final boss glory. 9/10, 10/10 with rice. Go play it, with me specifically if possible."
1663,Really fun but not as good as borderlands do would recomend if on sale.
1664,"hat undeniable impulse that pokes at the pleasure centers of the brain when you're looking at that sleek and impossibly flat television at the front of the electronics store. How much better and brighter would life be if only you could bring it home? You consider what's in your wallet, what kind of space rests between credit balance and limit, maybe for a second what your family might think, and perhaps more importantly how jealous your friends would be. It's what drives economies that thrive on consumerism, and that urge to snatch up glittering new toys is what keeps the action energized in Gearbox's Borderlands, a first-person shooter title that caters to the thief, hero, and adventurer lurking in all of us.

For the uninitiated, this is a loot hunting game like Blizzard's Diablo. The action begins and you're flung out into an open world with a handful of quests and legions of baddies who'll do whatever they can to prevent you from killing their leaders, wiping out an arbitrary number of their compatriots, opening drain valves in their hideouts, snatching up important artifacts and documents, or collecting a large number of shiny objects. There's a tale of a secret vault and advanced technology and a snowy image of a female face that pops onscreen when important things are about to happen, nudging you forward and providing additional narrative context, but this isn't a choice and consequence game with morality systems and labyrinthine quest strings. It's the loot that's the real motivator here.
"
1665,"Though not as good as Borderlands 2  it's still a great game, I would say this is my second favourite borderlands game after 2."
1666,Very fun classic game.  Still worth the money if you want a good game to sit down and play for a while!
1667,"I've just gotten back into gaming and started with the Fallout 3 and NV games.  I then jumped into Borderlands because many people recommended it since I liked Fallout games.  It doesn't disappoint.  It's actually a nice brain break from the Fallout series.  Where in Fallout there's a storyline and character development to manage (not to mention a LOT of inventory) this game is pretty simple in those terms and it's just good to follow along with some missions, shoot up things with a variation of weapons and have a great time, without having to think too much.  Think of it like working it.  Fallout is a good pump in the gym and Borderlands is like a nice relaxing jog."
1668,hi
1669,"Love love love this game. Great loot, fun first person shooter. Boss battle at the end was fantastic. Love the DLC. Totally worth it!"
1670,A really good game to play coop.
1671,"This is the first entry into the : Borderlands, and it gets down elements that you would not even see in most modern shooters. your meant to experience the game evolve in story and discover locations."
1672,"good game 
"
1673,"This game is good. It´s an fps mixed with an RPG. That along with the humor makes this game great. The post apocalyptic setting and shooter elements remind me of the Fallout games, but this game is a more action-based and has a better loot system than Fallout. In this game, it took me about five seconds to realize how the mechanics worked, i.e the controls and the loot system. However, when I played a Fallout game for the first time, I was confused by all the stats. It took me an hour to figure out how to use VATS.

The story of this game is not the main focus. The abundance of side missions and the massive arsenal of weapons make this game very fast-paced and rewarding. the maps are filled to the brim with things to do and see. The enemies have levels, which is a great way to keep new players from grinding out the levels they need to face those enemies, it gives them a goal to work up to.

I only have one problem with this game. The arsenal is TOO great. Certain weapons are going to shred through enemies while others will just barely scratch them. If I would rate this game, I would give it a 9.5/10."
1674,This game is pretty good. My main complaint is that it keeps uninstalling every time i finish playing it and I kinda gave up on trying to install it again lmao
1675,bad
1676,absolutely fantastic game
1677,"Good game, would play with others if I had good specs"
1678,"Borderlands was something I always looked forward to after school. I replayed this game so many times in middle school, and I'm sure I'll repeat that now. Should have bought this years ago. Buy it, promise you won't regret it. My only gripes are that the shotguns weren't all that fun to use in this game, they feel weird, and it's easy to get stuck/get your vehicle stuck. Other than that, solid 10/10, fun open world, entertaining characters and lots to do."
1679,"PLAY WITH FRIENDS
"
1680,"I mean it's alright... BUT overrated As F**k
 
 For me and my friend the story is just too bland nothing is happening and the end was kinda dissapointing/"
1681,it's good
1682,"Fun for people who love comedy, RPG games, and first person shooters."
1683,Its really weird reviewing this game in 2020 because everyone and their mother have played this game. To summarize its a game you can buy for cheap and play for hours with friends and get loads of fun. But if you are buying in 2020 rather go for the third one.
1684,Better than Borderlands 3.
1685,Is that you Kiryu-Chan?!
1686,Best game ever made. Better than Borderlands 2 and the Presequel.
1687,nice game
1688,It's fun.
1689,Amazing Looter Shooter this is one of the best ever.
1690,Great fun. I'm returning after beating it a few years back. All I can say is weird and fun.
1691,One of my favorite Diablo clones of all time
1692,"I love it way too much



it's yes"
1693,kinda sucks cock
1694,"I like the exploding things. 
"
1695,"good
"
1696,Its Borderlands what else more can i say?
1697,This game is alot of fun to play both alone and with friend
1698,"Fun game, mad hatter shooter with roleplaying game elements of character improvement - but nothing but flash, bang and boom. Scratches the itch for mayhem and guns, lots of guns...big guns. Also, different play styles for different chosen characters make for replay value... though likely it really does best to allow variety in co-operative play, where you can have an ""adventuring party"" of bad arse gunbuddies!
"
1699,"Its a classic, I'm glad I finally played through the main story line."
1700,pretty good
1701,"Very good game!
"
1702,"Maybe this game was great at release, but years later, it doesn't hold up. The world is brown and empty. The final boss fight is amusingly easy. The jokes are ok, but not for me. And the limited inventory is just frustrating."
1703,so much fun brings back so many memories
1704,"It's a fun blast from the past.  This is where the Borderlands franchise started.  However, if you started playing the series with Borderlands 2, there are some  quality of life changes you will be missing (auto-loot for cash).   The game is still a fun looter/shooter.

I originally played this game on the PS3 and completed the main game and Zombie Island of Dr. Ned  only when it was released in 2009.  This time, I am finally working through the rest of the  DLC once I complete the main quest.."
1705,"yes ver good
"
1706,Fun mayhem on Pandora! Smooth shooter. Game doesn't try to take it all too seriously. Love the graphics.
1707,-
1708,lag game
1709,"the game is good, Randy Pitchford is not"
1710," Classic Borderlands, Can't go wrong."
1711,"This is a polarizing game.  I've played it 100 hours, so you know it can't be all bad, but here's my summary:

This game is not a shooter.  It's an arrow comparison engine where you examine your randomly generated gun against ten million billion other randomly generated guns to see if you can find 2% more damage or some malarky.  It's not bad, but the guns lack any feeling of power or heft, and you end up just slogging through a million empty environments shooting the same couple of dudes in the face with guns that might as well be copy pastes of each other.

Its sin is being repetitive, and if you have friends to play with or podcasts to listen to or literally anything more interesting than playing this game, you'll enjoy the backdrop of violence and looting.  As a single-player experience, it's basically all the grinding and non-story of an MMO, but with no one else around.

It is genuinely funny in places, and Claptrap singlehandedly kept me playing at times.  It's also worth a shout that the General Knoxx DLC is amazing and really does a lot to spice things up in a more focused environment.

I wish I could give this a neutral, but ultimately I got Borderlands-ed out so bad that I'm just done."
1712,yes
1713,Played this game as a kid and never got off it
1714,greta game and story
1715,"Borderlands is a awesome game, keeps you busy for a long time, story line is captivating and never leaves you wanting more."
1716,6/10 it's worth eventually playing if you don't mind grindy rpgs
1717,"(I'm just going to put my Borderlands 2 review here, since they're so similar.) Borderlands is a cool first-person shooter. The weapons you'll find have different stats or abilities. I think I saw or heard someone describe it as kind of like a Diablo loot system. This game looks cool, too. I haven't played multiplayer, so I can't speak on that part of it. I've only played through it once. It is a popular game and I don't think it's a bad one."
1718,"A cool, level up shooter."
1719,"Catch-A-Ride!

Also, General Knoxx <3"
1720,"This game has awesome graphics, and excellent storyline, half a zillion DLC side missions, and enough customizability to replay over and over again."
1721,   This 1st person shooter is fun and requires you to think strategy .This game is so addictive the characters and graphics are amazing! This is a great shooter! Go play it I'm sure you'd like it who wouldn't ?!?
1722,uh-oh claptrap is  telling you about a bounty board again
1723,"it's alright, runs better than BL2 atleast"
1724,dont play the enhanced version you wont be able to solo farm the craw monster whatever his name is sorry
1725,"It's an extremely fun game to play, my brother got me into it and I've since gotten my friends into it as well!"
1726,Love this series
1727,"So far so good!! I purchased Borderlands 2 in 2014 and I loved every detail of the game. Of course, Borderlands being the first game of the saga, it has low graphics in some areas of the game, but other than that I love the game. The main story of the base game gives you many opportunities to level up at an early stage of the game, that and also the possibility to explore the whole level and discover compartments of money and stuff, action that really makes you observe the area and the details. Love their comic-like graphic (very personal to me). I still haven´t played online, but with 4 friends in the same LAN network it´s an enjoyable experience as well (I don´t like it that much cuz of the screen splitting, but nothing more than that).
Great game, great franchise. 100% recommended by this common user. I really hope you enjoy it!!"

1729,"The best loot, rpg, fps..."
1730,one of my favorites
1731,Its cool I guess
1732,"This game brought me love for the FPS genre. It's funny, has great sense of humor, fancy graphics, it pushes your interest to explore and gain loot. Well applied RPG elements. My favorite in the series. One of the greatest games of the century. Totally recommend.

UPDATE: My other recommendation: GET A MALIWAN !!!"
1733,its good but aged
1734,"Still a classic
"
1735,Doesn't Suck.
1736,GREAT GAME
1737,"if you have a uw monitor I would not advised you to try, no matter what I tried its a cancer"
1738,Best Game Ever!
1739,"The Borderlands series is one of my all-time favorite in gaming. This is the game that started it all. Let's get into details.

With its appealing cartoon-style visuals, cheesy humor and loads upon loads of gun porn, Borderlands is an extremely fun game to play. It is one of those games, which are designed to be played in COOP with friends. Its matching system is completely usable and easy to get your hands on even by today's standards.

The game tells a half-decent story about vault hunters on a hostile planet called Pandora, where every living thing is dreaming of killing you and drinking from your skull. The characters are colorful and charismatic, from the mini-bosses to the robot Claptrap, gunsmith Marcus, mechanic Scooter, doctor Zed, bar host Moxxi & others.

In terms of gameplay, Borderlands is fast-paced, violent and very chaotic. The enemy AI is aggressive and relentless and the game gets much harder towards the end and new game plus playthroughs as the bad guys scale-up and put out enormous damage to the player. There are four playable characters with three branches to invest points into skills. It is balanced in a way, that is virtually impossible to max out all three branches in a single playthrough for one character, so you're looking at at least two full playthroughs for one character to get the most of his / her skills & abilities. This adds to the game's impressive replayability and makes it fun even after you beat it multiple times. On top of all this, the game has several story DLCs to add to your experience, which makes it an even better value for money.

Highly recommended!"

1741,Pretty good
1742,"Let me start out by saying that I do not like shooters. 1st person, 3rd person, or whatever. I have never liked shooters. My son came to visit and brought his Xbox 360 and he said he had a game that if I would give it a chance, he was sure I would like it at least enough to play with him when he came to visit. When he loaded up Borderlands, my first reaction was ""Oh God! A Shooter."" I reminded him that I didn't like this kind of game at all. He talked me into trying. He suggested that I play Mordecai. To make a long story short, within an hour I was so hooked I lost all track of time. Between the pop culture knods and puns from my era (the story writers have GOT to be close to my age... which we won't mention what is) and the shere enjoyment of the game itself, it felt like we had only played an hour or so and I looked at the clock and it was 7 hours later! I went on to play the 2nd AND the presequel! I am still not very big on shooters, but I am at least a little more open to them because of this game and my son's persistance. Borderlands have you laughing hard one second and then wondering ""what the heck!?"" the next. The story is extremely engrossing, and the characters very relatable in their actions and motivations. When you get to the end (is there actually and end??) You will feel like you have acomplished the unachievable. If you are even looking at this game and wondering, I have only two words: ""BUY IT!"" Whatever genre is your preference, you will fall in love with it!"
1743,"Oldie but a goodie, it's dated for sure, but still a great game!  Lots of great dlc and just loads of fun to be had for all!"
1744,Superior Borderlands 1 bundle.
1745,"Lots of fun, the dialogue is entertainingly facetious. The stylized graphics are a nice touch.

So far, a fun take on a shooter with RPG elements."
1746,Do you want us to like borderlands? Beacuse this is how you will make us like borderlands!
1747,Game worth one hundred percenting.
1748,very nice stolen artstyle. the fact they kicked the artist out without paying for it always warms my heart
1749,This is a game.
1750,"This is perhaps the best game of all time. The shooting percentage is actually correct, the guns are good and the game is actually somewhat of a challenge. Best. Game. Ever."
1751,GREAT GAME FOR BEGINERS
1752,"What more can I say that hasn't already been said about this game? It might a bit... dated now. BUT, it's still loads of fun to play! So, grab some friends and kick back!"
1753,It has a good story and is worth its price.
1754,Easy mode is called Lilith.
1755,"You can stand on top of a burning pile of tires and slowly kill yourself. That's pretty lit, bro. 10/10!"
1756,"Very fun, but man are there so many side quests"
1757,"game is really fun, really liked that the game looks like a comic,"
1758,"This game is Fun and addictive
"
1759,"The comedy is still there, and the extra content is well worth getting in the GotY edition."
1760,"A classic, and for good reason. I come back to Borderlands and the charms of sunny Firestone again and again. Come for the local color and hospitality, stay for the Skag Dogs! (The famous Bladeflower Stew comes highly recommended, too.) Maybe not the best place to raise the kids, but no doubt, I great place to retire!"
1761,Lots of fun!!!
1762,"After 11 years this game is awesome,if you like rpgs loot thing+Fps this is your game.
9/10 (one point down just for the stupid Underdome and that big crazy MF crab).
PD:I'll get all the achievements,if you need help for unlock them,just let me know."
1763,"The senseless grinding is annoying and tedious. I know it's Borderlands, but I wanted to do something other than ""shoot bad guy, get loot"". Overall, this game has aged incredibly poorly."
1764,why would you not buy this game
1765,best way to get a game that's a shooter and Role Playing all wrap in one.
1766,it gud
1767,great game!
1768,Amazing game that makes you feel like a badass
1769,In this game you get to kill almost everything you see. Loads of fun.
1770,"Challenged one of my mates to a duel and instantly demolished him with my missile launcher. 10/10 power trip

Edit: All right, I've finished Playthrough 1 (but not yet 2), and it felt appropriate to update this review.

First of all, this is a great game with plenty of emphasis on co-op, from duels and arenas to class mods, two-seat runners, a medic skillset (rendered mostly useless in solo play) and even dialogue (when referred to in the third person, characters use ""they/them"" when referring to the Vault Hunters, which is a nice touch because it affirms that canonically, they didn't go hunting alone). It's very much playable alone, but it would be a shame to not experience the game the way the developers intended.

Its comic-y art-style is an immediate distinction from other games, and it helps add to the already somewhat-ludicrous setting of treasure-hunting mercenaries running around a barren planet. Right from the opening cinematic's song, Ain't No Rest For The Wicked, it sets the tone of the game, just a bunch of antiheroes doing things that wouldn't always be considered morally good while in pursuit of a reward. (At one point in the story, you need to help a guy dressed in bandit attire stage a coup to be allowed access to your objective [spoiler]and it's fairly obvious how that turns out[/spoiler].)

The story's simple enough, it doesn't get the player-characters involved much, being off-worlders just doing jobs for pay while searching for the Vault. Half the exposition comes in the form of unvoiced text that you could entirely skip reading by hammering the Enter key whenever it pops up on your screen. Exposition on the Vault initially arrives in the form of audio logs by a researcher contracted by one of the many corporations on Pandora, who you eventually get to meet once you make it out of the starting area, and who also contracts you to work on finding and opening the Vault. Along the way, you end up butting heads with 2 factions, the bandits and the Crimson Lance, neither of whom particularly care about safeguarding the citizens' wellbeing any more than you do, but both of whom fail to appreciate you upsetting the status quo, and assault you whenever you cross paths. That's the long and short of it, but I enjoyed the details put into making the world feel alive (even if it had a nihilistic feel to it at times), like a guy bemoaning the wild plants ruining his shack, or somebody requesting your help recovering his porn magazines, or the plentiful bounty board missions.

The RPG-lite elements are great, as they rarely impede gameplay and only enhance it, like class mod bonuses adding skill points and team damage/health/ammo regen/skill regen/fire rate/anything else I missed. You do need to pay attention to your gear though, and constantly juggle out weaker gear lest you be oneshotted by enemies.

CW; the game has a lot of dark humour but is sometimes just dark. One of the blue Claptraps you rescue admits to having been raped by the soldiers that damaged it, and even says, ""Oh, yes, these are desperate men"", and expresses resentment at having been fixed and returning to such an experience. Claptraps are very sad to interact with, too, as most you meet will be initially damaged, and even seem to be designed to experience trauma for some reason, as one white Claptrap you will meet even suffers from PTSD.

Tl;dr: Great game, play with friends for best experience, most fun."
1771,"this game is awsome, i really recomend it"
1772,"Just an amazing game overall
Good looting and shooting,
Good story,
good replay-ability with friends"
1773,Diablo FPS
1774,"Horse Armor DLC for Oblivion, Master piece in the history of DLCs, compared to Mad Moxxis Underdome Riot. Propably the worst DLC in the history of DLCs. 85 Rounds with 5 waves each of the same bullshit over and 
over again for hours and hours.. 

Next is the Secret Armory of General Knoxx DLC. Another prime example of how not to design game. The DLC is vehicle themed, yet you constantly get roadblocks so that make you run on foot long distances when the running speed is way too slow compared to map size. Also on fast travel on any DLCs, this brings to me to my most important part of this review. The criminal farming level of use of one of deadly sins of gaming. Backtracking and artificial ways of making the game longer. If you do this shit you should never make any games at all ever again. Seriously what the fuck is wrong with you? 
 
Also the game is prime showcase of ""Consolitas"" disease. Not recommended at all."
1775,This game never gets old. Always fun.
1776,It's dope
1777,"The best Borderlands game hands down, it is unique, interesting quirky and relatively bug free. I remember my jaw dropping when I played it on my old PC, a long time ago. 

Wouldn't touch 3 or subsequent releases. The 2nd instalment was decent, but this original title should be enjoyed for what it is, and Gearbox should move on to something new and less s*it."
1778,Good Game!
1779,better than 3
1780,It's Borderlands ... enough said :D
1781,"Amazing game. Shows its age when you play it, for sure. But after about 30 mins of playing you get used to it. Hard to get into a new playthrough again, but after you've gotten some fun guns the game is very fun to play"
1782,9.3/10
1783,"This is, hands down, the godfather of the modern looter shooter. It defined what it was to be a 4 player co-op shooter. The character building and loot are fun and rewarding through the entire story and to the max level you can reach. The story isn't anything too impressive but the dark and morbid tone and the characters are enjoyable enough to carry the game the whole time. Given that there are two sequels out on steam, this is an older game and much less optimized than the other ones. Play this if you want more context for the events that happen in the other games but they do a good enough job of leading the player into the world so it's not necessary to enjoy them."
1784,"Violence, crude humor, and guns... its all you really need."
1785,When I played this game for the first time i thought that it was boring but i gave it another try and this game is great. not in my top 10 but it's cool
1786,I good first game of an amazing series.
1787,"One of my all time favourite franchises.  Not as polished as Borderlands 2, but great fun

1788,"An older game, but holds up extremely well. Still enjoyable, still playable. :)"

1801,yes.
1802,this game is awesome and im addicted
1803,Good.
1804,"This was a great game in 2009. However in 2020 the game and it's mechanics are now super outdated. Quests do not auto resolve (you have to run to the quest giver and manually turn it in) and you spend too much of your time running from one quest giver to another to pick up quests. 

Compared to the next two titles Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel, the quests and enemies are super repetitive and bland.

The only reason to play in 2020 is the story, and even then, just go watch it on youtube instead of spending hours running around killing the same mobs."
1805,"Sarcastic humor, violence, tons of guns.. Hard to not fall in love with this game. When i first bought it i was unable to play it, due to a low end graphics card. When i was finally able to run it, i was overjoyed and found this game to be very re-playable. My only regret was not playing it when it first came out, i would have had a blast playing it with friends."
1806,Optimization of this game for later hardware or software isn't good enough and this game always use integrated graphics card although I have set to dedicated GPU.
1807,"This was the first game ever that made me stay up till 4:00 in the morning, I highly recommend it."
1808,its a game i guess
1809,Very fun game.. I have played this a lot. :)
1810,"One of my favorite games out of this series. I have played this game on all platform's it cam out for. there is just some much to do, lots of weapons, just the hole feel and style of the game is amazing. Borderlands is one out of a hand full of games where i leave the in game music on. it ties everything together."
1811,"The real charm of this game wasn't the procedural guns, which were overhyped. The style, story and gameplay were the the real treasures."
1812,"tl;dr version: 
Get the second game instead, as it's a far better (but fundamentally comparable) offering.
 

Borderlands 2 is like enough to the first game to be comparable to a remake. It shares the same gameplay mechanics, concepts, bugs, stability issues, etc, but offers them with better balancing, less frequency of issues, etc. 

In Borderlands 1, level design is bland, insanely repetitive, and ugly, up until the DLC areas, which actually have some depth, detail, and variety to their design. The game is a non-stop frustration of bugs and poor design choices. From frustrations with managing inventory, to poor skill balance, to clumsy gun mechanics, to a *terrible* loot generation system, to countless bugs and other frustrations, all on top of what is essentially just an extremely bland MMORPG framework [but with fewer players running around].

In short, Borderlands 1 just isn't recommendable in any way. There's nothing whatsoever to praise about it, as it's bland and generic. There's endless things to criticize, such as the countless balance issues, interface issues, and underdeveloped systems [even within the context of a generic framework]. 

Meanwhile, Borderlands 2- while fundamentally being nearly identical to Borderlands 1- makes classes more dynamic and diverse, environments much richer, gunplay much more engaging and natural, etc, all while offering better graphics, stability, and polish. There are still things to criticize about Borderlands 2, but overall it's a recommendable offering [albeit, primairly for co-op; The single-player in Borderlands 2 is still rather unengaging, compared to the typical FPS or RPG offering].

Borderlands 1, on the other hand, simply isn't recommendable in any way. Yet again, I'm confused at the confusingly high review average of a particular game on Steam. However, on this occasion, subjective perspectives don't really have to factor in. With Borderlands 2 being so very similar, yet much more robust an offering than its predecessor, even those who would like Borderlands 1 can be assured that Borderlands 2 would still be a more recommendable purchase for them. 

If you're just looking for a way to get into the series, I'd really recommend skipping the first game and moving directly to the second. The games don't have any meaningful narrative focus (despite their aggravating choice of unskippable cutscenes [which in the first game are all the worse given that they're quite poorly done, and apparently scripted by a poorly educated, acid-tripping middle schooler] ), and thus are easy to skip individual offerings on. 

With Borderlands 2 simply offering ""more of the same, but better"", there's just no real compelling reason to play the first game, even for those who- for reasons I'm sure are beyond my comprehension- would legitimately enjoy the first game.

Well, the first game wasn't *all* bad- after all, the absurd car physics throwing your cars in the air to insane heights, random air-walking enemies, dancing corpses, and similar weird glitches, were all pretty amusing. ..probably still not something that'd contribute to a game's recommendability, however. :P

Less teasingly, the simple, straight-forward nature of the games makes them easy to pick up and play without too much mental investment, and that holds true for the first game as much as the second. If you truly want something mindless- perhaps, in the same way as I used to appreciate grind in traditional RPGs as a way of zoning out- then perhaps there may in fact be some recommendability for this first game.

That said, I'm pretty sure repetition and grind are still present in various modern FPS games and RPGs (respectively), so it's not as though this is actually offering anything distinctive. :P"
1813,"This game was my childhood game growing up. I spent so many hours of my life playing Borderlands, looting, making friends, and having fun. It is by far one of the best games I have ever played. The story is amazing, and makes me hunger for more. The gameplay is fantastic, challenging even at the higher levels. And It is just absolutely fun to play."
1814,it is more fun on steam then on consle
1815,Meh...
1816,=) good franchaise good game 10 out of 10
1817,Classic.  Love to come back to this game and play again and again.
1818,"Comparing this game to any of the other releases is like putting a piece of $%€! side by side with a bar of gold. 
The game is very raw and expect to do a lot of .cfg manipulation, but killing mobs is always fun I guess.

Dear god the story could not have ended any worse than it did.

And even though the game majorly sucks ass in a big way, I would still recommend playing it so you're up to speed with the whole BL franchise."
1819,Very entertaining no matter the console you play on lots of fun expansions are great hours upon hours upon hours of replayability in this game and the rest of the series. the artwork is great for the way this game flows. upgrade system is something that you can feel yourself getting stronger. i have encountered bugs on xbox 360 but they didn't impact the game play whatsoever.
1820,h
1821,"The original! Great graphic style, humorous yet desperate story.
Perfect 2 player coop game."
1822,Great game and a true classic
1823,amaaazingu
1824,great game all round
1825,I love this game it was the first game that I really got into on my xbox 360 and I tell everyone that love games to give it a try because it got me hooked from the start all the way to borderlands 3 love the series and always will. So if you got time or it's on sale give one try you won't regret it or if you do you hate this type of game.
1826,"Been playing this game since I had my PS3 and I cant even remember the amount of times I've beaten the game, I fell in love with the series and this game just brings back so much good memories so this is basically a huge chunk of my childhood. Love the hell out of this game"
1827,I keep coming back to this game when I just need to relax. You choose the pace.

1834,Its a good introduction to Borderlands 2
1835,"The original Borderlands still holds up in my opinion. Maybe there is a bit of nostalgia for this installment on my part, as it was my introduction to the series, but the game is still a blast to play through. The gunplay will feel dated, but oddly satisfying for a lot of gamers even to this day. The story isn't anything to boast about, and if you're used to the endless amount of dialogue in Borderlands 2, The Pre-Sequel, and Borderlands 3 then you will definitely notice the drop in NPC interaction in this game on top of the fact that most of the story is given to you via text instead of voice acting. It's great however, to the see the beginnings of the original Vault Hunters, Moxxi, Athena, Marcus, Zed, and of course CL4P-TP. It's still at least worth one playthrough of the main campaign and the DLCs."
1836,"I don't know what lies beyond the first town simply because it's so difficult to get past. I've completed shooters, stealth, and action games. I've beaten Dead Space 2 using only the Plasma Rifle. But the mechanics in this game for accuracy and shielding just made combat too much of a mess, and I don't find it enjoyable at all."
1837,"Borderlands Game of the Year. Fun when playing with a friend. For me it was not that easy to understand at the beginning, but after few shots etc. I got the idea. It has guns and enemies to shoot at and it gives all that in fun and challenging way. Graphics are different than in most games, like comic style? Overall good game and worth the money if bought in bundle."
1838,just a really fun game
1839,"Borderlands is a modern classic by this point id say. A crazy amount of weapons, interesting and funny characters, lots of different locations, large addition of extra DLC, fun but some what dated gun mechanics. My only 2 big problems with the game would be its a little slow at the start, and the ending is a bit anticlimactic. Overall its still a really fun game, worth a play if you haven't already"
1840,"what can i say that hasn't been said already.
i play all borderlands mostly on xbox with my nephew 
(hes pretty beast) i love everything about this game it's always a great time"
1841,Better than Borderlands 2 despite the Metacritic score.  Don't trust metacritic for sequels to popular first games.
1842,"I recommend this to everyone of the appropriate age to play this game.

This game is a little graphically demanding, but it should run well on most modern systems.

The game play is a little difficult to get used to, and the style of game that it is can also be a little hard to get used to. However, this does not affect the game. For me personally it added a certain skyrim/fallout feel to the game making it an enjoyable, yet familiar experience.

The game is also at a rather reasonable price."
1843,"The first 'big game' title I played on PC back when I had my old non-gaming Toshiba Satellite laptop. Even then, it ran relatively smooth. Fun gameplay, fun story, good co op.

Would play again esp for nostalgia.

Solid game 10/10"
1844,"Awesome crossover of FPS and RPG! 
Totaly enjoyable, bit shorter then I'd like even with DLCs imo. Don't expect any high graphics since game is using comic kind graphic. Gameplay is pretty smooth, no need to farm lvls since respawn of enemies is kinda fast so it can be annoying sometimes.

Kinda don't like fact, that in order to get maxed lvl u need to play story 2 times. 1st from lvl 0 and then if u want to continue lvling (getting achievments and chalanges), u need to play it 2nd time (Playtrough 2). Someone may like, I kinda don't. I woud dpreffer longer story, but whatever. :V Yes, I intend to play it again for achievments. :D

Totaly go for Enhanced version! I've read what it does after I finished story. Now I regret it a bit.? 

Anyone still playing it and want co-op? Kinda want thoose achievments too. :D Just send me PM if u want."
1845,The beginning of the best looter shooter series there is.

1860,This is my favorite series of games. I have been playing them since the day the first one came out. I have them all on Xbox and I have this one on steam. Every now and then I like to play through them again. I am sure that if you are reading this that you know what the Borderland series is all about already. But if you don't then give it a try and you will see plenty of action and lots of different guns. There is not much of this game that would be considered grinding through.
1861,"fun meter

10/10"
1862,very good game bad graphics but they are good for a 2009 game i recommendit to a lot of peaple
1863,It's a mediocre FPS with Diablo style loot. There is nothing all that special about it.
1864,"Nice game, if you have played borderlands 2 before definitely play this one too, you will like it. It has less guns and such but still has the same kind of gameplay."
1865,good gamestory
1866,good
1867,"I think I liked it at the time, maybe?"
1868,Crazy Game. *whip cracking sound* *boi-oi-oing* *wap wap wap wow sound effect*
1869,very fun
1870,Its very fun if a little dated.
1871,I said yes because they didn't offer maybe.
1872,its my fiance's and my favorite game to play together
1873,[h1]7/10[/h1]
1874,Borderlands is such a good game. A must play...
1875,"awesome game , with great story and dlc , and the guns are freaking Awesome"
1876,Games great. I have enjoyed the game since it was first released. My only issue so far has been it likes to freeze when i get to certain cut scenes in game. Help on that would be appreciated.
1877,This game is awesome!
1878,"Not bad, but far from Borderlands 2's superiority."
1879,great grpahic and guns an character were amazing
1880,"The OG looter shooter. Fun loot, characters, and an amazing letdown aka the last boss. Overall u cant really go wrong if u haven't played it. Although now that i think of it. Go play the remastered version. 8/10"
1881,"it is very good but i have been playing borderlands 2 more so i never saw the ending so yeah maybe ill get to it some time
"
1882,"The quintepitomialepistiomelogicalssential rooty tooty looty shooty game that everyone should play at least once or ten times. ""Whatchu want?!"""
1883,"An awesome shoot and loot game. Different characters for different playstyles, but not a determining factor. Would definitely recommend it to people who like these type of games."
1884,very good game i loved playing it and there is so much to do! It could take you a month or even longer to complete it!
1885,"to gooofd

"
1886,"Loved the original, can't stand a single one of the sequels."
1887,"I played this game with my friend recently, and I have to say, it is pretty good. It is kind of hard to say what the story is like since there aren't many cutscenes and there are even fewer in multiplayer I've been told by my friend (who had played through it once before). Still, it seems pretty straight forward, find lost treasure by any means necessary. No one really comes for the story here though, just the gameplay and possibly the lore (if you want story, play Tales From the Borderlands by Telltale, it is very good). The humor ranges from cringey to chuckle inducing. The gameplay is very fun, the abilities your character has gives you a nice edge over opponents and level up in creative ways too. The gun variation is ridiculous, and each has their own unique flavor that makes the game pretty fun and strategic in a sense. The only problem is, since the game is very loot based, there is a LOT of grind, but it is arguably a fun grind since the gameplay is solid. The multiplayer is what will make or break the game for you, however. If you don't have a friend to play this with, then don't get it because there's not much to drive you forward alone, and the random people you match with either have no microphones or are a*******. The voice acting is pretty good, and the sound design while repetitive can be funny at times. The cartoon-esque graphics are well done IMO and give the game a sort of timeless feeling that matches well with the tone of the game."
1888,Borderlands is my first time playing FPS and it made sure it wouldn't be the last. I really enjoy it.
1889,the game is a great game I have found what I like and I hope you do to.
1890,yes
1891,BOOM! BOOM! BANG BANG BANG BANG!
1892,"Classic game sees some aging on modern systems. 

I love this series, and have owned it on a few consoles over the years. It's unfortunately becoming increasingly dated feeling. I honestly have a hard time playing this game and enjoying it. Controls feel wrong, graphics seem...off? I'm not sure if the problem is playing it on a modern PC, but it definitely isn't as enjoyable as it once was.

Interestingly, I don't have a problem with it on either consoles. Perhaps it's because they are hardware locked, and always will play mostly the same. In any case - I can't really recommend this game outside of a STEEP discount. Feel the same way with Borderlands 2 unfortunately.

GOTY or bust. Even still....6/10.   =("
1893,really deserves its GOTY title
1894,"Does not hold up at all in 2020: awful controls where you need to keep your right mouse button pressed and then press the left button to shoot; the camera has sort of a ""zoomed in"" effect that is extremely disorienting (possibly from poorly converting a 4:3 game to 16:9?); the menu interface is not properly ported to PC (mouse wheel won't work, nor arrow keys)...

The disorienting camera is particularly egregious and I have never been made motion-sick by a game before, I've been playing fast-paced FPS games from the original Doom to Half-Life, Unreal/Unreal Tournament, Cube 2: Sauerbraten (some of which are very much nausea-inducing for a lot pf players but never bothered me at all) and even more modern ones like Warframe. I'd love to understand how can a ""game of the year"" edition be this bad compared to basically any other game, past or present. EDIT: see comment for why camera is so bad.

At this point I'm 90% sure that the only people who genuinely love this game are riding the nostalgia wave hard or maybe playing on gamepad even on PC, which is [i]seriously[/i] backwards for FPS. I can safely say any number of free-to-play FPS games on Steam are more worthy than this joke of a 10-year-old game still being sold at full-price.

I honestly bought this with the intention of experiencing the ""masterwork"" loot system after reading so much about it (even sometimes praised over BL2!) but I can't even get that far when the most basic features of gameplay and user experience are so very terrible."
1895,"Comes as advertised. You get a mission, you complete the mission, repeat until the area is cleared, and move on. I don't get most of the humor, but it's not forced and is easily ignored. Not a deep game at all; just run around and kill things. Simple, direct and fun."
1896,fun good epic yay
1897,"Played the game at release, before it was on Steam. Still playing the original it is very good. If you play FPS give this one a go. Multiplayer on co-op was pretty fun, never did PVP though. Not sure if the multiplayer functions still work now in 2020. Best get the whole package deal with all the DLC.  Dr Neds zombie island is the best one of the 4."
1898,"Borderlands is a polished, first-rate looter shooter seamlessly designed to entertain and to keep you playing, i.e. by rewarding you with loot!  Go on quests, collect loot, rinse, repeat...

The first-person shooting mechanics and game-play are solid and both generally have a smooth feel. The controls are not too complicated, and the unique visual style still holds up today (11 years since release as I write this!).

In my opinion the story is forgettable, nonsensical at times, and serves merely as an excuse for well designed fetch quests. However, the writing and voice acting are great: funny, irreverent, and filled with witty/dark humor.  
The ending to the main story was abrupt and confusing, but it leads well into the DLC, and I assume, the sequel Borderlands 2, which I have yet to play.  And since this is an older game, the online component while still alive is not quite as robust as it once was. 

Bottom line: A fun, approachable looter shooter that is definitely worth buying at a discount. 
"
1899,"fun when tiny men attack
"
1900,yes
1901,"I've got 1395 hours in this game in singleplayer mode and I'm re-installing it after a 2 year break. IMHO, this was the best of the Borderlands games. If you like a big open world and shooting bad guys, this is the game for you."
1902,its fun on its own but better with friends
1903,"Awesome game, played it through a million times, never gets old! TIP: buy when its on sale"
1904,"Its borderlands, you either love it or you have no soul"
1905,Fun to play with friends. Going back to replay in single player after 6 years away!
1906,dope
1907,"Only play this if you really want to, BL2 is better in pretty much every way."
1908,great game
1909,"Only cons of this game are big optimalization problems against borderlands 2, but if you're tolerant you can have many entertaining hours."
1910,"Great game, still holds up nearly perfectly. Only complaints are lack of windowed fullscreen FOV, slider (which can be fixed by editing a .ini file), and mostly lacking endgame. 9/10."
1911,Classic
1912,Has anyone have a problem BL1 it not saving the when you are done...
1913,"Kick ass action and loot, plus an rpg system."

1917,super fun great story
1918,Best Game!!!
1919,A re-release can't save this game from it's growing pains. Play any other Borderlands instead.
1920,Very fun ! Good FPS combat mixed with RPG elements. A classic that many will enjoy.
1921,Guns
1922,10/10
1923,The game starts out pretty slow but once it gets going its very enjoyable. If you buy this game you need to get the dlc. If you can only get one DLC buy the secret armory of general knoxx it gives you an extra 11 levels and has a boss that is great for grinding rare loot. I'd recommend you try to buy this while it is on sale.
1924,Awesome Game.
1925,Best game in the serious.
1926,/
1927,"One of my favorite FPS games out there.. Its fun and original. I'd say I enjoy playing the game completely except for when it feels a bit grindy, and yet I can not stop playing the next mission and the next after that... But that is normal even for a lot of my favorite games. Definitely a must have. I haven't played much of the 2nd one, but that one is supposed to blow you away too, maybe its even better. Highly recommend. Buy and play this one first, I've read reviews where people are spoiled by the later games in the series."
1928,"[h1] The game that started the looter-shooter revolution!... [/h1]

[b]What It Is:[/b]
A looter shooter, THE looter shooter, that started the franchise that is now Gearbox' baby. It's a huge bundle of fun, especially the DLC for the original which featured even more of the crass and lovable humor of the series.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Pick from some unique classes, battle aliens/raiders/zombies/mechas, and get all that sweet sweet loot. Shoot, shoot, shoot and turn in the quests to get more things that shoot!

[b]Controls:[/b]
Mouse and keyboard or controller. Either works just fine.

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
Not super hard but enough of a challenge to stay entertained.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
Good. The art style can leave a bit to be desired at times, but it all looks great, like most of the BL franchise their concept art style here in the beginning holds strong.

[b]Audio:[/b]
Still pretty good all things considered, the voice acting is still good and the lines are still funny. The gun sounds are a little less punchy and satisfying compared to newer titles though.

[b]Replay Value:[/b]
Very high, choose another class and build another walking tank. It's so fun.

[b]What I Like:[/b]
Great shooter, fun and unique classes, and it still plays as good as the first time I picked it up.

[b]What I Don't[/b]
I don't really think I can say that much about this game. The vehicles are still my least favorite part of this series, and that hasn't changed since this game.

[b]Judgement[/b]
It probably comes as no surprise that I would still heavily recommend this game."
1929,"10 Words or less:
Like Borderlands but it is Borderlands"
1930,yess
1931,"The game was probably really good back in the days, but now after all those new bl releases, it feels like shitty mobile game, that someone ported to pc.
The gunplay feels bad, the animations feel also bad.
I mean I fully understand that this is old af game, but it's completely pointless to bother with it since we have newer and better titles."
1932,good
1933,"I played the second one first, so this one was quite a struggle to go through. The first half of the game I didn't actually know what is happening. But the game is still good."
1934,amazing especially for a loot whore like me
1935,Best with friends.
1936,Where it all began...
1937,"[h1] Time to play, TIME TO PLAY! [/h1]
Borderlands is a looter-shooter set on Pandora, a fictive planet filled with various opportunists. Four of them are vault hunters, the playable characters: Roland as the soldier, Mordecai as the hunter, Lilith as the siren and Brick as himself. Every character supports a different playstyle and three different main skill builds, resulting in [b]12[/b] different game experiences and allowing you to find the playstyle that suits you the best.
The landscape and atmosphere feel post-apocalyptic in a MadMaxian way: there is all the rust, dust and dirt you can imagine. And sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
Anyway, here are some points worth mentioning:

Borderlands GOTY has all of the four DLCs published in one package with tens of hours of extra content.

My greatest complaint is the narrow field of view. Imagine running around with your hands on your temples, blocking the view to the sides. It's not a problem in a long-range combat but anything in a two-meter-radius will be hard, if not impossible, to find.
Also, some might be annoyed by the lack of minimap. I wasn't bothered, since I was too busy being bothered by the lifeless NPCs. The game's immersion breaks due to stationary NPCs and their repeatitive voicelines. [spoiler][i]Didja hear? We lost Jess to the rakks. [/i][/spoiler]  At least the game's fitting soundtrack helps maintaining the immersion.
I liked the challenge system and weapon proficiencies, I really did. It's a shame the challenges become useless in the end: the EXP rewards are ridiculously low, making me prefer BL2's [i] badass rank[/i] system.

Good luck finding the Vault.
[i] Try not to die! [/i] - Zed"
1938,"EDIT: My original review of this game appears to have been overly critical of the early stages of the game. After beating Playthrough 1 and 2, I would now recommend the game, but to fans of the Borderlands franchise only.
Casual fans of RPG's and/or FPS's would be better off purchasing the Handsome Collection containing Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel with all their respective DLC. It costs less than Borderlands: GOTY Edition when both are on sale and provides a much improved gaming experience compared to this older title due to several quality of life changes including fast travel in the DLC, immediate fast travel unlock in the base game, more impactful talent trees and a more refined, level-appropriate looting system (my first epic in this game was a Level 22 SMG I looted at Level 10). Additionally, the UI is updated with some much needed improvements and the characters come alive thanks to more numerous voice acting lines than are found in Borderlands. 
In conclusion, not a bad game, particularly for fans of RPG's or FPS's, but I can't understand the logic for putting a higher price tag on this less-refined game than the Handsome Collection. For your first Borderlands experience, go there first. If you like what you see and need to see how the story began, then this is probably worth picking up. Though, most of the story is told retrospectively between BL2 and BL:TPS."

1949,great game with a good mix of rpg and fps elements
1950,I highly recommend waiting for a sale to pick this game up. While it is still good the 2nd one is better.
1951,"I played a lot of borderlands 1 before I got into PC gaming. BL1 is one of those historic games that maybe gameplay and graphics wise doesnt feel like it holds up anymore but the lessons we learned about what the looter shooter genre would evolve into will stay with us forever. If you would like to check out this game I highly recommend the Enhanced GOTY version, gives the game a much needed facelift and QoL changes."

1957,YEAH
1958,"The beginning to one of the best open world FPS games to come out. Borderlands is truly a great game to play alone or with a group of friends.

The only downside to this classic is that some of the mechanics haven't aged as well as others but with the Enhanced edition just coming out not to long ago this is truly a great time for a revisit of this classic."
1959,The cult classic that started it all for the looter shooter genre. Awesome story and awesome weapons mixed with the quality of life improvements that were made for the remaster make it well worth the money.
1960,I remember playing this back in the day and loved every minute of it (except maybe the Mad Mel fight) and re-playing it all these years later is a blast from the past so massive Torgue slapped a trademark on it.

1973,"This was an unbelievably good game when it came out -- obviously aged a bit over time, but this is a game you simply must play if you love the shoot-and-loot genre (this one started it all).

There is some controversy with the developer Gearbox Software, but if you can look past that and play the game for what it is, do so. Just, please do it with a friend (or 3), as this game is simply best enjoyed with friends."

2000,This game is the YEE to my HAW and I can say it makes me Very happy
2001,"This game and the other games in the series are by far the best looter-shooter games I've played. Borderlands 1 is a great game for you and/or three other friends. One of the only negative parts of this game is that, in my opinion, it doesn't have a fair single player experience. You can tell that the game was designed for more than 1 player and thus the leveling/difficulty of playing by yourself can prove to be challenging. Otherwise, great game with fun and colorful characters with an amazing system of moving, shooting, and driving that makes you feel experienced in all of the above. If you like crazy, over the top, looter-shooter games, this is definitely a great choice."
2002,"2 is better, still fun if your bored and craving outer space wild west"
2003,"Coming to this fairly late, there's not a lot of reasons to visit the original Borderlands. The bulk of the game are thinly disguised fetch quests, with flavour text that feels a bit cumbersome to bother with after a while. The game really comes into its own around the DLC for The Secret Armory of General Knoxx, and by extention Claptrap's Robot Revolution.

Unless you're playing with others, it's an incredibly dry experience. Unless you're a completionist, I'd strongly advise skipping ahead to Borderlands 2 instead."
2004,"Better than the enhanced in my opnion, even better with all the DLC's, very fun all round tho it is oldish so can be clunky at times but very fun -might be weird if you're used to the newer games though."
2005,"To put it simply, the combat of Borderlands doesn't quite hold up to its sequel. However, the story does, finding a better working mix between serious and funny tones than the game it precedes. Whether it's a worthy trade-off is up to the individual player, but overall, the first Borderlands is at least incredibly competent in how it handles its MMO-like gameplay systems. The DLC is likewise so, if not a tad unmemorable."
2006,"I really think this is a good game, especially for people with pretty bad computers, like myself, and can't run other  games, this is a good pick"
2007,Played this game 10 years ago when it first came out. Brings back old memories. A nice game to play solo or with friends.

The variety in guns is impressive, the names of the guns color coded to mark rarity.  From most common to most rare is white, green, blue, purple, orange.  The game provides a nifty way to remember.  ""When Grandma Barks, Patrick Obeys."" See? Easy.  

I will do a fuller review when I finish the game but I can tell you that this game is worth it.  And when the enhanced version came out, if you had the game, you got it for free, and your base game was upgraded to the GOTY version, also for free. So nice of them."
2042,hmm succ
2043,"Thematically speaking, this Borderlands has the best music, story and vibe. Though not the best gameplay. It has one of the most overpowered sirens ever, Lilith. And playing a lvl 69 Lilith on 2.5 is very fun. The guns are standard compared to BL2. There are less special effects and what not. But they can be brutally efficient. 

The biggest downfall is the best gameplay only comes after you beat the main boss of the game twice, and THEN finally everything is your level. If only you could have everything level up with you with out having to beat the game twice, that would be legit. I kinda prefered 2.5 playthrough difficulty in BL1 vs the BL2 Ultimate Vault Hunter, which is fun but just full of cheap asss deaths cuz of the difficulty increase. This means if I want to chill on a max level borderlands I tend to play BL1.. if I want to sweat I play BL2"

2046,"One of the best game franchises out there. Worth it if you've never played it. If you have played it before, still worth it :P"
2047,Best Game ever
2048,Highly nostalgic game would recommend to anyone looking for some good fun
2049,Old clappp
2050,[h1][b]<3[/b][/h1]
2051,"Gameplay-wise, [spoiler] cough cough weapon/enemy level scaling [/spoiler]  better than BL2 IMO. Also you should play it first if you wanna know what's going on in BL2"
2052,Played the first one the last. A lot better than I expected.
2053,cool
2054,"Not the greatest game in the Borderlands franchise but if you're looking it get into the games this is a good place to start.
Its got solid shooting mechanics and a pretty good story. There are 4 playable characters which allows for a lot of replayability."
2055,"The original Borderlands, improved and remastered.  Give it a go with some friends!"
2056,Shit
2057,it good
2058,its good
2059,"Absoluut best!! The humour, the cel-shaded graphics, and the near infinite range of weapons still stands up very well. Excellent four-player co-op action. Some welcome refinements and tons of content."
2060,So much YES
2061,
2062,"Good Story, graphics, and fun time playing with friends."
2063,"Great game that has truly lasted the test of time.  Still play this all the time with friends as it is so easy to multiplayer.

Just make sure you turn up the graphics before starting !!!"
2064,рестайлинг первой борды👍
2065,sick
2066,"love the game, it is a game that all can play XD, velkro aproved :D"
2067,Nice.
2068,it's gud
2069,"Kinda strange to discover this game after playing the sequel. You can understand why this game succeeded and how the franchise started. But playing BL1 after 2 isn't the play. The game gets really boring fast compared to Borderlands 2, and the visual is not yet at the enjoyable state the series would ultimately reach. Would still recommend though."
2070,sexy
2071,good game
2072,"a very nice fps game with interesting style
"
2073,Possibly a favourite game of all time.
2074,:)
2075,"One of my favorite games, ending a bit anti-climatic though"
2076,"So fun to blow head off
It's only boring when I do the quests in the wrong order.
I kinda did not play every contents, but I will try it on the remake version.

9/10"
2077,Hell Yeah!
2078,"Funny game, best to be played with friends."
2079,Without a doubt one of the greatest distractions from my unimportant and meaningless existence. 10/10
2080,"Still have the original on disc and loved it, and also have the GOTY edition on steam. Its probably my favorite. I recommend it."
2081,"Compelling game, it absolutely deserves your hard earned money or else your parents cash. What i like about it pretty much every aspect of it, weapons, characters, the world. Its a beautiful game after all."
2082,"At last a multiplayer game that gets it right. Just link up with your friends and play the game. Graphics are nicely done. You do get the feeling you do more shopping then anything else in the game sometimes, but that's the nature of the beast. fun guaranteed."
2083,really good game with friends
2084,Epic game!
2085,"MANO........ essa franquia me consumio durante um ano todo e ter o 1 ""melhorado"" para jogar foi uma das melhores coisas q a 2K fez ate hoje"
2086,"This game is actually a surprisingly boring MMO. It also contains many MMO features you wouldn't expect to see in a shooter or even a competent MMO like enemies that you can't fight til you level up right next to the starting area.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRY3dKpRskE

You can't trust the user score for this game btw because steam decided this game was getting review-bombed so they excluded a period with negative reviews from the user score.

Battleborn story mode was actually a MUCH better game but the people at 2K have decided to shut it down so that it will become completely unplayable even in single-player. (They could easily release a patch for offline play I'm sure but why do that when you can just rip people off?)

""Games as a service"" is fraud and 2K are some of the worst offenders.

2087,Got the GOTY and the free upgrade to the enhanced was nice.
2088,It's number one in a great storyline. It's the beginning to sooo much goodness. but not cl4ptr4p he's a weasley butt nugget.
2089,"Borderlands borders between repetitive and empty gameplay.

For a game that was released over 10 years ago, the content of this first person shooter did not hold up well to the test of time.  I purchased a used copy of this game way back when it came out on the PS3, but never picked it up and played it.  There it sat in my library, as I was too busy working to find the time.

Fast forward 10 years, add a friend for online co-op, and we played through the game in roughly 40-50 hours over a 2 month period.  First impressions of the game had me thinking, ""This could be fun!"" and ""I love the art style!"" and of course ""Isn't ClapTrap just the funniest cool robot you'd ever want to interact with?"".  Then came the campaign....

Little did I know that the entire game is filled with, ""Get a mission, run (or drive) to this location, collect some items or kill some enemies, return, repeat"".  The entire time, the talk of the mysterious vault keeps you motivated and full of anticipation.  ""What could possibly be in there that everyone is so eager to find it?  What will happen once we get there?  How amazing will it be?  What kind of twists and secrets will we find?""  The suspense kept me playing.

Every mission turned into attempting to manage the amount of loot I collect so I can turn it in for cash and checking each weapon's stats to see if I can occasionally find something more powerful than what I already have.  Soon, I find that the loot management becomes half the game, and eventually, I stop paying attention to many of the stats, just focusing on any weapons that have larger jumps in damage.  And speaking of damage, the enemies are bullet sponges.  Don't expect to go around feeling like a bad-ass merc taking out groups of bandits.  Instead, get ready to dump bullets into your enemies, making the game way longer than it needs to be.

If the actual play style wasn't that monotonous or repetitive, half way through the game, throw in the self-centered Patricia Tannis.  You'll be running missions for her and listening to her logs.  I honestly wanted the ability to shoot person instead of fulfilling her missions.  Her self-centered commentary, which at first seemed quirky and funny, soon turns into that annoying friend who has delusions about how great they are and constantly talks about themselves.  Just go away!

By the time you arrive close to the end game, you realize that you have more money than any human ever could amass selling used firearms, and I found myself simply ignoring all the ongoing loot drops, since none of them really did a big jump in damage up until this point, I just wanted to finish the game.

And, that Valut?  Well, get ready for disappointment.  [spoiler] The vault isn't an actual place you go into or explore.  In fact it is more like a portal that opens up to spew forth the massive mega-boss.  That sits there.  And flails around tentacles.  Once you kill it, well, that's it. No amazing ending.[/spoiler]  Joy.  Oh yes, and that mysterious woman you have visions about, that ""guides"" you on your way?"" [spoiler]Yea, no.  You never find out who or what she is either.[/spoiler]

So, yes, a person who loves a good first person shooter, this game has quite a bit to be desired.  If you have an empty library, and are constantly bored, and this game is on sale, pick it up, it will keep you busy.  If you have a backlog of multiple other games and you think this is a good addition to your collection, then I’d say skip it, move on to the second in the series, you won’t be missing much of anything by leaving this inside the Vault.

In short, the game may have been a new and amazing concept at it its initial release 10 years ago, but after so much time, you begin to see that the game is as empty as the landscapes you travel around.  Welcome to the Borderlands.

2108,"I like it!!!

Szeretem ezt a játékot. Multiban játszva még élvezetesebb."
2109,"I've played a lot of every Borderlands Game, BL2 by far the most. They're better when played in a group. Sadly not many of my friends like grinding/farming for items so they often get bored, so I've had to play alone for the most part. I recommend all of the Borderlands Franchise Games."
2110,Fixes most of the originals issues
2111,!

2133,The best F-ing game ever!
2134,good  old game
2135,"It's the original. I wasn't an FPS fan before this game. I wanted to be, but I'm old and I sucked. I'm still not terribly good, but no longer terrible. This game is why. I prefer the post-apocalyptic themes. It's always on sale, if you don't have it, get it. Not only is it a fun game to play, it's funny too."
2136,This game is great for a shoot and loot with friends. i have enjoyed many hours with this game over multiple platforms and i still enjoy playing this.
2137,Dumb fun.
2138,It's a good game to kill time with. The story line is also funny so i'm sure you'll get a kick out of NPC dialog through out the game.
2139,It's a classic
2140,"it is a very fun and story driven ""shooter-looter"" game."
2141,The first and one of the best. Nice pace. Does not overwhelm as arcade games do. Unusial graphics
2142,"fantastic
"
2143,Krom's lightning repeater.
2144,"An oldie but still a goodie, and even though you have to use Proton if you want to play in Linux like I do, it works 98% - enough to complete the game and all it's DLC's.  Using Proton does throw up an error sometimes, but you can ignore it and play on as long as you leave the error box unchecked in the background.  It is a shame that a Linux-native port will likely never happen, but it works well enough in Proton/Wine for it to not matter that much.  A classic game that I like to return to every now and again."
2145,uwu
2146,Where it all started
2147,The best game ever made no more aords needed 👌+++
2148,AMAZING Co-Op game!
2149,Cannot get past mission finding sniper rifle parts. Parts are missing not even existing! i get its a scavenger hunt but dang not this hard
2150,i like it
2151,Just beat the main questline of the game and it was fucking awesome. Now I'll be playing all the DLC's.
2152,good
2153,fun with friends
2154,"It's a good fun game. Not a lot to say about it apart from what's already been said, this being a fairly old title."
2155,Heyoooooooo
2156,"this game is terrible 

i want to kill it"
2157,it is fun
2158,DO NOT BUY
2159,it good
2160,I love this game series. SO AWESOMEEEE :)
2161,"[h1]Solid game, but there is another[/h1]
[b]First off, there is a enhanced version of this game, so you should be looking at that instead of this. [/b]

This is a solid game. However, its just not as good as Borderlands 2 in basically every regard. Story, Dialog, Gunplay, Visuals, and just the rhythm of fighting. Again this is a solid title. However, I can't see myself recommending a game when there is a better alternative.
If you are interested in Borderlands, Great! I would recommend you start on Borderlands 2. If you finish that game and want more I still think I would recommend you replay Borderlands 2 or pick up Borderlands 3 before this game."
2162,"Gearbox's release of Borderlands: Game of the Year Edition even ten years after its original release, Borderlands is still a great co-op experience, which looks great thanks to its ""cell-shading"" graphics Mechanical and visual improvements solidify Borderlands has always been a fun, beautiful game that was quite forward-thinking despite some things not aging well."
2163,Good run and gun and a story to boot
2164,gud game
2165,"After completing the game too many times to count I can say this game is awesome. It's old, though it still holds up with it's cool variety of enemies, bosses and most importantly loot! Choose a character from the 4 and hop in, either solo or with friends!"
2166,"This game and its series is amazing I would play this a million times over
"
2167,"I'm going to be frank: this game is a dumpster fire. Yes, many people love it because it is ""quirky"", and ""different"", but it's really, really awful. By default, the field of view is locked to some awful setting that gives a large percentage of players motion sickness, and you have to mod the game in order to correct it. Then there's the gameplay itself. That really nice weapon you got at level 10? You'll probably still be using it at level 50 because you can't find anything better. This is because all weapons stats are completely random and finding a weapon that's actually good is like winning the lottery.

Then there's the fact that much of the DLC content is level-restricted to Level 50, and the only way to get there is via NewGame+. But in NewGame+, the game becomes more ""difficult"" by making all enemies take more hits, until it gets to the point where a midget can take 3 or 4 shots to the head from a sniper rifle before dying. Remember what I said about never finding better weapons? Yeah. The enemies get tougher, but your weapons don't get better to match. So you're eventually put in an unwinnable situation where you simply do not have enough firepower to survive.

I have heard that Borderlands 2 solves most of these problems, but the first game basically ruined the franchise for me. It put me off so much that I just can't get into it anymore."
2168,"If you like games that are based on achievements.  This is good.
A bit repetitive.  You can often find that you are levels above everything 
else, but then you get your butt kicked by some BOSS.  If you happen to
get into a higher level sooner than you should.  It will suck."
2169,I really love steele's character arc
2170,"Such a good game, never gets old, could play for years, not a single gameplay is the same
"
2171,good game for the age. like a fine wine
2172,The most playable game on any PC that you can ever experience. I recommend you guys to play for at least for 2 weeks then you will see a difference.
2173,Best of the series
2174,fun
2175,Child Hood Game. Brings back memories..
2176,Great Game
2177,"If you've got a lot of time to spend and you don't know what else to play, then this is a great game for you. But if you haven't played borderlands 2 or borderlands 3, then you should go spend time on those games instead."
2178,"The original Borderlands was and still is one of the best FPS games ever made. It is packed with plot, originality, jokes, and cartoon like graphics that make the game more fun. Overall this game is very fun and I would recommend for everyone."
2179,Good game recommend buying
2180,"this game is very nice, i like playing this game so much!!"
2181,"As a huge fan of Borderlands 2, I couldn't get into this game. The shooting mechanics are mostly the same, but the game feels humorless, the writing is dull, the playable characters are better-represented in the sequel as NPCs, and the game takes itself too seriously. 

For the best Borderlands experience out there, play Borderlands 2."
2182,"its awesome
"
2183,7/10
2184,Best co-op game out there. It combines elements of both FPSs and RPGs into fun gameplay. Highly recommended!
2185,Solid first person shooter!
2186,"Is it no longer possible to buy *just* the Borderlands GOTY? Are you required to also spend money on the ""Enhanced"" edition?"
2187,"It is a well made game. The Enhanced version is probably a bit better on a modern machine, but if you have an older machine or one that has a weaker intel card, this should be fine and fun."
2188,"This is an iconic shooter at this point. Tons of stuff to do and explore, and though it's a wasteland, there's stuff everywhere to find. I don't know what else to say but that it's hilarious, and awesome."
2189,GG
2190,"Love it, by far my favorite Borderlands game"
2191,"Played this game on original release on the PS3 console. Still come back to it every few months. Solid classic. A bit dated now, but still a great game."
2192,Dude... it's Borderlands... 'Nuff said...
2193,delicious. guns.
2194,one of my favorite games
2195,Do you like guns? Do you like fun? Then buy this game.
2196,The dankest of the Borderlands series
2197,it was so long ago but still great game
2198,Very nice game. I like the graphics!
2199,Thumbs Up
2200,good fun
2201,good game.
2202,It's a great game that spawned a fun game series. It has it's own personality and the comedy style compliments it well. The weapon system is pretty extensive and varied especially for it's time and I think it still holds up.
2203,Best time I ever Wasted!
2204,"I have this franchise on multiple platforms and have played for 100s of hours, each edition gets better than the last, but I still come back to previous titles to keep living on Pandora to find the best loot."
2205,Magnitudes better than Crysis 2.
2206,"[*] Satisfying gun play
[*] Tons of weapons, shields, and helpful items
[*] Four unique and equally fun-to-play characters
[*] Distinct, appealing artistic style
[*] Great system of rewards

Overall a great game to play solo or with a buddy"
2207,great game
2208,good shit this game
2209,"The open world can seem too intense to take in at once but once you start tracking down objectives and completing bounties while traversing the world, the open world of Pandora feels comfortable to explore."
2210,Incredible game with original graphics! The open world has a great atmosphere that I haven't seen in other games.
2211,"Fun Epic Gamer Game. Epic Gamers Only, Please.
"
2212,"One of the classics in over-the-top scifi FPS. Countless weapons to choose from, countless enemies to use them on. Great for long-haul play due to the many DLCs and the replay value (where your enemies get stronger but the loot BETTER) or just a couple of bang-bangs to get that itch out of your virtual trigger finger."
2213,"got me started on rpgs when i was younger , the story is there but not shown to well , it did age poorly in my opinion , the aiming is bad unless leveled up , but i did have fun with the game, i enjoyed the classes , roland lilith and mordecai are my fav , dlc is also fun , being a fan of zombies dr ned is my fav dlc i would recommend this to anyone into rpgs with replayable value"
2214,"Like the variety of areas to explore and different foes
Other games have a lot of flashing going on while shooting
Leveling up was lengthy thou"
2215,yuh
2216,"The OG of loot shooters. 

Some of the DLC is a little clunky and poorly paced, and this game begins a trend of Gearbox not being able to make a decent boss fight to save their life, but the feeling of cruising around the arid wastes with a friend or three, shooting enemies and squabbling over loot...well, it spawned a thousand imitators. A classic."
2217,"Dark humour, great guns, deep feeling of immersion, GORE! Honestly one of the best sci-fi shooter series i've ever played, Borderlands 2 is my favourite, but they are all great games!"
2218,"This game is one of my all time faves!
This game is a must HAVE!
FPS RPG cant go wrong with this game! Online multi and same pc co-op! Makes for some amazing laughs and team work!"
2219,"Love this game series! Graphics, NPCs, stories, etc. HIGHLY recommend for anyone who wants a good FPS to play solo or with friends. Go forth and loot, my friends."
2220,.
2221,"Its a boring, forgettable, generic, ugly looking(brown,gray,green)  fps. There are far better shooting games with better more interesting stories and environments. Also, there's a lot of crude humor in this game. Crude immature humor."
2222,Looooooooooooooooooooot!
2223,Absolutly Recomended
2224,THIS GAME IS SO TRASH OH MY LORD OH MY GOD Allah will smite you down you blasphemous fiend.
2225,funny story great voice acting
2226,this is preety cool
2227,An MMO FPS but its just you and your buds. Also every downside of that description you can imagine...
2228,It was a fun time for a bit of an older game. :)
2229,"Definitely get the enhanced version (for less than 10$ only) unless you intend to play this on a low spec PC. If you are going for this version, I'd say 5$ is the highest reasonable price."
2230,"gunssssssssssssssssssssssss
"
2231,Good Game! Love the Blood!
2232,"I don't recommend it to anyone who wants to play together with his friends on LAN. 
They removed LAN support. 
It became worse than the first version of it.
Due to anti-piracy greediness, it is not lag-free anymore."
2233,"Okay so this is a decently made port of Borderlands. It does leave a lot to desire but is still super enjoyable. One of the biggest problems is that if you're a new player and wanna play this with a controller the help prompts don't help at all. They're always set to the keyboard control prompts which can be confusing for new players. Luckily I played BL2 first which does include control prompts so I already knew the controls. The games cut scenes can look like garbage at times due to the motion blur feature on them. Its too intense. Nonetheless the gameplay is pretty damn good, and the story is enjoyable. I genuinely have really enjoyed my experience with the entire Borderlands series so far, and finally got around to playing this and am already enjoying it a lot. Its a good game nonetheless. In all honesty as someone who isnt usually a fan of first person shooters/shooters in general. Its amazing finding one I genuinely enjoy A LOT. Especially just the whole series. Its just really well made and, I highly recommend everyone tries this at least once. Even if you dont like the art style or shooters you'll probably still have a blast. There's no other series like Borderlands."
2234,very nice
2235,"Honestly, the game is clunky nowdays.

But still very good, i would recommend it for the story and to see where it all left off...... But certainly get stuck into BL2 and BL3"
2236,Such a cool game. Makes a lot of fun to play. The only thing that bothers is the part where it's laggy while playing coop / multiplayer. Besides that it's a total recommandation. A lot of detail went into the game and a lot of play time. One of the best Shooter meets RPG.
2237,"This is a great game but Borderlands 2 is the one you should be after, this one is tougher and a little bland when it comes to weapons but it's still worth a shot."
2238,"Lots of fun, great replay value"
2239,"One of the best games of all time. So good! Borderlands 2 and beyond have better user interface refinements, but the original cannot be skipped."
2240,"I love everything about this game, but remember to SAVE before quitting in multiplayer, because someone will get desynched and have to catch up alone, that's one thing I don't like about this game."
2241,"G.O.T.Y. enhanced version is  truly amazing with its additional features. Definitely ""YES"", you can now access the 4 DLC's using the  [Enhanced Version] namely: Jakob's Cove - Zombie Island of Dr. Ned;  The Underdome - Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot; T-Bone Junction - The Secret Army of General Knoxx; and the  Tartarus Station - Claptrap's New Robot Revolution. It is on a fast portal mode...  A first-person shooter that will not ruin your eyes...guaranteed"
2242,It's a must to play tbh
2243,Who doesn't like borderlands? Seriously?
2244,got y ou
2245,"Got this game years ago, back then I didn't enjoy it one bit and didn't make it past tutorial...Came back to it after years and WOW! Cute comic-like graphics, gameplay, enjoyable good old fun :D Love it and recommend!"
2246,"If you played Borderlands 2 or TPS before this, it's gonna feel janky, but for the time it was made it's pretty good. I prefer some of its aspects over the sequels, but it's missing all of those QoL updates. Much more solo friendly than the other games tho, so if you don't plan on playing with friends it might be a good place to start."
2247,"The original Borderlands 1 GOTY is included with Borderlands Enhanced.

2248,I would buy it for a friend
2249,Online... is dead...
2250,Absolutely brilliant for chill co-op and can be run by a potato.
2251,"One of the very Best Arpg + Looting + FPS games i've played. I only play Single player but you never feel bored as a good game will make you completely immersed in the game. 

Definitely a must buy . As of current it have given me 40+ hours and yet I  still have 4 DLC + half of the series to go. 
Played some RPG, and hack and slash but Borderland is on different level. 
9/10"

2253,It's okay.
2254,:)
2255,good game
2256,"boring environments, boring gunplay, boring characters, boring everything. play bl2

Edit (2022): Not really sure why I like bl1 now but it's a laugh innit"
2257,"Go back to where it all began, in a game that still holds up remarkably well."
2258,Fun with 3 friends.
2259,Greetings traveler! There's a copy available on the Steam-Powered store!
2260,Yes
2261,"Played BL2 for 400+ hours. Bought this, played 30 hours in 2 weeks. Good stuff!"
2262,This is the BEST borderlands!
2263,"There is a reason this franchise is called the king of the looter shooters. 
It’s a fantastic game that every hardcore gamer must add to his library."
2264,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, downward drift when using a gamepad! Do not play GOTY, play GOTY Enhanced!"
2265,"Good but aged game. My largest complaint was with the assault rifles small mag size.
If you're new to the series then I'd suggest borderlands 2 GOTY.

Leaving a review because steams biased toxic immature fan base. News to you kool aid drinkers: Steam has a way worse and shady track record than the epic store (not that you fan trolls actually care). Do your research kids because you've been fooled.  None of these DRM platforms are actually a good idea and ignorant fans don't help."
2266,already bored after 20 hours
2267,yes
2268,"It's kinda dull, but I'll let it slide."
2269,🤙
2270,"It's boring. It was boring back then, it is still boring now.
Boring maps, boring color scheme, boring loot, boring repetitive quests, boring bulletsponge mechanics"
2271,didn't find it enjoyable in any way except the fact that you can play with friends
2272,"Jumping on the hate train. Good game but the developer fucking suck, making shady deals with Epic for money instead of caring about it's paying customers. Not gonna use Epic stire ever, never gonna buy from it. And this fucking deal with Borderlands 3! Never gonna buy Borderlands 3 and Gearbox is now on my developer shitlist."
2273,"NO. NO. NO.

This game runs you over with a car, shoots your head off from 10km away, stabs you with a spoon and then forces you to listen to the curse that is Claptrap. 

And I'm not even being sarcastic. This game is unplayable and unenjoyable.
Horrible choice of grapichs as well."
2274,Boring looter shooter.
2275,"very good, enhanced is good too"
2276,"The game runs fine at first but there's a memory leak that slowly saps away FPS until your system is running at a painful crawl. The game's been out for years now and they haven't bothered to fix it. 
This is my favorite game in the franchise and it irks me to no end to not recommend it but they botched the port so badly it's constantly rendered unplayable. 
The enhanced edition further shows this issue since it eats up more memory and speeds up the process. 

Please fix this, and I'll gladly recommend it."
2277,"A lot of fun to play. Very good game mechanics: You want to shoot the bad guys like in any FPS, but you also want to get that better loot and reach the next character level like in a good RPG.

Story is not that captivating and the eccentric humor is not to everyone's taste. But that can fortunately be skipped relatively quickly. Overall, good game, though Borderlands 2 is better."
2278,"Best way I can describe this game, shoot everything, grab the best loot, shoot everything again, repeat, and slowly the crazy ways you can do this get even crazier, especially if you do it with friends."
2279,"don't understand why people like Bl1. 

Story is garbage, gun-play sucks, most quests are extremely boring and the world is just ugly and has like 20 different brown tones.

I like Borderlands 2 and 3 tho, so buy these instead."
2280,epic games bad
2281,it is me the mad max himself
2282,"Borderlands was ""good"" when it was new because it was new, not because it was ever good. It's a boring, cringy, forced-joke, tedious, unfunny chore. If you haven't played it, don't. Play a newer Borderlands instead."
2283,"I put off playing this for years because I just don't care for the cel shaded aesthetic, but I have to admit that it's a pretty excellent game. Funny and fast-paced, I finally see what all the fuss is about."
2284,It's borderlands
2285,"play the none enhanced verson, try this verson has better fps,
enhanced verson lags constenly and it's badly optimised.
still fun."
2286,at least its on steam!
2287,Bad game Worse Company
2288,Developers have sold out to epic BS!
2289,i just liked the game and its tactics it made it fun and not really boring
2290,Devlopers have sold out to epic.
2291,Epic
2292,"Yes for the love of claptrap

The legend of claptrap starts here

It is a FPS shooting game with RPG with it where character have unique skill to use. 
It is also to find good LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT to kill enemies. 

Comparing to Borderlands 2 
It does not require extremely waste of time farming for gear to kill most of staff 
you just need a basic skill to AIM FOR THE HEAD (actually is critical spot) and using correct element (not gonna spoiler go find out yourself) 

But go for the enhanced version if you have played Borderlands 2
This GOTY is the original version with original UI comparing to enhanced version and does not have the special legendary Gearbox weapons to use



At last 

FCK EGS, 2k and Randy for Borderlands 3 

RIP Borderlands 3 until April where everyone ....... (we all know what game we all gonna play when it comes to Steam)"
2293,"Well, this is where the looter-shooter genre began, but if I'm being honest, this game did not age well. Maybe it's because I played Borderlands 2/Pre-Sequel first, but this game felt so primitive to me. Graphics did not age well, the story is just OK, and there's not as much weapon variety as the later games in the series. I will say, the Vault Hunters are still fun to play around with, and mashers (basically revolvers that shoot shotgun pellets) are some of the funnest weapons to use in video game history. If you really want to play this game, just get the Enhanced version."
2294,"It has a good challenge aspect, open world, plenty of weapons to choose from and it gives hours of playtime. As far as shooters go it is a good choice. I think a game should be rated on it's monies worth and this one does deliver value for the dollar. Plenty of area's to explore and lots of freedom."
2295,"""Nailed it!""

I heard Gearbox are developing BL3 right now and planning on releasing it somewhere around March 2020. Looking forward to it."
2296,10/10
2297,"old game not as good as i remember it being maybe i had lower standards back in 2010-11 maybe after 100%ing bl2 on 3 different platforms things like fov matter more to me and good UI 

have yet to play my copy of the remaster i hear that fov has sliders on there so thats a plus dunno if they reworked ui to be less annoying to deal with or not hopefully the map tab will work with controller too"
2298,"Borderlands was a thrill to play, I never felt like I was grinding away through enemies as the sheer volume of weaponry meant I was always picking up something new every few kills. Designed well, gameplay is something that stands out for this title as well as the art style allowing it age and not look awful. 

I found the story to be rather empty in some ways for a game touting RPG like elements but the customisation of your character and the endless seas of weaponry more than make up for this. It relies more on it's humour in delivering the content than full on storytelling.

A must buy for fans of any genre, don't have to be good at shooters to enjoy this one!"
2299,"Borderlands is unique in that it combines first-person-shooter gameplay with rpg elements such as levelling, quests, and loot. Lots and lots of loot.
It also has great humour from a wide variety of characters (especially Claptrap) and a story that makes sense without being too uninteresting or dragging."
2300,"Even with Borderlands 3 making its debut, going back to the beginning is often a good thing, which is why I went back to playing Borderlands.  Aesthetically, the Maliwan weapons resemble actual firearms and don't look like cartoon weapons as depicted in Borderlands 2.  I'm not scratching my head thinking, ""What is this--an SMG or a laser rifle?"""
2301,9/10
2302,Nagyon jó
2303,Good game but I can't give it a thumbs up with the Epic exclusivity of BL3
2304,"TRULY One of my FAVORITE games to EVER Play! AMAZING GAME, AMAZING LOOT, AMAZING DLC!?! This game CREATED the Looter Shooter Genre and I LOVE IT!?!"
2305,No cuz Borderlands 3 doesn't release on steam
2306,Yes.
2307,bruh
2308,"Bland, obnoxious, repetitive - three words that describe borderlands for me. I really can't see why people like this.
All(most) the guns are just randomized crap that looks like blocks of plastic and shoots like it as well. Most enemy respawns do not make sense and there are quite a few bugs.  

Not the worst game out there, and by far not one of the best, not recommended."
2309,"I don't really recommend the original Borderlands. It's not really a bad game. . .it's just kinda meh. The sequel is 100x better in every way so if you're wanting to get into the series, start with that one instead. Play this one if you're just into completing them all."
2310,"Repetitive, ultimately not fulfilling"
2311,yes
2312,"First time playing this game, even though it initially released 10 years ago. Really enjoyable game. Has kept my attention pretty well. Can't wait to get through it and move on to the second."
2313,"Great game with great jokes.
Kill everything get weapons, kill more get better weapons..etc."
2314,"it seems as though I cant put this down for the time being, like football. Always enjoy being impaled by a plate of calamari in the Noxx DLC"
2315,"Borderlands is a good game that feels dated in some ways but is fun and engaging in others. 

The multiplayer co-op is a must to fully appreciate this game. It was much more fun than playing alone."
2316,"While Borderlands is a great game on its own, if you have a choice between the original and either of its sequels, you will do yourself a huge disservice if you choose this game.

Overall:
6/10

Pros:
- Borderlands offers a radical amount of weapon choices.
- This game has really great humor and fun, lovable characters.
- The art style of this game is top-notch.

Cons:
- Rather limited enemy variety.
- While the number of guns in this game is extremely high, 99% of the guns you find will never be used, since they're just objectively worse than that rare 1% of gun that you find.

Grievances:
- A problem with the entire series is that gun rarity (except for gold) is meaningless as a green gun is objectively worse than a higher level white gun."
2317,"One of the best shooter-looter game ever. Aesthetics looks awesome and the huge amount of DLCs which adds another huge amount of details and customizations makes it an incredible game.

The game may seem quite repetitive because it's not a clear free world game, you have to follow the story line (you are not able to explore all zones if they are locked until the story moves forward) and the type of missions are more or less always the same (dungeon, loot, improve weapons, improve skills, repeat), however, the incredible amount of weapon's improvements may solve this.

Definitely should be a must have in all libraries."
2318,"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
2319,is not that good
2320,Game very very good. if you are a hardcore borderlands player play the original version. if you are new to the series or maybe not super into grinding then i would say you should play the remaster. in the end you will probably still love the game ether way.
2321,Good
2322,"Four people on a bus, four leave. These four are looking for the lost lunch box of pandora for some loot. The heroes are: Mordecai from Regular Show with his trusty side kick - Rigby, Wendy from Wendy's Twitter, a walking talking mass of muscles, and Commando Type: 1028 of the War Genre."
2323,"Unlike most franchises, the Borderlands series arguably started off with its weakest game and improved drastically with the sequel; even so, the original Borderlands contains a great deal of the charm, humor, and combat diversity that characterize the best in the series. 

That said, the non-enhanced version is probably not worth buying on its own at this point given how noticeably the retroactive improvements in the enhanced version positively affect the graphics, co-op, and gameplay (particularly the auto-collect feature and the inventory/commerce menus, which go from outlandishly inconvenient to clunky but tolerable). In general, though, Borderlands 1 is a nice enough game."
2324,"This is still on of the best games to play co-op. Pick 1-3 friends and start looting! There are 4 different characters you can choose from, each of them with a different skill tree and a unique special skill. With all the DLCs and the main game, you have a huge amount of quests, enemies, weapons and so on. I played this game back in 2010 already and I can still recommend it to everyone. Same goes for the other Borderlands games! 

And to those who give a negative review because of 2k. Stop all the hate. Of course what happened sucks, but this does not make this game any worse! I will wait with BL3 until it comes to Steam in half a year"
2325,Hard game but more fun
2326,unga bunga caveman game unga bunga borderlands 2 is better unga bunga me angry
2327,"Please note how this is basically a prequel for Borderlands 2... being said this, the game is enjoyable however it doesn't represents the best of the franchise."
2328,I've spend a bit of time with this game... I regret all of it.
2329,Take Two can succ.
2330,good game for first person shooter lovers!
2331,DO NOT BUY. DO NOT SUPPORT 2K!
2332,Highly recomend this game. The story is good and the humor is spot on.
2333,"Do not buy this game.
Do not support intimidation tactics."
2334,Such a fun game to play solo or with friends. Without the badass rank thats in the 2nd game it wont take as long to beat this one but dont let that steer you away from this amazing game. There is a lot of side missions to do and locations to explore. The DLC especially The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned and The Secret Armory of General Knoxx is some of the best borderlands material I have played. Bring a friend if you plan to to the Underdome DLC cause that can take quite a while if you do it solo
2335,"Awful remastered engine!  I keep having to restart because the frame rate gets worse and worse.  My rig (RTX 2070, 6700K, 32Gb RAM) should chew this up but there are just lots of areas that the game just slows down if there is ""too much"" to deal with.  I loved Borderlands when it came out but this engine sucks."
2336,Worth your bucks. Really good game
2337,"Its a shame, this is a good game but i can't support GearBox software and 2k publishing.
They'll sent investigators to your house to threaten you if you talk about there plans online.
And if you have a Youtube channel that mentions something 2K doesn't want you to say they will ruin you .

However, I'm only leaving it NOW for 2 reasons:

- Harassing a YTer for having a dissenting opinion

Never buying games from you lot again, especially when they're done this poorly. Y'all owe that kid an apology dude."

Do not buy this, do not support them. Try to find another way to play Borderlands cause it is a good game but we should not give them any money."
2346,"Yes, the game is fun thanks to excellent shooting mechanics, fully functional coop, an overabundance of loot, and an addictive levelling system. However, there are some huge issues with the entire series (not just Borderlands 1):

1) Awful storytelling and horrendous dialogue. This one is a pain in the ♥♥♥. The plot is next to non-existent. What little there is is uninteresting, delivered primarily in a wall of text. The dialogue tries much too hard to be funny; it's immature and relies heavily on contemporary pop culture (e.g., memes). I didn't laugh ONCE.

2) Boring and annoying characters. No characters in the series are actually interesting. They lack charm, humour, and personality outside of their one-dimensional character traits. And don't get me started on ClapTrap - that piece of junk is basically the Jar Jar Binks of the series. Okay, maybe I'm going too f - NOPE. He really is.

3) Glitches and balancing issues. The scaling system for enemies is atrocious. Some sections are ridiculously hard, while others are a cakewalk. And then there are numerous bugs that get you stuck in or underneath objects. It all just takes away from the experience.

Now, I'm not saying that the game is awful. But it's not that good, either.

NOTE: Playtime on Enhanced edition and other consoles."
2347,"f***ng mafia company, no more support. They just killed all the hype for #boycottborderlands3 #boycotttake2 , who do they think they are without us the fans of their games. I was #boycottborderlands3 'ing for 6 months already becouse of no steam release but this is unacceptable."
2348,"Randy Pitchford and Take-Two can jump off a cliff. I only bought this game to play with a friend, and cannot actually stand playing it, so this review is actually sincere. Take-Two's behavior speaks for itself, and is repugnant (the same can be said of Randy Pitchford)."
2349,nice
2350,"While its not as fast-paced or flashy as its sequel, Borderlands is a very fun game that I would recommend to any fan of the Shoot & Loot FPS genre."

I am just reviewing Borderlands not the DLC. 



[u]What I liked about the game[/u]
[list]
[*]	Awesome boss fights. The game also has a great variety of enemies to kill.

[*]	Loads of loot to be found throughout the wasteland. You are constantly on the look-out for better guns, shields, and upgrades.  

[*]	Interesting characters like the many Claptraps you will stumble across in the wastes. 

[*]	Tons of interesting side-quests. Each side-quest felt a little different. There is also two arenas were you can battle waves of enemies. 

[*]	You get to choose your character. Each character has different abilities, for example the soldier can deploy a turret. 

[*]	I really liked the colourful art-style; it made the game feel unique. 

[*]	The game has some cool film references. 

[*]	 The combat is fun and addictive. The guns are satisfying to use and have a good kick to them. The game is also quite challenging as well, although I did think that the boss fights were a bit too easy.   

[*]	Plenty of steam achievements, especially if you bought the game of the year. There are plenty of in-game challenges as well for extra XP. 

[*]	The game has a levelling up system which awards the player with skills points which can be spent on perks. Each enemy is levelled, so you know who you can take on and who you can't.   

[*]	I like how you have the chance to revive yourself when you die. 

[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]

[*]	Billions of weapons that looked very similar to each other. 

[*]	More vehicles to drive. Vehicles are too weak and easily get blown up by enemies. I would of liked to of seen more car combat. Racing and car customization would have been a nice addition. 

[*]	I wish you could engage in dialogue with the Npc's, instead of npc's just being there to give you quests. I also wish that the dialogue for the quests was voice acted.

[*]	Soundtrack isn't anything special. 

[*]	Would have been nice if you could customize your own weapon. 

[*]	Would have liked a mini-map instead of a compass.

[*]	The games perks weren't very interesting.  

[*]	More customization for the character. 

[*]	The story is average. 

[*]	I didn't like the idea of items being replenished every time you enter that area again. 

[*]	Would have liked more interiors to explore. Most of the game takes place outside. 
[/list]
[u]Conclusion[/u] 


I enjoyed Borderlands. The combat is fun and addictive and there is plenty to do. The art-style is unique. I wish the game had more character and vehicle customization. I also didn't like the idea of items and loot respawning. If you like games like Rage,  Fallout 3, or New Vegas then I highly recommend you  give this game ago.

2366,Boring.
2367,Borderlands Goaty
2368,"""Have you seen my Gun?"" The Game. So loud, So angry. . . . So dead."
2369,pickle brick
2370,"Pretty decent introduction to the Borderlands series. Ignore the review bombing, game is one of the best looter shooters that I’ve played ever. What you should be expecting from this game is a fifteen-ish hour long campaign, with a ton of stuff to do afterward. One of the first games for my Xbox 360, it’s just a great game to have a fun time with friends with. There’s tons of side quests and opportunities to earn lots of cool guns. I just couldn’t put this game down, when I was a kid. And I hope you have the same experience when you consider buying and playing.

"
2371,I forgot how annoying Mad Moxxi's Underdome DLC is. All other DLC is worth it. Felt weird playing Borderlands 2 then going back and playing the 1st game. Felt bulky and stiff to play. BL2 and hopefully BL3 is smooth to play.
2372,Very nice shooter in comic style. You lvl up your hero and have 3 skilltrees to choose on. That opens a lot of opportunities with each character. Story is crazy and long. You only can recommend this game and all its sequels!
2373,"I'm not really a fan of this kind of game, even more because I view it as a paid free to play mmo, but shooter. The difference is that the loot is actually very generous, way more generous than the loot from Borderlands 2.

Why I compared this game to a free to play mmo? Well, the main method of progression of the game is through quests, grinding your character to progress wont work, because to unlock new places to go, aswell as new features to make use of (ex:. shops, teleporting, car), you will need to do specific quests to unlock them, and they are unlocked behind a queue of quests.

Anyway, In this game, each character is very unique comparing one to another, and each of their skill trees has their own ""WoW!"" factor, so expanding it will most likelly make you feel way happier with the build you make on your character, without counting that differently from Borderlands 2, this game doesn't takes an eternity to level up, so your character potential can be displayed even early in the game.

Every character still has their own unique active abilities, but after a certain point in the game, you will unlock the ability of setting an elemental for your character ability to inflict on the enemies, so If you place Fire 4x on Bloodwing, for example, It will cause an explosion on the target, and cause an insane burning damage.

Also talking about the elementals, the elemental system in this game is cool and simple to understand, the more times the elemental icon has, the more powerful it is, so if you use a sniper with 4x fire element, It will cause a huge fire explosion on the target, and cause an insane burning dps. I guess that's one of the most fun parts of the game, the elementals.

There is not much to explore the game, though. If you already played it before, you know where to find loot chests, even more on the very beggining of the game, because some bandit camps doesn't have spawns until you start a certain quest. Actually, the game is very linear, and I'll tell you why, right at the beggining of the game, if you try to go out of the path lead by quests too much, you will end up entering a bandit camp with level 9~10 bandits spawning, and that may happen when you are level 2, so beware if you try to explore the game. But in my opnion, It's not worth it, unless you know where there is safe loot, of course.

Other than the linearity of the game, another problem it has is that the status scale from the levels are quite high, so facing something 2 levels or above than you will be very hard to beat, aswell as will hit you hard, but I don't remember If It gives you good exp for the fight. On other hand, if you face weak enemies, you will only receive 1 exp from it. Actually, the way weak enemies dies so fast, that isn't bad, but if the status curve wasn't so high, then there wouldn't be a need for such a practice.

The game doesn't feature Badass Ranks, instead you gain a good sum of exp from completting achievements in the game, and that exp helps. Your weapon proficience also increases with the use, so the more proficience you have with the weapon, you will gain more and more bonus status for that weapon. If you want to get more exp, you may try to kill enemies with critical hits, I guess even the loot rate increases doing so.

I kind of liked the idea of the Eridian Weapons, but the way they were implemented ends up making them more of a burden than actually a good weapon to use, because they sucks. Compared to any other weapon type in the game, the Eridian Weapon doesn't have a significant dps to make it worth using, even more since It has a overheating system. Also, Eridian Weapons are quite rare to be found, for some reason.

Well, in my opnion, this game is a lot better than Borderlands 2, even though It doesn't have some quality of life stuffs, like minimap and other things. I recommend you to try this game, and if possible, bring some friends with you. Just beware not to fight over the loot, because I guess the loot isn't individual."
2374,"low it haha;-)
"
2375,amazing
2376,"Best freaky shooter with RPG elements. Played it over 100 hours on ps3.
Many weapon variations and 4 different classes and characters to play."
2377,Plenty of fun and great for a game still in early access. Look forward to seeing much more from this game!
2378,Just replayed this 10 years after I first played it.  Still a phenominal game.
2379,iNSANE game recommand reading all the quest logs.
2380,☆☆☆
2381,"Great game, the graphics aren't the best, but I kind of adds to the feeling of the game, the story is good and the combat is smooth."
2382,excellent game put thousands of hours into all the borderlands series on ps3/ps4 before i built a gaming pc highly recommend excellent team based game play
2383,Terrible game. I don't recommend it to anyone. Total waste of money. Buy an inflatable sex doll instead. It will be better ivestment.
2384,"Used to play this with my brother on the 360.

Still fun as hell"
2385,"The Borderlands series and the Far Cry series are my favorite modern shooting game series.

I love the bazillion guns, the rpg elements mixed with a shooting game, the cel shaded graphics, the setting in the wastelands of Pandora, the crazy humor, the references/parodies, the personality of the characters, the claptraps, the enormous amount of content, and the incredible amount of fun I can have.

A game that starts with “ain’t no rest for the wicked” and ends with “no heaven” has something special to it.

Like Winston Wolfe, this game has character. Having respect for the Borderlands series gives character."
2386,"I will make this one short.

Borderlands 2 is better in every possible way. But if there was no Borderlands 1, there couldn't be Borderlands 2.

Besides that - this game is actually good. Plays differently than Borderlands 2 but still good. I suppose every Borderlands 2 or The pre-sequel player should eventually play this one too and see where it all originated (story and gameplay-wise).

Run on Linux using Proton - no issues."
2387,Graphics aren't the best but the game play makes up for it. Great fun game to play
2388,"This game is fantastic, the replayability as well as the following sequels make it the perfect start to an epic adventure"
2389,"This game is painfully mediocre in pretty much every aspect, compared to its sequel at least. The “story” is almost nonexistent and boring, the shooting is meh, there are like 10 guns recycled over and over through the whole game, the ai is stupid, the missions are boring and always the same, the color palette makes me want to die etc etc.
But even though all those problems exist, i kept grinding and grinding somehow. I wasnt particularly immersed in the world or having fun, but it kept me coming back. The grind in this game, is one of the best in all the games i played in my opinion.
I also like the dark dry humor of this game. It doesnt make you laugh like borderlands 2 but i think it fits the pandora of this game far more.

In conclusion, play the second if you havent played it yet. Play this one if you loved the second, and dont want to play it again, but keep in mind this is just an inferior version of that."
2390,Finna Catch-a-Ride?
2391,good video game.
2392,"It's alright if you're just here for the combat, but on the road it can get tediously boring

Things that could be improved:
- Less driving, more shooting
- The map size is too freaking big, unwelcoming for those that prefer to get in, kill some bad guys and get out: most of your time will be spent shooting people chasing you in vehicles (ridiculous)
- This feels too much like they forgot to add a story - oh there's this thing that we're after, better get it because, it's important
- Characters feel 2 dimensional, more cutscenes to flesh out who they are would had been nice.
- The maps look virtually the same, see one dune wasteland, seen them all
- Lack of variety in monsters
- Weapons seem to fire like nerf guns with little impact
- I'd have liked to see the combat tree worth upgrading, most of the time it just seems like a means to an end.

Best thing about this is multiplayer which is your only sole reason for purchasing it, do not solo this game expecting it to be some magnum opus"
2393,is gud
2394,Horrible. Just play BL2 or TPS
2395,hey gearbox and 2k i've recently had a problem with my saves every time i start a new character and i quit even though it says it save my character has disappeared please help starting to get annoyed
2396,This game and it's sequel are some of my favorites of all time. Hands down the best looter shooters ever made in my opinion. Fun characters and a great story.
2397,.
2398,"Not a review, just a recommendation."
2399,great game .the enhanced is a must have tho makes the game look way better
2400,Great game.
2401,"Get the remaster instead. 

why? I don't think this game aged well with its graphics"
2402,"This review is more neutral than positive. I think this game has one of the most disappointing endings of all time. Despite that, it's still a decent game but you can definitely tell that the game is a bit dated now. Borderlands 2 is better in my opinion. Fun game for a couple $ on sale. Can be a bit annoying sometimes."
2403,use brick punch bricks
2404,"good game, much fun"
2405,Super clunky FPS mechanics and the enemy level scaling is over the top. Wasn't very fun so tried Borderlands 2 which is great.
2406,epic
2407,"Super fun - fast loading, great action, great loot - best played with friends!"
2408,"Fun, worth a play."
2409,"I love this game.
Why you ask?
Because its so stupid that its good"
2410,downright best game. I played borderlands one on ps3 originally but pc play is much better.
2411,"This is the real enhanced edition, don't let the name fool you.

The government drugged your water to make you believe this isn't the enhanced edition."
2412,This Borderland fun but not pretty
2413,"The true essence of a looter shooter with no weird modern day gimmicks, preserved by time. An easy 10/10 from me."
2414,OMG OMG yang penting dapet points summer sale!
2415,A classic. I recommend this for anyone over the age of 12.
2416,One of those games you can play forever...
2417,"If you like Borderlands 2 play this, it's cheap enough."
2418,1>2>pre
2419,"It's a classical. You will (and I recommend) play it more than once, to see all the different play styles."
2420,"It might be surprising that I would recommend [i]Borderlands[/i]. It’s surprising to me. I bought this game five years ago almost [i]to the date[/i] and I have spent that entire five years periodically trying to get deep enough into it to form a coherent opinion. The repetition that always stopped me from getting very far never really went [i]away[/i], but what allowed me to see the thing through this time was that I reached a point where the shooting that comprises upwards of 90% of everything you ever do actually became fun. This happened about a third of the way into the game, when I simultaneously began to find enough passably decent weapons and started reaching some of the more exciting perks on my skill tree. At this point I was able to actually start building my character around playstyles I enjoyed. I had done it; I had broken into [i]Borderlands[/i] and started to have fun.

The rub, I guess, is that the first third of the game is fucking [i]gruelling[/i]. No wonder I hated this game for so many years - it does a terrible job at trying to get you invested. Nothing about areas like ‘Arid Badlands’, ‘Skag Gully’ or the wide and empty ‘Dahl Headland’ lets on that there’s fun coming at any point down the road. It almost seems like developer Gearbox Software has made every possible effort to try to keep you out of the perfectly enjoyable later stages of the game. Between the writing, the menus, the vehicles, the way enemies respawn more frequently than loot does so you often end up being forced to fight a bunch of guys for no reward, the respawn system that often either spawns you within the sights of the enemies that just killed you or puts you too close to a boss fight so that the boss’s health doesn’t reset, the way side missions are only handed out at certain locations but new ones only appear after you have no more reason to return to these areas, and the way quest markers wildly vary between telling you the exact location of an object you need and just showing you the rough area with no clear way to discern between the two, I couldn’t blame you for wanting to give the entire game a miss.

I think the clincher for my ultimately recommending this one is that it’s a game almost solely about shooting things, and the act of shooting things is really good. There are countless procedurally-generated weapons varying from basic shotguns and rifles to rare and bizarre alien artifacts that shoot lasers, and every one of them looks and sounds great. It’s uncommon for more recent shooters like this to be so openly devoted to the act of shooting and how it feels. [i]Borderlands[/i] is in no way about interesting level design, interesting enemy design, clever writing, or interesting missions, so if clicking on people and having exciting colors and horrible screams overwhelm your senses is not your idea of a good time, then all the things I’ve already mentioned will make this game no longer worth playing. All I know is that I became very invested in the stats of my magical wizard lady and the pieces of technology she could kill people with, and that I really enjoyed switching my brain off and clicking on people for hours on end, so I guess you could call this my most tentative recommendation ever, but I recommend [i]Borderlands[/i] nonetheless.

2421,"the game is fun,easy,and cool get this game if you want to have a good time"
2422,"Absolute classic! Awesome gameplay, great story, and specific humor. You have to try it - trust me - it is worth it!"
2423,Outdated badly.
2424,"Awesome game, can't wait for Borderlands 3"
2425,really fun
2426,This game is a fun adventure styled action FPS. You get to assign traits to your character RPG style so it has some customization for how you play. Lots to do and never boring. Get it on sale and play for hours.
2427,Many years after the release it still brings countless hours of joy and entertainment. Been playing it with full team and have enjoyed every step through Pandora for the 4th time!
2428,The of the best and funnest games with single player and co-op.
2429,Very good game. Love it!
2430,"Everybody likes Borderlands, but I don't. I don't connect with its sense of humour, the story is poor and not well told, and I feel doing the same over and over again."
2431,Good for killing cockroaches and insects :)
2432,good game
2433,Brilliant.
2434,Great co-op game
2435,is preeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeety gooooooood
2436,"Completely enjoyed it with all the DLC from it. As an achievement nut who likes getting as many as I can, missing out on co-op related ones does suck, but overall, the game is fantastic."
2437,This game is very good. Not as good as Borderlands 2 and not bad in comparison to Borderlands the Pre-Sequel. Will make you rage if you do not level your character with side quests tho so you gots to do those before story missions. This game is a must play if you can handle 2008 graphics.
2438,yes
2439,Wow very cool.
2440,"A great FPS experience with strong RPG mechanics offers players a customized experience based on preferred play style, with the option to choose between a solo play experience or a co-op experience with up to four simultaneous players through internet connection. The game offers a campaign full of content, with each progressive location offering both story progressing and optional offered objectives for the player to complete for varying rewards, from in game currency used for purchasing upgrades to maximum ammo capacity for each of the different weapon types to randomly generated equipment and weapons offered by the many in game vending machines. Level up your chosen character and progress towards your ultimate goal: locating the rumored legendary Vault hidden somewhere on the alien planet where you begin as a fledgling vault hunter, and claim its reward for your own."
2441,nice.
2442,"Great Game, however I personally cannot recommend. Field of View + Frame Rate makes me nauseus."
2443,dobra gierka ugułem
2444,"Shoot. Loot. Laugh. Game is old enough that controls might feel wonky, but that is what settings are for. Borderlands 2 the dlc to this game is fun. No one can say they are a true Borderlands fan until they have survived the claptrap revolution. Viva la Resistance!"
2445,"If you're one of the few that doesn't have this already go ahead and pick it up in the sale or with the handsome pack. Fantastic game, fun DLC, better with friends but dropping in with a rando can be fun but try not to go with someone too far from your level or your task list will be jammed with stuff you can't get to for a while."
2446,Aged incredibly well. A must play for fans of the genre.
2447,"It's like Diablo, but with guns. Lots and lots of gun."
2448,"I will just leave a simple review ... If you like FPS games,dark humor and killing anything that moves you just have to play this game .. I freaking love it .. 10/10!"
2449,garbo
2450,gooder
2451,Good game. Shit ending.
2452,Amazing game to play with the right company. Definitely recommend playing with someone than running through solo. I also recommend not waiting to do Mad Moxxi's Arena in the order the DLC was released. Being level 40 + and doing the longer tournaments is rather painful. Good luck with your looting. Spiderants and Defilers are also a pain. Toodles.
2453,One of the few games I've played through more than once.
2454,"The game have hours of fun!
The only bad thing there is to say about this game is that the Co-op have massive lag!"
2455,"Guns lots of guns! Shooting, blowing up, death buggy, and PSYCHOS!"
2456,"Great game, great series."
2457,"Fun but grindy and difficult, in order to have fun you gotta do the sidequests and you cant easily finish the main storyline without the sidequests and bounties."
2458,"Sick game.
So fun with friends."
2459,Still this many years later it's one of my favorite games to play through. Now I'm playing it with my kid and it's just as awesome to hear her giggle as she taking out midget shotgunners.
2460,"Great Game. This was the start of a great series, and the sequels have only improved."
2461,clap trap? more like imma about to clap his cheeks
2462,Video Game Crack
2463,It's worth checking it out. The combat and mechanics are quite nice. The graphics are unique. The only flaw I find is that all the sections of the game looks the same.
2464,"revolutionary game, simply amazing"
2465,Great Game. GOTY only enhances it.
2466,"Very good game, especially fun with friends"
2467,still relevant
2468,G(old)
2469,fun game
2470,Good!
2471,also yes
2472,Cool Game
2473,Fun game
2474,This is the first game I have got on Steam. And I've never regret about this.
2475,"Nauseous and blurry graphics hurt your eyes and make this trash game unplayable.

Unbelievable how stupid a developer can be to actually release such a garbage product.

Speaking of graphics.
Every shade of brown you can think of is in there, from light all the way up to a little darker brown. Brown is everywhere.
I guess this is the color of dev's favourite food. As they try to feed consumers with it.
Maps are ugly. All the objects and props merge into one pile of trash.

They released a new remastered version. Although it didn't change anything.

The ""Borderlands Game of the Year Enhanced"" edition is a buggy mess with audio issues, framerate issues, non-existent enemies popping in and out, and worst of all shooting and aiming will stop working occasionally. Be prepared for stuttering sound and FPS drops.

Gameplay.

The gameplay is severely unbalanced. And tedious. And poor. And garbage.

Fetch and return missions is the core activity in this game.

The game gives you a pitifully disorganized mess of an inventory system to deal with.
You go through lots of looting and micromanaging.
It's easy to fall into the familiar grind of stopping every few minutes to check the gun you just found against the guns you already possess to see if there is a possibility for a small incremental upgrade. While this type of gameplay is inherent to many loot games, this game's poor systems slow this whole experience to an insufferable crawl.

Your powerful weapons are weak because enemies are higher level then you.
What is the point of having so many weapons then?

Incredibly tiny variation in enemy types:
Human, Big Human, Tiny Human, Crazy Human.
Dog, Big Dog, Tiny Dog, Crazy Dog.

Field of view is terrible.

Frame rate is terrible

Hitboxes are terrible.

The sniper rifle doesn't crit even when you aimed directly at someone's skull. 
Same goes with every weapon.

Story.

There is no story. 
Ending is ridiculously bad and forgettable.

There is nothing enjoyable about this game."
2476,"Classic looter shooter, many things were improved in 2, but this one still has enough charm and fun."
2477,Rather old but its still got it
2478,"its good 
"
2479,"Silly, repetitive, childish and boring even when played with friends."
2480,One of my favorite games of all time. 11/10.
2481,i love this damn game i swear i can play it for hours
2482,This is a good game.
2483,Everything just works.
2484,;)
2485,11/10 lilith is way to overpowered.
2486,One of the best games to come back too almost in 10 years!
2487,it gud
2488,"The combat, the story and the loot makes this game really fun."
2489,Great
2490,...
2491,wow very nice
2492,Amzing love it so much!
2493,Brings back the memories.
2494,The title that started the Shoot & Loot 4 player Co-op trend in gaming.
2495,This game is still one of the best FPS out there.
2496,Better than Boderlands 2 and that other one in space.
2497,"A great start to a franchise. It is fun, though the controls are a bit clunky. I have found it easier to play with a controller, but I wish the ""game pad"" mode carried over to tell your which game pad buttons are which keyboard keys. Otherwise, great game! Fun twist!"
2498,pew
2499,"While this game tends to be overshadowed by its younger brother, the original Borderlands still holds up impressively well. In some areas, especially balancing, this game outperforms later iterations. While with the advent of a new dlc, Borderlands 2 is taking the lions share of the limelight, it was still nice of Gearbox to give us the GOTY edition of the original, especially for those with slightly less [i]impressive[/i] Pcs.

All in all, good game. 8/10"
2500,"very good
"
2501,amazin
2502,I met nice guy thanks to this game. Thanks and yeah coop is very great and funny
2503,10/10 yeet
2504,great game
2505,BEST GAME OF ALL THE CENTURY
2506,BOPPITY BOOPITY THEY MADE IT WORSE THAN THE ORIGINAL SOMEHOW LITERALLY
2507,"Probably one of the most replayable/chill shooters of its time. An instant damned classic, honestly."
2508,nice
2509,A classic that has unlimited replay value. A must own for any library.
2510,"This is easily one of my favorite games of all time. The characters are memorable, the loot is randomized and plentiful, and the the gameplay is extremely varied. I've recently picked it up again to try out co-op, and it's amazingly decent for its age. It also runs on older computers, despite looking really good. Highly recommend for both the solo and the co-op play."
2511,"Are you big fan of Borderlands? Really love looter shooter or maybe FPS with RPG? IF YES, BUY THIS GAME."
2512,"pretty cool to get, it's pretty much just updated graphics and a gold chest that justifies a worse grinder"
2513,good
2514,One of the best first person shooters to come along in a long time can be played over and over with different abilities and weapons
2515,"This runs better than the remaster, how surprising"
2516,a bit deserted but still ok in single
2517,pretty alright but no windowed mode
2518,"borderlands is a very soild game and a good first attempt by gearbox at the looter shooter genre. it may not look good visually or have an fov slider but it is enjoyable if you like this kind of game. One catch to watch out for is that the missions are quite genric and repetitive. there were a few types of misions where it had a basic premise with a little deviation here or there. fetch quests, kill quest, 2 or three arenas that are extremely hard and kinda frustrating because of movement and dificulty. i did get very close to being bored during the main story becuase of the boring msiion layout and the not too interesting story but this was always mended by the writing. the characters and dialogue are great and really carry the game and so mi encourage you to read mission descriptions (before and after) and listen to character dialogue. the writing really carries this game. the dlc is fun its just that you should be careful of the order you play them and be aware they really padded them out. they may be funny and cool but i stopped after barely complete general knoxx as i was extremely tired of the game"
2519,It's a pretty dang good game. If you like big ol looter shooters with biog ol guns you'll love it.
2520,"Tight game but a real dick move from fucking Randy, removing the original and forcing people to pay 30 bucks for a 10-year old game. If you can get it outside of Steam, do it."
2521,10/10 happy toms
2522,"I really like the game, but I couldn’t find the stupid cake."
2523,"A solid shooter with a fun story, and light sense of humor. The original that started the franchise."
2524,"Brilliant game. Whilst playing single player does slightly lower the enjoyment of this game, it's still a fun experience which still holds up years after its release."
2525,"If i had to choose just one game to play for the rest of eternity, i'd choose Borderlands. It's endless (literally) fun and an entertaining spectacle all the way to finish line (which pretty much becomes a starting line with NewGame+). Best shoot & loot the gaming world has to offer."
2526,Still a Great game
2527,"Only if you like to grind or want to play with friends.
BTW, sometimes funny humor here and there."
2528,Classic
2529,The joy of funny cartoon violence.
2530,Lots of fun!
2531,"Old, but gold!"
2532,fun game innit
2533,best game ever
2534,Amazing Game
2535,Still one of my favourite game of all time.
2536,i like this game because its fun and entertaning
2537,If you've already played BL2 don't bother with this one
2538,"100% on 360, where it all began. Some problems with end level balance.

Best with friends."
2539,.
2540,Love this game very much
2541,"i spent an hour or two into it 
its good"
2542,Timeless classic that is always fun top play. A steal when on sale for the complete series. Worth double the price!
2543,very good remaster
2544,gg
2545,oooooooooo
2546,"Still holds up as of 2019. Play by yourself or, better yet, with 3 mates."
2547,"Awesome game for casual evenings with your friends. Suitable even for newbies in FPS genre. The fact that multiplayer game is the same as Singleplayer, just with stronger enemies makes it really easy to catch up, especially if you want to play with some of your friends you can just catch up playing in singleplayer.

With discount, it's a no-brainer purchase ;)"
2548,"Good game.  I've played all the other version and wanted to play this one before 3 is released in the fall. Pretty good for a 10 year old game system, very good story."
2549,Sniper rifles are gau
2550,"Best line in the game ""MEAT! MEAT! MEAT! MEAAAAT!"" 10/10, he likes meat"
2551,"Great FPS. Unique graphic style, good humour from NPC's and enough weapons/enemies to keep you interested."
2552,Fun as hell and plenty of loot.
2553,"Classic, classic. One of the best FPS RPG's."
2554,"This game always reminds me of fond memories, and i always will love it for that.
Great start for one of the great franchises.
Highly recommended."
2555,If you have some money to spare this is a good purchase to go with; a good 20-25 hours experience and a good time all around.
2556,This goes without saying but BL1 is so amazing and I hope Baha is resting nice. #RIP
2557,"90+ FOV is for P L E B S. 
"
2558,classic
2559,"yee yee

*better than BL2"
2560,only ogs remember this game
2561,Do not play this game with friends. They will take all your gear and sheckles.
2562,"FPS Diablo, I mean, Borderlands is the first non-Action R.P.G. in the Loot Collector Simulator genre. It is a refreshing take on a genre that started to stale in both art style and game play. Anyone who likes themself should buy this and all the sequels, prequels, spin-offs, and knockoffs of this game!!!"
2563,Very fun!
2564,Super fun.
2565,A fun classic.
2566,It good.
2567,"Before Destiny, Before The Division, the one and only true looter shooter.  Huge open maps. Co-op game play. Cell shaded graphics that are timeless. And more guns than you can shake a skag limb at.  You can't go wrong picking this game up."
2568,"my current go-to shooter at the moment. 

i have the rest of the series ( as of this post [ eww, epic. really?] ) and intend to play them. but being a offline game, i'm in no extreme rush to do so. i'm just absorbing how the series plays out being as how i've never played any part of the series."
2569,awesome game. good story lots to do.
2570,Cant go wrong with the classic!
2571,It's Good
2572,cool and good
2573,"I can say the n-word and it has no repercussions unlike my real life job. 


10/10 would eat again"
2574,"Ah, Borderlands. People either love it or hate it. The first game is definitely rough around the edges, but it's also got a certain charm that keeps bringing me back to it. I honestly have no idea how many times I've played through this game, between multiple playthroughs with every character across the different console versions and two separate Steam accounts. 

BL2 is certainly more refined, but I honestly prefer the original. The ""enhanced"" version is garbage, though. Avoid that one like the plague until they sort it out (if Blind Squirrel and/or Gearbox ever actually bother to patch it up)."
2575,One of the best looter shooters in existence.
2576,"My all time waster game of all time, love this game till the day I die"
2577,Place Holder Review
2578,Gitgud
2579,Love this game
2580,Good Game except for the remastered edition way to buggy
2581,Not really worth it. Just play borderlands 2.
2582,An oldie but still fun game
2583,"Just fun , buy it"
2584,"Worth ruining your life over the sweet loot you get from this game, you just can't get enough"
2585,"Played with two friends, but got bored and stopped playing. Don't remember anything outstandingly good. Gunplay was okay. Too many guns that basically do the same thing, lots of looting and micromanaging, if you're into that. I wasn't. My Mates weren't. So we moved on. Others seem to like it much better, so maybe we're the problem. Just didn't find find any reason to prefer this game to some of the other 500 Games in my Library."
2586,"Really fun game, great for those who appreciate a grind. Fun gameplay, unique weapons, cool abilities, and rewarding progression system."
2587,love
2588,very good
2589,Watchoo want!?
2590,"I'm not very good at FPS game, but I had a lot of fun playing this with my boyfriend. The story is great! I love the vice acting and character design."
2591,great classic
2592,"Love this game, i have it on ps3, ps4 and now steam"
2593,"Borderlands best game, would buy again"
2594,frickin amazing
2595,AMAZEBASLLS
2596,"The one that started it all and it still holds up very well. The highly addictive looter/shooter gameplay loop more than makes up for the somewhat lackluster story, quite a few rough edges and a severe case of universal brownness. 

All in all still an amazing game 10 years later. Definitely recommended."
2597,A classic game. It is enjoyable to figure out which guns are better then other guns.
2598,"My favorite game, I have been playing borderlands games since i was in middle school. 
Now I'm 21 and looking forward to Borderlands 3 like never before."
2599,yay
2600,"After years of enjoying the other games in the series, I decided it was worth playing the first in the series. It holds up nicely! There's a few issues here and there but that's to be expected given it's age (And they're now solved in the re-release if that's more your preference). Though the series has advanced in all aspects in my opinion, it's still worth a playthrough.

The classic borderlands experience with the ridiculous Borderands humour and gameplay the series is known for."
2601,classic
2602,It can be a challenge at times but this is a very rewarding and fun game.
2603,Old but gold
2604,GOTY
2605,"Genre-defining first person looter-shooter RPG with a great progression system, very good co-op mechanics, funny characters and an interesting storyline. I know that the second game is the most successful entry of the series (at least to date), but my favourite will always be this one. Definitely recommended."
2606,A good Co-op game to play.
2607,"Great game with good humour. Impossibly steep learning curve regarding weapons, shields, etc, with way too many variations. (Wiki's are your friend!) It can get very, very, very, grindy if you let it. For example, each of the four classes needs to be leveled up independently, requiring 2+ playthroughs for each. I'm only playing singleplayer, so I resorted to modding save files to try out the different classes. Your mileage my vary.

At its heart it is a loot hunting game. It is also one in which loot is entirely dependant on RNG, which can be incredibly frustrating at times. But if that is your thing, then you will enjoy this game."
2608,Good on collecting guns
2609,"If anyone is playing mutliplayer and needs to fix the lag 2 things, Lock the frame rate to 60hz on both people playing with vsync on. Then there is a ini edit that removes the voice feature in the game, the Voice packets even when disabled in game cause huge desync issues.

Go into your BL Enhanced Config folder Documents\My Games\Borderlands Game of the Year\WillowGame\Config
open Willowengine.ini (with notepad etc) and use the search function (CTRL F)
search for bHasVoiceEnabled=True
Replace ""True"" with False
Save file
Rightclick willowengine.ini open properties
Make it read only (near the bottom under attributes)

You will get a notification when you launch but you can hit back and go right into the game, its 100% worth, the lag and desync almost completely disappears"
2610,"Very good game
"
2611,One of the best story driven RPG games.
2612,10/10

2614, Good game
2615,Pretty cool.
2616,<3 Want Borderlands 3 on steam :/
2617,WHAAAAA
2618,"I enjoyed the silliness of the game.  But, after a while it felt repetitive.  Go here fetch this and return it to me.  Over and over.  The shooting wasn't strategic.  Just mindless shoot the oncoming hoards until they're all gone.  I will say the game looked great and I never experienced a crash.  I'm looking forward to Borderlands 2 before 3 comes out.  It's worth your time and money."
2619,"Pretty fun, although sometimes it gets very repetitive."
2620,"very good
"
2621,"I love this game so much. Its funny, crazy and just so fun! I like how the game has graphics that look like they are from a comic book. I played Tales from the Borderlands (a Telltale game) and I loved that, so, I decided to start playing the franchise. I don't usually play FPS games, but, this one is awesome. A++"
2622,"Good old fashioned co-op fun. Perfect LAN party material. Sequels improve on it, sure, but the original has a certain feel that can't be matched or set aside. 10/10"
2623,"What can i say that hasn't already been said? Borderlands GOTY looks great! A fresh coat of paint really did wonders and playing the first has been great. But in all honesty, I'm just writing this for the summer sales grand prix. lol"
2624,"Fun shooter with a ton of content, however the enemies quickly become bullet sponges"
2625,"I LIKE MY ENEMIES HOW I LIKE MY COFFEE, IN THE BUTT"
2626,i like borderlands
2627,great game
2628,I'm writing this review for the summer steam event. Most likely you already know what this game is.
2629,Good memes
2630,Still a fun game after all these years
2631,very good :)
2632,Good Loot n Shoot game.
2633,10/10 would grind again
2634,it's great
2635,"Usually I'm not that into shooting games because I don't really feel like I'm getting any stronger in the game and the weapons themselves don't get any stronger either.  However, with borderlands you can level your character and the weapons themselves have different stats and rarity so that even though you use the same type of weapon you are dealing more damage rather than picking up a gun on the first level and the last level and their being no difference between the two like other shooters."
2636,Skvělý
2637,Classic game. Best played with friends. The story antics are funny. The gameplay is just right. The randomness of the weapons adds to the enjoyment.
2638,Still the best game after these years! Better with remastered graphics and DLC! WUB WUB WUB!
2639,Uff nice
2640,more like borederlandssssss
2641,nice!
2642,Borderland is Borderline great!
2643,So nice played it twice... Maybe 4 times... Ok maybe 8 times.
2644,Its ok
2645,fun game.
2646,"Very enjoying and addictive gameplay, lots of fun grinding for better guns and equipment, great story with a cast of colorful characters that will keep you interested in the story. 9/10"
2647,"Its borderlands 1 but with some QOL improvements
"
2648,AWESOME GAME!!
2649,gud
2650,9/10
2651,Such a brilliant remastered.
2652,"Man, I love this game. It's still my favorite Borderlands in the franchise, despite the fact that most people consider it a distant second to BL2.

This game has *atmosphere*. It has a sense of mystery, discovery, and exploration that BL2 really does not, and I value that.

I also enjoy the gunplay in BL1 more than BL2. I feel like BL1's weapon design fell right into a sweet spot for me. As a veteran FPS gamer, it was easy to find guns in BL1 that fit my preferred playstyle- HIGH accuracy, good damage, managable recoil. BL2 changed around the manufacturers to make them feel more distinct from each other, but the result is that over 50% of the guns in the game feel unusable to me."
2653,"Honestly, it's one of the most intuitive FPS that I've played in years. Great for bite-sized little packages of carnage or for lengthy bouts of obsessive looting and still well worth a run-through or five before Borderlands 3 hits us."
2654,Boring
2655,Yes.
2656,Fun & Entertaining. Enjoyed the action. Great for Co-Op.
2657,"Fantastic game, played after BL2 and thoroughly enjoyed!"
2658,nice
2659,11/10 would play again
2660,GG
2661,"All I can write is that people are angry about Epic Game Store buying exclusivity rights to Borderlands 3 and review bombing the current Borderlands games. I want to say I would thank GearBox Software for giving me a free remaster of Borderlands GOTY edition, for making a great series, but no thanks to Randy Pitchford for giving exclusivity rights to Epic Games Store. I will be writing a better review in the future when I fully finish the game.
"
2662,One of the best games to play with your friends
2663,Good !
2664,Nice
2665,Still one of the best shooter RPG hybrids (somehow called looter shooters now) today.
2666,Fantastic game!

A very witty and special kind of humor merged into a shoot and loot mechanic. The main story is a bit short and shallow, and most quests are just from 1 point on the map to the other so the majority of time spend will be just getting around. If you are looking to 100% the game like me it will quickly become boring since it's just more of the same throughout the whole game. There are a few glitches and room for improvement, but the game has a good formula which is improved in the sequels and you can enjoy with friends."
2672,iz gud gayme!

2678,"Even ten years after its original release, Borderlands is still a great experience."
2679,A true classic! <3
2680,"good game, worth the price"
2681,"A little rough around the edges compared to later titles in the franchise, but this is the one that started it all. Well worth a playthrough to gain a feel for the characters and story of the borderlands universe."
2682,This game is awesome!!
2683,Very good game for solo and coop
2684,<3
2685,"Certainly was a fun game to play before playing borderlands 2, I did have some issues with field of view that required some tinkering in the settings, because there wasn't an option for in the game itself, but appart from that.

Really a must play for people to get in the borderlands series, but I wouldn't recommend the Moxie DLC. That was just boring, the rest is good tough."
2686,"
its a good game

2687,Doing this for Summer Sale. Will add an actual Review later. Great game by the way.

2689,"I'm not that much into shooters, but boy do I enjoy blowing faces off when I'm in the mood. Oh, you know which ""mood"" I'm talking about. I enjoyed playing it alone and I trust it gets funnier with friends . Have my thumbs up."
2690,Not bad!
2691,Good game
2692,Still a fun game a decade later. It does get a bit grindy though.
2693,"Gudo, but not so Gudo than BL2."

2698,Love this game
2699,I died more than I killed enemies.
2700,A shoot-n-loot FPS RPG-lite with class based gameplay and 4 player co-op. It's a good time with friends or without!
2701,ok

2704,Good
2705,"Pew pew, collect loot. If graphics are a problem, try to enhanced version"
2706,"Awesome game, loads of content that you can play."

It may be old but you know what they say, ""Old is Gold"""

2711,great an instant classic
2712,👍
2713,i think its ok

2719,yea its pretty good. definitely underrated compared to bl2. if you can get it on sale def worth the price
2720,10/10
2721,I've played through this with a couple friends over the years. It is a fun looter shooter. Simple and mindless for the most part. The sequel adds a lot more story elements if you want more. Worth playing through if you plan to play the series.
2722,"This is one of the first FPS titles that I played when I started gaming. I recommend it and the rest of the series to anyone that I talk games with. If  you have never had a chance to play this game I would pick it up and try it. The game play is good, the story is fun, and it has replay value if you are the kind that like to try the different classes on offer.

I believe that I got this game for free because I owned the others. However, I did own it and all the DLC on the Xbox 360 when it all first came out."
2723,too violent
2724,i played mordecai.
2725,"Level scaling really hurts the overall usefulness of the guns you find which is sad. 
 The many old time engine issues in this version make it not recommendable compared to the enhanced edition , which itself still has many bugs which make it a choir"
2726,7.0 / 10
2727,"this is THE best game, it has everything"
2728,"Love the game, but re the continuation of the series on Epic: go fuck yourselves Epic"
2729,"cant use shift codes unless you run the ENHANCED version of GOTY , GEAR BOX CAN SUCK IT < MAKING PEOPLE HAVE TO RUN ENHANCED VERSION JUST TO USE SHIFT CODES <  GEAR BOX YOU SUCK !!!!!!!!!!!!!



Otherwise freaking good game although 2 is better by far , pre is worse then 1 , and the tale tell one was a great story enjoyed it very much."
2730,Huge Borderlands Franchise fan!
2731,"[h1]Borderline R.e.t.a.r.d.e.d[/h1]

A first-person, fast-paced, open-word, action oriented shooter with shallow RPG elements thrown in. A complete disaster on all counts (and then some).

Gonna start with the most prevalent and annoying thing of all - the gunplay. You ever played roulette? Well then you played Borderlands. A completely chance based, cone-shaped bullet spray. All guns, all types. Doesn't even matter. Your cone can be covered 100% by the enemy and still miss half of the time. Be it the very first bullet you fire or the one in the middle of recoil hell - it's all complete RNG where the bullets hit. Way to design a FPS game. At least it works both ways and enemy is affected by it too. Except their grenades - they work with [i]Worms[/i] like precision!
Forget shooting anything over 50 meters, it's a waste of bullets. Forget shooting over 100 meters, enemy does not spawn above that distance. But wait, surely the Sniper works as intended right? Sure it works half of the time if under 50m. Sniper serves (as do all weapons for that matter) as an early warning system for enemies for all to converge on your position where everyone knows your hidey-hole position instantly.

Btw, you are lucky if the enemies are pre-placed so you can engage at distance (lel). This only happens on the first pass through an area. Once cleared and you backtrack after some +10 minutes the area will still be empty but here is the kicker - they'll now respawn when you are right in the middle of it. This isn't RNG based but happens 100% of the time instead. Enemy respawn mechanic is the dumbest thing I ever saw. Enjoy using your wheel of fortune roulette to clear them out every single time.

Story can be summed up into a single paragraph. Spread out into tiny bits so far apart you'll forget what little breadcrumb was laid out to you few hours ago. Not that it matters that much as even '93 Doom had more complex story (I sheit you not). Story is further padded out by swarm of endless ""fetch quests"" via faceless bulletin text-boards or occasionally by 1-dimensional and forgettable NPC characters. Character's motivation is presented in such a shallow simplified way I had to rely on my achievements brain cancer inducing crave to finish this pile of turd.

RPG elements are an insult to the genre. Basically you add skill points for higher damage, damage resistance, accuracy (tnx God), health, and so on. It doesn't change gameplay style whatsoever and I'll tell you why. Because as you get stronger so do enemies. The same tedious trench warfare where you chip away enemy healths (with every 5th bullet mind you) repeats until the end. But the higher the level the more bullet-spongy enemies become and more hits it takes to bring them down. Because RNG loot can't catch up with the damage demand...

Which brings the to loot based progression bullcrap. Even with millions of different guns (ye right) in this game it only means it will be that much harder to get what you desperately need. Visually, each type of weapon is divided into several sectors and game randomizes their appearance out of fixed pool so they only appear different. In reality they exhibit the same behavior. Add to that randomized colors and you have enough to fool countless kiddos who think this is teh best game evah. The same hype that fooled me into starting this POS 10 years later. Even two completely different types of weapons: e.g. pistol and rifle, behave essentially the same. In damage, accuracy, magazine size, etc. In fact, more often than not the pistols have better stats. For example I completely abandoned rifles and use a pistol, even though my character is rifle oriented...

Weapons stats are pulled out of a pool of about ~15 different ones, maximum of 5 which can be attributed to a single weapon. So as in my case it's the RNG loot that dictates your play style rather than yourself. Stats as +damage, -recoil, +magazine size, +accuracy, +elemental damage, etc... The variety is such that you will practically never get what you want. There are shops but the assortment lags behind several levels so it mostly useless save once in a blue moon where a truly nice weapon is offered for which you'll never have enough cash. I'm talking manually picking up 5k pieces of cash loot units before having enough. Can be offset somewhat by quest rewards and selling weapons but it's still a small chance you'll have enough at the right time.

Inventory and the whole UI is very basic and a chore to navigate. Mouse wheel doesn't work in menus which is very annoying while scrolling through mission briefs... you are forced to use Pg Up/Down keys. All items are clustered together in one large text list (a la Skyrim) so you'll spend enormous time carefully trying not to accidentally sell the good stuff, constantly inspecting stats of each individual item.

Game has some weird cell-shading with black outline graphical gimmick that was one of the game's selling points. Well I turned it off after the first session and the game not only looks better but also improves visual enemy and loot container acquisition. Talk about form over function. You can find the config tool that makes the modification trivial on [url=https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Borderlands#Mods]PCGW[/url], but it is useful for few other things.

The ""world"" in open world the game claims to be is a bit generous as it's 99% empty space likely built by some kind of computer algorithm. It is huge I'll give it that, but it's also split into nearly 40 separate smaller sections (still fairly large, 5 mins sprint on foot side-to-side) with loading screens, reducing that open world feel. Year older Fallout 3 did this much better for example. Because of the samey nature of the world it's not easy to distinguish one area from another or orient yourself. The map UI, being very rough in presentation, does not help either. Takes about 5 sections until you get access to a vehicle which is a Godsend at that point (mostly to avoid fights and to 1-shoot roadkill anything). But still even with a car it gets tedious and time consuming to traverse questionably connected ever increasing number of sections but you'll have to do it until you activate fast travel after 10 of them. Btw, I suspect there was a stamina mechanic in the game code at one point but I am thankful it didn't make the cut.

Savegame is check-point based and only one slot is permitted per playthrough. So the worst of the worst, what did I expect. There are some fake checkpoints after which you will exit the game to take a rest of the dumbness only to discover the real save was an hour earlier and you'll have to RNG-kill those 100 bullet sponges all over again. Funny thing is those fake saves did save your ammo count so you wasted that too. Eventually you'll learn which is which...

[b]DLC[/b]
The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned - good, melee/short range enemies only, nice story
Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot - cures cancer by giving your cancers cancer and killing them before they kill you bad
The Secret Armory of General Knoxx - so-so, slightly better story than base game
Claptrap's New Robot Revolution - DLC for under 10 year olds

All four lack fast travel and vehicle in only present in 3rd, but distances are so huge it practically doesn't matter. You'll soon start using exit game / load trick to bypass 10 minute backtracks as you spawn in the Hub checkpoint to finish your quests. Top mechanic Randy.

* * *

A brainless and pointless arcade shooter, to be played on a couch by people who never played a FPS before or more than 10 games in their life. I fell for it and am now stuck with a juicy 100-hour sinkhole (at least) until the damn achievs are done. The game thumbnail illustrates well what I wanna do to myself after 30 hours it took me to complete Playthrough 1. There are 2 in fact, if you aim reaching max level - both identical but with enemies and loot scaled up to your current level. TF have I gotten myself into?"
2732,Very dated shoot-em-up rpg. Is a very awkward and clunky experience that lacks the flow and energy of later titles in the series. I would recommend just playing the Pre-Sequel or Borderlands 2 instead as they are much better experiences.
2733,"Not many people know this, but Borderlands 1 actually came out after Borderlands 2, and it takes place in an alternate universe where everything is shit and bad and awful and garbage. Its one of those games where the entire game was designed around the world it takes place in, and thats why the gunplay feels like ass, and the graphics are bad even for a 10 year old game. All of the environments are either garbage dumps or gray deserts and its very depressing, as was intended, of course. The soundtrack sounds like that awful basement music from Resident Evil 1, except its every track in the game. Overall, just great work from the masterminds at Gearbox."
2734,boring as fuck
2735,Its just too boring. There's no story at all. Borderlands 2 > Borderlands. Borderlands is garbage
2736,I PLAYED THE ENHANCED EDITION SO I KNOW THAT THIS GAME IS GOOD EVEN IF IT SAYS I PLAYED 2 HOURS GREAT GAME 8/10
2737,"Absolutely amazing experience of looter-shooter.
Having so much with with a buddy of mine, can't even describe it. And I was told the second part is even better and all ways. Lets hope 3rd one won't disappoint!
The story is chaotic, full Mad Max style apocalyptic world to explore and shoot EVERYTHING and loot their corpses and chests. Muhahahah>:D
Fell in love with Patricia<3 her story is very interesting and she's just lovely.
Really needed this kind of anarchy atm in my life, game helps you to relax and actually just have fun. 
Recommend this to all FPS lovers too, so much fun
So what are you waiting for?
Go loot'n'shoot your way through Pandora!"
2738,REALLY dissapointed  i wanted this game to be good its one of the coolest looking games of all time but it being cool looking is pretty much the only good things about it not much story most of the time you dont even know whats going on mostly just run here shoot that
2739,GREAT
2740,"From What I have played of it.. It's fun. Yet this game WILL NOT SAVE. I have searched the forums, and done so much to try.  Created folders, edited launch state etc.  Honestly, it is not worth. It's not my job to.  I have a Lenovo Legion Y520, and no game: not Borderlands 2 or the pre-sequel, OG Bioshock, Bully, or any other game on steam or other launchers has given me this problem.  It's not my job to try and fix this issue.  Now, if you receive this product for free, try it out.  It's probably great. if not don't buy the GOTY edition or the enhanced. A real shame."
2741,"Bloodwing, my main man."
2742,"in borderlan you are forced to befriend a weird funy robot with very annoying voice and now you die?,,,,,,,,,,, thanks hyPERION

2743,Bought it only for the intro.
2744,hella nice
2745,"Jesus Christ. I almost lost my ability to breath due to the LONG intro that you ABSOLUTELY must see and can't skip.

That said, I originally thought this game was going to be like Fallout 3 and I was quite geared up to play it. The intro was great and a pretty neat way of introducing you to the game. (Since I was obligued to see it) However it all fell apart as soon as I stepped off the bus (stepping off the bus gives you your first control of the player in the beginning of the game.) The game itself feels like every other shooter. Graphics are rather good and the art style is neat. The sound effects are pretty good, and I love how they introduce the characters. There has been quite a bit of thought into the characters and their personalities which makes the world a very interesting one to explore. 7/10 because it's a great game, though repetitive (I hate infinite respawn). I had fun, but it didn't really impress me."
2746,this version doesn't support the advertised split-screen.
2747,game nice
2748,pretty neato
2749,"Back after 2 years and still a real gem. Lucky a friend @Bo showed me the basics in Borderlands 2, or else I would have wandered off into the abyss"
2750,"Well, I don't know. I have a bad habit of finishing the games just for the sake of finishing. Borderlands is fan for the first few hours. But then, well. The story is a bit dull, the gameplay utterly repetetive and the weapon and stuff drops not really that interesting to push you forward. And also, I did all the side missions, so the final part of the game was a bit easy for me. Not just a walk in the park, but still. it gets boring really fast, and luckily for the game I am ill, so I had the time. But I HAVE TO SAY I did it all in single player, I believe that this FPS diablo-like gameplay has to be amazing when in co-op with a friend. I do recommend it, but if you're looking for an interesting gameplay and story, these aren't the psychos you're looking for. Move along"
2751,Wow! A pretty awesome game.

Borderlands is the original loot-shooter. With four playable classes, hundreds (if not thousands) of guns, and plenty of enemies to shoot at, this game spawned a franchise that is still going strong. In addition, there is a remastered version of this game out now that, despite its bugs, enhances the game drastically."
2757,"One of my favorite fps games of all time good story, good characters, and lots of weapons to choose and llove the comicbook looking graphics and textures on the game..."
2758,"VIVA FREE PANDORA, VIVA VA ROBOLUTION!"
2759,its ok
2760,"Just played all 3 Borderlands games start to finish, and all I can say is...this is one of the best games of all time. My recommendation is: Must Own."
2761,it gud
2762,Its Pretty Good
2763,"Borderlands, in its entirety, is a disappointment.  I wish I could say I love the game, but I do not even like it.

What led to this very review was a coworker praising this game for its artwork and its addictive gameplay and loot system.  This got me hooked again into wanting to revisit the title after so many years.  made me decide to revisit the title again after not looking at it for years.

Since Borderlands is easily recognizable for its comic like art, I will start there. It is that something different, that something that sets it apart from the rest. However, while I enjoy the thick lines and all, it seems that the developers were low on budget because they could not afford anything but brown. Maybe, because deep down, they knew they were making a turd of a game. Yes, it's a wasteland-esque game but that does not mean that the world and its colors have to be utterly one note and boring.

The gameplay is nothing special.  The reaction time for enemies is so unnecessary.  Either I am across the map looking through the scope and all of a sudden they see me and open fire, or I am strutting down the street and walking up to each bandit to shake their hand and they don't notice.  Because of this, there really is no strategy of crawling around and taking out each individual separately.  Leveling is really quick at first to the extent that I played most of the entire base game 5-10 levels higher than my enemies.  The quests are just more bs fetch quests supposed to bring you closer to opening a vault that I could not care less about.

GUNS. GUNS. AND MORE GUNS. Other than for its art style, Borderlands is known for its wide range of weaponry. Now take more than half of them and toss them out the window, because they are utterly pointless (this as well includes all elemental weapons as there was no need for them in my playthrough since I always had a weapon whose base damage did far more than what one of those could do).

As to not carry on anymore.  The vehicles are crap. The humor is most of the time repetitive and unfunny.

Essentially, Borderlands is an addictive drug. Not because of it bringing a period of euphoria, but because it left me in the back alley, shivering and crying, no job, no joy. And yet, I still went back to it. Don't be like me. Be like that guy who decided to save his money and spend his time on a game worth it.

Game: 3/10"
2764,"Yeah, it's pretty good..."
2765,­
2766,"Thousands years after it came out it is still 129 Turkish Liras (86,43 TRY on discount as of today) which is crazy considering sequels are much cheaper..."
2767,thank you very cool
2768,Used to couch co-op this with friends when this released. In 2019 it still has replayability.
2769,"Despite the fact that Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel are obviously better, I cannot tear myself away from the original game. It's got its own charm over the sequels and still gives an enjoyable experience, especially with the recently released Enhanced Edition. I do recommend picking it up when it's on sale though - at least half the price should be fair."
2770,nice if you feel like shooting things. not nice otherwise
2771,Fav
2772,There's no rest fo da wickeed~ Mooneeh don't grow on trees~
2773,"This game is a must-have!

If you have not purchased Borderlands 2 and buy  pre-sequel aswell

Immerse yourself on the world of Pandora.
Go on Quests 
Punch things
Get wicked cool guns 
Farm and grind for the best gear.


*Do not support epic games and their tycoon. 
wait for Borderlands 3 to come to steam.*"
2774,there was a time when borderlands was tolerable and that time was pre-dlc borderlands 1
2775,i came back to this thinking of all the funny line and good times i had with this game. then i started playing it and oh boy did i forget how much of a piece of shit this game is and honestly once you hear all the funny lines once or twice coming they dont ever become funny again even after coming back after years doesnt help and my god the bugs enemies spawning in the ground where i cant kill them that sort of thing the driving its absolutely horrible the dlc's are shit for the most part please for your sake keep your money and get a game you will actually enjoy.
2776,ok
2777,Bad.. Just play 2 (not 3 ffs).
2778,"Steampunk Alice in Wonderland on Crack

fuck this game"
2779,Game worth what I paid and that is ~3 euro. Full price? You got to jocking for this kind of poor quality game.
2780,if your into shit with nine toes this game is for you
2781,"It was good for the first 8.2 hours

but it got boring after that."
2782,"I owned Borderlands when it first came out, and now got it on a special pre: Borderlands 3. Nice to play through again, Maps are interesting and it now has a great nostalgia feeling. Just as an important note: if you get this, and get the enhanced edition of the same game - you can import your character to the enhanced, which ports some achievements but not all - so if you are a completionist you will be doing some achievements in both games. This could take a long time if you plan on multiple playthroughs."
2783,"I do not recommend this game because I literally could not play it since it lacked an FOV slider and I had to lay down after an hour, terrible game, don't play"
2784,"i'm just upset they didn't give us the opportunity for more character customization options or the ability to create our own unique characters with ability of our own choosing, making the game more fun. Other than that the game is lots of fun compared to most FPS games out there on the market. Soundtrack is good, Game play is smooth, and the shooting is not garbage.  10 out 10 would recommend."
2785,"The fact ive been playing this game since is was 4 years old i really do enjoy this REMASTERED version and the way it feels and how the nostaligia starts to kick in while you enter the *VERY PEACEFUL* town of Fyrestone is really cool how people still play this game in 2019 and as a OG player of this game its amazing how 2K and GEARBOX is doing the remasterd all the glitch spots have been sadly patched but over all the amazing feel of the game is still in it and i do Recommend this game :)

very good SHOOTER LOOTER aswell highly recommed this awesome game."
2786,"7/10

Very well made FPS that does not take itself seriously. I have played only the single player campain. 
pros: humor, weapon variaty, LOOT
cons: dull color palete, low enemy variaty
I realy liked the ""fog of war"" - suroundings become blurry when you aim without the scope."
2787,"Game is unplayable due to a error:
General protection fault"
2788,"Do you sometimes want to just shoot thing when you get home from work?
Borderlands has OK difficulty, lots of enemies, lots of weapons, sufficient customization and the story&world are quite fun.
This game is excellent."
2789,"Played this game my entire 6th and 7th grade year. Still Play it sometimes. Runs great on any computer and fun to mess around in with friends, do side missions with friends you never did, farm crawmerax or just play the story by yourself."
2790,"I used to love the Borderlands series, but because the CEO, Randy Pitchford, is sharing animal abuse videos on Twitter, I can no longer support Gearbox in good faith."
2791,"Gotta get that sweet loots... and it's being brought together with something great, like two canabalistic midgets in a fat guys rib cage."
2792,"The first and best of the series. The humor is more subtle and reserved, and while it falls into cringe territory in the DLCs, it's certainly not Anthony Burch levels of bad. The UI is clean, usable, and doesn't unnecessarily segment one screen's worth of info into three tabs you have to jump through. The guns look very samey, but they all work properly and feel like they have a purpose, as opposed to half of the sequels' armories feeling like they were designed to be memes. The story's fairly weak and barely there, but that's better than what you get with the sequels. Overall, it's an enjoyable experience, and the biggest knock against it is having to use a hacky workaround  to get the FOV set to something actually reasonable, and the ""enhanced edition"" remake adopts some of the negative UI degradations introduced by BorderLands 2 into the mix."
2793,"Borderlands - Game that you can play anytime, solo or with friends.
Prepare for a lot of loot, skills, fun and more.
Some people prefer Borderlands 2, but i can say that you should definetly play the first Borderlands too.
Borderlands has a cool DLC's that you should buy if you like the game.

2794,fun looter shooter

2798,"This is actually a great game, but I hate Randy Pitchford. (10/10)"
2799,"Truly an amazing rpg fps crossblend , tailor made for the generally indecisive . The game has tons of originality , and very memorable characters , all set to a unique graphical background ."
2800,"SO HARDCORE AND NEVER HAVE A CHANCE 
WHY I BUY THIS"
2801,A great game that you should play if you like looter shooters.
2802,"Boring, I have no idea why I bought this game!"
2803,A great debut of a great franchise.
2804,"Expectedly weak compared to the sequels, but still a very good intro to the Borderlands franchise and to looter shooters in general."
2805,Game of the year? I disagree.
2806,"Borderlands é um jogo extremamente divertido, com muitas quests secundarias que são ou muito divertidas ou muito desafiadoras.

Esse jogo possui um sistema muito legal, Quase não existe nenhum bug que prejudique o jogador, e no geral é uma coisa de louco a quantidade de coisas que vc consegue fazer nele.

Eu recomendo ele por ser um ótimo jogo para passar um tempo com amigos, ou até mesmo jogando sozinho, o que me gera muita nostalgia de jogos passados E futuros."
2807,"Fucking awful job by 2k, no 144hz hz working on it and bad lag and performance in rooms later on in the game. Avoid."
2808,"A giant disclaimer: Borderlands games are best played co-op. I actually wouldn't recommend BL1 if you're considering it solo.

BL1 is pretty rough these days. The best I can do is look at it as a necessary step towards the better games in the series and a good title for its time, though of course I played through it entirely with friends. Really, that's a good summary of the entire series. These aren't bad games but it is telling that I've only seriously played BL2 solo. They're great co-op games when everybody is on board for seeing the story through.

The foundation of the setting starts here. Pandora is a real dumpster of a planet where a mysterious vault may be present but the local wildlife is crazy aggressive and the mega-corporations of the galaxy abandoned efforts to colonize and strip-mine the planet, leaving behind a conscripted convict population. This makes for the iconic armies of bandits and psychos tearing up the joint. You're one of four optimistic mercenaries willing to kill their way to the Vault while running errands for wacky rednecks. You won't be getting anything else about the player characters so that's it. Seeing as we're almost ten years out I will spoil the ending: it's not great. The Vault is holding a Cthulu that you shoot to death. No moral.

All that said BL1 has the most subdued story of the series. Often all that accompanies you in exploring locations or walking between firefights is the soft twangs of guitars and the occasional recording of things going horrible long ago. There are silly NPCs but a lot are just weathered people trying to endure their terrible circumstances and asking you for some help. This is a much more grounded setting than Borderlands 2 or Pre-Sequel by far which has a certain appeal. If Tiny Tina got on your nerves you might appreciate BL1 a lot more. Unfortunately this does lead to some undercooked portions. There isn't a grand villain to anchor things to, most of your antagonists being one-note bandit lords and the hastily stapled on Commandant Steele of the Crimson Lance, a Siren who forgets she is one in every appearance. The best part of the atmosphere is probably tracking Tannis' descent into madness as well as the environmental storytelling.

You have to enjoy the core gameplay of Borderlands or it won't grow on you with or without friends. You carry four guns with a good variety of little tweaks to how they shoot as well as a handful of unique weapons. There's a good system to reward you for sticking with the gun types you like. About every 20-40 seconds you can press F to do something interesting. The enemy variety is acceptable though the behavior is pretty primitive. Most enemies randomly tag you with hit-scan weapons or blindly charge you to melee. You'll either weather their attacks without care or race for cover as the odd scaling randomly removes 75% of your shields and health in one shot. Many bosses can be defeated by backpedal strafing and are very simple meatwalls. 

This is more of a slow-paced long-term looter and shooter. You have about an hour of unskippable tutorial before you're allowed to use your Action Skill at all and it'll take most of the story before you've filled out one branch of a skill tree. It's a competent loot and shoot in a setting not often touched upon. It'll remind you of Diablo gameplay. Kill things, get loot, use it to kill things. There's often a MMO-style strain on your mind for the more tedious quest chores but thankfully most of those are optional. The hit detection can be very clunky, especially for high accuracy builds.

BL1 is strictly competent and an easy average or better for most. Unfortunately with so many stronger games to play these days I find it hard to recommend above them without friends. It just has an odd design where the co-op greatly elevates it. A good example of this would be the ""Fight For Your Life"" system. If you're reduced to 0 HP you do not immediately die but instead are rooted to the spot and have a chance to kill anything nearby to get back up. Of course you could die to a Damage Over Time or Environmental Effect after clearing enemies. You could be hit by enemies a mile away using hitscan as early as the first area. You'll often be put down by enemies that duck behind cover or go on excessively long pathfinding journeys around buildings or just fly away. And if your particular build is range limited, such as shotguns, well too bad. There's also a very irritating ""ahhh, I'm dying and fading fast"" automatic drag you have to compensate against.

Of course if you're playing with friends they can instead just run over and channel the interact key on you for a few seconds in a Risk vs Reward triage situation. It's infinitely smoother, fosters teamwork and awareness of surroundings and gives great incentive to risking leaving cover to help a buddy. Things like that. The Co-Op saves this game. You'll find that talking about gun stats, the guns you prefer to use and trading guns that aren't exciting for you but are for your buddy elevates the loot systems. The vehicles are wonky go-karts but fun devices for goofing off with when you rocket around picking up your pal, or race ahead of him and leave him in the dirt before you go back, or to line somebody up so that you push them with the car and see how far you can move them before they return from AFK. If you're goofing off than BL1 is a good sandbox for it. Kill some guys, drive around being silly, appreciate some ambiance and lore. It was a good cycle for me at release.

The DLCs are more of the same with some better production values and enemy variety. Knoxx is a highlight. At least they're baked into this GOTY edition and the game comes with a sorely needed texture update so arguably it is worth $30. It's a much better $10 or less 9 years later. If you knew you had somebody playing with you from start to finish I'd push towards $20. As a solo game it'd probably be better to just start with Borderlands 2 or to wait for a sale."
2809,port it to mac and linux please.
2810,"So I've been playing Borderlands since it came out almost a decade ago. It's such a fun looter shooter to just mess about with your friends in, and I can't recommend it enough or say anything that hasn't been said before. I have a lot of good memories buried in this game.

The Underdome sucks though, worst DLC I've ever had to grind achievements out of."
2811,"When the original is less buggy than the update

"
2812,It's Borderlands. There isn't much more you can say. Great story great gameplay.
2813,Bad
2814,"Borderlands has a really unique art style and fun game play. With wacky characters and villians, this game is best played with friends but is also an enjoyable game played in singleplayer."
2815,⭐⭐
2816,weno
2817,Hey look another game Steam has manipulated the review score on. Another good game that I can't recommend due to Steam's anti-consumer practices of manipulating review scores to appease publishers.
2818,"guns, guNS, GUNS!"
2819,allways fun
2820,The G.O.T.Y Edition looks amazing
2821,"Such an amazing game. Short and sweet, brings back so many nostalgic memories. Everything other than the graphics is amazing, granted its 2009 graphics so. 9/10 :D"
2822,"This game which started the fun genre of shooting and looting, is an enjoyable one.

The graphics are very nice with the iconic cell-shading
Gameplay is so much fun specially with friends
The Main Story and DLC Stories are so much fun to play

I recommend this game, but I highly advise you to buy it with all DLCs, because the game is boring without them, wait for a sale (usually gets down to as low as $5.90) to pick up this game alongside BL2 and BLTPS with all their DLCs for the maximum fun package."
2823,The 1st real shooter looter RPG !
2824,need to play more
2825,"Very funs, with lots of guns, run and run, gun and gun, then it hits you with that BOOM, get a better gun, then kill some bad dudes, get a very good gun, kill everyone. Very satisfying blowing someones head off, and blowing up raiders. i think this pretty much sums up the entire game. 8/10 would recommend."
2826,horrible game.
2827,"The visuals in this game are so horrendous, it will make your eyes twitch, thinking, why would anyone make the game look this bad on purpose"
2828,"One of the best games I`ve played on pc and console, really love the story and the characters."
2829,"I love this game, I played borderlands 2 for years, and i'm gonna say the same for this one. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys FPS games."
2830,"When Randy Pritchford invited me to his ""Peacock Theater"" as a performer, I honestly don't know what was going through my head. I was only 17, or as Randy called me, ""barely legal"". I guess I was legal under state law. But it still felt weird stripping for him,  I was a huge fan of Borderlands but what lengths does a girl have to go to get her Claptrap poster signed by the dev team? Apparently stripping for Randy Pritchford and co. is enough! The weirdest part was that Randy filmed it, and told me that ""chat"" was telling me to do things? I think he called it a ""Cam site""?  I was a ""cam girl""? And the weirdest part, if you can believe it, is that he wanted me to ""fake an ejac"". His words! He said it was ""magic"", but honestly I don't believe much that Randy says. After everything I've been through, Randy Pritchford seems like a liar and con-man, who want's to ejac on young girls. That is a fact. Also Borderlands is fine, but avoid the 3rd one!"
2831,"Pitchford is nothing short of filth. 

Borderlands is pretty good, though."
2832,Fuck Randy Pitchford
2833,never going to Epic store
2834,"I always felt like Borderlands was overrated, and it was mostly held up by the post-apocalyptic wasteland buzz that Fallout 3 generated at the time. It can be fun with friends, but you're better off playing Borderlands 2 with friends."
2835,played this for months on Xbox 360 and ps3
2836,"I'll be honest, I love these games, but I'm not gonna install a shitty launcher just to play the new one. Hope everyone who gets it ""early"" enjoys because I won't be spending any money to support backhanded business that's more about hurting the competition than it is about making people what to use your services."
2837,i do love this and the 1st one as will i'm still sad for borderlands 3 comes out on 2020 on steam but i can wait

2840,Thanks gearbox :) for showing how much you truly care about the people who love and support your games :)
2841,"I am quite a fan of this game, even though I generally avoid fps games. I was promised to be able to lock, load and face the madness which is a direct challenge to the modern conventions of the fps games which are Call of Duty and its ilk. Mind blowing insanity was delivered via huge arsenal of guns and I can say I am certainly all the more maniacal for it!

You can select 1 of 4 extremely trigger happy mercenaries, who have landed on the planet Pandora, and either play solo or co-op as you fight your way across this lawless, desolate world in search of The Vault. Known only as Vault Hunter in game (though you get the option to name and a couple of colour customisation options for your character), you are hell-bent on trying to find this legendary stockpile of mysterious alien technology which has been hidden away on this planet. Such level of determination is needed as the local inhabitants are either friendly and slightly off-kilter, extremely hostile and wanting to eradicate you from this galaxy through any means necessary, or simply viewing you as lunch.
If you keep your eyes peeled, you can spot the tad bits of lore which are hidden throughout the world, mostly in the form of the various corporations which manufacture the guns you collect in game. Though some lovable characters you encounter do dispense some interesting words over the tape player, which also give you most funny what was that moments - I am looking at you Moxxi.

As expected, the vast majority of the game's mechanics are you typical fps ones; point and click at your enemy, reload, throw grenade, duck behind cover and run around a lot while laughing hysterically. There is the option for vehicle combat and driving around between the large map locations, though careful it doesn't get too damaged and blow up in your face!
The rpg elements consist of selecting a class (which are all distinct from each other) and spending skill points across 3 different sub-trees, followed by selecting various guns and shields to help you in combat. It is easy to get a little bogged down with the stats on the weapons and can take a bit of time to work out which gun is better. There is a lot of numbers to crunch as you compare ammo capacity, damage, damage type, weapon type, accuracy and recoil. The big plus is that it is very easy to find something which fits your play style, the flexibility there and with the different class skills is a big bonus. 

I think the art style is quite distinctive and I believe it was a brand new style Gearbox created to really make the game stand out from other games when this was first released. It really builds on the rough and sand beaten world of Pandora, clear line of vision under the blistering sun and the option to remove said glare if it is making it hard to shoot your foes.
The character and location designs give me a post-apocalyptic vibe, as everyone sees to be grabbing whatever they can get their hands of to either eat, wear or use. The various enemies you encounter fit well with the world and you can believe they call Pandora home, do try not cuddle the skags!

I like that it does not take itself too seriously and the developers have a good sense of humour; it nice to play a tongue in cheek game, with some over the top characters, a dash of dark humour and a whole lot of of shooting everything in sight. Definitely recommend this game!"

2853,wow good game
2854,"I just completed my first playthrough of this game and I have to say I really enjoyed it. Except for the final level Borderlands carefully walked a thin line between open world and easily navigable levels that made the whole world feel expansive but not overwhelming. Some may take issue with a perceived lack of story, but for me the story was about your experience in a dying world that was written by your actions, not exposition dumps. In other words, a minimalist approach to story. Neither exposition heavy or light is necessarily better than the other, but with Borderlands the minimalist approach worked and felt right. Most importantly with Borderlands is the gunplay; it is, after all, first and foremost a shooter and shooting is where it succeeds wonderfully. The gunplay just feels great, better than many level driven or rail shooters and (with the exception of the first major boss fight which locks you in a tiny hole with a massive dude) it allows players to play however they want to. I personally prefer killing everything from a long way off in complete safety and the game let me do that, just as it allowed me to rush in with machine guns and shotguns with my secondary character. All in all, I think Borderlands is well worth buying and playing, and actually a better game overall than the sequel which has an awful UI and no good health regen options."

2856,Not too rich story but really fun to play.
2857,"Good for it's time, but a bit clunky now. The formula has been revised and improved in the sequels though."
2858,"Love it always have, hell i even went to its midnight release!"
2859,uwu
2860,"The gameplay is excellent, and the singular graphic style is unlike anything else out there. That being said, all the playable characters are psychopaths who kill everything that moves and chortle with glee over their kills. This game is incredibly fun, but I feel unclean after playing. It's probably why I played it through once but deleted it afterwards. After a couple years I reinstalled it and played it through again as a different playable character, but I'm having the same reaction as before."
2861,Fun fun fun
2862,"You know, I see all these hate comments about it being trash, but, the pictures that you see ARE NOT from the new edition! Trust me, the new edition is hell of a lot of fun with friends! Even by yourself, you'll find yourself wanting to be playing the next mission.
Don't get me wrong, the story isn't thought out well, but the gameplay is amazing! The boss fights feel like ACTUAL challenges! If you like looter shooters, running and gunning, GET THIS GAME!"
2863,Fun if a but grindy. I played it solo and it was ok
2864,barely played lol i got for free as gif because i played bl2
2865,Chicken aproves of dis game. And i got it for free because I had borderlands 1 origanal XD.

2876,The best FPS I have played and still playing 😀. In my opinion it's better than the rest in the market.
2877,"Gonna keep it short and sweet:
Great FPS with good length, humor and art style, really enjoyable DLCs (except Moxxi's Underdome, that is an arena thing I'm not a fan of), memorable characters, replayability and, for its time, was the only FPS to have procedurally generated gun combinations, which added to the possibility of the player revisiting a certain gun type after finding a better drop of it (like a shotgun that has a narrower spread or higher bullet count.

Never had chance to play in co-op, but heard well of it too."
2878,this game is boring as hell
2879,ok
2880,"Personally I like to play games at 600 EDPI, or 4.5 degrees for every centimetre I move my mouse, but that isn't possible in any of the Borderlands games because of the distinct lack of sensitivity options. Like seriously, the lowest amount is almost ten times as much as I want it to be! The game is such a masterpiece but it is completely ruined by the lack of comfort I am forced to have by these horrible settings. Some love letter to PC gamers this was supposed to be, I wouldn't recommend playing this game at all if you have even a moderately low sensitivity. I originally played this franchise on my PS3 and my PS4, and I was having so much fun there, finishing at least one character of TVHM with DLC for each game, and it was amazing, but the ridiculously, unreasonably high sensitivity I am forced to endure on PC is just not worth it whatsoever. I bought this game a week before GOTY Enhanced was released."
2881,"Can only play the first three games on steam, then have to purchase the best installment on a completely different platform."
2882,"A fun action packed game with a decent enough and wacky story line, the DLC adds a bit as well.

2883,I do not recommend this game.
2884,Solid single player shooter that is even better with friends!
2885,i want to see randy pitchfrok angry because review bomb
2886,The new update has riddled my games with numerous bugs including lack of control over my character to sound related problems. I'm glad you continue to update these games but when they ruin the existing product you need to either fix or remove said update.
2887,"[h1]Borderlands GOTY[/h1]
[u]""Well shit, look at that!""[/u]

I was very late to the party on Borderlands. I first started playing this game in 2016 after being berated for years by friends for not owning it. Once in I was hooked, great gun play with a ludicrous amount of weapons. Great characters and humour. The main story is very short but there are hundreds of side missions. All the DLC is fun (With an exception)

Get some friends together and this game doubles in fun. The enemies grow stronger and can sometimes be overwhelming.  

The only bad part in my opinion is the Underdome DLC while its fun and challenging the larger matches are 100 rounds and this can take over 2 hours each time. Its just a little overkill for time consumption.

PS Mordecai is awesome!

Time to crack on with Borderlands 2 so I'm not 6 years late for Borderlands 3 

[i][u][b]Trail-Dave[/b][/u][/i]

""Ohh Smokin' Jesus titty cinnamon! That is a monster! That's gonna be sweet!"""
2888,GREAT GAME!!! i just came back to it after having my PC upgraded(played like a potato on my old laptop)and now having the equipment to run this game at 60 fps at best settings i can say this game feels like a whole new game(the goty edition) even without 4k uhd blah blah it is graphically amazing. Cant wait for borderlands 3.
2889,A classic that I just now gave the time to play. Great game for the time but honestly I don't like the balancing of guns by making them more or less accurate. Though Once I did get a sniper rifle with 98.8 accuracy I was able to pop heads off so easy man. headshots or bust.
2890,"Gearbox has officially been added to my do not buy list, their CEO has shown a complete lack of respect for the customer and the current business practices by their publisher has been very anti-consumer.

The publisher may choose what platform the game's launch on but at the end of the day it's a customer who decides if they sell."
2891,"the game is really amazing and was the first ever game i was really interested in but sadly the enhanced edition will not work on my computer and i don't know how to fix it, the error notification is ""general protection error"" if anyone could please help me solve this problem i would be so so greatfull

-ya_boi"
2892,"Even if you don't anyone else with borderlands to play with, it is still extremely fun and is one of my favorite games."
2893,"Great game. Absolutely fantastic. There is a reason why it kept Borderlands in the minds of gamers until Borderlands 2 came along and basically cemented itself as one of the best games out there.

Pros:
-Game still holds up graphics wise. Tweak the settings a bit and it actually looks pretty great to this day.
-Ties into my previous point but the Artstyle is standout among its peers and is timeless to look at. 
-Gunplay feels good on the large. There are a few gun types which are.... weak... but largely they feel pretty solid.
-Nice soundtrack.
-Enemy banter feels defenitely post-apocalyptic and is suitably psychotic to match.
-Vehicles feel good. Some might disagree with this but I personally find mouse directed driving to be fine but thats up to personal preference.
-Boss battles are memorable. I mean. No spoliers but some of them do stick with you for a while.

Cons:
-Areas can feel samey. A lot of the game you will be looking at the same dusty browns and muted greens. Expect to see a lot of wasteland.
-Some DLC's can be pretty easy depending on what character you chose.
-Gun variety looks wise is very limited. The model variety for guns wasnt very broad so most guns resemble each other very closely, no matter their manufacturer.
-Legendary weapons aren't very unique compared to ones from later games. This one may feel like a no-brainer but when you have a legendary revolver who's quirk is that it has only 2 high powered rounds, you start to feel a bit cheated.
-Enemy variety is mainly just bandits. For most of the game you just fight the same bandits with occasionally something unique thrown in.


Verdict: 8/10
Most of my complaints were small grievances compared to what the game did right. Yes the game can be limited at times but it still feels great to play for what it is.


Additional (Post GOTY edition):
For some people their game does not have the GOTY improvements and this should be noted. I do not know if this effects people buying the game now or if its just the people with the game already installed."

2898,"Having a blast replaying the remastered version.  Stuff that bothered me in the original (example car handling badly) no longer seems to cause problems.  However, sometimes the voices cut out (notably during the Baron encounter) and there is a mystery marker, which can be removed on the map, which always returns."

Buy it if you've been thinking about it, you won't regret it if you like looter shooters.

The only reason people are downvoting is for a completely unrelated issue that has little/nothing to do with this gem. IT DOES NOT JUSTIFY VIOLATING OTHER GAMES.

Pros 
- No Hassle with DLC anymore.
- Graphics are a lovely cartoonish style with bold outlines.
- Characters with different abilities.
- Four player fun!!
- Minimap!

Cons
- Glitches tend to be abundant.
- Bullet collision detection is really off, even in solo play (You should shoot a bandit or something who is standing still, and the bullet will soar through his head)."
2901,very good game
2902,"awesome game, hella fun and lots of loot"
2903,"Great story, voice acting, and gunplay. Awesome shooter, and with the DLC many, many hours of shooting things in the face.

Only catch, if you haven't picked it up yet, pick up The Enhanced version instead. Better graphics, and improved inventory management."
2904,Terrible
2905,I will change this review if Borderlands 3 is not an Epic Store exclusive at launch. Otherwise it will remain negative as a representation on my feelings for releasing a game to a specific online digital distributor as a whole.
2906,2k needs to take notice and realize that the customer is always right.
2907,"I heard you don't like reviews ... that's why you want to go to the EPIC store .. so customers can't post review ...

Exclusive games ... are not pro consumer ..."
2908,"Wanted to buy Borderlands 3, sadly they decided to gate it off on the epics games store. I will not support them with such a blatant anti consumer practice. I didn't plan on adding to the review bomb but after all the drama Randy is causing with his tweets I had to comment. He's making it seem like he only wamts positive reviews or no reviews at all. If I buy something I should have the chance to review it as I see fit if something is wrong."
2909,More boring version of BL2. Also fuck exclusivity deals.
2910,.|.
2911,GL with EGS
2912,"I can not recommend Borderlands to anybody anymore. From what I've seen of the ""enhanced"" version is buggy and can be game breaking. In addition to old bugs that never got fixed in the original game/DLCs. As well as Gearbox software attacking their former customers and fans, when they were called out for making choices that consumers; who already gave them money time and again; didn't want them to do.  If you get the game for free, play it. But don't give gearbox money ever again. I LOVED this game. 

And shame on valve. You defended several game's right to exist before but censoring your paying customers for advising other potential customers to avoid a product that is bad for consumers. SHAME!"
2913,"Played on consoles first. Good port, nice looter shooter gameplay!"
2914,Shitty enemy/weapon balancing thats so bad i had to get a friend who is op af to kill the first boss for me because i couldnt get a weapon strong enough PLUS a bland story that forgettable?  Your not missing anything. Get  Borderlands 2 instead

2926,Game looked promising but was unplayable without an fov slider. Hopefully Borderlands 1 remastered will have one. Then the game shall be heat.
2927,"While I only have 4 hours on Steam in this game, I've got probably > 1000 hours in the retail edition. This game was a total suprise for me when it came out. I bought it on a whim with a friend of mine and we both got hooked. I played Mordecai and he played Lilith. During our many hours we annihilated every enemy and boss and we gathered all the gear we wanted.

This game is so much fun and because you can constantly find new gear you don't stop playing.

I'm very curious about the remastered version which is coming out tomorrow."
2928,"This is a truly amazing game and ive been playing it since 2011. I can't wait until the remaster tomorrow!

playing the remaster for sure though"

2933,"I've had Borderlands for 10 Years now, Its always been my favorite game and I still play it to this day. Such a unique game and the first looter shooter there was, Graphics still hold up to this day, with the remaster coming tomorrow this game will be a perfect looter shooter RPG, with the little bugs there are being fixed and improvements to the game itself. 10/10 Would buy for the 5th time."
2934,"I remember playing with 3 of my friends on campus all night just to finish this game, it was a total blast.
Definitely a life stealer.
Can't wait for the update on April third."
2935,Waiting for the Re-Master ~! Minimap oh lord! Borderlands 2 was fun. Borderlands Pre-Sequel was way more fun (gravity jump AND BUTT SLAM!!) I Technically i have all the PC version. Why cant game developers make games like this ? Better than Anthem and Mass Effect (EA was  a letdown). BORDERLANDS 3 take my MONEY =) >.< . Im a fan of Far Cry series or open world games. i just love this kind of games. I want B3 now. yo hooo.
2936,"Weapons, weapons, weapons!"
2937,Fun game. Loved blowing off heads with the sniper. Great Story...was a little disappointed with the ending though. RPG/FPS....nice mix.
2938,"this is the best borderlands game out of all of them in my opinion, and the remake comes out soon if you already own this one you get the remastered on for free. i don't know how much the remaster will be but if it is $20 or more, then buying this gets you the dlc's for free basicly."
2939,Borderlands 3 and epic 6 months b4 everyone else enjoy fans.
2940,"The game that would define the looter shooter genre 10 years later and is still the champion among its kind.

Also, if you buy the base game of Borderlands (no need to buy DLC) right now before April 3, 2019 you will get the remastered version of the original Borderlands + all of its DLC, FOR FREE when it releases on April 3rd (confirmed by 2K). So you better buy it while it is cheap, before they increase the price for the remastered edition!"
2941,You know why.
2942,"don't let my time played fool you, i've played 100s of hours across the franchise on console, and this is where it started.... hands down, one of the best games i've ever played, and the remaster is free for steam owners....great move from gearbox"
2943,OG Looter/Shooter.  Still the best franchise.
2944,"Easily one of the best Shoot-N-Loot / Shoot-N-Scoot games I've ever played. Very light on story, as this game feels more like a tech demo for the gun generation system, but that's alright. That system makes up for it in my mind."
2945,good game had it on ps3 bought it again. get it
2946,REMASTEEEER
2947,Waiting for a remastered version. :)
2948,"This game is so great, just anxiously waiting for the remaster. The atmosphere is done beyond perfect. The feeling of pure desolation is done so well."
2949,it needs programmable controller buttons like bl2 and prequelsequel.
2950,"Superb game, can't wait for the remaster, let's just hope they add an FOV slider this time round."
2951,Borderlands 1 remaster waiting room
2952,If you enjoy video games to any extent you must buy this game. Remaster is coming soon.

2959,"What a fun coop game with fun dlc except for the ned zombie island for me it was boring for others may be a fun dlc but not for me.
The game can be for like a hundreds of hours and still be fun after it.
Also on 3rd of april will be a free remaster of this game (free for owners of the original game).
WHICH IT WILL BE EVEN MORE FUN THAN BEFORE HURRAY.
Sure it aint that perfect game it has some downsides like driving,non farmable bosses or shooting.
I hope it will be changed in the remaster.
I GIB SOLID 9/10"
2960,Remaster hype
2961,"Very nice game to play in a party , new versions of it came to the market too"
2962,"Overall amaizing game 10/10.

The gameplay is a bit weird if you play Cod or Battlefield or a lot of different games altogether. In this game you have chest which have guns that are cool af. Guns are used to kill things and to advance through the game. There are a billion guns in the game, being a loot and shoot. The graphics are somewhat weird, but you dont see cell shading too often. The biggest reason to get this game is......Ah who am i kidding?
Just get this master piece.Also the remaster is coming at 3rd of April."
2963,This game is for BIG BOYS also who is HYPED for BORDERLANDS 3
2964,"wait for the remaster patch, play with friends, and cross your fingers they get rid of all those annoying frame drops
even if you have a beast of a pc, you will get frame drops.

Also, cars drive unforgivably bad, there are tons of bullet sponge enemies, like the completely non fun ones. The ones that require you to wait for a split second rng(because of animations) based crit spot to show up to do any damage to it, for instance. Alpha skags can got to hell. Good tip, your team should consist of brick, brick, brick, and also brick. It is the only way to play."
2965,"For an game of it's time, it's amazing. for today's standards it fun but just ever so lacking. totally worth a buy in my opinion but if you want to get hooked on the Borderlands craze, go for Borderlands 2 first, It won't spoil the story much at all but you wont fully understand the importance  of the characters. That's what I did"
2966,"""If you own the game on Steam by April 3, you'll get the update for free. So grab it now and wait for the update."" - IGN per Gearbox.

So much hype for this remaster!!

Rotating minimap, character customization options, and so much more.

I've played these games (all of them) for years on console and I think my only true gripe about the first game was that enemies didn't scale with you. I really think that needs to be an option."
2967,Countless Hours on Xbox 360; still amazing in 2019 only problem with the game is that I cant change my FOV. Just gonna wait for the remaster to be released to clean up some of the smaller problems in the game.
2968,"Amazing, classic, and just an overall very fun game!"
2969,only 4 more days and this already amazing game will be even better. <3 2K
2970,"The game that started it all; the game that introduced me to one of my favorite series. Borderlands is a dusty gem in a cave of flashy fools gold. This game stands out from many others in its genre, but can also fall short in some aspects. 

Pros
1. Quick, fun, and action-packed gameplay.
2. Plenty of content that keeps the player hooked (depending on how thorough the player is).
3. Buttloads of guns.

Cons
1. Outdated graphics and options.
2. Lackluster story.
3. Bad AI (for certain enemies)."
2971,"One of my favorite game series.  I liked the style of it with cell shading and the total weirdness of it is what drew me to it in the first place.  Lots and LOTS of guns, good story, lots of fun to replay it over and over again.

Best of us, the remaster of the game is coming in 4 days and everyone who owns the game already gets it free.   Can't wait till I actually have a system that can handle 4K to actually see what it looks like at 4K.

This is how you treat your loyal fans and keep them coming back for more."
2972,second best game evar!!!!(first one is borderlands 2 ^-^)
2973,"A total blast and lots of fun! Complete missions, blast everything to a pulp, loot better weapons and gear, and repeat and repeat, and that's basically Borderlands. 

Graphics are really nice and the cartoony style fits the game well. Sound, music and story are also well done. Lots of different enemies to kill, some can be challenging, and this is true all the way through the game as they level up with you and become stronger.

There is an endless variety of different weapons available which can randomly drop, which means you are always on the lookout for that ultra-amazing bad-a#s weapon to obliterate the bad guys with. The game also offers lots of different ways to play and gives you a choice of 4 characters with different abilities, which makes for lots of replayability. A single playthrough takes around 30 hrs for the main game, and the DLC adds an extra 25+ hours.

The only criticism I have is the repetition, cos all you do is shoot things and go from mission to mission and shoot some more things, but like I said its just a ton of fun and its one of those games where you can switch your brain off for a few hours and just have a blast.

A claptastic 9/10"
2974,"a super god game, every secound is worth it"
2975,Great game
2976,"The field of view makes me sick. I tried editing the config file, but that did not work."
2977,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je_hlExnpPs
2978,"There isn't much of a story to be found, and the ending is kind of a letdown. But the shoot-and-loot gameplay is addictive, and I found myself spending hours playing this game so that I could take on basically every available mission."
2979,"I usually only post reviews after or near completion but I'll make an exception for this game. If you are running a modern OS ie post Vista then you may have problems running it. If you have a recent video card the same applies. Fixing these issues is fairly easy but my question is why Gearbox can't be bothered to do it themselves. We are drowning in the live service model that is being rammed down our throats but this model is seemingly unable to patch a game to a playable state.
Let's cut to the chase. If you like a game with story and immersion that runs straight out of the box then this isn't the game for you. If you want a little bit of history and are curious as to what all the fuss is about then give it a try. Don't pay full price though and be prepared to tinker. For me personally I'm on the fence but the way this works is you can't post a review with that option so I can't really recommend it."
2980,my all time favourite game from the best year.
2981,"Borderlands is my all-time favorite franchise.  Great game play and artwork, but most importantly, outstanding humor.  Borderlands is my favorite of the franchise in terms of atmosphere and artwork.  I've been playing it since it came out and continue to play it today.  Most of my hours were on Xbox360, but I've played a bunch on PC as well.   Did I mention guns...?"
2982,i like it
2983,BORDERLANDS!!!!!
2984,KABOOM
2985,Buy this game instead of the remaster
2986,Amazing game
2987,"This is by far my favorite game ever to exist!! Don't get me wrong I love the whole Borderlands series but the original has my heart. When this game was on Xbox 360 I beat the game & all DLC 6+ times including second playthroughs. This game has a unique look, interesting story, full of humor & is absolutely addicting! I'm so ecstatic for the remastered version!"
2988,awesome game
2989,"Only 45 hours so far on PC, I pre-ordered this game for 360 on first release, I've beat it about six times, once as each character and multiple as Lilith. 

Chaotic FPS multiplayer with RPG elements (skill tree's, not much else)

Borderlands has a very high replay value and it is very easy to drop-in drop-out of multiplayer with friends and randos.

Five stars.

(If you liked BL2, this game is 1000x better)"
2990,"Posting to give the game a positive review before the remaster releases! 

The series may have kicked off hardcore with the second installment, but this is still a solid experience for anyone who wants to see where it all began. Give it a shot if you're a fan of the looter-shooter genre, it won't disappoint especially if played with friends!"
2991,IT'S HAPPENING
2992,"The original looter Shooter. Even 10 (yes,10)  years later it still holds up by having game play that is super fun, weapon variety that is better than 2 in many ways, and the feel of finding and opening a treasure chest is still the best in this game than any other looter shooter. Story and class variety were not the best in the first entry compared to the later games, as well as the environments feeling very similar compared to 2 and the Pre-Sequel although the opening Badlands is still extremely atmospheric to me. Certainly a must play before you get into the later games if you are a player looking to get into this series."
2993,"Before they remaster it, I want to say: the original is amazing, even with sloppy menus and no minimap. Reason: this game has so many guns that you just can't stop searching for a more perfect one! 
If any game ever had a good grind, it's this one. Not all legendaries are created equal, and hunting for one with the perfect parts never gets old. Strongly recommend! 

ps. If you have time, read the quests - they're pretty funny."
2994,"The original looter shooter. Love this game, can't wait for the remaster."
2995,"If Telltale Games and Fallout had a baby, this is what I'd expect it to look like..."
2996,"It's a nice game, love it"
2997,"thumbs up for remastered edition. Thanks for giving your support for the community, I hope Borderlands 3 is on steam too please. >_<"
2998,Love the series from day 1. Love gearbox.
2999,I do hope the remaster also can be optional for OG steam players free
3000,Best Shooter looter Series Ever Made if u do not own then u a ungood human bean 16/16
3001,The first Looter shooter to do it right and still one of the best. Its still a great game and if you get it now. I heard if you have a copy. You get upgraded to the HD version to be released. I am definitely going to play it again in HD.
3002,"Outside of the usual first-person shooter mechanics, there’s not really anything out there like Borderlands. No other shooter has the same mix of frantic, fast-firing action and deep, loot-based role-playing game elements, and there’s definitely nothing out there as mind-blowingly crazy.   

[b]( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 10/10 [/b]

can't wait for the remaster!"
3003,"There's a lot to complain about. Enemies can't scale to your level until you beat the game, twice, so everything is a ridiculously easy clap until then due to how powerful coop is, and honestly after then too. Unless you're brick, because the game has really bad class balance due to poor scaling at the late game. And to beat the story twice you get to enjoy gunplay with about 60 guns that are going to feel fun and good to use per character - the rest are filler and experiencing using them for a bit until you get a good gun or when your good gun runs out of ammo. Maybe more guns if you exploit the glitch in the Knoxx DLC to farm for the unique weapons that boil down to effects like x5 damage crits and being a rocket launcher, but with a big magazine. The gunplay will be chopped up between quests, which you conveniently get to fast travel and drive around for a few minutes every time you turn one in, so you get to read completely uninteresting text pretty much every time that only really exists to give an excuse to proceeding to shoot new enemies, since it doesn't feel like the game really cares about story. The enemies were diverse enough to be fun to kill, usually. Also, don't hope for the other 3 DLCs to be rewarding or anything, they don't really give fun/good loot and the enemies get old fast. The bosses are not redeeming at any point in the game. I don't really know what else I got. I thought the humor was ok sometimes. The theme is pretty genuine, it really was cool to see the different areas of the world. The inventory and money are a joke when not irritating. Comparing weapons isn't worth the time it takes to make a judgement, it's pretty easy to avoid dying (as if losing money matters anyway), choose whatever you have fun shooting with regardless of DPS or whatever.

I am aware I am being pretty salty here. I had friends that wanted to play it with me and so I obliged, but it was disappointing and I don't want to vent at them to ruin their fun, so I'm mostly doing it here. It looks good and it shoots good, it just doesn't play good."
3004,"I have a feeling this game is going to get a lot better than it was before. 
God bless you Randy, it's like you're running a charity. 

Free upgrades years after release, constant sales, bundles, actually decent DLC (most of the time), you're remaking pathologic. 
I just...

Come here Randy. No no, come here, I'm serious. That's it bud. Take the hug. You've saved my money, ad I'm a greedy rat, so I love you."
3005,"The game that started the best Shooter Looter series in gaming history is worth every silly penny!  Releasing as a re-master on April 3, 2019 with all DLC included. Sweet! If you like open world exploring, humour, shooting and looting, then do yourself a big favour and buy this game NOW! The re-master will be free to current owners on Apr 3rd, so no reason to wait!  And welcome to Pandora, Vault Hunter!"
3006,The side missions in this game are a must 100% complete at least once. the stories are hilarious and weird and add to the overall aesthetic of borderlands greatly. the game wouldn't be the same without them
3007,Good game but FOV kills my brain cells
3008,"This game is great, but buy GotY edition when it comes out. Heavily reccomend for anyone who play 2/Pre-Sequel. Or 3, if that's out by the time you see this."
3009,2019 and still one of the hottest loot & shoot games out there <3
3010,Remaster is making my PP hard
3011,Im going to decide if the game is recomended or not after i play it again after the free 4k upgrade as its going to be adding a bunch more stuff to the game in terms of QOL such as a mini map
3012,Started out the best franchise ever!!!! BL3 Hype!
3013,Remaster Hype
3014,This right here is my favorite game
3015,We GOT THE REMASTER BOIS HELL YEAH
3016,"Really Makes You Feel Like Vault Finder........

honestly had no idea what was happening as my friend just sped through it whilst i killed mini drug lords... so yeah 10/10"
3017,"Really good FPS game with an RPG elements. At the start of the game, you can choose one of four playable classes and dive into the game. All the classes have talent trees, just like in WoW and every specialization has something to offer. Beside main story, it has enough content such as side quests and various achievements (some are hidden but unlock if criteria is met) to keep you invested in game for some time, plus DLC content. I spent about 74 hrs in the game. Was playing solo, only did Max Moxxi's DLC with a friend. I recommend it, grab it while it's on sale with all the DLC included, it's worth it! :]"
3018,"One of my all-time favorites. Great fun with friends, still looks good in 2019 due to it's bespoke art-style. Endless hours of fun! :D"
3019,"Put FOV slider in options for God sake. IS that hard? I wold request refund, but no refunds. Played more than two hours. NOT recommended."
3020,"Some one please help me!!! I switched all of my games to my new computer because we are getting ride of the old one, but I can't play any of my games on my new computer in less I stream it from my old one...but if we are getting ride of the old computer I won't be able to play them at all. so can some one please help me?"
3021,Simply put: masterpiece. Loved it.
3022,idk its not as good as the first one
3023,not as good as BL2 tho
3024,"The game is now more than a decade old.I bought when it first came out and still have the CD ROM for it,but of course we have Steam now who does all that instead of the disc.
The good points:
Interesting characters,plots and adventures all mixed in with a lot of humour.
The bad points:
Unable to triumph over the boss,Crawmerax.I got up to level 69 and I still cannot defeat him.There are two things that the creators here trip you up with:A) When you are first able to access his area,you usually around a 45 XP or so,but you don't have the weapons.When you do have the right equipment(like I did at level 69) he has leveled up along with you do you need stronger weapons,which you'll never get,and B)the more times you get out,the more replacement ammo you need,the less money you have, until soon you can't do it anyways because you can't afford any more ammo(it's a circle you can't get out of,and the creators know this).You go on You Tube to get some video help and all of them have multiple players taking on Crawmerax.There is nothing for just one person,because one person cannot do it.
Then there is Moxie's Underground,where the same scenario applies here as it does for Crawmerax.Earlier,it's a battle to get through the entire three rounds,so you think I'll come back when I have better XP and weapons.Well again,IT has upped its game too.There's no winning here either.
Finally we have the fact that to get more XP beyond around 50 you have to play the whole darn thing again.And considering you have the same outcome the second time as you had the first time around,why the heck would you?
I like a game,as I think most gamers do,where there is a beginning and a resolute ending.When you don't,what you have is frustration and dislike,which is what occurred with me.And the clucks at Gearbox went and did it two more times with the sequels.What the heck....???
"
3025,"LIKE IT
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE REMASTERED VERSION"
3026,This has been a fun time-draining game ever.
3027,"i reglet playing this game. 
 -4 out of 10. 

my honest review. i would rate the graphics somewhere between sufficient and not so good. FPS runs a mere 62 on my rtx2080. UI is not good either. equipping and comparing guns is cumbersome. it took me awhile to figure out where to sell excess load: the vending machines. which was after dropping bunch of poop guns. gun shooting is very awkward. it is neither fun nor satisfying to shoot. but the worst aspect of the game is its game balancing issue. it starts rough if not coarse with low damage, body brittle as fuck and extremely merger on supplies. after a while i got a halo-esq regenerating shield and that helped significantly, but i wished i had acquired the shield before having to fight on raw flesh and getting myself killed in the process. forced to pay insurance cost every time i die made the fight/the journey a penance. it made me feel so miserable. difficulty jumps up and spikes hard at the first boss 'nine toes'. according to reddit, 9tos seems to be the hardest part of the game, and then the difficulty curve seem to drop and hit the bottom somewhere after that. i say according to reddit because i quit playing the game and have no way to check them out. i wasted some time skimming through reddit to find a way to cheese 9 toes after dying a lot and it feels so lame because as clumsy or shallow as my play through might be, i wanted my first run done purely on my own, unless its a competitive game. anyway, after killing the dipshit using the exact tactics written and tested by forerunning borderland 𝘴𝘦𝘮𝘱𝘢𝘪𝘴, i stood by his corpse and noticed that it did not make me happy in any way. the un-fun outway the fun by miles.....light years even. i got so sick of it all and decided to jumped off the cliff and into the chasm to terminate myself without returning to the town. its not worth it. i then uninstalled the game and that made me feel a teeny weeny bit better. maybe that was the best moment i had with the game. no, i do not apologize for my lousy english. fuck that. fuck pandora. go play Sekiro and get yourself fucked several thousand times."
3028,Awesomesauce
3029,"Probably too overrated..maybe...
Even for my standard it still have something that seems off

The dlc is really great i mean a must have!!! It's so ridiculous that the dlc story is better than the main story in some way

Buy this on sale tho not really worth full price

8/10"
3030,The best epic shooting game ever!!!
3031,Hasn't aged as badly as you may think even know it's almost a decade old I still enjoy this title just as much as I did on Xbox 360 back in 2009. The cell shade graphics in my opinion is timeless and I cannot wait for Borderlands 3. 😯
3032,"'ve not found many (if any) times I've not enjoyed this game. 

storyline, aesthetic, gameplay, + expansion material all amazing!"
3033,Amazing...The OG looter shooter
3034,"I'm not sure why, but this game could never really keep my attention. Maybe it just doesn't feel visceral enough."
3035,"A game that defined a new and awsome genre with solid gameay and replayability with four great dlc to boast... But I must admit, after playing borderlands 2 this game feels just a bit stale (still edible)... A recommended experiance, esspeacialy in co-op... 9/10"
3036,"I loved this game and wasn't sure if I would at first.  It will make you laugh and it will make you cry, and even make you angry.
Overall a solid game.  One thing I really liked about this game is the First Person shooter mixed with an RPG setup."
3037,One of the most perfect games ever made ever.
3038,very good many weapon and gun
3039,"Wait... This game is 10 years old?
I bought this, played through it and didn't even find out until after that this game was made back in 2009. Cel shading makes a world of difference huh. It's not even that CPU intensive.

Gameplay is fun, but there's no way in hell I will remember what gun's good for what and all that since there are so many variations. I just use whatever I find best and sell the rest. The leveling is cool, never feels like a grind, and no two classes feel the same (even your stock standard Roland has skill diversity besides being just a regular soldier).

The co-op is a little buggy and broken but is still playable, and all quests are fun an quirky in some way or another (except those f*cking scavenging quests). As a Fallout fan as well as a fan of the Mad Max movies, this game felt right at home for me, and it's sadistic violent humour made it all the more fun. 

Seriously, pick it up if you are even remotely interested in Borderlands. I did and I'm not disappointed. 
Although some do say Borderlands 2 is better to start off with, I personally think starting at the beginning of a story is the way to go.

9.5/10 Still amazing in 2019, hasn't aged a bit."
3040,"Greetings, comrades! For once, I really don't know what to say about a game. This is one of those games where I wish they had that ""sideways thumb"" button, because I really don't think it deserves a ""good"" or ""bad"" label. It's sorta kinda just MEH, and here's why I feel that way.

The Pros:

The art style is nice and refreshing. It has that ""comic-book"" black cell-shading that's becoming common in games today, however it is one of the few that pulled it off with style.

The weapons are numerous (to say the least) and fun, and you'll find yourself building a set of weapons that you enjoy, with no one gun being above all the rest. There are better guns of different types, don't get me wrong, but if you find that a gun type just isn't your style, no biggie. Every RPG should take a note from that.

The enemies are not at all dumb, but they aren't smart either. They're in that range where if you let your guard down for one millisecond, you die, but if you keep sharp, you won't even get your shield broken, which could be a Pro or a Con, depending on your outlook on life. Also, they are well designed and satisfying to kill. Any game with head explosions is alright in my book!

The environments are very well done, and the attention to detail is amazing. You'd be surprised how much the little pile of garbage here, or the blood on the walls there makes the world come alive.

The voice acting is marvelous. After wandering the wastelands for hours, you'll be glad to hear your quest-giver or a vending machine speak to you in a voice that is unique and playful. Each voice isn't the same, and they really don't feel like your standard ""cookie cutter"" voices, so top marks here.

The Cons:

While everything in the game is unique, it still manages to be very “same-y”. It feels kind of like an MMO that tried to be single player/co-op. There’s quite a lot of grind, and the sheer volume of quests in a single area is enough to make even the most dedicated adventurer run for the exit.

The enemies are not at all dumb, but they aren't smart either. They're in that range where if you let your guard down for one millisecond, you die, but if you keep sharp, you won't even get your shield broken, which could be a Pro or a Con, depending on your outlook on life. Also, they are kind of “same-y”. Every bandit looks like Jason Voorhees at different stages of life, and the only type of variety the monsters show is that they look like they crashed into different aisles of the paint department.

The environments, while varied in substance, are generally bland despite the good art style. A lot of areas have many different defining features, but they all wind up having that same shade of brown dust covering everything in sight.

All in all, if you’re after a fun time-waster, and don’t mind it getting dry every now and again, give it a look!

Thanks for reading, and have an awesome day!"
3041,"Good, but for your money get Borderlands 2."
3042,this games title reminds me of the time my friend jumped the border to smuggle illegal drugs into the united states
3043,This is how you die / A spectacle of violence / Gorgeous and ugly.
3044,good game very addictive
3045,Not as good as the sequel but still an amazing game unlike any other that you can spend hours just looking for better guns.
3046,bdsm = beautiful day sunny morning
3047,Old but Gold
3048,Poor optimization. Screen tearing and dropped FPS. I shouldn't have to modify files in the game engine's direct file in order for the game to play well. Picked it up on a sale and still wouldn't recommend grabbing it on PC unless you are willing to spend the time to fine tune the game yourself.
3049,Fun game especially if your trying to get into games this one is a great start
3050,"I did not care for the lack of any really meaningful story, and my hours with the game were very boring. It felt like all I was doing was MMO style fetch quests, and non of the story lines really mattered that much. For years I've heard so much about this franchise, and I was very disappointed to discover that no matter how much I tried to like it it just was not fun in the slightest. This just wasn't the game for me I guess."
3051,gam good wecomends
3052,Piece of trash. Apart from grinding 3 different mobs there is nothing to do here.
3053,The first Borderlands is under rated :( May not be as good as its sequel but its still enjoyable . Though the FOV for this game is trash.
3054,"Played this game when i was pretty young quickly became one of my favourite games, but fuck me the FOV makes me want to die"
3055,I like it.
3056,The one that started all. Its much less complicated than the other 2 but sometimes simple is better
3057,Great Game!
3058,Not gonna add much with this review to the already existing ones. Just wanted to say that this is a fantastic looter shooter even after so many years passing by.
3059,"Possibly one of the most overrated games I’ve ever played.

Let’s start with the guns, arguably the most important aspect of this game, boasting almost over 17 million different guns to choose from, most of which will be useless to the player and on top of that, weapon proficiencies and classes just encourage you to never change the type of gun you use. Gunplay feels very weak, lined up shots often miss, all guns have an accuracy stat making every shot go off center to some degree and all bullets seem to be projectiles so even at point blank distances you can quite easily miss an enemy that is moving erratically.

Ok ok, it’s not about the guns.... It’s about the enemies! The 4-5 same enemy types throughout the whole game will blow you away with the variation of where their weakspot is and how most of them will just charge straight at you. Enemies respawn in areas that you have already cleared out making you feel like you are not accomplishing anything by killing them all, sometimes you can quite easily just run past them all several times throughout all the backtracking sections.

Ok so the guns and the enemies have no entertainment value, then it must be the story and setting? Quests consist of the filler quests you’d find in MMO’s to bulk them out. “Go here and kill X of this and then return” will be 90% of your gameplay. The gameplay matches the dry and boring setting. Such a great and unique artstyle is completely wasted on the dull and monotonous scenery. I couldn’t make it to the end of the game (due to the absolute misery it was causing me to feel) but I found out the ending is underwhelming and almost everyone disliked it.

It's pretty telling that only positive thing I hear people mention about this game is basically ""I enjoy this game because it requires so little brain power that I can just go into a trance and the game just plays itself so that I can switch off any cognitive functions and melt into my chair."" If that sounds like a product you want to experience, then knock yourself out I guess.

Rant over, don't make me regret enabling comments.

✔️Artstyle
✔️Music

❌Guns feels like crap
❌Boring repetitive gameplay
❌Never feel accomplishment for anything
❌Little variation in enemies
❌Uninspired quests
❌Endless grind to an unreachable goal
❌Unplayable without editing the game files (FOV)"

3062,"Apparently can't buy the third on Steam. Disappointing,"
3063,"This classic is still fun to play to this day, the comic style graffics have aged more gracegully then a lot of games of its time, combat is still crisp and tight. Story and characters still hold up well.

Great for the price, if on sale its a must buy.

I give this game a 9.5/10"
3064,"Most of the hype is around Borderlands 2 but honestly this is where it's at. It's simpler than the 2nd one but it feels like everything is much more thought out. The UI is clean and intuitive, the guns are interesting and unique and the story is lots of fun. Only thing is on PC the multiplayer was created to be done through gamespy which I've heard is awful so I haven't given it a shot. Also no way to do splitscreen co-op. If both of those were fixed it would go from 8/10 to 9.5/10"
3065,Must-play
3066,a great start in the franchise!

3071,more like BOREDlands
3072,sorry but anyone that dont like this game is  just wrong. this is one of the all time greats. its not the best but it is up there with the best. i think this game is worth twenty bucks all day long

3078,"I was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said, ""I never seen a man, who looks so all alone
And could you use a little company?
If you can pay the right price, your evening will be nice
But you can go and send me on my way""
I said, ""You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?""
She looked at me and this is what she said
Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good
Not even fifteen minutes later after walking down the street
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight
And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight
He said, ""Give me all you've got, I want your money not your life
But if you try to make a move I won't think twice""
I told him, ""You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask
What made you want to live this kind of life?""
He said
Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good
Well now a couple hours past and I was sitting in my house
The day was winding down and coming to an end
And so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend
I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same
Oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills
Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
We got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no we can't slow down, we can't hold back
Though you know we wish we could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good"
3079,"probably one of the best ""refund and buy borderlands 2"" simulators out there"
3080,Probably worth playing in multiplayer. But playing alone is boring and depressing. I uninstalled it after just a few hours.
3081,"Not a bad game, to be honest"
3082,"I do not usually write reviews, but I feel like this game deserves one.
I've started replaying this game, and, boy, it's far superior to a lot of nowadays games, even though it's an old one. The storyline it's interesting and quite unique, you've got lots of other stuff to do, other than the main quest, the characters are nicely built, a lot of the bosses are challenging and rewarding, thus making this game an enjoyable experience. 
If you didn't play the game yet, belive me, it's a must."
3083,"The original shoot and loot game in all of its glory. I actually prefer this one over the second game because of the way the weapons work, the second games projectile speeds are all so slow and its obvious in that game which guns are good. This is a great game to play co op with a friend."
3084,Good
3085,It's like Christmas!
3086,"Beaten on multiple platforms (Years Ago) including DLC

The Original Looter Shooter

Borderlands 1 was what feels like the original looter shooter and is a game where you and up to 3 friends choose classes and coop your way through and open world filled with quests, characters  things to shoot, and procedurally generated guns.  A lot of guns.

While i do recommend this game, it might be a bit outdated in terms of gameplay and mechanical improvements it's sequel/prequel has.  Still, it is a fun game that doesnt take itself seriously and is a fun game to play with a binch of friends

Pros:
- Different classes to choose from, that all play differently
- A long campaign with a lot of dlc to play through
- A ton of weapons (literally endless amounts)
- Fun coop
- Great sense of humor

Cons:
- Im not sure i would recommend playing the game solo.  It does scale but can be hard solo. 
- Some mechanics and such are improved on in later BL games, making this one feel outdated

An easy recommendation if you like looting and shooting."
3087,"(Disclaimer I’ve played Borderlands on the Xbox 360 so some knowledge is from that. On PC I played only one-character Mordecai because of sniper and revolver proficiencies boost)

Borderlands story had so much potential. All you are told is that a vault exists for you to open and you must make your way to it, that’s it. The ending is a disappointment (funny enough they mention that in the intro to Borderlands 2). I know people might question this and its mainly due to pacing. Through the story I was doing all optional quests and I only remember being told by the angel at Fyrestone I need to open the vault and get better equipped ""For the journey ahead"" and after all the gun play I remember going to a character called ""Tannis"" who knew of the vault's key and finally the ending where I was opening a vault. I imagine this is what most players can recall too.

However, I enjoyed looting weapons and finding better gear. I enjoyed doing the challenges, levelling up weapon proficiencies. Also found turning in multiple objectives at once to be satisfying (maybe I’m just weird).  Enemies felt unique and was never bored fighting them. Bosses were fun to fight, most memorable was Sledge and Krom.  There was never a class ability I hated, and levelling got addictive. 
This game is better in bursts don’t try to complete it in a day as you will burn yourself out.
Playing with friends is fun. However, the game works by “First come first serve” and will often test your willingness to give up information on what guns you got. 
Most likely scenario:/ Person 1 “Anything good in that loot box?” / Me “Nope all crap.” / Also Me *Turning into Gollum after finding a 461-damage revolver at level 29* /
As this is a looter/shooter, the shooting mechanics haven’t aged well. Not sure if it is due to me playing modern-day shooters. But I find that most headshots would miss 50% of the time because of hit boxes. Found myself shoving a sniper barrel down an enemy’s throat before it did any damage. It is an old game, so I just accepted it and moved on.

Overall, there was little to no story apart from the small pockets you were given on logs and quest acceptance or completion. Also, it does get tedious when you do a mission in an area then find out you got a new one to do there but that’s to be expected (This is when I found myself experience burnout). However, the looting is addictive and going through the game once you got a good weapon was fun. Given the games age I would still recommend getting this even for a solo experience.

(For those who don't like reading)

Story poor but fun.
Looting is amazing.
Guns look good and act unique.
Gun-play felt poor (Its an older game so I let it slide)
Great art style.
Some interesting characters and encounters.
Will test your friendships and your greed.
Can feel repetitive on objectives.
The game likes to throw enemy gauntlets at you.

Easily recommend if you can forgive the games age."
3088,"I wanted to like this. It's a gaming classic, is it not?

What I found was clunky and boring shooting. I couldn't get past the first hour.

What do people see in this? Am I just too late and the action is dated?

A dissapointment, for sure.

The sequel, on the other hand, was quite fun."
3089,"I learned my buddy in high school had depression while we played this game together. im a lot older now, and so is he. which is good.

2 out of 10 stars"
3090,Skip it and go to Borderlands 2 :)
3091,"I got about 1/3 of the way from what I can tell and got too frutrated by the AI, fast travel system, gear comparisons, boss battles coming down to me finding a way to cheese it, and more."
3092,nice looting simulator
3093,"it has guns, H E C C I N     G U N N Z"
3094,"Borderlands is one of my favorite games of all time. While I do tout the second as a better overall experience, I believe the first Borderlands is my favorite out of the series. It's a funny, dark, and lonely space-western with an insane amount of content for it's pricetag. You can't go wrong with Borderlands."
3095,Good game.
3096,This game is proof that all lands need borders and walls.
3097,:)
3098,"Still a very good game, even in 2019. i got this during a sale and i feel like i won the lottery with this.

i wish most games stand the testament of time like this game. It knows how to hook you in and keep you hooked and i'm enjoying the game very much.

Thank you for this, Gearbox and 2K."
3099,10 years later and its still one of the best games ever
3100,"Despite its age, Borderlands is still a lot of fun to play. Of course it doesn't look as clean cut as a lot of other games nowadays, but I would personally argue that that kind of also gives the game its charm. I'm personally not really a fan of shooter games normally, but Borderlands is the exception to that. The story has its silly and serious moments, and I admit that some of the enemy names have also made me chuckle.

Obviously you can also perform certain glitches and whatnot in the game, but what game doesn't have those? I personally also think it's fun trying to get them. 

While certain characters may have the ability to get stronger than others late game, it's fun to play with any of them, depending on your playstyle of choice.

It's pretty easy to lose track of time while playing, in my opinion. 

The game goes on sale often enough, so it won't be too hard to grab it and all the dlcs for a very nice price during a sale."
3101,"The friend that gifted me this game just leveled up to BFF cause this game is awesome!

Can't wait to try the other games in this series!!!!!!!!!"
3102,Classic looter shooter at this point still holds up well in 2019.
3103,One of the best games ever made
3104,"It's a fun game with friends, but by yourself if you're trying to 100% tick off every mission, it'll become repetitive, at least in 2 things felt faster paced, and thankfully they replaced the ""skill up mechanic"" with the medal system, because in BL1, reloading with guns at the start is very slow, and to make it better you need to keep using the weapon class you want to reload faster with. Other thing is, very absent soundtrack. On the positives, its very similar to its sequels (you know what I mean), and the gore is actually better than in BL2 and Pre-Sequel, they nerfed the deaths in the following games not sure why. 
Do I recommend it? Yes, but I'd say Finish the game, rather than Completing it, DLC's have their charm, with General Knoxx's being my favorite."
3105,Very good and addictive to play!
3106,"Guns, blood.... and oh did I mention more guns and blood?! It's fucking amazing man. You won't be let down
"
3107,10/10 would bang
3108,"can run on semi crap pcs very good story dont like the farming to much but its a classic game got all dlc along with game for 3$ it was 3$ worth it 
9/10"
3109,pieace of shit game not recomended
3110,8.7/10
3111,Will be a classic with the great titles.
3112,"So this will be an interesting one.... I found this game to have a really interesting story, and I found it fun to play for the most part. I can definitely see what all the hype was about. The only problem I have is that this game has not aged well at all. The controls are a bit clunky and the graphics are terrible. However, even though I personally would give this a 5/10, I would still recommend you give it a shot."
3113,The first time a game bored me to death but the second one at least had me playing it cause it was fun. But that one has some problems too but it's a step forward at least even it's a step forward is towards a land mine.
3114,"It is not bad, but it is too cartoonish for my taste. The gameplay is good though.

2,5/5"
3115,"I'm only 20 hours into Borderlands.  I don't know how much more of the game remains, but suffice to say that it definitely feels like it's still quite a lot.  I've explored one of the main locations, the Arid Desert or whatever it's called, pretty thoroughly, but there are at least four more areas to explore.

So, my point is that I haven't played much of this game, so feel free to take this game with a grain of salt.

In short though, I'm bored.  I've been feeling bored for the last few hours.  When I started playing I thought there would be some characterization, a narrative, maybe some further explanation about the ""Vault"" and other stuff.  But there's been nothing.  The game has been reminding me of the MMORPG style of fetch quests, where you're constantly given one after another after another fetch quest that feels largely pointless.  I thought maybe I just needed to stick with the game and it would get better . . .

But now that I'm reading the reviews, I see that it probably won't get better.  The cooler features and the rather crazy enemies aren't really enough to save it.

And I also own Borderlands 2 as well, so . . . on to that game instead."
3116,"i reccomend borderlands the pre-sequel or the second one bu this one is just as fun (but i enjoyed the other ones)
"
3117,"Borderlands holds up shockingly well a decade after release. The ""shoot and loot"" model is quite saturated today but this game holds a unique position of really pioneering these types of games. Gameplay is fluid and weapon variety is never ending. 
Where this game shows a bit of its age is the execution of the story. Most main mission briefings are just text with little to no voice acting support from its roster of eccentric characters. Side missions are also very inconsistent, they range from decent to redundant fetch/kill/push button quests with no interesting narrative context. This game, while can be solo played, is made to shine with co-op, so play with a friend every now and then if you can. 

TLDR: buy if you like shooting, looting, ability/stats points, cartoonishly vulgar characters, and Lilith. 
Actually just buy this game for Lilith."
3118,"I feel like this is a game worth your time, though requiring you to grind side quests for some areas so you can do relative amounts of damage to enemies. The level designs, characters and weapons are all fun and even more fun with 1-3 more friends as you explore this open world rpg. with that in mind though, some areas are a hit or miss when it comes to difficulty of quests and sometimes the loot ain't worth the time it took to complete. Gearbox makes up with it by providing you with good fucking loot nearing the end of the game and with some of the bosses in the forms of xp and weapons. And if im being honest i can't tell you anymore than to experience this game with a friend and see if its for you."
3119,timeless classic
3120,I like that you can shoot in this game
3121,classical
3122,Just fantastic!
3123,great game but im not good at it :(
3124,WORST BL EVER MADE
3125,"If you haven't bought and played this game, do so now. Also get the config editor so you can increase you're fov AND get rid of the trash mouse smoothing. 9/10 Better than borderlands 2 hands down."
3126,"""By installing and using the Software, you consent to the information collection and usage terms set forth in this section and Licensor's Privacy Policy, including (where applicable) (i) the transfer of any personal information and other information to Licensor, its affiliates, vendors, and business partners, and to certain other third parties, such as governmental authorities...""

3127,"The main game quite lacks on:

-story (dull, uninspired and bland as f*ck, additionally crappy final boss fight and even worse ending leave a sour taste, entire promise of being rewarded at the end with vault full of loot is a disappointing lie),

-characters (nothing interesting about them, just random guys sitting on chairs, talking pointless stuff and never do anything important in the story,
also lots of copy pasted mechanical jokesters),

-enemies (majority of them are just reskins with minimal changes, 
""ok this one deals fire damage but this one deal electric damage instead""),

-loot (majority of items and guns are just same thing but with very small different color, skins and slightly different magazine, rate of fire and damage, guns that actually have something unique about them will be soon outshined in damage by something that you will pick up a hour later anyway),

-bosses (boring fights, reskins of normal enemies with one or two new moves and they die in just few shots anyway so why even bother calling those boss fights?),

-missions (way too many ""go there and kill X"" 
or ""go there and pick up Y item"", 
you actually spend more times going on the mission and back than doing it),

-locations (mostly brown and grey, 70% desert, 25% caves, 5% snow),

but it's still an ""ok"" looter shooter for a game from 2009 and most importantly - it doesn't have bullcrap microtransactions. 
Just don't expect too much from it but as a first game in the franchise it can gets a pass.

For major highlights of the game I can easy point out vehicle combat (only with another player using mounted gun), second wind system, variety of loot categories, gunplay, coop and DLC's.

For major dislikes of the game it would be vehicle combat (without another player using mounted gun), very slow level up character progression, poor character customization, lack of listing multiple objectives on the map at once, way too long distances from point A to B especially while using vehicle, way too slow vehicle nitro recharge and confusing clusterf*ck that is fast travel screen which doesn't even show any information about locations or proper chronological order of them whatsoever.

Unfortunately you can see the low budget of this game all around the places, especially on how buggy this game is and low variety of main content.

Funny enough you can also see that they got money back while designing those DLC's because each one of them 4 are a bit better than whole main game, also more unique in majority of overall design and enemy variety. 
Each one of those DLC is a short and a bit grindy (if you want to do 100%) but with new unique missions, interesting characters and locations.
But then again you can see with Claptrap Revolution DLC that they did run out of money again because more than half of this DLC is about reusing assets from rest of the game (including other DLC's) - and not even in original or funny way.

Despite all that negative aspects of the game ""Borderlands: Game of the Year"" (main game + 4 DLC) is a good deal with -75% sale discount (around 5 euro) obviously. Just don't bother with this game if you are planning to play it solo. Yes, this is one of those games that are way, way less fun to play solo than in coop.

Funny enough Borderlands is a game from 2009 and has more content and variety than Anthem on day one which is a game with triple A budget published by EA in 2019.
Also Anthem was in development for 7 years by Bioware. Let that sink in for a second."
3128,"Great once I fixed Vsync problems by googling the problem and manually editing the WillowEngine.ini file by hand since the engine doesn't have an option for it? Anyway, if you can deal with any technical issues that come up, it's very good fun."
3129,"Borderlands is my favorite game of all time!
It is a RPG and FPS together with an incredibly good humour sense all along.
The graphics are cartoon like, you love it or hate it; I personaly love it!
The scenario is really cool, and between the main quests and the secondary quests, you never get bored!
It's the kind of game you can play for hours before to stop eventually for whatever.
I think it takes about 30h to finish it, so the lifespan is really good! And once it's done, you have a plus game possibility. And also you can play with 4 different characters, so finishing the game once with each at least, it's gonna take some of your time! :)
The highlight of this game is that you can play with up to 3 other players, and playing this game with friend is just awesome!
I totally recommend this game to everyone!"
3130,"Definitely no Borderlands 2, but still a great game in its own right"
3131,7.5/10
3132,"There ain't no rest for the wicked. For this game, that is still certainly true. If you like the cell-shaded graphics and enjoy a game that is out there, give Borderlands a shot. I originally got this on the 360 through games with Gold and thoroughly enjoyed it's style. It's what happens when George Miller takes acid with the cast of Monty Python, mixing together a Mad Max dystopia with outlandish characters that if nothing else are memorable. The weapon variety is expansive, with everything from flammable smgs to ice pistol. Gunplay still can be satisfying, with fighting game style numbers coming off the enemy every time you score a hit, along with getting criticals on headshots to watch the enemy's head explode into a million pieces (that said, I feel the bloody mess perk in Fallout 3 and New Vegas is a little more funny)."
3133,Loved it!!!
3134,.
3135,BEST GAME EVER!!!!
3136,gooood 9/10
3137,"This is a great game. The gameplay can keep me hooked for hours on top of hours (although this shows i only have a few i've had it on console). The graphics while not the best can hold their own. My only criticism not regarding  the story is the loot system. While not often but still repetitive i've received loot up to twice my level so i would have to wait ages to be able to use that loot (ex. i was level 12 and got 2 level 25 weapons, a smg and combat rifle). 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My overall reveiw scores are...

Gameplay        9/10

Graphics          7/10

Porgression    4/10"
3138,oh boi just buy bl2 and if u have already played bl2 then play it again ..and again but not this piece of shit
3139,boring
3140,a long and engaging story that builds up but then turns into some hentai gone wrong at the end
3141,"Funny game,at the start it was a little boriing  to farm Level but as the time goes on it was more and more fun,gameplay is cool,except driving and  camera movment when im knockout....All together game is good,worth playing

10/10"
3142,"I have too much playtime on this game...
But it's really fun, especially with friends but even without. This is clearly not as polished as Borderlands 2, but it's clearly worth the time. The gameplay is a bit rigid and the accuracy is absolutely terrible even when using 97+ weaponry, the storyline is clearly not very original (but still interesting & all) but it's got tons of hours to waste on guilt-free in the end.
You can run this on a toaster, but the PC port was rushed, so do NOT put this on the highest settings, you will get crashes. 
Gameplay-wise, it's a story-driven looter shooter RPG, with an excellent weapon variety and overall balance even though some weapons are more powerful than others.

If you can get this cheap with a few friends, you're gonna have a great time."
3143,"What a nostalgia trip, i remember playing the crap out of this game for HOURS on end. I had a blast with this game"
3144,"Easily one of the best games ever made.  While it was actually blown out of the water by its own sequel, Borderlands 2, the original is still a ton of fun and worth going back to play alone or with friends any time.  Fantastic."
3145,10/10 better than the pre sequel
3146,"Borderlands GotY Edition (Main + 4 DLCs)

Pro
+ tons of weapon to loot with different stats & effects
+ western & apocalyptic setting
+ funny NPC's (main + DLC)
+ skills are fun

Neutral
cel-shading comic graphic
not so much environmental variation

Negative
- story is very boring
- soundtrack was annoying
- Moxxi's Underdome DLC

Conclusion: Borderlands GotY Edition is good game that I can recommand with a doubt. Gameplay over story is the slogan for this game."
3147,Boring
3148,you ever have that feeling that you wanna steal your dads truck and ram it into a preschool. well thats what playing this game feels like
3149,"[h1]Shoutout to my friend Hoominoidtyphoon for getting me the Steam version of this game. I may have some nostalgia here, be warned. Remember, think your own thoughts. Come to your own conclusions.[/h1] As for myself, I feel that this game was a wonderful masterpiece when it first released and is a mighty powerful game to lose yourself in to this day. This game is one of the grandfathers of the shooter RPG genre and continues to be so to this day. I remember when I first got my copy of this game on the Xbox 360 as it was handed to me in the backseat of my mother's car after being picked up from elementary school back in 2010. Like any game back then I cherished the game and read the back of the box, savored every piece of it in my hands. When I first played it, it felt like a world with no end and a universe had just been opened for me. The characters, the progression, the enemies, the quests, and of course, the guns. All of this had dogpiled into one of the most satisfying experiences of the time and playing it now has only hearkened back to those simpler times of glory and satisfaction in games that no other can match. This is simply the only way I can describe this piece of media. However, I will attempt to be more technical in my explanation of it now, but I feel that I must preface my review with those previous sentiments.

Now, with that out of the way, onto the main show of the game, [b]the guns[/b]! Of course there exists a great variation of weapons for you to choose from. However, they can generally be classified into 6 categories: Pistols, Revolvers, Assault Rifles, SMGs, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, Rocket Launchers, and Eridian Weapons. As you use these weapons, they will level up proficiency stats according to the category they're in. This will, in turn, make all of the weapons in the same category much more powerful. Moreover on progression, once you reach a standard XP threshold, you will level up. Each level up will give you a token to spend on your character's skill tree of which there is one for each of the 4 unique characters, each with their own unique ability. Other mechanics in place, like inventory slots for weapons and elemental artifacts server to extend your level of customization possible in the game, as well as making yourself more powerful. Getting back to the guns, there is a rarity system in use for the guns in the game. This was before lootboxes, so the main use of the rarity is to tell you how useful or valuable the weapon is. This allows you to quickly gauge how effective a weapon will be against an enemy. In addition, it is important to know that, as was common in this era of RPGs, you can expect to grind alot in order to gain experience and progress in the game. This also gives you the opportunity to find new weapons randomly generated from defeated enemies. The game follows an RPG route of giving story through characters who function, essentially, as questgivers. You get the quest, you do the quest, you get money, guns, and XP. Sound good, yea? However, what separates this from your average RPG is that the characters are just that, CHARACTERS. They have personality that makes them anything from lovably adorable to horribly sadistic. It's not so much their actions or backstory as it is their presentation, especially when they are first introduced. This game also functions as a sandbox so you can go back to any point in the game and kill all the baddies that you had defeated before but for newer weapons this time along with that good ol' XP. If there are two things that can be said about this game, it's that the ending is infamous for being disappointing, so just be warned, and you must buy the GOTY edition if you plan to stay long. This is due to a raised level cap, new maps, enemies, quests, and guns all included in the various DLCs. All in all, I'd say that this game was revolutionary for the time and continues to be a great joy to play to this day. Definitely pick it up if you want to have a new experience in gaming!"
3150,"This game is a lot of fun and can entertain for a long time. 
"
3151,"Borderlands was and still is an amazing game. 

As much as I love this game it has many problems such as boring mid game and robot like movement in cut scenes. other than that borderlands was a great way to get gearbox their deserved attention"
3152,"an awsome game, i loved the game on console but it doesn't compare to how smooth it is on pc. a great buy"
3153,"10/10 Love for this game! The glitches,gameplay, customization, and exploration of the game is amazing. Played it on 360 when it out and played it to hell and back. Countless hours of fun on this amazing series! Will always be a fan and cant wait to see Borderlands 3! Now onto 2! 

P.s. Love the easter eggs. Favorite easter egg was the Shaggy and the mystery bus in the zombie dlc. It was an audio log."
3154,I went into the game not knowing exactly what to expect about this shooter. I got everything I wanted and more and things I didnt know I wanted like all the crazy and funny characters. 10/10
3155,Yes
3156,Awesome game must play like stupid gun's stupid enemies and it just runs on the desire to get more guns and the game get very chaotic especially in co-op if you can pick this u[ cheap then id recommend a play and if you already own it buy it for your friend so that they can join in on the mayhem that is know as borderland 2 :) (Must Play)
3157,"Actual good game.

I recommend this game because it’s like when I had an Xbox 360 and I would play halo 3

This game is basically the pc version of halo 3 

Best game in the borderlands franchise"
3158,best one out of the series
3159,BL2 is better but it's still fun to play.
3160,"Classic Borderlands in all of it's glory...

I found this game very enjoyable and to be honest it has aged well depsite a few performance issues now and again. The DLC is fun and I find the game replayable to a point where I might play through this game again because it almost has a nostalgia factor to it.

All in all, it's a must buy RPG game."
3161,"Ok, so funny in some places and so boring in others... sooo boring.  How many times do I have to do kill the same crappy monsters over and over and over again.

I loved the jokes tossed in about so-and-so not being your friend etc, but then again, some of the missions were so much a copy & paste of others that I really was hoping for some more story etc.

Play if you like FPS, if you're looking for an RPG... you'll like something like Shadow of Mordor or Final Fantasy a lot more."
3162,"from start to finish, my grades were sawed in half, 10/10"
3163,"I love this game. It has many interesting characters and it also helps to understand many things that happened in the later games (""Borderlands 2"", ""The Pre-Sequel"" and ""Tales from the Borderlands""). The main story isn't too long, it takes around 40-50h to beat the game depending on how many sidequests you complete but it has a huge replay value. I've finished the game 4 times and I'm still playing it because there is still a lot of stuff to do after finishing the game, like playing the DLC.
If you aren't sure if this is a game for you, I recommend playing Borderlands 2 first because this is a better game for people who never played a Borderlands game."
3164,"Love the game, classic BL."
3165,"Worse than Borderlands 2, the humour is like Guardians of the Galaxy if you're into that. Gunplay is horrific and leveling up when playing solo can be especially tedious. I never played this with friends, but I did play 2 with friends so my review might be a bit biased.

If you're considering purchasing this and don't own the second, buy the second."
3166,"I love this game so much. I played and beat it with every character across both console and PC, because I'm kind of obsessive like that. I loved the second one even more than this one (which is saying something) and highly recommend that one too."
3167,It's an overall great game and I think everybody should atleast give this one a try.
3168,Don't play it.
3169,"Some of the most satisfying shooting I've ever experienced.
Watching enemies' heads explode never gets old."
3170,yes
3171,"This is one of those games that has a really slow start, but the more you put into the game, the more you get out of the game. It will feel tedious at first, but it gets really good as you play in both story and gameplay. 
Also it has some of the most worthwhile DLCs to ever exist, which is saying a lot, since I really hate the concept of DLCs in general.







































[spoiler] I hate you ClapTrap! [/spoiler]"
3172,"Do yourself a favor and just play Borderlands 2. 

I had a fun time with the original Borderlands when I played it years ago, but coming back to it now it just feels grindy and less enjoyable than its sequel. Of course you would expect the series to improve, but the fact of the matter is the story here is very bare bones and there isn't anything you get in this game that isn't done better in the second game.

If you are looking for a co-op RPG shooter and had your fill over Borderlands 2 already, you can give this a shot, but personally, I was ready to wrap up my playthrough quickly and move on."
3173,"Late to the party on this game but it fully holds its own even against 2018 triple A games. Really fun, graphics are interesting and pretty cool and its really funny. Great for Coop, it really couldn't be better for that mode. No complaints. Super fun"
3174,Aged surprisingly well
3175,"It's Borderlands. What else can i say? 


Well, ok. All DLC are worth to buy too.....That's all. Go buy this game and play it."
3176,Serious fun.
3177,"still playable and fun under win10.  if you love bl2, play this.

ps, love the prof levels for weapon types, increases damage and other stats as you use the weapon type more... BL2 should have this."
3178,"It's 2019 and this game is still FUN and RELEVANT.
One of the best games ever devised in my opinion.
"
3179,Honestly in the year 2019 and being new to the gamd it's still good tbh
3180,"Borderlands is a classic shoot and loot style game.  You pick one of four classes and search the planet of Pandora for the legendary vault, which will supposedly bring our heroes wealth, power and fame.  You can play it solo or have up to three people join you on your quest.  There are many interesting characters in Borderlands and several unique enemies to fight.  The environments do feel very similar throughout the game since they are mostly variations of deserts and rocks.  You’ll primarily be in large open desert areas, shanty towns, and junk yards.  Some of the areas are very large and require a vehicle to explore but the vehicles in the games are so easily destroyed by the enemies and they handle extremely poorly.  There are lots of weapons and loot items to discover while playing so you’ll be rewarded for exploring but most of them can be found on top of a house or behind a table.  The story in the main game revolves around finding the vault and helping the different people you meet with different tasks like collecting items and fighting different bosses.  Most of the bosses drop rare and unique weapons and most side quests reward you with unique weapons as well.  The only problem is that the main story can begin to feel dry after a while.  The middle of the game revolves around going to a new area and killing a boss and can feel repetitive after a while but the game really comes to life at the end.
Where the game really excels is in the DLCs.  The stories in the DLCs are not as serious in the main game and are more funny and lively.  They take more risks in them and it really pays off in its uniqueness and helps the game stand out.
Overall Borderlands is a solid game.  It is enjoyable to play either alone or with other players.  If you plan on getting it I recommend getting it with the DLC since it adds so much more to the base game.  It does have its weird gameplay moments and occasional cheap death, but nothing that’s really a deal breaker.

3181,Fun game.Try to play the game with friends in co-op.Is more fun then in solo mode.
3182,This is by far the most boring FPS in existence
3183,"Just finished a marine playthrough , did some side questing , all in all had fun during all the hours I played it.
Lot of guns and loot to choose from(most is only good to sell and make money) , graphics are unique also.
Basically if you like to shoot and loot I think you will like this game :)"
3184,Was ok at first but got really boring and repetitave at about level 20... read online that borderlands 2 is much better and you dont need to playthrough #1 to play it. So for that reason I wouldnt reccomend this game and to just go buy #2
3185,"""Hello traveler there's new missions available at some random's place bounty board""


Just make sure to pick all the missions so you don't go crazy :)"
3186,So basically we don't need to buy this game. An activator can activate this game and keep it forever in your library. I have to admit that this is a good game. I've enjoyed the full Borderland 2 experience on my brother's account but [b]this game is poorly optimized to run on older PC although it was released long time ago.[/b]
3187,"E

Edit: Now i recommend it bc I actually enjoy this game a fuck-ton and I just not recommend just bc i could lol"
3188,"Great game! I was playing it for almost a years (maybe two) and it makes me realise how I hate the fact that I misted on it when it just came out. I would play it with pals till my fingers break. I love the balance between serious and comidic elements. It doesnt try to look goofy or step outside real of realism with it's humore (mayb eit does a bit in some DLCs). Guns are fun but I dont liek the combat rifles in this games, I only use them as the last resort. Also rocket launchers behave weirdly and somehow enemies deal real damage with it to you while you have to aim to the ground next to enemies.

In short the game isnt perfect but scores high points in 'fun' category."
3189,"PURE SATISFACTION. WANT LOOT? WANT EXPLOSIONS? WANT NO CINEMATIC CUTSCENES UNTIL THE END OF THE GAME? GET IT NOW I DONT CARE IF ITS 2019! GET IT F*cking NOW YOU WONT REGRET IT. BUT THERES SOME LEFT OUT THINGS. BUT WHO THE F*CK CARES! ITS ACTION IS EXTREME! THIS BETTER HAVE BEEN HELPFUL AND ADVERTISED YOU TO GET IT!
-MR.TORGUE"
3190,"It's not as fun as Borderlands 2. A bit repetitive. The main storyline is kind of shallow. 

However for me who wants to play a series from the start until the end, going 2-3 missions at a time is good. Shooting all the creatures and jumping to get an item is kind of relaxing."
3191,Best looter-shooter on the market
3192,I love Borderlands. I have played too much of this game on all consoles but I always see myself comming back and enjoying the hell out of it. Both 1 and 2
3193,"This is a fun, action-packed adventure on a unique world that oozes with style.  The controls are tight, the enemies somewhat diverse, and the story (unlike many RPG's) doesn't get lost amongst the side-quests.  The story itself is humorous (while not on the level of Portal) it is quirky and doesn't take itself too seriously.  Expect sophomoric jokes and absurdity over witty banter.

The game (if you've hidden under a rock you may not know this) is a FPS looter-shooter with RPG elements.  You have only one primary active skill per class (with bare bones character modification), but many passive skills that support both your active skill and your play in general.

While the weapons seem limited in scope and artificially restrained in power as the characters progress along their skill trees, increasing the power by proxie, the scope of a looter in an FPS was somewhat revolutionary at the time.  I'm sure somewhere there exists a title that did it first (lost to obscurity), or references to Elder Scrolls (which I would argue is not an FPS RPG, but an RPG that has the option of a first person perspective (an FPP if you will)) might be contrary to this opinion.  There is no doubt that it is the first mainstream and widely commercially successful blend of the genres.

They took care to balance power in the world relative to character progression and world region (enemies you can easily mow down are worthless in experience making them worthless to mow down except to farm for money (which stronger enemies produce faster and easier anyway)).  The caveat is that there are a few situations where (especially noticable in boss battles) you are put at a distinct disadvantage and there is a difficulty spike.  Also in new regions, there is a drastic increase in costs (balanced by bigger value loot drops behind the scenes) Even this is done in measure, but does allow for an illusion of difficulty while providing a generally easy, mainstream game.

By all measures, this is a good game.  I've enjoyed almost every minute (one DLC being the exception).  My biggest gripe is that you can't skip cutscenes.  I think I'd appreciate more variety in weapons, (as the majority of the ""looter"" half of the gameplay becomes ""pick it up to sell it"" very quickly) but upon consideration the RNG of the modifiers and damagae outputs does give you the ""golden catch"" rush when you find a truly extraordinary weapon amongst guns that become part of the background noise.

So buy it if you haven't.  Play it with friends and argue over who gets the new sniper rifle. And enjoy the experience.  Even my friend who gets motion sick playing FPS games can play this without difficulty.  You will likely have a fun time."
3194,"Amazing game, Loved every single moment playing it since it came out on the PS3 and now I get to relive it, I want to see more from these guys that is similar to this game. Please make more if you are able to, nothing but praise for this game. It was my childhood growing up and seeing it on Steam makes it even better for me."
3195,"Worth every penny!!
Stuck so many times with the car and hilarious physics.
Other than the fov and locked fps (that you can change in the config files) it's a pretty good game.
Deserved a GoTY and got it."
3196,the game that i hated at first but loved after few moments. i was blazed so many times by this game
3197,10/8.5
3198,shoot the bad guys
3199,This game is the best  I like all  gearbox games like this game 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
3200,"Boarderlands is amazing! I love this game, after playing it for almost a week stright on with my cousin in his PS3 I realized that I NEEDED this game. So when it went on sale I bought it and I don't regret it. The graphics are low enough to play on most computers but high enough to be pretty.

The storyline and characters are awesome, I love how creative and diffrent the story is compaired to other games I've played. 
I give this game two thumbs up!"
3201,So much time can be sunk into this game. Really fun for co-op but can be played in full on single player as well.
3202,"Unrefined Borderlands - stupid AI, geodata bugs.

But it has that ..... post-apocalyptic flavor that BL2 doesnt have.

Overall - least crazy Borderlands."
3203,In my opinion - the best part of the Borderlands franchise.
3204,"This game is awesome!
Only problem is no auto ammo and health pick up, no minimap i almost lost every time when i do my quest, and the unskipable cutscenes every time i start the game is so annoying i have to go eat something before i even start a game."
3205,"It has that good ol' raw fps feeling, I like it very much."
3206,"Recieved as a gift from a friend,

the art style is cartoony but it grows on you. Overall pretty fun and makes me interested in the newer games which I havent touched yet. Can say this game is great though"
3207,"8.5/10, I highly recomend this game to anyone who likes fps games and also the loot and mission aspects of rpgs. There are something like 10 million different guns which are generated by a system that combines different parts, elements, and manufacturers, all of which define the characteristics of the weapon. But thats just the loot aspect of the game, in the case of the story, I would say its somewhat lacking. While there are loveable and memorable characters like claptrap, Id have to say that in general the story feels vary empty and baron, which I suppose fits the theme of the game. There are four different classes which each have unique skill trees and abilities, and they have proficiencies with certain weapon types. The game is most fun with one to three other freinds, but it is plenty of fun solo aswell. I have much more time than this, probably closer to 500 hours, but its all on ps3. The dlc for this game is the definition of dlc done right. It isnt new  cosmetics, weapon skins, or animations, its more content, more missions more guns and more adventures. The games asthetic as mentioned before is very baron, which differes from the second games, which feels very populated compared to this one, where you will drive for 3 minutes through the dessert, only with the occasional skag or bandit to shoot at you on your way to your destination. That can be good or bad depending on who you are, but that isnt to say that there is a lack of action, theres just some times where you have to travel to get to it. So I would say that this game is amazing, and that Borderlands 2 is a borderline masterpeice. If you had to get one you should get the second one, but if this ones on sale, or if youve got the money, than get Borderlands 1, it will be worth your time and money if you enjoy fps and rpg games."
3208,"Underrated game. I don't know why so many people skip this one and just play 2, it's a really good dumb fun FPS game."
3209,Very good
3210,Legendary game.
3211,is rlly gud
3212,"The PC port has loads of unacceptable tech issues. Which is odd because the graphic options are almost all there, but AA, vsync, and windowed/fullscreen options are missing (ctrl+ enter still works, but no native borderless windowed). The sliders are pitiful, which is even worse if you feel like your sensitivity is too high even at the lowest level. The volume sliders are the worst offender. There are only two relevant sliders; music and sound. Don't try moving the voice volume slider thats for multiplayer. Sounds in game are either too quiet or WAY TOO DAMN LOUD. Without more presice sliders and the ability to tweak specific sounds, it got to the point to where I just muted the game entirely.

Quests are layed out in an obnoxious mmo matter where there is a ton of wasted time backtracking. More noticeably, they're generic and feel empty due to the lack of narritive spam (both good and bad) in comparison to the 2nd game.

Lastly the DLC is very mediocre and forgettable. Zombie Island by far gave me the worse experience, especially with the quests. It contains a multistage fetchquest, with constant backtracking and literally no relevant reward.

It's not really worth playing this at all, the sequal fixes and improves a lot of the issues. Get it instead of this."
3213,This is the best game I have ever played.
3214,"Boring as hell. I need to force myself to play iot, one mission at the time. Compared to the latest games, the missions are so meaninghless. Find 2 lost rifle parts in a row, kill some badass animal, kill more animals at the Arena. Are you serious? You need xp to get to know the plot but side missions are just... what is this. Meeehhh. 

The humor? Where? 
Great characters? Well, maybe? Idk, I don't see 'em.
The universe? Tbh? I'm not impressed. Again, boring.

BL2 & BL:TPS are more interesting. Don't waste your time, get your lore from the internet & go be Handsome Jack's best frenemy."
3215,"Great game.  I like Boderlands 2 better for the additional content, but this is a great game"
3216,a classic a classic a classic
3217,"As a person who had absolutely no experience with first person shooters before playing this game, it was great! I would imagine people enjoy this game for a variety of reasons."
3218,"Still love to come back to this game every now and again. One of the best co-op shooters in a while imo. The classes all felt unique even if some were more overpowered than others and class mods added vareity to each of them.  Gunplay was satisfying especially if you got lucky enough to stumble across a legendary while farming mobs. That being said, I would have loved to see gear sets like Diablo or The Division. It could have added much more replayabilty after beating the game. The wasn't much of a story to speak of either but has a very post-apocaylspe vibe to it, something I think was lacking from BL2.  Also had issues with hitbox detection, terribly placed invisible walls, and textures that didn't age very well, but even with those problems it was still one of my all time favorite games to play. 8/10"
3219,"Finished the achievements 100% so I'll make a review while doing my 2nd Playthough on DLC's 

Pros:
The game is a classic masterpiece
Buy the Game of The Year Edition to maximize your gameplay 
Enjoyable with friends
Shoot and Loot

Slight Cons:
Achievement Collection probably the Underdome and Crawmerax (will need friends to complete this fast), the RNG problem on the Claptrap Item Drops (might take hours)"
3220,"In the first place I was quite sceptical about Borderlands. But it immedeately won me over when I first played it. 

It is a solid shooter for single as well as cooperative multiplayer use. The comicstyle graphics fit very well into the whole concept with its satirical approach.  For me it has just enough free world elements to not feel too restrained on a level path. At least at the beginning it is not as ""roaming free"" as e.g. Fallout but you have hands full of challenges anyway. Later on you have more freedom especially to return to some ""low level"" areas for some recreational weapons practice.

Operating is easy enough for also some casual playing. Challenges, puzzles and bosses still make for lots of action. Skill developement as well as weaponary fit quite well into the overall picture.

On the whole a lot of fun and definitely worthwhile. It also lead me to follow up on Borderlands 2 and Borderlands the Presequel."
3221,Fun game as a mercenary
3222,A must play. One of the best co-op shooters out there.
3223,Best of the series
3224,8/10
3225,I really like this game. I'm writing this review because I  need it for a steam badge.
3226,Yes
3227,"If you haven't already heard about Borderlands, you're missing out. It's a great FPS that plays a bit with the RPG idea (i.e. skill trees, exp, etc.) I love the drop-in whenever co-op. As great as this game is, I highly suggest playing the second one instead. It vastly improves on this formula and the overall experience is so much better. I would only reccomend purchasing this if it came in a bundle. That being said, the game is great and tons of fun, especially if you have the DLC!"
3228,8/10
3229,"I'm playing it for the first time in the end of 2019.
It's original, but very fast get me bored. Can handle only for little more then a half game. Will try borderlands 2, hopes it way better."
3230,one of the best games i have played
3231,"Played it through solo and then with one or two others and loved it both times. Highly recommend for both. 
The humour is the best part! ALL the guns."
3232,how do i set up split screen for Borderlands plz help me
3233,"I played this game in 2010 on an xbox 360 for the first time for perspective at 30 fps on a cctv that was about 30 inches wide. Now im playing it for the first time since then on my pc and it looks absolutely amazing, to me its almost as good as my console experience with borderlands 2 graphically. It still holds up to this day in my opinion and as a long running fan i can say if anyone out there played this on last gen consoles and now has a pc you will not regret picking this up. And for anyone who played the 2nd or the presequel first, give this one a solid try, get your friends together and go down the nostalgia rabbit hole and if you dont enjoy the game then comment on my post and tell me what you dont like about it. Personally i dont like having to individually pick up the ammo and cash but they added a group collection system in the 2nd one."
3234,"Borderlands one old good game in which i had fun while playing it,i would suggest to all people who love postapolyptic fps games,it has good story,weapons,characters everything it's one good game made by 2K and Gearbox corporation,one Yes for me :D."
3235,pretty good game
3236,"This is a tentative recommendation and it comes with a few possible outcomes for you.

In short, I feel that this game is quite too long, its quests ultimately too repetitive and grindy, and the whole of its content stretched way too far to cover the size of the game underneath. The microcosm gameplay of shooting up a camp of enemies and running around and looting the aftermath, however, is a compact joyful blast.

In essence, you zip around the world with nearly flawless control and game fluidity, shooting and maiming and blowing up the world's unsavory denizens - the vast majority of living things in the game. There aren't too many types of these enemies, many are effective palette swaps of others, and they're not particularly bright, but there are lots of them and they hit fairly hard. They explode into an almost unmanageable confetti of reward items; consumables, money, and random equipment generated within the familiar color code rarity system. Even with the maximum of carrying capacity expansion, it would be a fool's errand to play packrat and try to capitalize for every last dollar with these items. It's a bounty to sift through with purpose.
Sometimes, this is all done within the context of a specific quest, and the terms of gameplay really don't change much in those cases. Quests are not designs of nuance or much interest. Shoot this, bring back this, and little else.

In all, your interaction with the world is about as limited as the quests. Few neutral or friendly NPCs that there are, a meager fraction of them can really be spoken to to any effect, and none do much at all, ever. There's not a lot to do with the world besides jump on it or trade with it. It's a monster box full of piñatas.

Leveling up is satisfying when it happens, but to play with the aim of leveling becomes a ponderous and unrewarding grind a short way into your game. To max a character, levels, individual stats and weapon category expertise, I couldn't even imagine the slog. Surely, someone has done the numbers on this and produced some efficiency guide, the very existence of which tells the story as I read it. And thus we mark the real downfall of the game.

I loved the first however many hours of the game, and then, upon discovering limitations and repetitions of ideas, the returns diminished greatly. By my exhaustive and thorough finish of this game, and all of its DLC, as I had purchased them together, I was just TIRED. Having kicked through the opening area of this game, I had a projective excitement to get to Borderlands 2, and any other games. It's been a long while, months or maybe even years, since I finished this game, and I still feel an awful distaste for the prospect of jumping into any more of this. Your mileage absolutely will vary.

Now, given price bundling and various game editions, my thus recommended course is probably the least money-efficient way to address this series, but alas - I recommend just trying this base game, then moving on to DLC and other games a la carte. Play it all the way through, see if you've still got an appetite for it. Take the DLC one by one, and just dose until you can't stand it anymore. 

The visual and audio presentations are stylish and nice. Little need be said.

Concerning the rest of the presentation, the story is utterly negligible and uninteresting - the fact that there's a telltale series based on this franchise is beyond me. Thankfully, it's hardly the point of the game.

The touted humor is by and large a regrettable dud. It's about what you would expect from something stewed up in gamer/internet culture. That comparison doesn't bear for the actual character of the humor - it's not made of memes, to say - but rather the quality. Not good. It reached a point at which continued interaction with any character became directly proportional to my displeasure with that character - player character included. The quips are just not funny, and the tone of it is limited and irritatingly soaked in cartoon sarcasm.

It's serious fun to play one (wo)man army. It is. And then, at some point, passing through the same areas and enemy layouts for the 50th time (perhaps an understatement, actually), it stops being so much fun. And then there's still heaps of these games left, all kind of existing as a blurred continuum of ""more THIS"". A lot of people wholeheartedly recommend the second game over this one. I haven't played it to lend an opinion, but field that option as well. Bite off what you can stomach, either way."
3237,Purty Gud
3238,Best Sale. Still holds ups after many years. have to be fair it does take time to get the right specs down in the video game setting but looks and play great once you get it right.
3239,great stuff!
3240,The start of the vault hunting ^^
3241,borderlands is simple and funny to play with your friends. Come see this amazing game around the centuries!
3242,Been playing this game nearly all day everyday for 2 weeks and still haven't clocked it and still not bored of it
3243,Old but gold. Love it!
3244,"Dropped out of the bed,  planted a granade into the shitter, grabbed booze money from my fridge, remember the booze guy went the heming way, instead knocked over some bandids, stole their gas to fuel my generator so i could play some borderlands.
time of my life"
3245,"What a wicked deal right now for $7, you get this game?

Having never played the Borderlands games in its entirety, I knew I had to play them in chronological order  (Borderlands 1, Pre-Sequel, Borderlands 2, Tales of the Borderlands) 

This first game is a ton of fun, but the quality really shows. I got used to it, but Im sure it was ahead of its time when it was first released. DLC is worth it. As a Casual player, I had a blast. 

Now having completed this game and the Pre-Sequel. It's time to move on to Borderlands 2."
3246,CATCH A RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII...
3247,A golden-oldy but still awesome game that resisted aging. It’s still fun to play coop and the humor is excellent.
3248,"This game really isn't as good as the second one. I have to say, sure, it's a decent game standalone, however there is just not enough things for me to do, and the game is too slow for me to have a fun.

Get the second one, since you won't miss out on much if you skip this one."
3249,"Okay single-player and the humor isn't as painfully try-hard as succeeding entries. Most firearms you will find aren't good enough to warrant exchanging for what you already possess, tending towards single digits of difference in percentage. Get it on sale, get some friends, get trashed."
3250,"I have no sound what so ever in any of the games, and I have uninstalled them and reinstalled. So far, having a bad time. I love the games, but now do not have an console and bought them on PC, just only having issues that make me not want to play."
3251,"Game is great, great story gotta play the second one and dont forget about the pre-sequal :) <3"
3252,"Haven't played this game much (despite what my hours say) but I can say it's a better experience with friends. Though, I have a few problems with the engine, i.e. FOV, anti-aliasing (forced), problems with registering completed missions on LAN and a few more I can't recall now."
3253,"Borderlands is an amazing game. Honestly I could go on about it.

I first started off with Borderlands 2, but the first game has a nostalgic feeling to it that I can't quite place.

The game has good jokes, cool bosses and enemies, and a pretty damn good plot line too. The Borderlands franchise is what introduced me to FPS games and I'm really glad it did.

I highly recommend this game."
3254,Ouija demon approved.
3255,"Borderlands is a large, open world first person shooter with slight RPG elements and has a heavy focus on loot grinding and co-op play that was released in 2009. It’s fun and immersive gameplay, great soundtrack (and marketing videos), distinct visual style and co-op mode makes it a highly recommended game to play, even after all these years. Its success is partially the reason why Aliens: Colonial Marines turned into such a flop, as resources were diverted from that game to focus on Borderlands sequel. If you had to only play one of the Borderlands games, I personally would recommend the second one as it expands on what makes this game great in nearly every way, but this is still worth playing if you can handle the older graphics.
 
You play as one of the unique vault hunters, a mercenary type drawn to Pandora to find the mysterious vault and unlock its riches. The planet which was previous colonized by the Mega Corp Dahl to exploit its resources has been attacked by the Crimson Lance under orders from Atlas, freeing all the slave and convict labor and adding an extra layer of hardship to the surviving colonists as they fend off wildlife and bandit attacks. The story follows your adventures from hoping off the bus (where you pick your character) and saving the town right to opening the vault at the end, meeting lots of interesting characters (and killing a few of them).
 
Gameplay is primarily FPS based. That said it is unique for each of the 4 characters, as their bonuses and skills trees vary quite widely and don’t overlap with each other. As far as playstyles go, you have a sniper class (focuses on long range attacks), a melee class (focuses on punching things), a standard solider class (bonus to all guns) and a siren class (bonuses to elemental damage). While shooting is going to be how you kill majority of things, the special skills are what makes the game fun, and depending on class allowing you to pop turrets that can fire at enemies and heal, summoning a bird that can attack, going into a berserk state for high damage buffs and reduced taken damage, or the ability to go invisible and gain a high speed boost. Being able to join others games up to 4 players is really enjoyable– the loot drops are better and it also increases the enemy’s levels to make it more of a challenge. There are 6 types of guns to suit your playstyle, and as you use a gun its proficiency meter increases, letting you perform more dame with that type. Weapons might also have a elemental damage, with can also do damage over time, and some are a hard counter against enemies (eg shock vs shields, fire vs unarmored enemies and corrosion vs armored)
 
There are a lot of enemy types in the game, with each looking visually different and performing differently on the field. Not only to you have hostile humans (bandits and the crimson lance to kill), but loads of types of wildlife that attack from the air, ground and underground, and lots of them to keep you constantly shooting and killing. Each enemy has a weak point where if damaged you will score a critical hit and inflict extra damage. While the game does reuse all of its enemy types multiple times there are enough types of enemies that it doesn’t draw away from the game.
 
The visual style is likely what saved borderlands from being another standard open world shooter. Instead of aiming for high quality graphics (which don’t age very well), Borderlands uses a cel shaded style that adds a cartoony vibe with retaining all the gore and adult humor. Because of this, Borderlands is still playable today. The environment are also rendered in the same way, and are varied (though not as much as later entries into the series)
 
Borderlands also includes a very good marketing soundtrack, which is something the series continues. While there aren’t many musical songs in the game, the opening song sets the tone that is continued throughout the game.
 
There are 4 expansion DLCs that have been released, with 3 of them being highly recommended. The zombie island of Dr Ned, Armory of General Knoxx and Claptraps Robot Revolution all increases the level cap, add extra quests and weapons and are fun to play. Moxxis underdone riot should have been fun, but is a painstaking task in tediousness that you will either want to skip or do with friends to make the time pass quicker. Even then you aren’t rewarded in xp, or special drops.
 
If you are chasing 100% achievements then it’s possible, although a few of them are much easier to do with a co-op friend to help. Be prepared to spend a lot of hours as there are a ton of quests that need to be completed.

3256,"Awesome, even after almost 10 years. Has surprisingly good graphics."
3257,"2hrs in, the only problem is that theres not enough character costumization, instead of the usual 2 hrs of customizing, its just 20 minutes... Also, almost 2 hours of gameplay and 17 missions, but no assult rifle? What?"
3258,itS a Great game
3259,"this game reminds me of my mother
i love my mother"
3260,pretty damn fun but better when you play with friends. :)
3261,"Borderlands is one of those classics you can always come back to. The enemies are fun to kill, the protagonists are fun to play, and the story is funny and entertaining. Fun enough alone but even better with friends."
3262,oldie but goldie
3263,"Really enjoying co op mode!
Fast paced game, loads of fun!"
3264,It's a really good game.
3265,awesome game in general.  definitely deserved its game of the year awards.
3266,"Love the game, Borderlands has given me houndreds of hours of joy!
Huge recommend, a must get!"
3267,is good
3268,"I played this FPS game after a long time as the Siren who has the power to phase walk, which is the ability to run away if the situation gets difficult. The first few hours of the game felt a little drab (like in most RPGs). After the character got to level 5, the fun in the game increased multi-fold. The guns which have elemental damage that you get in the later part make the game lots of fun to play. There isn’t much in terms of story, but there are a couple of places where there are unintended consequences for your actions.

Overall, it is a game that can be played only once. I have the DLC as well, but I don’t see myself playing it any time soon."
3269,"honestly honestly honestly the best game ever????!??!?! 
just get this game already."
3270,"This game started a whole new genre in its own way.
RPG+FPS+COOP
Borderlands franchise is simply the best game around that allows you to play with friends and family together in 4-player COOP through the entire campaign and it's just so much fun to be had."
3271,"This game has not aged well.  Borderlands 2 has.  But this has not.
I still really like the game though, so I would still recommend it.  The humour and plot inspired many games since it, and it's still playable."
3272,"If you started off with Borderlands 2 and decided to play the first one purely cuz you havent played the first one yet then ill give you my personal touch on the game in the little time that I spent playing it.
Story started off kinda dull tbh, the quests are just kinda borring really and the navigation doesnt tell me much aswell, I get the whole idea behind it having that rpg feel with the compas thing but it really doesnt help me much out, I found myself mostly lost and searching for the objective aswell and even then it proved the gameplay to be kinda dull and borring.
Im kinda on the minority side of things with this game to some it may be the best but to  me personaly I just dont feel the same about it, I had pretty high expectations from a game that came out in 09 but oh well, it is what it is.
If you wish to get it durring sale id suppose it would be worth the price but in general buying it flat out like that, just dont there are better things you could get than this.
Also excuse my trash grammar, English isnt my first language."
3273,"This game is a lot of fun. Also I have played somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 hours on the PS3.

Pros for me:
1. Unique Art Style
2. Rpg leveling and loot systems
3. Semi-Unique level trees that encourage a few styles of gameplay.
4. Mostly interesting story
5. Goofy Humor (though it can get stale, one reason why I can't get into any of the new games)
6. Small punishment for death, but there is a punishment
7. Controls feel good, and so does shooting,

Cons for me:
1. Run here and follow this waypoint missions
2. Potential Grindiness if you are trying to get a certain type of weapon
3. Enemy variety not super huge, compared to how big the world is.
4. Being up to a certain level is too important, which means skill takes a backseat sometimes. If you are a few levels below an enemy the game artificially lowers your damage, you are already weaker there was no need from this (maybe included to prevent gaining 10 levels from a high level enemy by hitting it from safety???)

Not the biggest shooting game fan but this one is really solid and kept my attention through a few playthroughs with a few characters."
3274,"This game got me into Action RPG-FPS. Not the most polished, and characters are relatively one-dimensional, but still gr8."
3275,"I suprisingly love this game more than borderlands 2.

A person made this game have a special place in my heart and I just love the damn under dome DLC."
3276,"Hellyess
"
3277,"This is one of the best games I ever played. Borderlands is on par with the best (Fallout 3, 4, and New Vegas), except for one thing, which always irritates me and that is not being able to save whenever you want. Other than that, everything else about it is great. It has its quirky goofy characters and an excellent story line. There is a huge array of weapons with the ability to cause elemental damage. So, certain weapons work better against certain enemies. The sooner a player figures that out the easier it will be. The side missions are all challenging but fun. They do not get repetative. The DLC's are excellent, too. The biggest question for me is would I play it again. The answer is yes and I give it a 9.5/10!"
3278,good game
3279,The Best Game Ever Made. I only have about 90 hours on pc but between borderlands 1 and 2 on xbox 360 i had around 2000 hours.
3280,"Man this game is a personal milestone for me.

I remember the ammassing hours I put into the Xbox version with a friend in college. I remember loving the games. The fights. The world. THE LOOT.

Then he got a girlfriend and I got it on Steam. The first ""M"" game to purchase at college.

And I loved it. Love it. And my goodness is ""Jacob's Cove"" one of the greatest DLCs ever (actually, Shivering Isles is).

Yes, the graphics are no where near Borderlands 2. Yes, there are plenty of headshots that dont register. Yes, the story is sorta lacking. Yes, the characters are as invested into with said story.


BUT ALL THAT CHANGES WITH ITS SEQUEL. Seriously, play this game, if anything, to appreciate Borderlands 2 to its fullest.

If anything, JUST TO STINKIN LOOT. <333"
3281,"Well, played this game and removed from the library, found 2nd one better but if you like gunplay and chests then go for it, has better guns and loot then the 2nd iteration of the franchise, pretty old game in 2018 but still a great bang for the buck, love whole franchise."
3282,Balance is completely fucking broken and the pacing is next to non-existent. Just skip to 2.
3283,"As fun now, as 9 years ago really."
3284,"You need a reason? (Wow...) Sorry, my reasons only make sense in hindsight. Play the game first! Then i'll tell you the reason, if you still need one.

It's *that* good."
3285,"If you just beat BL2, and feel somehow like wanna flashback to try vanila one. Then welcome to old days modern vault hunter!

Pro:
   - Sprint that doesn't require to hold shift all the time!
   - When Manifactor still made a Usable/Great Assault rifle
   - That's a lot of regenarate ammo guns!
   - you can buy more ammo capacity with just money!
   - Weapon proficiency = specific gun type wet dream
   - Most of random drop gun/shield even with less than 5 lv from your curent level or more are usable untill end of the first playthrough 
   - Want ridiculous Stupid fast dakka with explosive round pistol that you will never got in bl2l? You got that! 

Con: 
   -  Unskipable cutsences with slow life begining of the story
   - No auto ammo/health pickup for you
   - Ain't fun bunny hop anymore
   - No mini map! just a good old day compass with crappy Echo diamond mark location
   - If you want more Inventory slot You need to fix random Clap trap around map
   - Even more Clap trap(s) than you can handle. From both bl2 and pre sequal combind

I give this

3286,The Game
3287,"This first Borderlands is pretty rough in writing and design; it feels like somewhat of a slog to play through, and the game doesn't quite have the voice the series is known for in its later installments.  I'd probably recommend just skipping ahead to a later Borderlands game, if you need some numbers-heavy gunplay."
3288,My all time favorite game
3289,Nobody's up for mp these days :(
3290,Excellent game
3291,"Its Borderlands, nuff said!"
3292,"I ain't doing this review comparing Borderlands 1 with Borderlands 2, 'cause the first game will sound inferior, wich is not true, It's just very diferent
This review was updated for the remastered version of BL1, check it [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/4lw4ysch4ng1ngn4m3s/recommended/729040] Here [/url]


[h1] Story [/h1]

Borderlands 1's Story is... Weak, with boring and irrelevant characters(in the Base game) that end up just giving random and irrelevant secondary quests, and some main quests. During the whole story it's promissed a vault filled with loot, but in reality it's pretty disappointing and there's nothing of it, besides the doesn't even respawn, which is a problem, at least for me.


[h1] Ambience [/h1]

Borderlands 1's maps are(most or them) desert themed, I do like their designs(Bandit camps mostly), but your opinion might be diferent. Most of the desert maps are quite big, and you're able to (in most cases) use vehicles(in base game, there's only one, in Knoxx's DLC there are 3). The maps that are not Desert usualy are Underground forts or a Town/Camp, these tend to be smaller and, no vehicles.


[h1] Singleplayer or Co-Op? [/h1]

Well... Playing alone can be boring, Because you really feel alone, with little dialog from NPCs(honestly, there's very few), but all loot is yours... Hehehe
In Co-Op you should have more fun, the game was meant to be played co-op.


[h1] Weapons [/h1]

There's a looot of weapons to chose from, most of them do look the same, even though are diferent, the game's from 2009 and it's impressive the ammount of available weapons. What makes the weapons diferent, are their weapon parts, this makes certain weapons (legendaries, uniques, etc.), even if underleveled, better than new loot you find

To acquire legendaries or Pearllescents(DLC) you'll need luck, a random world drop(random enemy, loot chests, vending machines) rather than a specific boss.


[h1] Classes [/h1]

If you're playing Co-Op, it's recomended that each party member plays a diferent character(class), each class is unique on their own, all have skill trees , that boost their respective action skill and weapons in many ways. There are Class Mods, that boost skills and add a special effect to the team or just yourself, such as Health Regen., bigger mag size, you get it.


[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

My biggest complaint with the game, it's the lack of farmable bosses, I know that I wouldn't compare BL1 with BL2, but in this case was needed

The customization is very limited, you can only change colors.

I have over 75 hours of game, my first character was Lilith(now lvl 69), and I felt like doing this, here is my score:

7,5/10"
3293,"This is the game that got me into the RPG genre. It's unique shell shaded art style, crude since of humor, and solid gunplay really made this game great. The world was empty and baron with hardly any dialouge to break the silence which some may say is a downfall of this game, but personally I believe that made it even better. It truly conveyed that you are alone on an alien planet and the whole world is out to kill you. Most games today aim for a casual audience and this can be seen with the later games in this series which isnt bad but I personally prefer a more raw and hardcore expereince. The 4 DLC's in this game, and yes thats 4 not the insane amount that Borderlands 2 had. They didn't rush to make deadlines or flood the market with content. The DLC in this game feel almost like complete games on their own and they are each unique in their own way. My only complaint about the entire game is that if your going for 100% completion Mad Moxxi's Underdome will take what feels like forever to finish. I hav sat through this for the ps3 but after rebuying this game for steam I jsut couldn't bring myself to put that kind of time in again. I did mention that this game is an RPG but similar to that of Skyrim or Fallout 4, Borderlands is more focused on gunplay and loot as oppposed to RPG elements such as skill and class buildiing. I guess one could argue it is more of a ""casual RPG"" if that is even a term to describe games. Personally I wished the RPG elements were more fleshed out but even in later games they have kept this same system(minus weapon proficiencies). Overall this game is a must buy whether your playing as a solo or teaming up with other vault hunters. 

Final Score: 9/10"
3294,"Played Borderlands 2 before this one and although i much prefered 2 to 1, this was a very enjoyable game! Haven't started and of the DLC but the base game was fun, would recommend!"
3295,great game but graphics make me feel drowsy or some headache of somekind it doesnt matter how i change them i cant play this game for more than half an hour
3296,"One hell of a game.I had lots of fun going through it, especially with the DLC.It also helps you get some of the refrences from the 2nd game"
3297,2112
3298,The only things this game is missing are Midges in Fridges.
3299,Best game in the series tbh in my opinion
3300,"Before steam I had this game. Then I bought the game and the dlc together. Then I bought it on steam as a complete pack. I find I don't really like this game anymore. The dialogue is clever and fun most of the time. I would consider this game the beta to Borderlands 2.

3301,"This is a very crude rpg shooter. It's almost a miracle that Borderlands 2 is a masterpiece. This one have many problems, clonky movements, terrible hud, not friendly or eficient mechanics at all (you have to manually pick up money/health/ammo on the ground and confirm every time you want to buy anything, ammo included), terrible aim system and a very boring story filled with boring characters, quests and upgrades.
Turning this game into that amazing sequel is a miracle indeed. I absolutelly do not recommend this one. Just jump into Borderlands 2, you are not missing much."
3302,lol
3303,"Amazing game with fun gameplay, memorable characters, and a sense of humor. The soundtrack and atmosphere are beautiful and make me nostalgic whenever I return. I personally think it's better than the sequel even if it has more flaws, and the experience I had playing this is unforgettable."
3304,Owo veryy fun message me how to get it without paying
3305,Besto Game-u Ever UwU
3306,Required text
3307,"as a modern game, the first borderlands game on steam is bad, there was no directory for visuals, sensitivity settings areout of whack and much more that I can't be bothered to talk about."
3308,"What can i say about this game that hasn't already been said. The start of a great video game franchise. As is often the case I played this franchise in the wrong order - starting with the wonderful Borderlands 2 completing that and its many DLC in co-op mode.

I realised I had never played the original game, so I set out (21 hours ago) to fix this. Completing the main story on my lonesome the game was certainly enjoyable however I agree with other reviewers here who say they feel this game is missing some of the special charm of later installments. There are long periods of running around with not a lot to do, and some of the quests are a little bit boring and repetitive.

The game performs well, considering it will be celebrating its 10th birthday next year, however there are typical physics and general gameplay glitches that are found in many games of its era. I have fallen off things, almost gotten stuck in some areas, had to quit due to game-breaking glitches with elevators, invisible walls everywhere etc etc. The other thing that is a bit of a downer is that you have to manually set the FOV using a shortcut key everytime you exit a vehicle, also the game doesn't like to be tabbed out of.

All in all, a good game - definitely if you've played other games in the series. Try and pick the game up in a bundle or on sale as it is good to get all the DLC if possible."
3309,"I'd say it's harder then 2 and 1.5, because you can't do crap without hitting headshots, so this should give a fair challenge.
You can get the game with dlcs for ~$4 from 3rd party sites btw."
3310,Grade A franchise
3311,ok
3312,"the borderlands games are the best games i have ever played have 1000s of hours on borderlands 2 and i just brought a new laptop to play borderlands 1. they do everything right the story, gameplay and personality they give the charecters in both games are spot on. would defenitly reccomend"
3313,"Borderlands is one of my favourite series. Really different approach to the shooter, RPG genres with an interesting art style. The cell shaded style works well and it would seem weird to see it in another type. Its more or less fixated and become the brand of the game. 

The open world aspect of this game is quite good. The maps are fairly large and expand through fast travel points into different areas. The graphics are decent. Being an older game and me only playing it within the last few years, they aren't that bad. The gameplay and dialogue is amazing. Well written and funny made it a lot more interesting and kept me engaged. The gunplay is unique to anything I've played. The different types of guns you get with the large variety of types and looks sometimes made me swap out every once and a while. Only downsides for me are some of the repetitive quests and the slight grindy-ness somtimes.  The DLC's are worth the buy as well. Adding a lot more extra content and cool stories. 

Overall I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of shoot em' up RPG's then this is a must buy. 

8/10"
3314,If you played other borderlands games you'll probably wont like it but still its the first game. If you are just trying to get into borderlands this game is not a good choice. Oh btw there is a super annoying robot trash talks non stop.  Overall its a good game you can buy it on sales just to play it for story.
3315,"Nois
"
3316,Not as good as Borderlands 2.  Better than the Pre-sequel.  This is the title that started my addiction.
3317,Awesome Game :D
3318,"Yes.....just yes!!

..To me Borderlands is one of the most iconic games made in the last 20 years.I've played through with my family on several occasions and its always fun.So great replay value.It also has a lot of likeable and very funny characters that will stick in your memory.

..It plays a lot like a 1st person shooter version of Diablo.Which means it has heavy rpg elements, randomized loot drops in varying qualities.(green is ok ,blue is better purple is great orange is super.)Put in random stats on all those plus  each character has a different playstyle and several different builds that unlock as you level up.And you've got the basics down.
The game world has a storyline to play through but there are tons of side quest and it is an open world so you can go as fast or slow as you like.

..Graphics are dated but because they are so unique you don't notice as much.The game also has a great soundtrack which keeps you pumped during play.It should run on any pc made in the last decade.

Would I recommend this game?.......YESSS! As long as you understand it is an older game so there isn't a lot of eye candy.
Though the story and gameplay are very solid."
3319,Two words: bird button.
3320,"A pure loot-shoot-based game. Not very deep, nor realistic, but has very satisfying action and gives plenty of toys to play with.
The game is stable and doesn't seems to have any bugs. If there are any, I haven't encountered them.
It's also cheap compared to similar games.
It's good."
3321,"Really good, a bit dated now and no.2 is definately better but this is still a great game and definately better than the presequeal. Also the DLC for this is great so get it GotY."
3322,Just buy it
3323,"This game is REALLY good for low end laptops. The replayibilty of it is insane, not as much as 2, but still very easy and fun game for its hardware requirments."
3324,"still my favorite of the 3 games. there are just these little detales that make the game seem like it had alot more thought put into it then the 2nt ot 3rd game. Like the bandets will taunt you wile walking by and not just mindlessly attack you, or eleamentle damage actualy has realy cool effects. You can see the corrosion dripping off of enemies, and when someone is shocked it frys the flesh off of bandets heads. Some will say its meaningless detale but i think it makes the game that much better."
3325,"Great game you can play forever!
"
3326,Still a great game today. Timeless art style and graphics
3327,good game
3328,Great game
3329,"Come on, catch a riiiide!

In all seriousnes though, this game is awesome.  The art style, story and comedy really draw you in and immerse you.  Every time I've played it I loose track of time.  This game is even better if you can enjoy with friends."
3330,YES - OUI - SI - SIM - DA - Да - JA - हाँ - 是 - 对
3331,This is just as how I remember it i created so much characters and love the dlc (mad moxi's Underdome Riot is hard and gets boring trying to grind it) but other than that the dlc the story the countless side quests the playthroughs you can do and maybe i'm giving this a thumbs up from nastalga but I don't believe that because I remember how it was and how it is theres been some differences since I played it on my xbox 360 (mainly dlc) but either way they turned out good.
3332,Very goooood. Brings back memories. 11.5/10
3333,it just works
3334,the original OG
3335,"I was a bit disappointed by this game. After some time it felt repetitive, tedious, even boring. The checkpoint system, when after starting the game you have to travel to certain location from the central hubs, was horrible. And the humour just didn't work for me."
3336,Greg ate my dog. amen
3337,"This was one of the first games I ever purchased for myself instead of receiving as a gift after first playing it on my xbox 360. Even now I still enjoy just obliterating everything that moves on Pandora.

Good fun."
3338,Gun Porn Volume 1
3339,"If you still didn't, buy this."
3340,Its on older gamr but its definitely one of the best out there
3341,"Great game, better with friends."
3342,"Probably one of the best games I've ever played in my life, I love it so much. Don't get me wrong, the second and third are amazing as well but this one takes the cake, it's endless fun especially with DLC, I've played it over and over around 4-5 times"
3343,Greatest
3344,An absurd amount of content wrapped in a very enjoyable loot-fest. Light RPG mechanics in a way that allows for a lot of casual fun and ridiculousness without much inventory management or pausing in general. One of my favorite co-op games.
3345,Best game I ever played!
3346,"I love this game so much, i just wished I could have transferred my characters from Console :,("
3347,"The one that started it all, super fun campaign but it's been far improved with the followup BL2. Absolutely worth a playthrough, or 3, still."
3348,"One of the best co-op games with plot. The variety of equipment and weapon is amazing! If you are bored from typical games as dota or cs to play with friends, definetely recommend to try this out."
3349,ыыы
3350,This game is quite old but it's an incredibly fun and satisfying game/series to play with 4 of your friends. It literally takes over your life! Highly Recommended!
3351,"great co-op experience, DLC will have you playing for hours."
3352,"Don't let the age of the game fool. This game is amazing and a ton of fun to play alone but is still better with friends. If I had to describe any series of games that are a must have to get on steam Borderlands would definitely be top 5. To keep the review simple 4 classes all which get benefits to different weapons but you can use any gun you want anyway and still be effective. I would say to spring for the GOTY edition as the DLC are a lot of fun and add some nice post game content (except for underdome which is the only sin this game has ever commited but still 3/4 isn't bad). Don't even look at the normal edition just wait for a sale to happen and the GOTY goes to $7.50. Overall the game is a lot of fun and I highly recommend getting it but only on sale since 30 is a bit steep to be fair and it is on sale on pretty much every single sale steam has.

Just to elaborate on underdome: It adds 3 arena modes which are basically grind fests. You kill wave after wave of enemies for rewards that are not worth it. There are 5 rounds and each round has 5 waves of enemies. It may not sound like a lot but it is extremely tedious and each of these areas takes about an hour to beat. That is all the dlc has to offer. It is just an arena grind that becomes less fun by the time you 1/4th of the way through it. Enemy health damage and sheilds scale every round making the waves slower later on.  Also there is no way to stop and continue between rounds and if you die you start again from the beginning. 

Now you might be thinking ""oh that is it? 3 hours worth of content that isn't so grindy"" well think again because while you may have experiences all of the ""lesser challenges"" for the arenas and experienced what its like to be on them you still have the ""larger challenges"". These challenges up the amount of rounds to a whopping 20. That is right 20. 100 waves of enemies PER COLISSEUM. These colisseums come complete with rules that will do things such as buff certain weapons (like rocket launchers or shotguns) while nerfing the damage of all other weapons rather significantly, let enemies regenerate shield faster, make players less accurate but increase damage and just straight up make enemies more accurate. So it will pretty much buff enemies while possibly messing with your weapon set especially if you do not have suitable shotguns or rocket launchers to use for the rules. Also remember that scaling health damage and shields? Well on round 19 they get about 32% bonus health 48% damage increase and 64% shield increase making enemies a lot more difficult to deal with. I hope you weren't too upset about the 1 hour per arena time I mentioned before because now you get to spend around 4 hours (probably more) per arena just grinding out the same enemies for minimal reward. Those small dialogues between waves and rounds become a lot more tedious when you want nothing more than the next round to start so you can move on with your life. Of course none of this is mandatory and you can ignore this dlc completely in favor of the much more fun other dlcs but man this one is frustrating if you want 100% achievements. You will not find anyone posting playthroughs of the larger arena challenges (which are the ones that are required for the 3 achievements.) but you will find them playing the smaller ones or you will find videos of glitches/ways to get through these challenges more easily. Such as getting a level 16 host of the game and then have your max level friends join so all of the enemies are level 16 (They scale to the host level unlike other DLC which have a base level and actual story). This dlc was a bad choice to put in the game but it does not cancel out all the good the other dlc is for the game. I would ignore underdome completely unless you want 100%."
3353,"Lots of loot, gg"
3354,my name jef
3355,"I have about 300 hours in this game on PS3, what else is there to say besides I have the Platnium and it shaped my childhood"
3356,"Honestly an incredible game, purchased on multiple platforms and thousands of hours across the entire series. This game is great for newcomers and even better due to the sale. If you are looking for a good game to pick up to spend time on, look no further."
3357,"The aiming is horrible, but the game is still somewhat fun."
3358,very good
3359,played it on xbox 10/10
3360,"This is an amazing game but I'd say bl2 or the handsome collection will be more entertaining for longer. If you have already played the other games, and want more of the story, this is definitely worth a buy"
3361,"I have bought this game so many times for each platform of gaming, from xbox's to PC's. Really really good shooter, funny , great story line. One of my favourites"
3362,"Worth when on sale. If you haven't played any borderlands game yet, play Borderlands 2, then come back to this. It's a bit old and the story feels rushed towards the end but it's better if you already invested into the franchise and its lore."
3363,Really fun game
3364,One of the best games ive ever played
3365,Smart visuals are relevant even today. Good game playing solo as well as playing with friends.
3366,You can really enjoy it with friends!
3367,worth to buy anytime!
3368,"JUST...

AMAZING!!!"
3369,"On the whole a good game.
Game play: First person shooter, lots of fun when played with friends allowing the benefits of the different characters to be used during the same run. The game runs on an level system and suggests the level for each task/mission and warning if an enemy is too powerful allowing you to choose if you want to commit suicide or not.
Main story can feel quite linear but the addition of side missions allows a more open feel to it.
Graphics: looks good not too gory.
Sound: Music not intrusive to game play.
In conclusion great game for killing things with your friends, needs improvement with trading with friends but has been fixed with other Borderlands games.
"
3370,you want guns? how bout a shit ton? play this game with friends and thank me later
3371,Love this game!!!
3372,Old but good
3373,"One of the few games I've played that balances itself for both single player gameplay, or when you want to go all out with a group of friends.  The gameplay and continuous feed of RNG loot is addictively fun!  I've put well over the 161 hours Steam says I've played of this game but regardless, if you like looter shooters with an admirably funny storyline, this game is one you can be sure will get you going."
3374,"Pretty solid game. At first I thought that it wasn't to good looking... then I found out that my settings were set to lowest possible. After turning them up I was like... YO this looks sick!! Other than that the gameplay matches the visuals... and by that I mean there is a lot of  stat comparison. Like serriously, I spent half this game just just trying to pick out wheather I wanted + %2 ammo with my gun or + %2 criticle hit damage. If your sentimental like I am however you'll want to at least buy the Underdom dlc so you can keep all the cool unique weapons you get. The story is good, but for the build up it gives about the vault... the game is a bit lack luster. I found to small side quest more interesting after I saw the end. I do recomend it however even for it's flaws I had a great time."
3375,"The Gameplay:
It's ok. It has multiplayer. It started off the Borderlands series but honestly it felt slow.

The Story:
Couldn't tell you, but a slow enough start + gameplay that I was bored to tears.

Visuals:
Dated, it doesn't look good and the 2nd game isn't much of a looker either. The cartoon look they would later lean into would be the move. Standard visual graphics was not the play here.

The Sounds:
Wasn't pronounced enough to register, I don't even remember.


The Experience:
This is a somewhat unfair review going by my usual standard but I simply could not play the game. It also doesn't help that I played the second game first. So the entire time I kept thinking this is not as good as the second game. I have been able to get over this hurdle in the past, however in this case it couldn't hold my attention enough."
3376,its a good game. would recommend.
3377,Guns
3378,a good go to fun shoot em up with goals
3379,Old game but still stands the test of time!
3380,10/10
3381,"An all time favourite. Easy to play solo, even better with friends. Wacky design, hilarious jokes, and (to a lesser effect) a CL4P unit.

Would recommend to anyone and everyone"
3382,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi6itlbaLWs

Didnt work until you did what this video describes. 
With the better re-release becomes this old version obsolete."
3383,This game is great. i played it when it first came out maxed out a chericter and still come back every year or two. just fantastic.
3384,BY far the best multiplayer game to play with your friends.
3385,"Even after all these years, this game is still amazing"
3386,"Fact of the matter is, Borderlands defined a new genre of questing gungame that had never been seen before. The memories I have playing this game when I was younger and actually getting along with my older brother while playing it really speaks volumes to the nature of the co-op aspect.

The cherry on top is the fact that the developers took the time to come back and update such an old game to fix muiltiplayer when GameSpy shut down and broke it."
3387,One of the better FPS's out there
3388,"Had an absolute blast playing through the base game and DLCs co-op with a friend, hope to go back and get the last couple achievements for 100% soon! Great fun and highly reccomended, definately worth picking up a copy or two to enjoy with someone since it's usually out for a decent price :)"
3389,"One of most played games (8+ completed) across different platforms (PC, Xbox, PS).

Great gameplay, great characters and story and extremely fun to play with others."
3390,"I would rather play BL2, but this is still a good coop-fps!"
3391,"Borderlands is a great game, a fun shoot-em-up style with cool funky graphics and a good comedy ring to it, it is definitely more fun to play with your friends, trade weapons and help each other out with the many quests."
3392,great game
3393,"Pure chaos, pure fun. Alone or with fellow vault hunters, I recommend the game for it's humor, replayability, variety of gameplay and overall genre and quality. A classic that redefined it`s genre."
3394,very nice
3395,Its a game I keep coming back to. Still fun with friends.
3396,"like destiny, but it's actually good and costs less"
3397,"A bit dated but well worth going through the entire series with a few friends.

The ""Take Over Your Life Bundle"" is ridiculous value as well."
3398,Unique blend of RPG and FPS. Still holds up and always a blast with multiplayer! Super fun and hilariously funny at the same time.
3399,Great gmae to enjoy with friends!
3400,I do indeed enjoy this game. I believe that it is very enjoyable. I would in fact recommend it. Thank you for the time it took for you to read this review. Good night.
3401,Excellent game
3402,"Dog Blog, fun gam"
3403,A really fun game. I really like that there is so many bad gun that when you get a good gun you get excited to shoot some enemies with it.
3404,"Years after the release, this game continues to be one of the best. I've played and the humor doestn get old each playthrough, the entire series is something you can be happy to play again and again"
3405,this game is very good and funny
3406,"Run around and shoot em up. Crazy villains, crazy allies, for what little of a storyline this game has, it's pretty damn good."
3407,"Wonderful game, lots of fun...even better when played with friends!"
3408,♥♥♥
3409,"WARNING TO ANYONE WHO WISHES TO PLAY THIS

I highly recommend buying it even with the very, VERY small problems im going to list below. This is a classic of videogaming and has far more content than half the games out there today.

My only two problems are i dont remember it being so pixelated (tho they probably just didnt optimise for HD)
And why do i have aim assist with my Mouse and Keyboard with no way to turn it off

Seriously, its 9 dollars right now, and its one of the best games youll ever play. Buy it."
3410,I used to play this game on the 360 and it's every bit as good as I remember. Fantastic game and much better with other people. The portability of having it on my laptop makes it that much better.
3411,"Disappointingly short, but good"
3412,"Even if it's 2018, this game is still awesome!!! No words only feelings"
3413,One of the best shoot and loot games out there. It is by far my favortie game franchise.
3414,One of the best Coop Games ever in my opinion!
3415,"Great game! Needed to edit game to get 90 FOV because of that the game is so old and not so updated.
You dont have to play this game first in oder to play borderlands 2 but it sure helps if you like lore in games. The story in both games are amazing"
3416,Good ass game. doing this for steam achievement
3417,After all those years it is still a fantastic game. Only downside is the missing FOV slider.
3418,BIG OOF REVIEW
3419,Even after all these years after this games release this game still is fun to come back to. Especially after all of the custom content for this game.
3420,Great game for solo or playing with friends
3421,"Its a good game if you get past the bugs...



All ten thousand of them

Otherwise good coop game"
3422,"it the best game to be played with 4 players .... 
the loot system is unique 
and 
For Single Player , is Unbeatable ..."
3423,history
3424,Beautiful game!
3425,Ya shoot a buch of stuff with a bunch of guns.  It's good.
3426,"A superb game that ive played since release, although i have only recently acquired the game on Steam if i could transfer my countless hours and progress from my xbox 360 here i would. lots of friends and memories made through this game, very good ones too"
3427,Lots of fun lots of banter driving friends over trolling revives. Stealing loot.
3428,"Great story and a lot of fun to complete the campaign with friends!
One of the best Co-op games I've played!
Though this game is released long back, the graphics doesn't feel outdated at all! Thanks to its cartoony style! ;)
I highly recommend this game!"
3429,its borderlands
3430,diz gud
3431,"I want a Playthough 3 which can reset the story whenever you want as BL2 and TPS. seriously , you get maximum lv and gear when you are most end of game and DLC , a PT 3 can reset infinitely is so good. Everything else of game: 9/10"
3432,"It's good, especially with friends"
3433,Get it.
3434,Instant classic to play with your dudes.
3435,Cool!
3436,Still the most fun you can have blowing the heads off of screaming midgets swinging axes at you without getting in legal trouble
3437,Best aim and shoot and charismatic game ever!
3438,"Much better than the 2nd game in terms of premise, characters, tone, and atmosphere. In this version of the Borderlands universe you are a ruthless mercenary looking for loot and and a big payday at the end, the world is brutal, lonely, screwed up in everyway, including the people living in it. The music is a darker and more mysterious tone much like the original 2 fallout games, the voice acting and dialogue is usually more serious than the rest of the series but when it uses humor it tends to be a much more black humor style rather than the spastic meme nature of the 2nd game. Sadly they throw away much of this in the sequel. 

The gameplay is that of a fps with 4 different classes, that have their own skill trees and special abilities, all of them rather good except the siren. The weapons and shooting feel mostly good and is satisfying. Coop is highly recommend for best experience but can be done in single player. The game has good length and the add ons are worth the extra price. Also the loot is always interesting, despite being a shooter this game is following in the footsteps of diablo style arpgs. 

Highly recommend!"
3439,"Good game,excellent graphics.Nice game play,really fun to play."
3440,"A good experience in a western land, but on a different planet. A long game, a good game to play with firends and very funny characters. A good game to relax and to explore something new."
3441,Good.
3442,HEY HOOO STEVOOO
3443,You shoot things and then they explode
3444,Wonderful co-op game.
3445,k
3446,BIg gay
3447,one of the best first person shooters I have ever played
3448,this is a really fun game to play with friends.
3449,"this is probably my fave game ever like this right here is what i look for in a looter shooter
"
3450,"Really had a blast playing with friends, but... too bad it is outdated to these days operating systems and hardware, certainly needs a remastered version. 
And yes, I've tried everything possible and even outside the box to try to make it work but sadly... doesn't work anymore on Windows 10.

Comparing against Borderlands 2.

For me... it was better.

Because in here you are a nobody, you aren't a glamourized hero from the very beginning that everyone wants to praise and meme around you, you have to impress people instead, and still get them thinking less of you until the very end.

Never was a fan of games that i get praised and rewarded so earlier on lore. Fans of Valkyria Chronicles who remembers the PSP version and Avan will sure know what i mean, if not... Fallout comes to mind, the older ones that you had to make people respect you.

"
3451,"I Love This game I play away after work it's not harder or easy but it's make me feel good 
"
3452,The best game :)
3453,I love this game
3454,"Borderlands is old (kinda), but I still get a lot of playtime out of it. It's a first person shooter, open-world type, and really fun!"
3455,very  fun game  to play with friends.
3456,Start of a great series. Great mix of humor and shooter
3457,11/10. Mindblowing good! Became one of my favorites ever.
3458," I Highly Enjoyed This Game, Even With A Low Spec PC. I Care About Graphics, And Even On The Lowest Settings Possible, It Still Gave The Cartoon/Telltale Games Art Style, Love The Combat, Storytelling, And The Whole Explore And Looting Mechanism. If You Have The 7.49$ I Reccomend Buying It."
3459,"As someone who was never fond of shooters or co-op games, I consider borderlands series (not you, pre-sequel) a gaming marvel. Don't look at my hrs on record - I've played this game for 250+hrs before I could buy it officially (sadly).

Artsyle that stands out, amazing characters and story, fun, sometimes hard, always comfortly paced and amazing gameplay, infinite variety of weaponry and sick, dashing humour. Borderlands isn;t something you can describe with words clear enough, you just gotta try it. It's amazing and get only better with DLCs.

Though better bplayed with friends (at least grab a buddy), this game provides infinite replayability. I still love it, though I lack time to play and all of my co-op partners have abandoned it for something new.

CATCH A RIIIIDE!"
3460,"The original Borderlands is, quite simply put, a fantastic experience that anyone who has a love for games similar to Diablo and FPS games should definitely try. It's vast nature and the way the story pulls all the environments together, giving you a real sense of a living world is really immersive. Unlike its later sequels, this game has a more gritty feel and really helps make this feel more realistic than the other games in the series.

The way I'd recommend playing it is with a friend or two, there's nothing quite like running around questing and finding just the right weapon/item with your mates.

Something keeps drawing me back to this game. Even though I think I've explored every inch of Pandora - there's always a something new to discover - whether it's a different weapon or item, a hidden loot area or just experiencing the game from a different character or team's perspective.

Get on the bus and try it, you won't regret it!"
3461,One of the best loot shooters and one that started it all.
3462,Very good game!
3463,Loved the feel of the Jacob Guns in B1
3464,"Great game.
"
3465,yeboi
3466,this is a great classic that you should play with friends. Highly recommend
3467,Absolutely amazing gameplay. I love it.
3468,The most fun I have ever had in a coop game.
3469,Best story. Best world. Best environment. Best weapons. Best DLC's. Best Game!!!
3470,Old but gold <3
3471,"I normally don't like FPSes, but the cartoony style and the wicked humour of this game are hard to resist."
3472,Loot'n and Shoot'n
3473,good game
3474,"Seriously great game. Thoroughly enjoyed playing it, gonna play it again sometime."
3475,fun af
3476,Loot&Shoot/10
3477,Great game best with friends
3478,"If you're really going this far to see if the game's good, this game is well worth your money (especially if you got it during one of Steam's many sales). The plot of the game isn't as captivating as its sequel, but it is by no means bad. The loot system is very enjoyable and the combat is captivating. Originally playing this years ago with my siblings first truly ignited my love for the franchise, and it has not dwindled since. As much as everybody praises Borderlands 2, there will always be a sense of nostalgia felt whenever I play this game. So yeah, get the game. And try to get the DLC as well, they are very worth it."
3479,"Great action mixed with a ton of humor.  Starting to show its age in some of the mechanics, but worth picking up if the price is right."
3480,"Borderlands is a great FPS RPG. It can be slow at time but when it gets going its great. 

Servers are usually dead tho :("
3481,i love thius game veryyyyy much
3482,play it
3483,"Just finished a 3 month (give or take) marathon of finally playing and beating Borderlands 1, 2, PS, and Tales! Beaten with Roland (1), Gaige (2), Athena (PS), and Athena, Springs and Zer0 (1st playthrough of Tales). Loved all the games and recommend them each highly."
3484,Really miss the days game devs would make a game with a lot of content such as this.
3485,"If you've played other borderlands games, this game is a pretty interesting experience, not because it's better, but because it's more experimental"
3486,fun game
3487,This is a game.
3488,Still love this game after all these years
3489,"Весёлая игра, забавные ачивки."
3490,:)
3491,I'm usually not a fan of futuristic games but Borderlands has something unique that I appreciate. Maybe it's because of the RPG element it brings in a unique way.
3492,Still awesome after all these years. <3
3493,ggo
3494,pretty good
3495,Still fun after all these years!
3496,Super fun game!
3497,Amazing. So many explosions. So fun. So many bandits! SO AWESOME!
3498,Crazy ride.
3499,"very short review

Pros: Decent combat, fun jokes, runs well enough, fun with friends, fun to grind for loot.
cons: Main story is a bit poo, the look off the game might be off-putting for some people.
Neutrals: fun DLC's"
3500,"Came for the guns, still there for the guns"
3501,"Burn, melt or electrecute your enemies. Or just run them over with car. 
Take your friend into this madness and exterminate your enemies, and in free time remember to take care of pumpkins…"
3502,game is too ez
3503,good game that holds up 9 years later
3504,Amazing game. Reminds me of the Firefly universe. Jesper Kyds soundtrack is awesome.
3505,Good coop game
3506,One of my favorite games ever. I fell in love with the style and the world and have replayed several times on many platforms.
3507,fun to play with friends
3508,"Sooooo what do i say about Borderlands.............well

"
3509,"very solid [8/10]
sure, borderlands 2 has waaaaay bigger and various world
but this is a very solid technical and visual foundation"
3510,"Uninstalled it.
Not recommended right now because game is poorly optimised to run for any device. Maybe the reason is windows 10 as many suggest on forum that it still works perfectly on windows 7. Laptop specs is above recommended specs so it should not run at 15 fps but unfortunately after trying every trick available on steam forum the game cannot run properly.
My advice would be to wait for remaster or try to play on  pre-steam copy.
Good Night !"
3511,Wasn't a big fan of this game because the story was just not that apealing.
3512,fun game with awesome graphics and storylines
3513,"Everytime I play this game, it is a new adventure. Random loot with ridiculous enemies make for a fantastic game."
3514,"My personal favorite game of the Borderlands series. Admittedly, it is missing quite a few QOL improvements that the sequels added in. It may just be nostalgia talking but something about this game resonates with me. I like the old looting system, the story, characters, general feel and look of the game. If you want to try out the Borderlands series, I definitely recommend this game but beware that it does have some tendacies that friends of mine dislike."
3515,Yes.
3516,"I always end up getting bored of this game after a while, and the story certainly is thin enough to be difficult to get into. But the gameplay is fun and it's definitely worth spending a few hours playing around in. Probably best played with a group of friends."
3517,i luv it. i also recommend it for all people like me. it has the perfect amount of gore and humor alot of my friends like it too youll love it if youre awsome
3518,It’s a great game if your bored or if you no game to play
3519,"It is 2018 and the game is still fun.

The standard price of 30 bucks is a bit too high in my opinion now, but for $10  or less its good."
3520,"Moving aside from the godawful retexture of Angel, This is an amazing game. While Borderlands 2 is objectively a better game, Borderlands 1 has a few key things better than any other game. One of the biggest being the Atmosphere in this game. The atmosphere of being in a hostile world, devoid of civilized life, stranded on your lonesome with only the skags to keep you company. It's incredible.


[spoiler] Another key thing done well is not having the complex bullshit that comes in TPS so thankfully we don't have to worry about anyone being rewritten into being a sappy sob backstory of ""misguided hero"" dumbfuckery[/spoiler]"
3521,"Very good game but sadly I got spoiled by watching the sequel, Borderlands 2 opening scene in between my playthroughs. Saved me countless hours on this one. 10/10 would love to get spoiled again!"
3522,"so f***ing long and tedious
can’t it just end already？
"
3523,"I am glad that the franchise has been improving over the years. 
For me Pre-sequel (for playing gravity) > Borderland 2 >>>>> Borderland 1
This game is quite boring."
3524,"I will always love the first Borderlands, it's a classic. It's even better if you have friends to play it with."
3525,"i played borderlands on ps3 and loved it, on pc though is another story.
my laptop had some issues running the game since it is full of details, textures, entitys and drops.
besides the lag and choppiness i still like the game and can't wait to start the dlc sometime soon.

Edit after playing more:
The game is still as fun as i remember and the dlc added so much entertaining content with jokes, decent story and more ways to get loot.
The general knoxx dlc was tedious with the driving though."
3526,nice game! really! makes alot of fun!
3527,(please exscuese my typos and bad spelling) The best vedio game serirs of all time I love all the borderlands games from its crude but funny humor to its addictive gameplay and this is were it all starts BORDERLANDS with thousands of hours of gameplay its hard to get bored and if you somehow do theres 3 more games to play so if your looking for a good game to play go look somewhere else because this a great game and one that suits every ones game style with its RPG elements to its amazing FPS system and its fun together multiplayer this game in short has it all and does it all with a lot of charm and thats why a rate this game a 9/10.
3528,"Up there with Fallout: New Vegas and Far Cry 3, this is the best single-player, open-world, old-school style, looter-shooter out there. Made way back in 2009, in a unique comic-style of hand-drawn textures, you bound around a hostile environment in Mad Max fashion gunning down an insane cast of characters and creatures while looting a mind-boggling array of weapons and gadgets. It has quite a simple uncomplicated design and the game is very approachable meaning it's quick and easy to pick up and play. 

Initially it has a great open-world feel but when you get beyond New Haven (about half way through) it branches out a lot and you gradually realise that it's more a case of ""areas separated by loadscreens"" rather than a ""genuine open-world"" affair.   

One slight criticism I do have is that I would liked to have seen a whole map of the entire world with all areas named and included (so that I could get my bearings) rather than single areas with no labels denoting the name of the neighbouring area. This system narrowed the context, made the game a bit too fragmentary and broke up the immersion a little bit. Additionally, it made handing in quests longer because I wasn't really sure where I was and where I needed to go. Also with well over 40 hours played and still not finished, the game can seem a tad long.  Anyway, the gameplay experience is great and I would definitely recomend Borderlands overall.

3529,"Do you like looting, shooting and MMO style questing? Or do you just want a fun co-op FPS game to play with friends?  if so, you might enjoy Borderlands.

Borderlands is a game where you play as 1 of 4 available classes which have different abilities and skill sets, tasked to seek out parts of a vault key scattered throughout Pandora (which is the planet you are on) to open a vault that only opens once every 200 years. In your journey, you will meet different friendly characters that would provide quests as well as enemy bosses to fight.

Borderlands has a decent amount of enemies to fight ranging from the suicide bomber psycho bandits to the armored crimsom lance soldiers. Most of the enemies can be dismembered or decapitated by gunfire or character abilities, depending on where you hit. For some reason, the crimsom lance soldiers cannot be dismembered unlike the rest of the enemies. The main bosses are pretty interesting as they have unique tactics and weakspots from one another. They are also introduced in a short but epic way through cutscenes.

Looting and questing are also main features in this game as you might want to open most chest, safe or container you see as they drop money, ammo and weapons. If you get lucky, you might chance upon a legendary weapon or a weapon that is stronger than the one you currently have. Weapons are seperated based on tiers and rarity from white which is common and the weakest to orange which is legendary and usually the strongest. Quests are given from characters as well as notice boards  and they give exp, money and gear when completed. It would be the main source of exp for leveling and there are a TON of quests!

After you finish the game, you can continue with all your character progression in terms of skills and gears to restart the game on ""playthrough 2"" and the enemies will scale according to your level for increased difficulty.

Co-op is available through LAN or Online which allows you to play through the game with friends or strangers depending on your preference and it might be much more fun compared to playing alone.

This game is not without it's downsides though, apparently you are not able to fast travel until you reach level 20 and have reached a certain questline but that is basically the first half of the game! Instead you have to run or drive your car everywhere which is a waste of time. Also when you are in a boss zone where the boss is at the deepest part of the map, after defeating the boss there is no short cut exit out and you have to run yourself back to the entrance which is another unnecessary waste of time. 

Most of the quest are also repetitive and very similar to one another. To sum it up, most quest are ""go to this zone and kill or collect this enemy or item"". Which can get old and boring fast.

Overall despite some flaws, borderlands is still a fun game and could be potentially more fun if you are playing co-op with friends or strangers. The hand-drawn aesthetic of borderland is also very visually appealing and have aged very well despite the age of this game.  I would give Borderlands a 7/10."
3530,"For the most part I feel like Borderlands 2 is a clear upgrade in almost all things to Borderlands. But damn this game holds a special place in my heart. Since it's the first game I have many fond memories. It got me addicted and that's why I played the shit out of it and the sequel. The story was not much but it strangely worked since you were basically just some mercs running around the desert killing bandits. Although the desert aspect can get boring at times the atmosphere was still amazing and the soundtrack helped alot with that. The weapons were fun and therefore shooting was fun too. 

The skills might've been a bit lackluster compared to what we have now in Borderlands 2 and pre sequel but it was still entertaining to level up and using your action skill to perhaps punch people in the face or phase in and out of dimensions.

 Finding legendary or pearlescent weapons was always awesome and felt rewarding since they were VERY powerful depending on what character you are playing or what weapon you got. 

Although the characters only really talked here and there for example if used a skill or killed a badass I still felt that was enough and every character had their personality. Of course in Borderlands 2 everyone is way more talkative and that is good to a degree I still like the way they were in this game.

All in all I think this is a must buy if you like the idea of some Diablo style RPG elements mixed with FPS."
3531,"good game
very fun"
3532,"I only recently got into the Borderlands series, having watched my brother play it with his friends years ago (around the time it originally released). I wish I hadn't waited so long. I know this game really shines when you play with friends, but even playing alone, I'm having a hell of a time. The gameplay loop is very well done, only occasionally making you feel like you're wasting your time (fetch and return missions for example), but those are relatively painless and short-lasting. The combat is incredibly well done, as is the selection of weapons and skills you have at your disposal. I think it's worth noting that the art style in this game has helped it to withstand the test of time, still looking fresh by today's standards."
3533,"It's a good game to co op with your buddies. Although compared to other games in the franchise, Borderlands has many shortcomings & feels a lot slower; more so if you've played Borderlands 2 or Pre Sequel first. 

Play the game to know the characters & their stories & appreciate that it exists because we got true masterpiece like Borderlands 2, built upon the flaws of this one."
3534,Buy it. Play it. Love it.
3535,"Great game, one of the few shooters I enjoy."
3536,The next best thing after jesus.
3537,GREAT GAME VERY FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3538,"Borderlands feels like the lovechild of Fallout 3 and Bioshock, with a little Mad Max thrown in for good measure. The cartoonish art style keeps the game feeling much younger than it really is, and the gunplay is fun and fluid. I had issues in getting the game to recognise my headset, and there ought really have been a way to enable v-sync in game (rather than having to alter the .ini file), but both were simple enough fixes. The UI could also have been better; the map/fast-travel system isn't as well thought out as it should be in a game with so many different areas, and inventory management is somewhat lacking. Any small nuisances are easily overlooked, however, and the game is a lot of fun (particualrly for the price it can be picked up for in 2018)."
3539,Very fun game
3540,"Borderlands is a First Person Shooter with lots of loot.
You can improve your Character by leveling up.
The Gameplay is fun, the artstyle is awesome and it has a nice story.
Thanks to the weapon system, there are many crazy weapons.
It is an overall well crafted game."
3541,My love for this game will never end. Even with all the improvements of Borderlands 2 I still love playing the first game.
3542,"Possibly one of my favorite games of all time. I still remember back in the day when I played it I sat down with my brother and watched him play for a long time until I got into it on my own. I've beaten this game multiple times with every character that there is, and without a doubt beaten all of the dlc's, side quests, and main story line. This game is so much fun especially if you have a friend with you who wants to play."
3543,"To start off, I am a huge fan of the Borderlands series and played this game based on nostalgia. When I first started it was hard for me to continue because it was so bland with very little action and a bunch of side quests. Even though there is a main story it doesn’t feel like it because you are bombarded with countless side missions that suffocates and minimizes the overall gameplay. You can easily be lost with boredom with the main storyline because it is uninteresting, and with all the side mission (126 missions) the outcome will be unavoidable. 

The biggest negative that I saw in the game was the color scheme of the maps. It felt as though everything is either light brown, brown, or dark brown. This aspect combined with the boring missions can leave the player in a bland experience. I think the biggest difference I found while playing this game compared to the other Borderlands games was the lack of an engaging soundtrack. The soundtrack didn’t help tie the action together which resulted in a limited experience. 

On the other hand, the biggest positive that I see in this game is through the characters. I found enjoyment in the classes which are unique and absolutely fun to play. I primarily played as Lilith because I thought she was the most versatile character out of the four. Her skill tree can make her into an effective warrior that deals a lot of damage.

The main thing to consider in this review is that I played this game last out of the series even though this was the first in the timeline. Because of this it’s hard to judge a game when you know that the subsequent games of its kind have increasingly gotten better. I do recommend this game for avid Borderland fans, but if you’re into a story with constant action and solids aesthetics in the gameplay then this game may not be a good fit. All in all, it’s a classic, pure and simple."
3544,"absolutly in love with it. great graphics,charachters, gameplay and weapons!"
3545,"Games almost 10 years old now, and STILL has more content then both Destiny 1 and 2 combined. Ignore my steam playtime as I have HUNDREDS of hours between consoles, old and new gen. This is a truly amazing FPSRPG and the starting game to a fantastic series. Borderlands 3 hype! 

10/10"
3546,Looooot!!! 10/10
3547,"Still a classic, even after a decade."
3548,"This game is one of those few games, which made me come back and play more, it is fun, joke here and there, good characters and tons of guns to chose from, I've found my self trying lot of different guns and wasted couple of hours in one specific location after one quest from DLC, but it has its downs as well, you'll have to learn the way of gun play in this game, it can be sometimes very frustrating to land a shot from a sniper, enemies can be sometimes bullet sponges and driving is somewhat good enough. But, if you learn to move around, to enjoy the sick crit you land on a enemy, you'll have a good time playing, and it even has new game plus so hey."
3549,Very Good Game
3550,"played this a while ago but got distracted. came back to give it a good go and now it tells me i missing files which dont get replaced after reinstalls and cache emptying . go online for solution now get a company that says it can replace the missing file for another $20 er sweet. the data for this is from 2014. why are players still suffering this after 4 years. seriously.

That said it is fun to play."
3551,"Hilarious, engaging, and just plain fun, Borderlands is an incredible experience to behold. I still have the DLC to get through, but I can say that playing this game was an absolute blast. 9/10"
3552,a fun shoot em up with a cute and disturbing story
3553,"This is a yes for me though my review will likely have a negative tone. A friend let me play this game a long time ago and I got almost nowhere because I found it slow and boring. Fast forward to BL2 and I played a free weekend and also found that boring but less so. Fast forward again and some friends play BL2 so I join and after the slowish start the game turned into a blast that I ended up beating about 6 times. So I figured I'd go back and play this game before heading to the pre-sequel that seems to be inferior. Sadly unlike BL2 this game's slowness never really lets up, so many improvements were apparently made when making 2 that seem like common sense. Below are some of the big ones for me.

In BL2 you can see you map while selecting a quest, in this game you have to constantly swap tabs which is tedious. It also doesn't show where they're located when you're using a quick travel. The lack of a minimap makes it even worse.

The guns feel so slow and week. The drops are also so random in this game. The last boss dropped weapons worse than what we'd seen at the second boss. Early game whites had better stats than alot of end game blues. Grenades were utterly worthless. Enemies on the mounted guns would destroy my health pool but when I mounted the gun it took a solid 2 mins to kill someone. Rockets sometimes don't hit. For some reason pistols and revolvers are seperate guns. Snipers feel like they have terrible accuracy. Quite a few guns we had only held 2 bullets forcing you to reload all the time. Also the vehicle sucks. Quests that require you to use it are annoying car vs. car fights where you end up pretty thrashed, also a great deal of invisible walls appear to stop you from using it to help with non car quests. Some invis walls even had me driving up and floating in mid air oddly.

Don't regen health out of combat. Instead you need to buy med packs which we forgot to use most of the time. Since grenades rarely hit, and did crap damage when they did we both just kept transfusion grenades the entire time to counter this somewhat.

Special skills and traits didn't seem to change combat up as much. There are alot of crap traits that give exp or money that don't help combat at all so I couldn't be bothered to level.

The quests aren't great either. This compounds with the lack of dialog in the game. In BL2 you got to hear some great voice acting that brought the characters to life while explaining what they wanted you to do for them. The lack of voice acting made the characters feel much less animated. The wall of text would often be ignored since players not picking up the quest couldn't see it without going to their menu. Instead of putting an indicator when there are quests you get spammed to hell by claptrap telling you there's something on a quest board. I ended up picking up most quests just to stop the same freaking claptrap lines from all playing everytime I changed maps. We ended up vastely outleveling most quests and didn't even finish them. Lastly they don't share the same as BL2. One of us d/c'd and lost credit for some quests and all the quests after it in the chain, this forced us to swap hosts and do them again so one player didn't end up missing a ton of exp.

No real overarching story. This was a surprise as well. In 2 there is an obvious enemy to fight, in this game it's just finding the vault. The game plays it off as if the vault may be a myth, but this becomes fairly strange when you start grabbing keys for the damn thing, since it seems like a dead giveaway. In addition even new haven feels kind of empty with the lack of goings on in the area.

Enemies respawn to quickly. We had some respawn right next to us. It's a similar issue to Far Cry 2 if you played that. You can clear an area, then have to clear it again if you walk back through it. Because of the balance of the game you end up fighting a bunch of less than epic small fights repeatedly, where as in 2 you would fight huge camps but once cleared they'd stay that way till the map was reloaded. I prefer the later since it creates some epic firefights.

That all said if you enjoy the borderlands games and haven't gotten this one it is more borderlands. Some of the unique elements can be enjoyable like punching people with Brick, which I enjoyed as a melee option since it felt like a precursor to Kreig in a way. Also I'll say that the DLC's seem to be better quality. They have more voice acting, more varied enemies, decent fights, no car sections so far, and I don't know if it's unique to dlc's but found a shield that quickly regens health taking away some of the complaints."
3554,"The original... I think the intro itself warrants a purchase. Excellent translation of Diablo ARPG style loot with FPS mechanics. Abilities feel great, and all the little skill tree choices feel meaningful and god damn the multiplayer feels good."
3555,"I don't think the game needs a regular review, so I'm just going to explain why the first game is my favorite.

The Pandora of the first Borderlands is an arid junk heap populated with scavengers and cannibals, forgotten and left to rot by the rest of the galaxy. Standing in just about any area of the game gives you the sense of being stuck at the ass-end of nowhere with nothing but the sand and a few dead skags for company. The closest thing you'll see to a civilized settlement is a shanty town surrounded by mountains of garbage. The closest you'll find to friends are self-interested locals who doubt your sanity for chasing a fairy tale (plus one scientist who doubts her own sanity). Nothing works properly, everything is constantly falling apart. Even the more advanced technologies feel clunky and analog, like something out of an 80s sci-fi movie [the DLCs started to introduce more sleek and modern looking tech, a trend which continues in the second game]. It makes for a cohesive, evocative setting that feels inspired by things like Mad Max and Trigun, with a spaghetti western vibe. This atmosphere has gotten a bit muddied and even lost in later entries of the franchise.

The story lacks a strong villain, but I don't think it suffers for it. The game's main antagonist is really Pandora itself. You spend most of your time contending with hostile wildlife, bandit lords, and the occasional ancient ruin. Even when a new villain shows up, let's just say the planet doesn't treat her any better than it treats you. 

The story is kept simple and out of the way. I doubt the game had the budget of its sequel, so there is comparatively little voice acting and almost no cinematics. Most of the details and dialogue are in the quest descriptions themselves, with the occasional bit of VO. There are very few lame plot twists, and nothing like the walking deus ex machina that was Handsome Jack in Borderlands 2. The game is an ARPG, and doesn't have as many pretensions toward 'cinematic' story-telling.

The game is less funny than the sequel. There's still humor, just not as much, and the overall tone is darker. This isn't better or worse, but it does stand out.

The sequel improves the gameplay in some areas. It gets rid of fall damage,  has more interesting skill trees, etc.

other random things I like about the first game:

- Eridian weapons and enemies
- hitting them with your car insta-gibs any enemy in the game, and makes a satisfying squish
- opening containers feels more useful; weapons in chests are better, health and ammo are needed more often
- enemies will often spawn before you reach an area, so sniping is more viable
- more well-placed explosive barrels
- empty, lonely skyboxes
- you can carry around medkits
- Tannis and her neuroses are a bigger part of the story
- General Knoxx was probablly the best DLC in either game
- the second game delivers several different middle fingers to fans of the first game, including killing off characters that you may have liked and seemingly undermining some major plot points. This doesn't belong in this review, I just wanted to say it.

tl;dr First game good, second game good but I don't like it as much.
"
3556,"I love everything about Borderlands but BUYER BEWARE! If you don't want to grind, don't buy the game."
3557,"seems to work pretty well with steam play proton, just a few months ago it would run on proton but was filled with graphical bugs, but those have since been fixed. I havent played enough of it to fully test it, but what I did play ran pretty well. Only thing is fps was a little low I thought but I was running max settings, and that is probably just because the games optimization isnt the best."
3558,"I haven't finished the game yet but its so much fun, co-op works really well and although some of the missions are frustrating due to always going back and forth, having a few friends to play with makes it not so bad. Lilith is best girl 10/10 would perv on again"
3559,"Shoot uglyies, level up, blow stuff up. never gets dull
8/10"
3560,Gameplay is great fun. The guns are great. Story is not good though and the world is too empty. Vehicle controls also could be better. 6/10
3561,"Just get Borderlands 2, you'll get it to run on the same potatoes and it is way better."
3562,lol you cant even change the graphics settings for this game. there are virtually no options...all you have are brightness options and thats it. Sad!
3563,"I started playing the borderlands franchise of games launch day of Borderlands 2, ever since then on my terrible xbox 360 i knew that i found something special. Probably a year after that i decided to grab the predecessor and even though i believe borderlands 2 to be a superior game borderlands has it's own charm and differing game mechanics which give a different and maybe even more fun player experience. 

Recommend a million times over and again."
3564,"Honestly, this is a great game with great gameplay and great graphics and many more. But I just can't go through the next cycle of playthrough with the same or different characters. Despite that, a must buy..!
And yes, the ending sucks."
3565,CL4TR4P SHUT...THE...FUCK...UP
3566,yeet
3567,"This game is by far on all fronts the best Borderlands yet. The skill tree is perfect, the characters are badass, and the story isn't bland and doesn't fall off like its sequels. The feeling of being a cowboy, bounty hunter, and an outright wastlander is unbeatable in any RPG. This game still holds up as one of the best FPS/RPG/Sandbox games up there with FALLOUT 3 and Skyrim. For some reason its sequels lost something in translation (just a little something) with the story writing because the campaing fell off a bit and the side quests were a little bland and some of the boss fights flat out boring. Borderlands was amazing and had way better DLC so it made up for the occasional bullet sponge of a boss here and there. 9.5/10, worth it."
3568,The siren chick has a nice ass I guess
3569,A really great game but I honestly just tried to speed through it so I could play Borderlands 2. But even saying that it was a very fun experience.
3570,"As interesting as it may appear, I don't believe it was necessary to inform the audience that 9 Toes had three balls.
"
3571,"An absolute classic, 100% worthy of $20"
3572,borderlands is a good shooter with nice crisp graphics and interesting chracters and great music nice cards  recommend the DLC too pick it up its getting cheaper.
3573,Cool Game
3574,"*Very Mild Spoilers*
I’m about sixty hours into Borderlands at the time of writing this (probably less, as I’ve been known to leave things running) and I’m nearing the end of the story. 
In my opinion, Borderlands blows its sequel out of the water. 
Sure, Borderlands 2 is a fantastic game. It’s even a better game than Borderlands. That’s why I have over 600 hours in it. But Borderlands is different. It’s less a game, and more an experience. Bl2 was funny, and incredible, and has amazing replayability. But BL1... Well. 
The barren, lifeless grey of dust, and the brown of rock and metal almost exclusively define the colour palette, and the landscape is dotted with buildings almost lovingly cobbled together out of junk, or salvaged from times long past, only standing out of sheer stubbornness. 
Even though there isn’t much voice acting, what is there is usually fits the tone perfectly. My first character is Mordecai, someone who is already tired and resigned, who rarely speaks, and almost never does so in joy. I’ll walk to a catch-a-ride station, and as I jump in a runner, I’ll pause for a minute. “Let’s get our feet out of the dust.”
The music is breathtaking, and it has a lonesomeness that perfectly captures just how tired everyone is. 
In this game, there’s no handsome jack, no voice in your ear, no real antagonist, almost no reason to take another step.
But, through the dirt, it pulls you in. It tangles you up in the meaningless of everything and leaves you wanting more.
 A few days in, I found tanis’s journals. And they broke me. Hearing her go from a happy, inquisitive young scientist to the broken, vault-obsessed recluse you meet in game is one of the most quietly saddening things I’ve ever heard.
About fifty hours in, I drove back to Fyrestone, and walked all the way back to where you get off the bus at the very beginning of the game. The surge of emotions was incredible. 
It’s moments like those that I keep coming back to it for. Standing in the middle of cracked, broken pavement, rock looming behind you, and a night sky without a moon, filling in above you, a void of space so profound it will take your breath away. 

As someone who’s first, and only previous experience with the franchise was Borderlands 2, Borderlands is a masterpiece. I came into it, seeing familiar characters, and wound up realising that I didn’t know them that well, after all. It is a wasteland, and a beautiful one at that. It gets under your skin, pulls you down into the dirt, and sings you a song of longing and sorrow."
3575,I like the psychos.
3576,"[h1]How this game gets all the praise is beyond me[/h1]

[b]TL;DR[/b] - Fetch quest only gameplay, in 2018 still buggy as f*+/ because nobody cared to fix quest-breaking bugs, vast maps are full of enemies, whose shooting in the head is fun only for so long. Game is very easy, there is no real challenge and it has one of wthe worst, boring boss fights ever. If you like mindlessly shooting tons of enemies over and over again, you may like this game.


[b]STORY AND QUESTS[/b]
Story is very basic. You are one of the Vault hunters, looking for fabled Vault that may or may not be on the planet Pandora. Guided by an unknown entity, you make your way forward in pursuit of your life-long dream - to find the Vault. 

It would be fun if it was not hidden behind so many fetch quests. Actually every damn quest in here is a fetch quest - go over there, kill that thing and come back. Then go back and bring some meaningless thing from over there. Then go back to the first location again, kill more things and come back. Rinse and repeat. And when you think section is clear and you move into the new area.. of course more fetch quest in the previous place pops up. BORING AF. Even descriptions are boring, as they use the same childish/crude jokes that usually I like, but in here it gets old really fast.


[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]
Later on you get a car and fast travel system, but still majority of the game you have to run. I believe it was done deliberately to make the game longer, to make you feel like you didn't waste your money on bad game that you could finish playing in 10 hours.

Guns are fun, but all of them feels the same. Guns of the same category use the same sound effect, so there is no real difference between them except damage output and the looks. Also when you use short range weapons like shotguns, you have to come close (logically) but the enemy is able to snipe you with shotgun from 200m afar. Feels bad and frustrating when you die like that and nearest spawn point is 30s of runnig away...


[b]BOSS FIGHTS[/b]
This is so bad it requires its own section. I think the first boss was the hardest. You actually have to move because you are being fired at by the boss himself, while chased by his skaggs. And you are quite low level with bad equipment. But every other boss after that is pure BS. All you have to do is to stand behind a rock so they can't hit you, then shoot at them and kill them. That's it. All the bosses are the same - find a weak spot and shoot it from behind the cover until that bulletsponge dies. What a great gaming experience.


[b]RPG ELEMENTS & MONEY[/b]
RPG leveling and upgrading your character is great, but it makes this already easy-to-beat game even easier. By level 20 you are so overpowered it is disgusting. Combine it with an overpowered weapon that you get failry quickly, because this game gives you everything immediately and nearly for free... and you have a game that only kid would enjoy, because it is so easy.

Weapon proficiency is nice, and if you stick to using one gun you can get strong very fast, as each level gives you better aim, less recoil, more firepower, etc.

Moneywise - after few missions, you have so much money and nothing to spend it on, that actually having currency in this game is pointless.

[b]MUSIC[/b]
Very nice, fits the settings perfectly, unfortunately there are only few tunes. Intro song ""No Rest For The Wicked"" is awesome and I will have to listen to more songs from Cage the Elephant band. Hoppefully they have more good songs like this.

[b]OVERALL[/b]
Great idea, great premises and initially fun gameplay that gets old really quick, then you are drowned under seemingly never ending fetch quests and when you kill the last boss that offers as much challenge and fun as poking a dead squirrel, you feel like it just wasn't worth it. 

And I know back in 2009 we had great games so don't tell me this crap got famous only because ""back then"" it was the best game we had. Come on, folks. In 2009 we got games like Batman Arkham Asylum, Dragon Age: Origins, Brutal Legend, Left 4 Dead 2 and so on... this game is just bad."
3577,"It's a fantastic game! If you are looking for a good multiplayer game to play with friends, this is probably the best game you can choose for that. It's a blast if you have 3 other friends to player, and even then its still fun to play by yourself (although i wouldnt recommend you play it single player) and considering how old it is, it ages very well. Hell, its so good that you dont even have to wait for it to go on sale if you want it, not because of its cheap price, but because its just that good! but there are bugs that can get annoying, and if you unistall the game you lose all of your saves (i learned that the hard way). but overall its extremely good and dare i say, a masterpiece

9.7/10"
3578,This is my favorite Borderlands game. The downloadable content was reasonable and the co-op worked great.
3579,"Simply awesome. Lots of guns, lots of quests, lots of hours sinked in.
Just wish there were more in game feature from BL2 or TPS, like FoV change etc.
Still crazy for either solo or coop.

But BL2 is loads better."
3580,"   [i]Borderlands[/i] sets the stage and introduces the namesake franchise in a well developed way making sure that the player above all else has  fun.  Through a myriad of guns and skills and ways to play the game [i]Borderlands[/i] etches itself as a must-play alone or with friends.  Though there is a fair amount of issues ranging from some annoying repetitiveness and a fair amount of redundant weapons; they do not take away from the enjoyment of the overall game and are at most something to groan mildly about.
"
3581,"Never had such fun in a free world shooter like this, excluding one's like Fallout, on the day I had gotten (back around 2010) and I definitely recommend it.

This is a type of game that won't grow old regardless of how many time's you play and/or beat it."
3582,"Never played an FPS before, (more an RPG guy). Borderlands is not a pure shooter but FPS/RPG hybrid, and it works really well. The learning curve is forgiving, with XP gained from every enemy killed, even failed attempts at a mission and death/respawns will eventually make your character strong enough to succeed.

Every weapon is random, with more variety in stats than even the drops in Breath of the Wild, (Higher damage isn't the only thing!) and everything is customizable from character skills, to even your shield. Enemies have varied weak points, some alien critters have armored heads to punish headshots. Lots of room for strategy. Shooting, yes, mindless, no.

The world is fairly open, a tree-shaped set of main ""crossroads"" and side"" branch"" areas. It holds up well to modern standards, never feeling ""trapped"", (though some valleys turn out to be unreachable scenery.)

10/10 Worth it. Good hunting!"
3583,"i cannot remember anything about this game other than getting stuck inside of a rock and watching in vain as my friend gets yote on over and over again.

probably an accurate pandoran experience."
3584,"Really good game that just gets better the more you play it, would definitely recommend."
3585,"Maybe this is a good game and I'm shallow, but I can't get past the graphics."
3586,"Grind simulator with a classical boring ending. Could have been more fun if the style would be at least more reflected in the music or if the combats would know what they want from me - cover is bad, running heads first is bad... I would rather play DOOM for an action FPS."
3587,"Some things are better than 2, but its still a bit less polished. Nevertheless, its still a lot of fun and definitely worth checking out"
3588,"I admit Borderlands 1 It's nos as good as the other games in the series, but it has some features that makes the experience more remarkable than in the other games. The weapons proficiency system, for example, works better than the badass tokens for giving the impression you are actually climbing a ladder of skill with your weapon, and the game also has chalenges(but they give you experience instead of tokens, wich make this game more complete in this aspect).

The scenario is another strong feature. More than in BL2, here you have the sensation of standing in a place where nothing works as it should, where society, and everything about it is precarious. And finally, BL 1 seems to be more balanced about how much experience is available before you take on the main missions. This makes this game's dinamics incredibly fun. Also, claptrap always warns you about where there are missions available.

Conclusion: Even if BL2 and the Pre Sequel are better, you shouldn't throw away BL1. It's unique in several ways that the other games were never able to reproduce. Any fan of Borderlands universe shoud try it."
3589,"It's ok and fun, it's simple and makes for a good co-op game. It runs on anything made in 2012 onwards.

Worth a punt when on offer."
3590,Very good RPG-shooter. Perfect for coop. I really liked it and spent much time with pleasure and adrenaline rush. Thanks a lot from Serious Sam fan :)
3591,"I first purchased Borderlands for the Xbox 360 & again when I became more active on Steam.

As you progress through Borderlands, the randomly generated gear & cool loot plays a huge role in customizing your character, a treasure-hunter (AKA Vault-Hunter): first, you select from four classes (the Berzerker, Hunter, Siren, or Soldier), each of which has three skill-trees you can choose skills from as you level-up. 

Throughout the game, you can collect revolvers, shotguns, rocket-launchers, SMGs, snipers, pistols (fully automatic machine-pistols as well as peashooters), & rifles (semi-automatic, fully automatic, & burst-fire) or simply sell them at vending machines for cash to buy ammo or more guns; some guns fire standard bullets while others inflict acid-damage, fire-damage, shock-damage, & explosive damage! 

Plus, each gun-company specializes in producing different guns: for example, Jakobs' guns are powerful but fire slowly (""If it took more than one shot, you weren't using a Jakobs!"") whereas Vladof's guns fire quickly with poor accuracy (""You don't need to be a better shot, you just need to shoot more bullets!"").

In addition to the awesome amount of firearms in Borderlands, you find a variety of shields: they can increase your maximum health, grant resistance to the elemental types listed above, regenerate your health when you're wounded, explode & cause damage to nearby enemies, etc.

To counter the variety of guns & gear you get, Borderlands also offers a myriad of enemies, including suicidal psychos, hulking Bruisers, feral hounds, armed Bandits with guns, automated turrets, armoured military-soldiers, flying Rakk, oversized leeches, Spiderants, enraged midgets, & more.

Regarding the writing, I'll only say the game's quirky humour entertained me immensely &, unfortunately, the story's conclusion proves lackluster (though the journey is definitely worth the destination in this case). 

I highly recommend purchasing the Game of the Year Edition of this game, if you decide to buy it: it includes one of my favorite DLC (the Zombie-Island of Dr. Ned), & one of the other DLC (the Secret Armoury of General Knoxx) rectifies the disappointing ending mentioned above."
3592,ive tried reinstalling and everything everytime i try to paly it says i have a whole bunch of files missing
3593,"GREAT GAME!!!! LOTS OF FUN, LOTS OF HUMOR AND SH*T TONS OF GUNS!!! Story and side missions are interesting, and a big plus for new game plus+!!!"
3594,Nut bad
3595,love this
3596,Best gen of Borderlands of all
3597,yes
3598,"Fun game, the classes are very unique, but have a lot of flexibility with how you can play them. All the travel gets a little old, but blasting enemies and pickling up shiny guns never gets old."
3599,"I recently played this game and I can't be more thankful about it. From the beginning I felt like this game is something else, that the mechanics ( even though not too complicated ) are great, that the story is going to be great. Even though the get is repetitive at points I've seen worse, way worse.
The graphics hold up pretty good for an almost ten year old game, but I guess that's because of the cosmics like drawing. 
I encountered a few problems here and there, I had a few frame drops when the game has to load too many enemies in a larger area, but nothing game-breaking. The sound is ok, not great and the voice acting is good. 
Overall I would give this game a 9/10 and would recommend to anyone to play it.

"
3600,"An absolute gem. I have spent many nights playing this game with friends till morning time.(before I owned it on steam xD) it's a mix of FPS elements with basic RPG elements, a lot of exploration, tons of guns and it will keep you busy for hours. Definitely worth getting the DLC's as well to extend gameplay. 

I.E. it is worth it. so do yourself a favour and buy it. In fact, Buy a four pack for yourself and your mates."
3601,"The game that awoke me as an intense gamer. Played this game when it first came out as a little kid, loved it and continued to visit it back throughout the years.
Borderlands is in my personal opinion the best in series for a multitude of reasons.
1st: The tone, while still having that jokey nonsensical vibe it was darker and more serious, bandits were a real threat, pandora was a shit hole full of trash and dumping zones, and chances are you were gonna die or go mad. Future games ride the full joke train and in some ways loose the attitude of dark humor.
2nd: Scaling was natural, flowed rightly and forced you to play side quests, not all of them but enough. In future games I always found that if you did all the quests chances were you were vastly overpowered for the upcoming fight and just made it fall to the wayside somewhat.
3rd: Loot, guns were handled better here, enemies could drop any loot but chances remain that chests dropped the best, making chest looting actually worth it
4th: Simple story, while this may or may not be a good thing borderlands 1 prime story was far simpler on the surface. You are a vault hunter looking for a vault, your not out to topple a dictator or be the hero, you are a mercenary for better or for worse. You may not be evil but you sure as hell ain’t good and borderlands drives this in, hinting at angel, the fearsome power of the Atlas corporation, to the mysterious ghosts of the vault.

Ok time for the review

+Great funny story and fantastic side quests each with their own unique story and twist.
+The guns oh Lordy the guns! So many types, so many uses! So much give!
+ Enemies, many different, unique and special. While you will see every enemy again the game introduces them at a rate that valences this allowing for both old strategies to be used and some on the fly
+ Bosses/Baddasses. Jerez so unique each with their own attack, charm and malice. From side bosses to main ones each is a challenge and a joy to face
+Awesome skills, 
+Bricks exploding punches
+Weirdly good driving by weirdly bad car combat
+ Hub worlds that mean something and progressing towns. 
=Enough changing  scenery 

For the bad
-Bad car combat
- Some areas walking can be a pain (specifically the caves, and rust yards)
- Corrosive while a better fire has little prime usage, good but no specific moment
- Mordecais ability to shoot through shields

Overall the game for me is a 10/10 and one I gift to other people to just to see their experiences with the game first hand! Cannot recommend enough!"
3602,"Played it a bit, its pretty good."
3603,I AM AN INSANE PSYCHO! 10/10 great game.
3604,"This game can either be fun, or a crappy, dated, and lifeless game, but it really depends on who you are. Let me explain.
The Borderlands franchise as a whole is great, but this game is more of a building block to which Borderlands 2 built off of and elaborated on. 

Borderlands 1 has fairly dated graphics, very litle voice acting for missions (To understand what's really going on you have to read the text once starting and completing a mission), really low FoV, some performnace issues, and just overall weird bugs/mechanics. 

So why do I recommned this game? Simple. The game was great for it's time and overall, it's not a *bad* game so to speak, as much as it's an old classic. If you're coming from Borderlands 2 and playing this game after, you might find yourself disappointed and saying, ""Why do people like this and how was Borderlands 2 based off of this?"" But if you play this game first or appreciate classic games, I'd surely recommend picking this up. As a Borderlands fan who played a lot of BL1 and BL2 on console, it's nice to go through and experience an old masterpiece that started it all.

I wouldn't recommend buying if it's not on sale though. I got GOTY edition for 7.50 USD, and I'd recommend you wait for a similar sail.

TL;DR: Borderlands 1 is a classic, but not perfect game that has obvious flaws which can either be appreciated or shunned. If you're coming from Borderlands 2, you might find yourself disappointed. Either way, if you plan on buying this I'd recommend waiting for a sale."
3605,"Quite repetitive and boring. After a couple of hours it is all the same. Storyline is ok but nothing original.
Kinda fun but honestly cannot recommend it."
3606,Played this through after playing borderlands2 first and this just felt abit numb to me as there were no cut scenes and not many funny jokes like bl2 had but heard the dlc's are good so going to come back and give them a try at somepoint
3607,"An amazingly good game.
Even IF my copy broke, I still had tons of fun getting to play the PC version and just lose myself in its environments.
I do not have many problems with it, but I do have one or two
First off, my copy broke, and I'm down to the last fix, which I had to contact 2K to been get
Second, I did run into one or two bugs that made me start an entire quest over, one of which a story mission
Third - I can barely find anyone to play with. :(
And lastly
It ended. I want more. This game is so good.

If you want a loot-grinder that started one of the best story driven shooters made so far, get Borderlands. It will show you where it began.



And then afterthatg, get the seconds because holy hell does it improve practically everything"
3608,"FOV game me motionsickness, no wawy to change it in menu."
3609,"Love this game - it's a classic. To me, it really hit a lot of points that the newer games forgot about. Power creep doesn't exist in this installment to the degree it does in the future ones, so you can get insanely overpowered if you farm gear and that's a good thing. That being said if you played much of BL2, there's some missing polish in this game you may miss due to its age. Still a timeless classic that helped define the loot-and-shoot genre."
3610,"After you download the game, there is a problem with the files, you will get a notification for a 'general protection fault'

What you do is copy the culdart.dll file that is located in Steam\SteamApps\common\Borderlands\Binaries, you paste the file and rename it to physxcudart_20.dll then verify the game!

[u]About this review[/u]
I have previously written reviews for the 4 different dlcs available to Borderlands and therefore will only lightly speak about them and focus on the base game and the GOTY-edition as a whole. Personal experience will be shared and in the end an overview and conclusion of the GOTY-edition will be made.

Already here I will state that I always recommend buying the ""GOTY-edition"" on a sale as the price befits this aging game at around 9,99€ very well in my opinion. I also recommend [u]permanently deleting[/u] ""Borderlands"" if you bought it stand alone if you intend to get the dlcs as you can then buy the GOTY-edition which is not available to owners of Borderlands. In my experience the GOTY-edition is generally cheaper than Borderlands standalone at sales and the same goes for the dlcs.
This might not always be true so check carefully before purchasing. (remember that you can ask for a refund in worst case, within 14 days and less than 2 hours played). This is also one thing I am very critical about, as there are many different bundles and some are sadly straight rip offs... 
[u]You have been warned![/u]

[h1]Personal Experience, 75 hours Solo Blitz[/h1]
[b]Borderlands[/b] is a fantastic game which introduced a new kind of RPG/Shooter.
With its unique painted graphic, loot generating sytem, aswell as Co-Op love with focus on rewarding multiplayer, it quickly became a well loved game. 
I first played this game on PC around its release and later on xbox 360 Co-Op with my brother.

However that was a long time ago and for the most part I have played ""Borderlands 2"", its sequel.
Why then make this review?
I recently bought Borderlands and played about [u]75 hours[/u] (68 on my profile since I played a bit offline) spread over 16 day till I [u]100%[/u] making it an average of almost 5 hours a day...

I remember a lot of it from the past and for the first time I have reached the max level of 69 and beaten every dlc and completed every mission available through all of the dlcs with the exception of the second playthrough for Moxxi, Claptrap and Doctor Ned dlcs.

My main goal was to relive Borderlands and quickly finish of all of the achievements. 
To get the Co Op and multiplayer achievements I LAN:ed with myself [b]lol[/b].

As with ""Borderlands 2"", the difficulty increases with more players and as a reward better loot [u]should[/u] appear.
This was very true as I waltzed throught the first playthrough until I added another player and entered ""Old Haven"", it was not easy anymore! It was even clearer with the ""Spiderants"" where occasionally some ""Badasses"" would spawn solo, three immediately spawn like all the time when just playing with another player.
Unlike ""Borderlands 2"" I have never played [u]4 players[/u] in Borderlands, but expect it to be the most enjoyable experience. 

I did play the whole game solo in truth and enjoyed it, but would [b]strongly[/b] advise playing Borderlands with at least one other player. It is more fun than solo and is much more manageble than playing 4 players in general.

[h1]Borderlands as a base game (mostly)[/h1]

With the base game alone the level caps at 50/51 and you can complete 50/51 achievements of the total 80 available.
Completion estimate is 40-50 hours.
Despite the store page telling you about vehicle combat like it is a main feature, the truth is that there only exists [u]one vehicle[/u] in the base game, that is available to the player and it is quite [b]fragile[/b], in other words: do not have high expectations on the vehicular combat.
The story and the core gameplay is solid, but really feels most [b]complete[/b] with the dlcs through the [u]GOTY-edition[/u].

One thing that not even the dlc can save Borderlands from is the [b]""barren ladscape""[/b] and the amount and variation of enemies. Sure it gets better with the dlcs but at the end of the day a more colourful settings and variation to the landscapes would have been great. (This is a lot better in Borderlands 2)
The graphic is [b]good[/b] at best, when playing at the highest available settings and should be expected of an aging game like this.

A big part of the game and what set Borderlands apart when released was the loot rng system.
I personally like finding and trying a lot of different weapons but later in the game it felt overwhelming. 
Borderlands 2 felt easier when it comes to gear. Most of the weapons in this game has to be tried to truly feel how good they are. The stats even feel a bit missleading, especially when it comes to the legendary weapons.
What I am trying to say is that the loot will start to drain you after a while, learn to early familiarize yourself with how different weapons and attachment behave to make it easier. Otherwise you can mod to increase your storage, which [u]I do not recommend[/u]. The [b]bank[/b] (Moxxi DLC) is another option.

It was fun reliving [b]Borderlands[/b] again and I really [u]Recommend it[/u].
[b]Borderlands 2[/b] is basically better in every way and fixes many of the mentioned flaws, but without playing Borderlands, the sequel will not feel as appreciated as the story builds around the first game a bit.

3613,"Borderlands offers you to join a Mad-Max-like universe with guns, machines and monsters, and it feels really badass. The atmosphere is a very nice mix of humour, craziness and cynism, although the psychology of the characters pushes this aspect much further in the following episodes.

Gameplay-wise you have here a hybrid between FPS and RPG, with four classes and coherent skill trees, nothing to say here except that everything is well thought. As in classic RPGs, fighting will give you loot, or you can buy weapons with the money you collect from main and secondary missions. Everything is well-balanced (xp progression, enemy power as you advance through the game...), except maybe that it is rather common to find the better loot during missions, making the selling machines kinda useless.

It is to be noted that the game is quite long, especially if you do all the side missions, and even more with the DLCs. Don't pay attention to my hour count, I played a long time on a hard copy before registering it into Steam. I believe it took me no less than 30 hours to reach the end of the game (doing side missions all along) and the two DLCs I went through (Dr. Ned and General Knoxx) were additional 5 to 10 hours long each, I would say.

Last but not least: you should know that the essence of the game is the multiplayer. As a single player it is ""just"" a good game, but as a crew of 4 you can cooperate to do the whole game together and this is definitely a blast.

Highly recommended, like the 2 and the pre-sequel."
3614,10/10
3615,Loved it
3616,"I would say ""THIS IS THE BEST BORDERLANDS EVER"" but i aint youch playing this on my ps3 for the first time anymore and i lost my save..... what i will say though this is a very good game besides the no vsync setting that you have to manually adjust in the unreal settings.... i had a blast playing this for a very long time....on ps3 anyway... with my brother and some friends if your going to get it mind it is a bit dated now and also the fov and vsync is a pain haha other than that though fantastic!"
3617,"Ninja edit (19.01.2019): I started playing the game again, had alot of fun, but realised that after reaching max level it was not fun to try to survive anymore. By luck I found out that you can go to: C:\Users\User\Documents\My Games\Borderlands\WillowGame\Config and find a place where it says: ""Demigod=false"". If you put it on ""true"" you will not be able to die. I did this to finish Crawmerax and the Circle of Duty. Even with this on it took a really really long time to finish both Crawmerax especially! Also you still run out of ammo..., and your weapons are still really underpowered. 

Now for the review:

I'm quitting this game at level 65. I can't take it anymore. It's not worth it...

Here is the explanation why.
I have played this game for 64 hours now, and I've had tons of fun, but there are two sides of the coin, and I will now explain.

First and foremost, I WILL recommend this game, but only the original game, without the DLCs (except Zombie one).

The original game, without the DLCs offer a great selection of weapons, enemies, quests and locations, and is really fun. You kill enemies, bosses and you gain loot; better weapons, shields and guns. There is also a possibillity to upgrade your ammo stash for the different guns. Absolutly great fun there! The claptraps, and much of the humour is also hilarious.

The Zombie DLC:
After completing the game, I got a new option for my character was shown as ""playthrough 2"". I entered it, and I could play all over again with my levelled character. I went crazy, because now I had all the skills, and it was so fun. I started the Zombie DLC, and it was soooo fun to blast away the Zombies coming at you. Weird story, but it was fun. Recommend this actually!

After finishing the first DLC, I finished the game again and did all the missions. Had lots of fun!

T-Junction / Tasarus Station (the bad stuff):
When I entered T-juntion I was looking forward to seeing a new story, meet new fun NPCs and gain more loot. I picked up the main quests, and set out for some fun. In the T-junction DLC you get to use different vehicles, and there are long roads between the questhubs, which is makes the first problem.

Some of you will probably say git good, some will ask why I don't play with friends, but I did this alone, and that's how it is.
Suddenly after playing the game A LOT of hours, finishing it twice, and doing the zombie DLC too, my guns stopped working on the enemies I faced. I shot them in the head 20 times before they died, and every single one of them could now oneshot me. My trusted gun hardly did any damage, and I was puzzled. As I went on, I kept dying, and dying and dying and dying and dying and dying...while almost every single enemy I met were as strong as a boss in the original game. 

Also I started seeing a pattern. The missions also started to come in random order, so I had to go back and forth again, killing the same enemies over and over and OVER again! Shooting a single enemy with the shotgun (the only weapon that really worked) in the head 20 times before they died was really boring. It's not git good, my weapons doesn't work. So what happends when you shoot an enemy 20 times in the head before he dies? You run out of ammo, and what's left then? The weapons that hardly does any damage. 

OMG! When I killed one of the bosses at the end of the T-junction DLC, I had 0 ammo left (with every upgrade possible), and had to run around and wait for my gun to reload. Absolutly horrible.

Also the enemies that you face level with you, but not at the same level, at least 1-2 levels higher. I checked the very last boss in the T-junction, and it had increased with 3 levels when I levelled one. SHIT. I left the T-junction after many angry hours, with the last quest I got was ANOTHER grinding quest. Kill 200 of these monsters.

SO I went to Tasarus Station, really pissed, but glad to see something new. I played it for maybe an hour before I exited the game and started writing this review. MORE GRINDING QUESTS! Wtf?

................

TO END THIS ANGRY RANT.

I loved the original game, I liked the Zombie DLC, but unless you are playing with friends, STAY THE F*U*C*K OUT OF THE T-junction DLC. It will just drive you insane!

...

The final achievements:
There are two kinds of achievements you will sit with at the end. Arenas and pickups. I did the first arena (the gully) alone at level 69 with godmode on, and it took 6 hours. Don't do this alone! The ideal way of doing it is to have a low level character (18-20) to host the game, and then invite someone at level 60+. Then it will take a bit over 2 hours.

For the pickup/items achievements where you need to pick up panties, 3d glasses, pizza, robot parts, oil and bobbleheads. What you do (godmode or not) is to go to the last boss in the robot expension pack MINAC, and instead of shooting the robots he spawn one by one, you just shoot them before they even spawn at the door spawn point of the boss. You will be able to get 10 robot kills/drops instead of only 4. Another way of doing this is to find a safe spot behind a stone, let your computer stay online, while you do something else (sleep?), and after at least 10 hours there will be alot of loot, and probably all the required items. I didn't do this, because I think it's boring to not do everything on your own.

Those last achievements are bullshit achievements, and I would rather have spent my time trying other characters than using 10 hours (at least!) on arena and another 6 (at least) hours on the pickup achievements."
3618,"The original Borderlands is my favorite by far of the franchise.  It holds a clear story line with a nice collection of side quests to help advance through the game.  The drops from killing enemies or treasure chests are exiting and varied.  The expansion modules are a little bit weaker than the primary game, but far better than Borderlands 2"
3619,"I have played about 20 hours.....Here are some pros and cons :-

Pros::--
1. A decent story
2. huge map
3. lots of enemies
4. tons of guns.....damn
5. FPS but has RPG elements

Cons::--
1. u may feel it's gameplay repetitive
2.graphics.....but this is a 2009 game, so I think that's not a problem 
3. no vsync...u may suffer terrible screen tearing

that's all...
overall rating - 8/10"
3620,"great game, and great port to pc"
3621,Astrology.
3622,"Great game. While it isn't as grand as it's sequel, it still offers a solid and lengthy experience."
3623,"I've made the mistake of playing BL2 before BL1.

The entire aesthetic of the Borderlands universe is very unique as far as FPS go. If I had to describe this game in two words: gun p0rn. I have no idea how many different guns/shields are there, and it's great. It gives the players a whole lot of options to pick whatever weapons, mods or COMs suit their combat style the best.
The humour and the characters in this game deserve the most praise. Claptrap is just the perfect comic relief, and all NPCs throughout the game were actually interesting. The humour was refreshing, it really made the game so much more fun and brought life to it.
Although, I felt kind of alone in the game - in BL2 even the random NPC banter made the world feel much more alive. In BL1 there's little to no interraction with the player, aside from mission briefings or occasional ECHOs. Borderlands is supposed to feel like you're in a dangerous wasteland, but you're not supposed to feel like you're completely alone in it -- this ain't Fallout lol.

There are, however, some things that really annoyed me. The menu - it took quite some time to actually get used to it, the design was really confusing at first and it's inelegant. I also really disliked the fast-travel stations - the list of locations was just odd, I would very much prefer to see an actual map. This is something that was done perfectly in BL2.
The Vault Hunters don't really show a lot of their character in BL2, we don't know a whole lot about them (aside from the missions where you collect ECHOs with their backstories), but in BL1 it feels like the Vault Hunters have little to no personality. It would have been great if these characters were explored much more.
The thing that I disliked a lot was the final boss fight. [spoiler] It felt like the game was a dicktease: after all that build-up, shooting through bandits and mercs, dealing with Crimson Lance and such, you just fight a giant kraken-like one-eyed tentacle monster and that's it. No closure, nothing. Commander Steele was supposed to be the main antagonist of the story, yet she's there at the end for like 10 seconds before she dies.[/spoiler] That was a very weak ending.
The DLCs are always great. I love how in both BL1 and BL2 the DLCs are always over-the-top, whether it's the Claptrap's New Robot Revolution, or Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep. Fellas at Gearbox are aware of how silly these DLCs are and they clearly had a lot of making them. I had just as much fun playing.

BL1 is like a larvae stage that you gotta go through before the amazing gaming experience that is BL2. Still, a fun game nonetheless."
3624,This is one of my favorite games of all time.  It is just enjoyable to play.  I go back and play through the entire thing every couple of years.
3625,i like the gameplay but i hate how noone play it anymore
3626,"This is quite honestly Borderlands at it's finest. Althought I love BL2, this game holds a ton of of nostalgia for me. Most people will have issues with quite a bit in this game. Such as having to constanlty press E to pick stuff up(or X on the xbox controller). In 2009 though, this was all we knew and it was loads of fun and still is.

So if you are able to look past the lack of quality of life improvments from BL2, Borderlands has alot to offer. The four default characters you get in this game each bring something to the table with varying playstyles for everybody. Berserker, Siren, Solider and Sniper. If I were to rank these classes for someone by a scale of fun, It would be 1.Siren 2.Berserker 3.Solider 4.Sniper. That's all opinion of course. 

I think the current asking price of 19.99 on steam is a bit much concidering you can walk into gamestop and pick up a copy for much less than that on xbox 360 but (pc is superior). As with anything on steam, wait for a sale when its 9.99 or 4.99 or something, don't get me wrong the game is worth every penny. It's just that this game is almost 10 years old at this point.

Bottom line, get it anyway you can, play it, support Gearbox so we can get Borderlands 3."
3627,"I tried to like this game, I really did. But in the end, I just don't. I'm currently level 41 Siren (Lilith), I finished main story and The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned DLC and that's it, I cannot bring myself to complete the rest of addons. Why? This game is boring. It's just endless shooting and using the only skill you have. It could be enough, if any part of this game would be done properly. FPS part is medicore due to weak AI of opponents and weapon accuracy mechanic. This was literally the biggest pain. Every weapon, which had less than 90% accuracy, was useless. 

And the RPG part? Comparsion to Diablo 2 is an insult for Blizzard. You get few builds, but it's just upgrade for your skill or your class-preferred weapon. This gets me to loot, which should be main interest. Well... After something about 35 hours I found only five or less legendary weapons. And if I found one, it was worse than the one I already had. I feel like rarity of weapons doesn't matter at all – or required level. I had some blue 14 level AR for half of the game. Also I found only two Eridian weapons, if I do not count Eridian artifacts – which to be honest looked also useless. For my class their main usage was to add elemental damage at ability usage. Again this leads me to another cririque. Elemental damage wasn't explained anywhere. I had to read few articles, how that actually works and I'm still not sure after dozen of hours. 

This all could have been forgotten, if Borderlands had a good story. This is my biggest disappointment. I was shocked how shallow it was and how anticlimatic the ending was. I got so hyped after that one of the best intros I've seen in a game. Unfortunately, intro, graphics and occasional humor are the only good things about this game. 

I keep thinking if this game was released long time ago, where it could've been revolutionary. But the thruth is, this game was released two years after Mass Effect. There's no excuse.

Also please note, that I played this game solo and with only one class. Multiplayer could make this game a lot better and more fun, same goes for different class."
3628,Still quite playable in 2k20.
3629,"Best norderlands ever made, borderlands 2 was close but this one is definatly better."
3630,"Unlike the follow-up entries, this game is almost as entertaining alone as it is with friends. Without DLCs however, it is only fit for a single playthrough with each class. The DLCs add much needed variety though, so if you want to spend more than a few dozens of hours playing, you should go for the GOTY."
3631,"Meh, 8 hours in and I feel like not much has changed, too repetitive"
3632,Great game that has aged well.
3633,"Extremely boring, every quest I did in my hour and a half playing was a fetch quest, and they were all for the main story."
3634,"This game is flaming shit its grind for bigger numbers in a wasteland so void of uniqueness or anything fun,sure its fun with frirnds but boiling alive can be fun with friends still wouldnt reccomend it"
3635,"Very fun FPS. Story is not legendary but still ok. It resembles Fallout a bit. Overall, an awesome experience and a recommended shooter game."
3636,Running Simulator
3637,"If you do not own/enjoy this game. I need to why. Seriously.
I can understand if you don't like the FPS aspect of it. Other than that. I don't know what's not to love.
[list]
[*]Cell-shaded animation, for a more hand-painted feel in the graphics
[*]All weapons are randomly generated. You'll never pick up the same weapon twice.
[*]Interesting Storyline. To say the very least.
[*]Interesting Characters. Hilarious to boot!
[*]Hilarious Dialouge. Seriously, some of the stuff they say in game will have your sides hurting.
[*]Challenging Multiplayer. The enemies get harder, the more people you have join you. (Limit of 4, total)
[*]Offline Play. This is a big deal for me in most of my games. I don't have steady access to internet.

This is a solid 9/10. Seriously, get it. Stop wasting your life.

3639,9/10 I LOVE IT
3640,"TLDR:
Pros:

-Very Replayable
-Diverse weapons
-Fun every time around
-Even more fun with friends to dick around with
-Rewarding
-Good mix between feeling like a badass and challenge
-Chaotic weapon RNG with weapon parts 
-Ar's are viable<<<
-Basically almost anything is viable if you build accordingly
-Amazing kick off to the story that is the Borderlands series
-Easy to run

-Cons:

-Crappy POV which if you google it can be changed via config
-Not a huge online PB
-Not the best graphics (But you know what they say graphics don't make the game.)

For me since I like the game so much there might be things I haven't listed that you might not like so be aware of that. For me I have to think real hard to come up with cons of this game since mostly it has been surrounded by good.
   


Full Review:

Great game and a lot of replayablity you won't go one time through this and get the same mediocre weapons over and over again like BL2. There is a good portion of randomness to the looting but soo many weapons to chose from. Not to mention you will get some usable and even great purple and blue weapons even viable in late game. This game is one I can't reccomend enough. As for the story it's the beginning of a great one if you have only played BL2 I really suggest you give this game a chance. You will find that even with the bad FOV which you can change just look it up this game is great and even better than 2. Sure BL2 was good the first 10-15 playthroughs (at least for me) were fun but after that it just gets boring getting the same crap over and over again. But not with this game. 

   As for the gunplay it's great and feels so much better than TPS or BL2 this game actually makes you feel like a bonified badass with if you know how to build your character or know what build you are going for and build your character accordingly you will make the wasteland tremble before you(I reccomend going for a Professional COM based Dahl wielding Siren Build) but I digress. The only thing I have negative to say about this game is that I wish there was a 3rd playthrough to slay around on for after you hit max level and want to test your arsonal on a new playthrough of madness. That is one thing BL2 did that I liked. 

All in all this game is old but gold and well worth buying.

Happy Hunting Vault Hunters!"
3641,"A must buy I guess?
Welp, if you already played diablo, torchlight, destiny, and warframe, you will probably like this game. 
Basically, this game is an fps loot fest. Also, this game have different characters so you will probably play this game over and over again. Listen to others, play this game first before playing borderlands 2."
3642,"Borderlands is by far one of the most revolutionary FPS RPGs of all time.

Borderlands 2 does almost everything Borderlands did, except better, with the exclusion of the weapons proficiency system, which I really like in this game.

The menus in this game can be a little unintuitive in this game, but you do get used to them.

The graphics are a little rough around the edges, especially compared to later games in the series.  They just don't render well at lower resolution.

The game runs well on SteamPlay barring a few crashes.  This is good news for Linux users, and people wanting to buy SteamOS based Steam Machines in the near future.   Hopefully the crashes will be fixed in future releases of Proton."
3643,a wery good game best play with friends  a nice story line some things to laught about :) totaly recomend how ever its better to play in order border lands pre sequal first then this then borderlands 2  to make storyline more make sense :)
3644,"I shouldn't need to look at a ""Tweaking"" guide to make the game not look like ass right off the bat. There no advanced graphical settings, so you are stuck with the jaggy lines and poor textures that make it look like it was an early access PS2 game unless you screewing with the game folder file settings, which you SHOULDN'T need to do. 

I know this game is old, but this is ridiculous to not even had grapical options on the steam prefrences page for the game."
3645,"I love it, as I do most things Borderlands, but it feels a little... empty. there's a bit of a lack of variety in creatures and baddies this time around. It's also just not as nice to look at as BL2. It kinda looks the same wherever you go, whereas BL2 has a large variety of colorful locales. I know I just made it sound like I DON'T love it, but there are some really good pros too. The laser weapons are awesome. I also loved the addition of Cryo damage, very cool. The backstory is nice as well, and answers a lot of questions that BL2 had me asking. I really liked the player characters. Especially Athena. Overall, I'd say that the pre-sequel is a great game, even if it doesn't quite measure up with its predecessor."
3646,good game!
3647,iz good 13/10
3648,Like borderlands 2 but without the 2
3649,Don't play this game if you have played Borderlands 2 first.
3650,"Instead of playing this game, go try to reach center of the earth with a plastic spoon. You will get same experience. The story barely exists like my will to live after playing this game. All you can do shot somethings with awful guns and keep grinding rest of the game.

0/10"
3651,"This game is loads of fun, and this is coming from someone who typically doesn't care much for shooter games. You should give it a shot (har har). Interesting story, creative characters, insane weapons, loads of fun!!"
3652,"Immediately fell in love with this game!

Everyone loves random loot generators and this game is a prime example of that and always has you grinding for better gear!

A perfectly design mix of 3D comicbook style and every character will grab your eye with detail!

Storyline is really interesting and grabs you immediately with it's outstanding storytelling.

Sound engine is awesome and plays flawlessly towards your immersion.

Get this game and all the other borderlands as well at full price but you will see this title on sale often! Also this game is x10 the fun with friends!
"
3653,rooty tooty point and shooty for the story and every gun mmo ever for the endgame. pretty good.
3654,good game
3655,"Borderlands 1 is that one game that I go to whenever i'm bored and I just want to have fun, regardless of story. If you're looking for a story, it's not here. The loot system is fun because you can just get a random legendary from anywhere. Toward the end of the game, you have these really powerful weapons that just melt anyone that's in your way. I've even had a few weapons that lasted me over ten levels and they were still doing better than most weapons that were dropping. The only real challenge is Crawmerax. If you don't know what you are doing against him/ you are playing by yourself, he's a pain to kill. Again, I mainly just play this game whenever I just wanna feel overpowered."
3656,Very fun.
3657,"Slow clunky RNG crap with shitty controls and fov that didn't age well at all, it wasn't even good when it came out."
3658,"I thouroughly enjoyed its campain,b still stuck at the boss level though. The dialouge between the player and the npc's is less than optimal, and it could've used a little bit more color. The gameplay mechanics were nearly flawless without a single glitch, bug, etc. that i've seen. 9.5/10"
3659,nicu game
3660,Fun game. Nuff said.
3661,"So I see that people sometimes try and put cool titles in their reviews, something to catch the eye and really reel in those big review views. So I'm going to test a few out here before jumping into the meat of what I have to say. Don't worry, what I actually have to say about Borderlands is plenty stupid so you're not missing out if you just stop at these bad titles.

BAZILLIONS OF GUNS AND A SIMILAR NUMBER OF HOURS

BRICK'S MAGICAL PUNCH QUEST

THE FUN, ZANY GAME ABOUT HOW BEING A LITTLE PERSON ALSO MAKES YOU CRAZY

Alright sweet, hoping one of those caught a few eyes.

Anyway, Borderlands is a very fun game. It is, however, a game that can be fun in a couple of different ways that I'm afraid may be completely incompatible. But we're definitely getting a little ahead of ourselves, let's just start on the most quintessentialy Borderlands part of Borderlands: the graphics. It's no great secret that this game has a pretty wonderful aesthetic. I can't imagine this series would have been able to achieve the same degree of popularity with the original art direction, which just kind of looked like every other shooter to come out at that time. Much like Wind Waker, the shift in art direction afforded Borderlands not only a look that set it apart from other similar games at the time but still looks good nearly a decade later. So good job Gearbox, you future-proofed the look of your game. High-five.

The writing is a similarly often-praised point in Borderlands, so much so that when the Telltale series was announced it seemed like a very natural fit. I mean sure, they also did a series for Minecraft, a game without dialogue, but shut up I guess. Anyway, the writing is pretty strong in Borderlands. Yeah you never really care about anyone ever (okay, I have a soft spot for T.K Braha but in terms of emotional connections that's about the extent of it), but most of the dialogue is pretty witty and even got a few laughs out of me. It never really reaches the same quality as 2, but overall I'd call it heads and tails above most video game writing.

But onto the actual gameplay. I'd be really surprised if you didn't already know that Borderlands was a Diablo-like FPS, with a heavy emphasis on leveling and loot drops to define the strengths of your character. All the usual trapping are here, including the usual color coding for different tiers of loot and respawns that merely reset your character and cost money rather than reset the world as most games of other genres do. The gameplay is absolutely, one hundred percent fine for what it is, but due to the hybrid nature of it I can't really praise the gunplay above other shooters that don't rely on RPG elements, and the Diablo-like elements lack the same depth that a lot of other titles in that genre have (Torchlight being one of my favorite examples from the same time period). I was definitely having fun while playing it (even burned through all the DLCs) but I can't imagine a world where I play through this game again.

Now for where the real issue sets in. There are two different priorities that a player can have while playing Borderlands, and they're kind of at odds with one another. There are definitely going to be some players here because of the setting, the writing and just the general world vibe, and others who are here to loot their way up to god tier guns. Most if not all players are going to hold both of these elements in some esteem, but which of the two hold more can seriously impact the way in which someone plays the game. This really only impacts multiplayer, but it can be really annoying if you're trying to absorb the quest dialogue and most of the party is ready to go collect 12 psycho nuts or whatever. Conversely if you want to go grab better guns I'm sure it's just the worst to wait through players like me reading through every text box that gets thrown at the players. It may seems relatively minor, but I'm borderline unable to have fun playing this game in multiplayer due to this divide.

All this said I probably haven't convinced you to buy it. I mean it's Borderlands, either it's already in your library or it's unlikely to ever get there. BOOM REVIEWED"
3662,Play with friends on this game have a good time ^^
3663,Needs more crab fighting
3664,A good classic
3665,"Pretty much the same as it has ever been. Best in the series for sure, but isn't that pretty common with the originals?"
3666,Kinda good. Just go staight for Borderlands 2.
3667,"There's some terrible screen tearing going on here.  You can't fix it without doing a little tweaking to the code.  (I followed a tutorial online, but it didn't actually fix anything.)
The game is super fun, but honestly just wait until they remaster it for steam, or atleast patch the screen tearing.  I don't know why I 100% this game, I suffered many headaches as a result.

Edit: Ok, they remastered the game and you should be able to find it in the steam store.  
Go play it!"
3668,Good Game
3669,E
3670,The start of an insane franchise.
3671,Good co-op game that's mildly amusing. Variety of the guns is cool. Get it on sale. Only downside are the fetch quests
3672,"Very intersting game and very good optimised !!!

3673,It's no Rocket League - but you can easily sink just as many hours into this
3674,It's pretty alright
3675,lots of gun
3676,Masterpiece.
3677,"Excellent (sometimes dark) humour.  You can tell by the graphics its a few years old, but for a game nearly ten years old, its held up impeccably well and is a joy to play."
3678,"Going back to this after spending many hours in Borderlands 2 leaves me feeling a bit disappointed with some of its mechanics, but that just means the devs continued to improve things after this. Great game and well worth your time. Runs smoothly under Linux (using Proton)."
3679,"This is a great game.  Lots of fun, good story line.  I can walk away from this game for a few months and come get right back into it.  Good stuff, fun guns."
3680,Quirky story and graphics combined with a fast paced first person shooter.  The only real negative is overall price of the game and dlc is out of line for a game that came out in Obama's first year as president.  It's still more fun to play than Destiny one is ;)
3681,"""Nobody shoots my buddies but me!"" - BEST GAME EVAH!"
3682,Not as good as borderlands 2 but still worth playing
3683,Horrible
3684,I'm using Ubuntu 18.04  and running Borderlands on Steam Play; it runs! Though I haven't yet checked for bugs and errors. But it kept my saves from all those years back when I used Windows 7. Ahaha how I miss my Combustion Hellfire. Thanks Valve.
3685,"This is one of the most badass games ive ever played in my entire life.
The bosses are excelent.
The gunplay wow.
The graphics never ages in my opinion.
There is much more i want to write but i dont have the patience.
I give this game a 9.5/10."
3686,"Was a blast to play although not as extreme as 2, this game will keep you going to you loook at your watch in its 3 am. THe gunplay is extremely fun, asking for you to get more and more guns. The story, is really awesome and sees you going all types of places, overall, its a really fun shooter-rpg."
3687,Is good
3688,"In some respects, way better than the second one. Characters are more fleshed out, less memes, more coherence. Still, a bit undernourished, when compared to its sequel. If you like B2 or the Pre-Sequel, but have not played this one, you should. ..AND Mordecai is SO much better here."
3689,"The first game in the infamous series that we all love.  If you're like me you played Borderlands 2 and the Pre Sequel first but this game still has the feel of its successors.  There are a few annoyances but for the most part they are minor such as having a compass map rather than a minimap, sniper rifles not always registaring headshots and a few other things.  Enough talk grab your controller, hook up with your friend(s) and go kill some Psychos"
3690,"Lock, load, and hit the road!"
3691,I guess it's really good (126.8 hours on record)
3692,"I wasn't sure about the look at first, because it's a lot like comics/graphic novel but in 3d... Turned out, that wasn't nearly as distracting as anticipated, although I found myself walking around looking at it more than in other games. Was also concerned that it would be a lighter version of Fallout, but, that's not an issue, they are definitely distinct. 

It doesn't take itself too seriously, there's lots of great humor, but, not as flippantly as the Saints' Row games. It's challenging, and the progressions pretty satisfying, too. The driving and vehicular combat is tons of fun as well. 

The intro video is awesome enough to mention in itself, sets the tone and pace beautifully. 

It's more a sandbox than open world, but, there is a good bit to do. No real choices (plot-wise, tons for character and the development thereof), but, it doesn't feel like being led through a side-scroller like some other games. 

Overall, it's highly enjoyable with a decent amount of variety in gameplay and replayability.   However. I have yet to complete it, found I had to restart to build up better for an exceptionally rough mission (then jumped to the second game and got distracted with others before I got to that point again... will come back to update this later).  It was still well worthwhile, anyway..."
3693,i love this game is one of the best that i ever seen
3694,"Repetitive mission, repetitive enemies, repetitive NPC, no storyline at all. 
Boring game, DLC nothing surprising."
3695,"Leaves me laughing everytime I jump on. 
Dont usually leave reviews.. but this game is a must have"
3696,"I don't understand all the positive reviews. This is just a bad game. Boring story and characters, horrible gameplay, mediocre graphics, cheap mission design to artificially lengthen the playtime (seriously when will I finally be done with this game? 90% of the ""gameplay"" is running from one mission to another with little overview what missions are on a path, so you end up running in zig-zag through empty landscapes filled with enemies that just respawn if you reload the map).

Everytime I play this game I feel like I am just wasting my time. It's quite the oposite of satisfying.

Note: I am playing in solo mode. I am just playing to ""prepare"" for Borderlands 2, since this is supposed to be great... just like this one (?)"
3697,yo
3698,"This game has aged surprisingly well, lacking only in visual options. The gameplay is as fast and varied as possible for something of its age, and its DLCs add additional (if somewhat uninspired) enemy types and an increased level cap.
On the multiplayer front, the only thing lacking is any form of matchmaking. 
On the whole 8.5/10"
3699,"While I am usually frustrated with games where enemies respawn despite the need to repeatedly go through the same areas, this game was thoroughly enjoyable.  Despite a slightly weak storyline and somewhat anemic ending, the humor and artistry make up for it in spades.  ~60 hours of gameplay to hit every mission in complete single-player (no co-op)."
3700,7/10
3701,"You find yourself on at a dusty bus stop set off to find loot. There are rumors of a mystical vault filled to the brim with something. 
You get to explore this vast dusty rock going to all sorts of places in search of the vault, or you can get distracted with good sidequests."
3702,"The beginning of one of my personal favorite series. While the game is rather old at this point it does still play pretty well, the story is pretty good, it does an excellent job laying out background for the next game in the series.

Definitely worth buying and playing."
3703,"never really paid much attention to this game in the past, but after my friend convinced me to get the new borderlands pre sequel i had to buy the whole boderland bundle with all the games and DLCs, and let me tell you, i am not disappointed one bit, lucky for me the bundle was on sale for 20 dollars i believe, 4 amazing games with all the DLCs, regardless of the discount, this is a great game that has aged well, the art style isnt demanding on your computer and the characters are likeable, out of all the games in the series this one is my lowest ranking one, however nothing is wrong with the game, the story the custoimization and even the gameplay are great, its just a little slower paced compared to the other ones and thats why its in the bottom, other than that this is a great game and a must if you wanna get started with the borderland series."
3704,This is a AWESOME GAME
3705,Exclusivity deals are anti-consumer.
3706,"When I first played this game back in 2012 or 2013 I did not like it at first because I didn't understand what to do and was considering returning it for another game. Fast forward to 2018 I have 169.6 hours on pc ALONE as of making this review and god knows how much I played on the ps3. Timeless graphics that don't look that bad for being released in 2009. Addictive gameplay that will make the hours fly. Replayablility. Fantastic DLC that is worth waiting for the GOTY edition to go on sale. Good story for introducing new players to the borderlands universe. Now all that being said the only complaint I have on this game is since it was released in 2009 and being developed probably on consoles first it's lacking some options in the settings that is a standard now for pc games(FOV, vsync, mouse smoothing, motion blur, etc) which has you going into the settings file and tweaking the settings there which at times could be annoying. Final verdict: I recommend this game to anyone who loves video games and investing hours into them."
3707,"To clarify, I have played through this game multiple times on PS3 when it first came out. I feel like we got spoiled with Borderlands 2, because this game does not hold up. I thought I would enjoy the game more when playing it on PC, but it felt even worse than I expected. Visually, the game looks way older than it actually is, and the lack of an FOV slider makes me feel sick. Even going into the files and manually changing it did not have the effect I was hoping for. The story is incredibly forgettable, even after playing through it 4 times. And with Borderlands 2 GOTY edition going on sale for less than $10 constantly, this game is irrelevant. 

Overall Score: 4/10

Edit: Remaster update. If it contains and FOV slider and all of the quality of life changes they mentioned, this will be a solid recommendation despite it still being overshadowed by BL2. New score is 6/10, just make sure to get the remaster!"
3708,Still a fun loot shooter - just a bit easy if you are not drunk.
3709,It's good solo. It's good with friends. It's got a LOT of content to go through and it's got a charming personality along with it.
3710,just about goood
3711,It's fun
3712,I have played this game since the day it came out and still love it to this day!!
3713,Who needs Rick and Morty when you have Brick and Mordy
3714,8/10
3715,"This game will ALWAYS find a way to make me want to play again. With friends or alone it's always incredible and so much fun, it's basically never ending.
The loot system is brilliant and always a surprise, there's always something new to find. The combat feels great and fluid. There's just so many good things about it, too many to list.
I'm sure other reviewers would have said it already but this game how ever old it is, feels timeless with the amount of fun it brings."
3716,One of the best Co-op games ever!
3717,Borderlands is a fantastic game! I love the look and feel of the game.
3718,Very Good Story Game
3719,Great co-op game.
3720,this port is fucking awful.
3721,"This is a really fun game, and great value for money.  There are four characters to play with; I have so far played more than 80 hours of this game with only one of these characters, but due to the added DLC I reckon I probably still have more than the same amount of time again left before I would need to play with one of the others to refresh the playing experience.  There is a main mission in the first game, but plenty of side missions to give you a bit of a breather when it gets too intense.  You will end up progressing a long way and then wanting to go back to previous areas because you won't have played them out.  Luckily there is a teleportation system so that you don't actually need to travel all the way in a vehicle.  It would take quite a while to find your way back to the beginning if you tried to drive it.  It is a very forgiving game, but challenging with it.    Thankfully running out of ammo is quite rare, and most new zones provide an option to buy more as well.   The chaos kind of reminds me of Serious Sam, but with more structure and narrative.  The way the story develops also reminds me a bit of the development of the x files through the series.   The huge number of weapons provides an interesting lot of variety, and different combinations of weaponry and shields make a big difference to the difficulty of defeating different creatures or enemies.  There are very few that you absolutely have to defeat in order to reach the end; but there are a great deal that you can finish off on side quests.   If you are into crazy FPS games, then this is just about everything you could want.  The only real problem for me was that the npc AI seems to be fairly primitive at times.  I didn't really notice it too much before getting into the DLC.  I don't know whether that was because the DLC has more predictable characters, or if I was just getting used to them by then.  So far I am not sure whether I would recommend the DLC, but the main game itself is a definite must have."
3722,nice game i received for free ffrom my friend
3723,"Good gateway game to FPSs, fun for any ability, great story and characters."
3724,Words are not enough to describe my love to this game. This is a must play. After a certain time you really get used to the game and you feel like you can do anything. Another great thing about this is that you can't really get bored of it. The ending wasn't the way I imagined but I didn't really care because the journey before it was awesome and worth it...
3725,"I played this after Borderlands 2, but I still found this very entertaining. Agreed that none of the characters you can play as in this are as cool as Zer0, but eh, doesn't matter. Buy along with DLCs. They are fun.
Ps. ""Remember, if you buy from anyone else, I'll have you killed."""
3726,<3
3727,"Borderlands is a timeless classic whichIi myself have put 100s of hours into ever since 2009. Borderlands is a FPSRPG with four playable characters, and a one of a kind randomly generated loot system. Each character has their own action skill, along with three unique skill trees. You can get tons of awesome guns, all with there own bonuses and attributes unique to that particular gun. The story and quests in this game are all fun in their own way, and none of it feels repetitive. This game stands out because it is a first person shooter with and amazing loot system, and up to 4 people playing co-op together, not to mention the four dlcs that have there own mini storyline (except Mad Moxxi's Underdome) and quests to go along with it. If you are a fan of open-world rpgs, and or fps games, I highly recommend giving Borderlands a try, as it is a combination between all of those, along with a amazing and fun multiplayer play."
3728,"The game is still fun but $29.99 is way too much to pay for a 9 year old game.

Do not buy this game at full price"
3729,I originally played Borderlands on my ps3 years ago and it was the first game after building my new pc (switching over from console). To say the least it stood the test of time and I have thoroughly enjoyed the nine or so hours I have put into it.
3730,It’s one of my favorite games it was a totally different experience
3731,Great beginning to an amazing game series.
3732,"If you like piles of guns, lots to do and shoot, and a robust leveling system with a natural coop multi-player aspect and aren't put off by the cel shading, it's a damn near perfect game for you. I do recommend playing the franchise in the correct order to maintain the storyline. But all the games solo are fun either way."
3733,"It's one of those games that, for it's time, it was fantastic. (At least it seems that way).
Borderlands is fun and a decent game, but its successor Borderlands 2 is a much more polished, well-oiled game that is definitely worth your time.
I still plan to finish this game, just so I can check it off my list, but all in all, it's pretty rough and I recommend skipping it. Plus the bonus you get in the sequels is not worth the purchase price of this game.

Summary:
This is a good game IF you play this first, but if you play Borderlands 2 first, don't bother. It doesn't live up to it's sequels."
3734,3/5
3735,"Fun game to wreak havoc, its sequel is even better and the MP feature is great, this one is missing SteamOS support though."
3736,Not optimised for Windows 10 at all.
3737,pew pew
3738,randomly got all dlc for free 11/10
3739,"There's always a sequel, would've played more if i thought it was fun."
3740,Been playing this game on ps3 since 2009 and bought it for pc in 2017 and this game is still one of the best games I've played even comparing it to fortnite or csgo. Keep it up Gearbox!
3741,Great game to play solo or 4 player co-op!!! this game is an utter masterpiece with unlimited replayablility.... Old but still good highly recommended XXD
3742,Pretty gamer 10/10
3743,claptrap isnt annoying he is adorable .fight me.
3744,"Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until bandits wreck your a[b][/b]ss for good"
3745,"I've played borderlands 2 before this one, It wasn't hard to catch on on the story line but I felt like all the huge bars of hp and how much enemies i fight at once + how much maps there are overwhelming and needed to get used to. Borderlands 1 has this cozy feel of starting in a small map attacking small pups and bandits, slowly becoming more. And that you can see the first map in the second game.

If you want to play the Borderlands series it doesn't matter that much which one you choose to play first but it's recommended to play this one first for that cozy slowly becoming bigger feeling :D"
3746,"An absolute classic, but shows its age. Can be a good time with friends running through the unique setting and story. Dogshit graphics though.

5/10 Pretty fun co-op game"
3747,"Loved the game, some weird keybinds. A little tough when you first start"
3748,"About a minute and a half of unskippable bullshit every time you launch the game, ARE YOU HAVING FUN YET, no? Just wait a minute and a half then.... EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

Annoying save points where it's not obvious if you saved or not, I see the save icon flash and believe that its saved but it actually didn't and I lost a bunch of levels. Fuck off. 

This game still looks great for its age though. Graphics are very good even today. Theres a lot of good stuff here, but some *infuriating* choices make it.. well... infuriating."
3749,...
3750,"I prefer Borderlands 2 but this game is actually really good too.

The plot is kinda simple with no subplots (none that I know of, after playing the game after 2 playthroughs) but don't let this reason sway you away from this game. I recommend it 9/10"
3751,"This game sends me back on a nostalgia trip to my xbox 360 days. It has a different feel than the sequels, but is well worth playing and has tons of fun gameplay. It's where the series began and is absolutely worth your time."
3752,"I don't typically play first person shooters unless it's with friends because I find them repetitive.
I don't typically play role playing games because I dislike the lack of purpose and wandering around of the overwhelming amount of missions.

Somehow, this game is both of the above things, including the negative bits that I mentioned, but still fantastic and something that I enjoyed playing to completion. And I hear that #2 is even better.

So all in all, not my favourite game because it is not my niche but it was so excellently made that I enjoyed it playing it to completion (no Playthrough 2 yet though)."
3753,"Great game, and it's aged good so far."
3754,"This game hits all the strong notes one would look for in a game. Engaging, sort-of well-written story, engaging and hilarious characters, fun, diverse gameplay, and guns galore. You're always on the look-out for that next great item. Having played this one in it's entirety on PS3 and now PC, it is easily my favorite of the series. I feel like Gearbox really hit their stride with the first game. It's just too funny. Simply put; if you want something that doesn't take too much thought or energy, and is a thouroughly enjoyful experience, this is your game. Especially if you want to play with your buddies.

Let the good times, and the heads, roll"
3755,"Fun game at first, love the art style reminiscent of TF2 but overall toward the end you just finding yourself wishing it would already. Get it for $5 or dont bother imo, no replay value."
3756,"The Good:

What makes BL1 worth buying over its sequels? The gunplay.

For starters, guns have punchier, louder, more satisfying sound effects. Bullets also travel faster than you can percieve while still not being pure hitscan, making them behave very realistically. The guns themselves look much cooler, to boot.

Almost all guns of all parts are useful, something the sequels cannot boast at all. For example, in the sequels, assault rifles rarely have enough damage and accuracy to make them worth keeping over the raw DPS of SMG's. Here, if an AR doesn't have good accuracy, it'll have almost sniper rifle level damage and a blistering fire rate, making them nuclear weaponry and allowing the weaker, more plentiful SMG's to take over the role as your standard gun, as it logically should be. A big mean AR should be more powerful than a dinky little SMG, while the opposite is true in both sequels.

All gun manufacturers are useful. For example, in the sequels, Dahl AR's are crap: Low damage, average accuracy and below average magazine size for the questionable bonus of less recoil and a burst fire that's only active while zoomed, becoming almost a straight downgrade to all other AR's when unzoomed. Here, Dahl guns have the burst feature active at all times and have fantastic accuracy to make up for their low per-shot damage, just like the tried and true Battle Rifle from Halo, making them ideal for headshots at any range.

As for something unrelated to guns, BL1 allows you to mix and match your chosen character's colors completely as you see fit. No more settling for something that looks ""good enough"", letting another color you like go unused because it's stapled to an overall uglier palette set. In the sequels, if I wanted blond hair and purple leggings on my Gaige, I'd have to also wear an ugly green vest. If I wanted her to wear a dark black color, I'd have to deal with the entire palette being black from head to toe, making her outfit look boringly undetailed. Here, you can set all the colors exactly how you want them to be.


The Bad:

The game has a very annoying habit of the environment blocking shots that should have passed through. I'd be pointing a sniper rifle 3 feet from the back of a stationary enemy's head and it would still miss because the corner they were leaning on had a wider hitbox than its model shows, or because a 2 foot wide gap in a parked car or wall wasn't actually a gap at all. Moving to a different place fixes the problem, while staying causes miss after miss, which is very irritating if you don't realize right away what's actually happening and keep blaming your gun or your aim.

There's a lot of interface bug-bears to be found. Wearing a level raising Class Mod won't display any increased level, leaving you scratching your head over if it's working or not. Shields won't display their recharge delay, so you have to manually count the seconds yourself. The map won't show all of your current mission's objectives, it'll show them to you in a seemingly random order one by one as they're collected, though you can at least collect them ""out of order"" if you find them on your own. That leads to a lot of wasted time, going back and forth from one end of the map to the other when you could have gotten them in a single, convenient 'round trip.

The shops seem to have very sporadic leveling for their gear, bouncing between like, 6 levels. For this reason, shopping seems to have no rhyme or reason to what sort of gear you'll find, which encourages you to check frequently.


The Ugly:

The rumors are true, the story is a bland, forgettable sandwich of text dumps and busy work. VERY few characters get to do or say anything that makes them stand out. The only person who gets any character growth is Tannis, which was really nice at least. You'll hear how she gradually starts going from a normal scientist with a normal speaking voice, to the snobby theatrics and weird quirks we see in the sequels. Most quest givers don't get a unique model, or even a unique hat to set them apart from any other generic NPC.

The sequels pick up the slack, but after playing them first, I was excited to see these characters when they were first introduced. It was disappointing to see that they barely do or say anything.
(*Spoilers*) 
For example, TK Baha - the unwaveringly upbeat blind crippled widower zombie we love in the sequels - gets maybe 5 lines of dialogue that aren't generic greetings and gets axed off with no explaination, not even a token quest to find his killer. Scooter just calls him a jerk for dying without paying back money he was owed.

Almost all the plot and dialogue is given to you in giant paragraphs of text, most of which aren't even interesting enough to read anyway. It gets really boring if you aren't used to reading text dumps, especially after the fun voice acting and more entertaining writing in the sequels.


Final verdict: 5/10

Borderlands 1: Better gunplay for worse characterization and a less engaging story. If I could somehow have these guns ported into the sequels, I'd do it in a heartbeat. Otherwise, it's really not worth the purchase, even as a fan of the series. So little stuff happens that even most of what little plot exists, doesn't carry over to the rest of the series.

Buy it only if you're a HARD CORE fan of Borderlands, and just want to see more of Pandora. You could find more engaging shooter games than Borderlands 1."
3757,The start of something awesome...
3758,oki game
3759,"Well, this game is boring and repetitive.

I'll just keep playing it, because I bought the GoTY edition, not knowing how boring it is."
3760,"This is the best cuckold simulator out there.
It almost makes me want to renounce the 14 words after playing it.
WTF I LOVE INTERRACIAL CUCKOLDRY NOW!"
3761,"Pew pew pew, It's gun time!!!

Okay quotes aside...I played this game exactly 9 years after the release date and I STILL ENJOY IT! I have no clue why some people are so against it, I guess...if you played the second first and then want to go back to this (for the first time) maybe it's lacking something (not sure what since I still haven't played the second ^^) BUT as a gamer who loves any good game no matter the graphics and how old they are...I honestly LOVED it. It's fun, clever and crazy! I loved the DLCs a lot and what else to say...oh right....ADD IT TO YOUR GAME LIBRARY! NOW! :P"
3762,One of my all time favorite FPS games with some RPG feelings mixed in. The crazy amount of different weapons and equipment you can loot from enemies and chests is awesome.
3763,"Still great game, i love it,  more climatic then BL2 in my opinion."
3764,get this game if you are a true man
3765,"What can I say, one of the best games ever! Non stop fun and loot, what more do you need? Visually on PC - just blows you away after many years of playing it on consoles. Weapons?

3772,"My Personal Review: Borderlands 1 (2009)

My Personal Rating: 5.5/10

Conclusion:

I guess this game is just not for me. This game is intended to be for just fun of shooting bandits with your friends. The whole playthrough felt like a Massive Boring Grind.. Do this. Do that. Do those.. Story is not even worth talking about. Also that ending just is really disappointing after all of those miserable grind that i did, that's what i got? I'm not entirely saying that this is the worse game i have ever played but if you are planning to buy this game for it's story and hate the feel of doing endless grind then forget about it. Do not buy this. But if you are looking for something fun to play with your friend or just alone by yourself mindlessly shooting bandits. Then perhaps it does it's job well on that. This game is just not for me.

3773,"I had a lot of fun playing this game. The mystery, the action, the story, the comedy, I liked it all."
3774,Obviously the base for the best FPS(BL2) so far.
3775,"it's a fine game, but you might get bored playing alone.
Wait for a sale if you want to try. Not worth your time now that there's an amazing sequel."
3776,Yeah thx good
3777,"A little rough around the edges, but still good-ol' psycho-ass-kicking, explosion-making, gun-shooting fun. I would recommend starting with Borderlands 2, but the original is a good game all its own."
3778,This game is great. Many people can’t play it because they have already played borderlands 2. This game is a bit hard to play after having played bl2. If you can play this a really encourage you to.
3779,"[h1] Final Verdict: Must buy. Game that brought new life into FPS, now a Classic. One of the best of all time. [/h1]

So not only do i have 41 hours on Steam for this game. I also have just as many on Xbox. This is a classic. If you've never played it, then you have to if you love gaming. Brought new life into the FPS genre. The amazing thing is that at 40 hours, I am nowhere close to experiencing everything the game has to offer. You almost need to be unemployed to enjoy all it has to offer.

Would think about early retirement to try new class :D"
3780,"its borderlands, but like, the yucky one"
3781,anti customer company
3782,Very good game. Played this game before Borderlands 2 was released on the 360. Zombie and Secret Armory DLC are amazing addons and are definitely worth (you pretty much need Secret Armory to have the real Borderlands 1 experience). I would say this game is not as good as Borderlands 2 and all of its DLC. But Secret Armory is the BEST Borderlands DLC. Some missions can feel slow paced as some area you travel don’t have vechicle access but are very large.
3783,"Holy god worst game ever. 
You do all this missions to get to the vault just TO NOT OPEN IT?
And then you give the key to Tannis for JACKSHIT MONEY?

Stopped right there."
3784,Its very good
3785,Perfect game.
3786,good
3787,"This is a classic. Sure the second in the series took everything awesome from Borderlands 1 and ran that play again for the 2nd; but there is nothing like coming home for the original. The networking from Game Spy was a big pain in my butt, however, in recent years its all about Steam. Yes!! Great game- you are sure to love it."
3788,"[h1]Dig Through a Garbage World to Find the Gems.[/h1]

I once referred the internet to a world like Borderlands. You have to dig through a garbage world to find the gems. I played Siren, I didn’t really look up anything prior to going in. I played in a group of three through the whole main campaign. I also used a controller.

[list]
[*]I didn’t feel strong till almost the end of the game and then the super bullet sponge enemies came.
[*]There was a good portion where missions felt like we were just running back and forth mindlessly.
[*]There was lots of guns but I gave up on trying to find better ones at some point. More searching just led to more things to sell. I ended the game with more money than I could ever use.
[*]I’m tired of getting stuck on debris on the ground in games. 
[*]The story seemed liked it was mostly given through small blurbs of information.
[/list]

Story and controls are big things when I’m playing a game because I’m there for the story and I don’t want to fight the game to do things it wants me to do. The controls in Borderlands were fine. I didn’t feel like I was fighting them or they were holding me back. Now the story on the other hand did something that annoys me. [spoiler]The story is about trying to figure something out with everything leading to you trying to do that and then you don’t get that closure.[/spoiler]

While the credits rolled we talked about what we didn’t like about the game. Some of those notes are above. After talking about what we disliked I asked, ""What were some things that we liked?"" We were hard pressed to come up with some things.

If you are going to play through this game, only play it with friends.

3789,"not very interesting. you just go around, shoot things, loot things, repeat. at least the shooting part is pretty neat

3/5"
3790,"borderlands? more like blands. This game's missions are pretty repetitive even some story missions. Most story missions require you to click something then run to the opposite side of the map to click another thing. I enjoyed the bosses and the weapon varients were really cool. The gunplay was very enjoyable except when I played co-op it became very tedious. The enemies became super buff when playing with my friend, so when we were trying to get to the mission objective and were met with enemies 4 levels higher then us, it really ruined the gameplay. 7/10"
3791,Welp. That's 16 hours of my life i'll never get back.
3792,This gud fuckin game
3793,"great game, loads of hours of fun."
3794,I originally played this on my PS3 back in 2009 when it first came out and I had a lot of fun with it back then. I picked this up not to long ago in a bundle from Humble Bundle and really glad I did. Most of my time has been playing solo as I'm not a co-op person but after playing recently with a friend I wish I started playing co-op a lot sooner. Here it is 9 years later and I'm still enjoying the game. This is a very easy recommend.
3795,Boring! Has Gearbox ever done anything better than Half-Life: Opposing Force?
3796,"I just lost my person. I was level 49 and now if I want to continue playing I have to make a new person and start from scrach. I'm not doing that so I guess I'm done playing. 
Was fun while it lasted.
Pissed as hell, for fucking sure."

It starts to get more fun with the customizations, mods, and plot at level 20. If you don't believe me, give it a try and you'll see what I mean. A great game nonetheless and the multiplayer is very much alive. 8/10."

Haven't had a chance to play MP (Got no friends :( ) but I bet it is just as fun as single player. 

A solid 9/10  
"
3809,"The game that started one of the best game franchises to date...

Borderlands 1, like Borderlands 2 is an absolute masterpiece. It's worth it for full price, and I recommend buying all DLC.

My ONLY pet peeve is the stability concept. In borderlands 2, sniper rifles work like how they should: If your crosshair is on the head and you fire, it's a critical hit. However, in Borderlands 1, there is another factor that plays into it that is luck-based. (Although you can decrease the luck involved by using sniper rifles and getting your prof. levels up!

But again, since this pet peeve can be circumvented, it's no real issue. Get the game. AND bl2. Seriously."

The first borderlands game is pretty fun on its own and can be played for a long time if you and a friend are new to the game, I didn't have as much fn as i did on the second or pre sequal but that was because I played a butload on the xbox. so I reccomend this game even if you have played this in the past it still can be fun to set a challenge for your self like pistols only (it alot more fun then it sounds) 7/10"
3815,"In 2018 it's going to be hard to get into BL1. The pacing is all over the place, game starts off really slow, more tedious walking from A to B than actual shooting and looting, then it kicks into gear after the first boss, action starts picking up, you get a car which helps tremendously, after the first settlement you get access to fast travel which also speeds up the gameplay. I thought I wouldn't bear the game initally, but stuck with it and now I can't stop playing it. Shooting also starts of a bit clunky (at low levels you and your weapons are completely bad at aiming and dealing damage even at cockroaches), but becomes the most fun aspect of the game towards the 20-25 level mark.
Loot is sort of imbalanced, you'll never ever need to even pick up a repeater, maybe it's different depending on the classes, but I found myself using nothing but assault and sniper rifles and occasionally an SMG throughout the entire game as a soldier, and I spent all game long with a shotgun and a rocket launcher gathering dust in my inventory.
Enemies are fresh and keep you on your toes with every level-up, but there are times where you have to backtrack and have to face the same underleveld enemies over and over until you get bored again.
You need to give it time, but it's worth it. Between the extremely fun bits at rare occasions you have to suffer throught repetitive gameplay and needless backtracking, but at the end you won't regret giving it a try."
3816,Classic in my eyes. 10/10
3817,"VERY MEATY, I LIKE IT"
3818,many of hours spent on console and super excited to replay on pc. will always recommend the borderlands games (except Pre-sequal)!
3819,"TOO MUCH LOOT AND YOU DONT WANT TO THROW OR SELL ANYTHING. HOARDERS PARADISE. NOT FUN. BORING. TEDIOUS. REPETATIVE. I CANT BELIEVE THERE IS A SEQUEL. HARD PASS, GUYS."
3820,"A really nice coop shooter with nice stylistical decisions. Gets a bit repeatative at a point, but still really good."
3821,"Dont buy it, on modern pcs u dont have sound, the game is not saving settings etc. Ull only get frustrated and there is no way to fix it."
3822,Love this game. Playing Brick really lets me unleash my inner beserker.
3823,"Other than the very outdated driving mechanics and the inanimate non-enemy NPCs, with the help of cel shading it still holds up really well despite its age. Once you find your first good loot the game really starts to take off, and even with going out of my way to complete every mission I never felt bored or like anything was repetitve...until the last mission, and then the ending is pretty lame. Still insanely fun and definitely worth playing in 2018 though. Borderlands 2 took the formula of the original and improved it in nearly every way, so if you can only play one you should probably play the second, but that in no way shape or form means this is a bad or average game. It's still one of the best FPS looter shooters ever made and a must if you're a fan of the series.

The only thing I found really annoying was that I couldn't scroll/read the mission descriptions on the bounty boards when I was accepting them, I didn't find out until near end-game that scrolling through them works just fine in the mission log...."

3825,"Entertaining and engaging cooperative RPG with FPS mechanics and enough loot and gear to keep everyone happy. Immersive setting, plot, and characters, and enjoyable to people of all ages (parental discretion advised, there are definitely adult themes, but 8 year olds enjoy it anyway!) Great, relaxing game for those of us bad at FPS (myself) and those impatient with most RPGs (my group); one of those ""compromise"" games that everyone walks away from happy."
3826,Good.
3827,"just trayna complete to continue to bo2
"
3828,"Still a great game in 2018, especially if you get the GOTY for $7.50. Tons of content."
3829,"I played Borderlands 2 and The Pre Sequel before this but I decided to give this a go since it was on sale. I actually believe this one is better than the Pre Sequel in a lot of ways. It's basically just a barebones Borderlands experience without all the obnoxious satire. Borderlands 2 had its comical moments, but the Pre Sequel was too much for me. Maybe for the next iteration they'll borrow from this game's simplicity.

Anyways, If you like Borderlands' gameplay and atmosphere (nice music too) but don't care as much for the humor and character development, I'd say give this a go. Shoot and loot. Pretty simple and I like simple."
3830,"A classic!

While I did enjoy playing it solo, what makes this game amazing isgroup Co-Op with your friends. I played it through three separate times, with three separate groups.

A few helpful notes:
* Bare with the first 1/4 of the playtime being confined within the same area, it really opens up into intersting terrain after that.
* The playtime is much shorter than Borderlands 2, but sometimes that is nice, espeically when playing Co-Op with friends, where you aren't sure how much time they'll have to play.
* If you play Co-Op, you'll want to keep levelled the same as other people in the group, which means making a specific character for each group, and having someone who missed a session level up solo to catch-up with the group."
3831,"Borderlands retains the best elements of Fallout 3, leveling, skills, open RPG environment, and the first person shooter behavior and ridiculous weapons variety of Modern Warfare, all wrapped up in an orignal and creative style. The opportunities for developing a unique character based on the choices you make in the game are nearly infinite. I love this game, a must buy masterpiece of action, over-the-top violence, and original adult humor. It is one of the OG coop games for multiplayer gun-looting on Xbox 360. (just good old murder, revenge, offensive language, alcohol consumption, blood, and sexual humor.)

8.5/10"
3832,"Still cool game but after few weeks is it bit boring..
Good game for people who doesn't have any friends 

+ Good sounds
+ Good story
+ Good comic graphic (for the game release - 2009)

BUT:
You can easily skip missions and beat the boss lul 

money is it worth ^^"
3833,"I'm so glad that 2K games has partnered with steam and released their awesome lineup, this is just like the console version which means there's action packed gameplay and plenty of quirky profanity that will entertain you for hours at a time

It also has some of the best dlcs/expansions ever so extra shout out for that"
3834,yes
3835,its ok
3836,The others in this franchise are available on Linux.. I truly wish the first one was as well.. Original Borderlands is one of my favorite.
3837,"Great example of a good game you don't need the best of the best weapons to beat it, but putting in the grind to get good weapons and a decen build for your character and you will obliterate anything that comes in your path. This game also puts in way more than enough juice so you don't feel like your grinding out to get to the next level. The game is also visually unique the way the outlines of objects are exagerated and are yet realistic. The mechanics are pretty good the only bad thing I experienced was the FOV it was so low compared to Borderlands 2 yet with a simple google search there is an easy fix anyone could do. In conclusion this is a very good game especially for being released in late 2009, and if you don't own it and are considering it, DO IT! it is an extremely fun game by yourself or with friends"
3838,"This game is 9 years old and it is still really good. Sometimes it felt like Fallout 4's grandfather which is far from a bad thing.
In 30+ hours of playing, it crashed three times, but I didn't lose any progress. Major pain in the a$$ is the lack of minimap. As I already mentioned this is an old game so don't expect online players. But you can host a game and play with some friends. My recommendation is to get a Four Pack at a discount price and enjoy."

3844,Never gets old.
3845,"A classic, and still looking good in 2018. Shooter with RPG elements and a linear story which still leaves some room to maneuver and explore. Well worth whatever one is paying these days which should not be that much."
3846,"Never play this after Borderlands 2 or later ones cuz then this game becomes very SLOOOOOOOW, boring and bad"
3847,more like BORING lands 1
3848,"People might only remember this as the game before Handsome Jack. And just like sucky pretzels, we have to get sucky prequels..... no wait, this game didn't suck at all, nor was it a prequel. It is a badass stand alone game in its own right. Yeah Borderlands 2 may have improved on just about everything, but people don't hate on Half-Life 2 just because Half-Life 3 was so much better... oh wait. Ouch.

Damn it. Have you ever made a joke so bad it hurt your own soul?  Well, i just did that. And the only possible cure is the lovable mayhem that is this game."
3849,"The game is worth buying on sale for sure, however i didn't enjoy the lack of color it made it less enjoyable as if i was seeing the same scenery over and over, i also found that the difficulty changed throughout the game drastically. It went from really easy to difficult moments back to really easy etc. I also would have liked it better if the story was given by voice actors instead of reading most of the story line, i personally find it makes the game feel smaller, and more alone. There are some bugs.. but you can kill them pretty easy."
3850,"run so poorly, this game bad port"
3851,good game
3852,"After being spoiled by BL2, it can be a little hard to come back to the original. It is worth playing through, regardless. For it's time, BL was such an original idea. Playing through it the first time was an amazing experience, and it gets even better when you can get a party going. The games are also worth playing in order, as the characters have actual development, even in the first game. The characters and their skills are still pretty unique and playing through the game with a different character can really change your playstyle. My biggest gripe would be the guns, which again is something taken care of by later titles. Most Legendary weapons will just be some extra stats over a unique effect. While they are more powerful, it is really easy to replace because they did not do anything special. Stick around for the missions, the humor and the story, you will still have a great time."
3853,Very unfriendly game for 2018
3854,This Game is so much fun. get it while the sale is on
3855,"My only gripe about the game is that it doesnt have a way through the game to adjust the FOV. The default is awful for PC play. From your couch, its passable, but when youre less than three feet from your monitor it's really bad. Ultrawide is available but you lose a lot in vertical space. ANYWAYS, this is still a good looter shooter almost 10 years latter and worth your money for like 5 bucks. It's Borderlands, you know what you're getting"
3856,REALLY GOOD!!
3857,Wet me!
3858,"While I think this is an awesome game, the entire reason I bought this game on PC is because I've gotten rid of my console systems and I wanted to play Borderlands co-op with my girlfriend. Unfortunately, the PC version of this game conveniently dosen't support split-screen mode..... I don't understand why on earth they would get rid of this part of the game as it is by far the best, and probably only, reason to play this game. And yes, I realize that co-op is still supported via lan or online play but I don't want to play with just anyone; I want to play with the person sitting on the couch next to me and I think that it's bullshit that she would need to have her own computer, monitor, steam account and then purchase the game just for us to be able to sit next to one another and play. 
I don't plan on refunding the game because I do like it and I may eventually play through single player again but I feel extremely ripped off since I can't play this the way that I had planned. I honestly can't believe that the consoles beat out PC in this respect, I'm losing faith in the PC masterrace. 

tl;dr - great game but split-screen co-op not included, Fuck PC....."
3859,Feels like an alpha to Borderlands 2 but still a solid game. The story is trash but fun gamepaly. If you get this get it with the DLCS as the real story comes from them.

3862,Awesome game with a lot of work put into. Sadly the games started getting worse with borderlands II and only recommend getting this game out of the whole series.
3863,awsome game love it

3865,"What a great game! Still worth playing after all that time.
Can't go wrong with this one."
3866,why does carpet
3867,"As a singleplayer game it's sorta just alright overall. Didn't play multiplayer or DLC.

One play through the main quest and a large number of side missions.

Pros
- Distinct cell-shaded visual style that still looks great nearly a decade after its release
- Cool Mad Max meets Fallout setting post apocalyptic looking setting
- entertaining dark humor throughout
- bat shit crazy amount of guns and the need to always chase more and more guns with more crazy abilities is about the only thing that kept my interest.

Cons
- A.I. is probably one of the most simplistic I've ever encoutered in a game combined with it using the stat based weapons means they're pretty terrible. This factors into the boss fights as well. On the main quest the 3rd last boss of the game the story made a massive deal about me facing a massive ""challenge"" well the boss was massive but it litterally did nothing than stand and stare at me while i shot it in the face with a shotgun. 
- The game is very very very easy. Combination of high level character abilities with an always improving arsenal of weapons, Terrible AI 
- Game is padded with backtracking and simplisic ""go here kill thing"" or ""go here and press button"" or ""go here and kill thing and press button"" side missions

3868,"[h1] Borderlands [/h1]

Certainly in my top most favorite games to play!
Solo or Coop, I'll always find this game entertaining.
The RNG farming, the funny offensive violence, just entertaining.   ^^

Bad me, i started with Borderlands 2 first, and after few hundred hours i thought oh yeah, Borderlands 1 also exists.
After playing Borderlands 1, i understood a lot more of the jokes in Borderlands 2.
So i do recommend playing 1 before 2 if it's not to late like with me.   xD
Some still start with 2 but to each his own.   :]

The Borderlands series are still very populair and they are Gearbox his breadmakers for sure.
Ofcourse they got other things, im not saying they are bad no worries, but Borderlands his community is still very much active and that says a lot!

The whole MMOFPS idea, the graphics and design are awesome!
Took me a while to get used to though (even after playing Borderlands 2), but very much worth to play!"
3869,"When Borderlands first came out, it was fantastic. 
A new and fresh approach to an oversaturated genre of ""serious"" first person shooters. 
The first and most obvious refreshment came from the comic art style, followed by the comedic approach to story telling. 
However, the first didn't do much in the way of development for the playable characters at least not until the later games. 
DLC is also equally dope. 
Would definitely recommend."
3870,The Gold Standard for co-op shooters besides....Borderlands 2.
3871,"I'm ocd, so I had to play the first one before I played the second one. I do not regret it. The story is pretty cool, the characters are dope and the weapons you can use are pretty awesome. Playing this before Borderlands 2 allowed me to understand the story better and thus appreciate the second game more. Overall great buy if there is a sale."
3872,"Clunky, Blind, Fetch-Quest Precursor to the follow-up gem: Borderlands 2.

tl/dr: Skip Borderlands and buy Borderlands 2 GOTY. Source: thousands of hours playing the follow-up, hundreds in BL1. 

I don't like to give poor reviews, especially since I love Borderlands 2. Played this original back when it came out, liked it, jumped on the follow up, Borderlands 2. Close to 4000 hours later, decided to give the original another play. Shouldn't have as I'd become spoiled. Just finished the first play through. About half way through it became a slog. Pushed onwards to finish it, which I just did. No follow-on playthroughs for me. Back to the gem that is 2012's BL2.

To me, there's only one reason to play this game. You'd like to try the series and really feel strongly about either doing them in sequence, for the story and lore.

I'd say that if you aren't hardcore story- and lore-driven there's no need for this game. BL2 is the one to start with. There's enough in the story there to keep most entertained, you won't really miss not knowing what came before.

Even if you haven't played Borderlands 2, you've likely played a game or two of a more modern FPS or RPG or loot-driven title to know what fluid and engrossing game play is like. Borderlands is not this, even though it may have felt that way nine years ago. Even a few years later, technology, hardware, game/programming engines, and just plain developer experience improved to the point where the successor felt vastly superior....and [i]still[/i] holds up in 2018.

Borderlands was a great, ground-breaking game in 2009, deserving of the following it generated. I was among the faithful.

Thankfully Gearbox learned and saw room for improvement across many facets of the game, publishing Borderlands 2 three years later, in 2012. Improve it did. Greatly. Room for improvement with Borderlands 2? Of course, there always is. But not nearly to the same extent.

Coming back to this game wasn't entirely a chore. I loved seeing the game's original artwork again, the familiarity of some of the locations, and being able to play different characters and skills. Guns, too, in some cases, were a pleasure to come back too, especially explosive snipers and SMGs, missing in the BL2 universe. Love playing with the few e-tech weapons I came across, they are truly fun to play with here. That 10100 cannon!

But with the benefit of both the passage of time and having enjoyed the follow up as much as I have and continue to do, there are a whole list of things that I disliked, [b]many due to the earlier time it was designed and the dev's relative inexperience.[/b] 

[b]Can't Move in FFYL[/b]. Dying? Can't move. 'nuff said.

[b]Fetch Quests Vibe.[/b] Many new players to BL2 find the story boring to the point of wanting to bypass it entirely via power leveling, a practice I'm completely against. I've never understood this desire, no matter how many times I've replayed the story. Borderlands, in contrast, actually led me to briefly reconsider my opposition. This game really feels like fetch-quest central, to the point where about halfway through I stopped accepting side missions and concentrated on the story quests only. I wanted to (yikes!) get to the ""end""quickly. Gulp!

What contributes to this? A things in particular. Poor map management, lack of BL2's HUD-based minimap, slow toon running pace (and awkward running animation), and poor placement of the game's catch-a-ride stations. These latter spots are where the player can call up a car to drive around the map instead of far more slowly on foot.  

[b]Poor Map Management[/b]. The maps themselves are servicable, but can often be confusing. I use an XBox 1 controller. The main issue is that I find myself constantly wanting to see where I was in a map to get my bearings. Without accessing a menu, the HUD only includes a horizontal compass along the bottom with a diamond representing your waypoint. Since a straight line, let alone without elevation change, is rarely the route to it, it becomes a necessity to constantly bring up the map.

Perhaps because of my controller use, short of button rebinding (something I admittedly didn't try), zooming and panning in the map must be done with mouse and keyboard. This in itself is disruptive. In addition, many of the maps are long and the zoom is capped. This means that it is often impossible to see the other end of the map (sometimes with your marked destination) until you progress, say, 1/3 to half of the way, through the map. 

[b]Lack of HUD-Based Minimap[/b]. Gearbox bringing this to Borderlands 2 brought a HUGE improvement to game play fluidity. Being able to visually reference where you are at all times in a small yet detailed HUD-based minimap is wonderful. Not only this, but you can see where baddies are in relation to your location and the way you are facing. Borderlands definitely misses this, in a big way.

[b]Baddie Location Marking[/b]. Baddie location is only marked in the game's HUD via red dots on the horizontal compass bar - which is lacklustre at best in the job it is trying to do. Quite often I found myself spinning around looking for who was attacking me. Upon taking damage, the HUD does ""light up"" in a manner that is supposed to indicate from where the attack is coming from, but I found it ineffective more than anything.

[b]Slow Toon Running Speed and Clunky Animation[/b]. There may actually be little to no difference in the relative base running speed of a toon in both games, but it sure felt slow here. Especially since it was often where vast swaths of the map needed to be covered to get to the next destination and the closest catch-a-ride station nowhere near. This accentuated the game's fetch quest feeling. The running animation, while purely esthetic, simply became annoying very quickly.

[b]Catch-A-Ride Placement[/b]. As mentioned above, during quite a few missions you'd need to traverse large areas of a map (or maps), only to need to return by a similar route to turn that mission in. While these stations are often located near map transitions, if you find yourself away from these far-flung spots or simply in the middle of the map, there weren't enough of these stations to minimize the walking/running. 

[b]Lack of Clear Story- and Side-Mission Differentiation[/b] This is an annoyance, rather than impediment to play. Mission cards don't clearly indicate whether they be part of the story or a side mission. I found myself accepting side quests at the start of the game, doing them, then wanting to get back to the story after being bored with needing to bounce all over the map just to finish each. Cycling through my mission list to find it was made harder by unclear demarkation. Borderlands 2 improved on this by indicating ""story mission"" or ""side mission"" in the mission's card. Small detail, but certainly welcome.

Borderlands was a real chore for me to finish after coming back to it from Borderlands 2. To the point where Claptrap's seemingly continuous and repetitive dialogue in spots really irked me (and I honestly like the little guy):

""Hello, there are new missions available at the New Haven bounty board.""
""Scooter asked me to tell you about a little something something he wants done. You should ask him about it""

Ugh.

Tactics-wise, the game's end boss is unimaginative, underwhelming, and simply a bullet sponge. To me it was a fitting end to my return to the original.

No desire for play through 2, let alone 3, nor to replay any DLC. 

Until the next installment in this series becomes a reality, I'm more than happy to continue to add to my hours in Borderlands 2. Not bored there. Should the anticipation lead to disappointment for whatever reason (addition of microtransactions, changes to solid and proven gameplay mechanics, broken toons/glitching/cheats, or the injection of further social engineering cues, etc.),  Borderlands 2 still exists....thankfully.

I'd recommend going for the prime rib: Borderlands 2."
3873,"i havent gotten the four pack 
"
3874,A rare TRUE RPG shooter
3875,Great game! Fuck T-Bone Junction
3876,"What a fantastic game!  Great game play, large selection of weaponry, lots and lots of quests...I was very pleased.  I found this to be a high-quality FPS for a reasonable price.   I've logged over 81 hours at writing of this review and, so far, have only played through as one of the selectable characters.   Sometimes, I did find the AI a tad predictable.  Still, I found this game to be challenging.  I suspect this will also have some replay value in the future.  Definitely deserves a thumbs up."
3877,"[h1] Summary [/h1]
Borderlands is an open-world role-playing game of first-person shooter that was developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games in 2009.
Borderlands allows the player to control one of the four ""Vault Hunters"" on the planet Pandora, completing main missions and optional side quests. The vault hunter searches for a rumored ""vault"", which is said to contain advanced alien technology.
The game features online cooperative gameplay, randomly generated loot such as shields and guns, as well as the ability to upgrade character skills.

[h1] Rating [/h1]
[b] 1) Graphics (✔) [/b] 
Borderlands had very unique graphics when released. Only few other games like XIII has similar comics-like visualization. Using this kind of graphics is quite smart considering it would lose almost nothing on it's quality over span of years (except for high definition etc).
User Interface is clean, clear and minimal. 
Variety of NPC models is decent. There are three categories: Humans, Creatures and Guardians. Human NPCs are mostly bandits and Crimson Lance forces. As for creatures there are Skags, Spiderants, Rakks, Scythids and Crawlers. Guardians have two different models. Each model use different color schemes.

[b] 2) Optimization (✔) [/b]
Game runs very smoothly even on older systems.

[b] 3) RPG elements (-) [/b]
RPG elements consists of leveling your character and for every level (starting at level 5), your character earns 1 skill point, which you can spend on different skills clustered in skill trees. Do not expect dialogues or interaction with your environment. There is none. It's simply FPS with RPG elements.

[b] 4) Combat (✔) [/b]
Combat in this game is fantastic. It's dynamic and fast paced. AI is not very smart but it's compensated with amount of enemies. Quantity over quality in this case. But for some reason, it really fits the setting. For me it was enjoyable experience.
Game uses ""Procedural Content Creation System"" which means that weapons are randomly generated with different alterations of firepower, rate of fire, accuracy and other things like elemental damage or regenerative ammo. Items use color-coded scale to indicate it's rarity. It was estimated that the random system could generate over 17 million variations of weapons.

[b] 5) Quests (-) [/b]
Borderlands offer huge amount of quests in form of main story line and plenty of side quests. Main story is quite alright, but side quest could become monotonous very fast.

[b] 6) Multiplayer (✔) [/b]
Game offers classic multiplayer mode for 4 players but also co-op campaign. Single player mode is fine. But co-op is where true fun begins. I've played whole game in co-op mode and it took me almost 100 hours to complete everything there is in this game. And I've enjoyed every single hour of it.

[h1] Verdict [/h1]
You won't make a mistake if you buy this game. It's great. It's fun. And it's great and fun while playing with friends. I recommend buying Game of the Year edition since it includes 4 DLCs. And during sales (which are few times per year) you can get this game quite cheap."
3878,still cool
3879,"Best game ever

1. Runs in a potato pc
2. Open World
3. A lot of weapon and upgrades
4. Dlc makes the game even better
5. Love it"
3880,"It's Borderlands, so it's amazing."
3881,guns lots and lots of guns in fact its all about guns and bosses
3882,"Borderlands is a wonderful game where the content is very entertaining and can extend to 100+ hours. Definitely worth every penny of its purchase price. However, I have noticed as the hard mode is kind of off, the reason for me to stat this is because the IA is dumb. well the mode itself is very hard and challenging but the enemies are running around like stupid and they won't start to shoot at you unless you get really really close. It's kind of annoying as the first mode was fun and very polished in my opinion, I don't know if it's the game or it's some kind of glitch."
3883,it's a fun FPS with guns and gear with stats. randomely generated guns can be fun but repetitive. its best parts are starting in DLC once you are high level or finished main story quest. i recommend Armory of General Knoxx DLC
3884,"I mean 9 years in and I am still playing the game! Don't let the hours fool you, I previously owned this game on console. 
Best Game Series Evah!"
3885,"PROS / CONS
+ Easy FPS runs on older computers.
+ Comedic.
+ Like playing through a comic book.
+ Gameplay is easy.
- Graphics are old console style.
- Gameplay is choppy.
- Guns are hard to aim, some have no sights or dont connect properly.
- Glitches and crashes during car scenes.
- Very Old School game styles.

I tried my best to give this game a fair chance, but it crashed too much.  

IF you like the older style games, or maybe for smaller kids who are just starting out this would be okay to get on a sale. 
For my full review you can check it out here:  https://www.someawesome.com/game-review/astararose/borderlands"
3886,"Borderlands is still fun, even after 10 years! You cant miss on this one."
3887,"Man, this game gives just the same amounts of fun it would give when it first came out. And even graphics, due to their  quite unusual style, did not et THAT old over the years!"
3888,I would have liked this game if it didn't have so many similarities with Fallout 3.
3889,"After many attempts, I still can't seem to get into this game for some reason. The initial part of the main campaign is just sooooo tedious and I lose interest within the first five hours every time I try and start a playthrough, regardless of character.

I'd rather play Titan Quest for an ARPG experience and DOOM for a shooter. The mix of the 2 genres just didn't click for me personally."
3890,splitscreen on xbox 360 was fun.
3891,"Just finished my third playthrough, still great.  I wasn't a huge fan of Siren on this turn about.  For myself it took until I got in to the 20s and redid her skills a bit before I really enjoyed what an unstoppable machine she can be.  Three types of elemental damage at once when using skills and weapon?  Absolutely!    

This is a game that never gets old for me.  <3"
3892,"As of 2018 Borderlands still holds up.

The graphics have adged a little but because they went for the cel-shaded aesthetic it's barely noticeable once you get into it. There's enough content to keep you busy for quite a few hours but some of the missions do get a bit repetitive at times, especially when you have to spend a long time going from place to place.

If you want to make the game easy complete all the side missions, I did and I found the end boss ridiculously easy. I'd recommend not completing all theside missions if you want a challenge.

Overall a fun game that will last you for 15+ hours, much better if you play with some friends"
3893,yes
3894,"[h1]Big maps filled with a horde of enemies, Millions of gun combinations and dark humor all fit into one large barrel o' fun.[/h1]

I have gotten my hands on this game way back in 2012 and back then, i didn't know what i was doing at all, but after a long break without playing the game, to then buy it back on Steam, i don't regret getting back into it at all.

This game has it all if you're looking for a loot-and-shoot game. There's weapons ranging from simple repeater pistols, to rocket launchers and alien weaponry (Eridian weapons may be a little disappointing). They can shoot flames, shock or acid too! On top of that, there's a bunch of different shield types, grenade mods and class mods, which, along with each character's skill trees, allow for dozens of different character builds. For a game from 2009, this game looks very good for it's time in terms of graphics. If your computer isn't that great, you can always optimize it further than normal. If you plan to buy this, your best bet is getting the GOTY ""Enhanced"" version. The ""Enhanced"" edition brings new features, but also new bugs, like memory leaks. However, it's more ideal if you will only play through the game once or twice.

Compared to Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel, this game barely manages to burn me out at all, for many reasons. It has a near infinite endgame where you can farm for the perfect weapon parts for every single unique weapon for hundreds, even thousands of hours. Also, this game has linear scaling. In comparison to x1.13 and x1.1 multiplicative scaling in Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel, it may be easier to balance, but if an enemy is a higher level than you, you will definitely notice it. Pearlescent rarity weapons -- The rarest vanilla gear you can get, and only obtainable in the Knoxx DLC -- are also still seriously satisfying to obtain, while in Borderlands 2, they're a guaranteed drop or a big disappointment. Not much excitement in that at all.

Of course, that doesn't mean that this game is perfect. Unlike it's successor, the skill trees are very simple. They can be built in any way without majorly affecting gameplay. If you truly look into it, you will also realize that this game's story is lacking and feels rushed, which is sorta true. The game has got lore and story, but most of it is in text form in the mission descriptions you complete, which is why it seems so lacking. The original game's graphics are also dated, but ReShade does bring some life to that.

To bring this review further to a close, if you manage to reach the point where the game becomes boring, get The Arsenal mod and Blitz, the custom playable Vault Hunter! The first Borderlands technically has mod support, but you can only access the full UDK with a retail copy of the game. Still, The Arsenal mod adds like 200 truly awe-inspiring weapons. More mods exist, like custom maps. Only get The Arsenal if you still want to play co-op!

I'm not done playing Borderlands for many, MANY more hours. There is so much I can still do, that I wouldn't be able to write it down in an hour. I'll enjoy the first Borderlands and try to keep it going for many more years. One of my favorite games of all time. Play this game and try leveling one character to the max at the very least, you won't be disappointed by what loot awaits you!

3902,"[h1]Guns inside an RPG with comedy and tons of expasions, welcome, to Borderlands[/h1]

[i]Borderlands is a mix of exploration and infinite quests, where you drive vehicles, play with 3 other friends, and do each of your friends save game.

Borderlands lets you choose between 5 classes if i'm not mistaken, each one has an unique skill, inside classes you have 3 skill trees, where you can choose if you want to be tank, a powerful guy, a sniper, a ninja, etc.

Borderlands has side quests where you loot, scavenge, or face a boss, there are a lot of cool locations and a nice soundtrack! Also, you have a level system, you need to explore in order go gain exp, each mission has a level requirement, such as your weapons, and shields! The game is totally in 1st person shooter.

If you wanna play co-op this is for you, there's also an arena where you need to fight, each is DLC is worth of buying, i suggest you take the GOTY edition, worth every euro, one of the biggest maps over there till today

Finishing, the graphics are pretty awesome, and the optimization is great, have not finished the game yet, let me tell you, is more than 40 hours.[/i]"

Still both of them are juste awesome ... don't hesitate try them out"
3912,"A neat co-op shooter that you should play with friends. You can do it solo, but it will probably be less fun.

The game has a story, but its mostly a reason to go out and kill stuff. The guns are similar to RPG type loot as they have random stats and effects. And for the most part, it doesnt work out that well. In the latter game, enemies become increasingly diffuclt to kill (bullet spunges even if you use elemental damage that theyre weak against). Plus the enemies do a ton of damage against you, where you basically see no difference in your shield usefullness or HP bar increase. Basically, game balance is rather shity. 

You have a choice from several characters, where you can specialise them for particular playstyles.

The setting and atmosphere are really nice, even though the story and its progression are kind of weak.

For one playthrough the game could be alright. Its more fun with friends, but that doesnt take away from its inherent game design weaknesses. It could have been a lot better if the devs decided to put some more thought into it.

For 1 playthrough, its pretty alright, after that it becomes a grind.

There is better stuff out there.

3917,its like borderlands 2 but with less 2.
3918,"I was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said, ""I never seen a man, who looks so all alone
And could you use a little company?
If you can pay the right price, your evening will be nice
But you can go and send me on my way""
I said, ""You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?""
She looked at me and this is what she said
Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good
Not even fifteen minutes later after walking down the street
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight
And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight
He said, ""Give me all you've got, I want your money not your life
But if you try to make a move I won't think twice""
I told him, ""You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask
What made you want to live this kind of life?""
He said
Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good
Well now a couple hours past and I was sitting in my house
The day was winding down and coming to an end
And so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend
I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same
Oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills
Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
We got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no we can't slow down, we can't hold back
Though you know we wish we could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good"
3919,"Best Borderlands Game till now, way better than Borderlands 2 , No forced Jokes or totally retarded. This  Game shows you a fucked up Mad Max like World with Psychos and it makes Sense, this World is Brutal, Hard and has a lot Loot to offer if you dare to accept the Challenge.
I really liked Borderlands 2 but i LOVED Borderlands 1 even today, besides the Main Game are 4 Addons, which are all Great and offer new Story and a lot more Loot. Highly Recommended Game."

It is awesome, really I am throughly enjoying this and hearing that the second one is even better has me wanting to get through this and start the second one as soon as possible."
3924,"Borderlands is a cheerful RPG combined with some FPS elements. There are tons of custimizations, weapons, missions, quests and DLCs to enjoy.

Would definately recommend all FPS players to have played this at some point in there gaming history."

3930,"[h1] Sketch of a mayhem.	[/h1]


Boy, that had to be a colossally fun ride in 2009. However, we live in a world almost ten years later, where two more Borderlands game exist (and seems third one’s on its way). 

Unfortunately, original Borderlands does not age well, mostly because of comparisons to its enormously successful sequel (and pre-sequel). Original game feels more like a sketch, a demo or a first draft with some bold but still very safe steps. 

Visual style of Borderlands is intriguing, yet it’s rather bleak comparing to next instances. Locations mostly look the same: wasteland is wasteland and color pallet explores every shade of brownish-grey. Lack of voice overs and quite arid soundtrack frustrates heck out of me, especially during such a fast-paced gameplay. 

Talking about gameplay, it is repetitive AF. Especially in the last third of a game, when leveling system fails to match your environment and your character - it’s just not that fun to one-shot everything that moves. Story not worth it at all, and most of the characters you meet are really-really thin. 

Despite all of that, thank god almighty for Borderlands, because a lot of features, assets and, what I suppose to be, unused ideas migrated forward to next project. This alone gives game thumbs up for being a reason Borderlands 2 is awesome.

Keeping conclusion short and simple: [b] it’s fine, but I suggest to skip it[/b]. Go straight to the sequel, where all above mentioned cons are fixed and pros are improved on a few levels. Or buy it for collector’s sake together with a bundle."
3931,A good game for 2018 from 2009 this says it all.
3932,"This is the worst Borderlands game out of all 4. Hitmarkers in this game are utter crap. Graphics are very much behind borderlands 2. Missions feel tedious, humour feels unoriginal and sometimes cringy. I just play this game for borderlands loyalty rewards and achievements."
3933,Fun with friends!
3934,"One of the best games ever made
worth the price"
3935,"What say about Borderlands...
Borderlands have:
+Fantasy and stupid thinks;
+Charismatics characters;
+A lot of jokes;
+So much explosions;
-Some bugs that upset the game;
-Unfortunately, only a few side quests.

CLAPTRAP IS THE BEST CHARACTER IN THE UNIVERSE"
3936,A classic in the single player fps genre.
3937,Some of the most fun I've had with friends from my childhood.
3938,Only 22 hours into it again and still loving it!
3939,Boring and not engaging. Also no skipable intro and cutscenes....... Plot is mediocre at best...... Would not buy......
3940,"Good fun, I love the world, quests, characters, combat. The only problem I found was the shit loot system. 99% of weapons I find are useless(much worse than the ones I have) so looting is not fun and it takes like 1/3 of game


7/10"
3941,I'm having a lot of fun; The multipkayer puts the icing on the cake. Definately a game worth having.
3942,"terribly optimized piece of shit, with all the cartoonish graphics you'd think it could run even on a raw potato but no, the frame rate drops below 20 on my PC which it runs smoothly with most of the game cameout after 2015 like division and witcher 3, so yeah i blame the game."
3943,"Look this game may be almost a decade old, but it's still very fun to play and a decent time waster of an FPS RPG. Highly recommended to play with a friend by the way. If you like some humor to it, prepare for some laughs."
3944,"FPS have never really been an interest of mine, being a millenium baby raised on Nintendo consoles. But after playing borderlands for a while now, I can safely say that I have changed my personal policy on these types of games.

Borderlands is story-rich (albeit slow-paced) in nature, with the gameplay working towards the end goal of finding the elusive vault. The characters all have their own interesting personalities and backstories, which makes getting to know them throughout the course of the game all the more satisfying. The controls are simple, and the different types of weapons, shields and mods allow for a more customized experience. The open world nature of the game allows for more freedom when straying from the linear storyline, especially when you don't feel like working on the main quests. 

The slower pace is both a blessing and a curse. Though it allows for a level of immersion that feels somewhat true to life, it can get stale pretty quickly. As someone with a bit of an addictive personality, I will often find myself spacing out for hours whilst doing quests. This may not be a bad thing for everyone, but I do wish it was slightly faster.

I'm so glad that I listened to my fellow gamer friends and picked this game up on sale. I've really enjoyed myself so far, and i'm excited to continue exploring Pandora and all it has to offer ^-^"
3945,"I can't recommend this game at all. The problem is I started out with Borderlands 2 which is a great game. In comparison, Borderlands is a mind numbing boring grind."
3946,good loot n shoot
3947,"Great Game! Had alot of fun playing, Can't wait for Borderlands 3."
3948,GREAT GAME
3949,game is always fun! even better wuith friends!
3950,Average Borderlands game.
3951,"Older but good for its time. Well worth palying for its own sake as well as to provide a better context for the rest of the series. Especially fond of the four player co-op element. Getting hard to find in more recent games. The DLCs are fairly good as well, cumulatively providing roughly as much content as the original game. Some of the achievements are a bit tedious (not difficult or rather not only difficult) to acquire, however."
3952,10/10 love this game. played countless hours on PS3 and bought it without hesistation on PC
3953,"The first game from the Borderlands franchise. The game is exactly like what it should be. It's fun, it's loud, it's chaotic. Great story. Decent graphics considering it is a 2009 game.
I am gonna point out some things that I kind of disliked about this game :
1. It's a slow, very slow game compared to BL2.
2. Gun levelling of this game is sooooo bad. I literally played my entire 2nd playthrough with level 36-39 level guns because the higher level guns being dropped in the game were crap.
3. Fast travel in this game was bad. In General Knoxx DLC one has to literally travel through the whole map to progress the game. There is absolutely no fast travel station in this DLC and every time one restarts the game, he will spawn at T-bone junction irrespective of where he left the game last time.
.
Otherwise this is a great game, with a great story. It's a must play for all Borderlands franchise lovers <3"
3954,"Good game, played a few years after it came out with some friends, and again in 2018. The graphics and gameplay hold up even now, and it is still fun to play even alone. The DLC (with the personal dislike of the underdome riot) is worth it and adds to the gameplay. Theres a bit of an issue with overleveling if you play the DLC, but thats another issue. I didn't do a new game plus, but thats an option to extend the playtime. 20 Hours is what it took to do the singleplayer playthrough with 3/4 of the DLC."
3955,"game and dlc good

very nice i recommend"
3956,"I  the game so far is very good, but I have no one to play with."
3957,"I started it around 3 years ago. I got bored at first, especially by the story, which was not as good as expected considering the popularity. 
What made me go back to it was the Telltale game “Tales from the Borderlands” (which is excellent btw) thanks to which I understood a little more the Borderlands universe.
Now that I play Borderlands 2, I can still say that the main story in the first game is good but not enough. You just have to kill enemies and get the Vault key. However, the small side quests compensated by far the lack of main story. And the DLC were much more elaborated.
I don’t need to talk about the graphics, there are awesome and unique. The graphics and the omnipresent humor is what make this game excellent. I had a lot of fun playing it.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=471048322

I got all the achievements in around 100 hours. 
Even though I had fun playing the game, I hate having to replay multiple times, first to get to level 61 and second with every character to kill a certain amount of enemies with their special kill.
Grinding oil cans, panties, pizza, fish in a bag, bobbleheads in claptrap DLC was not fun either.
Spending 12 hours in big tournaments killing countless waves of enemies was boring, but at least I met great players (because it is too hard to finish those tournaments alone).
And killing Crawmerax was an absolute pain in the… nose. Even with the well-known glitch.
So yeah, I’m proud of this 100%. At least, the feeling you get when seeing “you’ve unlocked every single achievement. Congratulations!” was worth it.

I highly and with no doubt, recommend it.

[h1] A good game with lots of shortcomings [/h1]

You know, the main reason why I started this steam challenge was to experience the games I own that I have not played before. Of course, I am also glad when I play a familiar game I liked in the past, but it can often feel like a chore; namely, many games are only good for one playthrough and nothing else. 

When it first came out, Borderlands turned a lot of heads. An open world first-person-shooter with cel-shaded graphics with a dark sense of humor, tons of loot and multiplayer. Sounds great and it was great, or at least that’s how I remember it to be on the Xbox 360. Well, actually, the more I think about it, the more I keep wondering why I liked the game so much… I remember really hating the arena DLC but other than that I just remember generally liking the game. So what’s the problem with Borderlands?

[h1] Fantastic controls and gameplay loop [/h1]

First, let me praise this game a little bit. Borderlands has fantastic controls, great weapons, appealing graphics and is generally a lot of fun to play. It’s incredibly easy to just jump into this game and play it for a couple of hours and have a good laugh. 

The premise takes place on the planet of Pandora. Now Pandora is a typical Mad Max or Fallout dystopian words with psychopaths with mask killing everything that moves, armored vehicles, ridiculously overpowered weapons, dangerous fauna, junk and a lot of sweet loot. You play as one of four Vault Hunters who comes to Pandora in order to find… gosh… I don’t know what a Vault Hunter could possibly want to find… Either way this “Thing” is apparently just a myth but upon landing on the planet a mysterious vision of a girl tells you that IT is indeed real and guides you on your way in order to find it. What follows is an open world game filled with main quests, side quests and a lot of random killing of NPCs. One of the most satisfying things in this game is how many actual weapons it has. The weapon system is very similar to the one in blizzard games like World of Warcraft and Diablo where weapons, depending on the color, can be common, uncommon, rare or even rarer than that. It is a great feeling when you kill a tough boss and he/she drops an epic assault rifle that almost triples the amount of damage you were doing just moments ago. Depending on which character you choose, you will get different skills also similar to the ones found in Blizzard games. Each character has a special skills and as you level them up they can unlock new skills and bonuses which can greatly enhance your way of playing. Another great addition to this game is the “last stand” system. When your character runs of shield and health you will enter the “last stand” mode. In this mode, you have a few seconds to kill an enemy. If you fail to this, you will die and be respawned at the nearest checkpoint, however, if you manage to kill a single enemy, you will get back up with a full shield. It seems like an overpowered addition but after witnessing how easy it can be to die in this game, I love the “last stand”. Borderlands is definitely more fun with friends. Grab a friend or three and complete the whole game with them. It’s incredibly easy to join someone’s game and to drop out. While playing in multiplayer, the enemies get tougher but the loot gets better too.

So, in a way Borderlands is a lot of fun and under normal circumstances it should be worth a buy. However, a couple of things prevent me from giving this game a recommendation even though I really enjoyed it years ago. 

[h1] Borderlands 1 lacks a proper story [/h1]

The biggest reason is probably its sequel: Borderlands 2 https://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands_2/, which is an improvement over Borderlands in every single way. 
So you may be thinking: “Who cares if the sequel is better, I still wish to experience the story of the first game” and while I would say that such an opinion is admirable, Borderlands … doesn’t really have a story. Don’t get me wrong, it tries to tell a story but it fails in almost every single way. You are searching for this vault, go do a bunch of quests until you find it; that’s the story. Seriously, the story is probably one of the worst aspects of this game, and the ending is one of the most disappointing endings in gaming history.

“Well, who cares about the story, the gameplay and the quests are still good, right?” wrong, well half-wrong. The gameplay is excellent, but the quests are just… well… kinda like Blizzard game quests as well: go kill 10 of these and come back. Go to this location and gather a bunch of these things and come back. They get boring really fast. The only things that really keeps you going is the flow of the game where you level up and eventually get better weapons and become a stronger character, that’s what this game is really all about. Alas, that trip can get very boring and repetitive, which is why I couldn’t even bother finishing this game a second time. 

So, if you are looking for an open world game with lots of guns, shooting, quests and a good multiplayer, just get Borderlands 2 or Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel https://store.steampowered.com/app/261640/Borderlands_The_PreSequel/. This one, while I can’t deny that it paved the way for the next two games, just isn’t that good anymore. 

[h1] I'd only play this one if you REALLY NEED another Borderlands game AFTER playing
all other games in the series [/h1]

I would recommend getting this game ONLY, AND ONLY IF you have a bunch of friends who love co-op shooters and need something new to play (provided that they played both Borderlands 2 and Borderlands The Pre-sequel, but that’s just my opinion.

Next game: Borderlands 2 (the one you should play instead of this one)

3962,"The best looter shooter in my opinion. 
Excellent game mechanichs, great story, memorable characters, a load of guns and tons of fun (wether playing solo or co-op) makes this one of my all time favorites; I highly recommend it for anyone who haven't played it yet."
3963,"Obviously I loved this game, Borderlands is my favorite video game series. I loved playing this on Xbox 360 and enjoyed replaying it just as much on PC. The only thing I have to say about the Steam version is that the game is 100% playable with a controller. It's listed as ""partial controller support"", but the only thing that was not supported by controller use was a few options in the map menu."
3964,solid fps with rpg style elements!
3965,"I played it long time ago without steam, and just got it in bundle with borderlands 2.

Personally I like Borderlands 1 a bit more, because of the classes, which seem to have more impact than in the sequel.
The maps are a bit smaller so you don't have to travel that huge distances. The story DLC's are always fun and add new places and ideas.

One of the best coop games. I recommend to start with this one incl. the story DLC's and of course some friends!

3980,GREATEST GAME I'VE PLAYED IN A LONG TIME.
3981,"TL;DR
Ungraceful start to a good series. Buy only on a deep sale, but worth playing for a series fan.

Pros and cons:
+ Lots of guns
+ 4 characters with distinct playstyles
+ Basic gameplay loop is fun
+ Lasts long time
+ 1 DLC is pretty good

- Some annoying shooting mechanics
- Bland environments
- Weak enemy variety
- Bad plot with terrible ending
- 2 DLC's are meh
- 1 DLC is bad
- FOV is bad but you can fix it

In depth, no spoiler feature review:

+ Guns
The variety of different weapons to use is the main highlight. There are multiple weapon manufacturers and each of them has their own style and stats preferences. For example Vladof makes guns that have high fire rate at the expense of accuracy, while Jacobs guns have highest damage but generally fire and reload slowly. The constant hunt for better weapons is the main drive of the game, and it feels really good to find a rare gun with special effects.

+ Characters and abilities
There are 4 characters to choose from, each has their own playstyle with 1 active ability and 3 passive skill trees. The only problem is that passives are mostly boring stat increases. There are some cool abilities though, like being able to bypass enemie's shields or dealing damage over time to enemies around you.

+ Basic gameplay loop and length
Same as in any looter-shooter or hack-n-slash game, you take quests, kill enemies and grab loot. Nothing out of the ordinary here, but guns make the game fun as described above. It will take 40+ hours to get to max level and at that point you can still have fun hunting for better equipment. And that's only for one character, so basically this game has a good amount of content for you to enjoy.

+ Knoxx DLC
Has decent story with some cool characters and dialogue. It's padded a little with unskippable driving segments but overall very fun to play through. Plus, it has some unique, cool weapons that are available only in this DLC

- Annoying shooting mechanics
There are 2 basic things that make shooting annoying. 1st is the fact that every time you get hit your crosshair jumps up a lot. This makes sniping a total pain in the ass. Before you say that this is how it's supposed to work I'll just say that in Borderlands 2 Gearbox fixed this issue and almost completly removed the screen shake on taking damage.
The second thing is less important. The enemies move erratically, skipping a lot of animations and making aiming at long range difficult.
Bassically don't play as a sniper as you will spend a long time waiting for enemies to stop shooting and moving so you can line up your shots. Main oher gun types and thank me later.

- Bland environments
In the main game there are very boring areas you'll go through. Mostly wastelands and run-down towns. DLC'c fix the problem only a little.

- Weak enemy variety
For the most parts you will fight other dudes with guns. They come in 3 basic varieties - ranged, melee and big guys. Each of these types can also spawn as a 'badass' version which is stronger and has better drop chance for good items. The other enemies are flying rakks that dive-bomb you, the skags that are basically mutated dogs and the spider-things that have to be shot in their abdomens in order to kill them effectively.
There are some bosses too, but nothing too original. Oh and the last boss is terrible. If not for guns being so cool this game would be boring. Because of the unoriginal and unfun enemies.

- Bad plot with terrible ending
Not gonna waste time to describe how bad the plot is. It's bad. Let's move on.

- Ned zombies and Claptrap revolution DLCs are meh
They don't add anything interesting to the game. Ned DLC has some funny dialogue, and Claptrap DLC lets you kill Claptraps which are annoying as hell so that's good, but other than that they aren't all that fun to play through more than once.

- Moxxi's Underdome DLC is bad
It's a set of arenas with a challange roulette. Challanges inlcude things like giving enemies better guns, or making them extra fast. It's fun only for the first map after which you are sick of this DLC. There's no XP to be got from killing enemies in the arenas and items rewarded are same random drops you could get from anywhere else. The only reason to bother with this DLC is the skillpoints you get if you complete it's main quest for the first and second playthroughs. These are bonus skillpoints that you can't get anywhere else.

- FOV
A minor point, because you can easly fix FOV through config files. Google will tell you how.

So to sum up...
Game is ok if you can get it for 10$ or less, but don't bother with it unless you really want to see how the series started. Play the better Borderlands 2 or Pre-sequel instead as they fix most of the first game's problems like the lack of good plot and screen shake, while also giving you better fleshed out skill trees and even more cool weapons.

I would give Borderlands 1 a 6/10. I had fun for the most part of my 45+hourse of playtime."

3983,Old but Gold!!
3984,"Welcome to Pandora! That is the name of the treacherous, yet beloved planet that you will be exploring in this amazing title. Take on the dangers of Pandora by using 1 of 4 class types that all have their very wonderful perks while they search for a fabled and mysterious ""Vault"". People who do this are known as Vault Hunters.

The Siren, Lilith, is the class that I prefer. She has the ability to phase through dimensions. Very useful to escape danger in a pinch or just get to places quicker without a vehicle. She has proficiencies with elemental damage and SMGs.

The Hunter, Mordecai, is the second class that I prefer. He commands a friendly alien bird named Bloodwing. Bloodwing will attack enemies when released. Mordecai has proficiencies with Sniper Rifles and Pistols.

The Berserker, Brick, is the third class that I prefer. He utilizes his fists in a massive rage while gaining increased melee damage and health regeneration. He has proficiencies with Explosive and Melee damage.

The Commando, Roland, is the last class that I prefer. He utilizes a self-deployable portable turret. This turret is good for distracting enemies, killing enemies and so much more. He has proficiencies with Combat Rifles and Shotguns.

Every character has a unique approach to reaching the end of the game and becoming the greatest Vault Hunter Pandora has ever known. How will you approach the challenge?"
3985,"good game, play with grandkids and only draw back is having to go back to the beginning when new player wants to join in.."
3986,"It's... nice I guess. I tried the game out just for a bit within the refund window.

If you are completely accustomed to Borderlands 2, this game isn't really the best game for you as it feels like a developing-state version of the game. I feel like things could have been so much better, but I can't blame people who love it either.

It's just not my cup of tea."
3987,Game that started it all. Lots of fun. Borderlands 2 is a great improvement.
3988,"I liked it a lot. 2 really good main characters and a great support cast. It was funny too. As much as I think telltale need to try and change their formula a bit, I do enjoy their games."
3989,"it's a fun game, sure but it seems like it's missing something. and after playing borderlands 2 i can tell that they wanted this game to be like borderlands 2 but they wernt sure how to do it. 

it's still a very fun game but i'd wait for a sale"
3990,Interesting story-line. Most enjoyed the ability to get together with friends and wreak some havoc.
3991,tt
3992,the precursor to (in my opinion) one of the greatest FPS games ever made.
3993,Boom!
3994,a good game my BOIS

3996,"It's like the second borderlands, but like, older."
3997,"Borderlands is one of the best games I have ever played,"

4000,"I had a blast playing this game, though when I tried to play multiplayer it seems co op is dead. But, you can always invite your buddies to tag along and go through adventures together. Or go alone, its entirely up to you. EIther way, the gameplay was fun and has some pretty good challenge. The storyline was pretty interesting too. This game involves level up system so you cant just kill every enemy you see, you might face enemies higher level than you which is alot difficult. There are some guns with stats. You also choose a character as you like, which each has their own skills and abilities, including their gun preference.

Keep noted however, you can use ANY gun despite which character you choose. Its just what info shows for that character is what they are good at. My advice, use THOSE guns that they are good at, because it has benefits that can help you fight enemies easier. Choose them carefully so you can use those weapons (in my case, I have a character who prefers assault rifles and shotgun, so I put them in the first and second slot (theres a total of 4 slots, which is unlockable)).

When I have 4 slots, I would have assault rifle, shotgun, rocket launcher, and sniper rifle. So despite my character is more of assault rifle and shotgun, you can still make use on other weapons. Do some damage on enemies that are further away or simply you want to have more explosives in your slots. You also have a shield that regenerates and health which of course you need healing to keep yourself going. If your health is lost, you will be at last stand, kill enemies to get a ""second wind"" (which is self revive). Failure to be rescued or self revive will teleport you at the save area and you lose money. Theres alot of adventures in this game.

I highly recommend this."
4001,"Good game, my old system with an I5 650 dule core 3.2ghz 4 logics, 12gb ddr3 ram, 2gb GT 610 grapgics card, im running on high to max settings depending how hot I want my system to run, 78C Maxx. One Epic Co-Op game for friends to play together."
4002,Great game! I played this game originally on xbox 360 and decided to buy it and play it through again with a friend. Definatily worth the money!
4003,A masterpiece example of a loot and shoot. Grinded this shit when I was young.
4004,fantastic game. funny story. love the graphics
4005,Great game.
4006,wach chui sau li fael
4007,"Great game, but I don't even have it in my Library..."
4008,"Borderlands is a wild, exciting, and highly entertaining game. The combat is great, the quests are fun, and the humor is fantastic. Each character brings a new perspective and combat style to the table, allowing for plenty of replayability. You can also restart a new game with a character that you finished the game on--in essence replaying the whole game but at a higher level so you can enjoy a playthrough with more talent points and better weapons. 

Do yourself a favor and buy this game. It is well worth the price, even when not on sale.

Hell, go ahead and treat yourself with the ""Game of the Year Edition."" The added content is WELL worth the price. Each expansion is fun and contains pure comedic gold (looking at you in particular, Claptrap's Robot Revolution). 

tldr: BUY THIS GAME

Combat: 9/10

4010,Still fun for an older game.
4011,"Despites Borderlands being ten years old, its still enjoyable and fun to play. Even better when you're playing with friends in co-op. The comic style, humour and characters are unique. There are four playable characters to choose from. Everyone of them has their own special skill attack. The DLC packs are not a waste of money."
4012,Just randomly writing reviews and recommending things so people on my friends list have a wider set of options to play during the spring cleaning event.
4013,tis good
4014,"There practically isn't anything left to say which hasn't been said yet. Yes, [i]Borderlands 2[/i] is newer, prettier, and has overall more content, but that doesn't make its predecessor a bad game.
In my humble opinion, [i]Borderlands[/i] has aged incredibly well, both gameplay and graphic wise. The iconic comic style never gets old. Singleplayer is fun, but it's a real blast to play with friends in co-op. Four different classes, each with their own unique RPG-like branching skill tree add replay value, as well as the lootables - no two weapons are the same, with incendinary, corrosive, shock, or explosive damage if ordinary bullets won't do it for you. Some missions can be frustrating, but they're never unfair (well, maybe except for Crawmerax if you try to take him on all by yourself), and once you're done, you feel like you've actually achieved something. The EXP system is well balanced, you won't get overleveled too easily, and if you happen to be [i]underleveled[/i], you're free to roam Pandora and shoot some bandits or skags or do some DLC missions.
I've hardly ever played shooters as they're not my cup of tea, but even if you're not into them, [i]Borderlands[/i] is well worth a try. While it's definitely worth the full price, it's on sale with 75% off once in a while, which is a steal considering its content and replay value.
Plus, you can always play [i]Borderlands 2[/i] afterwards. :D

(My apologies for any mistakes, English isn't my native language. Peace out!)"
4015,OIL CAN
4016,"This game is a very good game for those that like to free roam and play it thier way. of course there happens to be a fine storyline for those that love a good game that will send them off into thier own imagination.

the mulitplayer is meant for hours of endless fun and is great for all players of all ages!"
4017,good
4018,"It's an expansive open-ish world rpg that uses FPS gameplay and Diablo style loot and monsters.

If all of that appeals to you, borderlands probably will too.  Everything it does works very well"
4019,This game is just perfect in every way possible.
4020,cool game
4021,good game even though not as good as borderland 2.............recomended................unfortunately hard to find friends to play co op
4022,"Very nice game! 
(I'm going to write a better review later, I just need to review the most games I can, the fastest I can)"
4023,"good
"
4024,This game is amazing I can hardly put it in words there are a few glitches but nothin overall game breaking in fact their quite hillarius 100/10
4025,"I get a quest to find some stuff. I go clear that area, bring that stuff to complete the quest, than 15 mins later i get a new quest to go to the exact same fkn area and activate something. So i have to clear 2-3-4-5 times the same area for different quests. Why can't i do all the quests in one run to begin with?
Maybe it's a good game overall but this aspect makes me quit playing it. i can't stand going to some dungeon for the 4th time to complete the quest. Waaaay too slow paced and repetitive."
4026,"What do you get when you add an element of ""accuracy"" to an FPS game? Neurotics from people who like bullets to go, where they aim.
Weak story.
One sidequest used over.
No sense of progress loadout wise and level wise- loadout matches the strength of enemies who match your level, making it feel static. 
Honestly, I expected a lot more. I expected good FPS, for reason I stated earlier, mainly. Also while being downed and shooting someone point blank, I would expect a hit. But that is probably just me.
I expected at least some significance from RPG elements- maxed out crit and headshot dmg, strongest sniper rifle at my level and still i don't onetap enemies starting at lvl 25 and above :) . Also I would expect a level lead when i spent all my points in faster leveling as soon I could aaaaaand I actually got behind level? Doing all sidequests? I guess clearing every area only once is just wrong.
1/10 for shittiest game I've ever played. Honestly I don't even feel like playing the second one anymore. What a shame, man."
4027,"Not bad for an old game,but the price should be droped."
4028,"Fun for a while but gets grindy pretty fast. Lots of weapons to the point of there being too many weapons. Weapons aren't all that different from each other; there are just a lot of them. This wouldn't be a drawback if the weapons were more unique/varied, but as it is it just feels like a grindy sorting game (trying to find the next weapon that is slightly better than your last). There is a good amount of comedy in this game, which is a nice addition. Seems to be a well-programmed, higher budget game. Would be more interesting if the enemies/battles were more varied, made more use of the environment, etc. - as it is, it seems to just be a tedious war of numbers. First person viewpoint, which can be nauseating if you get motion sickness from such things (thankfully, the arid environment and tendency to spend most of your time in the open outdoors minimizes this aspect). Difficulty balance can be a huge issue - the game seems to adjust to provide a challenge for the strongest person on your team, so, if you are playing with even one person who is much stronger than you, enemies will probably just wipe you out (meaning the strongest person is the only one encountering a fun challenge and everyone else is just being used to mop the floor, so to speak). More variability (in environment, enemy strength/abilities, weaponry, etc.) would improve the game greatly.
Not really a ""bad"" game, not really a ""good"" game. For me, this game was mediocre. I'd give it a slight thumbs up (I guess...?), but certainly not an enthusiastic one. To be honest, I'm currently oscillating between choosing ""yes"" and ""no"" for recommending this game. It is not my kind of game, but I know there is a significant section of people who do enjoy games like this. So, I will recommend it with this caveat: if you dislike grinding, mundane/repetitious environments/enemies, and huge numbers of worthless drops, this game probably isn't for you. If you like (or at least don't mind) these things, it might be fun, at least for a while."
4029,"PIECE OF A FKN SHIT
CANT ENJOY THIS OLD CRAP
HOW CAN SOMEONE RATE THIS GAME BETTER THAN BO2
IT GAVE ME CANCER TY"
4030,Broderlands 2 is good but not this shit. crashes ..... bugs ..... low level even if you do every side quest
4031,It's like a Borderlands game but there aren't any memes in it.
4032,"FPSs aren't really my thing and I hadn't played an FPS for maybe 10 years when I accepted trying this out because of a friend's insistence and my honest intention was to tell my friend ""it's fine but you know, not my thing"", so that I would've complied with his request and lose like half an hour playing an FPS. That's how biased I was against playing Borderlands when I started.

But boy was I in for a ride. The cut-throat atmosphere, dark humour and especially the loot system right away from the get go got me interested. I kept playing and realized I wasn't that bad of a shot, it was freakishly fun, the skill system and the player characters you get to choose are super cool and the game in general is well super-badass-cool. A wasteland world full of drug pumped bandits, mutated vicious animals and the best part is, well, you're no better, you're a cut-throat mercenary in search of legendary lost alien riches and technologies. The friendly NPCs or ""good guys"" you get to meet during your travels are also shady characters fitting the premise incredibly well.

Oh and the loot. All weapons, grenade mods and shields are randomly generated from a pool of different parts that give properties to those weapons. An SMG for instance is comprised of its body, stock, magazine, barrel, sight and accessory; sight and accessory being optional. The combination of these parts as well as the properties granted by manufacturer of the weapon(there are 9) and material grade determines how much recoil it has, what title it gets, how much bullet velocity it has, how accurate it is and everything else that is relevant. Maybe it has parts that are legendary or unique in which case special mechanics such as firing bullets in a tornado pattern or all sorts of crazy things can happen. The accessories can grant elemental properties to weapons in which case they can set on fire, shock or corrode enemies or fire explosive rounds. These elemental damage types work better or worse against certain enemies as you can imagine. There are repeater pistols, machine pistols, revolvers, combat shotguns, assault shotguns, smgs, combat rifles, machine guns, pump-action sniper rifles, semi-automatic sniper rifles and rocket launchers and the variety even without unique or legendary weapons is simply mind-boggingly awesome, I enjoyed at least one hundred different weapons through a single playthrough, some with subtler differences, some with very unique styles. Even legendary or unique items follow the same weapon generation pattern so a weapon gets the legendary status thanks to one part of it that grants its legendary property and rest are still random so, infinite loot possibilities! There are grenade mods that modify how your grenades work, for example are they proximity mines, rubberized, MIRV etc. which work differently and are great in certain situations and not so great in others. Shields are also variable in cool properties as such with random parts and everything.

This game is an absolute masterpiece. After 4 playthroughs(pure solo or pure co-op) with each of the 4 characters, spending over 450 hours, I am now a deadeye shooter, measuring distance and bullet velocity and movement of enemy from the iron sights of a revolver for a crit from 100 metres, jump crits, landing sticky grenades on bandit midget psychos' faces and all sorts of badass FPS feats. 4 different characters have over ten class mods each which support certain builds of these characters. In order to get the most out of the game I switched class mods every 5 levels for 8-12 different playstyles during a single playthrough thanks to simple and non-punishing respec mechanic. And I still want to play more but I just forced myself to move on to Borderlands 2.

DLCs of this game are a lot of fun as well so I'd suggest you to buy a game of the year edition or something of the sort that gets you everything. If you like any of the following even remotely you must buy and play this game: Shooting, grabbing loot, violence, grim and merciless settings, dark humor, awesomeness, badassitude.

For people who played Borderlands 2 but not 1:
Before saying anything else, if you liked 2 you should absolutely play this! I now have over 200 hours in BL2 as well and it's great and everything but there are a couple of things I miss from BL1. BL2 has way too many fancy laser(e-tech) or gyro-jet weapons with low bullet velocity and I personally like regular weapons more cause you know, you shoot and the bullet lands right away. I don't know, they are nice every now and then and they exist in BL1 as well but not as many. BL2 is quite a bit more sci-fi in terms of the arsenal of weapons you use so BL1 feels cooler for me. The weapon generation in BL1 is better in my opinion too, it is a bit simplified in BL2 I think.(stockXbarrel determines title etc.) I'm not so sure about this claim about weapon generation being worse in BL2. I couldn't learn the mechanics as deeply as I did for BL1 yet but one thing is worse for sure and that is that the weapon naming is VERY lame in BL2.

Take a randomly generated weapon name from BL1: Jakobs DVL350 Fearsome Thunder, this is a common semi-auto sniper. 
Let's break it down: Jakobs(manufacturer of the gun) DVL350(depending on manufacturer material grade and type of weapon this is a generated code that follows certain patterns) Fearsome(its prefix granted because it doesn't qualify for a special prefix but possesses overall high stats) Thunder(common title given to the group of sniper rifles with high damage)

A randomly generated weapon name from BL2: Bandit Fire Fire Burny, this is a common SMG.
Let's break it down:Bandit(manufacturer of the gun) Fire Fire(prefix granted for a reason for sure but I don't know the exact mechanics) Burny(Title given to SMGs that have their bodies made by Bandit manufacturer(which also determines the overall manufacturer of the weapon) and their barrels made by Maliwan(manufacturer) that have fire element)

I didn't handpick these names to prove my point, I randomly picked them(using randomDOTorg) among ""weapon title"" pages on the borderlands wiki. The problem with Borderlands 2 naming scheme is that for all weapons title is given due to the combination of body and barrel which has two adverse effects: 1-Too many weapon titles st it is hard to make sense and become familiar with and they had to make up crappy names like ""Burny"" as in this example 2-Title selection is very simple and straightforward, just checks what body and barrel it has but because of this it doesn't give away much about the weapon. Other than titles the weapon code that is ""DVL350"" in this example is extremely cool in my opinion, makes the gun's name sound like a real weapon name and it isn't some repetitive crap same code every gun because it is intelligently randomly generated. Why would you drop this very cool flavor in weapon naming and why would you make the naming in general much less awesome in BL2 I don't know Gearbox.

I love BL2 too and there are some improved features compared to BL1 but these are a couple of things I like better in BL1.

4033,"This game is hours of fun. Great graphics for the time (still holds up relatively well) and the storyline just sucks you in. The DLCs are all 100% worth it as you'll just want more to play once you're done the main story. Personally, my favourite game of all time. Played ~400 hours on console back in the day. Recommended"
4034,"Fantastic game, weapon generation is fun, but at this point jsut buy Borderlands 2."
4035,"a decent fps, but pretty boring without friends"
4036,This game is 18x better with Cage the Elephant's original album playing in the background on loop at all times. 9/10 Claptrap should be playable.
4037,Chances are you already know if you like Borderlands or not. You don't need me to tell you.
4038,"It is by far the worst game I played with ok world and mechanics. The quest system kills it all. This game is so BOOOORING. Missions are dull and repetitive that it was hard for me to even keep track of it after first few hours. Just go there kill this or bring that. Characters have potential but boredomness that fills this game is overwhelming. Multiplayer isn't better too, you have to fight over who you play with to get the loot and it doesn't get less boring. It is too much content that is just few missions repeating over and over in another locations. BLEH"
4039,"Great story, for a cartoonish game."
4040,Extremely fun
4041,I absolutely love this game. It makes me laugh so hard while I murder people.
4042,"Entertaining and comedic game.  Fairly easy to get the hang of and is more of an artistic cell shaded game.  The basic fundamental aspects of the game revolve around a dystopian planet struggling to survive and a variety of element matching for enemies.  Also, it should be said that there is a pretty excessive variety of weapons of all types and the game progresses as an fps rpg."
4043,"Let’s get one thing out of the way up front: I do indeed have sixty hours logged in Borderlands. Of those sixty hours, about twenty were repeated efforts over several years to play through the game solo and burning out before reaching the second town. The other forty were slogging through the entire game and all the DLC with my co-workers in a last-ditch attempt to actually experience everything. And I succeeded, obviously, but I put more stock in the quality of the company than the quality of the game. We’ll dig into why that is, of course, but right on the surface it should be clear why I wouldn’t recommend a game that I couldn’t break into without some serious heavy lifting from my friends.

The backwater hellhole planet Pandora hides a dark secret, the mysterious Vault said to contain unimaginable riches. Drifters from all over its dusty reaches and beyond have thrown away their lives in search of this treasure, and your motley group of four is just the most recent in a long line of fools. But there’s an equally mysterious lady in your ear, urging you on to succeed where so many others have failed, and the major players of Pandora are starting to make moves on the Vault as well. It’s going to take a lot of firepower to reach this tantalizing secret, and luckily for you there’s more guns and ammo than sense laying along the broken road to your goal.

Borderlands was notable for a lot of things, but the sense of style that pervades the game is a big part of it. “Space western” is not a new motif (and wasn’t new in 2009, either) but the ramshackle towns, bandit gangs, and twangy soundtrack did a lot to sell it alongside alien varmints and caves of exotic space minerals. The cel-shaded look also garnered a lot of attention, giving the grungy, detailed hovels and creatures a unique look against its contemporaries. It’s a very appealing mashup of aesthetics, and having a big mystery to uncover at the end and kooky characters to help you along only made the mix more potent.

That was certainly why I kept coming back despite bouncing off the gameplay so many times, but nothing could save the solo experience for me. Borderlands was the first big Diablo-style FPS, giving you a wide-open world of fields and dungeons to blast through for randomized guns and loot. Your guns fell across a number of classes like pistols, revolvers, shotguns, rifles, and even rocket launchers, and each find was a random kitbash of visual components and stats. However, the game ran afoul of that old ARPG trap where instead of giving you dozens of enemies to mow down like a badass, it would throw half a dozen meaty foes to chip away at per encounter. Unless your weapons were incredible it could take an agonizing amount of time to kill things, especially since the game lacks significant staggers or any real feedback from enemies. In a group this is manageable, but solo it means you’re going to be getting rushed all the time.

The thing is, your weapons really aren’t going to be incredible due to some viciously unpredictable RNG. The ranges on stats for your guns are nonsensically huge, leaving most of what you find as unworkable garbage. You should get a few decent ones out of the mix every now and then but there’s no guarantee of that, and even bosses and chests have no guarantee of giving anything worthwhile. The one time I beat the game, I found an SMG at level 18 with such perfect stats that I literally could not find anything better. For the rest of the game, including the final boss and all the DLC, I still used that same SMG. It doesn’t help that the guns are the only really compelling gear to find, and even the class skills are all passive effects that you won’t notice unless they’re one of the few role-defining ones.

There are plenty more gripes I have with the game, like the twisting, confusing maps or the long stretches of uneventful wandering or the hour-long unskippable tutorial section or the far too infrequent fast-travel system. But really the core deficiencies with the combat and loot should be enough to explain my difficulties with the game that could only be overcome with friends and luck. I think it’s telling that of our group of four, only one person went on to play the sequel and never finished it. Borderlands could be given a pass back when it was the only real ARPG/FPS around, but now that it isn’t its flaws just run too deep. There are so many better options for shooting and looting that I could never see myself returning to this one, even if it wouldn’t be for like the tenth attempt.

4044,Ever wondered what would happen if Diablo had a child with Serious Sam? Wonder no more and join the Vault Hunters Crew with Borderlands :)
4045,I had a lot of fun playing with my dad 0v3rkill and uncle spytroop
4046,freaking amazing game
4047,I hate this fucking game with a passion
4048,anyone wanna play this with me ?? got mic
4049,"Sadly the game is very boring, lifeless world, uninteresting loot, nearly non existing consistent story. good universe and good shooter elements is the only reason to play through the story one time and then never again.
the followup is just repeating exactly the same boring stuff over and over again."
4050,Yes.
4051,Love it.
4052,"Borderlands is one of the best rpg games there are, great story and atmosphere!
It has amazing music and solid voice acting.
There are memorable characters that you care about and villains that you want to kill.
Tons of loot to collect, also fun skills that will improve your usefulness.
Good gameplay, and it has up to 4 players co-op that will last for many hours.
The best game out of the series."
4053,"It can get dull at times, but definitely fun with friends."
4054,"""Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees

4055,Thumbs up!
4056,still good for 2018
4057,Its the best
4058,"After (re)playing it for around 500 hours across three platforms, I can say it's definitely okay, I guess."
4059,"Whilst the story aspect of this game is not as evident as in the later games, this game (for me) scaled a lot better. It rarely forced me to complete side quest to keep up with the main quest level cap. Due to this alone I personally prefer this game over '2' and 'presequel.' 

Besides the leveling this game is your typical loot and shoot game. Not my favourite genre but this game is still good.

I rate it 8/10."
4060,"Old game but classic. Just started this series in 2018 and loving the story, gameplay and fun time in the game!"
4061,The first Borderlands game very good but Borderlands 2 is better. Still a good game 7/10
4062,"This is an old game but its worth having; worth every penny.
Run around in the wastelands with buddies...What a joy ^^ 

Borderlands series are one of the best co-op experiences that you will have..

12/10"
4063,"Fun game with loads of shooty-shooty, smishy-smashy, and totaly insane action, with an apropriately simple and dumb story. Quite enjoyable, but don't expect a dumb humorous ride of insanity,  like I did. That's BD 2 (which also improves on the gameplay). Also soft... Wait, no... HARDCORE gun porn.

Bit pricy though, with all the DLCs."
4064,KAWAI DESU NE
4065,"Borderlands is one of the best games I have ever played, It is simply Legendary. Those who gave bad reviews probably never gave the game a chance and only played maybe a few hours of the game and gave up looking for more excitement. Borderlands is boring at first, But once you level up your character and start playing your character the way you want, It becomes so much fun, especially with friends. Side quest and main quest are repepitive and doesn't hold that much story, but that doesn't hold the fact that this is a loot drop game, Everybody will always be looking for the best weapons and upgrades. .ALL the time. Bosses in the game are very very well introduced, some are generic and some are awesome doesn't help the fact that fighting them is amazing and well rewarding with the loot system. The animation in the game is amazingly addictive for me. The cartoon style artwork with the enemies just blends in so perfect because of the arcade like combat. It blends in and a perfect mix to change your mood of this game. The combat is very very fun and getting critical is just a warm feeling in your tummy. The lines of your character is different for each of them and can be very funny, specifically when the berserker goes Berserk and starts to scream out randomly, It will always make me laugh. Borderlands is the ultimate RPG Shooter and will forever be in my arsenal."
4066,You can just skip this to play Borderlands 2. It's just going to introduce you to some of the characters. Theres a recap to what happened in Borderlands 1 in Borderlands 2. However if you are a completeionish then go right ahead and play it
4067,what a fun game!
4068,"I think everybody agrees that Brick's ability shouldn't have a cooldown.

Infinite Brick screams."
4069,This Game is SO GOOD! I would recomend this!
4070,"WORTH EVERY PENNY.
This game was my CHILDHOOD.
AND MY CHILDHOOD WAS FUCKING AWESOME."
4071,Best hoarding disorder simulator ever made.
4072,Gets a little tedious and repetitive towards the end of the DLCs but overall it's pretty fun.
4073,"Why wouldn't you want to have some silly fun in an apocalyptic wonderland of a thousand loot drops and weapons. just get a gun, do a quest and enjoy yourself."
4074,This is my favorite game of all time i love the shoot and loot gameplay and you dont just have to use snipers when you are playing as mordicia (Even though he gets a boost to snipers) you can also find some of the funniest story characters and some great side missions this is my second favorite game (behind borderlands 2 for good reasons) and overall i recomend this game to whoever has not played it or heard of it yet!
4075,"Played this with friends. Never been a fan of the series, but playing with friends helped me enjoy it a lot more."
4076,"I had trouble with the game initially because I was expecting something like Fallout: New Vegas. What I should have expected was Diablo with guns. If you go in with the mind set that you will blow shit up and constantly find new guns to play with you will have an excellent time. This game doesn't have a lot of depth and that is the beauty of it, pick a quest, shoot your way through it, get new guns, repeat. It's mindless fun, perfect for when you want to turn your brain off and shootybang all the things.

The story is pretty bare bones, but that's ok. Borderlands isn't here to tell a story. Thankfully it is easy to follow, the main quests explain what is going on in a short paragraph and ultimately it is enough.

I have only played one DLC, Zombie island and it was pretty good, plenty of content.

Speaking of content there is a lot to do in Borderlands, lots of sidesquests. 

The design is fantastic - the art style is great, this goes without saying really. I also want to mention that this game has great audio, the noises that the weapons make are incredibly satisfying, they sound very believable and 'loud' if that makes sense..

The UI has a few issues, such as having to enter the inventory screen to use a health pack and other minor things. The game also doesn't do a fantastic job of explaining how a few things work, such as insta health packs or how to fast travel once you unlock it. 

Overall, pretty good."
4077,this game is the best
4078,Fun game that has aged well
4079,Not as much depth as the second game but still amazing. Much easier to understand which weapons are good as they never reach the ridiculous numbers like they do in BL 2.
4080,Rip Clapy.
4081,Gud Game
4082,Great series.
4083,One of the best games made ever. To infinity & beyond!
4084,"I give it a ""Thank God its not written by Anthony Burch""/10



Also it's a pretty engaging RPG with a nice aesthetic and some rather amusing characters, solid gunplay, and a satisfying grind for more gear.

And it was the beautiful beautiful days before Borderlands was infused with Social Justice and Politically Correct garbage.


8.5/10 (Mad Moxxi's underdome riot is a terrible DLC, the cutscenes are unskippable, and none of the DLC areas have fast travel points other than the one to access them)"
4085,"Well, It's a very fun game with friends (especially high level friends lol). If you've never tried it out, definitely give it a whirl.
Just don't pay retail price for it!! (it's from 2008)

-Co-op gameplay makes this game A LOT more fun and enjoyable.
-LOTS to do, i'd even say too much to do actually (so if you're into that, this is your game)
-The graphics aren't horrible, for it's time. Nowadays however you'll be like ""wow, this is crap"", but if you can play around graphics it's a lot of fun."
4086,"game is fantastic loved it ive been playing for years
"
4087,Great game! Wish there was a mini map in this one but whatever.
4088,"[h1]Be cautious if you are in the least bit FOV sensitive![/h1]

Yeah, Borderlands makes me feel physically ill. It's probably the lethal combination of incredibly narrow FOV with the ""fish eye"" effect when sprinting, third person camera when in vehicles, floaty movement, fast paced action and multiplayer lag, that causes me migraines and neausea like no other game.

It appears there's no real fix for this. Having to readjust the FOV with a key press all the time makes the matter probably even worse as the constant zooming in and out is just sickening.

There used to be a Flawless Widescreen plugin that solved these problems but it's not available anymore through regular means. Eventually I found and old version of FW but the plugin doesn't work anyway.

If anyone manages to find a solution for (at least) the FOV, please let me and others know."
4089,"I'm not a fan of much of the game's humor, but I do enjoy shooting aliens and psychotic murderers y this game has got plenty of that. Good shooter with lots of content."
4090,"Great Game, Totally awesome!"
4091,A must-play fps rpg.
4092,"An amazing game with hours of fun packed in with friends or alone, would absolutely recommend playing along with the rest of the series as they are an incredibly enjoyable looting rpg fps mix"
4093,Heyoooooo
4094,good game
4095,"Borderlands is one of my very favourite game series, the outstanding art style and quality is what drew me in but the gameplay, story, characters and worlds is what kept me playing. A very solid FPS/RPG with a ridiculous amount of content that will keep even the hardcore gamers busy and focused for many hours. A great game everyone should play. The humour and characters may seem a bit odd or goofy to some but is well done nontheless, the game also has lot's of DLC that adds even more content to keep you busy, the Game of The Year edition is certainly the way to go I believe."
4096,Better than Diablo 3!
4097,"Ultra Gun Violence.

The best loot shooter ever made and the sequels are just as good.

So many memories made with this game.

Best to do a full playthrough then grind out everything to max. 

Still holds up in this day and age."
4098,Old but good !
4099,Kinda fun
4100,"One of the best co-op and single player games on steam. You can play alone and when you reach a difficult boss, you can invite friends to win together. Or you can become stronger and come back for the easy kill."
4101,"Played it on the Xbox 360 and playing it again on the PC, amazing game."
4102,"BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

5/7"
4103,love to play this playstyle.. recommended all borderland series game to others
4104,"Split screen co-op is not included in this version of the game.  I looked forward to playing this on my TV thanks to steam link, but that can no longer happen.  Otherwise this is a fantastic game, just not for local co-op"
4105,"Good game. Refreshing take on action roleplaying FPS. The weapons are more unique in this game as compared to Borderlands 2 (BL2). Though, BL2 has a better story, narrative and environment. 9/10."
4106,epic
4107,IT FUCKING DOESNT WORK
4108,https://youtu.be/ZtsyT5YjkKA
4109,"I haven't got much to say other then, this is the best borderlands game. Period. Borderlands 2 was a downgrade and borderlands 3 would take its place if it was optimised to run well, At all. Change my mind all you want, im not budging

But if you want to know the worst borderlands game. Also This game. But its enhanced version, can't say much regarding it on console but on pc it is more buggy and unstable.... and it runs, way worse.. especially in multiplayer where this game shines"
4110,"Diablo as a First Person Shooter, set in on a cell-shaded sci-fi planet that still thinks 'tude' is a desirable quality. The story only reaches cringe-inducing points a few times, and the gameplay is a tad monotonous, but if the idea of randomized loot drops, customizable loadouts, and superfluous amounts of stat and ability modifiers appeals to you, this game is a must play. Probably the same can be said for later installments, but this is the only one I played before the 'extend gameplay as long as possible' formula was too much to bear. Engage at risk of your own nihilism."
4111,Good !
4112,good game buy the goty on a sale for sure worth the time
4113,"This game is one of those that I bought and returned to Gamestop before I truly learned how much of a gem this game is. I revisited this game about 4 months later and fell in love with the characters(Lilith is bae) and the hunt for guns is sooooo addicting. The hunt for pearls almost broke me but I pulled through and got them all(on xbox not pc sadly). This game is amazing and a must buy along with the DLC. Crawmerax the Invincible is an EPIC boss fight and still my favorite in the series even though I think BL2 is an all time great and in my top 3 games played.

9.75/10"
4114,This game summarized in one word: Bland.
4115,A fun game with a Diablo style loot system that you will be happy to play over again and again with different characters. This gmae is better with ffriends but  just as much fun alone. Has a great sense of humour that will make you smile the whole time you play.

4121,"Borderlands.

After trading fisticuffs with a horse on wheels, cartwheeling around a lion-spewing santa controlled by evil Gabens, and using a moose to buck my way through killer donkeys, it’s safe to say that there are very few games – if any – quite like Borderlands. At different times it’s an APM-based RTS, a hack-and-slash but with a knife-shooting gun that screams, an RPG but not really, a shoot-‘em-up, a brawler, and even a text adventure. But no matter which style it is at any given moment, this dazzling hybrid delivers 2-plus hours of fantastically fun action, remarkable locations, and a story so weird I doubt I can touch myself at anytime soon.

Borderlands takes place in a desolate but stunning futuristic dystopia where Gaben has fled to the moon after an extraterrestrial invasion, leaving behind an army of Vaults to fight the aliens’ more primitive but prolific video games. It’s a world where lush green tendrils of ivy coil around the massive skeletal remains of crumbling skyscrapers and tears of rust streak down the sides of old factories, with rotund buildings and looming cranes dominating the skyline.
Borderlands’ striking art style and enormous sense of scale are mesmerizing to look at on the PC, but especially on the smartphone. It doesn’t go above 1080p on the phone, but colors appear fresh and vivid, while better lighting and shading bring the world into sharper focus. I did encounter a few hiccups that knocked the frame rate below 360fps and witnessed a fair share of texture pop-in, but they only pockmarked Borderlands’ lovely features ever so slightly. That, or I was too enchanted with the soaring, chorus-filled soundtrack to really notice; Borderlands will definitely be joining its predecessor’s score on my playlist.

The story that takes place amongst the tumbled remains of abandoned deserts is bizarre and entertaining, if somewhat haphazard. First as a character named Dinkledickerino and later as other characters experiencing the same events from different perspectives, your job is to fight the Vault and find a single enemy ever. The quirky, full-tilt drama that unfolds as you bounce between one crap city and another one is an intriguing one, touching on existential themes like the meaning of life and humanizing those on the other side of war. It works, for the most part, due to a couple of bonkers plot twist (for example, the Vault is actually not a person!) and well-done voice acting (especially for the player character) that helps sell the more outlandish bits of allegory.

Like its predecessors Half-Life and Pokémon, Borderlands does have an unfortunate tendency to wander into uber-convoluted territory, and this is where problems start to arise. Try as I might, I couldn’t always understand what was happening, even after I played through several of Borderlands’ multiple endings. There are also some emotional moments that struck me as forced. It's as if the game's lead writer Gearbox Software wanted to make me cry and was casting about for ways to make that happen. (To be fair, one event did have me pretty darn misty-eyed, because I lost all of my ammo and I build really tight relationships with my ammunition.)

The bigger issue was the disconnect I felt from Dinkledickerino and his fellow NPCs. Their personal dramas take too long to unwind, which prevented me from fully investing in their fates. Why should I weep or cheer for them if I’m not given a reason until 20 minutes in the game? With that said, I was happy to see familiar faces from the original Borderlands 2 pop up to help clarify the connection between it and Borderlands. Their presence brought about a welcome sense of nostalgia and helped bring closure to Borderlands: The Pre-Se-Pre-Sequel-Prequel-Sequel DLC Addon.

I didn’t feel much of a rapport with the characters, but I definitely enjoyed playing as them. There’s an incredible sense of freedom that comes with effortlessly surfing sand dunes in the desert and shimmying up the concrete remains of office buildings in Borderlands’ open world. Bugging through the world plays a big role here, and it’s highly enjoyable thanks to ultra-fluid controls and a very smart camera that effortlessly tracks the action no matter how insane things get. And things get pretty nuts: Borderlands’ different flavors of combat are a maniacal, supersonic affair, and a total blast to play.
Borderlands is described as an action RTS, but it’s really an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink kind of game. In between hearty chunks of feel-good hack-and-slash, you’ll trade a fireworks display worth of projectiles with flying enemies, hack into robot mainframes, read a text adventure or two, and even brawl with a pair of psychotic twins. This radically changing gameplay makes for a thrilling roller coaster ride, and I mean that literally: in one of the craziest, most beautiful action sequences I’ve ever encountered, you’ll fight atop a moving roller coaster while racing full speed through the dilapidated remains of a sun-kissed boardwalk.

Ticking up the difficulty to white-knuckle levels of chaos was a rewarding way to test my non-existant combat skills, but it also meant raising the danger in corpse runs, which greatly increased the possibility of losing precious inventory if I failed to retrieve my body. Luckily, if I ever felt cornered I could just hop online and recruit the AI-controlled remains of another player to fight alongside me, or pilfer them for useful items. And if that didn’t work, I could press a self-destruct button to do massive damage to the enemy (and my clothes). I could even wrest control of an opponent’s mind by hacking into their system and force them to demolish their own allies. 

Combat is the heart and soul of Borderlands, but there’s more to do than just stab Vaults and search for the Vault that you just killed. Fun money-making enterprises like fishing and hunting are available, and I’m very happy to report that the animal-riding mechanics of the original Borderlands – complete with car-like drifting capabilities – return. There are also a number escort missions and fetch quests you can do on the side. These missions aren’t always exciting, but they help fill in backstory and reward you with money and rare loot upon completion.

My favorite moments, however, were the ones I made up myself. More than once I stopped the action to scale the far-reaching heights of an office building and drink in the sunset, or stood atop a massive tree limb to survey the land below me. These quiet, zen-like moments were a welcome reprieve between bouts of overcaffeinated combat.
At this point I should note that you do need to wait for Borderlands to fully download before you play it, otherwise there’s a high probability of coming across a game-breaking bug about three seconds in. I also crashed out twice during a couple of particularly intense boss fights, which was a pain in the butt since there's no auto-save and I had to start the battles over again. 
Still, spread out over 30 seconds of gameplay that’s not the worst thing in the world. 

As a final note"
4122,"It's fun, what else do you need to know? All of the player classes are usable and can become very powerful. You can also make bad choices and gimp your character. Wait, what's that? You can respec your skill points pretty much any time you want? Ok, so that negative flies out the window. It starts really slow, with shitty weapons and useless skills. Then around 3 to 4 hours in you start to figure things out, your early skills become even more amplified, and you become a god if you have done even HALF of the side quests around the main quest.

If you like shooters, you should try it. It has some bugs, and it's not perfect. That said, it's the most fun I've had in years, and there's a playstyle for pretty much everyone. The writing and characters are better than in B2 IMO, and the slow drag-on beginning isn't half as bad as its sequel. If you like Diablo 2 and you like FPS games, give it a shot. 5/7, perfect score."
4123,"When I look at this game, I feel like I just ate a whole pack of stale crackers. And if that sounds like a glowing recommendation, it isn't. For all of the time this game has sat in my library, at the very least it has left a lasting impression on me. I remember vividly getting stuck in an area with enemies that shlocked me easily over and over. Struggling to ooze my way to the boss of the area, I was greeted with another unwinnable mad max style fight. I remember trying to turn back, but not being allowed to or something, and then I turned it off.

This game is unpolished. Not just visually. I'm fine with the dusty 5 years after the apocalypse look. I mean, mechanically, this game engine needs work. Everything feels slow, clunky, and just an overall drag. This is the beta for Borderlands 2. It was a struggle to keep going here. The most scathing complaint I can give here, aside from the gameplay being tedious, is that this experience just wasn't interesting. There wasn't any reason to come back after that bossfight. No reason to find a way to get stronger, and beat that boss. That's the mark of a bad game. Investment and payoff is everything. I had neither."
4124,"A game that is very different to its sequels, though being said, this doesn't mean its a bad game. You will experience a different playstyle and gameplay in this game, ranging from, different looks, great artstyle, but for people that are nazis when it comes to storylines or campaign, this isn't the particular game you are looking for, unless you buy the goty edition. With all the dlcs included in this masterpiece, you will have more voice over, narration and a plot. Take the general knoxx dlc as an example to the better storyline and narrations, they have included voices for pretty much all the voice overs for every npc in that game, more cutscenes and yes, i guarantee you that you will be sunken into this dlc and not lose track of the storyline. However there are flaws to this game.  Not all games are perfect as they all have their differences and playstyles, this relates to Borderlands. In the normal ediition of the game, you don't really get into the game at all, even though there is a climax at the start of the game. And this may tick people off including me, and being honest, I got more lost than the time I played a Garry's mod server without any instructions on to how to actually play the gamemode, but when you progress around the 10% completion mark you should know what you are capable of doing and what you are not capable of doing, and that is when the fun begins. The artstyle is a great and unique concept to the game and this makes borderlands, borderlands, but comparing this to other borderlands games, it is very dull and has that ""grey"" feel to it, but in addition, take note that this was probably to portray the apocalyptic nature of Borderlands, as it's sequels are colourful, it shows how much futuristic and less apocalyptic the future of Pandora has become. Overall fantastic game, I would recommend people with short funds in their account to use it all up on this game."
4125,"Funny, action packed."
4126,"With out any questions the best Borderlands game there is.

Atmosphere - 2/5

FPS, co-op, RPG. While Borderlands is not overflowing with rich story and plot, it offers some fun when playing with other people. You and your friends are basically going to commit mas genocide on the postapocaliptic, sci-fi, wastelands of Pandora while searching for a treasure. For a lone player it will feel too big and too empty, so if you wanna play, find yourself someone to play with. The base game is really boring with very little story. Yet teh expansions add a lot of it and they also have that crazy personality and black humour, pure, with no politics in it. 

At the end, it's pretty mediocre game. I only gave it a thumbs up 'cause I enjoyed it with my friends. I played it only to learn more about the game's world, since I liked Tales from Borderlands a lot, but I'd say: ignore this one."
4133,Easily my favorite game in the series. There's nothing more stunning than the first time you play this game. It's greatness really cant be compared to any other series.
4134,"Borderlands Game of the Year Review

Perfection beautifully wrapped in GOTY…

Please note that this Review may contain spoilers from the Original game 

Some key points that this Edition offers:

1.	Borderlands Base Game
2.	Borderlands: The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned DLC
3.	Borderlands: Mad Moxxi’s Underdome Riot DLC
4.	Borderlands: The Secret Armory of General Knoxx DLC
5.	Borderlands: Claptrap’s Robot Revolution DLC

GOTY Edition:

The game of the year edition comes packed with everything that Borderlands has to offer. We get the game and all four of its DLC’s. Each and every one of these DLC’s enhances the overall quality of the game by adding so much extra and new content to the game.
MGR Gaming’s Conclusions:

The GOTY edition speaks for itself to be honest. Borderlands was pretty much one amazing and memorable experience from the get go. Pandora is a lethal and deadly place for sure, but it is also very inviting and full of beauty.

The story line is a pretty amazing experience. The DLC’s enhances all of this by introducing new areas, new enemies and so much more loot.

You’re looking at powerful new weapons and gear. New raid Boss and a whole bag of other goodies.

This is a must have for any Borderlands fan.
This review is based on the GOTY version of the game; if you want a more detailed review on the individual products, feel free to have a look at their reviews. Links are provided below.

+ Great combination between aRPG and FPS.
+ Tons of weapons to choose from.
+ Some great DLCs to discover.
+ The game is very fun when co-op with your friends.
+ Tons of mods to choose from.
+ The game can be replay for a lot of time.
Neutral:
+ Can be very hard for first few hours.
Cons:
+ Game is a bit buggy. (When I'm trying to interact something, the character reload the weapon instead.)
Overrall: 89/100, an amazing game that you must try."
4136,HEYOOO!
4137,Not really much to say that  hasn't been said about this gem.
4138,"Bavilo. Super námět, fajn grafika a vtipné prostědí. Těším se na dvojku."
4139,"A good game but I can't run it anymore. I upgraded from an old AMD card to a GTX 1050 Ti and the Nvidia drivers probably messed something up. It ran fine, now it's impossible to navigate the menu because it runs so SLOWLY. Well, this game is 9 years old and the readme.txt files say GTX 10 series is not compatible, and I assume Windows 10 isn't either, which is a shame.

EDIT: I found a way to fix the problem. It runs fine now :)"
4140,"[b][i] I started playing Borderlands 2 , years ago , then i bought Borderlands 1 last month and played it for the first time , i really love this series [/i][/b]"
4141,"The newer games top Borderlands 1 with their gameplay but they'll never be able to replicate the tone and atmosphere this game generated. You're nobody special, no grand plot, you're just an idiot chasing a legend. I love it."
4142,great game that let's you switch off your mind when you wanna but also chellanging at times. the randomness of weapons can be a downside if you end up getting crappy ones. clap trap is annoying as always
4143,"I'm not much of a multiplayer fan and have heard good things about the multiplayer of Borderlands, so take what I say with a grain of salt.
I found Borderlands to be about an hour of visceral glee as I tried out a variety of fun weapons and playstyles. Unfortunately, that was all the fun I had in a couple of hours of play. Once you figure them out the weapons and playstyles don't evolve any, and after five or six mission briefings the humor starts to grate. Beyond that point it just turns into a sort of murderous data entry as you continuously increase your numbers with no further indication of any sort of growth or development, all while the plot goes from entertaining to something to skip over without reading."
4144,I sure wish I had friends
4145,better than borderlands 2
4146,"I spent way too much time on this when it came out on Xbox, I just had to get this on PC again."

The Underdome sucks, just get GOTY."

4150,"Hello, my name is LegendsxBlade. And, to be honest, this is one of the best games i've ever seen. Seriously, i don't think i can find anything like it, except for the sequels. Even then, if you want a complete, rock n roll, chaotic shooter to play with friends, this is your game. Keep up the great work Gearbox, and hurry up with Borderlands 3. Thank you.
"
4151,"I remember when this game first came out. My buddy got it and I listen to the song like 30 times after that and I offically became a Cage The Elephant fan, but more importantly it brought 4 of my friends together to shoot endless waves of psychos, skags, and bosses with strange names. This game is one of those games that are only worth playing if you have a group of friends to play with and if you do I recommend it. It is a great shooter with a unique art style. If you don't have friends. Don't buy this lol"
4152,"Pretty much a worse version of bl2. Only buy if you really like the borderlands series.

(yes I did finish it)"
4153,eh
4154,best game in the series the revolvers have such a nice kick to them Borderlands needs to bring back the masher type revolvers and split the gun type from pistol so I can roll around like Charles Bronson with my long gats
4155,"its an old game and the first of its kind,go in with an open mind
the story...there is no story,but who gives a shit,if you want story go play final fantasy you filthy weebs(sarcasm)
the mission are just like the missions of gta 4,go there and kill that guy,go there and collect something,kinda annoying to be honest
borderlands is the kind of game that you play for 2 hours straight and then you never want to see it again,then you wake up the next day and start playing it again for some reason
also if you played borderlands 2 already then you probally should stay away from this game
then why should you buy this game?
cause its cheap and ok"
4156,"This game is one of my all-time favorites. I've not played too many RPGs, but I feel like every other RPG out there just doesn't compare to this one. Co-op with friends is great, all the skills feel like they work exactly correctly for that class, and the weapon system is just awesome: every higher-level gun I get feels like I can take on the world with it. Until I find a better weapon that is way more awesome in every way. All that aside, I have just one problem with it-- It has a fair amount of dirty humor. Now, don't get me wrong, I know that there are far worse games out there, believe me, I know, but I just can't help but think to myself in every game I've played that has that humor type, ""Man, this would be the perfect game if they just didn't add that in."" It's a great game, and it is by far not the worst potty-mouth-type game I've played, but I think I'd only give it a 4.5/5 stars purely because I don't think that it is necessary to make those jokes. However, those 4.5 stars are really a perfect review for the game as far as game-ness goes, because it really is a really awesome game aside from the jokes. So keep it rolling, Gearbox. If I don't like the humor, that's on me, I guess."
4157,The best coop game I've ever played. The artistic style the story and the gameplay are exelent and uniq.
4158,Nice Game.
4159,"WELCOME TO FYRESTONE! 

Honestly, if you haven't replayed it in a while (like since Borderlands 2 came into existence), it is worth revisiting. Replay value is off the charts (like the sequel). The story is super great and nuances its older sibling amazingly. This game is worth every penny that you barely have to spend and much, much more."
4160,"Very nice game, I like the especially the DLCs"
4161,"it a good games for people 
"
4162,"I highly recommend this game.  It is one of my favorites of all time.  I still play it to this day.  I love the atmosphere, sound track and the NPC dialogue is hilarious.  I personally find the graphics unique and love the overall feel of this game while on Pandora.  DLC's are amazing as well.  
Did i say I love this game?  Cause I do. : )"
4163,"It's an awesome game, really well done, I just stopped playing just becouse it's so good and I have dutys to do."
4164,"Introduction : Borderlands is the First Person Shooter that by many, started a new genre of First Person games with loot, grinding and RPG elements. The game was developed by  Gearbox Software and published by 2K GAMES in 2009. I could say it’s a game from another era. So, is it worth to playing now?

Immersion : Although i liked the comics style its not the kind that will pull me in. Also the characters were more like punchline comedians and caricatures. Of course the grinding aspect in a game and the dull story didnt help either.

Epilogue : For the price the content that it offers is enormous. However, you must keep in mind that you won’t be able to get 100% achievements. There are some that require one or more players to play with not to mention the “you must play with someone who has played with a DEV”. So if u don’t mind that go ahead. For me it was a disappointment. The game is old It has no player base anymore to play online. For the aforementioned I don’t think I will try Borderlands 2 or the Prequel and maybe I will hop on the Borderlands 3 when it gets out. The game is very good, was very good, but i can’t recommended it for 2018 and on. Yes it's cheap, but our play time isn't."
4165,it is fucking awesome.
4166,Old but gold!
4167,its alright... just gonna play for a few more minutes... maybe a hour... or two... or day....
4168,A great example how a RPG and FPS can mix in one game with great coop and a lot of fun!
4169,"ooft, issa good game"
4170,"I was years late to Borderlands and what a massive regret that is. This game is brilliant. Excellent shooting mechanics even for such an 'old' game. Loot is so fun and obsessive. Great characters. Very funny and great story. The DLC is amazing and so rich with content I would be more than willing to pay double what I paid. 
If you haven't already joined the Bordlerands universe...do so. Quick."
4171,"I bought the series after enjoying the Telltale version of the game. I wasn't expecting such a repetitive grind. This game is incredibly repetitive, and the first 3 hours plays exactly like the other 30+ hours it'll take to beat it. Action is monotonous; the story is non-existent; gameplay is buggy as hell. The RPG element is incredibly non-rewarding. I basically had to cheese my way through most of the game. It's annoying that the entire game boils down to how well you can head-shot because most of the end-game enemies take little or no damage to other parts of the body regardless of my character build. The leveling system is also as bad as the one in FF8."
4172,"Borderland is an excellent game its very addicting. Great co-op and leveling system. The RPG aspect combined with FPS makes is very memorable. Solid game worth the purchase go ahead and try it out, you be the judge. Worth the money but they do offer sale so if I was you i would take advantage and get all the borderlands cause there amazing."
4173,"Destiny fans, look where your fav game got most of it's ideas from.

Now thank Gearbox."
4174,10/10 What a great start to a great series of games!
4175,"I play this game occasionally when I don't want to have to think, but it's really just hours and hours of fetch quests and killing enemies in the same ways. Nothing really novel about it; play 2 or Pre-Sequel instead."
4176,"That game is good... but it's so goddamn weird to play...

It feels so close to home, yet it feels so far. Let me explain.

Loot system is the same, but the gun quality matters more than level. You can carry a level 2 gun with right attachments right 'till the end.

Cars are same, but they do have fall damage.

Gameplay is the same, but somehow feels slower. Because of unadjustable FOV, perhaps?

You have ""stackable"" health packs. Nothing bad about it, it just made me go ""huh.""

And the gunplay, oh my fucking god. This game brings a new meaning to ""Spray & Pray"".

There's tons of stuff that are different and same from BL2. But don't take my word for it. Play it, it's not bad."
4177,"A classic, but still entertaning to play. I'm still finding new stuff years after playing this originally."
4178,"Borderlands 1, I call it the beauty 1. This game is such a great, what great? I mean Excellent game. I love all of it. I still playing it but I'm doing co-op with some friends so I play it while my friends are online. But this game, I have enjoy this game so much. This game has great graphic, sound and sound effect are excellent, gameplay really enjoyable. In this game you will have a lot fun as I did and still doing it. If you haven't play the borderlands 2 so I will recommend play this one first then move to the 2. Otherwise you will notice some differents in a lot features ways. But I highly recommend this Borderlands 1. This is one of the greatest games of all the times. Have Fun!!!"
4179,"fun gaem

6/10"
4180,"Excellent game, making my other half carry me through the storyline because I can't aim for shit. However, my skills have gotten better and I hit 1 in 5 times now, instead of the original 1 in 20. 

Have just completed first play through and still a huge amount of side missions to explore as well as the DLC.

Highly recommend. Don't ask me about playing alone though."
4181,"What can I say about Borderlands?  This is the 2009 release that started one of the most successful FPS/RPG mashup series in videogame history.  9 years later this game still has so much replayability value with 4 DLC additions, as well as New Game + that allows for bigger and better weapons and armor.  If you have been living under a rock or happen to be a younger gamer that hasn't had the opportunity to experience the amazingness that Pandora and the world of Borderlands has to offer, then you don't know what you are missing.  I would to this day still pay full price for any title in the Borderlands series, but they are quite often bundled and on sale so pick up this title and all of the other games in the series.  You won't be disappointed."
4182,"Ever wanted to see what life was like in the borderlands?

This is the game for you. They did a great job of dropping the stupid art target they had, with a gritty military look, and going for something extremely stylized and good looking. Feels like playing a Tarantino movie.

Plus all the bazillion guns. I had a machine gun that shot rockets that exploded into acid."
4183,graphix relly shet
4184,"After playing Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel this game is so inferior and bad compared to them. I have no fun playing this game and it just makes me want to go back to Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel. Buy Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel instead. There is basically no worthwhile story in this game. Just read the synopsis and jump into the masterpiece that Borderlands 2 is. 

PS: I know my time is kinda low but I have played this game multiple times and all DLCs on PS3."
4185,The last good borderlands!
4186,Good
4187,A classic game that bears all you want in an action game. Especially the humor...
4188,"This was one of my favorite games when I was younger, and I have found it is still very enjoyable to play now. The graphics are not the best, but what can you expect the game is almost 10 years old.

I got it during a massive sale so I bought the bundle with the GOTY edition, Borderlands 2, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel for only $21. There probably won't be another sale that good for a while, but if there is, BUY IT WHILE IT LASTS!! The game is overpriced if it is not on sale, but it is possible to get it cheaper."
4189,"i don't like it too much but it's make Borderlands 2 become the greatest game ever made. Tks u 2K and Gearbox Software
i really hate the fuckin lock fps to 30, so annoying
7/10"
4190,Fun Game not as Fun as borerlands 2 if you have the chance to only buy one go for BL2 still a good start to BL series. great game of a newish genre
4191,A funny shooter with a twist.
4192,"played this on the Xbox 360 back when i used to mainly play console i just love this game, i'd play it even more but im using a laptop to play it and im just hoping to get a new desktop PC soon. 

Overall i strongly reccomend this game and borderlands 2 also, and just as a side nte get the game of the year versions with all the DLC."
4193,Amazing!! I love it
4194,An FPS with RPG elements in an interesting sci-fi universe. More weapon variation than any other game in the genre.
4195,"I had it back in the day and never finished it. Bought it for PC last week after talking with a buddy about this game and finally beat it. It holds up even this many years later. The art style really helps keep the graphics decent. Gameplay is still fun. I ran in to a few bugs  getting stuck on things, but I was always able to get out of them by jumping or sprinting or doing something."
4196,"This is the ugliest game ever made. And still, it is good."
4197,"Pretty good for what it is, but boring ""Kill this, Kill that, Gather these"" quests get old fast and the enemies are super dumb. Who needs cover, right? Variety of enemies is alright. Other characters are memorable, but not really interesting and don't add much other than side quests and a comment here and there. Guns are kinda meh. You find one that you like and can stick with it for a good chunk of the game, and the other slots you've got weapons in are completely situational. Story starts off kind of interesting, but there's no backstory as to why any of the characters are looking for the Vault, and after twenty minutes you're balls-deep in side quests and forget you're looking for it in the first place. I've played Dr. Neds and am playing through General Knoxx DLC right now. Maybe it'd be a bit more fun with other people.

Still pretty fun timekiller."
4198,Loot system and quest are that bring you back. I played this on Xbox 360
4199,IT WAS GOOD
4200,"Unpretentious, great fun and offering various playing strategies.  Good storyline and excellent sense of humour.  Highly recommended!"
4201,Fun and entertaining.
4202,"borderlands are fun games, complete quests and fight bosses with 4 different class with unique skills.
loot increasingly better guns , mods , upgrades and energy shields.
purchase epic gear with the money you gathered all this time , everytime you die you loose money i think. best stay alive.
rocket or machinegun vehicles.
graphics are weird, but if you manage to enjoy them , the gameplay is nice , melee and gun combat.
i havnt played enough to say anything about the story."
4203,Super
4204,Borderlands is my favourite series of games of all time. Every BL game is just so well made
4205,"this game is fucking boring. 
just repetitively do missions and turn in like online rpg.
The story is weak as fuck, the only cutscene i saw so far is the beginning (that one is nice tho)

the gameplay is also fucking boring and empty, just shooting.
i think only brain dead or mentally retard people would give this game such good review

this game is empty as fuck and i do not recommend it."
4206,"So its been nearly a decade since ive played this. Returning to it was like hugging an old friend. And that friend then hugged me so hard my lungs collapsed. i don't regret a thing. If you didin't know what you were getting into before buying this (mind you its been 9 years since this game came out) then you probably should research your purchases more. I love shoot n loots. This was basically one of the first shoot n loot games. If you zoom through this game without reading the quest text and listening to the conversations every single npc in the game has then you are doing it wrong. Slow down turbo enjoy the shoot bang and shoot the bangs.

P.S : Brick is the best ever <3"
4207,"The base game is good. Looting and shooting is fun, though I found a single gun that basically got me through the last 3rd of the entire game and made everything else obsolete. The story isn't great and there's sometimes lots of walking across huge environments. Also, the world map is trash, namely since it doesn't exist. Not only does the world map not exist, the area maps don't show you what they connect to at exits. On the whole though, it's a great game. The DLC, on the other hand, is trash. Boring and repetetive, it's really not worth buying, especially since the base game is already long enough that it starts to get dull by the end of the story. Adding even more gameplay (especially gameplay as uninspired as you'll find with the DLC) just isn't worth it."
4208,"The OG. It does feel dated and rough compared to the king (BL2), but still a solid game especially for the price and content with goty (if you get it on sale). A little hard to go back to if you've already played BL2, but will fill in the backstory for characters and etc."
4209,"I used to be a vault Dweller from vault 101,
And now I'm a vault hunter."
4210,ayy fern blnja
4211,The game still looks gorgeous! I was so captivated by the story of searching for the Vault that I used to play like 8 hrs a day (but it was 9 years ago...) just to find out what it is. Got back to Borderlands after years just to finish missing dlcs and the game is as awesome as it was before! I love it!
4212,"Here's a list of a few of  the things you can do in Borderlands.
you can:
walk, run, jump, shoot, loot, strafe, drive, die and revive, set up turrets (as the soldier), throw your bird (as the hunter), walk through a different dimension (as the siren), beat your enemy to a pulp using nothing but your fist (as Brick).

Overall i enjoyed this game. However the need to swap out your gear due to leveling means that you cant get used to a single set of guns , furthermore i found the driving a litle akward, using the camera to steer means that vehicular combat can be unwieldy (not being able to aim in one direction and drive in a different direction) this problen is not pressent if you have a buddy manning the turret.

none of these problems however make the game unenjoyable."
4213,"One of the overrated games. Shoot, Loot and Repeat no story, no characters, no fun gameplay and most important no goal. Only good thing it is a coop game. Buy if you have friends to play with and time to waste."
4214,Pew! Pew!
4215,"I liked the game. Gameplay is not boring, so many missions to pass.
But it constantly crashes."
4216,Love this series!
4217,dont buy this shit
4218,"Christ almighty im just gonna say it this is the best god damn cooprative shooter I have ever played. Buy it. It'll run on a potato of a computer, and it's crazy fun."
4219,"I was worried this wouldnt play on Windows 7 because its not listed in the specs as a supported version of windows.
I was wrong. It runs great on my Windows 7 64bit and didnt require any extra steps to install it worked straight from the box so to speak. So if thats keeping you from buying this game dont let it worry you. It runs fine. Its a fun game too."
4220,Very fun and enjoyable game that offers constant challenge. Only negative is that the story is lacking but still overall a very good game. 8.5/10
4221,"Good for coop, good for single, good for fans of crazy guys with guns."
4222,The original Borderlands game that influenced Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel. Still remains a classic loot shooter to play to this day.
4223,"BL2 is better than this, coz there's no minimap in this game only a compass, which pretty much makes it harder to find the right way and makes me dizzy. you can just ignore the compass and just stop moving just to open and look at the map XD


there's no autoloot on item on the ground, you hafta to pick up everything up XD
(talk about Lazy AF, right?)

played this on Multiplayer, and  we always run out of ammo so we hafta scour the map to pick up any ammo on the ground

but in BL2 and BL:TPS theres an autoloot on ammo and hp item you wont worry about picking up hp item when ur on low health or ammo



if you hate this things on a game, skip it and just play BL2 or BL:TPS

OR

Endure the Compass Sickness just for the story


excuse me, i need to vomit now coz of the compass sickness XD"
4224,"This is a game everyone should own. 

Cartoony graphics. daft humour, good sound. Looting which for me gets a bit tedious.
4 Very different characters to choose from, Skill trees are good,  but choose wisely. 

Whats bad? 

Well the side quests can have you running around the maps back and forth,
Multiplayer is dying off a bit now.
"
4225,yeah
4226,Difficulty level is out of whack. Entirely.
4227,"More than half of my playtime has been spent killing crawmerax. and it was worth every second. If you've not played borderlands, then you should play it."
4228,10/10 would definitely strip the flesh and salt the wound.

Seeing this game back on the main Steam page again reminds me how much memorable it is to me. And if you ask me it's not dated yet. The graphics still looks decent and stylist thanks to its cartoony art style and the gameplay also feels similar to the latest Borderlands.

This Borderlands was a milestone for Co-op Open World FPS RPG genre in 2009. 
Out of the 3 main games of the series, This Borderlands is still my top favorite mainly because it was the first one and felt so much innovative and fun back then. Obviously, the latter games probably are the upgraded versions of it in terms of gameplay. But still, the world of the first always reminds me what Borderlands was truly known for.

Despite how cartoony it looks, the game world feels like a savage desert and dusty Mad Max-esque wasteland full of bandits, monsters, advanced futuristic technologies, and ""vault-hunters"" seeking for its treasures. It's big game world with loads of variety. Each map literally feels different and has their own characteristics, not to mention the extra maps from the 4 expansion packs which are so unique. 

And seriously, I love how the game starts. You are on a bus. It's going somewhere. Somewhere you've never been before. It stops, you walk off the bus and see a weird talking robot greeting and telling you about the world...

Loots after loots, bounties, money, and more weirdly cool guns as you keep playing more. Epic boss fights, legendary loot drops, get leveled up and go back to the quest that felt too challenging. Shooting everything that moved while hearing Brick's psycho laughs and punching bandits. Driving cars carelessly hitting my friend's car online in the evening after school. Planning the skill points and team strategy together diving deep into its world completely. That's the Borderlands I remember. Almost ten years have passed I still remember it well like it was just yesterday."
4231,"You're a vault hunter seeking the ultimate treasure on a planet called Pandora. It's a great shooter, especially for beginners. Pandora has a vibrant personality with unique wildlife and characters. Beware, everyone pretty much wants to kill you. I played through 4 times, 3 times over the span of several years and once with a friend. Play with a friend, keep in mind you have to share the loot you come across. I liked hoarding all the good stuff when I was solo. 
Quests are read when interacting with NPCs so storyline is existent if you want to read about it, if not, have fun shooting up the place."
4232,"Great game. Levels are very cheaply made but it has very fun gameplay. I played it way less than Borderlands 2, which is probably why I like this one better at this point. If you got into the franchise with BL2, buy this one and have a fun coop or solo experience on a more adult Pandora than the second game. Do not buy The Pre-Sequel. It is shit, no discussion."
4233,ITS GOOD
4234,"There's like a billion positive reviews, why are you even reading this? Just buy it."
4235,"Definitely one of my all time favourite games, just a great way to pass some time. Even better when playing with friends."
4236,Great game still to this day but struggles to pull me through more than 2 playthroughs
4237,"Already beat Borderlands 2?
- Don't even think of getting this one unless you're a *huge* fan of Borderlands series.

New to Borderlands series?
- Go ahead and buy Borderlands 2, not this.

I first beat Borderlands 2 and then played this.
Sure, we all know Borderlands 2 is a true masterpiece.
And yeah, I found BL2 much much better in EVERY aspect.
The mechanics, storyline, graphics, items, etc...
I'd even say it was kind of a pain to play.
6/10 really disappointed :/"
4238,"This. Game. Is. Amazing.

This game can be replayed multiple times without getting bored, everything is achievable on your own and the drop rates are awesome (generally). All the DLC are actually fun to play and follow along with the storyline (apart from one).

I have a level 25 machine pistol called the Cold Torment, I am still using it at level 64 and is better then most of my guns. Each of the characters have their own skill tree and personal skill with different play methods. You could make 2 versions of one character completely dedicated to different play styles. The randomized weapons and names can come up with interesting things like the 'Bloody Anaconda' for example.

Personally I would rather play this then Borderlands 2 if I had to pick even though BL2 is more refined, I just enjoy this game much, much more.

I would recommend buying all the DLC EXCEPT Moxxi's Underdome Riot. This DLC focuses on doing waves of enemies and usually takes over an hour to complete one of them with there being 3 of them (the hard ones). If you are buying GOTY then you shouldn't worry but the DLC is so mind numbingly boring and repetitive.

Hope you enjoyed my review,
have fun playing!"
4239,I think one very nice cartoon game that you can play in co-op mode with some friends !
4240,...
4241,"Fun game, not as fun as Borderlands 2 but on par with the pre-sequel"
4242,"Very good game, very addicting
but the graphics are potato"
4243,"Borderlands is a good game, which ages better than other games of the same period, thanks to its cell-shaded style of graphics.

To be fair, it also has its flaws...
By the time you get to the end of a zone and walk back to get out, the mobs you cleared out have reappeared, which seems so stupid to me that it's hard to believe they let this slide.
The difficulty isn't always very balanced: sometimes it's a walk in the park, until you get swarmed by enemies and it feels like you can't do much about it, except die, then try again using lame guerilla tactics that don't feel very fun to play. It felt like the game was trying to make me understand that I wasn't supposed to play on my own and should have brought teammates.
Finally, the game gets a little bit repetitive after a while.

That being said, the fun is there, and combat sometimes feel refreshingly different from other games. The system of weak spots is a real plus in that regard.

Considering the very low price during sales, I would definitely recommend it."
4244,"Borderlands is an Ego-Shooter 
in which you are on another planet named pandora.
A planet which is full of guns, dangerous animals, crazy people and psychos! ;-;
There are four chooseable charakters, which all have their own skills.
The grafik has an animation style, which gives the game, 
next to the more western looking scenarioand the psychos, an unique style.
I recomend you to play it with friends, which makes much more fun.

Be prepared to stop and think after you see the ending, or just move on to something new. It goes past quick, you might miss it if you blink twice.

4250,"In comparision to BL2 this sucks balls. Low game pace, weird game mechanics."
4251,"Ahh, back when Randy Pitchford wasn't a retard."
4252,"I first played Borderlands a little over 7 years ago on the PS3, and it has since then been my all time favorite game. I decided to purchase it on PC this month to replay through it and the DLC to relieve a short time of my college life those many years ago. Not being an avid PC gamer, this actually has helped me work on some of my mouse-keyboard coordination (not saying I'm great, but definitely improving). The game is as fantastic as ever. The story line is great, there's side quests for you to learn more about the characters, and the DLC just adds so much extra fun to the entire game."
4253,"First game I ever bought on Steam, 84 hours played, 10/10 would buy again."
4254,"English :
I do not recommend this game because there is another newer version of the game available.
Français :
Je ne recommande pas ce jeu car une autre version du jeu plus récente est disponible."
4255,"borderlands style rocks ,and now you upscale it to 4k with nvidia mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm yes"
4256,"This game is the begginning of a very good franchise. It has its own appeal and is entirely an original. Fun gameplay, and it has a storyline you can really immerse yourself in. Compared to new games... this may not be the most visually appealing or interesting play style, but this game was ahead of its time. I still enjoy this and the rest of the games in the series and I cannot wait to see what 2K does from here on out."
4257,"I really enjoyed playing this game for about 7 hours. It is not too easy, but also not too difficult. The world is really big and the enemies evolve with your progress and there are many different of them.
All in all I had a blast playing this game and then I tried to start it for the 15th time or so and it crashes when I try to select a save game. General Purpose Error - File not found. I tired the tutorials, but nothing worked, not even a reinstall on my laptop with a Intel Iris Graphics 550.
I guess because of this and that Steam says there is 0 bytes cloud save I will not play the game in the future - at least not until I get another PC and much time.

It seemes like this problem does not occur often: Take this as a Disclaimer, that this can happen, but if not you can play a really cool game."
4258,"Borderlans is a very nice Coop-game.
The Story ist very unique as well the world 
of Borderlands <3
The fights extremely if you don't play good 
together as a team!
I love this game  and I recommend it..
10/10"
4259,"Good game, classic and whatnot. 
The start to the best series y'know?"
4260,Best game everrrr
4261,Nice game 6.5/10
4262,"STRIP THE FLESH SALT THE WOUND!!!!!!!!


I bought this game only because I got it for like $10 and a buddy recommended it. With that being said I was very very hesitant about it.  First time I played it I loathed the game (character choice was mordaci) and did no optional missions.  However I walked away from it for about 2 months, came back to it and played as Roland.  I instantly became hooked.  After doing 2 or 3 playthroughs with Roland, I then switched characters to Lilth and fell even more in love with the game.  After playing as Lilith for a few playthroughs I then switched characters again to Brick.  Brick is about as fun as hitting yourself with a brick.

Edit: I am in the middle of a playthrough (at time of writing this) with Mordaci and now after seeing how Bloodwing attacks, I prefer Mordaci over Roland.  With that being said Lilith is still my favorite hands down.

Pros:
Fun af
very comical
Re-playable
Deep emmersive story......ish not that deep but its enough to get you hooked.
Thousands of guns and weapons to choice from...however you only probably only use like 10 through the whole game
Sh*tloads to do.
Cl4pt-tp...well do I really need a reason?

Cons
Cl4p-tp.....well do I really need a reason?
some characters are over top annoying
addidtive like crack, you will soon find yourself asking when is the next time I can play?
could be longer


overall I would give it a 9-9.5/10"
4263,Looks good! [spoiler]For 2009[/spoiler]
4264,It is the most fun you could have + you can have moded gun wich do 99999 damage.
4265,"Great game! While there are a few things which Borderlands 2 improved on, this game is still a lot of fun. Lillith is still my favorite character to play in the whole series. This is a solid game which only gets better with the sequel."
4266,bad
4267,Good quick fun for a group.
4268,"not as gud as 2, but still gud. u shud buy"
4269,One of the best games ever made. 10/10
4270,"Getting this was actually a good thing! This game presents to you the first ever RPG FPS, and it was executed perfectly. Its story driven campaigns and DLC's are perfect for those who like a good story. As Marcus had said: ""Im sure we will be doing this all again soon enough!"" That is true for me, because I have replayed this game several times. ( On the XBOX 360. :) )"
4271,"As far as I know the first first person shooter role playing game to grace the gaming world and is a resounding success that has spawned sequels and plenty of DLC you can't go wrong here.

Released some time ago this game still looks good especially with the graphics settings cranked all the way up, the gameplay is intuitive and a joy to behold and the story captivating and zany.

You are a vault hunter on the trail of a long sealed vault said to contain a treasure of legendary proportions, you will have four characters to pick from all specialised for each preferred playstyle (Close Combat, Long Range etc) and each come with their own skill tree which allows further customisation, as you accept quests from people on the planet of Pandora you will earn EXP, weapons, money and new quests to keep you busy as you kill your way across the planet and if that wasn't enough you can even take the fight online adventuring with other vault hunters for the glory of loot and if you are feeling brave challenge them in the arena.

Borderlands is now considered dated by todays standards but on occasion I enjoy nothing more than running over bandits in my car and blowing up monsters with human sized missile launchers and I'm sure you would too."
4272,"Great game bought it to play it again with all the DLC (alrady beat the base game on 360). Few things; the key binding are a little out dated so switch them is a near must, had to play at 480p (will all settings high AF) cause 720 and 1080 would go off the screen, and its not as fun when you play it by yourself and the servers seem to have been dead for awhile (years) :(. other than that it was fun and looking forward beating the DLC for the first time."
4273,"Just played this for the first time recently. Loved it for what it was. It's basically an FPS with some RP elements (i.e. character level and perks/abilites). Lots of satisfying boss battles and loot to be had.

Can get a little bit repetitive but not enough so that I got bored or frustrated."
4274,Welcome to Australia mate
4275,"great leveling and skill system, storyline is amazing, always presents a challenge with enemies that get tougher as you do."
4276,like diablo but with guns D:
4277,"The game play, the action, the fun."
4278,"go to that place, kill that thing, get this item"
4279,"After so many years, I still come back to this game. It's so much simple fun as a solo game, but as a co-op, it really shines. I dislike PvP games of all types, so I guess I'm not typical, but this game does it for me and my friends. Just a couple of hours of co-op is relaxing fun, midlessly violent, and hectic and chaotic. Who doesn't love seeing bandits' heads explode?

The graphics are showing their age, but on the plus side, you can run the game at max from an old laptop, so there's no excuse not to have a friend over to play.

The DLC is not bad, but it doesn't add much to the storyline as they are stand-alone areas. They do add more levels and loot, so there is that.

Finally, the replayability is great. There are 4 very different characters with very different skill trees, and when you complete the game with a beloved charater who's equipped and maxed out as you saw fit, you can play through again (and again) and face tougher and more crazy enemies every time and just keep levelling.

This is an excellent adventure game. I had never played anything like it until I bought it for the PS3. That console has long retired, so now I play it on Steam.

If the above sounds interesting to you, add it to your wishlist and buy the game and DLC when it's on sale. I really hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
4280,"oldie but goodie. If you have played borderlands 2/ TPS and you want more, you might wanna check out borderlands1. It offers all the things that borderlands make great but it misses a lot of qol features."
4281,Call of Diablo: Lords of Modern Warfare.
4282,"Still an amazing game. Very recommend to anyone who is interested in FPS games!
"
4283,"Lots of content with a generally well-written storyline.

Compared to BL2, the mood is more somber with colors less garish and cartoon-like with more muted earth tones."
4284,One of the best.
4285,claptrap strip club good game i love but its boring
4286,"Though I only have 6 hours of playtime on steam, I have played Borderlands before and I rememeber how fun and entertaining it was. So I decided to get this game again and...wow, what a game. It is still so addicting, so much fun, and very interesting. I especially love the fact you can play with friends and do whatever you want with them. You will lose track of time, fair warning. Some mechanical errors and glitches, but nothing that can't be fixed/avoided. If you have never bought this game, or if you have considered doing so, just do it! It's that good. Still as fun as I remember 9 years ago."
4287,moxieeeeee
4288,"How can you not like this game? Fun & funny, Borderlands is like its own genera of game!"
4289,moins bien que le 2
4290,"this game is gud because if funny so fucking VESELO to play with fucking FRENDS you can like drive mashina PIUPIU struya MOCHI ocen krutaya!!!! pravda sobaka udalite pzh bosa etogo MOHRACK ili kakto tak koroche MATPAC he is so hard we were killing him like 30 minutes driving machinas with pulemets otnimesc 1 hp every 10 seconds but it is so fucking interesting wasnt looking for interesting SUJET only PIU PIU TARATTATAT SKIBIDI PAPA final boss so fucking fat frog like shoot in the tongue and eye and he will be likeBABAM very funny to collect fish even though we didnt collect fish 
but gud ugd veri gud!!"
4291,"as expected, lots of fun. UI is dated and the graphics can cause a headache. Otherwise this and it's DLC is pretty much a must have."
4292,Borderlands 2 is Better
4293,"If it took more than one shot, you weren't using a Jakobs!"
4294,"Borderlands is one those games that made you think ""why didn't I think of it ? "" The things that made this game a unique entity when it was released are hardly revolutionary mechanics. But combining FPS with RPG elements was truly a great idea and when coupled with the quirky characters/storyline, it was a receipe for success. One just couldn't stop looting for the next great gun or armor etc... Some of the travelling ( driving ) required in parts of the DLC was however a little repetitive & annoying. Overall, a good start for the franchise.

Edit: The enhanced version is riddled with bugs and crashes. For now, I think it's better to forgo the updated graphics and play bug-free version of the original GOTY edition."
4295,Very good i love it personley better then borderlands 2
4296,Great game.
4297,"The legendary game that made looter shooters a thing. It's even better than Borderlands 2 in some respects. Always a pleasure to come back to this. A timeless classic, without a doubt.

Update (BL1 vs BL2):

1. Loot/drops. I love the random aspect of loot drops in BL1. Any enemy, loot chest could drop a legendary. So it's always worth killing any random spiderant, rakk, bandit and worth looking for hidden chest because it's almost always worth it. Even random lockers can have legendaries. Also, vending machines often have expensive legendaries so it's worth saving up for them. While in BL2, all of this is so astronomically low, that it's just not worth it spending time exploring all the lockers and stuff. Also, scaling. BL1 has linear scaling while BL2 has exponential scaling. Which means that the guns and equipment you find in BL1 are useable for much longer while guns mostly get worthless pretty quickly in BL2.

2. Gun variety (esp. Revolvers). BL1 has some truly amazing and satisfying revolvers. You have mashers (shotgun revolvers), elemental revolvers from Maliwan etc. They hit hard and sound so badass. While BL2's ""fan the hammer"" style revolvers from Jakobs are definitely fun. There just isn't much variety. They all feel nearly the same. The weapon variety just becomes predictable in BL2. You pretty much always know how the gun will feel like when you just look at the stats. Every Torgue weapon is a gyrojet projectile, for instance. Gets kinda old. While in BL1, you can have explosive snipers from Maliwan or explosive revolvers etc. Also, repeaters and revolvers are a separate category in BL1 withe speparate ammo pools which I personally dig.

3. Atmosphere. This isn't a knock on BL2 at all since it has some of the best environments and soundtracks (both ambient and combat) and the writing is great and very funny but there are just *constant* jokes in it which do ultimately get kindaa old. BL1 feels more Mad Max-esque in that sense. You feel like you're in a dangerous wasteland with nothing but crazy bandits and vicious creatures. Skag actually feel like a threat because they are large in number and they just jump you, spit acid at you and more while in BL2 they mostly feel like pups (except for Rabid skags in UVHM). Pscyhos (esp badass ones) actually feel scary sometimes instead of mostly funny. And I love that any Psycho can turn into a Suicide Psycho if it gets low on health. Reload at the wrong time and he'll take you with him. Such a cool mechanic that can take you by surprise. I'm not saying BL1 has necessarily the better atmosphere or anything but it just sometimes feels better when you get in the mood. You just appreciate the silence and/or seriousness. Also, repeated playthroughs in BL are a bit easier because there aren't many waiting periods like there are some in BL2 (the beginning bits are excrutiatingly slow).

4. Proficiency vs Badass rank: I prefer proficiency since it's soomething too work toward and gives solid bonuses. Badass rank doesn't really let you customize your stats since you're ultimately forced to upgrade every stat including Max Health which you might not want because of health gating.

- What BL2 does better: Rocket launchers, unique weapons, grenades, shields, more environments, more music variety, more memorable characters, more enemy variety, more complex mechanics and gameplay systems (melee zer0).

TL;DR Played both games for 1k+ hours each. Love both. I'd like BL3 to take the best of both worlds."
4298,one of the best fps
4299,"This game still looks good after all this time, its one of those games that ages well. Like crysis but with more than 2 guns. Like Dark souls but with more magic. Its like CS:GO but with more hackers, but its ok they want to drop guns at your feet.
Its the game every body wanted Rage to be. It like a Jacky Chan movie but with humor. Its what would happen if the Raiders from FO4 had spacehips. That sort of thing."
4300,"Papa Borderlands. The game that set everything up for the sequels and memes. A dull kind of gameplay with talent trees that don't look that much, but it gets better furthrer in the game. The true Borderlands sass starts with end-game and with the DLCs. I'd recommend skipping this one thought, unless you're planning to play all the Borderlands games, and go straight for Borderland 2.

[i]There's been too many mindblowns after replaying this game, after finishing the other Borderlands games.[/i]"
4301,"Need to mess with configuration files/ install mods to get the game running optimally, great game though"
4302,claptrap
4303,Ets Good Game hehe xd you cna punch bad guys
4304,I cant play with friends what literally (not kidding this time) makes it unplayable for me.
4305,lots of fun
4306,"I was surprised by Borderlands.  It's a decent game, but rather bland, and doesn't deserve the critical acclaim it gets.  If you like to play mostly single player games I'd look elsewhere."
4307,"Check me out, I'm dancin', I'm dancin'!"
4308,paid 2£ for goty edition and it wasnt a mistake this game is fun and full of exploration
4309,"Pros: Great game, worth the price. There is [i]tons[/i] (and I mean that) of content here. The GoTY edition is particularly great and potentially (probably?) has thousands of hours of content in. You can truly lose yourself in this game.

From a technical standpoint, the game runs well. Encountered a minor bug with the game (unhandled exception) related to a mission item (but was worked around by getting a different item first) but nothing that couldn't be sorted. The variety of weapons is endless and you're always having to see whether you've picked a weapon up that's better than your current one (Double Anarchy, anyone?)

Aesthetics, dialogue: the art style is brilliant. The subtlty of the black edges gives the game a well-deserved grungy, hardcore, apocolyptic feel. Dialogue is on point and not-too-serious but still gives you the story.

Cons: Spoilers ahead: [spoiler] the ending really irritated me as it simply didn't give me the satisfaction I was looking for from the story. I expected it to be much more like the Armory in the Knoxx DLC (Armory assault, Super-marcus Sweep etc) where you get to raid a lots of guns. A major let down. It simply wasn't tied up, either, since you then are forced to ""sell"" the vault key back to Tannis for not a lot of money (for me, it was 230k which was <10% of my cash)[/spoiler]

Minor con aside, great game, 9/10 will play again."
4310,"stop browsing reviews just buy the game, and lets catch a ride!!"
4311,Very good shoot ‘N loot game and has online co-op and full controller support!
4312,its real good
4313,I like cars!
4314,I APPROVE OF THIS CYBER GAME FAM
4315,"You probably played the sequel first, And now you're wondering is this as good well its pretty close to being as good as borderlands 2 exept a weird weapon profficency system but other than that it is pretty great, execpt the underdome dlc is just a waste of money if you plan on buying any of the game's expansions."
4316,Rooty Tooty Point'N Shooty Lots O Looty!
4317,10/10
4318,"I reccommend this game for being a classic and having fun moments. Make sure to get this game on sale, though, since the game can get pretty repetetive at times, considering the small enemy variety, oversaturation of like quests, and drab story. Better yet, if you haven't played it already, get Borderlands 2 instead which fixes many of the flaws of this game."
4319,It was surprisingly boring. Nothing really had any feeling of impact on anything. And that includes this game's impact on my heart.
4320,"My first introduction to Borderlands was on the 360 at my cousins' house back in 2009. He picked Brick and I went with Roland and the rest is history. Some weapons we found were awesome, others were complete turds (in part due to my poor controller aiming skills, other weapons were just plain bad). We moshed our ways through playthroughs 1 and 2 having a grand old time. Some of the walking/driving segments felt a little long in PT2 once the mystery and excitement of exploration was gone and we knew where we were going, but that never stopped us from racing towards the next developer chest eager to snatch the best weapons before the other could. While the humor has all been revealed to me may years past there's a lot of delightful gems for new players to see, hear and discover. The game takes itself seriously in some sense, but at the same time it understands just how ridiculous things can be in the right quantities (though some enemy combat lines may grow thin).

Of the DLCs Zombie Island was an absolute blast the moment we stepped in. Admittedly easier in some parts due to a grand majority of the zombies being melee, I still consider it a fun place to this day with the abundance of heads to put in your crosshairs. 

Knoxx DLC brought a whole load of rare weapons and items into the mix, plus some of the premier loot grinding spots. If you're just playing through once or twice there's plenty of jokes, loot, and heads to pop. If you're here chasing down the best of the best gear this is where you can expect to spend a lot of time between the high quality Lance Chests and the lone uberboss of the game: Crawmerax the Invincible. 

Moxxi's DLC is underwhelming, though noteworthy because its (really,really,painfully long) quest chains give an extra skill point in both playthroughs. Biggest plus of Moxxi's is that you get a bank to Stache Yo Loot. The arena gameplay would be more enjoyable if it gave more loot and you didn't have to wait forever between waves.

Claptrap robolution is the last of the DLCs and was made by a different crew. It's noticeable, some of the jokes are a bit stretched (especially considering the reused and parodied content), all the chests in the areas don't give out much quality loot, and there's not much else to say other than you get a skillpoint from the main quest in PT1 and PT2. 


Graphics & Controls: this being PC master race there are ini tweaks to be done to improve this 2009 game's functionality. If you are impatient and hate prodding around ini files be warned that the in game sensitivity slider is absolute garbage. If you don't mind inis take a look at the wikia where a bunch of helpful tweaks are detailed (fov, remove startup movies, adjust weapon statcard text)


After giving BL2 a go and finding not everything to my liking I gained a new appreciation for a lot of the things that BL 1 did right. Weapons manufacturers aren't effectively additional subclasses of weapons on top of the existing definitions (AR, sniper, revolver etc), they're more a case of subtle variants and acquired tastes. There's more weapon parts and a smattering of rare combinations that yield unusually powerful weapons in select circumstances. But most glaringly 

>>>> A GOOD WEAPON/SHIELD YOU GET WON'T BE UTTERLY USELESS IN 3 LEVELS <<<<

Yeah, BL1 doesn't have the quadratic scaling you see in BL2"
4321,burger town
4322,great game. probably one of the best ever. but if you buy this game fork out for goty or youre wasting you money. you are going to want the dlc once you play and paying another 40 bucks is a rip off. they should make a dlc bundle.
4323,nice
4324,Pra mim o segundo melhor jogo que eu ja joguei na minha vida
4325,"[h1]KaBOOM![/h1]

[b]Borderlands is not getting old at all. It`s amazing how fun, long and original this game is.[/b] What`s more, after 9 years from the release date you can still easily find people to play with - this says almost everything about quality of this game. 

The formula is super easy. You choose one of four playable characters and begin a mission to find a mystical vault. On your way there you will have a chance to complete plenty of well-written and fun quests, level up your character and build him in a way you want - [b]Borderlands have many RPG elements[/b].
 
Loot system is similar to this introduced in Diablo series. All items have their class and level, so you are pretty much changing gear all the time. Weapons look great and they also have many different effects, so you`re ending up with inventory full of nice guns. 

DLC`s are quite good as well. Beside Moxxi's Underdome Riot they offer new content, missions and bosses. Mentioned Underdome Riot is a tournament in which you struggle against many, many... too many waves of enemies. Don`t get me wrong, it`s nice, but too long in the end.

[b]Borderlands is a game everyone should try. Give it a chance and you won`t regret it.[/b]

Playing this with an additional 3 friends will expedite the adventure and make it feel shorter but with the more friends the better the loot. You can clear the game by yourself but it is at points a drag where there is a lot of fetch quests that can be completed much faster with friends.

Either way you play this game is a wonderful time."

A variety of places to go, missions to complete, and when you shoot someone in their weakspot, your character shouts something funny. What's not to like? 

If you need more story and don't care about some nonsense, skip this game. Otherwise, try it and have fun."

This game... for some reason i keep going back to it every now and then. I have additionally around +300h off steam in it. It's one of those rare titles (series) where dlcs are actually worth to get.

So what's so good about this game?
+ psychos,
+ A LOT of different kinds of weapons,
+ catchy soundtrack,
+ art style (aka 'cell shading'),
+ insanity of psychos,
+ quite interesting story,
+ psychos,
+ 4 playable characters, each one with different skills/perks,
+ perfect for coop with friends (up to 4 people),
+ overall very unique gameplay,
+ dealing critical damage 'feels' rewarding and strangely addictive,
+ did i mention psychos?

As for cons (some of which may be subjective):
- Human enemies have a bit ""jittery"" animations/movements, sometimes it feels like they can predict when you're gonna shoot and split second before you pull the trigger suddenly they may decide to run/crouch/start zigzagging/change their position very quickly. (Even though i like to play at max difficulty settings - this can be really annoying sometimes)
- Invisible walls ""here"" and ""there"", although usually noticeable if you decide to look for some good higher spots to engage the enemy.
- Default FOV may be too narrow for some people, (it can be changed with for example ""Borderlands Config Editor v2.1.4"" which additionally has some other interesting settings that may improve the overall gameplay experience).

I'm a ""skag dentist"" and i love being hit by psychos' axes from over 9000 kilometers away.

Psychos are not bad, they're just misunderstood."
4357,The game artstyle is really interesting and fun to play with friends. Though i wish there was more character development. I hardly get to know the characters you are it feels like. Even with the spin off games.
4358,Its one Hell of a game just awesome. Best humor you will ever find in a game
4359,"I strongly recommend playing this game BEFORE Borderlands 2. Not because of the story, but because of the features. There's a handfull of stuff that is shit about this game but was improved/fixed in Borderlands 2 and it will really get to you if you're spoiled on the improvements.
The main one being quest objectives. If there's multiple collectibles in a fetch quest scattered across a zone, this game only displays one of them and they display it in the most infuriating way. They will tell you to go to one edge of the map first then go to the opposite side of the map next. THEN they will tell you to go all the way back to the previous side where the first item was to collect the 3rd item that was hidden almost right next to the first. In BL 2 they have multiple quest objectives which is a god send.
Another complaint I have with this game and yes it is silly but COSMETICS. This game gives you a color palette to choose from to customize 3 different parts of your character. By normal means this seems pretty good right? But BEHOLD in Borderlands 2 you can unlock unique headpieces and color schemes through multiple means whether it be through rare drops, completing quests, finding secrets, even reaching character challenge checkpoints. The point is you could customize your character with your achievements which is extremely cool and makes me feel hyped hunting the same worthless enemy for multiple hours just to get it's rare color skin. IN THIS GAME there's no cosmetics to collect. 
See what I mean? 
Play Borderlands 1 before 2. Actually I probably shouldn't have said all that because now you're probably more hyped to just skip to Borderlands 2. No don't stop. STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP"
4360,you shoot
4361,"Dull.

Annoying."
4362,"Borderlands is a really fun game to play solo or with some friends. The humor in the game is great you'll constantly find yourself giggling at some dirty reference or joke. I really enjoyed the game and it is rather easy to run on PC at this stage. If you've got a mid range PC you should easily be able to max it out and still have good fps. The art style is really nice and different from the usual games that strive for realism, this one aims for a cartoonish look which suits its story well. I'd give it a 10/10 and would recommend you pick up this game and give it a try if you love to shoot shit and the odd dirty joke here and there."
4363,this has been one of my all time favorite games
4364,the side quests tend to be fetch quests and i didn't quite like exploring the map as much as i did with bl2 but a good game nonetheless
4365,This is an amazing game as it has hours of fun!
4366,"For a post-apocalyptic first person shooter adventure RPG that's not called ""Fallout"".....this one's pretty alright."
4367,"Awesome game, so funny. I loved playing it."
4368,"Playing borderlands in 2018 after completing borderlands 2 and pre-sequel is not good.
this is basic story for BL2 and pre-sequel, when everthings has begun.

+ story definitely 10/10

- graph (2018) sick"
4369,"the game that launched an epic series. borderlands 1 is fantastic, even though borderlands 2 improves literally everything on this game. 

borderlands 1 still holds up to the test of time. it's a looter-shooter  in first person with third person driving. there are a couple minor flaws with inventory management and map design, both of which will make you do some boring and menial tasks, but overall the gameplay is still solid. the guns are awesome, the gunplay is fun.

this game is much better with friends, so grab some buds, grab some guns, and get some loot, vault hunter!"
4370,good
4371,"The state this game is in is pathetic.
By default the FOV is locked at 70, you need to edit some config files to change it.
Not only that, but since you can't simply change the default value, you have to make a bind and every time you exit a vehicle or respawn your FOV will reset. While sprinting your FOV becomes larger and it's very distracting as well. Meanwhile using your melee attack, your FOV will go down to something like 60 or 70 for a good second.
You have to keep holding the right mouse button down to aim, there is no toggle by default. Again, you have to edit some config file and hope it works.
The scrollwheel doesn't work in menus, you have to use your arrow keys to scroll up and down.

This game is a mess. Unless you wanna spend an hour trying figure out how to correctly edit the config files and test them one by one, don't bother getting this game. I played it for several hundred hours on 360, but the fact that I have to find a workaround for half the game on PC makes me not wanna play this version at all.
It doesn't make the game's overall quality bad, but when I have to go through all this trouble before I can enjoy the game, then there is something wrong.

4372,"Building this game around 4 player co-op was a genius move but I'm still a little on the fence with Borderlands. A lack of variety in the enemies and quests, even in the DLC, make playing on your own a bit of a drag in the long run. I ultimately decided to recommend this because blasting skags with three of your friends is an experience that's hard to find elsewhere. Do yourself a favour and get your friends in on this.

Now get off my bus."
4373,All boarderlands games are recommended
4374,"Play the enhanced edition, BL1 has a way cooler look to it than BL2, but is nowhere near as fun."
4375,"Started my playthrough with the sniper guy, I thought i made a big mistake playing him because of the shitty accuracy of the sniper and every weapon in general but I got used to it. 
I hated how the quest work, like it woudnl't tell you where to look for the closest place, no, you have to go there then come back then go far there and come back again.

I really woudnl't say it's a good game, but to be fair, it's fun and that's what counts right?"
4376,"A great game, made even greater with friends.  Countless loot and endless hordes of enemies that range from bandits to giant crabs who can only be kill by taking advice from the Sony E3 conference in 2006.  All games with cell-shaded graphics age well visually.  The characters are all charming and I always find myself laughing at the various antics.  This is one of the few light-hearted shooters available at the time.  I've personally done multiple playthroughs across all the platforms it's available on and will probably have a few more in the years to come."
4377,god himself is in it
4378,"Considering how it's more than 8 years since the game was first released, I personally would still recommend getting this one, especially if you're a fan of the Borderlands series in general. If you have played the later versions like Borderlands 2 or TPS, this one will feel like a downgrade. Still, the gameplay is compelling with the same dash of Borderlands-style of dank humor.

If you intend to get this, it would be better to wait for a sale and also, find a bunch of friends to play with. Solo play is fine but it's more slow-paced as compared to the later versions and may not be enjoyed by some, especially if you're used to the faster-paced, action-packed FPSRPGs of the modern era."
4379,"More often compared to the Diablo series than other FPS games the Borderlands game that launched it all stands the test of time. The more constrained story is a benefit in terms of story telling and player direction but lack of freedom is a slight at times. But at this point Borderlands is a known item and it is worth getting regardless of genre you enjoy.

Value metric: Does it have a value of $1 per hour of gameplay? Yes
"
4380,"I've loved the Borderlands franchise since my husband got me into it when we were dating 8 years ago. I had never really liked this kind of shooting game before, and I was really bad at it. Now I love these kinds of games, and I think I've got a lot better at them!

I've put in countless hours on the Playstation system, so that doesn't reflect here on Steam."
4381,"still Great!
"
4382,One of the bests 4 player co op games ever. Very fun if u have friends.
4383,"It's not a bad game, but I can't say it's actually good or engaging.

It's funcional. Little to no bugs. It can be fun with friends to help make it more entertaining, but the game on its own never delivers much engagement or fun.

PvP is a mess, don't even bother unless you wanna go for shits and giggles.

It's not my style, but if you want a better experience, go play Borderlands 2"
4384,Gotta love it!
4385,I love this game. Some things that I have issues with. Really only 2 of the 4 DLC's are actually playable. The Moxxi DlC is singler player only. Unfortunate as I played the majority of the entire game in CO-OP which is one the main highlights of the game in my personal opinion. You really are doing yourself a disservice if you never try CO-OP. Though the game on its own in single player is also a joy. If you do pick up the game I would really advice getting the GOTY as you get all the DLC. General Knoxx and Dr. Ned are really good DLC that are totally worth picking up.
4386,"game is good enoyed it,but god damn the dlcs are annoying."
4387,"Ok so, Borderlands, yeah? S'pretty good. I mean, you got people on a bus, right? These people on the bus. They're looking like they got kicked out of a bar in the middle of the desert, ok? Whatever, doesn't matter. Anyway, they're riding this bus with the best opening song ever, No Rest For The Wicked by Cage The Elephant. Ten out of Ten, would listen to again. Ok so, this fat greedy guy with gold teeth drops you off in front of this desert town. Rude, right? Whatever, this stupid ass robot comes up to you and within ten seconds you want to rip his ocular sensor out of his trapezoid head, yeah? You're gonna hate him, but you need him for some reasons. You don't know those reasons, but you know your character knows so you go with it, ok? Then, this weird force-ghost chick appears in your head. You think you're going crazy within the first minute of the game, but she's supposed to help you, or something? I don't know. Anyway, you kill some dog-alien things, some masked guys with buzzsaws, great time. You find some crazy bitch who got left on this planet for some reasons, because P L O T. She needs you to go find some keys that open some locks for some doors, because CON TENT. Whatever, you do what she wants because you want to get the game over with so you can move on to the far superior sequel, yeah? So you go find these keys for these locks for these doors. Great. Along the way you meet some asshat who lives in a junkyard who doesn't like you very much for some reasons, you meet this redneck guy named Scooter who fucks his sister AND his mother, and you kill some more aliendogs and bandits and some more things. Whatever, great. You get all the keys because the psycho bitch said so, AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW? SHE IS WORKING FOR SOME OTHER PSYCHO BITCH THAT WANTS THE KEYS FOR THE LOCKS FOR THE DOORS FOR HERSELF. Whatever, you gotta go kill the second psycho bitch now. Why not kill the first psycho bitch, you might be wondering. Well, because Borderlands 2 needs her for the P L O T for the second one. Fine, whatever. S'good. So you follow Psycho Bitch #2, and she leads you into this snowy mountain with aliens and shit. Not the alien dogs or anything, but like actual flying aliens that fire guns and shit. Yeah, s'pretty lit. So you fight these aliens and Psycho Bitch #2's henchmen, and then you F I N A L L Y get to the Vault. THE DOOR WITH THE LOCK THAT IS OPENED WITH THE KEY. F U C K Y E A H. Psycho Bitch #2 opens the lock on the door with the key that you spent 30+ hours in getting. She thinks she's won. Whatever. A giantass tentacle pops out of the door and spears through her. Fantastic. Anyway, a giant Cthulhu with a third eye and a beak plops himself onto the mountain. You shoot the thing in its third eye for massive damage, killing it. You then find out that this force-ghost bitch is actually just a computer program in a satellite orbiting the planet, SETTING YOU UP FOR THE INEVITABLE SEQUEL. DUN DUN DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. 

  

The End."
4388,"The game is a masterpiece.
To this day it still holds its own and can be very fun.

The gameplay is what truly makes Borderlands great. 
Gunplay in particular is just so satisfying. Unlike BL2, you are not crazily dependant on the type of gun you have (until late game as you refine and optimise your build). Normally this would be bad for a game so focused on loot, but it's the opposite. It encourages you to try out new guns and new combinations. Unique character builds also enhance the experience. I will admit that compared to today's games their trees really aren't that interesting or diverse, they still work enough to make making new builds fun. Sadly late game if you buy all the DLC the level cap goes up. This would normally be a good thing, but the skill trees were obviously not meant to have so many points. That's the only real downside. Skills are still really fun and balanced enough to change up the gameplay without making you too over/underpowered. Also killing imho is hugely more satisfying in Borderlands than in most other games (even BL2). The way your enemy either melts,  explodes into little pieces or ragdolls away is just right. (especially for the time it was made). And as you are encouraged to try new and different guns, and as you level up and gain skills, you also get to experience the different ways you can kill enemies even further.

Speaking of exploration in gunplay and skills, maps are also very well designed. Somehow, even when the vast majority of the base game is in a depressing desert wasteland, you still get a sense of exploration and discovery the first time you. If you are like me, having that feeling in games like borderlands is vital. Some side missions may be slightly uninspired, but the maps make up for it. Also not to say BL2 is bad, but one thing that it gets completely wrong is the driving. Now unfortunately the driving in all 3 Borderlands games kind of sucks (mainly due to invisible walls and weird physics), but thanks to the map design in Borderlands 1, driving exploration is still cool and gives you kind of a mad max vibe.

I will quickly add the enemy variety and difficulty is excellent. If you follow the main path, it isn't that hard, but if you go off and explore you can easily find a challenge (usually a rewarding challenge). Also the late game is still great. It isn't like BL2, which is a game that really nails having fun in the late game, but you can still get a lot of satisfying challenges.

I will also quickly mention that the graphics are great. They are not super fancy or overloaded with different effects, but it kind of works perfectly in the cartoon/comic visual style. A quality that really makes Borderlands shine against other games with much more complex and detailed graphics.

Playing with friends is not necessary, but greatly enhances the gameplay. You now have to think about how you can cover your team mates faults and gunplay and strategy becomes very teamwork focused. Unlike modern day FPS, focusing on loot is very optional. You can either just use whatever guns you find until late game, or you can grind and pay attention to any opportunity that presents itself. In Co-op this is also true and is usually very balanced.

Story is really great despite what some people say. Not just because it is interesting or well written. But because it is not at all intrusive or annoying. Most of the story is experienced in two ways. In the missions and in logs/echos. Now you can skip it all. You don't need to read a thing and you will still have a blast. But you can also read everything and explore the open non-linear world and look for more. 
One problem some people had when the game was released is that the ending (no spoilers) might seem a bit disappointing. But if you actually read the story and mission logs and paid attention it makes complete sense. So don't let anyone tell you that the story sucks because the ending, they are 99% likely to just be talking out of their ass.

Last major point that needs to be addressed is just how insanely top notch DLC is in this game (and in the borderlands series in general). While not being essential, it is highly recommended to get all the story DLC. They are all insanely fun, and imho more fun that the base game. 



IN SUMMARY. If you are ever even remotely interested in the Borderlands Series, starting off with number 1 is always worth it. The game is just so great to play even now compared to a lot of other similar FPS RPGs. Borderlands gets essentially nothing wrong and yet gets so many things right that it is actually hard to ever not recommend.

EDIT: I will add that one downside is that there is no FOV slider. However you can very easily change it by going into the files. There are countless tutorials on the internet and it only takes like 10 seconds. So imho I would not consider the lack of an FOV slider to be a real downside."

Controls [keyboard & mouse for me] are easy to reach and remember, there's still a story for those who want that in a game, and it's challenging; puzzles and items aren't just handed to you. It's an oldie, but a goodie in my opinion."
4393,I played this so many times. Good game.
4394,This game was OK. I found it to be pretty repetitive but overall it's pretty good.

4396,"Great looter/shooter with some of the best writing and most memorable characters I've seen in a while.
The art style is one of those love-it-or-hate-it deals and even though I don't like it as much as I think I
would if they went with a more realistic-looking approach, I can't deny its originality and how the style
lends itself to the overall silly tone of the game. It doesn't take itself too seriously and that has a lot to
do with why it's a seriously good-time."

4400,"If you want to play an example of an unoptimized game for PC made 10 years ago, Borderlands 1 is the game for you.

It reminds me of playing Halo after playing Perfect Dark. PD had *everything*. Stats, maps, bots, codes, challenges, options, content, it was simply ahead of it's time. Then you go play Halo cause suddenly all of your friends got it for their birthdays and it has nothing. At all. Barebones but at least it was solid and had LAN play.

Blands is not solid. Nor liquid. Just a gassy ball of a gamble that paid off and then some. Artists saved this series."

4404,"While I want to recommend this game I don't think I can. It has a few too many thinks about it that irk me for me to warrant a recommendation. 

First off, the FOV sucks and makes me nausious and there is no FOV slider so it causes me motion sickness. It looks like you're head is constantly stretched forward toward your gun. 

The story is ass, well, there isn't really a story at all. You just kind of appear to be looking for a vault, but there's so little information. It's just very vague. 

The weapons are too weak and make certain areas a chore to deal with. I did every side quest in an area that I could before progressing farther into the ""story"" missions and still could not get past some of the new retarded bullet sponge gun wall enemies which makes you resort to cowering behind an object in the environment which breaks their line of sight but not yours. It honestly makes me feel like I'm playing a PS2 game, and not one of the good ones.

Pros:
- Graphics
- Game environment
- Story

- Controls (definitely playable but could still be refined)
- Collision (again playable but could still be refined)

I hope there's an option to forge items rather that to farm it. =)

I really recommend this game but I would advise to buy it during sale rather than paying full price. It's a bit old to be bought with its full price. Even much better to buy it with bundles!
"
4421,"i prefer bl2, but i do like how much darker it is, and the serious moments."
4422,THIS IS THE BEST FPS RPG OF ALL TIME FOR ME
4423,"I ve been seriously in love with this game since it was released, i ve had countless hours on it before i got it on Steam and two complete playthroughs and i have a third on the way. Graphics is loveable, nothing perfect, but even these days it looks pretty and characters and quests are fun and unusual for an FPS. Also what gives this game more replay value is the coop, which makes this game as twice as better. Would recommend it 10/10 anyway, this game is simply iconic."
4424,"If there's one thing that FPS games tend to share nowadays, it's a level of tedious mediocrity that seems to emerge in several different areas of game development, aside from the default ""you shoot the enemies and the enemies shoot back"" gameplay mechanic, run for cover when your health is low, step out of cover with a full clip so your reload time doesn't bend you over a barrel for a 3-5 second quicky as you frantically serpentine through the bullet storm (pun intended, since Gearbox now owns the rights to Bulletstorm), and of course, finding yourself sparking the firefight in either a desert wasteland, a gray/brown industrial area, or a cityscape littered with debris, active demolition, and several angry calls to the mayor. So, to split away from this increasingly bland recipe, Gearbox has delivered a game that combines FPS with RPG elements, thereby adding the fun-filled mechanics of HP bars, elemental status changes, and bullets that turn into flying damage numbers whenever they come in contact with angry-looking baddies.

Borderlands takes place on the planet Pandora, where four mercenaries with varying skills search for the legendary Vault, since the name itself certainly implies that discovering it would be the equivalent to finding a golden ticket to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, walking away with riches, fame, and a giant chocolate waterfall. During their quest, they receive intervals of positive reinforcement from a ""Guardian Angel"" of sorts, which is presumably some sort of conscious AI that only makes an appearance during the main story missions, reminding you of what to do next as well as why you are on Pandora in the first place. I appreciate the soccer mom attitude, but I'm pretty sure I have a handle on what to do next, especially since every quest I agree to is fastidiously logged in my handy-dandy notebook, thank you very much!

Gearbox at least makes an attempt to keep things interesting with pop culture references scattered throughout the primary and secondary missions and gives you a massive plethora of guns to collect throughout your travels, each with varying attributes and elemental perks. Unfortunately, this only creates the illusion that there are a bajillion different weapons in the game, since they're all only boiled down to the basic categories when the ancillary attributes are stripped away. You got your pistols, rifles, SMGs, shotguns, snipers, rocket launchers, and in very rare cases, alien technology weapons that sure, have infinite ammo, but overall provide about as much use as a slingshot at a carnival game. The attributes themselves provide varying ups and downs towards clip capacity, firepower, reload speed, recoil, and the occasional elemental flare that can be useful against specific enemy types, which should practically be second nature knowledge after how long Pokemon has been around. But because these attributes vary so vastly and so frequently, alongside the fact that finding weapons is as easy as finding used Solo cups in a frat house, you find yourself in a rather conflicting dilemma every time you come across a new chest full of peashooters and skim over their selling points, wondering if it's worth giving into the Packrat Syndrome that many gamers like myself tend to suffer from and just carry around all the extra inventory until you manage to get to the nearest vending machine so you can repeat the vicious cycle all over again.

Sure, this constant, repetitive chore of ""keep the best, sell the rest"" bumps up your in-game funds significantly, but I can't help but feel like it's an advanced form of hoarding, since the game certainly makes it difficult to not engage in the obsessive compulsive pattern since you not only need large amounts of money to buy the best gear (all within the 20 minute timeframe you have to buy said gear before the vendors re-streamline their inventory), but you also need money to stay alive, since funds are deducted from your in-game account after you die, depending on how much you have. If my respawning was handled the way the American govermment handles Medicare, I'd rather settle for the manual checkpoints and the game over screen! At least you can maintain some control over everything you've earned up to that point without having to worry about being cost-effective for each digital resurrection.

The characters you play as each possess their own unique abilities and passive buffs, which can be built up as you level up and gain further experience. There's even an option where you can ""respec"" your character and reassign your skill points to other areas in case you come to find that a particular attribute you beefed up before was about as helpful as an aloe vera application on a third degree burn. Unfortunately, aside from the lengthy amount of time it takes to level up as you continue on to later parts of the game, your characters also have a level cap, which has been extended by an additional 11 levels by a recent update, but still leaves you unable to max your character out to their fullest potential, so choosing the right attributes to beef up and by how much becomes a strategic migraine. You can change the appearance of your characters at the respawn points, but since the only time the camera zooms out into third-person view is when you are in a vehicle puts a bit of a damper on bringing any genuine connection growth between the character and the player. There also seems to be limited character enrichment since the only times you ever hear them speak are when you level up, discover rare loot, or pull off a critical headshot. Not that I want a constant barrage of one-liners until they reach the point of meaninglessness (the creators of Gex could certainly take a hint from that), but it's like we're only talking to ourselves when the situation calls for it, like we're somehow a ragtag band of Vault hunters with autism.

Overall, though, I like Borderlands. At least it's trying something new and different from all the legions of ""ball of doodie"" clones stacking up in the market. And it kept me interested enough to see it through to the end, even if it did ultimately end up soiling itself. Despite the tedious running around and the repetitive gameplay, it certainly balances itself out with the extensive list of sidequests, the crafty weapon designs, and the amusing babbling from the psychos that speed towards you, lining themselves up for solid shrapnel sandwich. Give it a chance, but I can't blame you if you end up growing bored with it and start breaking out the old-fashioned Minesweeper again."
4425,"Diablo loot meets solid FPS mechanics. 
Tons of replayability.
Highly recommended.
"
4426,"Still a great game! I started in the Borderlands series with playing Borderlands 2. When playing Borderlands 1 you will see that a lot of the the complaints of the game where all fixed in the second game. 

What I found in this game was
- The rare weapons spawned a lot more making the game a bit unbalanced at times.
- The boss fights are a lot easier compared to borderlands 2. (Certainly the final boss)
- DLC's are definitly worth it although a lot shorter then borderlands 2
- The game works with a multiple playthrough system meaning that the enemies only level up with new playtroughes and don't level with you like in badass mode. This system does have some adventage. Mainly that you can finish all the old quest after the final boss.

4427,"Great game that started off a great series! It is a little bit outdated at this point, so you might be better off watching some YouTube videos about the lore and playing Borderlands 2. Still worth a shot if you are new to the series though, I would recommend it!"
4428,this is where it all started. Dark humor mixed with cell shaded world. Darkest Borderlands of all.
4429,"The very first Borderlands
didn't have much Soundtrack, kinda boring playing whole story
go get friend to play with, kinda boring too playing alone
but other than that, the game is Fine in my opinion
so i give Blue Thumb"
4430,"All the loot drops of a Diablo-style loot hunter with none of the enemy variety, charm, or anything else of interest."
4431,100% Recommend
4432,Very fun and entertaing FPS.
4433,"Still a good game in 2018, but I recommend you pick up BL2 unless you want to play the entire franchise.

Borderlands 1 is VERY bad at handling Coop, and has the weakest mechanics and story of all the games. After playing the franchise, this one is very painful to play.

But not considering the other borderlands games, BL1 is a very comedic take on a creative mix of genres that before borderlands was very hardly explored. Even in modern day, Borderlands is still #1 of its kind, beating out the very disappointing Destiny and Destiny 2. There's so much content in here.

A must-play for any fan of FPS games, at least once. An absolute steal if you can get it on sale for a few bucks."
4434,the game that started borderland I love it its pretty cool and is pretty good

4436,Nice game
4437,Have been playing Borderlands for a long time now on a various spread of consoles and  I have enjoyed every minute of each game in the series. 10/10
4438,"Funny fps lootdrop rpg.
Or fighting game if you play brick."
4439,can't maximize skill tree without cheat engine

Do yourself a favor and grab some energy drinks and 
don't forget to bring some snacks with you
Cause some ish is about to get out of hand"

Simple but unique at the same time!
Got hooked for hours!"
4442,good gam
4443,"This game shows its age a bit, but it has a good story and gives background to Borderlands 2."
4444,Probably the best game ever. Period.
4445,While I have currently only barely gotten started with this game I have enjoyed it immensly so far! Especialy once I got the vehicles unlocked I have enjoyed going around and running down enemies and blowing them away with the weapons of them! I may have only played the game for a relativly short amount of time so far but I love it currently!

4448,"Awesome game, great setting. Begining of epic journey."
4449,"I love this game. I own it on all my consoles and I really enjoyed playing it again on pc. The coliseum dlc thought, is the worst DLC on the videogame history. Very linear, long to complete and boring. Besides that the game is a masterpiece."
4450,"Not as good as Borderlands 2, but still pretty good."
4451,"Great game, I love the borderlands franchise, looking to get BL3 when it come out."
4452,10/10 good gam

4456,Buen juego para jugar con amigos :D
4457,"The original, the introduction, the very beginingish\\\\ There is the prequel but still. Where it all started again a slight ish. It set up the best FPS ever Borderlands 2. Set the ground work for the better BL 2, but you get to know pandora, so get it and then get BL2. BL1 is good but BL2 is gooder.... more gooder........ more good....... you get what I'm trying to say right?"
4458,Cant wait to put in more hours in this classic game! must buy does not need much to run!
4459,"ONE OF THE BEST FPS, PERIOD."

4462,"If you have Windows 10 and you're planning to play this game, OH you're gonna LOVE the 20fps, dude. All those psychos coming at you and you're gonna look like an 80 years old man who can't barely hold a weapon, you're gonna love the fps drop from 62 to 15 when they come, it's so much fun! Borderlands now is a ""80 years old dude with a gun in the desert"" simulator, 10/10.

Tried to find a fix for this, but only worked for a few hours, then back to the ""80 years old dude with a gun in the desert"" simulator (20fps hellz yea).  

Plus, check this out: https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/5q1enl/borderlands_terrible_framerate_on_windows_10/ , you'll see what I'm talking about. 

I'm still trying to play this sh*t till my patience runs as low as the fps, then I quit, but that's how much I liked the game to stand this kinda problem. The game is pretty good, I like it, but the world isn't for the weak, son, gotta be a man and stand the 15~20fps. Right?"
4463,good
4464,"i dont like this game becouse
[1] poor story
[2] bad graphics

if you are looking for coop and multiplayer aspects then this may be a game worth you time but if you are not dont get this unless its value is below 2$ or something like that."

dont get the dlc's. they dont scale with your level, 
so they're really boring.

4467,"[h1][u][b]Short Version[/b][/u][/h1]
Very enjoyable!

[h1][u][b]Long Version[/b][/u][/h1]
I've actually come to like this game.... Was kinda forced to play it by a friend of mine who kept nagging me about it...lol And then I finally caved... Anyways, besides being enjoyable, there wasn't anything else I didn't like....besides the arena DLC......which I'll go into detail in the ""Other notes"" section of this review.

It seems to borrow some elements from the BioShock series, in that the tape recordings make an appearance for your ""go here and get this kind of mission quest"" and the usual voice over with a potrait(on top right of screen) of the person who somehow got your number and is contacting you through with....your ECHO (Does that stand for anything or is it just all in caps for the hell of it - because that's what's shown ingame? hahaha) device I believe....

[h1]Story[/h1]
I actually found the story quite short, I was putting in quite some effort to immerse myself in the world and my character (so no fast travel except to get to the DLC locations which cannot be reached by normal means, and cleared out the entire area everytime it resets with enemies and loot respawned) only to be cut short after what looks a boss fight... And then the credits rolled and I was like ""Oh.....is that it?! That can't be it!! There has to be more than that!""

After that, it was either go back through all the areas you've previously visited and clean them all up to grind your level for the next playthrough, yes there appears to be an equivalent ""New Game+"" kind of thing where you restart from scratch, at least storywise but still continue on with the existing character but the enemies are harder and loot will be better. And if you've finished that playthrough, apparently there's a ++ version after that which is basically 2.5 where ALL enemies (and I think loot too) are scaled to whatever character level you are so you could redo the entire story again at lvl 69 (max level if you have all the DLCs) again for that challenge. 

But yeah, there was a cliffhanger and I'm guessing that's where Borderlands 2 start off......or maybe PreSequel as that's before 2 but after the first...? I guess I'll find out when I get around to them...heh...

The DLCs do continue the story on a bit I suppose in a way, except the arena one which is mostly gay...lol 

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Looking great actually, for a game that's ran on unreal engine 3. Frame rate starts from 30 to 150 ish, depending on location and resolution and of course your graphical settings(and other variables like hardware), and this was @ 1440p 16:9 with a single Nvidia Geforce GTX 770. The 30fps was on that giant digger, I don't actually know the proper name for it, where you take on Taylor Kobb I think it was. As for the highend, well there are too many to set as examples, but I guess the main menu counts? hahahahaha

What I don't like about it is that it streams the texture and goes from really crap looking to whatever setting you have checked in about a couple of seconds. It may be something minor but I 'd rather it instantly start off at whatever settings you've set it off, than it gradually getting there.... It just seems off, you know? 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
It's a mix of action and some RPG elements, but mostly action....hah. You can play either in first person or third person after a hack edit (because what kind of game that has at least some RPG elements not have an option to view your playing character?) But, I do admit it plays better in first person than third person as is intended. 

So the action bit is you mainly run and gun rambo style if you can do it. The RPG side is that each character has a skill tree you can put points into after leveling to 5 and beyond. There are four characters, Roland the soldier, Brick the beserker, Mordecai the hunter and that woman, Lillith that's right, the um....siren (had to google that one up coz I forgot lol)

Each character have their own weakness and strengths, I've only played Roland and not much of the other three so I can't comment on them but with Roland, you can deploy a sentry turret to help in your fight which will disappear after a period of time(I kinda wished it wouldn't so it would only disappear if it's destroyed but can pick it up and re-deploy elsewhere if it doesn't get destroyed in your last battle) and some skills to either increase your infantry, support or and medic roles in the game. He's pretty much an all rounder, favouring combat rifles and shotguns of course as that's what he's skills focus on mainly. I'd go more into detail but this review has like a character limit which is not visibly stated and want to fit the next two sections in as well...

The next RPG element is the game's random number generated loot which I somewhat find entertaining to play with after playing previous games with such a system, like Diablo and KOTOR (Knights of the Old Republic). So the loot gets randomly generated by some algorithm and you will get new surprise each time you open a loot box or when loot drops from an enemy... very exciting, isn't it? :P

I think that's about covered the gameplay section without rambling on too much? hahaha....

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Supports 7.1 discrete channels, though, unless it's a bug which 2K hasn't found out yet or was intended, there are areas where it would drop the 5.1 and go strereo only with 2.0 config. One such area is at Tannis' tent, all ambient noise would just cut off leaving only the front and right speakers working......another area is in T-Bone Junction...in various locations.... Too bad fraps can't record multi-channel audio under XP so I can't really gauge if it's actually discrete or really 5.1 discrete with two channels being created from the 6 channels discrete....like a 7.1 wide config where four speakers at the front and two rear plus sub. 

But yes, surround works at least and can hear foot steps or chatter behind you, to the side of you or and front....

[h1]Other notes (issues, complaints or otherwise)[/h1]
Hmmm, I guess I could start off with the arena DLC; why the hell is experience for killing enemies disabled?! hahahahaha They scale to you nicely and you get exp for reviving teammates and doing your challenge logs, but not exp for killing them?! I suppose it's probably to fit in with Moxxi's sadistic nature and play since she's one gets off whenever someone is in pain.....but still.....if you're gonna be heading that route, at least keep it consistent, damnit! hah..

The first step is 75 waves which comprises of 5 rounds of 5 waves each for 3 arena areas and then you have a bigger one which is 20 rounds of 5 waves each for three arena areas totaling 300 and in grand total 375 waves. The round gets reset back to 1 if you leave part way through incompleted. So you HAVE to stay through the entire arena run unless you're happy to re-do it from start again, just to make a reference, the long one takes at least 3 hrs to do one arena area, so be about 9 hrs minimum to do all three.... Sure you get loot drops every boss wave but they're only a few levels under your current chracter level which is pretty lame.... You also get a bank account where you can store your loot if you don't have enough inventory space for it and t

4468,haha xD
4469,"Weapons, explosions, elements, monsters, psychos ... What else do you need?"
4470,This game is fairly repetetiv and it offers no gamer skill development for me.
4471,"Great game. Fun Story, great characters."
4472,"A really amazing game. I remember when it first came out and I started it and just looked at the graphics, It was bad.. But also so good, It felt like I was in a cartoon. 

With the great into that really suckes you into the game, you feel like you are on an adventure.

When I started playing I quickly fell in love with many of the characters, I felt like I wanted to explore the world and every corner of the maps.

It's been some time since I have played it, but the memories of it are all good.
Replay value is not the biggest, except if you want to try the other characters or if you play the co-op part of the game.
Or if you are an achievement collector like me, then this game has some fun and great ones for you to get."
4473,"Boring. Played this for about an hour thinking the plot was going to start at some point, but this is literally how it plays:

1. Click on a mannequin NPC (apparently they're super-glued to the ground), hear a generic line of dialog
2. Read the quest description (it has no effect on the game) and click OK
3. Kill some THINGS and get some STUFF
4. Return said STUFF to the mannequin NPC who gave you the quest
5. Immediately get another quest where (you guessed it!) kill more THINGS and get more STUFF.

I get that this is from 2009, but GOTY? Seriously? Fallout 3 came out a year earlier and it's way better than this."
4474,.
4475,"How do I say it, Was worth my friends nagging me to get it. Fun as fuck I must say and have only played for 9 hours so far, I can't wait till I ""eventually"" make it to the end game becasue it looks like it will be a slog for sure. But this is one of those games that does a good job of making that slog fun as fuck. I can't wait to also play the rest after I have finished the rest. Ty Gearbox"
4476,"Fun, played longer with a console due to its local multiplayer"
4477,"Borderlands is a game with a worthwhile story, beautifully and carefully designed characters in a gorgeous semi-open world, following exciting PVE combat. You play as one of the four unique characters; Lilith the Siren, Brick the Beserker, Mordecai the Hunter, or Roland the Soldier. Each has their own ability and skill tree that you can play and use in a variety of combinations, equipt with guns that you can grind, buy, or find that also have a unique set of pros, cons, and ranks. Though I prefer the sequel to this game, this game in itself is still worth playing and completing as well as being a ton of fun."
4478,Great Game!
4479,"[h1] Bloodwing Attack! [/h1]

[b] What I Liked [/b]

The original, the classic, the Diablo FPS.  Great game, decent plot, and a ton of loot to be had.  The classes were great as well.  Sending out my bird to cause a loot explosion was some of the most fun I had in a Borderlands game.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

The only thing that got me was that the world felt very bland.  Nothing really stuck out to me.  But, despite that, I finished the game since it was so much fun to play and I was able to get a lot of sweet loot.  The end boss was disappointing as well.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

I beat it and I had my fill.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!"
4480,"I can recommend this game because it is usually fun. Emphasys on USUALLY as in NOT ALWAYS.
Pros:
+good character building
+complex, fun and engaging combat
+great art style
+good story
Cons:
-combat is sometimes repetitive in a boring way (you get to peak shit constantly)
-most of the bosses are easy and bad (can only be beaten with exploiting a spot or is waaaay too EZ. With Brick I once didn't notice the boss until I completed the quest. I had to go back to look for him to find out which enemy it was. It was a main boss...)
-you have to look at an object to pick it up
-you have to press e separately for everything when looting
-some characters' abilities are broken (Brick) some too unreliable and weak (Mordecai)

PLEASE NOTE THAT ID DIDN'T FINISH THE GAME"
4481,"Love it.:D

4482,its hawt
4483,A fantastic combination of FPS and RPG and a milestone of a game!
4484,"coolest game ever broh
"
4485,"Diablo with the FPS genre. That's the best way to sum up Borderlands. On one hand, I had a lot of fun doing the main quests, and gathering gear. On the other hand, the sidequests became a bit long and repetetive for my tastes. It also is lacking the humor of later titles from what I know.... but in my opinion that didn't bother me at all. Overall, it's a fun game, but it can get tedious at times if you do said sidequests.

Fun, yet flawed, like most videogames."
4486,"This is a great game with a wonderful story, interesting characters, and alien setting. If you enjoy shooting and looting this game is for you. Also, if you enjoy customization and upgrading your play style you will most likely enjoy this game. Lastly, if you do not like the character or the game becomes too hard try looking up a guide or changing your loadout or skills its most likely because your character is not built well for that challenge."
4487,One of the best Games ever made !
4488,we've got a lot to be thankful for thanks 2+
4489,Great game. They haven't improved the formula enough in the sequels but as the game that started it all this one takes the cake. I especially love Zombie Island which is still one of the best Zombie shooters on the market.
4490,great game ever
4491,"I was sceptical about the game when everyone was talking about it.
After I played it for 30 hours I can easily say that one of the best games out there and I havent even played the second one.
10/10 would reccomend."
4492,"Almost 10 years later, this is still an awesome game to pick up and mess around in."

Could pour more hours into this than Skyrim tbh"

4500,"A good game that you can complete very, very fast if u rush the main story, so if u have a litte patince u can do all the side quests which are quite fun at all."
4501,"Stupid game. Unable to progress at half of the first map. Run out of ammo, lost lots of money (around 5k) to revive, enemies level up as player levels up making them impossible to kill, crap weapons. Bottom line, I dislike it very much."
4502,The graphics gave me severe autism
4503,"Great Game. Played it after borderlands 2 and I really appreciated all the subtle differences between the two games. Great story, loot, and it is has definitely aged well graphics wise. Definitely recommend it."
4504,It's really fun and lots of lulz to play with your friends. But the story? Not too much..
4505,"Really bad gameplay extended over 40 hours. I'd rather play Half Life 2 5 times in a row. Game has bad gun mechanics, horrible movement, and brain dead ai. Pick up only if yuou're a loot fiend and that's the only thing you care about in games."

Whole lot of fun...so many hours sunken into this game!"

4510,my favorite game its really fun
4511,"While Gearbox's Borderlands is a fun hybrid title, it is difficult to retroactively review it since it has a superior sequel (Borderlands 2). Borderlands can only be fully experienced and enjoyed if you have friends to play with, otherwise, I would suggest holding off on playing it.

4513,"It's Borderlands, what else can I say? It's an instant classic!"
4514,"In comparison to the other Borderland games in the series, this in my opinion has a more balanced experienced. You get a great story with remarkable game play, and you will always have something to do. This has a lot of replay ability, and certainly caters towards people who like having a genuine almost mmo based system in the sense of a lot of questing, and ability to raid, while at the same time, allowing for those who do prefer a solo experience to have that in every respect. However, you will need to team up with people to obtain those amazing weapons. I do recommend this, it was a great experience, and I played this on console primarily, before getting a suitable pc which amplified the experience."
4515,"Borderlands is a good but old game from the series, the game that brought us borderlands 2 and Borderlands pre sequal.
Differences borderlands has between borderlands 2 and borderlands Pre Sequal:
-Eridian Artifacts that juice up your character's powers with Elemental powers 
-Health kits are items that you can carry in your intertory for when you need a healing boost.
-Some enemies don't appear in BL2 or Bl Pre sequal. 
-Weapon proficiency
-Borderlands 1 has a wastleland to explore theme, borderlands 2 has a bigger wasteland with robots theme, and Borderlands Pre sequal bandits in space!!!! 


Pros:
-A coop shooter game with leveling system and rng weapons and items.
-47 story missions and about 80 side missions to do.
-4 characters with their own powers and skill trees.
-The game gives off this wasteland feeling, that its you against the planet's dangers.
-A new game plus mode that makes enemies stronger and harder.
-Arena PVP
-Pop culture references
-Fun DLC with an arena mode PVE
-T.K Baha is a kind man
-Roland is still alive.

Cons:
-Al can be buggy sometimes
-doesn't have as many players as other borderlands games.
-Can feel old compared to the other games.
-Bosses can be lacking.
-Missons don't have voiceacting instead has text.
-Ending boss and ending leaves you with more questions than answers.
-Balancing can be a issue.
-T.K Baha dead.

Overall a nice game feels like borderlands 2 except it feels older and on a older engine and roland is still alive."
4516,"I know this game has been out for a while, but it has been a blast to play! Would definitely recommend to anyone!"
4517,"If youre expecting this to be like BL2 or BL:TPS, you're out of luck. But if you like story with mediocre gameplay, here it is. I picked this game up in the hopes that i would have fun gameplay and a good story just like BL2, but sadly only the story part was included. To be honest, I absolutely hated the gameplay and decided to refund this game because i was given no direction at the start and it felt like i was just grinding thru the quests waiting for something to happen, but in the time i did play it, nothing did happen.

Bottom line: Dont buy it if you're expecting it to be anything like BL2 or BL:TPS."
4518,"Very good base for the borderlands series

Completely different style of writing and gameplay than other borderlands games. Sets the foundations of the series, game could be  much better with some quality of life improvements but overall it's a decent to good looter shooter.

Replayability is a bit of an issue with challenges essentially not existing. Crawmerax is an excellent raid type end boss and a good way to finish your borderlands journey.

I suggest playing this with your friends, rushing through playthrough 1 and then enjoying the fun intricacies and dlc's during playthrough 2 where the difficulty is comparable to your gear and levels.

DLC's suffer from not having fast travels, performance issues and a bunch of other QOL problems. I found them really fun regardless of it's problems"
4519,"The first in the Borderlands series. Pretty old game. However compared to BL2 and BLTPS, the pacing is definitely different and the game is not polished to such a high level. It is to note that this game scales linearly. A level 60 and a level 62 wont have much difference. However in the other two games the difference can be immense. Due to this linear system guns tend to hold up longer when you progress to the higher levels.  

Skill trees do not have much options and the weapon choices are not as diverse and interesting when you compare it to BL2 and BLTPS. Movement is clunky and gunfeel does not feel as great. You mainly play this for the story. It's a fantastic game and it does not age as badly compared to other older games.  

Would recommend picking this game up purely for the story and also for it being somewhat different compared to BL2 and BLTPS."
4520,shooter
4521,Great game!
4522,One of the games that you need definitely to play. Really good missions and gameplay.
4523,"I look forward in spending more time with this although 2 is better, I still had fun playing this one"
4524,"This is quite the unique beast of a game!  RPG elements inside of a FPS where there are literally millions of different gun drops... it is just so much fun to replay again with friends, you gotta try it with some pals!"
4525,"This is the 3rd best of the Borderlands games including the Telltale one...
ITs still not a great video game with too much grinding long levels and a general lack of interesting content too keep one immersed within it or its world"
4526,"Really loved the game. game has a fanstastic story so far. played on xbox 360 and switched on pc. better cause it runs smother,"
4527,nice game great content
4528,"This is my favourite game of all time and the only game I have 100% on my Xbox before moving to PC, I recommend getting the GOTY edition as its has everything you need."
4529,"1. I take a job on the town notice board to clear some bandits.
2. I find those bandits and they shoot at me.
3. I shoot back. They lose.
4. I take their loot. I keep what I like. I sell what I don't.
5. I get paid for my ""troubles"" with money and experience.

- Why can't life be this fun?

Addictive.
 
From the straightforward, fun gameplay that doesn't take itself too seriously, to figuring out what to throw out to make room for the new weapon you just found, Borderlands is a wonderful example of a Casual RPG."
4530,cool
4531,"While its sequal improved on this game in most every way, the original Borderlands still has plenty to love about it with cell shaded graphics to make things pop, four interesting character classes to level up and unleash, plenty of well designed guns to choose from, and a plethora of diverse enemies for you to sink thousands of bullets into.

Although it might be a bit janky compared to today;s titles, this game still packs loads of fun with ts core game and the DLC missions attached."
4532,Fun choice :D
4533,"Don't let the cell-shaded animation fool you into believing this is a dated game... Not sure but I think they went that way to make the game able to handle EXTREMELY complex RPG combat computations.  It is the perfect match between first person shooter and RPG with an amazing amount of variety with weapons, shields and other powers making it replayable for years!"
4534,I quite enjoyed this. It's a little dated but truly an enjoyable kick-back and shootemup experience
4535,"Well ladies and gents lets have a word with todays loosers. Loaf what do you think about loosing the match.

4536,claptrap is actually huge
4537,its a good
4538,"Don't be fooled by my playtime. I have hundreds of offline hours and THOUSANDS on Playstation/XBOX.

This game stands the test of time. Borderlands 2 has more polish, but honestly I don't think that's a better thing in this case. Borderlands has an aura of mystery and exploration that the sequels just can't compete with. You are a treasure hunter. That's your only motivation. And by golly is there treasure to be found.

A classic, simple rpg system, a fun cast of characters with some great writing, and the perfect gun/loot system. It may not have the flashing lights and signature weapon styles of it's younger brother, but this game is by far the best Borderlands, hands down."

4541,The grandfather of FPS. We wouldn't be knee deep in CoDs if it wasn't for this game.
4542,Very old game but I love borderlands and enjoy playing the first one.
4543,this game is awesome. nothing more to say
4544,10/10 game borderlands and my personal favorite game. This game is amazing from all millions of guns to collect to the fun campaign. I have over 1k hours on this game over all my accounts that should tell u how good this game is
4545,My most favorite game playing with my wife. We finished the title and the DLCs so many times and still keep playing
4546,"A very fun game, a tad repetitive at times but the focus isn't really the story, it's the loot hoarding and exp earning that makes it fun."
4547,"One of the best games I have played in a long time, 100% recommended."
4548,"Shitty difficulty.
Wrong task hint."
4549,Quality Game
4550,"One of the best games I have played in a long time, 100% reccomended"
4551,"Spent many hours on this game by myself and with my friends as well.

Single player is a not too hard if you don't try to engage higher level enimies, which are a little more approachable in multiplayer, since you can help your team mates. There are lots of quest and good settings, even if the drops are sometimes poor and not very precise in descripitions. The mechanics work fine, and you will find only few bugs (and not always) if you don't intend to exploit any game defect.

If you play as Mordecai, the Hunter, you will probably see soon that Bloodwind Behaviour could had been optimized, which is the only thing that a few times can make you hate your own character. 

Most builds work easly in Normal Mode, but in the second run you might need to respec your skills if you were not following any good reasonable logic build. Bosses are fun and funny, but some normal mobs are actually way too much repetitive (but well, that's an RPG after all). 

Only real (almost) pain in the ass is the FOV, which is way too low if you are used to most FPS games, but it's an issue easly fixable with a little patience. Personally I did not change it anyway.

I would strongly recommend this game to whoever did not try it yet, it's very peculiar in its genre.  If you like RPGs and FPSs this is a must-buy. I would also recommend to play it in a party. The more you are the funnier it is."
4552,"Borderlands, in my opinion, is a very fun, co-op game. One of the reasons that it is fun is because each character has its own uniqe traits and special ability, for example, Brick's special ability is ""Berserk"" which makes him only able to do melee attacks but they are as strong, actually stonger, than any gun, exept maybe some pearlescents that Crawmerax drops. Also if you find an artifact and use it your action skill deals that type of elemental damage. There are 4 different classes, the berserker, which I was, the hunter, which my dad was, the siren, and the soldier, which my cousin and my uncle were. Up to 4 characters can join in this co-op game and you can have multiple people using the same class in the same game. It's not just a game like call of duty where you keep on dying and respawning, you have an actual chance to live in the game. I also think borderlands has an amazing and interesting storyline. If you complete the storyline that's not the end of the game, you can start playthrough 2 and the enemies will be a higher level. There's also not just like 10 types of enemies like minecraft, there's just about thousands of different classes of enemies and bosses and different varieties of normal enemies. All the DLCs have a very interesting storyline too, exept Moxxi's underdome, which is an arena and arenas obviusly don't have a storyline. The zombie island of dr. ned has the most interesting storyline out of all the DLCs. The secret armoury of  general knoxx was my favorite DLC. Everything including the DLCs have and main storyline and side-quests(exept moxxi's underdome riot). That's my review on Borderlands and its DLCs, I would like to write a lot more, but I think I've writen enough for you to get my general idea of Borderlands. Bye!"
4553,"This is the definition of ""The journey is more important than the destiny"""
4554,best fps rpg of all time
4555,"My first severals hours were amazing. I was having a lot of fun. Then the performance issues started, making the game unplayable. After trying reading many threads, trying different fixes, game settings, file updates, nVidia control panel settings, I could not fix the issues. I have a nice rig, too."
4556,Great looting fun Diablo-style!
4557,"Not even close to the games that followed, but still a good game. Get it on a deal and you’ll have a good old time."
4558,"I didn't like the game for what it was when it came out back in 2007, but I'm having lots of fun with it now. Fast-pased FPS gameplay coupled with an ARPG-style loot system offer much joy even in single player, more so in a team. The environment lacks the diversity in this first installment of the series, however, all these wastelands and scrapyards are so neatly designed it makes them still look good. Not a huge variety of enemies either, but you do need different tactics for different types of them... well, either this or a really powerful gun capable of solving all your problems at once :) The plot ending in a huge cliffhanger (at least the main campaign, still have two DLCs to go excluding the arena-based one I'm not so excited about) is rather simple and bland, but quests description and occasional dialogues (or, rather, monologues posed by NPCs before our hero of choice who's mostly silent) are quite fun and generally well-written. The game rarely takes itself seriously but in a good way, you'll find tons of references at every step - Mad Max and Fallout ones as the most obvious, but you'll also come across some pointing to Diablo and other games, various books, films/TV series, historical events and characters, there's even a place for an occasional 4th wall breaking and mocking over the genre's cliches. That's probably the best part of this game for me that really keeps you captivated and looking forward to what else you may discover, although it will probably lose a good bit of its polish in the following playthroughs. Still, a very decent FPS/RPG game that plays good even after its sequels"
4559,"Good game, one of my personal favorites."
4560,its a fun fps with some rpg elements
4561,"I love this game it is so fun not the best Grafics but it works great on a crappy laptop
"
4562,10/10 would recommend
4563,"love this game cant stop playing it want to play other games but when i open steam this is where i end up 
"
4564,Good
4565,"It's like Borderlands 2, but more boring."
4566,"I love Borderlands. Great time passer, good challenge & so on."
4567,TK Baha best waifu fam
4568,i played for 7 minutes to listen to cage the elephant then closed it
4569,"do like this game alot and do reccomend it but its so tedious just to level and kill the same monsters once re-spawning from another area or even during the game which does make it so annoying but apart from that great gameplay and nice graphics and music is cool, also works well with a controller for the frist game :)"
4570,"I'm kind of on the fence whether to recommend this game or not, but i did have a bit of fun playing it so i will give it a thumbs up. There are a few things i did like and some things i didn't like about this game. It all depends on what type of games you like, but this one had a futuristic type of gameplay to it. it kind of reminded me of the fallout genre except fallout was way better. I will run through the pros and cons of the game below.

Pros:

- Plenty of missions and stuff to do.
- Tons of guns to choose from.
- Big map/areas
- Graphics are unique and look decent.
- Many different kind of enemies.

Cons:

- Way too much ammo laying around.
- The saving system is horrible. You kill enemies and they all return to the same area.
- Enemies that are the same level as you are way too powerful.
- You can get stuck in lots of places on the map.
- This game has some of the worst bullet reg i've ever seen.
- The ending is a let down."
4571,nice game
4572,Best Game
4573,Really fun shooter to play with friends.
4574,Great game even in 2017. well worth the price
4575,"Borderlands.

See a pile of Skagg turds? Punch it for goodies!

See a Skagg? Punch it for goodies!

See a mob? Punch them for goodies!

See your car get stuck? Punch it over!

Unless you're like... Roland or something, then you can just throw things."
4576,"Alright, so I've been playing it nonstop since I picked it up, and basically... it's bada**. The shooting mechanics are perfect, and the guns all vary so greatly. It's like Fallout (3) but with a more perfected first-person blend with the RPG genre. I wouldn't say the quality of the storyline is anywhere near that of Fallout, but the action certainly compares, and quite often wins. The presentation is probably my favorite aspect of the game. The characters and creatures are all so unique and awesome that you pretty much have to experience it first hand to understand. 

Did I mention there are a LOT of guns? K, there's a LOT of guns, allowing you to fine tune your gun to your personality. I've grown attached to a certain handgun, assault rifle, and shotgun, personally. As for the missions, I can't say they're different from what you've done before, but I can this game takes what has been done and does it incredibly well. Mark my words, you'll want to keep playing once you start it, and you will have fun, you will laugh, and you will want to experience it with some friends. The split screen works well, and it, also, is really fun.

From what I've played so far, I'm 99% sure that I want to keep playing til the sun comes up; but lo and behold, college waits for no one..."
4577,It soooo boring play with your own self. I regret bought this game. I dunno why it has overwhelmingly positive review.
4578,pretty boring game play at best tps is some how better then this game. main story is pretty much not there knox and claptrap dlc have the most story out of the game moxxi underdome is just crap 5 rounds of 5 waves of boring npcs that just stand across the map waiting for you to run over there and then half the run across the map again making it just a waste of time. and this has to be done 3 times. dr ned dlc is pretty boring and pointless as well. game plays a lot worse compared to tps and the second borderlands title. not worth the money for this game as its pretty boring and not much of a story line.
4579,Best RPG and FPS game combo!! :)
4580,"A nice and interesting game that hooked me from the start however as it progressed it lost some of its' magic. The premiss is captivating but the way they chose to tell the story (through texts) or the lack of lore made me lose focus. I mean, you are stranded one a far away planet filled with aliens and bandits looking for this ancient secret treasure and you have no idea about what's going on. Just that begining made me want to play the second the game, however that feeling quickly faded away due the amount of hours playing without getting enough rewarding content. I wanted to know more about the planet, this ancient vaults, the characters, etc... The end... ohh the end... i just.. Not memorable. Feels like one more normal mission but this time is a little bit bigger. It was disappointing.

I will now play the second one and i hope they solved some of this problems. 


6,5/10 Good game it's a shame it didn't live up to the expectations it build from the start. However do buy it, it's worth its price and it leads to Borderlands 2.

Update:

Since i've done the review i had the chance to play the dlc's so here goes the review for them as well.

First DLC: The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned

I think that the devs heard the people cry when the game came out and they fixed the problems i've talked about before in the dlc's. For instance this time there are cutscenes without affecting the quick pace and funny aspect of the game. Besides that, believe it or not, the story of this dlc is far more interesting than the one from the game... Maybe because of that interaction with the player, I don't know. Somehow i got hooked from the start to find out the evil scheme of Dr. Zed, sorry Dr. Ned... whatever.

8/10 A must play if you liked the main game.

Second DLC - Mad Moxxy Underdome Riot

Well, this one is not as interesting as the last one. Maybe because it's just countless hords of enemies comming in your way and you killing them all. You will spend hours, not kidding, hours inside an area just to pass 1 challenge of the dlc. There's not a big story there, besides you trying to become Mr. Moxxy. Certainly not enough to get me through the entire DLC. I quit after i completed 3 arenas and saw that it wasn't going anywhere...

3/10 Bad, dull, not worth your time and money. If it comes with ""the package"" great, you can go there time to time and enjoy some random shooting however buying this alone? No thanks..."
4581,Yes
4582,"Good game, but it feels like it ends prematurely. Borderlands 2 is where the franchise really hits its stride."
4583,"Thumbs Up, Like the style,(Yes!) the humor....the Borderlands. A bit too long, and ""uniform"" for my taste. Love the zombi DLC thou. 
I rate it: Just above medium +"
4584,really fun game when you are with friends
4585,REVIEW
4586,is good 7/10 cuz mulitplayer sucks and needs more players
4587,yeah nah :)
4588,"Borderlands is a FPS/RPG hybrid game set on a lawless planet called Pandora and promises great co-op gameplay, lots and lots of guns and insane fun. But how does it fare? This is what I think of Borderlands. 

This game is one of my favourite games of all time. I've had a blast playing it on multiple platforms over the years and I can honestly say there is no game quite like it. Despite being a little light on story, the crazy characters you meet along the way, the hilarious humour of the game and the fantastic gameplay make this an unforgettable experience. And there's the guns of course. Mountains and mountains of guns. Borderlands also has a very unique art style. I remember when I saw an early preview and they were going for generic realism. I'm so glad they changed it to cel-shaded graphics. Not only is it unique, but it makes it stand out even after all this time. It has been done since, but not quite as well.

The story begins with you entering the small town of Fyrestone via bus, as one of four mercenaries. Each have different skill trees and active skills and are each unique. You have Roland, the soldier who can deploy a turret to fight with him. Lilith is a siren, a sexy magic wielding maniac. You have Mordecai, who has his own pet bird that helps him in fights. Last but not least is Brick, a huge slab of meat who can punch things really hard. Probably plays bingo on a Tuesday. Each starts with a different weapon type but each character can use what they like. You start getting visions from a mysterious woman who guides you on your quest to find the Vault, an alien treasure trove said to contain untold riches, powers and other earthly wonders. Who wouldn't want to to find that, eh? The story essentially is a journey across Pandora, meeting the eccentric locals and shooting most people in the face in search of the Vault. Good times.

The gameplay is fantastic in this game. With several types of weapon to choose from, you shoot and loot your way across Pandora, picking up all kinds of great weaponry with many different effects. Some are elemental, shocking, burning and melting foes, others include things like a shotgun that fires rockets. It's crazy, it's bonkers and it's brilliant. You can play solo or with up to three buddies, both are a very good time indeed. Each character has their own skill trees, as said above, and you can mix and match depending on your playstyle. It's well worth a playthrough with each one to experience what each character offers. 

It's the humour in this game that makes it stand out. It doesn't take itself too seriously and is a hilarious time. Pop culture references galore await within and rare is the time in game when you don't have a smile on your face. Few games are ever this funny, and it knows it. The characters are weird and memorable, especially Scooter and Tannis. Fantastic stuff. Pandora itself is a great setting, providing you with the danger of a lawless planet with bandits around every corner and the wildlife trying to eat you when your back is turned. 

The game also has some terrific DLC. The first, the Zombie island of Dr Ned, tasks you with traveling to a secluded island overrun with zombies. Back when zombies were still relatively fresh before being in pretty much every game ever for about two years, it's a great time. Mad Moxxi's Underground Riot is a bit of dud, but the other two, The Secret Armory of General Knoxx and Claptrap's New Robot Revolution, add hours of fun to the base game and are fantastic additions.

There aren't many negatives to point out, other than the slightly under-baked story and the quests rarely evolve past simple ""go here and shoot this"" variety but you'll be having so much fun with the gameplay you probably won't notice it too much. It's a lot more fun playing with friends but as a lone wolf myself, it is more than good enough solo. It doesn't have the longevity of the sequel though, as you can't reset challenges in order to continue having things to do and increasing Badass Rank. Why they didn't remaster this with the other two and put the Badass system in I don't know. 

Overall, like I said before, this game is one of a kind and one of my favourite games ever. Eclipsed by the sequel, this is nevertheless a fantastic game and is a ride you won't want to miss out on. If you still haven't picked up this bonkers game yet, you owe it to yourself to play it. Strap yourself in for a wild ride, and embrace the madness."
4589,"The famous looter shooter. Looks good for its age, but behind a cute and playful cel-shaded veneer hides a genuinely poor PC port. Some of the problems(like low FOV and general lack of options) can be fixed via third party tools. But being a single-threaded UE3 game, Borderlands doesn't run too well in some places, no matter how powerful your PC is. This problem is exaggerated for those who don't own an Intel CPU, for the engine is clearly optimised for the blue team.

But it doesn't mean that it can't bring dozens of hours of joy. Fully beating the SP campaign and all DLC could easily take up to 50 hours, not to mention the new game+ for those who really enjoy the core gameplay loop. As an FPS it is unremarkable - gunplay is meh at best, only remedied by the gun variety. But the constant progression and acquisition of a of better loot are what ultimately makes the experience. Definitely worth trying to determine whether or not you'd want to dive in the franchise further - there's a lot more if you like this one."
4590,"A great return to tradition of fighting bosses and getting XP and loot rewards, this time with guns!"
4591,"Back when it was released, we teamed up with a local buddy of mine, and spent like 1.5k hours in this game, looking back at those times, this is still one of my favourites. The artwork of Borderlands is magnificent, the gameplay smooth, all the characters are likeable in their own way. The variety of weapons can make it a challenge to get yourself something you really like, or just to beat anything that you have to face."
4592,"When I first looked at the game many years ago, it didn't impress me at all. I didn't see how it would stand out from the rest, and the cartoon-like screenshots were rather off-putting at the time.

Then someone I care about essentially pushed me to add it to my wishlist. I got the game as part of a Humble Bundle, and it's only now in 2017 that we got to play it.

Despite the outdated graphics, poor surround sound mixing, FOV and ultrawide issues, I was still blown away by the game. It was like a first-person version of Diablo, set in a Fallout-style rusty wasteland. The main locations were really large and led to even more ""dungeons"", as in many regular role-playing games. The weapons were unique due to their randomly generated stats. The soundtrack fit the game. The enemies were fun to kill. The main storyline wasn't hard to follow and the Claptraps were really memorable. The small humorous bits were humorous indeed!

I can't remember the last time before Borderlands that I wanted to push every other game aside and go back to playing just one, day after day. It did it for me."
4593,good game
4594,"Diablo-style looting has even the FPS-phobic me having fun, but there are a number of jumping puzzles required to scavenge certain gun parts.  Precision platforming puzzles have never worked well in any first-person game, but Borderlands commits the unforgivable sin of sometimes punishing you by causing you to get stuck in scenery (requiring a full reset!), or even killing you outright for going outside the ""acceptable"" borders.  (See what I did there?)  That glaring flaw drops an otherwise 9 to an even 8.  Recommended, but with caveats.  8/10."
4595,"Thank you for riding the Psycho Express, Toot-toot! All aboard, I'll be collecting your tickets, we have beverages in the DINING CAR!!!"
4596,the game aged well
4597,"I suspect that this is much bteer in co-op, but as a solo game it's pretty terrible. ""Diablo with guns"" is a brilliant idea, but the framework here is just super boring. I hope Borderlands 2 is an improvement."
4598,"It's fun playing with friends.. but I often play alone, and online server does not seem to work, anymore."
4599,"Generic FPS
Jumping is your only way of defending, and jumping in this game is bad.
Skill means little, you just need to be of the appropriate level.
Ennemy attacks are not commited, they can hit you 360° even after initiate.
HP sponge in your face rush...
Etc ...

Still some fun can be found, starting around level 20-25. For the price you have some insurance to always have an opportunity to shoot at stuff indefinately."
4600,"Played it when it first came out, I want to say I was in highschool at the time. Played BL2 and the Pre-Sequel with my roommates way too much in college too. I don't think I actually ever played the expansions of BL1 though so it's nice to be able to get all of them with the game for only $29.99 and I'm really enjoying the nostalgia. Most of my friends don't play PC unfortunately so if anyone's looking to play some co-op let me know."
4601,"This game is epicly fun, and if you're purchsing it, GET THE DLC. This game has great graphics for its time and today's standards, hours of gameplay, badass guns, badass bosses, badass story, and did I mention guns?"
4602,"This game is absolutely brilliant. I started playing Borderlands 2 and decided that it would be better if I started with the first one to learn the systems. I've beaten Borderlands once solo, and once co-op, and am finally on to the second now. Very addictive, and a high level of replay value. I wish that guns were craftable and moddable, as you may find a great gun that fits your play style that eventually becomes too weak, and you'll be forced to discard it and use something less fitting. Other than that, it's definitely worth a couple of playthroughs."
4603,the game has a lot of walking/driving back and forth through the same areas at times so I'd recommend playing while listening to your favorite music and ideally with a friend. other than that it's a really fun game.
4604,"This game is Fallout: New Vegas without Fallout or New Vegas.

There are lots of weapons, the enemies scale up with you, and you're going to be walking around in a desert for most of the game."
4605,"An absoluetly wonderful game filled with content, joy, sillyness and L O O T. The story of the game isn't in the focus, which isn't a big problem because the player will never focus on that section of the game's image. This is an RPG/FPS styled game with 4 main characters (you can choose one of them to play with) and every character has got an unique skill which will vary the gameplay and the style of the playthrough. I could be talking about how amazing this Borderlands title is, but I won't waste anyone's time, if you want to laugh, destroy and obliterate hordes of enemies, this game is for you. Do not hesitate, buy it now, you won't regret it."
4606,"Borderlands is pure raw fun. Stylewise it's a FPS that meets Diablo. Endless weapons types, multiple quests and side quests, character advancement RPG-like but fairly simple and quick to grasp.

Atmosphere is perfectly set, the sarcastic tone used goes perfectly along with the visual shaders used, creating a grim cartoony style with a lot of Tarantino feeling to it.

Maps are great and wide, a very good variety of areas and settlements. Enemies might not be an endless variety but they level up and use different weapons, and that creates combinations of pain for every taste and flavour.

Quick and sharp, the gameplay is good, didn't find any bug this far. Looking forward to finish it and get to Borderlands 2 at some point, I am hooked on it! I still have to try the multiplayer, i've been told is a world of fun by many friends."
4607,"50 Hours and Counting, Really good game, good graphics, good gameplay. Just play it!"
4608,Classic
4609,"Majority of the whole game's content, characters, story and interactions with npcs is like something you might dream about after taking bunch of melatonin pills."
4610,Just started this game :) Kind of hooked xD
4611,"Though it's old and it's successors Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequal are much better, it's still a fun and I guess somewhat ""classic"" FPS game. If you want to play the events before Pre-Sequal and 2, get it."
4612,"Super-fun rps game with lots of guns and entertaining shooting, if you like realism this isn't for you. Reminds me a little bit of Bioshock in terms of enemies, but it is a looting game at heart. Recommend if you like shooting people and taking their money and guns, watch out for TK's Wave"
4613,"I guess this isn't for me? Didn't like the repeating landscape and rather boring GUI. I've been told of it's theoretically great DLC, but I can't be bothered to get that far. The guns handle lik nerf darts or cannons and there is no inbetween. Of course this all I can get from the start of the game but the start of a game should properly display the mechanics and ongoings inside."
4614,"Stopped working after Windows 10 Creators Fall update. Crashes with General Protection Fault. Compatibility settings don't help.

UPD: Followed the steps https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/203314696--PC-Borderlands-crashing-when-opened .
Then reinstalled NVIDIA PhysX.
SOLVED."
4615,Probably the only game I've played with non-boring and pointless side missions.
4616,"And so, a legend was born..."
4617,"First off I'd like to say that borderlands is a great game, I just can't recommend purchasing it through steam. I bought the game expecting it to run fine since my pc specs are more than enough to handle it, however I keep experiencing random heavy fps drops and stuttering. I spent several hours trying to fix it, and was denied a refund because of this. After doing some research I've found several others with the same issue, with no fix."
4618,"I have beat this game 3 times, and am playing again with my wife. Great shooter with a fun twist."
4619,"This game has not stood the test of time. In comparison to it's sequel and the presequel, it is just a mess. I cant not recommend it because the story is good, and the combat works. But its broken and buggy and it looks terrible. It's a 5.5-6.5/10"
4620,"Well, despite looking like an extremely bland looking shooter with cel-shaded rendering on the top of it, the game has actually managed to hook me for more than 27 hours. The lootbox system(*ahem* *cough* cough*) is the main attraction here, and the weapons, which are the only things you get out of them besides ammo and money, there seems to be no end to it. It was the first proper fps-rpg hybrid that had actually enjoyable shooting and it embraced what rests at the core of a shooting game, a gun. A big fucking gun. So hunt for one and keep shooting. Do not mind the bland world with nothing to be seen anywhere, it is supposed to be like that. Once you start getting good guns you'll stop noticing that."
4621,"The type of comedy a lot of games are missing these days, what you'd get if the mother of RPGs had an orgy with a bunch of Shooter daddy's. A post-apocalyptic setting that any ""down to earth"" person would love calling home. Not too repetitive, good replayability, and to top it all of, you can choose how to dispose of everything that moves. Simple fun. For everyone."
4622,"The gameplay sometimes is really intense which I liked it. Gamers may need to pace it well to get the best out of the game. I know this is a big game and may take huge amount of to finish, so spaced by game sessions to ensure I dont get bored of the gunplay.
The visuals and gameplay are nice. The sound tracks are strictly OK. I will recommend this game to casual gamers."
4623,Awesome game! Just finished my 1st playthrough and now excited to do the DLC.
4624,"after 30 hours... i cleared all mission in original game. i have all dlc packs but im not gonna touch these. let me tell why i dont recommend this game. first, the map system is so bad. every 5 sec, i have to click map key for searching destination. if producer put minimap on the game, it would be more convenient. in addition. you cant find mission object sometimes 
 with maps. map give you where the objects are but the objects can be in the air or under ground. so you have to consider every direction. second, not enough rpg system. this is FPS 'RPG' game, but your character have  an action skill and a few passive skills. third, this game makes you run long distance everytime when you have missions. seriously, i almost slept cuz i have to run long long long way for destination. However, this game is good at action. about shoting and killing, it was the best."
4625,I love borderlands but buying it on steam is a real gamble. My copy doesn't work and I haven't found a fix for it yet.
4626,"First and foremost, I can only recommend this game if you have someone else to play it with, otherwise it's just a boring game that leaves me feeling unsatisfied.

Borderlands is a first-person shooter with RPG elements, including a leveling system and, ""multiple guns,"" with varying stats. 

The main appeal of the game is to, ""shoot and loot."" Which brings the question; why play the game? The story makes an effort, but at the end of the day, it doesn't have a big enough hook to make me want to play. The (stolen) cell-shaded art style is (not really) unique, but every area looks the same with all of the colors blending into a lot of brown, yellow, and red. Just look at the logo of the game and that's basically all you're gonna see. The best looking area in the game is the last level, which finally gives your eyes a break with a change of scenery.

The leveling system keeps the game interesting for the most part, as it really does feel like your level makes a difference; although, there isn't much of a challenge in this entire game. Everything flows really smoothly, with no huge difficulty spikes or even tough enemies. This adds to the reason I feel the game is boring; enemies are too easy. To have any sense of challenge in this game, you have to purposefully fight something multiple levels above you, which goes against all sense of logic in a RPG.

I put, ""multiple guns,"" in quotes earlier because they're really just copy and pasted guns with slightly different stats or a elemental effect added to it. The reality is there's only about ten different guns in the game, but thousands of those guns are in the world with a different color scheme. Not really sure why they tried so hard to make that a selling point.

The problem is that nothing in Borderlands feels ambitious. It seems like they wanted to make a cooperative game without having to put too much thought into it, and while there are fun moments, the game is just too repetitive to keep me satiated."
4627,It's was awesome.
4628,The characters are extremly creative and funny
4629,It's fun and challenging. Grinding might be a good idea but YOLO is the best way the do missions!!
4630,Honestly I have had this game for ages on Xbox 360 finished it a multitude of times and I cant recommend it enough. Still has the best humour of the whole series.
4631,"This is a very entertaining FPS with cartoon style art design.  What sets it aside from other shooters is the looting system that creates random weapons that you find or can buy.

It is bloody but humorous with lots of game play, missions, even vehicles!

Since you can now often get this one on the cheap, it is definitely worth grabbing...I personally did not get it when all the hype was happening, so even as it has aged, it is an enjoyable game!

ACHIEVEMENTS:  I am working on them, but they all seem doable over time.

4632,"its really good,not as good as borderlands 2 but still pretty good,deffenatly worth geting"
4633,"I can understand why some disagree but I think this game has aged well. The only real issue is that you (not guaranteed, but it happens on a lot of systems) will slowly get fewer and fewer frames per second the longer the game is open. This can get very frustrating. However, I'd still recommend it to anyone. Kinda like a dungeon crawler mixed with a shooter. One of my all time favorites. And the vast majority of the time i've spent was on the 360 so it's many more than on here."
4634,It's pretty good.
4635,"so much fun!!

play it with friends to have more fun!!!!!!!!!!"
4636,Not as good as Borderlands 2 but still a great game
4637,The game is a loot FPS Game with skill trees and Quests with little story and does get boring over time ....
4638,"Love this game so much ♡, so cool, good weapons, lots of way to farm, great plot ♡

Amazing game to spend time with friends killing some bad guys  /o/"
4639,"First off, my hours played isn't even entirely accurate seeing that I have plenty of hours in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions as well. Second off, this is easily one of my favorite video games. 

I can see why some would be against this game, but those are likely people who started on Borderlands 2 and decided to try the first one. However, I used to play this game before the second one even existed so that isn't a problem for me. While I also have hundreds of hours in Borderlands 2, there's just something unique about this game that pulls me back once in a while. It's definitely more unique in general compared to most games I have played. While it's not a game for everyone, I for one have certainly enjoyed the countless hours spent in this awesome game."
4640,"EDIT: Minor clean-up.

This is a first-person shooter role-playing game, marketed as a ""role-playing shooter"" back when it was released. While not the first of its kind, it started the huge FPS-RPG trend we have today.

The game begins with your arrival on Pandora, a forsaken mining planet. When the local wildlife emerged from years of hibernation, the planet became unmanageable, and the corporations cut their losses and left. Now it's a wasteland of ghost towns, bandits, and monsters. A legend about The Vault, a lost treasure trove of alien technology, draws adventurers called ""Vault Hunters"" in search of fortune and glory. A mysterious message and a funny little robot soon point you in the right direction...

Mordecai, Lilith, Roland, and Brick are the playable Vault Hunters you can choose from. Each has 21 skills available in a skill tree system, plus a special Action Skill unique to their class. Other than that, they can all use the same gear except for Class Mods, which give bonuses to skills and other abilities. Mordy is a Hunter with an alien pet named Bloodwing. Lilith is a Siren with alien powers, who can Phasewalk in an invulnerable spirit form in short bursts. Roland is a Soldier with a robotic Scorpio Turret he can deploy to provide cover and support. Brick is a Berserker, who can use a Berserk rage to deliver powerful punches and heal rapidly. Each skill tree has three branches, allowing you to customize your play style, and you can fully ""respec"" (recover all your skill points from the skill tree and invest them differently) at any New-U save point.

A central feature of the game is the loot system, which mimics dungeon crawler games like Diablo and Torchlight. Items like weapons, equipment, etc. are ""procedurally generated"" by randomly combining properties from internal charts and tables. This generates a wide variety of possible items with different abilities each time. The game is said to have millions of possible guns, and other items and enemies are also varied in this way to some extent. Not only can you find this stuff in chests and buy it from vending machines (yes, this world has gun vending machines) but enemies can carry it as well, and enemies that use items can use it against you.

Controls are pretty standard for an FPS game, mouse/keyboard is WASD by default but everything is easily rebound in the options menus. Press left mouse button to fire your current gun, hold right mouse button to aim down the sights (or use a scope if your gun has one) which improves your accuracy but limits you to walking speed. Mouse wheel cycles weapons. I ended up binding melee, grenades, and Action Skill to mouse buttons since I use these a lot. Reload isn't something you should worry about rebinding as long as Activate is bound to something convenient, as you can Reload with your Activate key whenever you're not facing a usable item. Holding the Activate key when picking up ammo, money, and health vials will vacuum up all of them within a few feet, holding it when picking up a gun or shield will equip it on you instantly. Your target reticle shows where your shots will go, based on weapon accuracy and recoil.

You have little Health in the beginning of the game, but the tutorial missions in the first town let you buy a Shield belt which can absorb damage, and will begin to recharge after a few seconds of not getting hit. Better types of Shield become available later, and some Shields and Class Mods can buff or regenerate Health as well. You can have two weapons, a Shield, a Class Mod, and a Grenade Mod equipped, and have 12 backpack slots in your Storage Deck for loot. Two more weapon slots unlock much later, and 30 extra backpack slots can be gotten from Claptrap robots you rescue along the way.

Losing all your Health doesn't kill you immediately. Instead you fall down and enter ""Fight For Your Life"" where you can only turn and attack, while your view sways drunkenly and a timer runs down. If you kill an enemy you get a ""Second Wind"" which gives you a little Health and full Shield, and returns you to the fight. Failing to get a Second Wind in time (or getting hit by a vehicle or falling off the map) respawns you at the nearest New-U checkpoint instead. This costs you a small percentage of your money, and in solo play it returns your enemies to full health, but that's about it. This encourages run-and-gun over playing the game like a cover shooter, since it's hard to hit anything in FFYL beyond close range, making it more useful in close quarters battle.

You soon get ""elemental"" weapons that can inflict Explosive, Fire, Shock, or Corrosive damage. Higher tech weapons have higher chances to inflict more damage over time. There are also Grenade Mods, which give your hand grenades elemental damage types and/or new features: From cluster bombs and proximity mines, to transfusion grenades that release a swarm of homing darts to steal health from your enemies.

You get the ability to summon vehicles from any Catch-A-Ride station early in the game, and these are useful for exploring the huge outdoor maps. Vehicle weapons are awkward, but running things over is fun. Each vehicle can seat two, and you can have two vehicles at once, so the whole team can ride together in multiplayer. There's an auto-aim system for the turret if you don't have a partner to operate it. If they get blown up or stuck somewhere, you can spawn more for free. Vehicles are relatively easy to flip over with your hands or melee attacks if you find your car upside down. The driving controls and physics are not great, but it's OK for something that isn't a driving game.

This game is more for co-op play than solo. Up to four players can work together, and some types of Class Mod give bonuses that help the entire team. You can also revive a downed teammate by holding Activate on them for a few seconds, giving them a Second Wind without them having to score a kill in FFYL. You can drop guns and gear for them from your backpack, and any cash picked up is added to everybody's balance, but guns and other loot must be shared. There are a few class skills that help other characters in various ways, but you don't really need perfect teamwork. In the context of a shooter game, I see this as an advantage: Since most of the ways you can help your team are passive, you can better focus on the action.

You only get rewards for completing missions if you're at about the same point in the main quest as the host or beyond them, but still find money and loot normally. However, because of the way difficulty and loot are scaled, a player too far behind will be useless and get loot they can't equip yet, and a player too far ahead will overpower everything but will get junk loot. If you're serious about co-op, it's best to play with a regular group, so that you advance at about the same rate and experience the missions together.

The cel-shaded comic book art style has aged pretty well, and the Road Runner cartoon desert environment is charming and works way better than it should. The twangy music does a good job of setting the mood, and the sound effects are of satisfying quality. There's some great voice work, and bizarre supporting characters who appear as questgivers, although the player characters mostly just have witty combat banter and such. The ""space western"" setting and cynical humor work together nicely. There are a few dramatic moments, but the story doesn't take itself too seriously.

Minor gripes: The loot system has a bit of a ""+1% Pointlessness"" problem, where it often creates items with attributes that make a barely noticeable difference in practice. A glitch related to deleted missions can break multiplayer matchmaking. There are a few unique weapons with gimmicks that make them awkward to use, a few bullet sponge bosses, and other game-isms.

Overall, I had lots of fun with this, in singleplayer and multiplayer, and I recommend it to FPS fans and RPG fans alike."
4641,10/10 would reveiw again
4642,"Think Borderlands 2, but with more of a ""I guess this is happening now"" feel to it and the guns feel like they have more weight to them. Wait, I shouldn't use a sequel to describe the original?"
4643,Amazing game
4644,"Great game, only con is the FOV :("
4645,"Unbelievable game!!! Didn't really like the look or sound of it to be honest but got it as part of a Humble Bundle, so gave it a go one day when I had nothing else to play...and wow!...what a game this is, absolutley loved the Zombie Island of Dr Ned. And Clap Trap is awesome, had me lol loads of times...which is why I have nominated this game for the The “Soul Of Vitruvius” Award :-)"
4646,"Good fucking game, I rate"
4647,I have loved borderlands since it released way back when and it still to this day makes me happy
4648,"It may not be perfect. It might not be ""as good as the sequel."" It might actually just be a tech demo for a weapon generation system with a hastily-made game slapped on top of it. But that doesn't stop Borderlands from being one of my favorite games of all-time. Do you like to shoot? Do you like to loot? If so, get Borderlands. And the sequel. And the pre-sequel. (See what I did there?)
Also modding is a thing. You want MORE guns? MORE maps? The community has you covered."
4649,"The original, and quite frankly, still the best in my eyes. My and my best friend play a lot of co-op storyline games together and I think we can both agree this is in the Top 3, if not 1st place on our list of games. Quirky, fun, the game is a hell of a blast, BL2 and Pre-Sequel are of course more updated, but I believe this to have the better storyline and characters, and whilst the other 2 games have proven to also be fantastic in their own right, this original was something fresh for the time. So if you haven't played BL2 or Pre-Sequel yet, i highly recommend playing this, i recommend it most if you have friends to play it with."
4650,"Aight lets duo this through we got this m8 we got this, me soldier, you hunter? ok this should be a great time.

I'd ask him to shoot himself, but then he'd probably miss regardless....
8.8/10 play this with your friend"
4651,"Me and a friend coudn't decide on a game we wanted to play together and eventually he got a free copy through humble bundle (I already had it) and we decided to try this.

This is now the only game we play together."
4652,Amazing coop and great loots for the rng loot lovers like me!
4653,This is one of the games that I return to all the time.  Played this on xbox for a few years  before Steam.
4654,"This game is seriously so great. I do prefer Borderlands 2 more, but I've played this so much recently, and it was so much fun. Its a good game leading up to an even better game. I highly recommend this for people liking simple FPS and RPGs. aaaaaaaa"
4655,"Good multiplayer game, enjoyable-replayable story. Playing it again in 2017 with friends and having fun."
4656,"Weapons and havoc in a Mad Max-like scenario,what do you need more?"
4657,"Perfect just Perfect. Got killed. respawn. Got killed. respawn. Find box. Wow nice gun, full-auto. Death by snowball huckin Poler bears. Repeat."
4658,A good game to spend hours on it and still get the feeling that you ain't done everything
4659,"[b]One of the most amusing and action packed co-ops I've ever played.
[h1]Grab a friend or two or your significant other and dive into hours of entertainment ![/h1]"
4660,Diablo in fps format.

4676,One of my favorite games ever!!!!!
4677,"THIS GAME IS EPIC!!!! THIS SERIES IS EPIC

Favourite series of all time. Epic storyline, epic NPCs, epic protagonists, EPIC!!!!!"
4678,generally better than it could be
4679,"Want to be touched? Like not in the heart, but physically skullf***ed until you decide you enjoy it? Well try the entire Borderlands series, BL1>BL2 and the storylines are all great."
4680,"Good game, great port.  cheap....buy it.  

"
4681,Great game that still holds up today.

4684,GOOD
4685,"Nostalgia is nostalgic 
8/10"
4686,Fun and funny.
4687,Kick ass humor and fun game! Lots of missions too!
4688,"Just as good as I remember it on PS3. Totally worth the play for first timers and a replay for the vets.

It's best played with or friend or three. Mix and match the specs and classes for best results.

Do all the missions for best immmersion, fun and loot.

Try to keep a weapon type of each and all elemental flavors so you can handle any situation.

Graphics, music, sound fx and commentary are all spot on. 

10/10."
4689,My intro to the series years ago! I replayed it a few times with people that had never played and they loved it. Definately recommend.
4690,I love Borderlands 2 and I also Love the Presequel this game is pretty good so far of what I played. Borderlands is one of my favorite game series
4691,Crazy Game. Its Borderlands all the good all the Bad all the insane XD
4692,Remains the best game in the franchise so far
4693,So far I loved it! Excellento0o0!
4694,"has to be one of the best fsp, rpg games atm 
"
4695,This game is what really got me into gaming.  The fighting is great (even though the hitboxes may be weird sometimes) and the co-op is extremely fun if when you are playing with friends.  This game is pretty much a first person shooter RPG game
4696,"Loved it on ps3 (system died), bought it for pc to play again."
4697,hey that's pretty good
4698,buy and play
4699,"I've had this game for such a long time now. Bought it years ago and played it with some friends and I gotta say. This has to be one of the best Co-op games I've played so far, and I've played quite a bunch. You can troll your friends really badly by standing in doorways when they try to get out, give them a complete pink car (which looks ridiculously stupid). Hell, I remember that when my 2 friends went in a car and just drove away, I went Berserk mode with Brick and beat up their car. Also a little spoiler here: [spoiler] Don't ever try to kill Skagzilla when all of you are 6 levels underlevelled. We did that and literally fought Skagzilla for 40 minutes straight, giving eachother our guns because we ran out of ammo but the other person still had ammo for that type of gun. [/spoiler]
TLDR: Get this game with friends, if you like FPS RPG then you'll love this game."
4700,its bad
4701,After all these years still great fun. Co-op is ofcourse the best experience but solo play is still very enjoyable.
4702,"I took a very long time to get around to playing this for a game and a series I heard so much about, and I regret not having played it sooner when there was a lot more active hype and community. Still, incredibly enjoyable game. There's some grindy and repetative bits, but I find while they get a little boring in solo play, I barely notice them when playing with a good friend. And honestly, if you've missed split-screen and couch co-op, Borderlands is worth the buy just for being one of very few decent, modern-ish games out there that allows it."
4703,Still a lot of fun *-*!!!!
4704,"Fun at the begging, so boring and tedious at the end when the game literally forces you to do most of the fetch side quests in order to do the main missions otherwise you will have to die tens of times just to kill regular enemies that are only 2-3 levels above you (yes the game reduces much of the damage you do to enemies above your level so you must level doing side quests).

Also the story almost doesn't exist and the characters are very weak so there is nothing to push you to play the game further especially if you came from Borderlands 2 which is a far better game.

So to sum up; just go and buy Borderlands 2 and skip this one."
4705,"What are you waiting for?!

Go grab it and play it, otherwise you will not learn how to be a badass!!!

GOTY."
4706,Just buy it!!
4707,i want to complain but i also couldn't stop playing it until i finished so...
4708,Got this game for free from a friend and never bother to play it until recently. Ohh man this game rocks! Basically it is a great game if u want to burn some times during your free period and it is even awesome game for co-op. Too bad my friends all moving up to Borderlands 2. Recommended to buy this game and Borderlands 2 :D

4712,"Absolutly marvelous , comming back to it again and again , best played with friends though , the more the better.
Shooter with good story , and usable loot, and really no rush, and you can come back and ""farm"" npc's for more loot :-)"
4713,Fun ride.....better that Borderlands 2.....
4714,Still a great game after all these years.

4719,"I couldn't tell you exactly what it is, but I just keep coming back to Borderlands when I am in the mood to play a FPS game. For some reason, it never seems to get old for me. And to be honest, Lilith is my favorite player character in all 3 of the Borderlands games. Her version in the sequel (Maya) really couldn't hold a torch to her... and no one else other than Claptrap was as flashy to play once all of her elementals got going. Overall, the characters in the game (both player and NPC) are well-crafted and memorable... and keep me coming back on both console AND PC. And then there's the loot..."
4720,8 years later and Pandora is still one of the most interesting places... Just buy it.
4721,16 million guns go buy
4722,Strip the Flesh! Salt the Wound! Masterpiece that shows human nature in it's worst development through magnificent landscapes of Pandora.
4723,"Borderlands is a good game that offers lots of weapons to mess around with, a good story, and many different types of enemies to annihilate. 

The game is lacking quite a few quality of life features but is a great base to be built upon.

4730,I really love this game <3
4731,"The Borderlands series has a lot going for it to be sure. While the second may be bigger in scope, this one is certainly my favorite"
4732,"Remains to this day one of my all time favorite games. Original, gnarly, subtle, in your face, absolutely everything I didn't know I wanted, no, needed in a game. I will always come back to it and with how often this is on sale, I see no reason you shouldn't play it as well."
4733,"Even after years of being out, this games graphics and story are a pleasure to play multiple times and doesn't get old or boring."
4734,"I never really got into the Borderland series, but with the entire series on sale for $25, I figured ""why not?""  I'm 3 hours in and glad I made the purchase.  The graphics are outdated, but the gameplay is fun."
4735,One of the best games that i have player ever. :D
4736,Borderlands is interesting take on FPS game. Its loot is a bit misleading. A gajillion guns but what makes it so many is the slightly different stats on the same gun. I like this game because it is a fun relaxing experience that is easy to play. It has its moments
4737,"Hella fun, played the crap out of it on cosole!"
4738,Just awesome
4739,"CATCH A RIIIIIIIDE! I- uh hi. Yeah, Borderlands.. 100% on my list of favorite games of all time. Not a question."
4740,Play this if you like killing stuff.
4741,"Decent game, jump scare me a lot, helped me clean my veigns from the increase of heartbeats."
4742,Great fun. Love the multiplayer.
4743,"I originally thought that I would not like a game that looked so like all the other RPG games. 
I was wrong.
I love how many weapons there are. How there are very rare weapons. [spoiler]You can beat the game and replay at what experiance level you left out at.[/spoiler] Which makes the game harder yet even more fun!
I may be very late with buying this game and playing it but I was not strayed far from really great fun!"
4744,It's a lot of fun with friends.
4745,Top FPS adventure game. Good storyline. More than enough side quests and loot. Solid expansions and replayability.  Only negative for me was occaionally trouble finding a quest item and had  to google it. Didnt come across any bugs
4746,"Borderlands, even tho its older, is a great time. By yourself or co op with a friend. The bosses are funny and brutal. The gameplay and storyline is a delight. If you have never tried any of the borderlands before, try this one first, its well worth it."
4747,nice rpgfpsrtstdmobammo !!
4748,"Borderlands is a great game. It has it's own personality. The landscape it takes place in, the music and so on, makes the athmosphere a bit melancholic, which is great for having a persona, but not a cup of tea for a lot of people.
Overall the game is great."
4749,"still fun, even many years later."
4750,"one of the few good RPGs with coop mode

good comicity


[spoiler]...and there is a zombie with a weapon chest on the shoulders who throws lightning balls at you in a DLC ,lmao[/spoiler]"
4751,Oke
4752,"Is this game worth your while, will it make you cry of laughter and enjoy every minute of it? 

Yes."
4753,"Infinitely replayable. Have had it for about 6 years, beaten the game multiple times on multiple playthroughs and is still fun to come back and play again, especially with friends."
4754,i love it this one and all the others
4755,"This game is a lot of fun. I'm not too big on FPS shooters usually, but I have to admit, I loved Portal 2, I loved Fallout New Vegas, and this game feels like a very worthwhile beldn of the two. I got this game as part of a Humble Bundle ages ago, but if I'd known how much I was going to enjoy it, I would have gladly bought it outright. Great game, lots of fun, some nice challenging DLC and lots of dark humour."
4756,"I've been playing this game for so long since I bought it in the ps3. It is such a pleasure to see that this game is still one of the most exciting yet fun games for me to play with, and without my friends. If this game never existed, then I don't know if I will be able to be alive today. Borderlands saved my life. I believe, it will save yours. Please, don't kill yourself. You are worth a thousand butterflies. Stay alive. Stay alive for me."
4757,Fun in co-op.
4758,its a game.
4759,"Played this game before borderlands 2, can still play after playing Borderlands 2. Sniper Class using Sniper rifles and nothing else was harder than expected but doable, 10/10"
4760,"First game in one of my favourite series. clock this, then get bl2 and clock that."
4761,"This is one of my favorite games of all time.  Even after leaving it for years and then coming back to it, it feels as fresh as it did the first time I played it.  Can't wait for Borderlands 3!"
4762,"A friend gave me the GOTY version of this game with all of the DLC. Extremely fun. Entering I didn't even think that my potato powered laptop will even load this game but to my surprise it did and surprisingly well! A phenomenally optimised and fleshed out game, addictive too. I give this a solid 9/10"
4763,"After all the years of this game being out, still one of the greatest classics out there. 10/10"
4764,"Unique climate of gameplay, looks the most crude and borderladish in relation to other borderlands games. Definietly can reccomend"
4765,I got this old Diablo II - Feeling....
4766,It's good.
4767,Borderlands2 is a lot better but its still fun with friends
4768,"Bi daha dünyaya gelsem, bi daha Borderlands oynardım; ama başka arkadaşlarla :))))"
4769,"Best game. 10/10. Graphics may be from 2009, but the art is so good you don't even mind. Story is amazing, with the perfect balance of humor, action and adventure."
4770,buy it
4771,"It may play slower than the newer Borderlands, but it still plays great and now comes with a taste of nostalgia. Patiently waiting for Gearbox to make a Borderlands 3."
4772,"Great game for playing coop with friends. Wouldn't go as far as saying that it is the ""Diablo II"" of shooters for me, but it is definitely worth the time and money to pick up this game. Did not really enjoy playing solo though.

The characters encountered and the world is bizarre and will make you laugh and possibly miss your shots sometimes.

Can be played just for fun and also for hardcore grinding to get your OP vault hunters..."
4773,"the year is 2017, and i am still spending tens of hours on this game. this is what quality is."
4774,I like weapon cases.
4775,"the best fps-rpg to ever come out, period"
4776,"Borderlands is a great RPG Shooter. The single player keeps you engaged with the random antics of all the characters while the main story is pretty basic. Playing with friends makes the game even better. While the game is starting to show its age, it is hard to not come back and re-experience the staple to Borderlands that is an odd looking robot that you have a hard time to explain called Claptrap. i have played most of the Borderlands games and especially enjoy diving back into the lore of the series by replaying the first game after spending lots of time in the sequels to find new things. All in all the borderlands series are a great little getaway even for a little while here and there."
4777,ssssssssssssooooooooooooo much LLLLLOOOOOTTT
4778,"It's a nice game, loot drops are way under level 99% of the time, but it's a nice game"
4779,"Borderlands is effectively a single player MMORPG. It has every aspect of an MMORPG; it has a skill tree, level system, item rarity, static NPCs, respawning mobs... And for me, it is the perfect remedy for my lonely WoW days, when all my friends have leveled way before me and I was forced to grind solo to catch up. Here, you are *supposed to* go at it alone.

The humor that everyone loves in Borderlands 2 starts with the DLC's of Borderlands 1. Especially Secret Armory of General Knoxx cracked me up.

Try it. You won't be disappointed."
4780,"Great cooperative and solo experience, just a little bit ""slow"" then the 2nd one, but really worth it

9/10"
4781,WUB WUB!
4782,"Every year I go back and slog through the newer Borderlands games (namely you, Pre-Sequel), and every year I come crawling back to my first love: the original Borderlands.  It's fun, funny, and not too over-the-top."
4783,An old game now but still one of the best.  Hopefully Borderlands 3 returns to the same game-play but more so.
4784,just awesome
4785,fun ;D
4786,"Played this game out of respect to having really enjoyed playing Borderlands 2 and the Pre Sequel. This was more of an attempt to see what happened to in the rest of the storyline. I was so impressed. BL1 is no slouch and it is clear why this game was worth so much further development in DLC and future releases.

My only criticism is that in some of the DLC for BL1 you need to cross many maps to reach destinations and this becomes a bit ownerous when you are in a coop group."
4787,"A very fun game with a fun loot grind to be had. Learn what element is used against what health bar and go nuts.

Let's be honest though, fun though this game is, this review is written for the badge."
4788,good
4789,"This game is purely awesome , i played it a couple of years ago .. but just now i decided to actually buy it and explore all the features it has. I don't regret it ! 10/10 ."
4790,"I never had the chance to play this game when it came out. Now I did... and I loved every single minute of it.
I've completed every mission and explored almost every corner of the map while going through the story mode. It is worth mentioning that co-op mode is so much fun too.

One of the most entertaining FPS games out there, without a doubt."
4791,"""Hey, check me out everybody! I'm dancin', I'm dancin'!"""
4792,"Great game, love it"
4793,Fun gameplay and lots of humor. Randomly generated objects are unique and keep the game interesting. Missions get a bit repetitive near the end of the game. It's held up well over the years and I'd still recommend it if you want a taste of the Borderlands franchise.
4794,Found game to be infact PTW (Punch to Win)
4795,Loved this game so much I own it on every platform it was available on.
4796,This is an amazing game. Time sync and good! +gore!
4797,"To follow one's passion is simple, but to find one's passion is hard. As it would so happen, my passion appears to be shooting psycho midgets in the face. Thank you borderlands, for helping me find this. 11/10"
4798,very good
4799,Game of the [strike] year [/strike] century
4800,"Woah dude, play this game."
4801,Best shoot and loot ever. 10/10
4802,I fricken love this game. I will say anyone new to the frachise must play this game first. Not only is it because it the first game but because Borderlands 2 they kick it up a notch. Great game to play with friends.
4803,Too many pink panties. Not enough bobble heads and pizza.
4804,"Back when Borderlands didn't have Anthony Burch writing it and that reason alone makes it a automatic yes in my book.

Though it is good rpg-lite/fps fun with tons of content, so pick up for that reason also."
4805,Great game. Great franchise.
4806,best
4807,Good Story
4808,"its wacky....its wild...

Its Borderlands"
4809,"I went back to where it all began and I've been having a blast! Borderlands is still a great game, after all these years. Sure, it's not as polished as the sequels and it's creaking a bit but it's still brilliant fun to play. I played it first on the ps3 and as my laptop isn't a great machine to use for games, Borderlands plays extremely well on it which surprised me. It may even run better that it did all those years ago, which says a lot for the system requirements. If you don't have much under the hood of your laptop or pc, it's worth firing up borderlands again and checking out Pandora in the first iteration of the game."
4810,so cool....
4811,It's nice :D
4812,Its pretty fun
4813,played this in 2k17 and still had a lot of fun.
4814,An FPS/RPG that doesn't take itself too serious but manages to hit all the right boxes. Gotta love claptrap!
4815,Great Game. Get it.... Get it NOW!
4816,"So much fun to play with friends, really enjoy the size of the world and the amount of main and side quests. 
This game is a must have!"
4817,maldita sea que esta super recomendada esta mierda
4818,Just Perfect.
4819,"So many weapons to choose from.  8)

Borderlands is an awesome first-person RPG that appears to be set on a near-future, post-apocalyptic Earth but is actually set on a used-up planet (Pandora) elsewhere in the galaxy.  For the futuristic setting I would have expected better tech but it does make for a great atmosphere and great gameplay.

You can choose between four characters; I chose Mordecai the sniper/hunter.  Apparently you can play this game as a co-op team with three other players but I played solo.  You can also play two separate playthroughs, i.e. playing it all twice with everything scaled up the second time; the only benefit I see is increasing your level and skills and getting better gear for multi-player duels and such.  Although Crawmerax will definitely kill you on the first play-through.  Yeah, I only played through once.

The RPG elements of the game include weapon proficiencies (increased with actual usage, not skill points), skill trees (sort of, and you do spend points here), and, of course, quests - I mean missions.  There are no dialog options other than accepting missions or claiming rewards but there are a few characters that deliver their half of a dialog (or just a monologue) and most of the bad guys spout recurring phrases at you.  I have no complaints about the lack of real interaction.

Also note that there are experience bonuses for completing various ""challenges"".  These include hangtime when jumping off ramps in a vehicle, killing specified numbers of enemies with each weapon type, etc.  I didn't realize that until halfway through the game.

The rest is a fun shoot-em up with plenty of loot.  The weapons have different ratings and effects and sometimes intangibles. 
 Some you know will be relative garbage, but some you should try out to see how they behave - I've tried weapons with poorer specs than my current gear that ultimately worked better for me.

There were some things that really irked me though. The first was the lack of fast-transport locations in the DLCs; there are multiple regions in most of them, why can't there be multiple fast-transport locations for each of those regions instead of just one per DLC?  The second was tiny ""barriers"" preventing movement, eg. when you're on a platform and the ramp down to the ground sticks up 1"" above the platform you can't just walk on to the ramp.  Why the f*ck do I have to jump to clear a 1"" barrier when I can climb 6"" stairs?!

A third quirk was the behaviour of my Bloodwing.  Sometimes he mowed through a group of enemies just like he should, although that was usually in open spaces.  Other times he'd hit a guy or two and then disappear behind a wall and maybe show up again after I'd killed three or four other guys.  Or if I throw him directly at a flock of incoming rakk he'll f*ck off and MAYBE take them out AFTER they've all hit me.

So there were some frustrations (notice they're fairly petty) mixed in with the rest but overall Borderlands is a great game.

9/10"
4820,Even after almost ten years this game still holds up and is a classic in my libary
4821,Is good game.
4822,"Still, after all these years, eats up more of my gaming time than I like to admit."
4823,Very funny and top in coop
4824,GG Game !
4825,FUN!!! FUN!!! FUN!!!!
4826,pretty fun.
4827,Started a very good game serious
4828,Good Game
4829,"I don't know anything about playing this with other people, but i do know that playing solo is a blast.
It's an FPS, there are tons of missions, you kill lots of things - sometimes very big things, you farm loot like you do in hack and slash games where you farm loot, there are 4 playable characters, each one has their own skill tree and special ability, maps are large so sometimes you drive a car, you can't map the car to the AD keys, Mordecai has a pet bird - and it's awesome.
The game can be repetitive and frustrating, especially some enemies you have to fight over and over, but never to the point that I felt I wanted to stop playing."
4830,nice ge
4831,Incredible.
4832,"Good game...

Better than Borderlands 2 and the Pre:Sequel."
4833,⠀
4834,game good
4835,"Okay shamelessly, i love this game, it has its faults but i love it. I have somany happy memories palying this game so worth the money, incredible playing solo or multiplayer."
4836,The best game of the franchise and one of the better 1st person shooters.  Entertaining plot and co-op compaign.
4837,"It's just an amazing game. There's not much to say.
Sure, it has some flaws, but considering the price tag, you get a great value out of this.
A Diablo-like loot-based FPS with levelling a large amount of content, great humor and generally very unique characters.
Borderlands is one of my all-time favorite series."
4838,"To start i completely by passed this game when i saw it in the store, but eventually bought it on sale, and WOW! I have had so much fun playing this game and only really just began. The gameplay is so much fun, and gets pretty crazy at times. The guns are just insane, but again so much fun to find new ones. I would definitely recommend this game. Like i mentioned before that i have just started the game, i really cant wait to just carry on with it. Big thumbs up for this one."
4839,"The idle chat, the guns, and ClapTrap— nuff said."
4840,"Borderlands(GOTY) PROS- Many weapons(smgs,combat rifles,rokcet launchers,pistols),4 unique characters with 3 different skill trees. You can play this game with friends(Cooperative) and it makes game much easier than playing alone.Interesting characters like T.K Baha,Dr Zed,Scooter(Caaaaaaaaatch a ride dude :D).Decent story(I enjoyed more 1st bioshock story than borderlands ,but i cant say this game is bad).Cell-shaded graphics,very good gameplay and i talking about rpg+fps setting,boss fights,three cars models, and enjoyable dlcs,many different enemies.Really high level(69 max).

Cons-only sand and rocky biomes.Fast travel only unlocks when you complete half game,soundtrack kinda meh.85% all the game you only doing the same quests/missions kill that,pick up that,give me that,and over,and over again."
4841,"Borderlands is a game that grabs your attention from the start. There's a brief ""training"" intro, which also manages to include gunplay so well done on the tricky job of making the intro level not boring.

You'd start the game thinking it is just another first person shooter to blast your way through, but there are other elements to the game as well (pun intended). Yes, the RPG element of loot giving you different qualities of guns, and guns with different properties - a shotgun that fires rockets, a sub-machine gun that sprays acid, a revolver that sets things on fire - are randomly generated from properties of thousands of different component parts that add together to give the gun its final properties.

The gameplay is fluid, and the story is compelling, although for the vanilla story a few people were quite disappointed in the ending. The DLC is great, though, and are almost full games by themselves.

Multiplayer is where this game falters, since it relied on the Gamespy network in the past to list active games. Unfortunately this was the situation for a very long time, and only after there was no MP community left did they move away from Gamespy to something else, but it doesn't matter since everyone has moved on since then.

The in-game menu gives away the fact that this game was developed for consoles and ported to PC later, however they're still easily navigable

The music is amazing, dramatically enriching the atmosphere and making it very easy to lose yourself in this post apocalyptic dystopian wasteland.

All in all, the game had one or two deep flaws due to design choice, but they don't really make a big dent in the case for how good the game is, and how much fun it is to play."
4842,"great game to play with friends, one of the best co-op!"
4843,"This game is one to play with friends after a long day, or when you're angry at each other, or you just want to relax and shoot things. The writing in this game is by far the funniest dialogue I've ever heard, and it keeps me coming back."
4844,Good
4845,one of my favorites that i return to whenever im in a whole
4846,good
4847,"Nice combination of FPS and RPG elements with a bit sci-fi theme. The best part is when you have enough of solo play, you'll call friends and do co-op."
4848,"A great game with endless hours of fun, shooting random shit and free lootboxes."
4849,"It is a borderland game, isn't that enough."
4850,"I have a love-hate relationship with this game. Infuriating sniping (with anything from revolvers to sniper rifles), constantly horrible weapon drops (with ocasional exceptions), bullet sponge enemies, FLINCHING TO THE POWER OF 1000000 and on the other hand - satisfying headshots, happy grinding and good humour. Even though it looks like negatives outweigh positives, I stuck to the game till the end (something I do very rarely) and started playing all DLC straightaway. I even played it over Borderlands 2. I really don't know why, but I definitely recommend it. Just don't use sniper rifles unless you are fine with horrible FLINCHING. And yes, it is FLINCHING, not flinching."
4851,Brilliant game i can't wait to play the 2nd Borderlands
4852,I played this before it came out on Steam and I decided to buy it again when it was on sale and play from the beginning just to get steam achievements for the game. It's that good!
4853,"The game is really worth replaying to get the achivements, all the DLC are interesting to play."
4854,"Ever wanted to just chill out with your buds? This is the game for you.

Here's a list what you can expect:
[list]
[*] RPG play-style. Now mix that with FPS.
[*] A fair bit of quests.
[*] Levels do matter. Yes. Even that 3 level difference matters, when you are playing co-op. You'll get your ass handed to you.
[*] Grenade jumping, obviously.
[*] Cartoon-ish style (you obviously already know that).
[*] *whispers* People save-editing.
[*] Just general fun.
[/list]

[h1][u] Conclusion! [/u] [/h1]

Worth it? *shrugs* If you got nothing to play, give it a try. Just get it when it's on discount."
4855,"A great Loot-Shooter with the ability to pick up any wepon and blow a migets head off.

8/10 Plot takes a dive after the main story and the Knoxx DLC and gets a bit less intersting after beating the game once and starting a new game."
4856,!
4857,"Fun game, whether solo or co-op."
4858,It's good.
4859,Pure Genius
4860,"so much fun!!

play it with friend is makin it so great!"
4861,Yes
4862,Not as good as Borderlands 2 but still very climatic and fun to play.
4863,"Borderladnds is a realy good game to play with friends, with unique graphic and realy nice rpg elements."
4864,It's time to loot guns and shoot midgets.
4865,"Started with Borderland2 and after tons of hours of fun figured I would try the original.  Wow, this is amazing for the age of the game.  Sooo much fun and so much treasure to be had.  Just loved it and it consumed my time in the best way possible."
4866,"One of the best games out there, Really enjoyed this game"
4867,"godd
"
4868,"Had no idea this was going to be this much fun....if you play with your friends, if not it can get you tired a bit faster than ideal...Anyways some fun characters, good action/adventure gameplay!! Can't wait to play the next titles of the series :)"
4869,Still holds up to be a fantastic RPG
4870,love the series cant play it enough

4874,"its good, really good"
4875,Is good
4876,"Really fun time. The guns are great, and the gameplay is mindless fun."
4877,"Borderlands is a FPS-RPG game ported from console, made by Gearbox Software and published by 2K games.
Is a game about finding a hidden Vault full of tehnological wonders on a desert-like planet, this only being a rumor spread by the locals.

You are one of the 4 mercenaries who want to find this so called Vault with the only purpose of being rich.
One of the facts that deeply disturbs me is the gender inequality that is found in this game.
1 out of 4 mercenaries is actually a girl (Sirene, which is actually quite a lovely name).
So, there shouldn`t be as many girl characters available to play as men are?

Some other, thing that makes this game boring as fùck, is the lack of any in-depth customization of the characters.
I mean, Mass Effect 1 had such in-depth customization and it was a game who was published 2 years EARLIER than this game. I suppose that the guys from Gearbox aren`t games, just developers.
The only customization in game is about changing the colour of your T-Shirt, pants and hair and that`s about it.

Another aspect that is worth looking at, is the simple fact that side-missions are MANDATORY and not optional.
What does that even means? Well, in order to fight/kill mobs you MUST be their level since you cannot simply survive to a group of mobs that are JUST 1 LEVEL ABOVE YOU. You simply can`t and I just don`t understand why. So in order to complete the main story and to have enough level to complete it, you MUST do side-quests.
Also, side-quest are as boring as the ones you can find in most MMO-RPGs on the market.
Boring, unmemorable and unsadisfactory.
There is no other way around that.

There`s also other aspects that makes this game even worse and I`ll try to be as quick as possible since this review is already way too long:
~ mobs that spawns every time in the same place, after you killed them and every time you are trying to do a side-quest they are there;
~ combat (shooting) feels slow, unsadisfactory and unbalanced; for some reason the sniper weapons are extremely un-acurate, same thing with machine-guns and shotguns, the only guns are are decently accurate are the pistols and rifles;
~ player have acess right from the start to very-high level areas and quests; there`s no visible delimitation between the areas where he/she shouldn`t go and the starting areas;
~ items that are in store are expensive and most of the times not even worth buying, 
save for some limited items;
~ weapons that drop as loot are in 99,99% of the time, uninteresting and crappy af;
~ Claptrap, nuff said.

[h1]Conclusion?[/h1]
Borderlands 1 is a game not worth picking. It lacks the depth of characters, unbalanced in-game economy and combat, mobs spawn in same areas absurditly fast, MANDATORY SIDE-QUESTS, crappy loot-system and loot-items, every robot in this game is called Claptrap and for some stupid reason, developers decided that is really funny and it should be there to annoy us with his stupid voice lines and so called ""dance"" moves.
I am waiting for a re-make."
4878,"MasterPiece 10/10
+All content
+RPG/FPS in one game"
4879,"I really like this game for its graphic and its open world mode, there is so many thing you can do and want to do in this game, just the matter of time before you wake up after 3 days without sleeping and eating :3"
4880,"Fantastic for both casual and core gamers. The controls are easy to learn and it's a great way for someone new to FPS (first person shooter) to get into the genre and have a lot of fun doing it. It's not too difficult to feel like you're really good at it, and to start feeling that rush of doing well in a game. Because of the co-op options, it's great if you have a friend or a significant other who wants to get into gaming, but needs a little help or a game that isn't so complex (in the lore and controls) to start with. You can each grab a controller, and play together, learning each others' play styles, finding loot for each other, and driving the cars together (one drives while the other guns). 

By the way, driving the cars is great, and if all else fails, you can run stuff over. And over. And over. Find you a car by looking for the sign post that yells out, ""This is where the cars live! Get you one!"" 

The dialogue is some of the funniest and strangest I've seen in games for a while. They really created some memorable characters, with semi-plausible quirks (such as a lady who has had no human contact for around two years and goes pretty bonkers in the time alone). 

While it also calls itself an RPG, and there are some RPG elements, this isn't a very ""deep"" RPG, where you get choices in how you shape your character and the responses you give in dialogue. The roleplaying aspects come in the form of your choice of 4 characters, the perk tree, and the ""class mods"" (which you can switch out at any time and change your character's specialization a bit). The ability to tweak shields and class mods, and choose from an endless array of weapons throughout the game means you've got plenty of time to experiment and find your play style. Me? I need a beefy shield and an SMG, and a Mercenary class mod for my Siren ;) 

Anyway, Borderlands really has stood the test of time - it is still entertaining (arguably some of the most fun I've ever had gaming, and that's saying something) and the art style holds up well even today - despite lower resolution textures it still looks intentional and not dated. 

Highly recommend picking it up.

(Note: I've played through lots on consoles, don't judge me by my Steam hours ;D )"
4881,So dull...
4882,"I know people will be mad and that's fine but I honestly didn't find this game fun but more annoying, with generic shooting mechanics and not so funny jokes. I always wonder why battleborn wasn't popular as it was basically the same thing as borderlands."
4883,Like every Borderlands game: BADASS AS FUCK
4884,gut for coop
4885,"A game that expanded on the shoot and loot genre. Very high quality game here that you can definitely pour thousands of hours into.

I give this game an 8/10."
4886,"I shoot some psychos and guns pop out of them
10/10 would shoot again"
4887,"I played this game well before I bought it on steam, but I bought it on steam so I could play with friends. All in all, I probably have somewhere around 200h on this game, and I still don't think I've ever totally 100% it. It's an awesome game, I highly reccomend it if you like trying to get the best equipment, looting, gory headshots, exploding, electrocuting and acidic ammunition in a grindy fps game. You can easily kill some time with this. Upon rebuying on steam, I played 16h my first 2 days (after a full day of work) because it's just that fun. Highly reccomended to anyone that likes FPS games and wants to hear the full story of the borderlands and vault hunters."
4888,"If you feel like spending a couple of hours (or weeks, depending) wandering around a beautifully rendered yet desolate landscape killing pretty much anything and everything with some seriously fun to shoot hardware, this here gem is the game for you."
4889,"First off: I got this game gifted, but after playing it for a while I can't believe I didn't get it long ago by myself.

It's a nice and fun shooter, but you can feel that it's a port (not that this disturbs at all).

"
4890,"I'm not the biggest fan of the genre, but let me start off by saying that this is one of the best first-person shooters I have ever played. I really enjoyed most of the 30 hours it took for me to beat the game's story. The graphics are really stylish and the basic gameplay feels very fluent and polished. The atmosphere is great and despite my somewhat low attention span, the game had me interested up to the final missions of the story (where it arguably slightly drops the ball).

I do have some negatives I should mention:
- The vehicle is very clunky to drive and even after getting used to the controls, it is impossible to fire in a direction without turning the vehicle. This would have been easy to fix by mapping the vehicle turning to the keyboard. Thankfully vehicle combat is only necessary in a couple of missions.
- Should be careful with leveling if you want any kind of a challenge. I made the error of playing through the Zombie Island DLC around the middle part of the game and that made me completely overpowered for the rest of the game and wasn't really challenged before facing the final boss. Try not to go too many levels above the enemies you're facing at a time.
- The game has a habit of spawning enemies behind you and enemies can always instantly pinpoint your location when you fire at them. Both annoyed me, but only minor flaws in an excellent combat model.

In the end these are just minor nitpicks and I definitely recommend the game. I did constantly find myself comparing (admittedly unfairly) my experience to another first person scifi-shooter, Mass Effect, which I enjoyed a good deal more because of the highly more memorable story."

Final Thoughts:
Got to say I so love these games. The soundtrack, the insanity, the Mayhem, THE INSULTS so awesome, I just love the writing in this series!
"
4892,"My very first ARPG game. Addicted.

2019 edit: The game is overpriced, you should buy it on sales. But the content is great actually, so buy the game on the normal high price if you want to support the devs!"
4893,"It's a fun game if you like to run around for hours looking for ammo and killing the same trash mobs each time you pass by.
Oh, and if you die, it just respawns you, for a fee. And you'll still have to go find more ammo, because you don't get it back when you respawn."
4894,"u should bother about borderland bc this game is a classic game and it's nice 'n' crazy, just wow dude"
4895,"Addictive, sadly there is many hacked weapons and shields that ruin the fun, but besided that everything is good. Delicious graphics, humorous characters, and replayability is ok, but not too good unless you make a new character (Especially when you reach lvl69). 8/10 from me."
4896, very fun game play.
4897,"Since I played the 2nd game first, I have to say that this game is not as good as that one. But then that is how it is supposed to be.  THis game was a fun ramage through Pandora running and gunning through the crazies.  It's definitely a lot shorter than the 2nd one, but I had a lot of fun playing both.

While it is fun, it does get a little same same towards the end. Same ole enemies to shoot, just a bit harder.

8/10"
4898,fallout rip off
4899,"Should be called ""Boredomlands""."
4900,"Two words.  Guns.  Loot.  Killing badguys.

Oops that was...umm...four words.  Oh well.

You have an endless supply of weapons to choose from, each one with it's own pros and cons, in general, and in different situations.  The loot system in Borderlands 1 is better than the other Borderlands games, allowing you to much more easily farm for legendaries either by killing bosses or just spamming the vending machines.  And yeah, killing bad guys...lots and lots of badguys.  

The story isn't as good as in Borderlands 2 but it's good enough to be enjoyable.  It can be a little monotonous at times when you have to kill dozens of enemies over and over again, but if you plan out and strategize the game and quests well, it flows very well and is quite fun.  

A great game that you can either play by yourself or even with freinds which is awesome!  Highly recommended."
4901,It's the best game I've played and ever will play I had it on Xbox 360 and had alot of time on it hope to play more on here
4902,"If the GOTY edition goes on sale, then there's no reason to not buy this game. This is the daddy of  FPS, shoot and loot games.

Borderlands has a fun solo experience and a phenominal co op experience. Crude, but great humor mixed with wacky characters and interesting dialouge. The game is a little older now, so finding online co op games with randoms may be a little more difficult. However, this game is best played with friends anyways, so grab 3 friends and start a playthrough."
4903,"Nope. Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel are masterfully executed, while this is not. Confusing guns, extremely repetitive fetch quests, infuriating UI, clunky tutorials, starts off extremely slow, the only environment is Desert Scrapheap (and, like, one snow level), sniper rifles are inaccurate (WHY?!), uninteresting skill trees, and the developers hadn't realised everyone hates Claptrap yet so there's like fifteen of them around the place. 
Low-budget, medium fun, highly experimental. Akin to Assassin's Creed 1: groundbreaking, but ultimately nothing more than a prototype. The only real reason to play this is to understand the plot going into the following games, but even that can be summed up in one paragraph. 

So, here it is, the entire story of Borderlands 1 in a single paragraph:


[spoiler]Four guys run around the desert looking for an alien vault with fancy stuff in it with help from a hologram lady. Atlas Corporation, who rule over Pandora, send in the Crimson Lance to stop them but they fail. When they get to the vault it was actually a monster prison to stop an alien murder thingy, which they promptly kill. Crimson Lance dudes die. Hologram lady was a satellite owned by Hyperion Corporation. Cliffhanger. Roll credits.[/spoiler]

Just buy all the other games and all their DLCs. This game isn't bad, but it isn't good either."
4904,"Borderlands is a really good game to pass a lot of hours with.
Even though it has a really good graphics for it's time, for me it felt a little bit antique. So I'm moving on to Borderlands 2. Hope to return to this one somewhere in the future,"
4905,classic
4906,"This is an enjoyable game. I love the artistic scenery of the world of Pandora. Also, what really stands out with this game is the number of weapons. While most shooting games might have 10-20 guns, this game has an uncountable number of them. That keeps things very interesting and makes this game unique. The perk trees for the characters are also really cool. And I like how this game lets you reassign perks/skills at any time rather than being stuck with you choose for the whole game which is what I'm used to. That was a well thought out feature to include. I recommend this game."
4907,LITERALLY BUY THIS GAME
4908,Just a godd game overall play it with friends and you'll have a great time
4909,This is the best game you can buy. Buying all the games and DLCs (even though it's expensive) is completely worth it.
4910,"This open world fps is mainly about shooting an looting. The maps and missions are a bit boring and the story is razor thin. I am also not a fan of the used cell shaded ('cartoonish') style. The combat however makes all up for that. If you have good weaponry, the shooting can be very enjoying. Its successors improved upon many of its weak points but unfortunately they also destroyed the combat system. In that sense I prefer Borderlands 1 over all the other ones which can be seen in the number of hours I have put in it.

8/10"
4911,FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! No More!
4912,9/10 would shotgun psycho in the face again!
4913,"What can I say about this game that hasn't been said? It's an amazing FPS, with some basic RPG elements mixed in that makes it one of the most fun experiences out there, even today, nearly a decade after it's launch.

Borderlands separates itself from the pack with its insane weaponry, crude (but often hilarious) sense of humor, cel-shaded art-style, and one-of-a-kind battles of badassery.

This isn't a new game, so there's a ton of in-depth reviews out there for you to read, so I'll just sum it up into pros and cons.

Pros:
Solid FPS experience with RPG elements rolled in
Insane, randomly generated weapons
4 character choices
Interesting art-style
Graphics hold up nicely even today
Good sense of humor
Lots of loot
Great replayability due to the uniqueness of every playthrough
Amazing Co-op and Single Player experience

Cons:
Based off of Unreal Engine 3, which has abysmal performance in this instance.
The game simply refuses to maintain a good framerate, no matter the settings/resolution for me.
The lack of some voicing can be annoying due to how the game handles scrolling through walls of text, however this was common in the late 2000's when the game released.
Not much story there, however what's there is pretty solid.

So there's my decade-late review. Overall, well worth it to pick up for anything less than $20. You'll need some friends to play with, because finding a match can be difficult, but with such a great game, you can post in the community page and come out with 8-9 people trying to find a match within a day."
4914,"I mean what more can I say.... It's Borderlands, if you haven't played this game you live under a rock and are totally missing out. BUY IT"
4915,"Not a bad game, this game started the RPG elements into FPS games. Not much story line but nice game play. Borderlands 2 is a better buy. You can skip this if you want. Not a bad time if you don't"
4916,"Borderlands' combination of fps action, a cartoonish art style, vehicular madness, satirical humour and the ability to play co-op with up to 4 friends keeps this game up there with the best, even after 8 years."
4917,"Here's what you get when you purchase Borderlands.

- Mediocre/Below average gameplay and gun-play that does not feel good and is does not compesate for...
- Repetitive gameplay and missions
- Hitboxes that are smaller than Kevin Spacey's remaining career in the tv and film industry
- Boring/Non-existant story (makes sense though due to the multiplayer aspect of the game
- False difficulty with enemies that are bullet sponges and can only be killed without exhausting your ammo supply by leveling up 2-3 levels higher than the enemy.

I don't recommend this game to people who are easily frustrated and don't like doing the same thing over and over. But I do recommend this game, only sligh- Actually no, I don't think I would ever recommend this game to anyone at this point. I would honestly recommend RAGE before Borderlands, and RAGE is the most jaded piece of garbage that I have ever spent time playing. If you want a good multiplayer game to have a laugh with friends, get Portal 2, a really well made and funny experience. Get Terraria, a game that you can start over hundreds of times and never get bored due to it's brilliant weapons and items, and it accepts multiple diverse play styles. Get Rainbow Six, get Left for Dead, get Fortnite get Rocket League, but don't aggrivate yourself with this game."
4918,Yes
4919,Great FPS + RPG combined. Perfect game to lan with a friend or two.
4920,"Great game with lots of replayability, as well as an innumerable amount of guns to play with. Each character class has their own playstyle, whether it's long range or up close, there is a character class for you."
4921,Dope.
4922,"[Rating: 8/10]
An excellent arcade-like FPS with a distinctive art style - great fun!

+ Excellent weapons and combat.
+ Distinctive art style.
+ Smooth and polished gameplay.
+ Great sense of progression.
+ Tons of loot and upgrades.

- Shallow story, not much depth to the characters.
- Enemies constantly respawn in completed areas.
- Enemy pathfinding and AI has some issues."
4923,"fps+rpg+coop+long campaign

enough said"
4924,this game suc monga dic with shitty friend
4925,Great game had alot of fun
4926,Borderlands is a Great game! Infact the whole series is worth playing. Sunk many hours on the PS3 into this game. When I saw it on STEAM I had to have it! If you've played any of the other games you have to check this one out. Best describe it as a Cheeky FPS. Grab a group of friends and check out the Borderlands.
4927,"I enjoyed it, but it's nothing special. I don't get the hype or popularity for this game. It is worth getting, because it is a fun game. However, get it on special if you can, when it's selling cheap."
4928,Verry good game.
4929,"Very Awesome Game.

Pros:
-Good Storyline, a little bit like World of Warcraft.
-Lots of different weapons and items.
-Good graphics.
-Amazing level/skill system.
-Includes SP & MP (Peer to Peer).
-Very cool cutscenes and game intro.


Cons:
-Becomes boring after sometime of doing lots of secondary missions.
-World Physics are a little bit older than the Engine they used."
4930,"I've been playing this game ever since last year on my ps3 and pc, and I love it.  The diversity of weapons, crude humour, badass themes, and decent story make it such a unique fps suited to everyone.  However, it did come with it's faults, such as, lack of enemy AI diversity (SKAGS), so many skags again, no environment diversity and bland or no bright colours.

This game is one of the most unique fps games I have ever played 
8/10"
4931,"Fun game, but feels very much like a console port in gameplay feel, FOV etc. Also the forced meme humour gets tiresome quickly."
4932,Best game ever :D
4933,I can't explain it but I love this game.
4934,"really fun. the driving mechanics are, in my opinon, easy to use and better than in a lot of other games."
4935,"Great game if you are starting with shooters, really inmersive and there are a lot of ways for killing enemies. It can get a bit boring go from one place to another."
4936,"I never followed this game and got it as a gift from a friend and never knew what I was expecting. The game was a blast to play and I'm working my way through the DLCs after finishing the base game. The gun-play is very well done and there are plenty of gun styles so you'll find some that are good for you. It reminded me a lot of Fallout: New Vegas, so if you liked that game I'm sure you'll enjoy this. Amazingly, for a game that came out in 2009, the graphics still hold up fine on High and never really took away from the game. While the game does lack an endgame, the replayability is there, be it New Game + or starting as a different character. Also, because weapon drops are pretty much random and the diverstity of skills and your character power, I'm sure you could get a second run out. I played this alone but I could see this game being a blast with friends. The only real problem I can remember having with the game is that the story isn't the strongest and the ending for the Vault itself makes no sense to me at all. Overall, a great game and if you can get a friend to play it with you, you gotta go for it. Pick it up on a sale for sure."
4937,probaley my favorite game on my steam library
4938,Great Game!!
4939,great game 9/10 would catch-a-ride again
4940,"I picked up Borderlands for the first time in Oct 2017 courtesy of a Humble Bundle.  My sole intention was to play the game to learn about the Borderlands universe enough so that I could enjoy the Borderlands TellTale game, which I owned, but hadn't started because I knew nothing about the mythos.  With that in mind, I've logged nearly 60 hours in a few weeks in a mix of solo campaign play and online coop play with friends that I haven't gamed with in years.  The ""story"" if you can call it one is total garbage, but the game is undeniably enjoyable.  

If you haven't played it and you have a friend or two willing to join you, it's worth a few bucks as it can certainly keep you entertained for a good deal longer than some newer games."
4941,"A fine piece of work
One of my Childhood games that I still play to this day.
HYPE FOR BORDERLANDS 3!
100/10 Overatingly Postitve Seal of Approval"
4942,"Really interesting storyline, in addition, that omfg funny robot, that robot, YEES THAT ROBOT THAT RUNS WITH YOU ALL DAY LONG AND YOU CAN'T ESCAPE!!!!!!!!!

this game runs relly smooth on my computer and I like how the developers made the graphics look both cool and not laggy!"
4943,"amazing with friends, nice dark humor
"
4944,"Great game to have fun and enjoy some coop time with friends.

The game has an awful story that will probably leave a bittersweet taste in the end."
4945,Great game to play! Totaly suggest everyone to get it
4946,"I cant get enough of this game. The more i play, the more addicted it can be. I addicted toward this game af. I recommended this game to others. 

[b] p/s [/b]: if u ever stuck in game, ask help from the community. There are a ton of people that can help u.

Have fun..."
4947,"Amazing game, worth buying, go there, buy it, i dare you,"
4948,good fun
4949,"[b][Achievement Review for Achievements Hunters][/b]

Awesome game for Hunters, but it is much more enjoyed in conjunction with other friends, easy to get the 100%, but long; it will take you approximately 100 hours, plus you must know that in order to complete it you must buy all the DLCs, otherwise you will not be able to finish it.

It has many achievements that will be unlocked by playing the main story, and many others that will ask you to do all the secondary missions, in addition you have achievements that you will need a friend to help you obtain them since you will need to fight a duel and win it without damage, but a friend could help you a couple of minutes and that's it.

Your most difficult achievements are those in the Coliseum, you will have to spend a lot of hours surviving waves, i recommend you do it with a friend since it is easier to survive in group, finally it has some farming achievements but it is not very long, and there are good guides to make it faster.

I recommend it for all hunters who want to complete a game together with another colleague and who are looking to laugh a lot, because it's pretty funny.

[b]Summary:
Difficulty: 3 / 5

4950,"A really good game as for a 2009 game, would really reccomend it if wanting to play it in co-op. Playing it solo was fun just not completing all of the side quest and the ending was just a dissapointment, but everything else was fun. Better do it co-op if you're going to complete everything. The dlc's were awesome expect for the Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot, I had a lot of fun playing them aswell.

btw: Try buing it on sale, for 20$ I don't think it's worth it tho...

:)"
4951,"Borderlands is an excellent game! endless quests and dudes to Kill. Good variety for enemies, and easily 100+ hours of content. Truly endless combination of weapons, But many of them are pretty crap so you just sell em or dump em. Multiple classes give the game a good replay option. Co-Op is the best part, beating the campaign with Friends is truly a big highlight, and the #1 reason to get this game."
4952,"Great Looter Shooter 
Good Story and Memorable characters.

If you have friends that are intrested play with them, more the merrier. Serious you get more enemies and better loot chances"
4953,I love this game!!!!
4954,"Great storyline, good playthrough"
4955,Absolutely love this game. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys playing RPGs and a decent story. Missions are not too difficult and the enemies are leveled with the character. If you haven't played it before you are missing out and should definitely give it a try. The game has already been out for years but I still enjoy going back and playing it from time to time.
4956,"Borderlands is a great game, especially for those who love to loot in video games.  It's incredibly rewarding to know that you eventually become almost immortal if you keep investing time and effort into the game. While I still like Borderlands 2 better, mostly because the gameplay was touched up and improved a lot, the first entry to the series is just as good and worthy of a playthrough if you haven't gotten to it yet.

Borderlands is always better with at least one buddy, but even as a solo experience, it's a good time shooting up enemies and doing side quests. The game isn't very frustrating either, which surprises even me because of how intense the action can get. If you're dying a lot, it's because you're tackling an objective that'll get easier once you level up some more, nothing more than that. The graphics have a sort of cel-shaded style to them, and while yes, this game is pretty old now, thanks to the graphical style, it manages not to look all that dated, which is impressive. I think everyone will play this game at least twice because playing as a different character adds a new element to the experience and allows you to play with different tactics. Brick is an up close and personal kind of character, but Mordecai is more of hands off kind of character that focuses more on sniping.

So less than 10 dollars for a game jam-packed with fun content and all DLC's is an absolute bargain."
4957,one word: epicness
4958,Humorous and entertaining RPG and FPS crossover. Liked the comic style graphics. Only downside would be the lack of fast travel in DLCs.
4959,The classic loot and shoot game. graphics are starting to get dated but core gameplay is still great
4960,"I've never been bored so much playing a game. Absolutelly zero story, classes don't matter as their special abilities do shitt, useless driving mechanics, techable skills doesn't give you anything at all. 2/10 for the 5 minutes of fun I had when trying to drive for the first time."
4961,"Save for a few questionable technical decisions (duck is toggle, game wipes it settings upon DST change, mouse smoothing enabled and can't be turned off), fun game. I actually recommend AGAINST it alone, again due to questionable decisions (the first hour or so is just such a drag, several enemy types are almost invincible from the front and need to be shot at from the back), but it's such a blast in coop! Grab a buddy or two, buy a couple of copies, get microphones and get shooting!"
4962,Borderlands is the type of game where you don't need to put much of your focus in it and can multitask with it. The story is meh and the ending is disappointing but the gunplay is so much fun and the quests are generally fun. The characters in this game are hilarious! A must own for PC. 9/10
4963,"I loved it on console. On pc, you might not get the chance to play with your buddies because the game, for some, won't connecct to the internet, and there is no sure way to solve this issue. I bought this game to play with my friends - waste of money. Don't buy this game until they figure this issue out."
4964,"A game worth the buy if you have the money and are looking for something to spend your time on and enjoy immensely.
I have almost exclusively played these games alone, primarily because that is how I started and finished playing Borderlands 2 for the first time. Also, because I did not have a friend to play them with when I initially got into the first Borderlands. This is my second purchase of the games, first playing them on Xbox 360, so that is a bit of a testament as to how enjoyable the games are, in my opinion.

Solo, the game is fun and rewarding, also with a sense of challenge that is not easy or handholding, as the game is very straightforward (Shoot and Loot, while completing quests and leveling up). ALSO, a big thing for me, you get to keep all the loot drops for yourself! (assuming you have the inventory space) 

As mentioned, a great game/series to lose yourself in if you want a game to just chill and enjoy, maybe have a podcast or a show/movie playing while you play the game solo, or want a ridiculous fun time with some buds."
4965,It's realy a addictive game. The graphics doesn't hold upto AAA titles. But when it comes to gameplay mechanics AAA title doesn't hold upto Borderlands. Enjoying the progression system that keeps on rewarding me.
4966,Simply great
4967,"A very addictive Shooter game! Weapon mods and looting are very deep in this game. Not to mention also grenades have mods. And there are classes to choose from, A siren, a soilder, a berserker, or a hunter! Also you can play with your friend in this game, And sometimes enemies can get very hard and tough even if its level is 1 higher than you. 

But sometimes, grinding can be very hard. But overall, it's very fun and intense at the same time.
Highly recommended for some hardcore players!!"
4968,"good graphics and guns
but i get bored after 10 hours
i did not like the story"
4969,"The original Borderlands game is a fun FPS-RPG loot based game that is meant to be played in co-op, although you can play it solo. Compared to it's sequel, it doesn't fall much behind, especially in the gameplay elements. However, i have some issues with this title: the lack of dialogue, repetitive missions, and personally, the lack of environment variety: the entire game is a wasteland, with only a few exceptions. The DLC's aren't much better either, but combined they're as big as the base game. The game was a bit disappointing for me, but at least the gameplay, while not great, is fun. If you really want to try this, buy it on sale. Otherwise, i would recommend you to play it's sequel, Borderlands 2. It's better in almost every way."
4970,Claptrap
4971,"This is the one that began the franchise, but till now still the very best of the series to me
10/10"
4972,amazing me and a friend played it together was still as good as i remember
4973,"A game that combines the least interesting bits of an MMORPG. Dull and repetitive quests, boring gameplay, at most average gunplay, 99.9% useless and uninteresting loot, unmemorable characters, barebones but nonetheless bad story, a shockingly poor ending. It has very little to offer apart from the somewhat interesting graphic style. I am flabbergasted that it is generally a well regarded game."
4974,"The game is a bit outdated today. 
While nice RPG, there's too much walking, looting is tedious, aiming indicator moves by 1cm at least (bad high res port?)..."
4975,good
4976,"This game is very fun, would def. reccomend!"
4977,Classic. Diablo as a first person shooter.
4978,Really fun
4979,"It's a solid game, with a lot of content. Kill things with guns to earn money. Use money to buy ammo to kill more things to gain more money. Simple as that. Oh, and the story is really good too (both main storyline as the DLC stories)

It does have some cons though:
- Not enough fast travel spots
- Some weird bugs (which do work in your favor sometimes)
- It doesn't have the same cartoony style as the next two entries in the BL series (which makes this one stand out)

It looks really different from the other BL games, but that doesn't make it worse than the other two. It has aged really well, since I only got into it around September 2017. It has replay value, both for checking out other playstyles, other characters, and just getting into PT2 & 3 with cooler loot, harder battles,...

I like it. It's worth the full price. Get it if you haven't gotten it yet."
4980,bahti tupnqta
4981,"Man, I started off having some difficulty with bosses, and it would take me a good hour of training and getting better weapons, and overall just preparing to take down these bosses. I would gear up, and then head out, and spend a ton of my time shooting at the minions, until I could finally defeat the main guy. 

Then I just hopped in my machine gun runner and ran him over multiple times

10/10 would vehicular manslaughter again"
4982,"Got this game on Xbox360 years ago and 100% completed it... Saw it on the Humble Bundle and thought I'd go at it all over again on PC instead. 
I'd definately recommend it, it's awesome :)"
4983,"Solid game.  Pretty fun (I liked the sequel quite a bit more).

BEST INTRO OF ALL TIME."
4984,"i like it
great gameplay nice rpg fps game"
4985,This game is a good PFS game
4986,"8 years later, still badass."
4987,"one of my favorite games!

PS: already played through the retail version multiple times"
4988,"Compared to the second one where I couldn't get my hands/mind/eyes off it.
Here I find my self constantly doing anything else than playing the game. Like.. wastching youtube videos or writing this reviw or talking to friends or browsing facebook While the game is open in the background as I get constantly bored of it."
4989,"How can I still be playing this game, 8 years after its release?
Well, it's Borderlands.
Buy it."
4990,"Unplayable, I've owned this game on xbox 360 and am severely dissapointed, Win 10 with a it-7700HQ and 1050m ti this game will get 60fps on the lowest settings if you stand still, though most of the time the experience sits about 18fps, over time the game fps will actually degrade, after an hour you can expect 5fps. Looking online, there appears to be a tonne of forums about fixes for this, be aware that none of them work and its a very broken port. My reccomendation is to pick it up on console, playing the xb360 version on xbone you get all the dlc free anyways :) truely an awesome game if you own an xbox or (I can only dream) an insane Titan X SLI setup that enables you to hit 60fps in this game, oh well"
4991,Love this game
4992,"Just awesome 

"
4993,game wont start after you pick character.
4994,"With Borderlands 2 being the much more popular game in the franchise and improving upon the first in almost every way you might be wondering if it's worth it playing the first or skipping to the sequel. Despite the sequel being better overall especially in terms of story there are some things the first does far better that makes it worth playing through and coming back to even today. 

[b] Story/Characters	[/b]
Borderlands is an open world first person shooter with RPG elements that is the first of what are now called ""looter shooters"". The plot is very simple and simply involves you looking for the fabled vault. Compared with Borderlands 2's story or even The Pre-Sequel's it isn't anything great. Luckily it's still a good time thanks to having some great memorable characters that guide you along the way. The writing and dialogue for this game also holds up far better than the sequels as it doesn't have any forced jokes or meme references that age very poorly. Unfortunately there are a fair amount of forgettable characters here like Helena Pierce that you sense had a lot of backstory but the writers unfortunately incoportated them into the story in a very poor way.

[b] Gameplay	[/b]
The gameplay of Borderlands is without a doubt the best of the entire series. The gunplay is phenomenal and the guns pack a serious punch and feel powerful in general. As much as I love the improvements of the sequel it's a shame that the guns feel so pathetic compared to this one and lack the punch that Gearbox nailed here. The vehicle controls aren't the best but overall they are fun to control and nice for getting around the more open areas. Unfortunately there's only the standard runner available early on until you get many more options in the Knoxx DLC.

[b] Visuals/World	[/b]
The cartoony visuals of Borderlands are incredibly unique and make Borderlands truly stand out. Even better is that since they didn't go for a realistic approach the visuals age very well and still look great. The world of Pandora looks amazing and has many great locations. Unfortunately one major issue is that there are only desert locations and it can get old after a while. This isn't like Borderlands 2 where you can go from a snow area to a desert area and then to grassland area. Overall though the locations are well made enough to not have this hold the game down too much.

[b] Loot	[/b]
Of course one of the biggest elements of Borderlands has always been the loot and the first game has done it best. In Borderlands 2 many of the standard guns you come across feel lackluster and it's very rare to come across a decent gun. In Borderlands 1 it's very easy to get great weapons without having to grind for legendaries or use golden keys. The loot feels fair and I always love opening up a chest to see what i'll get. I've only gotten legendaries a few times but I don't ever bother grinding for them because the regular weapons from loot chests are good enough. The weapons also seem to be viable for a few levels so if you have a really good level 20 SMG it will be perfectly fine at level 24 where as in the later games it seemes guns become pathetic after just one or two levels.

[b] Optimization	[/b]
Borderlands is an older game so most people should have no problem getting 60fps. If you have a monitor with over 60fps you can also uncap the framerate in the .ini files. It is a negative that this wasn't included in the game but at least it's there. Overall one of the biggest issues with the game is the options menu as it lacks a lot of options that should be there especially the FOV. The FOV is my biggest issue as I had to bind a key on my keyboard to change the FOV to something that wouldn't hurt my eyes. You can find that here and I highly recommend doing it as the default FOV is awful http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Borderlands_PC_Tweaks#Adjust_FOV_.28Field_of_View.29

[b] Final Verdict 8/10	[/b]
Despite its flaws Borderlands is still a game well worth your time. It offers a lot of variety in its four playable characters and is worthy of multiple playthroughs. I haven't even touched on the DLC's which for the most part are great and I definitely recommend picking up the Game of the Year Edition."
4995,If you dont have this game then shame on you.
4996,This game is awesome. The dlcs are great. I will say however the Underdome dlc is a bit diffcult in solo.
4997,Super funny game.
4998,"Graphics:	★★★★☆
Sound:★★★★★	
Gameplay:★★★★★	
Music:★★★☆☆"
4999,"   The original game that started the whole series, definitely a must have for everyone's Steam library."
5000,"UUUGGGHHHHHH no v-sync option, the screen tearing is too high. First person shooter with no fov uhhhh yuck.
For the life of me i cannot play this because of the dreadful graphics options, like i want to increase my fov and use v-sync, to be fair, id settle with just v-sync but no. Too many tears, literally cannot play."
5001,"+Pros: Fun coop, Great Gameplay 
-Cons: No anti aliasing and no FOV custom on settings"
5002,Excelent game! lot of fun!
5003,"Great when playing solo, even better with friends. Kinda like beer."
5004,Great Multiplayer Game! used to play this on the playstation 3 for atleast 200 hours with my friend. Got it off humble bundle and started playing it with my friend again and its still a very good game. Only problem is getting it to run now that the servers are down to play together but after a bit of tutorial videos and using hamachi its fine
5005,pretty gud
5006,"I love this game enough to continually rebuild my PC and repeatedly reinstall windows to play it. 
(some kind of launch bug that sneaks up and suddenly nukes the capability to launch BL or BL2)
If that doesn't tell you something about it, I dunno what else to say."
5007,"If you look in my screenshots you'll see one of the signs says
""Pis off""
Piss*
learn to spell faggots
2/10 for a hot girl tho"
5008,I like :)
5009,"The game sure is fun (Hard to write good about it now as Steam just blew away the review I was writing) I got recommended to buy the game from a friend who had just played Borderlands 2 on the ps4 but now he switched to pc and we both bought Borderlands 1 and dlc to play togheter.

I bought the Game of the year edition for 46,43 SEK around 5$ (I also got Borderlands 2 and some other shitty games on Humble Bundle) my friend bought it for 30€ for some dumb reason.

The graphics somehow still holds up to todays standards justs by being thsi cartoony style but compared to The Walking Dead this looks better even with the similiar style.
The co-op mode was just AWESOME, it was a pleasure to play with my friend.

Pros: 
- Co-op was a good touch so you could play with your friends with this RPG looking game
- Challenging to say the least but fun to get some challenge after playing easy games
- The game isn't short, 20 hours for all of the main game (Not including achivements, not dlc)
- Cartoony graphic style
- The Save System in this game should be standard for all other games to follow

Cons: 
- Map design... Just awful... Just please don't....
- UI.. It probably was made for console wasn't it?
- Good guns in-game are hard to come by (I had a lvl 4 gun till I was lvl 23)
- Sometimes unexplainable problems with the game

Overall it was a long and fun game to play with my friend since he switched to PC MASTER RACE! But we haven't finished the dlc yet so I guess I'll continue playing this awesome game. It was repetitive sometimes getting mission were you pretty much have to just find things and turn them in...

Overall score:
8 Swedish Empires out of 10 
Story score:
6 Swedish Empires out of 10
Graphics score:
9 Swedish Empires out of 10 (For being a 2009/2008 game)"
5010,"So I've got to say I'm a little bit disappointed with this game. I mean it's an amazing experience truly... until you release how short the game is. I've been playing this with my mate for just over 21h and we've finished every single quest in the vanilla game (110). It's an amazing game but it's to short to pay 30EU to be honest.

-Pros
Still servers that support playing without lag, and runs smoothly on windows 10.
Really good gameplay.
Love the graphics.
Love the shoot&loot genre.

-Cons
Super short.
Around 20 of the existing 110 quests were repetitive go-and-fetch quests.
Every location in the game looks identical except for the last 3.
My friend found a weapon at level 4 that he used until level 23, IN A SHOOT&LOOT GAME!!!!!!
Found 3 legendaries in our whole playthrough 1 of them was usable, the others were shit.

So this game is pretty good, but I was disappointed maybe it's because I played Borderlands 2 first, I don't know. I'd say only buy this if you plan to buy the second game and only buy this on a Steamsale. Check out my profile for my specs I'm running this at maxed settings with 1200p resolution @62fps although the framerate is capped at 62 in this game. I've only experienced 3 framedrops below 60 in 21h of gameplay give or take. 

Final verdict is a 7/10"
5011,"Such a good game... i have never played a borderlands before this and im loving it, looks like im going to be working my way up and finishing this and then getting no2 and no3. Highly Reccomend :D."

5013,"Don't be fooled by my hours, been playing this since the Xbox days back in 09. The PC version makes this game even better!"
5014,"Very bad port of a console game, which already has many design flaws. Irritating beyond belief, so glitchy that even setting up basic things won't work, like online co-op play or even menus.
Having played Borderlands 2 a few years ago, I didn't expect this huge gap in quality and design.

PROS:
-Visual design which stands out
-Clean graphics
-Humble bundle?

CONS:
-Terribly designed UI for pc
-Glitchy as hell, online won't work easily or not at all
-Completely unbalanced and boring, punches deal more damage than a bunch of point blank gunshots
-Aiming doesn't work very well, and it's a first person shooter... COME ON!
-Movement is terrible
-Hitboxes are even worse
-Claptrap
-Randomness on everything, which makes it even more boring

I seriously do not understand how people liked this game so much back then. I have checked the xbox 360 version and it plays WAY better than this crappy PC port (like, hitboxes and aiming work on there). I wouldn't keep playing even if it were free to play."
5015,one of those games that run fine on my potato machine 10/10
5016,Who dosent Love Borderlands especially for the price of it.
5017,Just an amazing game.
5018,"What ever you do, do not press r, unless of course you actually want to reload. Reloading apparently uses up any bullets currently in the weapon. So if you reload when it still has bullets, these bullets will be deleted from the game!

I just failed, because I had no bullets!

And what;s with having to shoot the enemy multiple times, at least 6 times or more. No wonder you run out of bullets!"
5019,Great shooter with RPG elements.
5020,"Boring and repetitive RPG. Bosses are basicaly normal enemies with more health and damage, quest luck originality, story is almost non-existent. All i know about story is that im hunting some super awesome allien vault (i bet there will be shitty loot in there, beacouse i didn't find a good loot for atleast 10 lvl."
5021,Good game! :D
5022,"Played and complete with 2 friends, great game and would 100% reccomend!"
5023,really cool game with plenty of story and side quests. amazing looting system which keeps the reward to exploring and killing enemies viable forever!
5024,best game
5025,It's the best Borderlands.. What else to say
5026,Extremely boring and repetitive - do not believe the hype! All you do in this game is go from point A to point B taking up missions from random ass people. You do not get to really do anything on your own. Story is pretty much non existant - you only meet characters and find out about their backstory. I truely do not understand all of the hype around this game.
5027,"Pros:
+interesting graphical concept
+Fun the first 10 hours

Cons:
-Loot is stupid... Completely random. I was getting constantly useless items
sometimes 10 lvls below me. Also same lvl like me items had crappy stats.
-Becomes tedious after 10hours... Quests are repetive, you just kill and go back and deliver...
there are no shortcuts in ""dungeons"" to get back faster and many times you have to run all the place back
-Story is shitty...
-Bosses are too easy and sometimes just need to empty all your ammo in order to kill em... Like the final boss.
-First FPS I played where you shoot on the enemy and somehow shot missed..
"
5028,"Totally worth my 1$ , It's fun as hell. Beware that it's different to traditional FPS games, with more RPG elements
EDIT: Just finished the game, it's a solid 8/10, the middle few areas were just tedious and I feel like the fast travel could have been better, other than that, it's amazing"
5029,"100%'ed on the Xbox 360. Now thanks to humble bundle I have the entire borderlands collection. And I'm back to 100% again. 

Cons: 
-More tedius interface compared to newer entries in the series.
-Characters don't auto-pick up items
-Some graphics options need to be changed in the .ini file or using a config tool

Pros:
-Addictive gameplay
-Fitting music
-Excelent voice acting
-Humorous to hilarious comedy
-Loot - LOTS OF IT
-Many many many unique locations
-Story arc
-Uniuqe Characters each with their own special abilities, skill trees, and callouts
-DLC that is actually really good and expands on the story
-Pretty graphics that hold up even today

Overall an excelent FPS / RPG hybrid that manages to stand the test of time"
5030,"AMAZING game, I never expected that Borderlands is an RPG game, completed only first area of the map and it took me 8 hours, I can only imagine how much hours is still waiting for me, really lot of content to play, I have only performance issues and I dont know why, game is 8 years old and I have amd fx 6300, 8gb ram and gtx 950"
5031,"For a short review:
Excellent, addictive, interesting, funny and the guns... Seriously, so many guns ! And loot ! Very good game.

Official review:
The game by itself is absolutely a joy to play. ESPECIALLY with friends (better in fact). There's so many guns in the game that in the time I've spent in it, I've not seen a gun twice ! Although, today the game shows signs of age at moment.

Story:
There's not much to it actually, there's bits of lore here and there but otherwise, don't play for story. Even the humor for me didn't sell it.

Graphics:
Well, it's cell shaded so yeah... Don't particularly love it, the textures are meh... And everywhere, it's pretty much garbage, desolation and deserts... Character design is not bad and the guns are pretty interesting.

Gameplay:
By moments, it's insane how fun it is but damn does the game doesn't love you by others. For some reasons, it's just a little annoying to me but, if you keep your finger on any of the wasd keys when you're in your inventory, and still holding the button(s) after quitting it, your characters will not move. I hated that, I've had some bugs, even reload your last save kind of ones... With friends, the game is instantly better. So much so that it saves the game for me. The shooting is fun as hell but the guns fill kinda unoriginal in the way their bullet are shot. The driving is a pain in the butt, it's disgusting...

Soundtrack:
Well... Apart for SOME tracks, like VERY VERY few of them... It's a no there. The voice acting is good but still... Meh...

To summarize:
Buy this game if you have friends to play with for a long time. Completionists, stay as FAR AWAY from this game as possible. Some of the achievements are random... And the grind is not worth it. Solo players... Can be fun, but the game is good at making you feel alone."
5032,Very good game. If dlc played in right order realy fun.
5033,um
5034,Hated it playing it alone. Went trough it with my brother and that made it a lot more fun. Not really memorable and would not be able to tell you any cool moments. I remember having fun with it in coop so that is something I guess!
5035,"great game. if u have poor cpu like intel celeron n3350 this CAN run but with lowered options. so far im not that yet going deep through the story, and will play it regularly. It has nice gunplay as its sequel and if u never played this game, but played its sequel then dont worry. it still fun"
5036,"Pros.

Guns.
Guns.
Guns.
Guns
And guns.

Cons.

Not enough guns.

10/10"
5037,"nice fps game
you don't need to buy it
its free
just download generating tool
"
5038,"Get the GOTY, it worth every single cent. 
One of the best game ever really."
5039,Beep beep
5040,"This game is only worth playing if you DON'T have access to Borderlands 2..
But for those who don't have part~2 then
this game is absolutely worth playing and addictive..

~Addisctive like all games that generate random loot aka wepaon loot.
Games Like Dead Island w/ locked boxes you farm.
~Earth Defense Force w/ farming for wepaons etc etc.

i have a extra copy of the Game of the year addition if someone needs this game.
I would easilly part w/ it....

But part 2 improves every single aspect of the game. 
Except maybe story and the characters.
The Jedi Girl is better in Part~1
And the tank Brick is bette rthen the Gunzerking..
Actually the Gunzerker is awful..
His special is for 8 seconds he diel weilds any two weapons and has unlimited ammo..
He only benifits those who struggle w/ difficulty and not only is this game not difficult,
PC gamers can easilly handle it and would be bette roff w/ The Soldier or Lilith....

~Part 3 will be awesome but be prepared for LootBox microTransaction city....

ALso,,,The owner of this company= Gearbox is a absolute weirdO..
His interview where he pretends to not know the name of Jim Sterling 
(the youtuber who went to war w/ him) was distubring if not hillarious...."
5041,"Don't know if you play alone because i didn't play alone, but if you are playing with friends then this game is for you, didn't feel bored for one minute fighting for loot or sacrificing my friends to escape, Graphic is unique, shading is one of the best i have seen, that is for the pros ( might have forgotten a thing or two ) but if you usually play for friends then this is a 100% must buy

For the Cons:
Not much for Cons, but the outlines of objects can be a little frustrating, you might be shooting beside an object but it still hits the object instead
Second not much of a con but if you play alot of FPS you might feel weird at first using the guns.

Overall: A very good game that you won't regret buying

P.S: Bought this game from humble bundle for 1$ but would still buy it for full price if i had to."
5042,Play it while you listen to And So I Watch You From Afar and you will enjoy it at least 10x.
5043,"If you picked up every thing you could in Skyrim ""just in case"" this game is for you. So many guns to collect and fun to play."
5044,"For starters, I've been playing Borderlands on the console since it's intial release day. I've put countless hours into this franchise and just recently got the collection on Steam. Interested in Borderlands? Check out my review below.

THE STORY SO FAR... (SPOILER FREE)

The first game in the franchise, Borderlands gives the player control over 1 of 4 Vault Hunters. The story starts on a bus traveling through a hostile and unforgiving planet known as Pandora. You've come to this planet in search of an ancient alien treasure known as the ""Vault"". Most people on Pandora don't believe the Vault is a real thing, but some believe it holds wealth and power beyond imagination. Your goal here on Pandora is to find the Vault and unlock its power for yourself. Throughout your quest you will make allies, meet some of the nastiest creatures and bandits on Pandora and make a profit along the way. Its a massive world out there, prepare yourself.

PROS:

Weapons. Weapons in Borderlands are like no game before it. The game offers a vast selection in the form of generated weapons. Rarely you will find the same gun twice. The weapons have tiers ranging from White-Green-Blue-Purple-Orange (When Grandma Burps Patrick Obeys). They also come with different elements! Fire, Shock, Corrosive and Explosive. If you're lucky, you may even stumble upon the Alien class weapons.

Replay value. The replay value in any Borderlands game is INSANE. They ability to beat the main story and all and then do it all again against enemies that scale to your level is amazing. The loot is better, the missions are harder and the game is far more intense!  

Downloadable content: Borderlands is known for its amazing base game, but the addition of DLC is quiet nice as they unlock new areas for our Vault hunters to explore. Enjoy new stories, missions, people and weapons. Despite what some may say, the DLC in ANY Borderlands game is always well crafted and deserves a try, especially for a die hard fan of the franchise!

Gameplay. Borderlands gameplay allows you to be in control of your situation. Enemies are smart and for the most part will try to flank you, overwhelm you and even take cover. Does an enemy have alot of armor? Use a corrosive weapon to widdle him down. Maybe a bandit with an axe is coming right for you? Light him a blaze with a fire elemental weapon! Taking cover and playing smart in your environment is huge in Borderlands. Always assess the situation before engaging, it could mean life or death. 

Comedy. The game is full of things that will catch you off guard. You will laugh. Alot. No, really. Alot.

CO-OP. You and three other Vault hunters can take on the world of Pandora! Or if you prefer to play alone, dive on in!

CONS:

The pricing. Now, hold on there big guy. I know it's only $19.99 at my current writing of this. But adding DLC and so on can tend to get a bit high in price. I would recommend buying the series during a sale to save that extra cash or buy a bundle! I recently bought the Humble Bundle for $10.30! Which included the entire series. Borderlands 1 came with all DLC, while the other two games came with certain items, no real gameplay DLC. Either way, if you want a game you can play for awhile, this game works!

The start. Borderlands doesn't go crazy in-depth about your weapons. It'll tell you what elements work best for what enemies, what specific weapons do and so on. But they never really talk about ammo capacity, accuracy and fire rate. I've seen new players not enjoy the first few moments because their initial weapon was insanely inaccurate. Have no fear! It will get better. As you progress and gain new skills and perks, along with weapons, your aim will be true. Just remember to look at the specs of the weapon, otherwise you may be suprised. 

All in all, Borderlands is a fantastic game to own and the series is a blast. Looking for a comedic yet fun adventure, with a dash of gore and horror? Borderlands is for you!"
5045,The game is fun and definitely worths the price. even if you don't like FPS games you should give it a try.
5046,Crappy game does not work (anymore) on Windows 10 (Fall update).
5047,great
5048,"Bought this on Humble Bundle for £1 - played it 14 hours so far and enjoyed every second (minus a couple of rage fits due to me needing to git gud). Don't think I'm even half way through the game yet with all the included DLC.

Pros: Great gun play, nice RNG system for upgrading weapons/armour/mods, good exploration elements and pacing, challenging combat, and great optimization.

I play this at 4k on my 1080p monitor and it looks awesome - the cell shading really stands the test of time so long you play at high res - and it maintains 60fps easily. (i7 2600, rx480 8gb, 8gb ram, win 10). 

Cons: At this price it's tough to find any issues but there are some minor downsides; inventory management is a big part of this game and it can become frustrating when you have to ditch guns that might be great - so you need to be careful whilst being decisive - some might not like that element of the game. The other part I don't really like is the annoying robot saying 'check me out I'm dancin', I'm dancin' - wish I could blast it to smithereens. 

One other con is I had to change the .ini settings manually to enable vsync - otherwise you get nasty screen tearing - don't know why there isn't a vsync option in-game.

Conclusion: Without doubt one of the best value for money purchases I've made on Steam"
5049,Amazing
5050,"Same game, but pretty bad port. the menu is a pain, the settings are aa pain and it requires a little work under the hood of your somputer to get the audio working... beyond that, if you are into shooters where you kill midgest, psychos, monsters and eldergods, by all means, fun game."
5051,"WHY THE FUCK IS IT THE AUDIO IN THIS GAME WILL COME OUT MY PC AND NOT MY HEADPHONES EVERY FUCKING TIME I TRY TO PLAY AT 1 IN THE MORNING, GOD DAMN IT!!!!!"
5052,"Fun game to play with friends, feeds that loot-craving, and has some genuinely funny moments.  It's also colorful, creative, and a little more of a fresh shooter than your typical Grey Dirt Iraq simulator."
5053,One of the best co-ops I've played
5054,"This game is fun, Its like a upgraded fallout and you can shoot shit, drive shit, earn shit, pick up shit, and kill bosses. Overall i prefer the origional fallout but this is a good play if you are looking to sit down for an hour or two looking to feel productive for once in your life."
5055,p good
5056,Love it.
5057,"Honestly I love the borderlands series, 2 is by far my favorite and by far the superior game. This game is a lot of fun but the side quests get really boring and you need to do them if you ever want a chance at doing the main quest. On the other hand the loot is good and this is definitely a must for coop. Solo is very boring, so try to find someone to play with. Other than that this is a solid game with a good story. If you are deciding which one in the series to get though I would have to strongly recommend 2."
5058,Pretty f***ing fun if you ask me
5059,"Borderlands is one of those games that you continually pass over, content in your ignorance because you haven't ever played it so it can't possibly be any good...
One day; I finally cracked. If I'm honest, it was because I played Tales from the Borderlands and loved it so much I wanted to find out the origin story - without just reading up on it. So, out I went and bought the trilogy - and its probably the best decision I ever made. This game just, never stops - there's always something to do and it constantly delivers entertainment :)

I -HIGHLY- recommend this game to all; its fantastic."
5060,"This is the first review I have ever done and I have been with Steam for 12 years. I have to say this is one of the best games out there. It has without doubt stood the test of time. Every couple of years I pick this game up again and play it through to the end. I mean, how many more games can you do that with, not many. Yes the graphics are starting to be a bit outdated and the AI a little dumb but I think that's what gives it the appeal it has. I cannot recommend this game highly enough."
5061,"There ain't no rest for the wicked , just buy and shut your mouth"
5062,.
5063,"got this game for a dollar off humble bundle with other games as well, fuckin mint"
5064,"This couldnt be possibly better. If you dont like shooting games or you think you are bad at them, buy it. I completely hated shooting games and i still do but this one... This one is perfect."
5065,It takes 15 minutes to kill a bandit
5066,"Awesome first person RPG that has aged well despite having some caveates like opening the game's configuration file to change certain settings before its playable like vsync (you probably forgot to do it during your first time launching the game and have to play through the intro scene again) or even skipping the intro. Fun characters, great cel-shaded comic book character style art, beautiful open world with day-night cycles. Generic fetch quests/kill quests etc but all story driven. Having never played Borderlands past the demo when it first came out years ago, I regret not getting into the franchise much earlier. An absolute steal for $1."
5067,This game is slow and full of moments where I really didn't care.
5068,"Good game, but missing one key feature of all FPS games is auto-pickup of ammo and grenades.  I plan to make a mod to fix this if they don't fix it before I do.  As for the rest of the game it's pretty solid game.   The graphics are good, there not like witcher 3, but there better then some games I've seen.  Take for example Doom, the original graphics are dated compared to most modern games, but is well liked by many people.  When you play a game like Borderlands you play it for the art style not because it's FPS.  However, this does not excuse it from not play like a good FPS game.  I would still recommend pick this game up if you haven't already picked up borderlands 2, since BL2 plays alot better and still has that comic book art style.

Edit: I was looking at why borderlands series is rated M and I noticed it says ""mature humor"".  I think it would make more sense to say ""immature humor."""
5069,Don't play unless you have friends joining you for the entirety of your experience.  This is only worthwhile in multiplayer. The best gear is only available from the loot skill. Task get repetitive fast.
5070,Gotta love Borderlands
5071,Anything you would ever want in a game: shoot stuff and laugh like hell.
5072,"Disclaimer: This game is not for everyone.

BAsically when you start playing it feels boring but after a while it starts getting more fun since you start to understand it. But you don't have to play this game to understand the 2nd one."
5073,"Amazing art style, amazing gameplay, amazing music. It's a really good game and i love it. 10/10 would roadkill again. :)"
5074,Awesome game and looks really good!!!
5075,"great game, highly recommended :P"
5076,This did not age well. Only get this for nostalgia.
5077,It is a great game.
5078,ok
5079,"First I want to say Borderlands is a GREAT GAME. This game is a work of art and is very much worth playing. 
The reason I would not reccomend this is they REMOVED CO-OP SLIT SCREEN. You cannot play this game in the same room as your loved ones unless you have a LAN connection and two computers. 
This game is easily the BEST SPLIT SCREEN CO-OP GAME RELEASED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. WHY DID YOU TAKE THIS FEATURE OUT OF THE PC PORT!!!!!!! MADDNESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!
Go out and get an xbox or playstation I guess......as much as I hate to say it."
5080,"was a great game back when i had a win xp 32bit machine but now im on w7 64bit im got as far as level 18,crazies scrap yard and its endless crashes now,even after doing every single fix going.

so i have no choice but to mark it a negative,but obly so users of newer pc's dont waste their time trying to play it.

other borderlands games work fine"
5081,kk
5082,"I love this game, it is honestly one of my favorite games becaus eof its art style, and how different each playthrough can be.
"
5083,"Borderlands was one of the first games that I played that blurred the lines between FPS and RPG, and it was very entertaining.
And unlike things like the Fallout or Elder Scroll's series, this one cooperative, which from my point of view makes it even more fun.

The only thing I don't like, is that like most open world RPGs, the stuff you have to do can get really repetitive and tedious, specially the ""side-quests"", but even then, I think it is a good game."
5084,"I played through this on my Xbox 360 when this came out. I decided get it again and play it through on PC. I would recommend this to anyone even if they are not into FPS. It is like a Shooter RPG blend with lots of weapons, there is also a melee based character so there are a lot of different playstyles. 

Strongest feature in this game is the humour for me.
Worst Con for me would be the FOV, it feels very weird.
Also the game is capped at 62 FPS, not that it matters too much because there is no real PVP."
5085,"Review Solo Play:

After 18 hours in it and have beaten the second boss, I have absolute no motivation to keep on playing. The world is vast and empty, the quests feel like a single player mmorpg, and you require no skill at all. All you need is an apropriate level and a good enough gun, if you don't, skill won't help you either. The boss fights were quite fun, though.  Furthermore, bad port: No ingame vSync option, no FoV option, controls in shops and 'converstations'  sometimes won't work. Without FoV adaptation running made me feel uncomfortable.

If you happen to buy it (very) cheap, do it, try it out. If you play it with friends, it will be more fun (which game does not make more fun to play with friends, though). But I can't recommend it."
5086,"Bad port:

No FOV
No V-Sync
No way to turn off aim assist

"
5087,"Amazing game, timeless."
5088,"You'll probably need to apply an FOV fix, but it's a great game. 

Played through it twice on the Xbox 360, going to play through the whole series again on PC :D"
5089,"Really average port of a fairly decent (if a bit overrated) game.

Unskippable cutscenes, pre-rendered cutscenes displaying in what appears to be 480p, no windowed/borderless option, no v-sync, no turning off motion blur, no adjustable FoV, mouse sensitivity has 2 options (if you aren't willing to change your DPI) way too fast or way too slow, and to beat it all the game doesn't even feature antialiasing.

This game quite literally is a carbon copy of the console version, it's graphically no better than the console version even at max settings and I certainly don't remember the cutscenes looking as absolutely horrendous as they do in the PC PORT.

Skip, even if you are a fan of the autism that Borderlands broods just go with Borderlands 2, it's a much better port than this."
5090,"I don't usually play FPS, but jokes and other funny stuff just convinced me to finish it. It was a really nice game."
5091,"Borderlands 1 is a lot more basic than the sequels but it has charm in places they lack. Personally I feel this is the best in the series and well worth multiple playthroughs. I've played only a few hours on PC but have hundreds of hours on the xbox 360 version. 

This is a damn good game. You're doing yourself a disservice if you haven't played it."
5092,"Randomly Generated Gun System, Claptrap and a shit ton of enemies. 10 Claptraps / 10"
5093,"The best of the series in my opinion! 
Borderlands 2 and pre-sequel built on the random weapons generation, expanded DLC and new characters but still don't match Borderlands for badassitude!

I have played all characters in all playthroughs and would do it all again! Never get tired of the humour and addaptive gameplay!"
5094,Borderlands 2 ist better but this is still very good.
5095,"It's okay I guess
"
5096,"Borderlands is like the ""Diablo"" of FPS games. You are going to want to put in time trying to find the best weapons and items. The loot system is mostly random. They call it ""procedurally generated"". It means look everywhere and shoot everything to get more chances at the good stuff! The gun-play and progression system are really great. Even many years after it's release, Borderlands holds up as one of the best shooters ever. If you are interested in the series, start here. This original is better than it's sequel and pre-sequel."
5097,Play this non stop with friends and even family and we all love it
5098,Best game EVAHHHH!
5099,borbreralnds
5100,THIS GAME IS AWSOME
5101,"Great game. Get quests, kill enemies, find loot and receive reward from quest giver. That's the format and it's very enjoyable. The characters are interesting and funny. I like the wild west post-apocalyptic setting on another planet too. Still the best Borderlands in the series for me."
5102,This is where the series all started. Now i know that many people will disagree with this but i still think this is the best borderlands game.  It has funny characters and satisfying gameplay.  I will admit that its sequels fixed many issues this game has but it is definitely still a game that is worth your time.  P.S this game is not your friend.
5103,Collect guns. Kill things. Collect better guns. Kill bigger things.
5104,lilith is my main bitch
5105,Great game but $30 for a game made in 2009? I was going to buy 4 copies for some friends to try. Changed my mind pretty quick
5106,not feeling it. never getting these 3.5 hours back :(
5107,i absolutely  love this game
5108,"Bullet List of all the problems I had with this game:

It is never explained what the best levels are to do the DLCs

There is like 9 categories of guns, and each have like 5 subcategories. 90% of the guns in this game suck and the drop rate for weapons outside of the DLCs is horrible, which means you will struggle to understand what is good and why even after beating the game once.

Big Learning Curve

Classes not balanced. Lilith too OP. Brick too weak.

Listening to gun fire all the time is annoying.

This is a game that is hard to play for long periods of time. This is not an easy going game that you can play for thousands of hours like mount and blade warband, or team fortress 2, or farming simulator. This is a game that is non fluid and throws too much stuff at you if you play for an hour.

enemies do not scale to your level unless you beat the game twice.

mad moxxi's dlc is just horrid

secret armory dlc is driving simulator

Achievement farming takes aggravatingly long

edit: forgot to mention that the higher level you go, the more enemies spawn, which is annoying to have 20 people shooting at you all the time later on."
5109,"Years old but still a solid game.

Massive maps to explore, ridiculous amounts of loot, almost unlimited gun variety & decent fps mechanics."
5110,"your mom gay
"
5111,"Fantastic shooter with RPG Elements.
Graphic is a super cool cell shading, the gameplay is odd at start (weird feeling with weapons), but as soon as you get comfortable it becomes super fun, the story is so funny you can't totally miss it.

Grab it, play it, have tons of fun with it!"
5112,oh this game! had this in every released format and for all it's imperfections I still smile when I see it in my collection !
5113,tis some good shit
5114,"Boring, repetitive and generic gunplay, bland characters and horrible optimization.

also;

boo hoo muh poor little ""plot-essential"" robot is huuurt so fix it with this conviniently placed repair kit that is conviniently marked with the compass"
5115,hey this is pretty good
5116,Very good game tho i think borderlands 2 is better and then the pre sequal #MordecaiForTheWin
5117,Even if You are not a shooter type this game is a recommended one.
5118,Eski bir oyun olmasina ragmen eskidigini cok hissetirmeyen guzel bir oyun.
5119,Two words: bazillion guns.
5120,"I've always had fun playing this game, but after not playing it for a few years (I had it on Xbox 360 but lost the copy), I forgot just how much I appreciated it.
One thing I like about Borderlands is how it fuses RPG and FPS -- and that is one of their main selling points. I'm quite fond of adding abilities and skills to your arsenal when shooting a bunch of stuff. The wide range of quests keeps me busy and enjoying more than just the storyline (although the plethora of fetch quests does get a bit boring). So, I tend not to do many fetch quests unless they are required or get good loot (for example, one of the ""bazillion"" weapons that is actually worth having).
I do enjoy Borderlands. I suggest you check it out if you can and haven't already."
5121,h
5122,"tl;dr Kill things to get better gear to kill more things and get even better gear with RPG elements, story be damned. 8.5/10
-also this is my first written review so this will get messy.


While the starting missions of the game can be quite slow, which especially true when you've played through them 20+ times like I have. Much of my experience lies with the Xbox 360 version, where I wasted 1900 hours on my first Roland character farming for the best possible end game loot, only to all be lost when I converted to PC. Despite this, I bought the game again because of how much fun it is.

Once you venture out from the first ""hub"" location of Fyrestone, the game starts to get good very quickly, aside from Mad Mel (to this day I still cheese through because cars are made of paper). You can choose to play as one of four characters, all of which are super fun to play, my favorite being Brick the Beserker. None of the classes are better than one another, aside from the Hunter for PVP (He has a skill that completely negates shield protection), but that was not a focus of the game.

The main drive of the game is the loot system, which was a drug for me, hence the 1900 hours on the Xbox 360 for one character. The feeling that you get when finding that overpowered weapon is addicting. That said, it almost becomes a requirement to do some grinding for weapons by opening chests multiple times. Some weapons are useless, such as the Edrian and Rocket classes. They fall flat when compaired to the other weapon types.

Speaking of the other weapon types, some are much more powerful than others it almost becomes a must have. Such as the Anarchy class for SMGS, which are bullet hoses that do massive damage (x4 Multiplier), tearing even the largest foe to pieces in seconds. Compair this to a Thumper class SMG, that has low recoil but shoots very slowly, giving the enemy time to write their will and eat their last supper before they die.

The story is alright, though I may be biased from so many subsequent playthroughs that I end up rushing through the main missions as fast as the game will allow me to get back to the side quests. These are not required to progress through the game, but they give a level boost without the need of grinding. Ignoring all side quests will require you to grind enemies to level up a could of times. I end up 100% completing all quests anyway, so this is a minor complaint from me but may irk some people. 

! SPOILER WARNING ! On a final note about the story, the ending [spoiler] Is garbage, it made the entire experience seem like a waste. The final boss fight is incredibly easy unless you have very crap loot.    [/spoiler]

My gripes with the game begin with the visuals, this game has not aged well. Most of the games locations are brown deserts or rusty townships devoid of much colour. Much of the environment isnt well detailed, yet it does not run well in areas with many objects. (My pc is an i5-4670 with GTX 1070 Stock, and I drop down to 25 fps sometimes, max settings 1440p) Most of the areas though are barren, resulting in a smooth 90 FPS for me.

There is also a strange FPS lock at 62, which will cause screen tearing on 60hz monitors. I have one that is 144hz, and the cap can be removed in the game's files with no ill effects to gameplay. There is also a lack of a FOV slider, with the default FOV being 60 in this game. I get headaches with low FOV, so this is a big issue for me. Once again this can be altered in the game's files, but the FOV is reset when entering a car. My fix for this is to bind a change FOV command to W so it resets whenever I start moving.

My issues with the game do not deter from the experience when fixed, granting this game a solid 8.5/10. One of my favorite games ever made.

SHORT OVERVIEW OF DLCS

[u] The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned	[/u]
- Very good DLC, funny characters and entertaining quests. Highly recomended.

[u] The Secret Armory of General Knoxx	[/u]
- The missions are entertaining, but there is too much driving. Recomended because this has everything needed for entertaining end game.

[u] Claptrap's Robot Revolution	[/u]
- Great main missions, with side missions that are not as interesting. Some of the achievements are grind fests, recomended if in GOTY edition or on sale.

[u] Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot	[/u]
-This is NOT a good DLC, only useful for the bank feature. Only get this if you buy the GOTY edition. The definition of grind fest, with no saves. (I completed this DLC on Xbox 360, took 3 days of 10 hour play sessions).

edit; do not write reviews at 5:45 AM, too many mistakes.
double edit; Remaster announced, this review was for the OG release"
5123,iz very gud gaem
5124,"Can be a bit repetitive, however, still a fun game, love the story and the jokes. Ending was a bit flat, but the sequals made up for that."
5125,"This game does not launch it at all, it just generates C++ error messages."
5126,"Good game overall, but gets repetitive."
5127,"If you played 2 and the pre-sequel, i cant guaratee you will like the first game. As someone who played this game when it first game out, i highly recommend this. This game is alittle more mature then the next 2, and its certainly less colorful. If you come from 2 and TPS, the feeling of the game will throw you off because you are alittle slower in 1. Its still amazing, but its definetly for a more mature audience."
5128,"Borderlands is the first of its kind. The first FPS RPG. That's right, first person shooter role playing game. It's like Skyrim had a baby with Call of Duty and the child made a guest appearance on the adult swim channel. AWESOME!!!

Note: this review will not be nearly as in-depth as my review for Borderlands 2, Borderlands' sequel. This is because Borderlands, while fun, stands very far back in the shadow of its arguably far superior sequel. 

Borderlands is an FPS RPG set on a far-off planet in space. Players are given the choice of one of four characters to play as: Mordecai, Roland, Brick, and Lilith. Each character has their own unique attributes and abilities, making them each a separate class that fits most every player's style. Mordecai specializes in sniper rifles and pistols. His special ability allows him to send out his bird named Bloodwing, which will fight alongside him in combat. Roland specializes in rifles(?), and his special ability summons a turret to fight alongside him in combat. Brick specializes in LMGs(?) and melee weapons, and I think his special ability allows him to go into a melee rampage essentially. I don't remember much about Lilith, but I know her special ability allows her to phase walk, or something along those lines. Either way, each class fits a given role in terms of weapon specialities and combat playstyles. Each character also posseses their own unique skill trees, where leveling up will grant points to put into the skill tree in order to enhance certain aspects of the character (such as adding rockets to the turret, or allowing Bloodwing to attack more and more times). The actual gameplay revolves around a typical RPG style, where the player is given a story mission that they must complete and many optional side missions. Missions include tasks such as retrieving items, killing enemies, and venturing into un-explored areas of the world. Players kill enemies with their guns (obviously) and can pick up extra ammo either from random drop piles or from enemy kill drops. Killed enemies will also sometimes drop weapons, which the player can pick up to constantly improve their arsenal. Weapon values range from Common to Legendary and Pearlescent. Legendary and Pearlescent weapons often have unique effects that make them highly sought-after, such as infinite ammo or shotguns that shoot rockets instead of shotgun shells. Once the story is finished, the player can either continue playing that session or re-start the story with the same character and the same weapons as before, causing the game to start at a higher difficulty as well. The player can also start a brand new game with a new character for a different experience. The game also highly encourages 4-player co-op to add even more fun and excitement to your adventure, which includes dueling players for weapons, reviving each other in a fight, arguing over who should get a certain weapon because you got the legendary last time so it's my turn now, and more.

PROS:
-Highly entertaining story.
-Memorable characters with clever dialogue. 
-Delivers exceptionally well on the FPS RPG aspect.
-Replay value.
-Good graphics, and a very unique art style.
-Satisfying gameplay.
-Fun to play with friends, but also enjoyable to play solo.

CONS:
-While good, Borderlands 2 is better on many aspects.
-Skill tree isn't very interesting. Most skills are very basic ""passive"" skills, such as ""More loot"" or ""Higher fire rate upon killing an enemy"" or ""Higher sniper rifle damage"".
-Legendaries aren't amazingly legendary, just kinda legendary.
-While it has replay value, the story isn't dynamic enough to make subsequent playthroughs very interesting, and the search for legendary weapons and raid bosses isn't great either.

Score: 8/10. Play Borderlands before you get Borderlands 2. Wait for Borderlands to be on sale, but definitely play it. It will give you so much background to start off of when you go to play Borderlands 2 that it is honestly worth playing. Plus, at the end of the day, it's a really fun game."
5129,"Original, colorful and great RPG shooter with a right taste of humor. Unfortunatelly, the accuracy of weapons does not satisfy as it could.
9/10"
5130,"Nostalgia. I was 5 years old when I played this. Now I'm 13. Man, time flies"
5131,Good ol' game
5132,one of my all time favorites!
5133,"what a stinker. put this one in the trash, fellas!"
5134,great action cool graphicks
5135,"A unique take on first person shooters by adding RPG leveling elements to the mix.  At some times I thought it took away from the experience by occasionally having bullet sponge enemies, but it was worth it for the unique style it presented."
5136,"It's a good game that aged well. It manages to keep its style and charm over the years and almost makes me forgive Gearbox for Colonial Marines, almost. It's just as good as you remember, so play it again."
5137,"Unfortunately, the game has twice lost my saved character. Losing a level 3 character the first time, and now a level 13. I don't have the enthusiasm to create a third character, only for the game to lose it."
5138,Critical Bee-atch!!!
5139,"I love this game. I've bought it on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC. I don't normally like games with graphics like this one, but I love the characters and the way they talk. This game is a classic if you ask me. I wish they would redo it on PS4 so I could play it on there also. Even after buying the next 2 I still go back and play this one."
5140,i love it so will you plus(doing this for badges)
5141,"Borderlands is so damn fantastic that make me don't wanna stay on planet earth any more.
I've spent thousands of hours on Borderlands though i dont have records on steam."
5142,"Broderbunds is a pretty solid series, there are some frustrating design elements in each one but nothing that makes them unplayable. The quirky humor and the action come together fairly nicely, some scenarios will frustrate because they seem to pop up out of nowhere with horrendously powerful enemies, but the rest of the time you will have a solidly fun time meandering about and collecting giblets while you blast men, animals, manimals, robots, and anything else that has the gall to step up to you like you weren't going to put an electrified, exploding, acid bullet into each of its kidneys.

Original Specific: This one may not be as polished as the others because, obviously it's the first one any they were just sort of figuring themselves out, but it's still a damn solid game. Mordecai is far and above my favorite character in the series as a whole, even if he's not as humorous as some of the later options."
5143,"Good game. funny dialouge. and tons of missions for non stop fun
"
5144,What can I say...buy the game. You wont ever regret playing this game. It has a dark sense of humor that I love. I played this game when I was just starting out with a decent pc and it blew my mind. I couldn`t wait to get home from school to play. Weekend going to a friends house for a LAN party and playing Borderlands the whole weekend. Now I`m done with school and I still like playing it from time to time. Newer and better Borderlands games have been released since but remember where it all started.
5145,A fun Action RPG where you pick 1 of 4 characters with special abilities and go on one hell of a ride finding a special vault. I do recommend playing Co-op with friends as it makes the game a bit more entertaining and playable compared to going in alone.
5146,"The classic co-op/rpg/loot gathering/raid bossing extravaganza that started it all, a wonderfully made game. 

Not quite as polished has Borderlands 2 but is still amazing in its own right and tells a unique story. If you are coming from Borderlands 2 be prepared for alot more serious tone and a more ""dull"" feel. I mean dull as in the game is not boring, just the world is not as vibrant or alive feeling as the second game. 

You pick from one of 4 characters to play as and level them up through a story and lots of side missions. Their is absolutely hours of content here, and its wonderful. Each character as a unique ability they can use every so often and has you level up you get skill points to increase your various stats and ability. TONS of guns, and I mean TONS. You'll find new weapons all the time that all have their unique quirks and wasy to use them. There's so much to explain about what borderlands is it is kind of hard to do so without writting a whole book on it. Grab some friends too and you'll enjoy it even more as you all play a different class and go to town on the bad guys."
5147,One of my favourite game series <3
5148,"Totally a game worth buying if you're into the whole Sci-Fi FPS RPG genre mash-up. It may be 8 years old, but I can see why so many people played it back in the day. If I'd had Steam and the funds with which to buy it, I would have played the living daylights out of this. Bought this during the sale back around Independence Day and I can say I'm having a blast playing it :)

I will say that reload times for some weapons are a little annoying, especially when being swarmed by Skags -_- but other than the being out numbered (my fault entirely 99.99% of the time), I can say that once I've finished this game and the DLC, I'll be headed right toward the sequel and the pre-sequel."
5149,"Why should you get this game? Why not. Grab this during a steam sale, get a buddy or two online, and prepare to embark on a fun journey of loot and trust issues!"
5150,I can't count the number of times I've played through this game. It's one of my all time favorite series.
5151,better dialogue than the 2nd game
5152,"This is a great first person shooter and role playing game that has taken the best of both genres. It has a ton of guns, hilarious dialog and scenarios, all set on a futuristic dystopian planet called Pandora. The shooting mechanics and gameplay are top notch, along with traditional RPG levelling up and experience systems and even quests/sidequests that both facilitate the story and the lore of the game world make this is a great game.

9.5/10"
5153,"This is a great game. funny characters, loot whore friendly gameplay.   and great fun with friends in co-op."
5154,A co-op classic that would be recommended if its sequel didn't do what it does so much better
5155,"Borderlands itself is okay - and if there was no sequels, it would be great. 

If you want to do all three, i suggest you don't even try BL2 or the pre-sequel before trying BL1. 

The reason being that the fatures added in the latter 2 that are not present in the first one really tend to spoil it - especially the missing mini-map. The other thing that takes getting used to is the field of view - it seems like you are constantly zoomed in.

 Defintiely the weakest of the 3, good if you want the whole story, but otherwise I'd suggest skipping it now, and just going for the other two.

Leaves me in the state between yes and no, but leaning slightly more towards no..."
5156,"The game is funny from the first mission untill the final one of the main plot. The side quests are just as good, basically if you finish the main plot you can still have fun and blow stuff up in different maps .

Chose your character and go on, explore Pandora :)"
5157,"This game is fantastic! It has a great story, millions of weaponry, and humor! It has four unique characters to choose from and many different skills you can assign to them. This game will keep you busy due to all the different legendary and pearlescent items! If your looking for a fun time, get this game!"
5158,all most 10 years on and still a superb game!
5159,"i am SURPRISED, i have never did a review on this game .. guess i was caught up in just playing it .. a must get, the character lines are funny as well as unforgetable .. one of which comes to mind is General Knoxx .. his lines in both the game story line and the Roboassassin (robolution) DLC  are one of a kind.
~NativeOne"
5160,The story might not have been the best but its still a great game
5161,the game is just really fun but I ama huge fan of the whole series so thats just me maybe
5162,"Graphics are amazing for a 2009 game. A lot darker and more difficult than Borderlands 2 but the game suffers from many issues with age. The field of view is set to a measly ~70 degrees meaning you struggle to calculate distances sufficiently at higher resolutions. Aiming is absolutely terrible by modern standards, and the mouse is far too sensitive. While your interface is nice and simple, it finds ways to annoy you such as asking you to confirm every purchase, meaning refilling your ammo can take minutes. In multiplayer, ammo seems to be a huge issue to sustain in early missions as your early guns will spend most of it on a wall 3 metres every side of your target. Also XP doesn't seem to have been tested for multiplayer either as you quickly end up 4 levels behind standard bandits even after doing every side mission possible.

While no where near as fun as the second, the game is still a must for fans of the series as the story begins here."
5163,eh
5164,Best  Borderlands game ever
5165,"Really fun game, buy the entire saga, it is worth every penny"
5166,"If you like open-world, genre hybrid games, with tons of guns and endless action, then this game is for you!"
5167,"[h1][b][u]BORDERLANDS - A LEGENDARY GAME[/u][/b][/h1]
[b]Boderlands is a First Person Shooter with roleplay elements. You pick one of four classes and beat a campaign. The game has a loot-system for weapons, with a rarity color code (rare to common: pearlescent, orange, purple, blue, green, white). You can play it solo or koop with your friends.

Borderlands (and its DLCs) is for me one of the best games I've ever played in my life - and I played alot games. I spent far over 1000 hours playing this (nonsteam and steam). I discovered almost everything in the Borderlands except some super rare weapons. I played all Characters to maximum Level multiple times and never got bored.

[h1]Appearance - Graphics & effects, modeling, and general design[/h1]

Borderlands was never meant to be a breakthrough regarding graphics in the first place. The game designers surely experimented with the cell shading and tried to give the game a unique appearence. If you look close you will find the textures to be a swirling mud of blurred pictures. But when you look at the composition you will notice that almost everything fits and gives you a pleasent feeling of a self-contained world. The effects are rather mediocre but fit into the overall design. The modeling was quite a success. The characters are unique and well made. Not even one model in this world felt utterly odd or unfitting to me. The weapons' look depends on the parts they are made of.  Generally speaking they look okay - not awesome, but okay. The Borderlands themselves - although they are really dull - make you feel like being on an alien planet, but somehow not foreign at the same time. The scrap lying around, the broken huts and houses and the rocks and deserts have their own charm and cause wanderlust inside me. To sum it up: The appearance is quite good.

[b][i]Appearance[/i]:     8/10[/b]

[h1]Sound - Background music, sound effects and voices[/h1]

This part is sort of a controversial issue. You can't really score a subject that is so dependend on your personal taste. The background music is fitting. I would never hear this kind of music in my car, but it fulfills its use in the game. The sound effects are well made but nothing too special either. Weapons sound mostly like you would expect it. The voices and the general dubbing is  awesome. Every character has a unique voice and vocal expression. In a nutshell the sounds are fitting but no price winner.

[b][i]Sound[/i]:     6/10[/b]

[h1]Story - Main quest, side quests[/h1]

The public opinion on this issue is, that the story turns out to be the main weak point. I kind of understand this when looking at the storyline of the core game. The plug in the game - finding the vault - is a great basic idea, but was not implemented as well as I expected from a game like this. The ending of the core game is somehow disappointing. When it comes to the DLCs ""The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned"" and ""The Secret Armory of General Knoxx"" I must show appreciation for the stories, they are actually nice. The quest design is neither bad nor good. Some quest remind me of MMORPG quests like ""Collect 50 Crystals in this cave"", ""Kill 10 enemies of this kind"" and so on.  I personally like especially the ones that imply boss fights. The Borderlands itselves are a model for alot stories and quests. Sadly, the Quests and the stories have the worst quality in Borderlands, but that is not a reason to refuse the game.

[b][i]Story[/i]:     4/10[/b]

[h1]Controls - General controls, Menus, HUD[/h1]

The controls are relatively common and intuitive. One thing I have to critizise here is the control of the vehicle which you have to steer with your mouse movement. The game menu is intuitive, too. The worst is the inventory and the charakter information. Your loot will appear in your inventory sorted from rare to common. There is no way to sort the inventory otherwise. You won't get a quickinfo about the weapons except you hover with your cursor over their names. The HUD design is nothing new in this genre but serves the needs.

[b][i]Controls[/i]:     6/10[/b]

[h1]AI - Bosses and Enemies[/h1]

Enemies actually have following options: 
[list]
[*] run and shoot
[*] stand and shoot
[*] get cover
[*] run
[*] throw grenades
[*] stand and taunt
[/list]
Thats it. Don't expect more. There is no group tactic or anything like it. BUT you won't miss it. So I don't critizise this point too much. The bosses are also straight forward with little changes and surprises. The boss-design in general is okay. The endboss is [spoiler]kind of disappointing and very, very boring. You don't need a tactic and it's not even hard to beat him.[/spoiler]

[b][i]AI[/i]:     5/10[/b]

[h1]Programming - Bugs[/h1]

They acutally did a good job here. You won't face game breaking bugs. There are just some minor problems. For example: They placed two weapon chests into another in The Secret Armory of General Knoxx. The only bugs that have an impact are exploits that help the player. There is a way to beat the secret enemy [spoiler]Crawmerax in the General Knoxx DLC[/spoiler] without effords and there is a way to repeat the [spoiler]loot run in the General Knoxx DLC[/spoiler] without finishing the quest. 

[b][i]Programming[/i]:     9/10[/b]

[h1]Gameplay - Content, weapons, overall experience[/h1]

Finally I reached the supreme discipline of the game. The content and gameplay ist just awesome. Yes there is not much of a story in the game, but the gameflow, the lootsystem and the FPS element is absolutely perfect for me. You always have something to do. Killing the enemies give you a pleasent feeling, especially because the game serves a good mix of one hit enemies and (sometimes) bulletsponges. And the loot... maaaan I love it. Every chest you open could contain a top tier weapon. And these weapons feel like weapons (in contrary to BL2) that actually do damage and have accuracy. It feels like the Diablo 2 LoD loot drop. This makes the game highly addictive. This whole point is the part where Borderlands 2 sucks like no other game. Borderlands 2 has almost only bulletsponges, really messed up the weapons which have no noteworthy damage, accuracy and recoil which makes BL2's loot system really disappointing. You are forced to grind brainlessly until you somehow get a drop that is not 100% total crap. Borderlands 1 did everything right in this case. This makes the overall experience perfect for me.

[b][i]Gameplay[/i]:     10/10[/b]

[h1]Summed up[/h1]

The whole thing is an artwork in my eyes. It may lack in some points if you look too closely at the single disciplines, but in a nutshell this game has everything I wanted: A FPS-Lootgame with a rewarding experience. It's the Diablo 2 of the shooter genre. In contrary Borderlands 2 is the Diablo 3 of the shooter genre, and I don't like Diablo 3 very much due to the disappointing rewards. Borderlands is one of my absolute favourites. I strongly recommend to buy this game. If you love playing Borderlands 2 I won't recommend to buy Borderlands 1 because you probably are infected by the brainless hypetrain public opinion that Borderlands 2 is the better game because it's newer. Newer is not always better.

5168,"One of the best games ever, it is a MUST HAVE. Great dynamics and overall gameplay. Lots of stuff to do"
5169,"This is where all the madness began, in a good way of course. Visuals not as we know em now, but still game can't stop to amaze with its insanity."
5170,"This game is a great experience. It's perfect to play when I have some time to kill while waiting for my next class, but also challanging enough to keep me guessing and on my toes.

10000000% encourage you to buy"
5171,"I've played this game with my partner, and it's massively enjoyable and engaging. There's kind of a storyline and a charachter build, but that's really not the point. The point is the combat mechanism, and the looting / selling / buying new weapons. It is most definitely all about the guns in this game. Combat rifles, machine guns, sub-machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, revolvers, pistols, rocket launchers, eridian weapons. Seriously, there are a LOT of guns in this game. Discovering a good weapon stash is mighty satisfying. And then comes the desire to find broken claptraps which you help fix and eventually grant you extra SDU space for your backpack, so you could collect more guns. And of course, there are also shields, grenade mods, class mods, and many other things to collect and improve. It sounds lacking, but the gameplay is just amazing, and you find that you just can't stop playing it."
5172,great game
5173,"Very repetetive, story is bad and forgettable (was there a story??), characters are mostly forgettable, animations are stiff, weapons all feel and sound same-y wih a few exceptions, the ending to the campaign is garbage, the The Secret Armory of General Knoxx DLC ending is way better. 

Some achievements are near impossible to do solo without friends/people in CO-OP and/or insane amount of hours to grind for good weapons and level.

Not a fan of the cel-shaded look either, but that's just me."
5174,"I no lifed this game back when it came out on the Xbox 360. Now after years of not playing it, I decided to give it a shot. Its so much fun. 11/9 IGN"
5175,"This game is not good. If you want a game like this, you can find a buttload elsewhere. Do not recommend."
5176,Old but gold.
5177,I really like this game and think it is better than the sequel.
5178,It's shit.
5179,"For best results, play with your IRL friends."
5180,i like it
5181,"For free, this game is completely worth it"
5182,"The best game, its a little bugged like every game , but the final boss was awesome , i finished the story in 20h i think or 15, very good game im gonna play the second one and the third , recommand
"
5183,It's gud and addicting but not for long
5184,hi
5185,Nice.
5186,Best Co-op game ever.. Also best friendship destroyer.. That's MY FUCKING LEGENDARY!!!
5187,Tons of replayability and always more loot to gain. Even better when you throw friends into the mixture.
5188,"This game is acttually pretty fun and i enjoy playing it!
It becomes addictive after a couple hours

9/10"
5189,"Simply Icredible Game !!! !0 Stars out of 10 Stars, but that is  not enough to say... Everything is patched, works well, and Steam now allows us to do multiplayer  with a terrific game that had it originally but lost it when it got older and they closed the servers... Do not stop... Listen up there are terrific goodies out for this increadibly goo FPS and Group FPS game....

Over and Out....................

"
5190,"Well the single player campaign is kinda boring if you alone, probably gather some of your friends to complete the single player, as of the multiplayer is dead..."
5191,"7/10. Played through this game 3 times in total in local co-op with friends.  I really enjoyed the environment, the visuals, gun play and the progression of Borderlands. I do wish there were fewers quests and more open exploration, as the ""go there and find 3 buckets of turds"" routine quests gets old. However, the combat and item (loot) progression as you advance through the game is highly satisfying. 

The overall story of a secret ""vault"" is well... whatever. Play Borderlands 2 for a better story. I recommend both. Each worth $20 and $1000.00 of my time on their own (I figure my spare time is worth $50 / h).

Overall, very immresive and replayable game, particularily if one utilizes and replays with different class / character in each play through."
5192,"Borderlands is an action co-op RPG set upon Pandora, a wasteland where only the tough survive and the traitorous succeed. You are a vault hunter, and have come to Pandora seeking the vault along with the endless riches it brings, but there are many who stand in your way.

Pros:
-The gameplay is great. Essentially a first person shooter with RPG elements thrown in and a good amount of humour makes this game one the best I've come across in this combination
-Random weapon system, so each weapon you come across has different statistics and a vast array of explosions, lightning strikes and overall chaos make each weapon a great experience
-A lot of enemies and great balance and difficulty scaling, offering a great balance between fight and flight depending on how you like to play
-Graphics is good for a 2009 game, although not the best, it still holds up well today. The slight cartoonish feel makes the game feel original
-Characters are memorable and well developed, and you'll remember each of them for their own witty comments (except CL4P-TR4P, he is annoying as all hell)
-Each of the DLC adds a great amount of play, with all 4 adding about another 30-45 hours of playtime. (Goodluck with The Underdome)
-It has Steam Achievements, which are all reasonable difficulty to achieve.
-Co-op is amazing, and wrecking havoc and blasting bandits to hell with your friends is great fun.

Cons:
-I honestly can't think of anything, except maybe steam overlay not working sometimes

This is one of the best and most enjoyable games I've ever played, either alone or co-op, it is definitely worth your time!
10/10

5193,9/10 Too much Spiderants
5194,Bloodwing is the best thing about this game.
5195,"Mhhhhhhh

Que dire à part, un gros GG de la part de 2K Games ?
un jeu avec des graphismes spéciaux mais accrocheurs,
des mécaniques super bien foutues

Une rejouabilitée énorme, un panel d'armes de fou, des extensions plus complètes les unes que les autres (bon, sauf l'underdome qui est un peu chiant)

Pour un jeu de 2009, sérieux, on se marre ! 
A 4 c'est le big bordel et je ne vous parle même pas de la boucle 2 XD C'est un enfer et c'est tellement réservé aux tryharder ! J'adore ça xD

Si vous adorez viser et qu'en plus vous adorez améliorer votre personnage avec un arbre de Talent, alors ce FPS/RPG est fait pour vous !

Profitez, biiiitch !"
5196,"Love it. Spent lots of hours, got attached to the characters, and love the humor. I highly recommmend it."
5197,"Great Gameplay, not enough story"
5198,Great game 10/10 would play again
5199,"Not really an RPG, but a quested based shooter. The missions/quests do weave together into an interesting story, although, it does feel like a game of murder hobos. That's not a bad thing. For hours of mindless violence and explosive fun."
5200,"Lacks the story and dialogue that bl2 and pre-sequel has but still pretty entertaining like the newer borderlands games.
Some slight improvements have been made in the sequels that work better than in this game, like moving around, driving, inventory comparing etc minor things."
5201,This great series started here in this madhouse of guns.  Even though the first entry isn't as polished as later titles it's still worth picking up whether you skipped it in favor of later entries or are thinking about starting your journey to Pandora for the first time.
5202,came to this game late - like the art style and humour
5203,"Really enjoyed this game pretty fun the 1st time around. Its down side is that you have to beat it a second time to actually complete it, think that the creatos got lazy and just said fuck it end it here and add another difficulty to it. Over all this is a great play its better if u go in it co_op so i defently give the a thums up"
5204,Still my favorite borderlands and I haven't even finished 2 yet.
5205,I love this game. Personally I think my boyfriend would love it too >w< but he doesn't have a steam so I digress. I've played it outside of steam and I really enjoyed it. I'm glad I own it on steam now. Pretty happy that I own the game for myself! It's defiantly a game worth getting!!
5206,"This game is fun, fun, fun......!
It's all about guns, guns, guns.....!
With friends, it's, even more, fun to play."
5207,"One of better games i played so far. Have humor,have difficulty,loot,intresting bosses and enemys and moust importantly have claptrap :). Game doesnt lack on a lot of diffrent wepons and sideqests. Bl1 drawbacks are kinda weak stroy that have lot qestions and unexpleined parts of story(witch are  answered in bordernalds 2). Bl1 offers a good co-op and for every aditional player (up to 4 of em) makes all enemys stronger. Since this game is all abouth loot its recommendabel to know locations of chests(but i recommend to you buy rather general knoxx dlc for best loot also cause your level cap). Sideqests are moustly enyoyabel to be done and some tells a part of story of some chaters and pandora (but there are also some extremly boring ones). Well long story short if you like games that have humor, loot and games taht you just can enyoy with friends and have some fun (unles you considering games that are kinda difficult not funny then dont buy it and if you are doing moxxie dlc or arena on general knoxx you will feal misrabel doing em trust me) this is a game for you but well watch your level casue if you are too low level enemies will preaty much rape you :)."
5208,"One of the best games I played so far. The humor is awsome, ganeplay great.
only the graphics could be a bit better; Its an older game, but it checks out. I recommend playing this gem bevore playing the 2nd part, wich is even better, it´s much more fun."
5209,"A lot of fun for both solo and multiplayer playthroughs. Tons of loot and fun shooting action, with a solid story to back up the gameplay. The art style adds to the experience in a positive way. Memorable sequences, and Claptrap is hilarious."
5210,REALLY bought this cuz of the SICK UNIQUE art design in the game. PRETTY INTENSE game style with all the FPS ACTION but found it wasn't REALLY my type. STILL enjoyed the game doe 5/7
5211,"I loved this game when it came out way back in 2009. It was a fresh break from Call of Duty and Halo at the time.
It hasn't aged all that well. (old game engine, graphics aren't great and the contols are a little sluggish)
The first few levels can be a grind especially when you need to aquire better gear and level up your character to overcome some challanging levels and bosses.

The game can be really fun in Co-op with friends. It's recommended to play this game with friends otherwise you can die real easily without a buddy to help you out.
Going solo can be done as long as you're willing to spend a lot of time grinding it out for good loot and level up. Be sure to finish side missions to get bonus EXP, loot and cash.

The DLCs greatly expand the game and they do add a lot of replayability. (Zombie Island of Dr. Ned and The Secret Armory of General Knoxx are the best)

Overall, I greatly enjoyed this game. It's a Loot-and Shoot game. You shoot bandits/creatures, get loot and shoot some more! 
You're a Vault Hunter, you've come to Pandoa to find an ancient vault rumored to hold treasure and stuff. Grab a gun and shoot your way to it!

Want to run around an alien world infested with bandits, deadly creatures, fight an evil corporate militay and get tons of loot in the process? Get Borderlands!
I recommend this game!"
5212,"pull the trigger, bullets come out, thing dies, you level up. there aren't a whole lot of mindlessly fun games with deep combat systems that you can play without paying attention, but this is one of the best. if you want something you can play while also watching and keeping up with the game of thrones episode that's on in the background, this is it. 10/10"
5213,When you have to mod the game to enable Vsync to make it playable 10/10 worst console port I've ever seen would do again. Put hundreds of hours in on Xbox 360
5214,"This is one of the games I'd play with my friends, If I had any"
5215,"[h1]Very repetitive game with boring shooting[/h1]

I tried to play this game many times in solo mode (never in the coop) and every time I got bored too quickly with its bland brownish graphic, extremely repetitive and boring side quests and most important uninteresting shooting.

[h1]Graphic[/h1]
This game use Cel-Shading to make it looks like a comic book, I can play with it despite I didn’t like it, however, the whole world just looks kinda bland and flat with its monotone colors in general. Worlds in Fallout 3, Rage and Mad Max looked much more interesting.

[h1]Quests[/h1]
The main quest is not interesting; you just need to find some vault in the desert and open it. There are some dialogues but I was not invested in them because they were not interesting.

The side quests are what I did not like. Almost all of them are just “go there and kill\deliver\find something” what became relay repetitive and boring too quickly so I just start to skip them entirely.

[h1]Shooting[/h1]
Another disappointing thing is a completely flat and uninteresting shooting. I did not ""feel"" any feedback from shooting a gun like in Rage or more recent Wolfenstein and Doom games. The sound of the shooting is also bland and all guns sound like a cheap firecracker.

And most of that, in the game where there are 17,750,000 variants of weapons, a player can not craft the weapon that he wants for himself, Instead, the player is stuck with procedurally generated garbage.

[h1]Exploring[/h1]
To make a player enjoy the exploration of the world, the game should encourage a player to do so by rewarding him with rare/valuable loot, interesting story elements or beautiful scenery. A good example of this (but not only one) system is all Fallout games, Prey (2017) and Mad Max.

However, In this game, you will only see a bland monotone landscape or find a random loot in the form of another bland shooting gun which you will anyway replace after a couple of hours.

So for me, this game is the quintessence of blandness."
5216,Great Game :O
5217,"TL:DR Even though its been surpassed by its better sequel, Borderlands is still a good option especially if you have a friend or two to lay it with.

Full Version:
Borderlands is a cross between FPS and loot collecting ARPGs. You pick one of four characters, each with different strengths and abilities, and travel around the crazy and dangerous world of Pandora completing quests and looking for better loot. While the game is more geared towards co-op between up to 4 players it is beatable solo. You can play alongside randoms but I think the best way to enjoy the game is to co-op with friends.

There is a crazy amount of different weapons and gear that gets dropped by enemies. While they tend to fall into a small few categories like pistol, shotgun sniper rifle etc each weapon has different stats and effects which leads to loads of different cominations. 

I found it to be a pretty good game even if it is a few years old now. Theres a load of different locations and enemy types and plenty of quests. Also the neverending quest for better loot is motivation to keep going. The DLC expansions included in the game are all quite good with the exception of the Mad Moxxi Underdome which is just fighting enemy waves in an arena. The slightly cel shaded look of Borderlands gives it that unique look that the Borderlands series has and even though this game is a few years old it hasnt aged as badly as some other games from that period.

There are a few negatives though. The main one being the online community is almost dead. Most online players seemed to be low level when I played so while you might get a good match early in the game, it is harder to find high levelled players for later on. So as I've said earlier if you want to play this co-op, then playing with friends is the best option.

Another minor annoyance was the lack of fast travel points in the DLC. In the main game you unlock a fast travel point in each area you enter but the DLC has none. This is annoying as if you quit the game while playing the DLC you'll always restart back at the main hub for the DLC even if you quit in another area. It's a minor thing but it can be quite annoying when you're playing the DLC.

Overall Borderlands is still a pretty good game even though its been eclipsed by its sequel."
5218,If you just want to shoot things uninterrupted for hours on end with three of your mates then this game is for you. It also has no bad memes and pop culture references like Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel.
5219,"I used to hate this game.  I was fairly notorious for hating this game.  Then again, I played the Xbox 360 version with a friend and we were bored and I got motion sick.  It wasn't until later in my life that I discovered PC gaming and FOV sliders.

I decided to give the game another whirl.  Full Disclosure, I don't like this company anymore.  I despise the Burch siblings and what they did to this company, but I will elaborate in my Borderlands 2 review later down the line for anyone that actually cares.

This game is not bad.  I've heard stories about never getting good guns, but I got lucky and got them in the first 8 hours.  Yes...8 hours.(Still faster than Destiny or some others)  That's fine, because after those first 8 hours, I decided to team up in online play with some randoms.  I met a new friend who not only showed me the ropes but got me some good guns and a TON of money.  I had a blast even though the environments were somewhat bland and same-y or the enemies being mostly the same Bandits, Skags, and Rakk.  That's the where the real fun of Borderlands comes from, the co-op.  It was a smart idea and I felt like I was a rookie in a rag tag group of veteran bounty hunters.  That's something I've always wanted from a video game, but we're not in space technically yet cowboy.  ;)

I played as Mordecai, but there were times where I thought I should have picked a different class during my playthrough.  That quickly changed when I started leveling up and upgrading my bird and acid rounds.  It came to a point where I probably could have finished the game off myself, but I stuck with my group.  Story is forgettable and the humor is there.  Most of it didn't make me laugh, but it wasn't some dated meme or cry for attention like later games would unfortunately follow.  That's respectable in their own right.

In short if you really haven't played this game already, then playing it with some friends is definitely the way to go.  Despite lacking some options, PC is the way to go for this one.  I'm glad I gave it another shot and I'm glad the community was still around many years removed.  So to my group and the OG Borderlands players, you have my thanks."
5220,"Pros:
+fun bosses
+great co-op
+good soundtrack
+shit ton of side quests
Mehs:
+-story
Cons:
-gets repetitive quick
-VERY boring in singleplayer
overall a mediocre game, buy it on sale
(+10 hours on the 360)"
5221,"Very addictive game which will last you at least a solid 15 hours or even more if you decide to coop with friends or do every side quest. The random loot system will always surprise you in some way (Bandits/Mercs use the weapons they drop!). I found a revolver shotgun which made 80% of the game super easy but still super fun. The only thing which doesn't make this a ten is a crash bug and a fairly limited variety of enemies. It's addictive, the story is pretty good, the graphics are nice."
5222,10/10 (No refunds. Catch a ride. Don't forget to bring along some friends.)
5223,Yes
5224,"Amazing game, really fun to finish with some friends :)"
5225,"Ahh, Borderlands. A big old throwback to my childhood.

Nostalgia aside, this is a great PVE game for singleplayer, and ten times better with a group of friends.
Guns, guns, and more guns. So many combinations and so much loot to get, and so much to shoot. Storywise there isn't really much to offer. Get vault key, shoot bad guys in your way, get to vault. If you're gonna play for just the 'story' then you'll be pretty dissapointed. The gameplay is great, sweet and simple to the point of shoot yer' enemy. The guns are where things get really interesting, from all the elemental effects to x1, x2, x3, x4, the Damage over time, regular guns without elemental effects, and even weapon rarities. The better the rarity, the better the gun. (In well, most cases.) This goes for shields and gernade mods as well, even class mods. Building your character is great, and with the right character and right build. You could tank through the toughest of enemies.


Longstory short.
All four characters are unique and have their own abilities.
Grab unique gun types, shields, gernades, and class mods to your likng.
Shoot, just shoot.
A load of goddamn fun with your friends.
The humor and tone of this game is absolutely A+ (Looking at you Secret Armory DLC.)

This isn't storydriven like the second one. But this one, will always be my favorite.

You should totally buy this."
5226,L
5227,"For a 2009 game, the FPS and RPG is good for it's time and still is now, the game is a highly co-op but can be completed on your own, I would recommend playing with friends for a better expriance. There are thousands of guns to play with, so there's bound to be one to your liking and there's plenty of humor which makes the game even more entertaining!

The game is based on a planet called Pandora filled with crazy-ass killers which appear to be all human, there is a lot of different speices as well which try to kill you along the way. You have a choice of 4 character to play as which are all hunting for the same thing.... the vault, they're known as vault hunters, will YOU find the vault? Play the game and find out!

This game was very entertaining and i'm looking forward to playing Borderlands 2, a solid 8/10 rating from me

5229,"Good open-world game, but absolutely not as good as S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: SoC. And S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: CS is waaayy better. The only big positive thing in the game is that You can play it in co-op... if You have friends who like these kind of games. In single it could be better...

Pros:
- Many places to discover.
- So much enemy types.
- Leveling Your hero and unlocking cool skills
- Huge variety of weapons, shields, etc.
- Many bosses to kick in the ass.
- The story is interesting...

Cons:
- ...but don't expect it to be as good as the story of any of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games.
- Huge variety of weapons, shields, etc. Many-many-many hours wasted to find really good weapons.
- Some bosses are way too easy to kill while others are too hard. It's also true with regular enemies. Some You can kill with a punch while others You have to shoot 50% of Your smg bullets.
- In singleplayer it is way easier to play with some heros. The women is maybe the best. While the big guy (who looks like Hans Grösse from Wolfenstein by the way) is good against bosses and strong like hell, the soldier's auto turret is not a big deal (but can still be usefull in bossfights), but he can gets mods to regen. ammo which is cool (and really usefull if You have a really good weapon (and Your other wepons are bad)). And the sniper guy... Well... That bird is a crap. Especially in the begining of the game. After a few levels it's not that bad. They're all good in co-op (because they help each others skills), but in single it really matters who You playin'.
- There's not enough info about weapons. For etc. I found Assault rifles with good stats but there was no info about reload speed. Any yeah, my guy reloaded that weapon in 5-8 secs... It was not really good in huge battles...
- Level system is good, but far from being good enough.
- It's getting repetative after Level 20. There's really no huge suprises after that.
- Lots of bugs and when I wrote ""lots"" I ment ""loooooooooots"". You can find a bug nearly every 10 minutes which is a shame for a AAA game developed by a huge developer like Gearbox.

8/10"
5230,"Though graphically outdated, this is still a very fun game."
5231,"Don't get me wrong, it's not bad.  It might be I just got used to Borderlands 2 because I played it first, but in comparison, this game is way slower and more dull.  There isn't nearly as much dialogue for quests, if any, it's much slower paced, more gray and brown, and overall just not as good.  If you love the Borderlands games you might give it a shot, but overall I'd just start with 2; it's everything this game should've been (not to blame this game, they just learned a lot and really improved on it)"
5232,"It's obviously an incredible game.  I want to say though in the interest of informing others, this does not have a V-Sync graphics option.   In order to fix it, you have to dig into program files.  ""WillowEngine""  is what you're looking for, swtich the Vsync vaule to ""true""."
5233,"I thought the game was good

at first I had really bad screen tearing so I went onto borderlands wiki and luckily there was a fix for that problem (vsync cant be accessed in game but the file can be found and turned on)

the game ran well except for 2 dlc areas( the prison, and the first time in the city tarturus but after that first time it ran fine....I dont know what changed)

the story is kinda meh... it progresses the storyline

it has some good humor in the game and it really doesnt take itself seriously.

you will most like this game if you have a grinding type of gamestyle

oh one last thing is it would toggle off sprinting if you pressed either left or right for like 2 seconds or so, so you had to learn how to run straight and just move with your mouse"
5234,awesome game with ton of memories :)
5235,this is a supper fun game with friends.
5236,The tasks seemed a bit on the trivial side but other than that it seemed ok.  The artwork is unique and the story engaging enough that I would recommend it.
5237,"Look at me! I'm dancin'!

Shotguns can melt the bad guys. GIANT SPIDERS. I just ran over a midget!!!!! 

That's basic stuff tho. Just wait till you start getting skill points!"
5238,Game is awesome. Played two parts and want to buy the therd)))
5239,The humour put me off and the tasks were monotonous.
5240,Good game :)
5241,asa
5242,10/10
5243,Its Fun
5244,"Big, long and full of loot porn."
5245,"I'm not a fan of FPS games, but I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The RPG aspects of it and the humor make this an amazing game. And the sound and feel of each shot was just so satisfying. Better than any FPS I've played."
5246,This game is so good. Took over my life on xbox for so long.
5247,"Borderlands is an amazing FPS title, itll get you to chuckle every now and then and provides a solid story to be hooked on. Overall a great game!"
5248,"Guys, whats going on with steam? has anyone noticed that LITERALLY 99% of all indie games made by a single person or a small team, even if the game is not that deep, or its quite short, or if you just hold down the right key and do a few jumps ALL seem to be getting 9s out of 10 and perfect scores?? what the fuck. That means people are basically saying little easy to play games that are kinda fun like Starbound, simple little games, are JUST as good to someone who doesn't read reviews as like Zelda Breath of the Wild, even the same if not better than Final Fantasy 7, even better than mass Effect 2 and Dark souls.. they have higher ratings than these game... the hell is that about!?"
5249,"simple as that: one of the best Video Games ever made. (if you're into humor and shooters and fantasy)
Simple to play, local multiplayer, high replayability, long time fun, fair price, good DLC, great soundtrack

no more pro's needed."
5250,you will never grind so hard in your life
5251,10 out of 10 ... Best co op experience so far ... ^.^ really worth playin if r a science lover... Decent cartoony arts.. such an amazing story . :') really had a good time
5252,i h*ckin love this entire series. ive poured over a hundred hours into this game and i'm still not bored. even more fun with friends
5253,"The game is a 1-4 player CO-OP PvE game (for those powerfull heroes that want to test their strenth dont fear, there are arena's trough the place to test your skills against your friends/allies). The graphics and area style are typical Borderlands and you like it or hate it, The story is fun if you like to read the quest descriptions but before it becomes clear of what the REAL goal is of the story you are nearly at the end.


If you are still reading this, STOP READING AND START PLAYING ALREADY O_O !!!

This game has been my favourite since ive played it many years ago at my friends house."
5254,It has loot. I like loot.
5255,Finished the game in under 16 hours.
5256,"Its fun!
also BLOOD and EXPLOSIONS!
and unique&badass characters with different skills and Playstyles
also Co-op"
5257,"I only have 41 hours on pc for this game but i have much more on xbox i have played it multiple times including playthrough 2 with dlc, never get bored im always going to be playing this borderlands 2 wasnt as good but enjoyed doing the first playthrough. Download it for yourself and i hope you enjoy it as much as i do.
"
5258,"Borderlands is fantastic... 
Its cartoon-like visuals are ""a breath of fresh air"" from the realistic graphics that we are used to in most of the games. And that is the most original aspect of Borderlands! 

It has a nice sci-fi story with funny characters and funny moments. The humor is very peculiar, with a lot of violence, blood and madness in the mix.

The mechanics of the game are easy to adapt, the controls and options are almost the generics of any FPS. However, the system is more like what is common in RPG's, where enemies have a life bar that decreases as the damage is inflicted that is greater or less according to your stats.

Overall this is a awesome game with a lot to explore and do. Where you can easely spend a 20 hours plus to do the story. Its a must have to any Steam collector."
5259,Best Borderlands game!
5260,"i couldn't put myself to finish it, maybe it is meant to be played coop"
5261,Played on ps3 when i was youger. Great game! FOV is shit in y eyes tho
5262,"You can find $1,058 in a dumpster."
5263,"A true classic, with a great setting and characters.  Well worth picking up!"
5264,Fun FPS that I imagine is more fun online with a party. There's pretty much no story.
5265,b2w
5266,Gud succ but onlie mostlie
5267,"Money don't grow on tree!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



They grow in SKAGGGGGGG"
5268,better guns than borderlands 2 in the sense that they feel smooth and nice in borderlands 1 borderlands 2 makes they guns feel like a dog with no legs swimming
5269,i liked it
5270,"if someone came up to me on the street and asked me what i thought about this game, i would say ""THAT'S MY PURSE I DON'T KNOW YOU"""
5271,"I've played this game many times around console and PC, it's still one of my favourites of all time. It's just an easy game to get through if you're bored and if you want to do it again, you can! Two playthroughs, can get even higher levels and even four DLCs.

gg great game"
5272,"OK, this may just be the best game ever. Basically everything you see can be shot at or blown up. The few characters that aren't enemies won't die, but don't care either. And you get a dune buggy with a rocket launcher and UNLIMITED ammo. My favorite thing is to run over things, they make the nicest crunchy, squishy sound. Even after you finish each area, if you go back next time you play, all the enemies are there to kill again. You can try all the different weapons and build up your skills. Endless hours of fun and a great release after a hard day."
5273,So much better than 2
5274,"Before posting this i looked through the first page of negative reviews... i only saw around 5 or 6 people with more than 30 hours in the game... these happen to be the only ones i read because they actually put time into the game and explored it. Eveyone else had the same shit to say... I love borderlands... i played 2 TPS and just revisited this... i beat the campaign and i gotta say... the FOV did throw me off in the beginning i was slow like being overcombered in skyrim... but the more i played the more i saw the great in the game... this games loot makes sense ""what you see is what you get"" i got put into FFYL for the first time by level 13 by an smg that spit bullets and when i killed the bastard he dropped exactly that... i was so much more satisfyied to get guns the enemies used. Looting is so much more enjoyable in this game for whatever reason... people dont seem to give this game a chance. I believe i gave it a chance and it succeeded more than i could imagine... i now think that this game is better than borderlands 2 in some ways. If you read to here i urge you to play this game 1 play through and maybe youll enjoy it then. Sorry for errors if any... i wrote this on my phone at 2 am"
5275,I could not finsh this game due to a friend wanting me to play the sequal Borderlands 2.  However it is worth the buy if you are looking if just play something differnt and want to play a game that is some what fun.  The shooting and combat are good however playing the game for the first few mins can be hard cause you don't have a whole lot of health and such but I recommend this game anyway.
5276,"It's a solid start to a great series. Although it's not graphically impressive, it still has a unique look about it. Although the game was more built around the gun system than vice versa, it still feels great to play with easy to pick up controls. The difficulty curve is a little wonky where one boss will be stupid easy and the next, stupid hard, but thats my main gripe about the game. The level tree can be a bit daunting at first because ""Oh no what if I spec into the wrong thing and suck?"" but it works just fine for my friends and I, we only ever had one person have to reset during our playthrough. though it was because he was sick of the sniper playstyle he was building, not due to a flaw in the system. Class balancing could do with a little work, but I like the sort of built in difficulty system. Humor is pretty great and characters are very unique.

If you like FPS games, I'd say give it a try."
5277,"I remember buying this game right on release, still on disc at the time. I loved it right from the get go. Shooters became boring to me in general, but the story, additional elements, and sheer amount of different weapons, specializations, and character abilities made this so much fun.

This game, despite being ten years old nearly, has, in my opinion, aged well. The style of the game is still unique, and not may games (except its own sequels/prequels) have emulated it to date. As far as post-apocalyptic sci-fi shooters/action-RPGs go, and if you like these kind of games, then it's a MUST HAVE.

As of writing this review I am on my third or fourth play through, and I find I'm still discovering something new, and new nuances with it. If you do get it, get the GOTY edition. Even full price, for the amount of content and game time you get, it's still worth it. I'm not even going to mention performance. The game ran remarkably well on the contemporary rigs that were current at the time of release, anything that's still around now, should have no problems whatsoever to run this.

Go on! Catch a ride!"
5278,"Loot.

7/10"
5279,this is some cool shit
5280,the god damn fov make me puke over the screen
5281,"borderlands is sort of an fps version of diablo, set in a post-apocalyptic world of sorts. what i mean to say is that there's plenty of big maps (although not procedural), lots of nooks and crannies to explore, lots of enemies to kill, all the while, hoping to find some legendary loot.

there's a lot of fun to be had in borderlands, with the different characters, with different bonuses, and different play styles; it gives you quite a bit to experiment, and experience. on top of which, there's a fairly interesting story to go along with it, and lots of humorous moments/dialogue too.

despite being a fairly old game now, it still holds up rather well (in my opinion at least), and if you can grab some friends to tag along for the ride, it's all the better."
5282,"I wanted to like this game, I really did. After playing BL2 and the pre-sequel, those being one of my favorite games of all time, I wanted to experience ""the original"".

And oh boy, is this a boring game, so goddamn *BORING*.

+ The gun system is MUCH better, the number of different manufacturers + no limitations of what manufacturer can produce what (hyperion actually makes assault rifles in this!), and weapon level scaling, and usability is better. Why in the holy mother of god did they change this system in BL2?!
+ There is no slag, the purple kryptonite jizz of all that is fun in BL2.
+ Enemies actually use the weapons that they drop, which is both fun and scary when they are carrying something really good.

+/- There is item storage... but it's in a DLC. 
+/- Enemy variety is low. Like, 95% of the time, I am either fighting the same bandits, skag gogs or those spider crabs with the occasional cliff racer. 

- The environments are incredibly dull, boring, featureless, painted with pallets of brown and grey. 
- There is very little voice acting, cutscenes or... anything really.
- There is no antagonist or ""enemies"". The bandits are there more or less just living, and you just show up to f|_|ck their sh|_|t up. And while that wouldn't be a problem, if there was a compelling story, but there isn't. There is just so little motivation to push through the near non-existing story of a ""treasure hunt"".
- There is very little humor, dark or otherwise. Apart from the occasional psycho ramblings, I can't think of anything that was funny.
- If an enemy is 4 or more levels above you (which is really easy to run into especially in early levels) the game slaps a MASSIVE damage reduction AND damage boost on them, making them nigh on impossible to survive against let alone kill.
- I don't know why, but the guns overall feel way less accurate than in BL2 or the Pre-sequel, though this is not an issue if you like to engage in close-to-medium distane only.
- There is fall dame. Though it is minimal, but it is clear that this game was not designed with same kind of wide-n-high environments in mind as BL2/pre-sequel.
- Driving over enemies in a car, instantly kills them all. Driving over enemy 4 levels higher than you, instantly kills you.
- Driving mechanics are just crap. You cannot steer and aim at the same time. Your goddamn mouse controls the left and right turn AND the turret at the same time. Who thought this was a good idea!?
- Side quests are incredibly dull and offer no worthwhile rewards. Atleast in BL2 you got unique weapons all the time AND some voice acted story. In this, there is a small text box, some little cash and a litle xp.
- You can't swich items between your characters, at all, unless you get someone to help you in the process through multiplayer.
- Quest markers. In BL2, the map shows when there is available quest, what teleport location is closest to your quest etc. In BL1 they are a bit lacking.
- Spawn timers. Enemies spawn really fast. Like, in 10 minutes, every enemy and the map boss will re-spawn, even if you are still in the area, so, better hurry up.

Overall, BL1 is not a BAD game. Mechanically it is very solid, but compared to BL2 and the pre-sequel, it feels like a tech-demo, and what I mean by this is that it's boring. If you are not bothered by lack of story, humor or lack of environmental design, you should try this for the gunz, otherwise pick up BL2, it's just better... and not boring."
5283,Still worth it in 2017. True classic.
5284,"One of the best multiplayer shooters I've played.

Entertaining story and characters in a semi-open world game. Linear storyline but with plenty of side missions to keep you occupied. Easily 20 hours of play time.

The sequel Borderlands 2 is even better. I would recommend play this first as both are incredible games, but moving from Borderlands 2 to Borderlands makes the controls feel a little clunky."
5285,"It's cool for what it is. I prefer PSQ, but this manages to intrigue me more than the second game did.

Overall a very firm recommendation from me."
5286,"This is a classic and will always remain as such. If you have not played this you should it often comes up on sale so smash it into your wish list and get it then.

Hours of fun and it never gets dull as a solo play game"
5287,Pretty good
5288,"I have a lot of reverence for Borderlands for what it did for the FPS genre, but oh boy has this game not aged well.

The game is incredibly grindy and full of fetch quests that are about as interesting as your entry-level WoW missions. Travel is slow and cumbersome and monsters are constantly respawning, slowing you down and artificially adding time to the game. Shooting is often VERY finnicky, often leading to bullets disappearing or never meeting their mark. Character progression in terms of weapon upgrades is frustratingly slow, causing the player to rely on being overleveled in order to increase their damage. Boss designs are pretty uninspired, and seem to just equate to: boss == more health and more damage. Enemy diversity in general is pretty poor, killing the same enemies over and over and over is so incredibly boring. A lot of quality of life things are missing like: good sorting, multiple quest tracking, easier vending, easier equipping, etc.

The game isn't all bad. I like the insertion of RPG elements into a shooter and Borderlands does that FAIRLY well. The art style is gorgeous and the game knows its aesthetic and plays to its strengths. The characters have some amount of charm but VERY little voicing. 

Overall, the game feels like a big grindfest in a very bleak world. Obviously Borderlands is a product of its time, but it's pretty important to recognize its shortcomings as well as its contributions."
5289,Love it. Recommend it.
5290,"my long awaited review for Borderlands is here. After spending countless hours meticulously shooting angry birds in this game I have to say: This game is on par with angry birds. While I gave angry birds my personal goty award for 2009, 2010, 2011, (2nd place in 2012 cuz of weak shooting mechanics lets be real) 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, I gotta give it to borderlands for really mixing the angry b irds formula up. If I had to pick out my favorite thing about this game it would be that it is very good and that I like it. 

I am still waiting for the Borderband: Rise of the Mexican Mariachi Ensemble Expansion Pack, but until then I will have to settle with this bideo game. 

I would have given this game 5000 mega points out of 5001 rick and mortys but it is an obvious overwatch rip-off so I have to say: Shame on the developers for pursuing a scam like this.

As always, thanks for watching and remember to stay [b][u]hard[/u][/b]
"
5291,"so... I don't know where to start. If your first borderlands experience was the second game, borderlands 1 will maybe disappoint you. The game doesn't have chapters and story missions feel like side quests so i do recommend reading the ""breafing"" in your ECHO menu... Now, i didn't finish the story yet but i did get far enough to explain how it feels like... My friends told me the boss fights are really good and so far i can say it myself too... The game is a real challange so it's good to farm a good gear to defeat badass enemies... Now, the game has a lot of glitchy ways to beat the bosses for exemple i was fighting a boss on a turret and a glitched him so he can't shoot me even tho i didn't want to. Let's move on to game's design. Graphics can be inproved a lot from what you get first time entering borderlands, you can turn on the shadows, improve textures... I do belive you could find some mods so the game would look like the second borderlands.

Bad things about this game aren't bad in a way that is game breaking is just more challangeing, so for some hardcore gamers this is the game for them... So, if the enemies kill you, you will enter 'fight for your life' mode which in second borderlands wasn't a big deal because you could move, well in this one things are a bit diffrent and then the next thing is the map which is known to be in skyrim and in some other games but luckly you can access the map by pressing 'M'.... At the start of the game you will probably be not used to the field of view that the game has and you cant change it.... There are some more things that you will descover but i just counted the things that step out the most... I will rate it 8/10... So make sure to buy it if you want to see borderlends 2 characters backstory for exemple how tannis got on pandora and her first few days... I don't want to spoil it too much so you will see it for yourself...
                                                                                                                                                                Thank you for taking your time and reading this :)"

5293,This is a great game.
5294,"Good game, strange and unsatisfying ending."
5295,"I could go on and on about how this game changed my life, how much time I put into the retail version before its migration to steam, how many times I played LAN with my friends using the same install disc via a semi-legal patched .exe, and how the DLC all together makes for a fulfilling game in and of itself, and two of which are a direct extension of the already interesting plot. But I'll save the essay, to keep this review clean. Buy this, buy it and install it at your first convinience. I have never played something quite like it and the sequels, in my humble opinion, don't capture its magic."
5296,Great game!
5297,Would recommend.
5298,"[h1]Borderlands - A four Player coop Quest based FPS[/h1]

After a complete playthrough I can give a detailed review of this game.

[b]PROS[/b]

-It's much fun with friends
-The music is awesome
-It has good DLC (except for one which I will mention at the ending)
-The game is pretty cheap for the existing content (GOTY)

-There are way to many bugs (especially when driving)
-The Story is hard to understand for new players

[b]Recommendation[/b]
Buy this game, if you have at least one friend to play with."
5299,"The game is quite nice. Although I find it in comparisson to borderlands 2 a bit bold. 
Don't get me wrong, when this game was released it was a great game. But it misses some story line, and some dynamic borderlands 2 did have. With less dynamic than borderlands 2 this game just progresses too slow to be called a great game. Its is okay, but that is about it. 

Would recommend, got the game with an easy pick during humble bundle for just a few bucks. But borderlands 2 is better"
5300,"I've played the console version for well over 500 hours. I've beat the game quite a few times in the process of having fun modding the game, and getting the DLC's. I never was able to get all the DLC's for the console version, sadly. In those 500 hours I have discovered that the borderlands franchise is my favourite franchise. It never seems to get me bored, and I am always ending up playing it all over at some point. I lost the console version, and was really hyped that I got the GOTY Edition with all the DLC's on PC. I have already modded the PC version, and am planning to finish the entire DLC games without the mods. Overall I never get bored of this game, and it's such an amazing game. I reccomend to everyone, and don't listen to the people that say, ""Oh this gets so boring over a period of time."" I can tell you from my experience with the 500 hours on PS3 IT DOESN'T! I'm sure for you it will get boring at some point, but not for me! I say 10/10 best game I have ever played, and probably will be the best for a while. Again, this is only an opinion."
5301,Love this game but it should be 10 dollars not 20 bucks.
5302,"You were playing another shooter, but then you picked up Borderlands and are left horrifed at how much time you've lost on an inferior product when you could have been on Pandora."
5303,kek
5304,"Great game!  Where it all started!  I think BL2 is a little better, but I still think this game is a blast to play!  I would certainly recommend it... espeicially to play with friends!  And if you like it, you MUST get BL2.  =)"
5305,Great game
5306,A classic FPS that feels like an MMO as well.  Extremely fun and lots to do.
5307,"I really regret buying all the Borderlands games except from the telltale one, which was really good. The other ones were way too repetitive for me, I was just killing people and looting for 29 hours.

COME AT ME BRO

EDIT: I actually changed my mind, now that I started it from the beginning and finished it properly. You should definitely buy this and you will have much fun playing this. I haven't tried playing co-op, but I imagine it will be just as fun as single player, or even more



P.S. CATCH A RIIIIIDE!!!!"
5308,"It is a beautiful fucking game with amazing story, gameplay, atmosphere and quality. There is some bad issues with the mechanic/gamephysics, but the game is still lovable like a beauty russian blonde who got eyes like the clear blue sky. Awesome game!"
5309,my grandpa will be proud
5310,10/10
5311,really good game highly recomend
5312,"Borderlands is a brilliant mix of RPG and FPS however, it's not an open world RPG like Fallout or Skyrim, you have to unlock areas by completeing missions etc.  The game has lots of fun missions and the story is amazing. There are also loads of weapons, some have special features like flame which really makes the combat interesting. The graphics are really nice although the it's not optimized very well, I often get FPS drops during non stressful situations but all in all, it's a really fun game, especially with friends."
5313,Played in on console will play it again
5314,Great Game!
5315,"At first I hated the borderlands games, but a friend of mine pushed me to play it, so i did now its one of my favorite franchises."
5316,Makes my cock hard
5317,borderlands fan
5318,"[b]After playing this for a while and ending it several times (On Xbox and PC), I have concluded:[/b]

[b]PROS:[/b]
Very fun game.
Has decent comical graphics (cell-shaded).
Epic DLCs.
If you have a friend to play with the fun is 10x more.
100% worth the value.
Great humour as well as plot twists.
Unlimited(almost) amount of guns.
Replayability.

[b]CONS:[/b]
It could have better grinding capabilities.
You need to walk around a lot for missions.
Weird driving mechanics.
It could have more/better villains.

PS. If the game is on sale and you don't get the GOTY edition, it's basically a sin."
5319,"Just buy it, you will thank me later

great story and missions, great dlc, solid fps elements.

The cell shading is why I think most people will not get this game, but you will get used to it."
5320,"don't buy this if youre hoping for split screen with a friend, or if youre into games that work properly with controller. buy this game if you really hate having fun and enjoy stressing yourself out trying to get a game to work"
5321,LOVE this game and this francise. It is at its best when playing with friends. solo is doable and can be fun but the joy of killing things and exploring and fighting over gear is to much fun with friends.
5322,I originally purchased this game for a console and completed it there. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased it here on Steam so that I could obtain the additional DLC. I can't get enough of it!
5323,"Great story, and gameplay mechanics, with a fun comic book styled art. Its even better with a full party of 4 but still a fun single player playthrough neverthless."
5324,THIS GAME IS EPIC EVEN FOR 2017!!!!
5325,"This is the best game in the store, I really enjoyed it!"
5326,10/10 can play for days on end
5327,I love this game :D
5328,"Borderlands is an action, role-play first person shooter with a very high regard for loot, often reffered to as a ""shoot and loot"" game. Developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K games, Borderlands was originally released October 29, 2009. It was, and as a series still is, geared toward online multiplayer for 2-4 players, but is still fun for solo play. Unfortunately the first game in the series is only playable as a single player game now, the servers that the game used for multiplayer have been shut down.

The basic plot of the game is you are one of four selectable vault hunters on a mission to locate and open a vault that is promised to have untold riches inside. The mission takes place on an alien planet called Pandora, and it is full of all kinds of creatures and bandits that you can unload millions of rounds into. As briefly noted above there are four different vault hunters you get to choose from, each with his/her own special abilities and weapon preferences. As you level up your character you can spend points on a skill tree to improve your character in various ways. 

-First is Roland the soldier. His weapon preferences are rifles and shotguns, though he is proficient in all weaponry. His action skill deploys a Scorpio Turret that tracks and fires on all enemy targets within range. It also deploys an energy barrier you can take cover behind. Upgrading the Scorpio Turret provides offensive or defensive improvements, such as healing any players nearby. 

-Second is Lilith the Siren. She is one of six women in existance born with mystical powers, recognized by various tattoos on their body. Lilith favors weapons with elemental properties (fire, acid, electrical and explosive). Her action skill uses her Siren powers to ""Phasewalk,"" an ability that allows her to temporarily enter another dimension, turning her invisible to enemies and invulnerable to attack. It also increases her speed and phasing in and out creates a shockwave that damages nearby enemies. 

-Next is Mordecai the Hunter. This is the character I used for my first play through of the game. I think I chose him ‘cause he reminds me of Roland Deschain in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. His weapons of choice are sniper rifles to dispatch his enemies from afar, and revolvers for up close combat. Mordecai's action skill is his pet falcon Bloodwing, which can be dispatched to attack his enemies from a distance, and after upgrading, she can attack multiple enemies and cause them to drop larger amounts of items. 

-And last but not least is Brick the Berzerker, the largest of the four original vault hunters. He is a tank-style character with very strong melee attacks. Brick prefers explosive weapons and rocket launchers. His action skill is the ability to go ""Berzerk."" He loses the ability to fire any weapons, but his melee power vastly increases as he uses both fists to punch his enemies to death. During this time he also rapidly regenerates health. 

 Unfortunately there really isn't much to the story itself, at least if there is it didn't leave a big impression. Even so I really enjoy playing the game and plan on playing through it again in the near future. After doing countless quests for the people of Pandora, the vault hunters finally get the key to the vault, find it and open it. What is in the vault? Unbridled wealth? Riches beyond measure? Nope. Instead it is home to a giant alien monster that the vault hunters have to fight to the death. It was a fairly cool creature and a tough battle, satisfying overall. 

There were four downloadable add-ons called: 

-""The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned"" which is pretty self-explanatory. 

-""Madd Moxxi's Underdome Riot"" which is an arena. 

-""The Secret Armory of General Knox"" which introduces Athena who becomes a playable character in the newest game in the series.

-""Claptraps New Robot Revolution"" also self-explanatory. 

I have all the add-ons but haven’t played through them all the way. The gameplay and control is very comfortable and familiar to those with first person shooter experience. The graphics are cell shaded and pretty. The sound and voice acting is great with many funny moments, and some annoying moments with the little robot known as clap trap that is your guide during certain moments throughout the game. 

 Overall Borderlands is a great game that is a lot of fun to play and has a high replay value. 
 I rate it a 7/10."
5329,is good
5330,"This game is still fun, people still play multiplayer from time to time. I like to setup a game so people can join randomly.
Even if the game is dated it still holds plenty of action. On sales you can get all the DLC for less than $5 invluding the base game."
5331,"The gameplay is good if you like fps games and loot based grinding. The storyline and dialouge are basically non existant in anything other than text. And the ending is kinda lame.

As for the pc port, it's kinda terrible. It's not buggy, it's just missing features that most pc games have. but most of the issues are fixable through the config files.

So heres a list of everything that the pc version does poorly.

-Lack of FOV slider in the options menu leaving the game locked at 70 by default (semi-fixable through config files).
-Framerate is locked at 62 max with no option to change it in the main menu (fixable through config files).
-Mouse acceleration and smoothing are turned on but there are no options to turn it off in the menu (fixable through config files)
-No HUD safezone options for people who may want the interface closer to the center.
-Reload is also bound to the ""use"" key for some reason as well as having its own seperate button causing accidental realoads when you want to interact with something during a firefight.
-No seperate keybinds for vehicles so if you wanted to map the ""boost"" button to your sprint button you are out of luck (as far as i can tell)

I only recommend this game for people who don't mind the mentioned issues, who are fans of the series, who don't mind digging through config files, and for people who like the loot based fps genre a ton. but by now there are probably like 20 other similar games that do a better job including the much better sequels to this game.

Summary: the game is pretty decent but the PC port is terrible."
5332,The only border I am on is the border of killing myself
5333,Not that I'm a 2k fan boy or anything but I got this game on release a long time ago on my console. And I still play it. So well worth a buy
5334,"Never used to like this game, but trying it now on PC has been a much better experience.

A game best played with friends, and kind of feels like a Destiny type game before it existed.

I don't remember much like this at the time, but this game holds up really well in all departmants.

Kind of short, but there's DLC and plenty more games in the series to get my hands on at this point."
5335,"very very very fun game
"
5336,"I think this game is a 'light' version of the game Fallout.


10/10"
5337,"If you can deal with how slow the game can be, I 
absolutely recommend it."
5338,"After years i finally finished the first Borderlands which i tried back in my childhood on a LAN :D
Cartoonish FPS with roleplaying elements like leveling and looting.
Quite big world, many sidequest and an insane and sick humour :D
But the second one is waaay better! Still a good game.
8/10"
5339,"It looks nice, it plays nice. But it's really a rather boring game. It feels like I'm playing an empty MMO - it was clearly meant to be played co op first and foremost. A touch repetitive and the enemy AI isn't great - the respawn rate is far too fast - as such there's not much immersion. I'm well aware I'm playing a video game rather than being sucked into a world. It's a shame as the world is very nice - good atmosphere, slick engine and great music. I'm well aware I'm in the minority here. It's still a recommendation if you want something lightweight and fun to pass the time."
5340,Great shit with friends
5341,"I dont know why people dont like this game, we are in 2017 i played the BL2 for 160 hours and this only on 14 hours im enjoying Bl1 more than the 2. in other words i prefere BL1 than the 2 :D



69/10"
5342,"the game is fking great! i love the roleplaying posibilities and i also like that is less cartoony than the sequel ! the story is great, despite the fact that there is not much voice acting, but how lazy can you be to not read a couple of lines?!.. 
overall i'd give it a 8/10. 
it has it's bugs and the cities feel lifeless :/ and the interaction with the villagers is bad.. but i'm glad they fixed that in the second one! GJ Gearbox! 

i can't wait for the third one! at least... i hope there will be another sequel or, maybe, even a prequel would be interesting"
5343,"Borderlands is an amazing game, possibly one of my favourite games. 

Good: Great gameplay, enjoyable characters, fun weapons, and just charming good looking graphics. 

Bad: Some camera controls can be a bit awkward, finding an unnecessarily powerful weapon early on in the game makes it unbelievably easy. 

10/10

""That was me, high fiving myself."" - Jack"
5344,"Apparently 77.2% of everyone who has the game hasn't even beaten it



great game"
5345,"This game is super cool.
Art style is rad.
"
5346,"Not much story, introduces the cool borderlands gameplay mechanics but that's really it. Maybe fun with a few friends but I found there were too many fetch quests and could never bring myself to finish it. Borderlands 2 however is much much more fun, get that one instead unless you're into nostalgia or just want to see the beginnings of the whole borderlands story line."
5347,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
5348,Ain't no rest for the wicked.
5349,"did i have fun? a little.
was it memorable? not really.
my recommendation: buy it on sale."
5350,"Even though its the 1st game of the sequel of borderlands, it's very good. It has a higher difficult when playing solo compared to the 2nd game and it makes the game pretty good to play.
"
5351,"The missions are boring and repetitive, ranging from ""go here collect this"" and ""go here and kill him"", this even applies to the story missions.

Go play Borderlands 2, a much better game"
5352,Awesome! Totally addictive.
5353,I am in lesbians with this game.
5354,"Classic game, fun quips from many characters, and terrific cell shading. Love it!"
5355,Much good.  If yo plaay this her gayme yoo will have fnally lifed.
5356,"Just finished the game. Loved it all the way through.
I played the heck out of BL2 and a bit of Pre Sequel before giving this game a shot, and if you've done the same as I did, you will notice the game is a bit more rough around the edges than its later sequels.

Borderlands has it flaws, like the horrible FOV and the iffy console porting to PC, but in my opinion the game still makes it  in my top 10 favorite games list.

The gameplay is pretty smooth and the inventory system is rather good. All the gameplay elements for a fun time are there. The difficulty isn't all that high on the default setting though.
The maps are okay. Lots of props are reused throughout the game. The setting itself is good.
The weapons feel powerful, and well, there are a lot to choose from.

The enemy diversity was better in Borderlands 2, but it gets the job done.

The characters are great fun, especially Brick. What is more fun than punching bad guys in the face?
The skill system is fun to use and you can feel your character becoming stronger and stronger.

A tip for people who are tempting to give this game here's a golden tip:
When you're starting out, immediately start to save up money. When you're around level 15 invest all that cash in a good Class Mod. Even if you have to sell almost your whole inventory to be able to buy it, do it! It is well worth the money and makes the game a lot more enjoyable.

Rating: 85/100

5357,I played this on xbox 360 when it originally came out over 48 hours. thats not including the DLC. now 6 years later ive moved to PC and bought it including all DLC!  I waited 6 GOD DAMN YEARS TO KILL THE EVIL DR ZED AND MAN WAS IT WORTH IT!!!

5361,"amazing game, highly reccommend to play it with friends"
5362,"The beginning to a great series. Super cool story, fun gameplay, and replayability like you wouldn't believe!"
5363,"Alright, my review for Borderlands 1 after owning it forever.

This game is one of the best FPS-RPG[ish] games I've ever played. I have been a life-long fan of the entire series.

Although I would recommend this game to anyone interested for the story + decent gameplay, it has some quirks that weren't changed until BL2 came out.

Pros:
+ Good story
+ Good sounds
+ Good classes / skills
+ Mad Moxxi

Cons:
- Driving (especially running over enemies) feels weird"
5364,baf game
5365,Borderlands was a great development change. From realistic graphics to cartoon graphics changes the types of game and makes it intruiging. It does not remove any of the fun from the game. Playing over the network in teams makes this a great game to play with your friends and extremley challenging.
5366,Still holds up as one of the best RPG shooters out there. 9/10
5367,...
5368,"Still tons of fun after all this time. You should certainly get the GOTY edition for all of the DLC, it's worth the price."
5369,"[h1]This game is good but you better play the prequel or part II[/h1] 

One of the best co-op shooters of last decade. However, this is 2017 and you can avoid this and straight go to sequel of this one."
5370,Its old tho
5371,"It is such an amazing game! Not only is the gameplay entertaining, but also the characters that are playable. Favorite character of all time is Brick The Berserker."
5372,"+++: Unique Gameplay.The characters are funny and creatives.The world of Pandora is unique and mysterious and it has a lot of charisma.A lot of unique guns and equipement.The classes are very unique and you are free to build your character whatever you want.The soundtrack is good and etablish the overall mood of Pandora.The game is full of side quests and the main quest lenght is reasonable.When you beat the game you can redo the game but with higher level enemies.The DLC's are really good and worth cheking out.

---:Only 4 classes.The story is a little bit weak in this game

9/10 Really good game,one my favorite game of all time and started this legendary franchise"
5373,One of my favorite games of all time.
5374,"No splitscreen multiplayer on a nearly ten year old game is absolutely unsatisfactory, Steam prevents any other work around. while the consoles can easily support splitscreen, my vastly superior PC is incapible of such a task."
5375,"This is a great game. The main story is good, but all of the side quests complete the package."
5376,fun with friends.
5377,"I LOVE This Game. I used to play it on PS, but bought the Bundle for my PC on steam summer sale. I havn't regretted it once! Love the graphics, love the gameplay, love the exelent humor. Looking forward to playing and replaying alle the Borderlands games a thousand times. PS. Lilith Rules.."
5378,"Massive world and weapons for days
Mad Moxxi is a babe
Fun quests and lots of replay
Corrosive weapons: those screams moisen my cave"
5379,Most realistic game i have played to date. the graphics are to die for
5380,"Borderlands is a mix of gory fps with a joke vibe about it, the cell shading was amazing for it's time and the game is a classic masterpiece!"
5381,"The prequel to Borderlands 2, it holds up well for it's time.

5383,Great game
5384,"Borderlands is the best shooter game franchise I have ever played. 
The game is full of content. Have great DLCs, a really good sense of humor and a really enjoyable story.
I recommend all of them."
5385,I'm writing a Borderlands review in 2017.
5386,"love love love this game, keeps me and my boyfriend entertained for hours. It is one of them games that you can play all day and not get tiered of it. If you are looking for a good game to play alone or with a friend that is funny and full of action Borderlands is your game."
5387,"Very good game, alot of content. Got the DLC's and they are really good. All that at a very good price."
5388,Amazing shoot and loot game. I played this game alot on Xbox 360 and picked it up on Steam. I got about 13 hours on pc and I am very inpressed on how it runs on pc. I highly reccomend this game. Very fun to play with friends.
5389,This is the first game I've played with one of my frend and I really enjoyed it. It's an old but good game.
5390,ayy
5391,wait what game is this
5392,This game really really hates me.
5393,"very good, I like"
5394,Buy it and CATCH A RIIDDEEE!
5395,this game is interesting
5396,i got my butthole eattin out by a skag
5397,"Pretty much every person who has something bad to say about this game is some arrogant Borderlands 2 fanboy who thinks that game is superior because it has shiny graphics. Borderlands 1 is a masterpiece and people shouldn't discourage other from buying the game just because they prefer another game in the series. Every Borderlands game is great and worth checking out, but I personally feel that Borderlands 1 is the best of them all if people are willing to look past how dated it looks. I got this game on Xbox 360 back when it released and logged thousands of hours because every playthrough of this game feels unique due to the randomized looter-shooter aspect, so it actually looked WORSE than the Steam version! Buying Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel, while these are excellent games on their own, will not give you the original experience, so just try it out and see if it's to your liking."
5398,"Very good coop game. PSA for ppl playing in 2017 & beyond:

Remove fps limit:
C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\TslGame\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\GameUserSettings.ini
MaxSmoothedFrameRate=240 (change number to your monitor refresh rate)

Search google for 'Borderlands Configuration Editor' to change FOV and other Quality of Life stuff."
5399,Fun AF
5400,"I love playing this game with my hubby and godmode enabled!

11/10"
5401,"Borderlands 2 was amazing.
This is the exact opposite to borderlands 2
1. Slow Paced ( Really slow game and super unfun.)
2. FOV Made my head hurt like hell ( cant change it either)
3. the voice acting made me cringe.
4. Graphics are the best part about this game, the graphics are awesome :)

Would not reccomend
Just get Borderlands 2 and The presequel
this isnt worth the buy :)"
5402,one of the greatest games ever created don't be fooled by my small amount of playtime i have hundreds of hours invested in this game on the console you need this game
5403,Fuck around and shoot things
5404,"I had originally played this game solo, and that was a mistake. This game is best played with friends. The writing is hilarous, with memoriable characters, and a well fleshed out world. Sometimes the audio-logs can get lost in all the gunfire, but the humor is well done. The graphics are solid, with a lovely cell-shaded effect, and a very Mad Max feel. The gunplay is tight, fast, and has all the addiction of Diablo's ""just one more run"" feeling."
5405,"I bought this game during a steam sale. I had played this game several years ago and then i tought it was funny and action packed. The main game is just that a rollercoaster of mayhem and loot. Altough it's recommended to play with several players in coop it is not a problem to venture alone. Even in 2017 there were people online for coop missions. I would opt for the pack of everything even when the zombie addon is tedious. Moxxie is hilarious and Knoxx is a general who should have given up his job long ago.
8/10 main game
addons 5-8/10 depending on which"
5406,I have to kill myself to progress the story? Literally unplayable!
5407,"Appalling graphics and absolutely boring gameplay. I tried to force myself to like this shite for three games straight...I'm done lying to myself. Normally, I wouldn't complain too much about a game's graphics as long as the game overall is good. But, no. This is shit. I'd rather play Halloween on atari, I'd rather go to a ""Discount, dyi vasectomy"" clinic, I'd rather shit a cactus out my dick. The boring ass gameplay and lack of a storyline fail to redeem this pile of donkey shit. The graphics though, oh man, they top it off. Like a hemorrhoid on a sundae of day-after-bbq shit. Fucking disgusting. Buy it on sale, if you don't believe me. For 2009 the shitty graphics are inexcusable. ""B-but it's meant to be cartoony!""
NO! It's shit, and you are deluding yourself if you think otherwise. It's like they designed every frame in MS paint. And if that's the case, they did good, but I can't be the only one disgusted by seeing giant-ass PIXELS MAKING JAGGED, FUK-HUEG LINES EVERYWHERE. Not to mention the lack of the option for adjusting the graphics settings, much less the shite resolution. F**kbois fire away. :^)"
5408,probably good
5409,Wut is dat my man? I will tell You. It's a sh!ty game
5410,This game is gud.
5411,as good as sex
5412,I love this game it is so good
5413,"This game is so good. So good.
I remember playing it when it first came out. Then I kinda forgot about it and years later I got hooked on Borderlands 2.
Part of the reason I didn't go back to Borderlands 1 was the lack of Linux support. But now it works just fine with Wine.
Borderlands 1 is in my honest opinion the most balanced game of the series when it comes to guns and gear.
You have a lot of guns to choose from that are actually good. And the legendary drop rates are very good.
The graphics are actually a lot better than I remember. Just remember to turn all the graphics effect to max.
Also I highly recommend editing the WillowInput.ini to bind both sprint and the FOV setting to the sprint button since the game doesn't have an FOV slider.
Buy the game. Play the game. Set graphics to max. Fix the FOV. Enjoy!"
5414,"8/10

A large, fun experience that has plenty of content for people who want to play alone, or with friends. Adding on some decent DLC packs also really increases the fun and replay value. If you're good with loot-driven gameplay with minimal story, then this will be a blast for you.

"
5415,"-play on easy difficulty
-get killed by boss npcs everytime
-google glitches to kill them
-die every time because it takes 10 bullets to kill a normal guy but 10000 to kill a guy a little bit taller than him
ign 10/10 would be killed countlesly because im asocial again"
5416,"Amazing game
"
5417,"I started this game and first thing, I get a mouse spin-out. I've played other games where I have not gotten this just to test if it was the mouse. However, I believe strongly that it is the game. Steam, may you please fix this or at least tell me how I can?"
5418,"The fuck you readin' comments for? You get to kill midgets that are on fire who curse you out and you befriend a dumb as rocks southern car dealer. After that you kill a giant octopus cause it has some cool guns. Buy this game, play it with some friends."
5419,must have for people who like looter shooters. Still Good Thumbs up
5420,very fun as well even better with friends.
5421,what isn't there to like looting and shooting and more loot
5422,"10/10, would leave anime expo to play again."
5423,Very classic game. It still holds up and it's very fun and rewarding. It's worth your money.
5424,Classic. Always fun. Never a dull moment. Don't make them like this anymore. Content for days ... months ... Steam sale $5 ... crazy amazing.
5425,good recoommend
5426,"This is definitely a couch game as you need to be far away from your monitor otherwise you'll get sick due to the low FOV (70) I suggest playing with a controller on your couch or grabbing the game on PS3 or Xbox 360. As for the game.... It's alright for multiplayer, but the lacking story and repetitive back and forth questing is really boring especially when you run so slowly. Feel free to just start on Borderlands 2."
5427,"Is good, Yeah?"
5428,Love this game
5429,Fun game
5430,"This seemed like such a cool idea. The 'cartoon-like' textures was a terrific idea and looks great. The open world feel to it is promising and the difficulty of the enemies makes it worth exploring and leveling your character up.

However, there are no AI companions so if you don't know anyone that plays this then you are all on your own. The game world is bland and has little going on in it so you constantly feel alone which gets boring rather quickly. There really isn't much else to do aside from explore here, grind as you kill enemies and slowly level up and then you unlock some more missions to do, repeat.

After a while I just got bored of it so I eventually had to put it to bed."
5431,this is a great game. The only thing i have a problem with is that it glitches sometimes
5432,"Absolutely love this game:

Pros:
Great weapons
Large map
Fun vehicles
Character customization
Multiplater

Cons:
The storyline at the end, though my frustrations are more directed towards Borderlands 2, if you play this game and this game alone it won't be too bad. (Excluding the prequel since I haven't played that one)"
5433,"Shooty, Looty, get that Booty"
5434,Great game if you like to shoot up stuff!
5435,"Intro Trailer 10/10


Game 7/10"
5436,Great game. A must have.
5437,"Good multiplayer game, if you expected split screen like on every console version than you'll be sorely dissapointed. Thumbs down until split screen is added to this version."
5438,pretty litty
5439,I played this on ps3 7 years ago this summer and it is still one of my favorite games ever.
5440,Good- justt wanted stickers :)
5441,"This is a classic and will always remain as such. If you have not played this you should it often comes up on sale so smash it into your wish list and get it then.

Hours of fun and it never gets dull as a solo play game"
5442,"If you haven't entered the Borderlands, you're missing out on one of the most influential games of our generation that is easily one of the top games of all-time. From the game's fantastic storyline to its addictive shooting and looting mechanic, you won't be able to get enough of Borderlands once you boot up the game. Picking up Borderlands is well worth your money and unlike other titles, Borderlands's DLCs are must owns that vastly improve the game's original storyline and deliver high quality content that must be experienced before moving on the Borderlands 2."
5443,"One of my favourite games of all time! The base game, DLC 1, 3, and 4 are top quality and definitely worth playing through. I'd give DLC 2 a pass, especially if you're playing solo like I did. Might be worth something to you if you plan on playing with friends though. I didn't really like the repetitiveness of DLC 2, but if that's your thing then knock yourself out.

There are a few ludicrous collection missions in each of the DLCs, however you can avoid them if you have no desire to 100% the game. The only achievement that can really be troublesome is ""And they'll tell two friends"". Hit me up and if I've still got the game installed I'll help. Otherwise just make a post on the discussions and somebody will likely save the day.

Took me about 80 hours to complete all achievements. If anybody's interested..."
5444,"Very fun game, hud is really bad"
5445,Almost s fun as borderlands 2 but the fov is terrible other than that almost all positve
5446,Borderlands is such a fun game. Especially with friends!
5447,"THAT GAME IS SO FREAKING NICE
"
5448,"Well, you win some, you lose some. Never played this so I tried it. Win 7 GTX 750 16gb ram 8370 AMD 8 core runs fine except....no sound when gameplay starts. The intro was cool the music played, the people spoke, but playing the game sucked. Reminded me of a low res version of a game I am alpha testing now."
5449,"Borderlands is not very good. It's a competent shooter with a ""And then this"" narrative, which leads to a pretty profound apathy while playing. Borderlands is the salad of videogames: it will fill your time but it's mostly just crunchy emptiness. You walk away unfulfilled.

I did not have fun. I was entertained for in spurts, but nowhere near the ""30 seconds of fun"" loop I get out of Halo games, and a good many shooters, from this period.

To short circuit ""but why'd you play X hours"" considerations: I did it as part of a podcast project, and because I agreed to do it. Otherwise I would not have."
5450,Play this game if you like games and friends
5451,I like it.
5452,"Great game for spending time with friends.
Gameplay satisfactory graphics for its time is also gorgeous and the genre of games itself is just great.
I RECOMMEND to play a series of these games"
5453,OUTSTANDING but 2 is better
5454,I enjoy this game so much I can't describe it! Absolute fun for 16 hours and keepin' counting!
5455,"What's not to love!

By now this is a classic. The Borderlands series has been marvelous. This first title of the series gives everything you could ask for with a FPS RPG. The leveling system, at the time it was first released, was nothing short of pure entertainment. You kill things and you grow stronger. I think with games like this that is exactly what we are looking for. The characters are off the wall and the animation and graphics do not disappoint. I think what I really love about this series is that the story is wholistically about character development. You play each character in a certain way that you choose. Yes there are limits to this of course, and occasionally you do things that you dont think your character would do, but the fact that characters develop at all in an FPS is great. Is this game the best FPS...no. Is this game the best RPG...well also no. But it is a miraculous blending of the two genres. With fantastic writing, some fun graphics, and an intuitive control system, this is a hard game to beat. The series as a whole certainly ranks in my top series titles. 

The graphics of this game remind me of a old school cell shaded game. It is reminicent of its cell shaded forefathers like XIII. It is a bit cartoony with a hint of whimsical, and when you overlay that on top of a mad max style background you get complete genious. The characters, at the end of the day are just FPS avatars. You can only slightly modify their apparel colors and yet somehow you fall in love with them. Each class system is unique and you can play each one differently. The story puts you in a strangely comforting role of, what I can only equate to, a land pirate. Which, in my opinion, is completely reasonable. The game is challenging and yet not overwhelming. Your opponents level with you and they only get bigger and badder. When you beat a boss, you feel like an awesome badass. Even more so if the boss is a badass. This game reminds me slightly of Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath in how you interact with the world around you and I could never get enough of that game. Random item drops are yet another brilliant introduction to this game. The weapons are varying and have seemingly limitless effects. To the benefit of this game, it is a pretty solid 50 hours of gameplay for a completionist. In the past, people have criticized Borderlands of being slightly repetitive. And in fairness it is true to a point. Howerver, if your only worried about the story you can get there in about 25 hours. Which means half of this is just fun fluff but I found it as simple entertainment. Beyond that you get interesting DLC coming alongside with another 15-20 hours depending on how dedicated you are. Its an incredibly versitile game as well. Sure you can play this alone for hours on end, but it is just as much fun to play with a friend. For how dated this title is, it still holds my interest. I would pick it up and play it in a heartbeat and probably will do for another five years or so. The mythos developed in this game has grown into something special and I love that. I have played all of these titles and I have never been let down. I even played the Telltale game series for this and it was one of the best story adventures I have had the pleasure to play. Writers, keep on writing. Developers, keep on developing. You will always get my money because of what you did right here in this game. Well done!"
5456,"I never finish any of the Borderlands games because they're based on grinding and the gameplay is barebones.
This one didn't even have the colorful enviroments and all you shot at was skrags and bandits. Soldier is best class rest are trash."
5457,"i love this game cause of all the humor,blood,gore,and the tons of loot u get to steal from ur friends ;p"
5458,"Great purchase value, even if you've already played the later installments in the series"
5459,Very good game that I keep going back to.
5460,WORTH BUYING
5461,"this game is an amazing piec of art
"
5462,Amazing!
5463,"(Originally written 10/12/2010)

On the world of Pandora, violence and bloodshed is common. Some unmentioned past apocalypse has made this world into a gigantic rubbish tip; many hostile creatures (some natively nasty, others mutated) and desperate, insane (sometimes both at the same time) humans roam the wastes. But a legend abounds of a great secret hidden somewhere on Pandora, the Vault, inside which lie treasures of unimaginable beauty and power.

Or so we’re told. Nothing is quite as it seems when you step into the shoes of one of four mercenaries, each with unique Action Skills, who have decided to seek the treasure for themselves: Roland, the Soldier, who is skilled in all manner of ranged weapons including his own personal Scorpio Turret; Mordecai, the Hunter, who prefers killing from a distance as well as with his trusted pet Bloodwing; Lilith, the Siren, quick as the wind with the power of phasing, doing a great deal of damage when she reappears; and Brick, the Berserker, who relies on his bare fists and can take an inordinate amount of damage.

The game plays out much like any first-person shooter; however, you have hidden stats, which are determined by leveling up, like many role-playing games. Use of a given type of weapon will increase your proficiency with it; farming (killing enemies for better and better items) is quite profitable with the millions of combinations of weapons; and, as you reach higher levels, grinding (killing enemies for experience) weaker opponents will net no tangible rewards. So, the game is basically an RPG with a shooter wrapped around it, albeit a VERY good one.

Multiplayer is handled quite well; up to four may join a server, each playing a different (or potentially the same) character; as more players join, Pandora’s denizens increase in strength. However, with many class mods (items that give a title and confer passive benefits) or level-up perks for each geared towards aiding comrades in multiplayer, the benefits of teamwork multiply.

There have been several DLC (downloadable content) packs released which extend the story and supply more of the tongue-in-cheek humor for which the game is known.

•	The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned sends you to Jakob’s Cove, a plot of land owned by one of the weapons manufacturers on Pandora, to assist Dr. Ned with stemming the flow of zombies which he’s unwittingly created. Or so it seems…
•	Mad Moxxi’s Underdome Riot is a series of challenges in the eponymous Underdome, designed to test your mettle and teamwork to their limits.
•	The Secret Armory of General Knoxx takes place after the main story; our fearless protagonists have angered one of the major weapons manufacturers, Atlas, and must stop assassination attempts as well as uncover a hidden cache lorded over by the eponymous General Knoxx.
•	Claptrap’s New Robot Revolution sees a new tactic being taken by the manufacturer Hyperion: their new Assassin Claptrap (the Claptrap is basically the protocol droid of Borderlands, helpful, annoying, but always funny – until now!) is assimilating the species of Pandora, turning them into robots themselves! Our heroes must stop the cybernetic menace and save the people of Pandora!

All in all, a wonderful game with a whole lot of replay value! I give it five out of five stars!
"
5464,Loves this game series
5465,Nice game kaka
5466,"No matter what year it is, or how much ive played this game on other consoles, this game is still one of the best games I have ever played."
5467,"I love RPG and FPS games, so this one was DEFINITELY for me. After completing Borderlands and moving on to the prequels, Borderlands remains my favorite. Some of the boss's are far much easier to take down, and the super wide variety of guns are phenomonal. The sidequests are neverending, and you can do as many as you please. You also receive and find so much money in this game compared to Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel just. 

I completed so many sidequests before progressing with the story that I was pretty over-levled than necessary and went through the game like a breeze. 

13/10, would definitely recommend to everyone!"
5468,Been playing with my girlfriend and its been one of the best gaming co-ops that ive played
5469,"TL;DR: This game used to be good when it came out. but it didn't age very well, and I'm not referring to the graphics. They also did not make this game with PC in mind (2K wrote an apology to PC gamers when coming out with BL2 if that says anything).

Long version: If you have ever played BL2 or TPS, the only thing you'll enjoy about this game is the story (which is good but I still find do be inferior to both games). The HUD and ECHO is super awkward and looks horrible and gun stats are awkwardly written. There is no mini map, only a compass which is annoying when trying to find which direction you should go, considering the maps are uneven and you cant walk in a straight line all the time. The FOV is awful and you can't adjust it. And there arent many graphics settings. The framerate appears to be locked at 60 fps , and it does not appear to be vsync because the screen tearing is awful. 

The NCPs do not talk much outside of random dialogue they say when walking by them. (Side note, Claptrap is annoying as all hell, and not even annoying but funny like in BL2 and TPS. Just annoying and you wish you could mute him). When accepting a mission, the NCPs don't talk, you have to read the description, which I find takes away some of the fun in the game, listening to the hilarious or interesting dialog, or even give you a mission briefing while running towards the objective to save time). The voice acting is kinda crappy too.

Skill trees are smaller and don't seem to do as much cool stuff as the other two games. Guns don't seem to change very much based on the manufacturer. Loot feels less satisfying to collect. You dont automatically pick up money and stuff when you walk over it which gets very annoying very quickly.

All in all, good game when it came out, but BL2 and TPS (gameplay wise for the latter anyways) set the bar so high it just isn't fun and very annoying to play."
5470,The first Borderlands [b]& the best. [/b]
5471,"one of the best co op games ever 
"
5472,"34 hours later over a span of 5 days and I've already beat the game.
Very addicting. Do not get the Moxxi's Underdome DLC. It is repetitive garbage and they added the same thing to borderlands 2.

The game can be a bit rough but in order to have the best experience with the other games, you should probably play this regardless."
5473,"I really enjoy playing this game and it's even more fun with friends.
Although i still would suggest getting borderlands 2 instead if your on a tight budget but if you want to get the full experience get them both!"
5474,Shootie Gun Fun
5475,"Gameplay: BL1<BL2 (just a little bit)
Atmosphere: BL1>BL2 (just my little preference)
Music: BL1=BL2 (did not stand out)
Loot: BL1>BL2 (if 3rd party program is used, then ""BL1<BL2"")
Story: BL1<BL2
DLC: BL1<BL2

Real talk: it's different game, it's in some regards inferior to 2 and TPS but in some shines. If you like 2 and/or TPS and have some time, give this one a chance, espacially GOTY on sale (Knoxx dlc and Claptrap dlc are ""a must"").

Charming but with flaws. Infinite midget psychos out of 1 Hellfire."
5476,"Borderlands is a great game.

Pros:
lots of weapons
lots of loot
Great gameplay
second wind system
length (30hrs on single playthrough doing all quests)
open worldness

meh:
writing
quests (go here kill this)
characters
design colors (everything looks the same)
locations (kind of bland)

cons:
didnt age well lots of screen tearing (can be fixed by enabling vsync)
nobody plays online games

overall a pretty good game

I can only say now that this game is simply pure fire. 
The characters really are lovable, the game has some kind of charm to it, I personaly like that cartoon touch and the gameplay is on point, I've had trouble playing sniper with that ""accuracy"" thing but once you get used to it, it's dope.
As always, the game is oftenly discounted since it's a Must so whatcha waitin' for? Just go for it, damn!"
5480,"Pros:  Great game, strong handling and controls, good story, fun charectors, challenges, in a mostly open world.

Cons:  Some of the map markers do not work in that you must go to X, to kill/collect Y, and place/return to Z.  Some of the missions do not work as intended.  Also, it is a loot-whore game, and there is no crafting, however you can go back and replay missions/bosses to try your luck again."

5502,"Please, be a fair customer and do not involve GTA V business here. People should not get the assumption that this amazing experience, called Borderlands, is not recommended only because an unsatisfied fan base of a completely other game.

Borderlands IS a great, enjoyable game. It has tons of content and serves different play-styles. The variety of missions, weapons etc encourage you to design your own experience in a rather interesting but simple way.
This game has it cons; mini-map is really essential here, weapon stats system is not that clear, and a more detailed preview on fast travel locations could have been a welcomed feature.
But overall I think that if you like FPS games with an integrated RPG elements you should really not miss this game.

my score is 9.2/10"

5505,Still holding up after all these years!
5506,"If you are a fan of co-op RPGs and at the same time a fan of shooters, and ESPECIALLY if you are a fan of comedy and messing arround with friends, this is the game for you! Not only does it have a story, likeable characters and many, MANY things to shoot, it has a kind of spark that no other game in the same category has. Everything is made just right: the animation style and the art fits perfectly and creates a unique atmosphere! Only game I like more that this is Borderlands 2! I recommend you try this one first, because when you try borderlands 2, you will notice all the changes they've done, all the improvements. If you did it like me, try 2 then 1, you will miss 2 for sure."

5510,"Borderlands is like a singleplayer MMO. Do quests, get loot, get bigger numbers... That's it.

+ Nice cell-shaded visual style.
+ Lots of cool randomly generated guns to loot.
+ Loot explosions.

- Repetitive gameplay: Lots of petty fetch-quests and driving back and forth.
- Practically none-existant story with a dumb ending.
- Lacks voice coverage for questlogs, too much reading.
- Too many bullet-spongy enemies.

If you're not easily bored, Borderlands can be oddly hipnotizing, with all the random guns and loot explosions. That's good enough for me :)

5511,Most explosions EVER!!!!
5512,played on lots of platforms amazing game highly recommend and I'm getting stickers now :)

5515,Worth the buy. <3
5516,"Simply the best game in Borderlands Series.
Even tho it doesn't have fancy graphic as Borderlands 2 or TPS, but it still have a pretty nice graphic, and Borderland's artstyle which is the thing I like the most.
Story is amazing and interesting, better than Borderlands 2 IMO.
Don't need to farm like hell in Borderlands 2. Awesome gears are everywhere.

The only cons of this game is map interface, even tho I already used to Skyrim's map interface, but still, can't get used to Borderlands one :/ just my own thought~

A must play game for Borderlands fans, and play with friends, its more fun.
9.5/10"
5517,"Always been a huge fan of borderlands, this game has a significant optimization..I ran this game on a pentium 4- 1.7ghz laptop with integrated Intel graphics with very few framedrops it was very playable. If you have a low end PC and don't know what it can handle, then find yourself wanting this game... Don't second guess the buy, get it. It will run on almost anything within the past 9-10 years (PC) and 3-5years(laptop) P.S. ALWAYS GET THE GOTY VERSIONS IF ALL BORDERLANDS GAMES ESPECIALLY WITH THIS SALE :)"

5523,this game is great.
5524,"I never got into the Borderlands series until the Steam Summer Sale '17. So far, I've played the original game for about eight hours as of writing this and it is amazing. Game stays at a solid 62 fps the entire time.

Pros:
-Gunplay
-Weapon variety 
-Graphics
-Amount of content 

Cons:
-Repetitive missions 

Overall, I'd give it a solid 8/10. While the mission structure is very similar, the gunplay keeps the game entertaining. For the base game and DLC I spent $7.50 and it's absolutely worth it. HLTB has the game plus extra taking 35 hours."
5525,cool game
5526,Fantastic game. Just bought 2 more copies to play with others.  I've played it multiple times and even 10 years later it's good fun and great game play.
5527,It's never get old! simply one of the best RPG game in the century
5528,"Definitely worth the money, haven't finished the game yet but so far so good."
5529,"[b]TL;DR: [i]Play this one first if you know Borderlands 2 and like guns, guns and more guns.[/i][/b]

I first played the 2, and when I played this one, things started to make sense, and I felt the regret of not playing this first. Mostly because in 2 a few mechanics changed, and changed for REALLY BETTER, and felt missing it in 1 (for example buying ammo in vending machine and checking some info about a new weapon), but that really don't affect the game itself, because it's real gold. Like, for real.

Boy, if you like guns, great humor, shooting with your guns, funny game physics (if you ever get the game, punch the car, you won't regret it), more guns, and know how well Borderlands 2 is viewed, GET THIS. And make SURE you play this one first. Even more if you're interested in the lore, don't forget to play everything in launch order.

I also recommend buy the GOTY version. The dlcs are also gold. Except for the arena, I personally don't like it."
5530,fukin still better than number 2 m8
5531,"Amazing game with a very immersive storyline that makes you want to keep playing. The characters are super fun to play as and the enemies are extremely fun to fight against. The mini map in this one is not very good and the fact that you can't up your FOV is also a little stupid but other than those two things, this game is very much worth the buy."
5532,"[i]**This game comes together with Borderlands: Game of the Year Enhanced, which is a remaster of this. Before you read forward I want you to know that I prefer that game over this one, for a number of reasons (mostly higher quality, but you can read my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ciocolici/recommended/729040?snr=1_5_9__402]review[/url]), and I highly suggest you play that one instead of this one. Also, this review has been written before playing the remaster, so please keep that in mind.[/i]

Originally started Borderlands after I have first played Tales from the Borderlands, and, of course, I came with the mindset that I will be experiencing the same awesomely-structured story. Unfortunately it was not the case, as here the story advances slowly and lots of time you feel like it stays put. I often could not differentiate the side-quest to the main one, which is either good or bad, depending on your perspective. There was also way too much wasteland everywhere, with the envirnoment always quite the same. Awesome for a while, a little repetitive with time.

I have not seen an A.I. as dumb and frustrating as the one present in this game for a huge while, if ever. And the loot is most of the time uselessl. 1 out of 20 items you find might be interesting for you to use. I can't say if that is a good thing or a bad one. For me it was frustrating, but also really rewarding when I finally got that useful ""thing"".

Also, I did not really like the way the car drives at first, but with time I got used to it. You might feel the same way when you will first have the experience. Quite weird, no idea why they made it this way.

With all its flaws there is something unique about Borderlands that will always stand apart. Something that makes you not want to stop playing. First of all the humor and the characters, and the way they are presented to you. Just amazing. Also, the gameplay. It is so darn fun. While in the first playthrough everything might seem easy to beat, the second one is really hard at times, at least for me it was. The bosses really felt like bosses and took the time to be beaten, mostly in the DLCs.

I am sure most RPG and/or FPS-lovers can fully enjoy this awesomely fun game. A unique experience that is best to be had with friends, in co-op, in my opinion."
5533,Ok.
5534,This game is SO AWEASOME.
5535,"Love it for the PS3 and now with a Steam Summer Sale making the collection cheap, going to enjoy it on the PC as well :D"
5536,you and a bus full of immigrants accidentally miss your mark and end up in south africa's seediest regions rather than the comforts of new york
5537,I love me some Borderlands no matter how old it gets.
5538,"When I first got Borderlands, it was simply because the idea of Diablo-like endless random weapon loot in a first person shooter sounded awesome. I had no interest in co-op shooters in general, and I still don't, but since playing it alone was possible I thought ""why not, the concept of the game sounds too interesting to not try"" and bought it for the XBox 360. And here I am 8 years later with every Borderlands title in my library. The humor in the games is really genuinely funny and not just ""sort of funny I guess"" like most humorous games. The combat is super fun, killing the bosses feels rewarding and the different playable characters with their skill trees give lots of replay value.

I've had Borderlands 1 not installed for a while now since I had to make room on my HDD for other stuff and Borderlands 2 & Pre-Sequel are more fun, but I just got the feeling that I need to play the first one again. Grab it from the summer sale and you will not regret it. Even if you don't generally like co-op shooters."
5539,"good game, gets boring and repatative, but its a good game non the less if you like looter based shooters/games :)"
5540,The cover says it all. Just shoot yourself.
5541,"This game is absolutely stunning. I really thought this game would be one I wasted money on, but I was wrong. After playing a few hours and getting into the story, I just couldn't put it down. It's unique gameplay and cartoony look make it a very different from other shooters I've played. The story itself is also amazing, and each boss posed some sort of challenge and was fun to fight against. And with the hundreds of thousands of unique guns and weapons you can acquire, you will not soon get bored of Borderlands. 10/10"
5542,Amazing game. Love everything about it
5543,Great game! FUn co-op!
5544,Fun game. Have spent many hours playing. :)
5545,"This game has something! Something special, as the French would call it: ""I don't know what"". 
Borderlands (and BL2) is such an easy to play game, with that I mean the controls, gameplay, missions etc are so ""fluid"". The action is great, I could recommend this to any FPS-fans or even RPG-fans. The RPG side of the game is not the main focus but it does give you a certain feeling of empowerment. 
If anyone needs another reason to play BL, BL2 or Pre-Sequel: humour! The dialogs, NPC's etc are great!
Have fun!!"
5546,Good
5547,"The Borderlands series is handsdown a must have for any FPS player. Humourous dialogue, fun mechinics, and lots of content. The only complaint I have is that you have to press E to pick up alllllll the items which gets annoying."
5548,YES
5549,"Definitely recommended

I was concerned at first, that I might not like Borderlands. I haven't played many games with styled graphics like this one before most of them I just turn away because of it, however, the graphics in this game do not reduce the immersive qualities, in fact, it really fits well.
This game has so many FPS elements, a huge amount of guns and a few RPG elements added in it too. The story is well written, you do actually care about the characters in the game."
5550,I have enjoyed blowing the heads off midgets and watching the dog things fly ragdoll style over cliffs and into walls.
5551,"Dark humor , Guns , Crazy people what more do you need?"
5552,"I love this game and I always will. Even for an old game it delivers in the premise of fun, loot and guns, lotsa guns."
5553,is good game buy it
5554,"The Borderlands games are awesome.
Borderlands 1 completely different to
Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel,
but the dialogues are funny, the gameplay is insane
and the story is lit."
5555,really nice game
5556,Nice game
5557,"Borderlands offers  an unforgettable open-world with relatively classic & efficient FPS controls, tons of loot (likely too much as a good part isn't really needed), with remarkable comic visuals, and a forgettable story that kinda ends abruptly.

Indoor gameplay is a bit lacking, although there are a couple of nicely designed levels.

The incessant course to better gear gets a bit old after a few dozen hours in the game ; I'd have enjoyed more an upgrade system, rather than constantly switching between better random weapons that are too often not completely satisfying (and thus justify the next swap).

The DLCs don't bring much new stuff, but if you enjoy the game a lot and want more of it, they are recommended as well ! :-)"
5558,Nice
5559,"Its a shame that i cant transfer over my hours that i have played on the xbox for Borderlands... i would proudly acknowledge the fact that i spent waaayy too much time obssessing over the stupid amount of loot in the game. Im not usually one of those guys who say the first of something is the best, but the original borderlands is the best, with 2 a close second (ba dum tss). its still the only game with the most rewarding and satisfying head explosions for critical shots. A great game to have in you collection."
5560,"2's gameplay is much better, but the writing and gunplay of this one still holds up. Play with friends."
5561,This is a game about cowboys and indians with a strange fellow called claps (im assuming he has chlamydia) either way its pretty fun
5562,First in the series of greats.  I'd highly recommend Borderlands for the single player or coop experience.
5563,"Really great game. Most people prefer borderlands 2, but I think I like this one better. I cant believe that I waited until 2016 to play this gem. Highly recomended."
5564,"Take two hates video game modders and single player experience gaming.  I play games once to experience them.  I continue to play games because of the creative modding communities. I don't play GTAV multi-player.  I do play it heavily modded.  Since Take-Two hates me, I am now rating every one of their games with a big downvote.  I own a significant percentage of their catalogue.  I am no longer a future customer of Take-Two. My money will go to companies like Bethesda who appreciates the Modding community.

Sorry Borderlands; sorry Red Dead; and sorry Bioshock. You might be good franchises, but your future games will no longer be on my radar."
5565,"I like the game ,it is fun and a good time killer"
5566,"This is not a review for/of Borderlands but its publisher ""Take-Two Interactive"".
They recently struck a blow agains the modding-community around GTA 4/5 - RIP OpenIV"
5567,i like it ♥
5568,Almost 10 years later and it's still one of best FPS RPG's on the market.
5569,Loved this one. Played it with just random people online but it was like a 3D Diablo with all of the loot. Highly recommended.
5570,Fov
5571,"unique kind of style and nice story
the subtitles don't always match and the dubs get kinda buggy at the end but overall great game. Probably one of my favorite ones so far"
5572,"I absolutely love this game, and am currently playing through the DLCs, which I also highly enjoy.
This is my favorite game series.

Despite what TakeTwo Interactive is doing, I still highly recommend this game, though I highly recommend against Grand Theft Auto V. 

Don't let that stop you from buying this game. 

BL is amazing, and a charm to play with a friend or friends."
5573,"Absolutely recommended if you love FPS Tons of Guns and Loot, then this game is for you! Played many hours on the PC and Xbox in single player and Co Op tons of Fun Borderlands is a Great game and the start of a Great Series"
5574,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I started smoking when i was 18.My parents warned me to stop or i might get sick or worse.... get c a n c er.After 10 years of abusing my body i got c a n c e r.I went to the hospital and luckily i got there just at the right time and after a long 6 month treatment the c a n c e r was gone but all of a sudden i played this game and got type 3 diabetes, cancer, HIV and genetile warts"
5575,"Diablo meets Doom :) I couldn't believe that such mariage can be possible, but it is and it's great. Creators even add something extra: lots of fun.
Pandora world is harsh place, but represents in funny way (claptrac robots are the best).
You can play solo as one of 4 existed chars or in co-op with up to 4 ppl. Like in Diablo more ppl = harder enemies but more experience. Also like in Diablo there is tons of stuff droping from mobs and lots of time You will spend comparing them (if You like of course). 
I played solo with all dlc's and it took me over 150 hours to finish storyline. So this is really long game, but I liked it till the end. Without co-op You can't finish all achievements.
Not everyone could like comic graphics, but I think this was special intended by creators to give more absurd feeling of the game."
5576,Good

"
5578,best game
5579,"The game is cancer, the FOV is even more cancer. FOV changing works only for host. Cancer. Fun cancer."
5580,One of the best games iv'e ever played. The gunplay is so satisfying. The character progression is amazing. The only place this game lacks is the story. Which borderlands 2 greatly improves on. Play this game!
5581,"It's like huniepop , but with 3 balls."
5582,"Take Two Recinded their misguided Open Iv Takedown, One again I can reccomend this game as It is More fun than you will know what to do with."
5583,"Take Two sent a ceist and disist order to a popular mod tool for the game GTA 5. This has disappointed me greatly as I am a huge fan of mods and fan-made content. You should be allowed to do whatever you want with software you run on YOUR computer that you PAID for. Taking it out on modders because you are too lazy/greedy to spend time or development on an anti-cheat egine is disgusting. Take Two has handled this situation in a very bad mannor. If you want a game full of microtransactions and want to be threatened to be sued if you attempt to make any mods for it, A game owned by Take Two interactive is perfect for you.

Disclaimer: This is not a review of the game but of the company who owns the game. A game is only as good as the company that is behind it."
5584,"This is a formal complaint regarding the recent actions taken by Take 2 Interactive to attack the modding scene (specifically OpenIV) around GTA V. 

Even if you are an individual who does not often take part in mods (such as myself), this should concern you as a potential customer as it has shown a distinct lack of appreciation by Take 2 for its loyal consumers.

To send a message to Take 2 that such disregard for customers is not going to be tolerated, I please ask that others who have purchased the game down vote it, find a petition to sign, and overall let your voice be heard. 

If consumers do not make a stand when publishers blatantly try to disrespect and bully their loyal customers, it will only get worse and more wide spread."
5585,Classic!
5586,"I've played the crap out of this so many times and still going strong!

A classic!"
5587,That story is so good....
5588,"I've been playing borderlands since it came out on the Xbox 360, so my hours on steam don't properly reflect the amount of time I've spent in-game. I've played through the main game at least 3-4 times using the different classes, PC was my first time playing through Claptrap Revolution and Fort Knoxx.

Anyways, straight to the point.

Pros:
- The difficulty on Playthrough 1 and Playthrough 2 is much easier to solo than the sequels, friends aren't necessary to play.
- Legendaries aren't much of a grind to get, although getting a perfect legendary does take some farming. (The feature in which the weapon's name is a darker orange the better the combination of parts are wasn't explained during normal gameplay)
- Has a solid, straightforward campaign that has a real sense of progression.
- The DLC provide plenty of loot and gameplay to make up for the rather simple list of sidequests.
- There's plenty of lore to dig into if you're into that sort of thing, although there are no direct mentions of events in Borderlands 2 or TPS.
- UNTS UNTS UNTS UNTS
- CATCH A RIIIIIDE WITH THE SCOOTERMAN! (I feel scooter had a lot more character here than in the sequels. He also has quite a bit of a potty mouth in some of the DLC content.)

Cons:
- You might need to revisit an area 2-3 times due to how the mission distribution works, which includes getting from point A to point B and back.
- Enemies having the ability to use higher tier weapons even on Playthough 1 makes combat difficult to master.
- Some of the DLC areas (noticeably Claptrap's Revolution and Fort Knoxx) are bigger than they need to be in some places, expecially with mandatory on-foot areas that span miles.
- You don't get to use vehicles you've earnt in DLC during the main playthrough.
- The geometry of some areas in the game are questionable at best, some areas you think you can fit through, you simply can't. (This doesn't include invisible walls that prevent the player going places in a vehicle)
- There's a noticeable skill wall when you reach the second mini boss of the game, which requires sidequesting to even have a chance at killing, after that the game becomes progressibely easier with each sidequest you complete, making the first actual boss of the game easier to kill than probably intended.
- Online multiplayer is basically dead, there's very few players hosting games and even then, they're mostly at the maximum DLC level, which makes gameplay too much of a cakewalk.
- Claptrap.

I would reccomend this game if you're a Borderlands fan and haven't played this installment in the series yet, or better yet, get a group of 3-4 people and buy it on sale and just have a blast."
5589,"Jack Did Nothing Wrong, ups spoilers"
5590,Fun shooter. It's all about the loot!
5591,"[h1]Borderlands is super fun and addicting, and I'd recommend it to anyone even if you're not a fan of the genre.[/h1]

I don't consider myself the biggest fan of shooters, but I enjoyed Borderlands very much. The story isn't anything to write home about and is kind of forgettable, but what makes this game is it's entertaining gameplay and loot system. I had fun playing this game alone and with buddies. Finding new weapons that are better than your current ones and figuring out what weapons work best on enemies was the best. The missions didn't vary much, mostly fetch this or kill this guy, but I didn't have a problem with that. Encountering new enemies and looking around the areas for chests and other loot made these missions enojyable.

I did not find the base game to be grindy, which worried me. I did feel like certain parts of the DLC were grindy though. Regarding the DLC, I liked that they increased the level cap and added new weapons. The storylines in them weren't anything special either except for Claptrap Revolution. Also, the areas in General Knoxx were way too big for no apparent reason. 

Borderlands gave me tons of hours of fun, and now I'm looking forward to playing the sequels.

Sometimes you will turn a corner or your camera around and not expect an enemy to be there, but other than that there are no real jump scares."
5592,`best game of all times !!!!!!!!
5593,"I have been looking for an ""FPS-type Diablo"" and this one didn't disappoint. Your craving for better weapons and exploration of the planet and the people are the driving force that makes you spend many hours playing. The game is quite tough, and you will die a lot of times, but it seems it's part of the experience. And it's art style is taken straight out of the comics, which is cool and a refreshing among the mainstream style seen in most recent games."
5594,[b] [h1] Great game that i got it for free! :3
5595,you get to shoot stuff it's cool i guess
5596,"Alien apocalypse shoot 'em up. Be the graphic novel! 
Pros: Art style is beautiful, game is huge and loads of fun. Solid gunplay. Dlc is all good, especially the zombie one. Online co-op works and is great. Borderlands is not afraid to be silly, but it mixes with the darker action well. Varried environments (especially with dlc) are well designed.
Cons: Picking stuff up is more hassle than in the sequel. Driving is fun but op, this is fixed in sequel too. Maybe too many guns? If you are ocd about it it could be an issue.
Bottom line is that you could skip this and just play Borderlands 2, but I'm not at all sorry I played it. You can see and feel the dna of UT2004 in this game, the driving, the feel of the shooting, different gametypes and mods blended together in a whole new way. Great rpg shooter that has its own charm."
5597,"-Large, sandy desert
-Bandits and psychos everywhere
-Redneck car dealers
-Alien creatures out to kill you at all times
-87 bazillion guns

Man, Texas sure is great"
5598,Don;t know why people like borderlands. Just boring fps games with bullet sponge enemies.
5599,"If you love BL2 and want to get some backstory... don't bother. Seriously, there is almost no story in this.

What I disliked:
- very little story in the main game (DLCs are a little more interesting)
- the depressing level design really exercising my graphics card's ability to render browns and grays
- while the DLC levels are more interesting to look at, they are also huge and do not give you fast-travel
- the guns are mostly just numbers, where are all the crazy guns?
- the shop and inventory UI is unhelpful, comparing lots of numbers is a pain
- [b]no minimap[/b]
- you will either breeze through fights or get slaughtered in a few seconds, there is no middle ground

What I liked:
- shooting Claptrap in the face several hundred times
- general Knoxx's slow descent into suicidal sanity


Can in principle be played on an Intel graphics card, but you will have to turn all graphics options off and the result is rather basic.
Playable without major issues under PlayOnLinux. I had to turn off dynamic shadows, those really killed the performance."
5600,"This game is louds of fun! I used to play it on my XBOX-360, with my brother. I will admit, its a little boring during the beginning, but it gets a lot better. Once you defeat Bone Head, and unlock the vehicles you will have a lot more fun.

The achievements are tough to get, but thats the fun part. :)"
5601,This is the classic borderlands where it all started with this series and it is a great place to start if you are new to the genre of game.
5602,"Entretenido, mucho estilo y muchisima personalidad.

5603,Great game
5604,"Absolutely the best first-person/RPG combo I've ever played.  Some would say Fallout is better.. but it's dark, bland and gritty.  FO has almost no color to it as an RPG should.  Borderlands, however, places the player in a similar environment but adds humor, color and many RPG aspects that competitors lack.  I highly recommend this game!"
5605,Addictive and fun... I now own this series on PC and Console... I simply can not get enough

5608,I have thouroughly enjoyed playing this game and look forward to the rest of the borderlands games.
5609,Мега охуе@#$я игра
5610,"Scales to 4k can not believe how good this looks and plays , june 5th 2017, really"
5611,"This is a great game to play if:
A. You have 3 friends willing to play
B. Each friend including yourself have a week or so to dedicate to the game
C. Everyone including yourself is competent at First Person Shooter and RPG games

After these requirments have been met fun can be had.

Otherwise, playing by yourself is a fucking slog to play through, and playing with one other person or with people you don't know or can't talk to, or don't like, is tedious and more frustrating then necessary.
Especially when you're the one carrying your possy.

I recommend it, but ultimately to a specific kind of people."
5612,Diablo 2 with guns. Timeless and perfect.
5613,"-- very dull
-- thousands of boring quests
-- not interesting skills (minor advantage in battle)
-- weak story
-  a lot of gun types, but in my opinion, rate of fire was important in battle
-  useless money (everything what you wanted you could find)
-  slow travelling across maps
-  stereotype environments(mostly grey wasteland)

*game isn't so bad, but nothing exciting in there"
5614,Repetitive game with a terrible ending. Some missions are impossible (or near impossible) unless you have someone to play with (good luck finding someone online).

5641,A great co op experience but it's successor is better.
5642,"There are no other games like Borderland. 

You are on planet pandora. A place of great beauty, great wonder, deadly enviroment and whole lot of crazy peoples looking for a vault.

Well on second thought it's pretty simple to say everything and everyone on this planet is crazy. That include every good guy, every bad guy, every company, even every robot claptrap. 

There is something about this planet that just drives you towards unstability. 

Once you set foot on pandora it will change you and make you fit in nicely and you will enjoy it. Just like how we enjoy this master piece of open-world FPS. 

The graphics is somewhat cartoonish drawing but the story and background is anything but childish. It's awesome to see things that include but not limited to head exploding, skin melting, body burning, electricution X-ray and much much more.

Music is well done, not as refined and smooth like japanese RPG but it got the job done. 

The plot is linear and not branched with no story choice really but it does have happy moment and sad moments with a little twist here and there. 

Control of the game is smooth and repsonsive and you will enjoy shooting and watching the result of carnage.

Achivements are plenty but for some of them you need coop to help and there are plenty of people you can still find online that willing to help you though. (yes.. please do get a very low level host for the dlc underdome for the 100 waves of fighting. it cut the time needed in total for each area from 8 hours to 3 hours.) Some grinding required but mostly quite straight forward and easy to get. 

Probablly too lazy to review each dlc so...
Claptrap > Noxx> Ned > Moxxi .. skip moxxi if you hating grinding.

8.5/10 for such an awesome FPS and a must play game for loot-magnet and open world game lovers."
5643,"this game has got to be the worst thing that i have ever played. all of the missions are fetch quests telling you to do the same thing over and over again. my freind and i decided to 100% the series and started with the first one. we have never wanted to end our own lives before but now it is 10:44 pm and we are doing another fetch quest in one of the dlcs. this game is terible and i would not recomend it to anyone. my freind and i are convinced that this is the incarnation of hell. the only fun part about this game is the commentary that we make as we paly. what is this magic that might make this game fun you might ask? good question. the only fun thing about this game is the urge to end your own life while at the same time ranting on how much you hate the game.  i still have one more dlc to go after we finish this quest and finnaly get to play the second game "" the good one "" . if you are truly  want to get into this series start with the second one. only play the second one. the pre  sequal is garbage and the first one needs a warning on may cause suicidle thoughts or actions


sincerly:  twkrazy"
5644,"This game is a lot of fun, I love the fact that its a shooting game which is fun just to get these different guns and use them to kill a range of different enemies. The graphics of this game are good and the storyline is in depth so it makes it a not so long but no so short type of game which is good because you dont want a game that is either or. I am really enjoying this game and i cant wait to play borderlands 2 when im done with this one"
5645,"This is a very good game. The big hook is that there are a million billion zillion different weapons you can find because they have randomly generated stats. While this is technically true quite a few weapons will feel the same but there is still a lot of variety to be found and because it's all randomly generated you never know what you are going to get. There is nothing quite like the feeling of finding a really good weapon for your build and destroying all your enemies with it. The only real issue with this game is that you can't realisitcly play co-op with people unless they are the exact same level as you as someone will be massivly over or underpowered if not. Also if you buy any DLC and play it before finishing the main story you will be overpowered when you get back to the main story. Skip the DLC until you have beaten the main story and read up on what Playthrough 2.5 is and you'll have a good time.

Also one thing to note is that I played as the Siren and used SMGs. If you are having a hard time with the game try that class/weapon combo."
5646,"I already own all the games for consoles i love theses games but never purchased all the dlc so i was really excited to play this with my sister with all the dls for so cheap, No splitscreen. Not unusual for a PC port but for a game so widely recognized for its local co-op im very displeased with my purchase. I love the Borderlands games  and i suggest buying them on PC if you dont mind playing single player but there was no visible warning and i feel a little screwed out of my cash, splitscreen isnt hard to update back into the pc port, and it even easier to inform the buyer that their product doesnt have a specific feature that it has on other platforms. its a little late now for me to do anything about it i think, but hopefully this will help inform future buyers adequately bacause the store page did not. 


tldr: No splitscreen"
5647,"The fantastic original game is still awesome after all these years.  The loot and shoot game offers plenty of replay value, and it's great co open. I got mine on sale with all 4 dlcs for a measly  $10!!!!!   10/10, still smashing heads with Brick"
5648,"The Cell Shading and colorful NPCs along with the unique weapon drops is incredibly refreshing and even more entertaining with a group of friends. Has a good amount of replay value and you have options of classes to pick from, pending your playstyle. 7/10 just because the later levels and bosses actually require more than one person to move foward and thats not so fun ):"
5649,"Spent 20 hours in this game and i never got passes a certain point becasue i fell out of interest in my current character and made a new one, But still good i suppose"
5650,"just borderlands. The beginning of it all.
so moist.."
5651,Amazing
5652,Classic and funny.
5653,"An old game and it has a few issues (Such as snipers being garbage below 95 accuracy or rocket launchers doing shit for damage) but if you enjoy the loot and shoot nature of games such as this you will enjoy your time enough. There are a few glitches scattered but nothing that would hinder or stop your progress, although the damage spike may prove a little intimidating around about the 2nd or 3rd boss and the ending drops off in challange. If you're looking for a game with a serious storyline or insane amounts of customization probably give this a miss and go to the 2nd, you won't miss much. If you're more in the market for something a little more brainless and violent then you could do worse.

Need a number? 6.5/10"
5654,Good.
5655,Amazing characters and great world. I can't recomend this enough one of my favorite games.
5656,"Pros:
-T.K. Baha

Cons:
-n/a

10/10"
5657,"recommend this game to literally anyone.., been playing it from the age of 13 and will never look back.. many many happy years on playing borderlands through out my gaming generations from 360 to ps3 to pc it has treated me very well over the time"
5658,"Borderlands is fine piece of work. You have dozens of weapons, 4 characters with diffrent skills, many enemies, and some funny situations. 

Unlucky storyline isn't as great as in Borderlands 2, it is good but not great. Also side quest are boring, most of them tell you to run somewhere kill something and get back. Npcs don't talk too much and they are not interesting. 

From dlc section i recommend everything except Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot. This is an arena when you only shoot to people.

Get game on sale 50%-75% and enjoy."
5659,"A very nostalgic piece, and a great game  and still holds up quite well by today's standards.

[b]Visuals & Graphics:[/b] 8/10
Compared to the most current game benchmarks, Borderlands definitely is quite dated, so I will base my standards back when it was released. The visual style is quite unique employing a mix of 3d and 2d elements that give off a very ""cartoony"" vibe. Not the best but with the hours you'll be spending on this game, it'll definitely grow on you.

[b]Music and Sound:[/b] 9/10
I'm not a big fan of the ambience music used in the game. The grindy gameplay + a forgettable background music will result in excruciatingly  painful grind sessions. So why the high rating? - - - No Rest for the Wicked.

[b]Characters/Plot/Story:[/b] 7/10
Some would say that Borderlands 1 has a very shallow plot, and for the most part that is true. The story doesn't get any solid direction until prequel and Borderlands 2. However, their characters are definitely interesting. Attempts at humor are so over the top they become very corny, to the point that it's laughable. You don't laugh at the jokes, you actually laugh at how corny the jokes are...

[b]Gameplay and Mechanics:[/b] 10/10
+ an example of a very successful change and experimentation of game mechanics; probably one of the pioneers in FPS-RPG hybrids
+ Standard 3-Tree Build RPG mechanics is actually successful in differentiating build path styles for certain characters.
+ Loot, Loot, Loot! - Variations of certain Rare Items are also available so the loot hunt will will definitely extend your gameplay by at least an additional 100+ hours past level cap
+ a lot of DLC, and the DLCs have a large amount of content on their own, except maybe for Moxxi, not really my thing.
- grindy... very grindy. Without merchant of death glitching or Willow Tree quest resets, getting to level cap will take forever. At higher character levels you will end up being friends with Willow tree to reset your quests so you can continously farm Destroyer and Crawmerax for Loot and XP.
- majority of the fun in the gameplay comes from playing Multiplayer online, definitely not the game I would recommend to someone who plays only Solo. needless to say, finishing 100% of the content in solo is far from impossible 

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
A strong recommendation to people who have not yet played this game. I started to play this game almost at the end of its life during the 360 days, because I tended to avoid FPS games, but it is quite enjoyable.

Played the game 100% on Brick & Lilith on the 360.
Achievement Running  it on Steam now and the enjoyment value is still there despite the dead multiplayer.
The game will speak for itself."
5660,"I love this game. I've played this game ever since its original release on the 360. I bought borderlands on Steam so I could enjoy it with some of my friends. I would recommend this game to anyone that loves open world coop 1st person shooter. Once you play this game, you will most likely be hooked for the entire series. Personally this one is my favorite out of any borderlands game you can buy."
5661,"I love this game i prefer it over part 2 even. Mostly due to the fact that legendaries are not needed to defeat enemies.
It does run a bit choppy on my RX 470 sometimes but not enough to complain but keep it in mind."
5662,"It's very good, bad guys sometimes too bullet spongy for my liking but you will enjoy this!"
5663,"Nostalgia is so strong with this one. Played back when I was 14 and my gateway drug to FPS.

PROS:
+Incredibly good soundtrack.
+Addictive if you enjoy landing shots on walking bags of dosh.
+Good humour. 14 year old me laughed, old current me still laughs.
+Lovely gun system.
+For its age, I think it works well.
+Well written for a game that's supposed to be called a ""tootie-patootie imma shootie da bootie"" game.
+Good balance of abilities. Well... except Siren. A bit OP but not so OP you can't have fun.
+DLCs are quite fun.
+Creepy ambient. Really does feel like living in a wasteland.

CONS:
-Do not play it in multiplayer unless you plan on playing the entirety of it in multiplayer. The quest journal bugs so you see the quests as completed in your friend's game even if you completed them in singleplayer. Reverse goes with singleplayer. Once you choose to go single/multi, you stay that way.
-Difficult to work on Steam.
-Gets repetitive after a while.

CONCLUSION:

Nostalgia might affect my opinion on this. I know it has flaws, but it's forgivable since it's quite old. Recommended, best with friends. Or alone if you like to unwind by splitting skulls in a satirical wasteland where it's raining guns on you."
5664,"Pretty fun most of the time, although you will swear alot when sniping. 
Music is awesome and lets you feel the emptines of the world.
It's boring to play twice, though. Might be better with friends."
5665,"This might be one of my all-time favourite PC games. Slightly ahead of Borderlands 2 because Mordecai is so fucking cool [spoiler] and because I've never got over the trauma from killing bloodwing 😢 [/spoiler].

Disclaimer
If you get triggered every time AI does something stupid then don't even bother installing."
5666,"Repetitive, mundane, virtual ""chores"". I think there was/ is a story, I can not remember. Was/ is there any point to what I am doing as I aimlessly run back and forth completing idiotic ""quests"". I keep trying it, hoping it gets better, as I love the art style, but after killing the exact same enemies, in the exact same places (since they just keep respawning over and over again) I am left with a tedious, boring grindfest...."
5667,"I Have played this Game ""Seven ways too Sunday"" on an old account !!  The Base Game is Awesome and the experience is even Better with all the DLC.     Again certain Revolver's pack a nice punch !!   1st experience with almost Cartoon-ish Graphics !!  Very Fun to play, and Listen to the Comments the characters Emote !!  very Funny  Definitely Not a Little Kids Game !!!"
5668,It's good.
5669,10/10 Would watch Bloodwing wreck all my enemies again.
5670,Game is really amazing and i love playing it. i highly recomend it for people new to first person shooters. and for the price it is really a great buy
5671,Cool game...gotta love Lilith's butt
5672,"So, I played and finished this game with my gf.

It was 30 hours of fun, in my opinion. The game is a must-buy if you are interested, and have someone to play with. The missions can get a bit repetitive sometimes. Sometimes they are really hard xd. You really have to find your way to play and get good. I recommend playing with friends as I would get bored if it was singleplayer only. It is your choice though."
5673,Alot of fun and the first of the borderlands games definetly worth playing if youve played any other borderlands games
5674,"Originally played this game on ps3 when it first came out. Although boring at times, it was a fun, humorous romp that satisfied with a gameplay loop of traveling about, hunting enemies, looting for stronger guns, and leveling. However, over time, it got harder to revisit given its weak central narrative, very static gameplay that can only be revitalized in co-op (if your friends don’t get bored within the first 2hrs like mine), and an aesthetic that went dull. 

These feelings were overshadowed by the pc’s port. Where instead of a “meh, but serviceable if you’re into its loop” game, it’s a game I can only recommend if you like spending the first 2-3hrs tinkering with .ini files. Even then, so much about the game feels nauseating. From the FoV limit to the mouse acceleration and the occasional crash that still disrupts a session despite any fixes made. Again, simple things, but for the effort expended to get the game in a playable, comfortable state, it’s still a game that’s ok at best.

Just play the sequels instead. The context of this one isn’t needed. What’s more, the sequels much more colorful and brimming with content. Alongside that, it’s built well and has the most handsome of Jacks."
5675,"A good game for its time, enhanced with coop adventures. 
The RPG element is low enough to enjoy the game, humour and guns without having to work out stats"
5676,"Fun game of its time.

But not so fun now, specially with BL2 right there, and BL3 in production."
5677,BORDERLANDS is all I need to say! Flavor audio from enemies is awesome!
5678,"Ultimate time killer.  Get it bought, get it played!"
5679,Enjoying the silly and weird references
5680,"Terrible hitboxes.
Awful Tracking.
Awful UI
Great Music.
Great environments.
Immense amount of replayability.

There are so many clipping issues, multiplayer bugs, bugged quest objectives.


YOU CAN'T MOVE IN FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE




Nonetheless i love this game"
5681,borderlands 2 is better
5682,I luv it. So far its been very addictive and I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys shooters and rpg.
5683,walking simulator. 10/10 would walk again
5684,the ultimate shooty mclooty.
5685,"A FPS/RPG set in a mad max type setting. Lots of loot from chest and bosses and a second playthrough at higher levels/difficulty making it reminiscent of Diablo.

Great game to play with friends (up to 4 player)!"
5686,one of my faveorite games of all time
5687,Great game!
5688,Endless mission simulator v1
5689,"Well, I've played the whole story and DLCs of Borderlands, enjoyed the characters a lot but if I can't recommend to someone this game cause the most of the time you have to travel from point A to B and there is not a quick ride, takes some time and makes the game less interesting more when you have to back from B to A and the new mission is near far far away. They improved this more in Borderlands 2."
5690,is you see a pyscho just run while shooting or headshot them while being stationary
5691,I am obsessed with the Borderlands Series.
5692,"If youve never played the original, you really should. BL2 moves faster. Its a little more dynamic. But if - just like everyone else - played BL2 first and loved it, and then played BLTPS and thought ""mehh"", then you owe to yourself to play this at least once. Get it on sale for $5. You wont regret it."
5693,"Love it! Excellent mix between FPS and RPG.

The cartoony style makes it age very well and I can hardly believe that this game is 8 years old now.

Main story and side missions mix very well and are sometimes even hard to distinguish. The quests are well thought out and gives a sense of progress even though the main idea of the game is ""shoot your way through until you reach your objective""."
5694,Game worth buying and playing for sure. If you are fan of FPS + RPG you will love it.
5695,still an amazing game 12/10
5696,"One of the best games ever, played it solo, with friends, was my best experience ever"
5697,"I beat every mission and every side mission in 27 hours. Was dissapointed when most of the main storyline had no voice acting. It is one of the most fluid fps games I have every played but had the worst ending of any game I have ever played and Its storyline was uninteresting. Im going to continue on to Borderlands Pre-Sequel and Blands 2, hopefully they are better.  I give this game a 5/10.
"
5698,"I like the Borderlands game series (except for the one made by Telltale). 
Its fun to play with friends, its challenging and has a good replay value.
I played this game on three platforms, and still do play it from time to time, thats proves that game has its own charm and even maybe ""soul"".
But damm, it has bad storyline (actualy every Borderland game has bad storyline (except the one by Telltale)

Any way I recomend to play this game if you fan of looting and lvling!

[h1]Message to the DEVs, please make a good storyline in the next Borderlands game, and PLEASE make items more unique, turn on your mind to make GOOD AND UNIQUIE LOOKING ITEMS, because most of items look same! [/h1]"
5699,"Really great. So satisfying to find a weapon rack and find a cool gun.

Gets a bit lonely in singleplayer since there aren't any multiplayer servers.

Amazing game overall."
5700,Fun game for co-op or singleplayer. Quirky but not silly.
5701,"Although I am not much of a FPS fan, I enjoyed Borderlands.
 I played through the entirety with my friend, and had a damn good time.

The graphics are nice, and due to the art style will stand the test of time. 
The story is pretty average, and just sets the stage for you to kill things.
The guns are fun to use, and the loot drops make the gameplay addictive. 

Great fun, but I can imagine it may get a little stale if played solo.

7/10"
5702,The fact that they went back and added steamworks support to replace the old defunct gamespy client really shows dedication to their product.
5703,"Many, many hours of gameplay. The graphics, due Borderlands' unique style, haven't aged at all. This is not a game where you can rush to the end and call it quits. All DLCs are great. 
 - Controller? Mouse? Keyboard? Telekinetic augmentation device? They all work.
 - Fully playable offline.
 - Any chest can have a better weapon than what you already have.
 - Every class is awesome.
 - The right amount of difficulty where it's not an endless grind but it's not all downhill cookie-cutter either. 
 - Dope story
 - Awesome characters
 - Downright hilarious
 - Just buy it. You need it, steam's got it, what are you waiting for?
 - On the downside, headshots have to be neckshots and vehicles are overpowered. But, meh."
5704,"What can I say? This is a really good game.
I liked almost everything that this game offered. I finished it around 3 times on Steam and every time I felt good playing it.
It's worth the money, especially with the DLCs. The story is decent, sounds and visuals are great too. The characters are a bit lacking, as in more voice acting would've been nice, but it's not that big of a deal. The quests entertained me the entire time I played; some were more difficult than others, but it's not something that can't be done with a bit of thinking and effort.
It's a wonderful game, I can barely find bad points- not sure if I have any. It has co-op, which makes the game even more interesting and worth while. I'd rate it 10/10 (as in 1- very bad, 10 - very good)."
5705,All around good game but the fov is shit. But otherwise it's a great shooter.
5706,"[h1]Borderlands is little crazy, but fun.[/h1]

I had Borderlands in my library but for the longest time the cartoonish graphics were turning me away. I decided to give a game a try after recommendation and I really liked the gun play. Story was kinda weak as me trying to open the vault by killing thousands of locals makes little sense; however, it is incredibly fun to do.

[b]Pros[/b]
+ Gameplay is fun and easy
+ Variety of weapons and skills
+ Love being a sniper
+ Machine gun vehicles

[b]Cons[/b]
- Weak story
- Lots of side quests that were repetitive

This is very good game with great shooting mechanics. I truly loved sniping the enemies. From what I heard Borderlands 2 has much better story so thats next.
"
5707,Meh
5708,Bloody Amazing
5709,"The game has a gun set for every type of character, The levels are well designed, The storyline is well driven with interest rather than boredom, the bosses are epic, the beats are satisfying, the beasts are beasts, and the characters are memorable. The only bad things I can say about this game is that the driving system sucks ass with a keyboard and mouse, where as you have to steer with your mouse rather than the keyboard like most driving games and the graphics look all VHS style making me feel nauseous, don't know if that's just me or the game. Overall I give this game a 9.9999999999999/10.
Great game 2K!"
5710,A great game to kill some time with.  And when you get tired of shooting the baddies - few things are more satisfying than running them over with a car...  :)
5711,alot of fun still even after all these years
5712,"If you love Borderlands and you have got some bucks left , then i definetely recommend it , even if its pretty old and the graphics arent that great"
5713,"A classic, love it!!"
5714,This game is one of my favorite games ever created. I played so much of it when I was younger and even now i still thoroughly enjoy the game to this day. You can (and most likely will) spend 100's of hours in this game and its sequels. In simple terms this game is totally worth buying and everyone should atleast play through the whole series at least once in their life.
5715,"I've owned this game for years now, and I must say it's still fun to play.
The 4 player COOP sets the bar for other games and really makes this game shine.
In fact it gets better with more players.
Very high replayability, just like it's successors."
5716,If you love looting then this game is for you!
5717,"I don't actually have the game but I played it shortly after it came out on Xbox 360. Loved the game and still love it. My one and only problem though is the fact that steam is selling for $20 bucks and $30 for game of the year edition. The game is 8 years old now and while it's still super fun, I don't fell the price is justified. I reccomend the game but look to see if ya can get it cheaper somewhere else."
5718,great game i recomend playing it with friends
5719,"Entertaining for the first hours, then it gets repetitive and boring.

Too much focus on stats: two level below target? Cant kill anything. Two levels above? No challenge at all.

Lack of FOV change made me dizzy in the more confused fights.

Will still vote it positively, but barely."
5720,"Absolutely one of the best games I've ever played! 

Great gameplay, great story - all in all it gives you a time well wasted! 

"
5721,"I felt Blands 1 was slow to get into things, but once you finally do it's absolutely incredible. In my opinion, the game still has as much playability as it did when it was first released. It's even better with co-op and the DLC is a nice addition."
5722,The game is alright. I recommend it when it goes on sale.
5723,i have an overabundance of turkeys
5724,"Borderlands is a game full of humor and roleplaying. It is unique, combining first person shooter with role playing. It has an interesting storyline with a satisfying ending. I reccomend you to buy it and play it."
5725,"Borderlands is first person action shooter with RPG and player customization. Vehicular combat for incredible layers of gameplay depth. The game features a groundbreaking content generation system allowing for near endless variety in missions, environments, enemies, weapons, item drops and character customization. Borderlands allow to 4 players cooperation and share the same game experience simultaneously. Players can freely join or leave each other's games at anytime, or choose to play in the full singleplayer mode. The game also boasts lifelike character animations, impressive real-time physics, and customizable vehicles.

In the hostile, bandit-ridden planet of Pandora, there is one thing that draws off-world attention: The Vault. This mysterious alien structure is rumored to hold treasures of fantastic power and wealth, and so it attracts fortune-seeking corporations and individuals alike. In Borderlands, you are one such individual, but the satisfaction of unlocking the Vault's secrets pales in comparison to the rollicking good time you'll have on your way there. Borderlands is all about the journey, not the destination, and like most trips, this one is much better when you have some friends along for the ride.

We have four characters in total to play. The Hunter who can release a vicious bird of prey, the Soldier that can throw down an automatic turret flanked by shields or the Siren that can turn invisible and speedy, damaging all enemies in the vicinity and the Berserker who flies into a damage resistant rage and delivers brutal punches to his enemies.

 The constant stream of loot and experience is rewarding, and sharing it with some friends makes the experience that much richer and more exciting. Pandora is still a great planet to visit if you want to shoot some stuff and reap the rewards. Even in time when we get Borderlands 2 and B3 is coming. There is always time for some classic to see how then game have look'd."
5726,"If you like the art style, humour and FPS games in general, you'll have quite a bit of fun. If you're looking for a more polished game with a coherent narrative or some variation on the shooter formula, give this one a pass. Nothing to write home about after all."
5727,"Despite my love of the game serries and the insatiable need to play through all of the games in order of story. I can't bring myself to play this one. Mainly due to te fact that i can't
a) rebind any of the controller buttons in any fasion
b) get the game to run smoothly, despite the vastly more powerful comp than whats needed
c) shoot with any accuracy (mouse and keyboard) due to hidden game mechanics

If any of that doen't bother you, then by all means play on."
5728,"I finished every Borderlands game multiple times on launch. This time, however, I decided to replay all of them right after each other. Just keep in mind that while reviewing this game, I might compare some aspects to other Borderlands games.

Borderlands lets you play the story of a vault hunter, while shooting your way through thousands of enemy's and looting everything they drop. And you will be looting. A lot. Borderlands has tons of loot, and millions of different guns, shields, grenades and more. Loot comes from killing enemy's, completing missions and opening thousands of chests, containers etc.  One downside to the loot system in this Borderlands is, after a while you've seen about everything since weapons start playing the same. In future Borderlands games, weapons have a lot more weird effects and abilities. This causes the loot to be even more interesting and random, since you keep finding new and unique weapons. Future Borderlands games also have even more loot, so more chances for awesome guns! Nevertheless there's still plenty of awesome loot in this Borderlands! Before the game starts, you have the ability to choose from one of the hero's to play with. Each hero has unique skills and abilities to level up and use. Although some skills you can unlock feel kind a useless.

Borderlands is the most fun with friends. Comparing your weapons, deciding who gets the loot etc. The game has some really great humor to enjoy with friends as well. A lot of funny characters, dialog and enemy voice lines. Especially Claptrap is great. He's this funny little robot that helps you through the game by giving information and providing missions. Speaking about missions, there's a ton. Main missions will take you about 20-25 hours, but that's just the start. There's a lot of side missions and when finished, you can start the whole game over with higher levels, better loot, stronger enemy's and more skills to unlock! Keep in mind,  if you don't do sidequest, the game can get a bit harder at times due to high level enemy's. When switching to a sidequest, be sure to remember what the current main mission is. There's no indicator that shows what type of mission it is.

Borderlands has cartoon-style graphics, which are a bit more grittier/darker than future Borderlands games. This is a great choice on the one hand, as it gives you more of a feeling you're in a wasteland with bandits. On the other hand, Since all locations have the same color pallet, they can feel a bit repetitive at times, even though they're not. Gunplay can require some getting used to, as they feel a bit clunky if you're used to other shooters, but after a while it plays great!

The main game has an ""okay"" story, it's nothing special and can feel a bit empty/unsatisfying at times. Especially towards the ending. Now, does this really matter al that much? No. Yea, of course the game would be even more fun if the main story was a bit better and had a bit more content. But there's some funny sidequests which makes up for it a bit, and the game is aimed more towards looting and having a blast killing everyone you see anyway! DLC's are fun, and add some new locations,enemy's, missions and loot. If you can't get enough of the main game, DLC's are recommended for sure!

Would I recommend Borderlands? Yea! All of the Borderlands games are amazing, and so is this one! Even many years and playthroughs later I still enjoy every minute of it! Great locations, funny characters, different enemy's and a TON of loot make this an excellent game."
5729,This game is fun
5730,Good fps rpg gmaeplay set in a well realized desert planet with hilarious characters.
5731,"It's fun and a decent game, but not as good as the others. Only really worth your time if you care about the borderlands lore."
5732,borenglands
5733,"Although it's not as polished as borderlands 2,  I still like it's loot system and gunplay the best.  I dont know how to describe it but the guns in this game have a weighty feel that borderlands 2 lacks."
5734,It's a great role playing first person shooter game with easy to understand controls.
5735,Cool game but why does it keep crashing?That is basically my only problem but its so much of a problem it completely ruins the game forcing me to rage-quit.But im sure its just my crappy PC so anyone with a goood pc would love it.
5736,"Got this game in a sale with loads of other borderlands titles and dlc, eally enjoying it so far, the graphics are really cool love the cartoonness of it all, loads of content and story, will recomend"
5737,"For me, as a Borderlands fan, it's a bit difficult to go back to the first game, as the second one does everything better.

If you want to know where it all started, the first game does a really great job of making you feel like it's just you (or you + a couple of friends) versus the entire planet. The washed out colours, compared to Borderlands 2's rich ones, also reinforce that feeling. When the more powerful enemies appear out of nowhere to ambush you, they are much more intimidating. And of course, there's loads and loads of guns.

The wacky humor that persists throughout the entirety of the second game only begins to show in the 1's expansions/DLCs. Personally, having those in addition to the main game makes it seem more 'complete', if that makes any sense.

Bottom line - It's not as good as the sequel, but it's still a really good game, especially if you get the GOTY, a couple of friends or both."
5738,"Never been more suprised by a game I got on sale. This game was great. The graphics aren't top notch, but that's the charm of this game. I spent hours and hours on this, uninstalled it and a few months later reinstalled and played it all over again. Great game, much better than Borderlands 2, though I did buy and enjoy that one also. If you can get this for $10 like I did, it's worth the money. Enjoy."
5739,I love ❤️ this game👌it makes me tremble 😫💦💦at the thought of picking up a gun before my friend✊🏻✊🏻 just to see how mad 😡😡 he gets when he called 📞📞 it at the start🎬🏁🏁🎬
5740,"Incredibly boring tutorial section, not enticed to continue playing.  Will enjoy my refund."
5741,I played this back on the 360 and even then it was a very fun game. think of a very different artstyle fps rpg with a very good progression system with an open world and weapon farming and that's pretty much borderlands. very good.
5742,im sure it'd be good if I playeed it
5743,Iconic
5744,"Played this just about a decade ago on the Xbox with my older brother, and it was fun as hell. I loved going back and experiencing the nostalgia in the main game including the DLCs. My main goal was to get all of the achievements which I think I can still do. If you were to rush the DLCs though it'd take you about an hour to complete, however if you take your time and explore different places it's pretty fun."
5745,:)
5746,"The game that started it all...

I can't say enough good about this title and series. I've poured so many hours into these games and love them uncondiotionally as my favourite game series ever.

Obviously this game isn't for everyone. You either love it or hate it. But if you give it a chance it is sure to win you over with it's fantastic Art style, Soundtrack, Storyline, Characters, Mechanics and over the top badass Hilarity. 

Great price for a whole lot of fun. Grab a few friends and have a blast!"
5747,GREAT AS BAALLLSSS
5748,"Its was great when it came out. And its great now. I prefer this to number 2 because the 'edge/hardcore' kept disapearing as I sunk lower and deeper into the Borderlands pit (In extreamly specific circumstances). Still great games of course. But this has to be my top dog!

-Tiny metal boxes of personality never hit the floor so good!!

5750,"That's game is actually way more fun that I expected it to be. I finished the main story in just over 24 hours, and played through all of the DLC (which was actually pretty fun) in about 12 hours. Each type of weapon is fun to use, and although the game has a similar color palette most of the way through, the environments never get boring. My only complaint with this game is the amount of backtracking you need to do. Finish a quest? Go back to the quest giver. Get a new quest, go back to an area you were just in. Aside from that, there is a lot to keep you busy in this game. It has a decent amount of replay value as well due to the 4 different classes available, all with unique skill trees from each other. I give this game a 7.5/10."
5751,"decent story, good rpg and tons of fun, best with a friend
8/10"
5752,"Best one in the series; no unnecessary unskippable cutscenes or annoying characters, and secretly has more weapons than the later games."
5753,"An amazing RPG/FPS! Great story and great game mechanics. Love character classes distinctions, doesn't feel like characters are the same with a different paint job. The whole cowboys in space + post-apocalyptic feel is fantastic!"
5754,"i can't even fatham how much i love this frickin game.

like dude, they slap you in this nutty-ass world filled with bandits and monster's in an open world shooter that has an astounding multiplayer and OH GOOD GAMEPLAY? 

alot of games have been either really good or really aids.

and this is one of the better ones, so if your don't have it.........

seriously, what are you even doing bro.

buy dis game 

*P.S* G2a.com has it WAYYYYYYY cheaper, so go there."

5762,Never gets old.
5763,"I found this game interesting because some of the new games, like Gears of war Kind of copy the game format. Sometimes when you go to fight a boss they will have multiple of smaller guys to make it harder but if you know how to use them to ur advatage then the game gets quit easy"
5764,"It's only fun with friends, and your friends would probably rather play Borderlands 2 or a newer game. As for SP, the guns are cool, but the enemies are all the same generic nutjobs. Playing alone makes the game harder, and not in a fun way, more like in a ""all the enemies are bullet sponges"" way. Driving in this game is just horrible. I don't recommend this game, especially not in 2017."
5765,"This is my second attempt at getting into this game and finally beating it. I bought it years back on the PS3, put a few hours into it and even tried co-op with my younger brother and the game never clicked for me, especially because controllers suck for aiming. So I decided to give it another chance on PC. And holy sh[i][/i]it am I bored to tears with this. I'm barely 5 hours in at level 14 and I seriously have to ask if this sh[i][/i]it gets better later and is even worth going through. Because the combat really isn't my thing. I don't know how anybody can look at skill-based FPS gameplay and dice-based RPG gameplay and think that a combination of the two would in any way improve on either of the two. It's so weird to shoot your way through bandits without a sweat but if the identical bandit is a measly 2 levels above you, you can't take the fu[i][/i]cker down. Hell, even enemies on the same level as you are bullet sponges. 

To me there's also not much incentive to look for newer and better guns. I get that there is a subset of people who feel that new gear is one of the most essential things in a game, but what point is a gun with 2% better accuracy, 5% more damage and a different elemental effect when the core gameplay is this insubstantial? How do you motivate yourself to drudge through the grind of identical environments and enemies (which naturally constantly respawn and nag you even if you're 10 levels higher) when the only payoff at the end is marginal stat increases? Because it sure as sh[i][/i]it ain't because of the story. The premise is about as simplistic as it gets and for all the pompous character introductions there's hardly any actual character to these characters. They don't react to anything you do and are basically static pieces of furniture in this world.

Quests also aren't really all that interesting. They consist of the same basic fetch quest over and over again and since you can only have one quest active at a time, it's entirely possible for you to trek through a stretch of hostile environment to fill up your current quota only to realize that another quest needs you to go to the same damn place all over again. I tried to be clever with three quests I got simultaneously and look up their destinations beforehand so I only had to wander through that particular section of the game once to gather all the necessary items, but it got really annoying. Why isn't there the ability to see markers on the map for all your open quests? You could save so much time.

But saving time isn't what we're here for. Because the UI does its best to waste as much time as possible. Comparing weapons is a fu[i][/i]cking chore in this game and as mentioned before, the marginal stat increases don't incentivise me to go through that process over and over again. Coupled with the extremely limited inventory space means if you want to have the best stuff you constantly need to be comparing absolutely everything. 

I guess if you’re the type of gamer who can tolerate an endless grind that serves only to increase your stats over time,  you’ll end up having fun with this, but anybody who demands more from their games both in terms of gameplay as well as narrative should skip [i]Snorderbland[/i]. I don’t care that I write this review after only 5 hours of playing, it’s as much as I can stomach of this borefest. It just mystifies my how people can call this one of the greatest games of all time."
5766,It badass game for badass player
5767,"Borderlands is a classic, just wish they thought of the minimap earlier"
5768,The beginning of a revolution of amazing humor.
5769,"A good game, just a great game, the most that play with friends.(* ˚ω˚ *)
"
5770,Great game. All the Loot. All the time. Its a must have
5771,"I heard a lot about Borderlands before I started playing, and it was generally ""It's an okay game. The second one is much better though."" Hearing that kinda lowered my expectations a lot until I actually jumped in head deep. I saw a lot goin on in my hours of playing the main story. Good and Bad alike. I will name off some noticable things that I saw in my first playthrough.

1. The looks of the game is a bit rustic which isn't too bad. In my opinion it just means it will play better on lower end PCs which is always a plus for me. I did feel like overtime, my eyes strained a bit more through on Borderlands than most games. I believe it's just the outlining of just about everything in the game stabbing my eyes when you flick your camera around. Nothing too serious. 

2. The humor is on point. What I think Borderlands does well that a lot of other games don't do is bring a strong sense of silly and goofy humor and make it work. Some of it is a bit of a cliche, but it's placed where it isn't an issue and it's still enjoyable. My favorite moments are the little sub-text when you enter a boss fight. 

3. MMO based questing. One of the things I noticed right away in the first hour was the questing mechanics. Oh boy does it bring me back to MMOs where it's go to Point A to B and getting mote text than voice. Don't get the wrong idea though. The amount of things between A and B is quite significant. I spent a good 20mins on one piece of a quest becuase I enjoyed just shooting people from the top of a building. So, in my opinion, the questing systems can be off putting if you hate read-a-longs when it comes to stories. As for me, I didn't mind it too much since the text was a bit humerous. 

4. Difficulty. This game can be quite difficult on your first run in the beginning half. Im not sure if I am just terrible, but I did find myself getting pinned a lot waiting for my shield to regen in the early half before I started overleveling myself.

5. The DLC. I won't spoil anything so don't worry, but I will say that the DLC really makes this game complete. The base game in my opinion was ""okay"" however the DLC really made me love this game. I won't go into details, but get the DLC. If you can only get one, get Dr Ned's Zombie Island. That one is the one I felt really gave me a challenge without overdoing it. Plus it has the best refrence I have seen in a god awful long time that made me estatic.

I may have missed some crucial points here and there and may even drabbled on a bit, but overall, I think Borderlands is a great game due to it's unique humor and how it takes itself. It doesn't really focus on a great story or amazing visuals. What it really does well is what most games should do and that is focus on fun. Out of all the things I can say, Borderlands was fun.
"
5772,"I'm gonna keep this short, but this game is one of my favorite games ever.  I don't have that many hours on steam, but I have hundreds of hours on the ps3 version.  I remember playing with my friend all the time for hours on end, and having the greatest time of my life.  This game is just amazing.  Idk why but I love this games way more than borderlands 2.  Borderlands 2 game just doesn't have the same ""alone in a wasteland"" feel.  The music just adds to the feel so well.



Buy this game. Now.
"
5773,"is rly gud
10/10"
5774,"As with all FPS, I'm in favor of being able to adjust the control scheme to a universal system; Borderlands allowed me to do just that. Good keymapping options. 

Granted, it's not Skyrim. Gee, what a surprise. So invisible walls and shooting chumps who wander past an invisible fence are common. That and impassable mountains. No seamless transitions between zones but I guess it hearkens back to the arcadey style of old school insert-quarter-for-continue.

Which brings me to the art. It's a lovely combination - smooth graphics with a cartoony bent, adding to the bizarre, the strange, the zaniness that is the story and its characters. And the opening music? Brilliant. It all sums up to: ""When there's no good people, what can you do but chuckle ruefully at yourself and it all and do the best you can?"""
5775,My favorite of all the Borderlands games so far. The only complaint I have is there's no vertical sync.
5776,Have you ever wanted to kill everything with whatever you picked off the corpse of what you killed last? That's what you'll be doing here. Rooty-tooty-shooty goodness.

5778,"Fun for a short while but grows old quickly, just play Diablo."
5779,"I tried starting boarderlands2, I could not  into it. Had a friend recommend I start with boarderlands1. It made all the difference. I am eager to play boarderlands2 now."
5780,Amazing Game for its time. Yes it shows it age now against other games but it is amazing and the more people you get together the more enjoyable this one becomes. Teamplay is great in this game the loot system is always fun. Grinding can be a chore but later on the superpowered weapons you can get from the grind help immensely the story is one of the better ones ive seen across any game ive ever played. The dlc does nothing but make this game better while some of the dlc are super short the only one I have found so far to be superhard is the madd moxxi dlc. The arena fights in it can be a pain in the a** but the drops and such obtained from them can make things worth the trouble.
5781,One of the best games I've ever played! Would recommend to anyone into this type of genre.
5782,Such a great game I'm well pleased
5783,"This is definitly a good game but I find Borderlands 2 is way better.
Borderlands 1 is more sorta realistic or fallout like, it's more difficult then borderlands 2.
Borderlands 1 just got boring quick so i recommend BL2"
5784,swag
5785,This game is AMAZING!
5786,"Pros:
- There's character selection and specific perks you gain considering on who you choose.
- Leveling up isn't easy, but it's definitely not hard. I would say it's more time-consuming than anything.
- It's a perfect challenge for those who can handle dying a handful of times on missions and for those who love scavenging areas for better weapons, parts, and money.
- Money regeneration. Ammo regeneration. Enemy regeneration. You could literally just grind all of the past areas you've completed and still get a good amount of EXP.
- There's a skill tree and skill points for those who love upgrading their characters.
- Graphics are still very good when played on low so you're not missing out on much other than defined shapes and shadows.
- It get's better with time-- meaning that not only does the game reward you with transportation by vehicle AND fast travel once you've played for a while, almost every enemy you struggled with at the beginning of your journey goes down with a shot or two.

Basically if you like Fallout: New Vegas (or any RPG for that matter), you will like this game.

Cons:
- Playing on high settings for me was impossible, the lag was killing me.
- There will be times you'll feel like traveling and doing small missions are pointless and step away from the game for a while. I've gotten bored a few times with what seemed like unintentional (or intentional to make the game seem longer) grinding.
- There's life insurance that you sign up for for your character at the very start of the game so dying can cost you a SHIT ton. This will especially suck if you're one who spends your money as soon as you earn it for bigger guns and upgrades.
- There's no manual save, but there are frequent autosaves. There is also checkpoints you can travel to mimic a manual save if you'd like.

I'm only a little ways into the story but I absolutely love it and am coming to love all of the characters who make it come alive. I definitely reccommend it."

5789,Never gets old
5790,nice
5791,"I do love this game. It's aged really well visually, it's not particularly demanding and I rather enjoyed the humor. 

Unfortunately, you're going to probably struggle finding anyone to play multiplayer with unles you also convince your friends to buy it and play it with you (and you won't be able to get all the achievements without multiplayer, if that matters to you). And I'm actually tempted to buy it for some of my friends to do just that. So obviously I must think it doesn't suck."

5796,"[h1] [b] Borderlands [/b] [/h1]

[h1] [u] Pros [/u] [/h1]
[list]
[*] Beautiful art style, easy on the eyes with high texture resolutions with a medium rig, due to the game's age.
[*] Runs 60 fps beautifully on my rig (See profile for specs).
[*] Loot system is fun, and you never know what type of weapon you'll find.
[*] Skill system is extremely simple, yet done very well. Abilities for the classes in the game feel strong.
[*] Lovable characters such as Claptrap. Boss battles and important fights often have a cinematic freeze showing the character's name and a clever little one liner or joke to go with it.
[*] Gunplay is very fun. Nothing like it.
[/list]

[h1] [u] Cons [/u] [/h1]
[list]
[*] The grind can get tiring after a while, so I can only really enjoy this game in 1-2hr sitdowns.
[*] Some sounds in the game feel a bit choppy and unpolished.
[*] No FOV slider. The only way to adjust FOV is to go into the files and create presets for FOV, that get reset when entering a vehicle.
[*] The vehicles in the game are meh, wish there was more fun ways to travel. The vehicles get caught on tiny things in the enviroment.
[*] Quests and storyline fell flat for me and I really only came back to the game for the gameplay.
[/list]

[h1] [u] Side Notes [/u] [/h1]
[list]
[*] I purchased this title for ~$10 off of G2A instead of the ridiculous $20 price tag on Steam, and I feel this game is worth the $10.
[*] I have 12hr played on this title at the time of writing this review.
[*] I really only bought this title because I have played it before, and I was craving to play this game.
[/list]

[h1] [u] Summary [/u] [/h1]
Borderlands is a very raunchy, comedy-filled action adventure shooter that follows 4 characters through their journey on Pandora to find the Vault. The game's gunplay is legendary and there is nothing like it, with tons of skills and variants of weapons to use against the different enemies in the Wasteland.  

[h1] [u] The Verdict [/u] [/h1]
Borderlands is good. I rate it a 6/10."
5797,"Much Blood, Very satisfying, 10/10"
5798,"[TLDR: If you enjoy FPS games and dungeon crawlers you should definetally give this a try. Also would recommend you to get the DLCs as well as a few friends on board.]

The start of the series!

So, what can you expect here?

Borderlands is - as it calls itself - a ""loot shooter"". Which actually pretty much describes the game in its entirety - you kill stuff, you loot stuff, you sell stuff, you level up (stuff?)... Best as a more ""defined"" description you could call it a combination of ""Serious Sam"" and ""Diablo"" - shooting, over the top design meets skilltrees and loot of varying rarity.
Rarely the grind is hard or frustrating and often - especially if you play with your friends - it is fun, even.
And while Borderlands is quite old by now, its - what is best described as ""comic-esque"" - look certainly aged a bit it still looks great, due to the fact that it doesn't really go for ""realistic"".
One of the weaker points of - especially the first Borderlands - is the character balance, but since you usually fight together not against eachother this isn't really a problem, though playing as Brick - who is by far on the bottom of the power ranking - can be frustrating if you see the Mordecai instagibbing erdiens left and right.
For single player, this game is good.
In multiplayer it is awesome.
While you often have it that coop games - like this one - are more fun in groups, in BL1 and the whole series it rang so exceptionally true and only a few other games manage to be this enjoyable if you play it with friends.

Overall if you like FPS-games like Serious Sam and dungeon crawler like Diablo this is the game for you. Consider waiting until it is on sale, but even if it isn't you will get your value back."
5799,"Being a fan of the borderlands franchise, I can only recommend this game. The artstyle is very unique as well as the sense of humor (especially Claptrap). It has a very interesting plot, which will be continued in the second part of the franchise and a nice presequel.

After finishing the main story and all DLCs, I can only recommend this great game with its DLCs (Moxxi's arenas were not that great, but the other three had some nice story and quests). 

It's a great game to play together or grind on your own.

8.5/10"
5800,"some people might tell you not to play this one because its ""just the intro to pandora"", but

just shoot those people in the head with a legendary"
5801,"by far one of the best and silliest games iv'e ever played. Always makes me chuckle a little. It has the perfect balance between humor and the perfect shooter experience. reccomend it to anyone who likes a good open world shooter.
"
5802,"Damn, what can I say. Awesome graphics, fantastic game, immense fun to play whether you're doing a solo mission or online game with friends. Intense, fun, gripping, light-hearted, but full of unexpected turns. I can't recommend this game enough!"
5803,"I played the... [i]DRM-free[/i] version of this soon after it came out, around 2010. Now I've completed it again for the achievements. The graphics haven't aged well. While not utterly terrible by today's standards, they get tiresome quickly. The cel-shaded style has not stood the test of time here, perhaps due to how ""dirty"" and ""rusty"" everything is supposed to be. The core gameplay is fun though, definitely worth giving it a go. In terms of design, Borderlands is a piece of gaming history. Not a big piece mind you, not deserving a chapter of it's own but at least a big footnote. For maximum enjoyment I suggest just going through the main story and ignoring the DLCs. If you're a lore- or achievement-completionist you'll need the DLCs but then be ready for tedium and even worse writing than the main game."

5809,I cannot stop thinking about how much I want to play this game. I don't have a computer that can run it or I would be playing a lot more of this.
5810,"This game never gets old!

Finally an RPG I dont mind coming back to play on different platforms"
5811,"HIdy hidy - Overall, I love the game and just can't play it enough (or rather, often enough.)

Video: The art style of the game is very much heavy-line comic book within a 3D world, no matter the angle of sight to the object. This isn't bad, simply letting you know what to expect.

All the action takes place on a deserted planet that has an unclear history, but appears as though it is the galaxy's junk yard. And I mean that, literally. Little LOOKS new, but can look interesting. The world also certainly looks alien enough and you'll find things in the sky that have no explanation.

Audio: Perfectly good audio, plenty of excellent voice acting, even if the bad buys are a little cheesy.

Gameplay: Not bad. This is a sport of post-apocalyptic world not too different from Fallout, but everything was built with junk because it existed, not because it couldn't be fixed up. You may briefly hear ""Dueling Banjo's"" during gameplay (I kid.)

The AI in the game is actually pretty good and can give you a good groin stomp if you aren't used to FPS games or agile enemies. There are plenty of bandits to come after you. Running them over is always rather fun, too.

There are plenty of easter eggs and suprirsies in the story, so I won't mention them here, but search everywhere and maybe even become something of a packrat if you can.

Mods: There ARE mods for the game. Weapons, houses, characters, vehicles, etc. I was actually more shocked that someone hadn't really gone on to make any nude mods other than for Moxxi, but since it isn't a big deal, no worries.

Overall:

Audio: 10
Visual: 9 (Lack of interactivity is all, such as blowing up a wall to get through it or osmething similar.)
Mini-games/bonuses/easter eggs: 10

As a whole, I'd rate the game a 10/10 - And this is coming from a guy who really doesn't care for FPS games.

5812,i need to play it more before i can say for sure. i hated it on console but i'm enjoying it on PC.
5813,"I remember picking up the retail of this game when I was like 14 years old in walmart just because I liked the cover, having no idea of what I bought and ended up playing the best game ever at that time lol <3"
5814,Borderlands is such a fun game to play either solo or with a group of cherished friends. The replay value is very high and the writing fo the game is comedy gold. Do yourself a favor and check this game out for yourself!
5815,(:3｣∠)_ there goes my life
5816,"WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS, BUY THE ENHANCED GAME OF THE YEAR INSTEAD. IT IS BETTER IN EVERY WAY



If you're going to get into Borderlands for the first time, this game is a good start. It is not as good as the other games, they do everything better (well most everything). If you're playing this after playing the other games, you're definitely getting into a downgrade, but it's worth it if you're really dedicated to the series. I am a die-hard lover of Borderlands, so this was a no duh for me, but it may not do it for everyone, because of the age and some things that are hard to get past at first.

Also, the DLC is JUST AMAZING, I love it love it love it. I think it adds to the game."

5820,classic.
5821,An amazing game.
5822,This is just plain fun. Colorful characters. A comical storyline. Played a lot of instance based games but this by far has been one of my favs.  A+ Badonkadonk! TT is the best!
5823,"I have played Borderlands 2 before I have played the first part, as not all of my co-players owned Borderlands 1 back at that point. I'll review BL2 later, anyway.

Maybe, JUST maybe having played BL2 first and going into this game with high expectations has sort of clouded my judgment, but nonetheless, there is nearly nothing enjoyable about this game, especially compared to its sequel. There is almost no visible story in the entire game, even the main quest is basically just present, not more, not less. It feels next to irrelevant. The side quests are incredibly repetitive and mostly consist of: A) trying to collect weapon parts, B) killing mostly overpowered monsters that will most certainly wreck you even in a group of three rather experienced ego-shooter players and if you've just recently bought the best weapons available, C) collecting crystals in a cave full of another kind of overpowered monsters that you basically have to fight, there is rarely a way to just run through it and get through the dungeons unscathed - which would not even be the point of the game,  by the way, not in the slightest. It'd be pretty much the opposite. Ever heard of a monster hunter that's afraid of monsters? Yeah, right. That'll look convincing enough in your resumé. Good luck finding work anywhere else than Pandora.

Let us also keep in mind that Borderlands is a game released in 2009. That's not too long ago, right? You would expect it'd run at least well enough on Windows 7, 8.1 and, of course, Windows 10. You'd agree on that, right? You'd think Borderlands must run well enough? You have meen mislead, HORRIBLY. My crew and I have experienced crashes on all three systems - Windows 7, 8.1 and 10. Even more so, on Windows 10 the game does not even launch if you do not rename a certain .dll file in the game folder. At least it has not done so every time I've re-installed this son of a bitch. Now  what exactly would you do if you had no idea of computers whatsoever, and just wanted to enjoy a game that you paid some good money for? I'll be honest - there is a TON of different solutions that are supposed to fix the game, but most of them have not - not for me and not for a lot of other people. And I will admit that the fix itself is not complicated, merely a matter of seconds, but I'd expect a game released in 2009 to just WORK - considering I have recently played GTA 3 on Steam, a game first released in 2001, without ANY issues whatsoever, and a German game called Patrizier II, also released in 2001, even without Steam support not crashing a single time... this is a disgrace, hands down. Terrible coding.

In-game crashes have occasionally appeared before but have not done so in quite some time now, so that should work well enough.

The gameplay is severely unbalanced, or at least has been until about level 30 so far, regarding opponents just as colleagues. We are a group of three players and have conquered about two thirds of the game using the likes of Brick, Roland, and Lilith, myself playing the latter. While Brick's special ability has been more than useful especially in the first few hours of the game, a true difference maker that would come into play whenever Roland and I would not get the job done due to insanely overpowered opponents (that are supposed to be on OUR level, funnily enough), Roland's Scorpio ability has only begun to work properly a short while ago and Lilith's phasewalk ability is practically useless, even with a load of improvements, such as the phoenix perk and an entire rainbow of different artefacts. I have been able to compensate this massive flaw buying highly expensive weapons (that I could gladly afford most of the time, as the game appears to be rather generous when it comes to earned money) occasionally, but in many cases, I have not managed to do so. Getting your hands on a useful weapon is almost certainly a matter of pure luck, as you rarely find a weapon higher than green in the stores (the order would be white, green, blue, purple, yellow, orange, dark orange, and a cyanish color called pearlescent, with white being the most common and the weakest type of item). Only just now have I acquired a purple sort of SMG that deals a load of damage. Found it in a boss-leveled chest after finishing an insanely tough side mission. Long story short - don't waste your money on weapons in the store. They suck a lot. And that's a fact that is as sad as it is true.

Speaking of Lilith, Roland and Brick - just like Mordecai, the fourth character available to play in Borderlands, they are all enormously important characters, even for Borderlands 2 later on. You would expect to find out a lot about them in the first game, especially considering you even get to PLAY them, but no. Next to nothing. Borderlands 2 puts so much more content on display regarding these four main characters that you could almost say it contains a thousand times more of info - if you actually could divide by zero, as 1000 times 0 is still 0. It is not like I have to see a good story to find a game enjoyable, it is just that at this point, I would actually like to find SOMETHING enjoyable about Borderlands, if it is not for the setting (the Cel-Shading graphics style looks stale and boring almost everywhere, again a lot different than what we have seen in the sequel), the gameplay, the balancing, or the objectives. I mean, come on, this used to be a full price title back in the day.

We are eager to finish this game, just because we hate abandoning a game that is halfway through. However, let me tell you that A), we have found Borderlands unenjoyable after like 45 minutes of gameplay already, and B), we have never been so close to just quitting a coop game that we have started. There is only ONE thing that Borderlands does better than Borderlands 2, and that would be killing Rakks - those winged bastards certainly were and still are a major pain in the neck in the sequel, but are a lot easier to get rid of in this part. Kudos for that, Gearbox. But that's really about it.

Now Steam asks me to either recommend or not recommend a game when reviewing and you might have just almost guessed, but there is not a single reason for me to recommend buying or even playing Borderlands 1. Not even if you're the hardcore type of player that hates to leave a game series unfinished, not even if you're afraid to miss any storyline, because there literally is almost none. You want to play an enjoyable coop ego-shooter game with three friends max, roam a mostly hostile to life environment that is the planet called Pandora, kick a whole bunch of different monsters' and bandits' asses, and actually enjoy some proper storyline with despicable antagonists and loveable characters? Go and buy Borderlands 2. It's worth your money, even when it's not on sale. As for Borderlands 1, trust me when I tell you to not even try enjoying this game. It is literally the worst game I have EVER played in over 15 years of gaming and I have absolutely no idea where all the positive reviews come from. Perhaps they have originated back in the days where Borderlands was just released, when there was no other game quite like Borderlands and there was not much room to complain as the mere concept would keep players busy for hours and hours to come, but other than that, no. Sorry, not sorry.

5824,"IMPORTANT!

Bare in mind if you want to enjoy the full experience in 2017 you will have to do a few tweaks on your INI files, like FOV, V-Sync and some other stuff, I personally use SweetFx!"
5825,Nothing like returning from 360 to pc in borderlands.
5826,"Definetly not as memorable as Borderlands 2, but since I ave already played 2 many many times I figured to try 1. It feels dated, but that does not mean it's bad by any means. Still a Borderlands game, and much better than the Pre-Sequel. Give it a go."
5827,"Don't bother playing this, you'll only get a good 40 minutes out of it before the next missions are several levels above you and it turns into a full-on grind. Almost every conceivable thing in the game is bland, and was done better in the sequel! In fact-- JUST GO PLAY THE SEQUEL! It makes this look like a goddamn tech demo the developers cooked up for E3 instead of a real game. I almost regret playing Borderlands 2 first, because now I can truely see how bare-bones this game is! Even if you only like this game for the characters, they show up in the sequel as well!"
5828,REALLY GOOD
5829,"always loved the boderlands series!!!
"
5830,Ahhh where do I even start with this game? The story and charaters on the game are very funny and will keep you entertained for sure. alot of people complain about the graphics of the game but there actualy really good just cartoon like witch really just fits in with the game. As far as co-op or multiplayer goes I would defentily recommend it for that! One of the best co-op games I've played! The game has so much to do that it will keep you busy and entertained for hours on hours. I'm 160 hours in and still have tons to do! For the money you spend and the time you can put into the game makes it a really good deal! I would recomend that when you buy it though to buy the game of the year one beacuse you'll save half the money doing it that way instead of buying the game then the dlc. I will always recommend this game to others! 10/10
5831,"Amazing story.
Amazing guns.
Amazing catch-a-ride system which is more busted  than scooter's momma's girly pants.
"
5832,A classic. One of my favorite shooters. So many guns and so much to explore. I will always recommend this game.
5833,Brings Back Memories. Great Series. Worth Every Penny. Loot 'Em Up Shoot 'Em Up's Finest... SO MANY GUNS!!!
5834,"I'm sure this game holds a special place in many peoples hearts due to its originality and memorable characters.

Gameplay is fun, locations are beautiful, characters are funny, some missions are goofy and hours upon hours of content.

Definetly worth buying.

Signed: Borderlands fan since 09"
5835,Nice~
5836,"I do not know what idiot created this part of game... but getting stuck on invisible part of environment is just fckin iritating... Driving sucks, you can get stuck on almost anything...
The rest of game is solid :D"
5837,"This is my favourite game of all time.  If you are on the fence, get it now. It combines great first person shooter gameplay, RPG elements, and humor into an amazing game. THe weapon system is great, and i like it more than the second game. I have hundreds of hous on this game on the ps3, and hundreds on pc, and I still keep coming back to this game. If you played Borderlands 2 and are thinking of getting This one, do it. No, the graphics aren't the best thing you will ever see, but the game is about 8 years old now, and on max settings (which isn't that hard to run) it still looks good.

The game is almost unplayable without doing some really easy coding stuff though. There is no FOV slider in the settings, and its locked at 70 :/ so you have to add a hotkey to set it to whatever fov you want, but its super easy. I'm 14 and knew absolutly nothing about coding, and I did it. Just look it up on youtube and there is a bunch of really helpful videos. 

=============================
  BUY THE GAME OF THE YEAR EDITION
  ===========================
TRUST ME YOU NEED THE GOTY EDITION 
=============================

This game has some awesome DLC, which all together woud be more money than the GOTY edition, which comes with all the DLC. If you buy this game and like it, you will need the DLC. So just do yourself a favour and get the GOTY."
5838,every time i try to open the flippin game is says file name not found in borderlands.exe i like WTF why cant i just play the flipping game
5839,"The Borderlands series is one of my all time favorites. It has the right mix of humor and over the top action, paired with RPG elements and a compelling world to explore. On top of that it's probably hands down the best co-op experience available. An instant classic and one of the best game investments you could make. A must own for any fan of First Person Shooters!"
5840,"Good. Not as good as BL2, but still very good."
5841,good game 10/10
5842,its a fun game
5843,"A game I gonna call it ""half decent game"",basical this is a sandbox shooter with a lot of grind machenical inside.

1.there is NO story in this game, pretty much all of game content is grinding content.
2.many of glich,e nmey came from nowhere , lag spike and random drop fps while playing.
3.repetive of mission design.

thought the main core element gun fight is pretty well refined, so there really little to complian about the battle part,small part was the shotgun in all weapon are fairly short range, so fairly powercreep compare to other.="
5844,Skags are assholes
5845,ayy lmao finished the game already. gonna go to Borderlands 2 now
5846,not a very good game second one is better
5847,Good game and not a console port brings back the old memories of playing with friends.  if you like the second one you should try this out.
5848,"10/10 would play again, like skyrim with gunz - IGN"
5849,"Strip the flesh, salt the wound bha bhahahahah !!!"
5850,Great game! But wish it surported V-Sync as frame tear is frequent.
5851,"The headshots are satisfying.


What? You wanted a review? I'd buy this game just for the bloody headshots! Their brains go everywhere and you're like ""WOAHHHHH DUUUUUOOOOODDDE, DID YOU SEE THAT?"" and your friend's all like,"" no I'm looting all the loot while you kill the enemies lol""

true story. 

(It's borderlands. Fucking buy it.)"
5852,"I can't even play this keep getting ""general protection fault"" error"
5853,"As a siren, I once punched a man so hard in the face that it (his face) stretched through the entire length of the starting zone.

In that moment I had the revelation that the siren class is in fact the MOST OVER POWERED CLASS ever.

PERIOD."
5854,Hours of solo or team fun. Still good in 2017.
5855,I disliked the game part
5856,"Tons to do and a great time. Great looter-shooter with plenty of content. Biggest problem is how repetitive it is, arguably more than the sequels. Nevertheless, definitely worth a buy.

PROS:
- Lots of fun content, great value
- Decent gameplay
- Fun story
- Unique visuals and solid performance

CONS:
- Can get quite repetitive"
5857,Great  game!
5858,"At first i was really spellbound by this game, played it in coop with my grilfrind and later some time for my own. But not that long time later it became kind of stretching like chewinggum.. walkin really long distances or even using one of the vehicles, wich are pretty cool, but not upgradeble until the time i stopped playing, becomes quite anoying. After all, its a cool game, i love the endtime atmosphare, all the lovely details, but its also some kind of exhausting at some places. Nevertheless id recomend it to try."
5859,"You like hybrids? This one is definitely a mix of many old school 1st person shooters, Quake, Unreal you name it.

5860,"Let me start this review by saying this: Borderlands 2 is, so far, the best one in the series in my opinion, but only because the core game it was build on was pretty solid. That core game was the first Borderlands.

The first Borderlands is a bit raw: the skill trees are pretty basic, the inventory layout can be pretty confusing at first, there is very little dialogue in this game (unlike in its successor), and so on... For some this may be a letdown, for some a charm.

But the game already has everything what a good Borderlands should offer: lots of action, tons of different guns to try out, challenging at times especially at later playthroughs (don't let my hours fool you: I've played this game on console before. I never played the DLC, and then saw GOTY for 7.5 bucks, so I didn't hesitate for a single moment to get it), and the many different ways to kill your enemies can be really satisfying (a headshot with a sniper makes heads explode in red mist, and I'll never grow tired of it).

Old, but very cheap when it's on sale, and fun with friends, so definitely give it a try if you like shooters. It's a good introduction in the Borderlands series.

Edit: even though I don't like the fact that we'll have to wait longer for BL3 to come to Steam, I refuse to be so petty to leave negative reviews on the other games of the series that are so accessible. What kind of message is that?"
5861,:0
5862,Great first person shooter / rpg in a unique setting. Siren is OP.
5863,This is a great game to start off in the Borderlands franchise... I loved borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel and im now going back to the first one :)
5864,Boom!
5865,Brought this awesome game never regretted it
5866,10/10
5867,This game is very funny and fun its a good alternate game if your bored to play.
5868,"Amazing graphical style, refreshing humour, endless weapon choices and customisations, and Phat L00t."
5869,It's good. Buy it.
5870,"If you like loot, absurd action and a good story, then Borderlands is for you! With its randomized weapon construction system, you never what you'll get!"
5871,"Nice game, not as good as Borderlands 2 imo, but still would recommend."
5872,Best Shooter RPG game I have ever played!
5873,Great game. Runs like a charm in older machines. Would kill Claptraps again for breakfast. Get it on sale with all the DLC and you'll get at least 70 hours of fun and awesome humor.
5874,"Awesome game, perfectly challenging. Expansions complete it with so many more hours of fun gameplay. I've mastered it on all three systems."
5875,"Great.
Diablands!"
5876, i love everything about this game. BUY IT NOW!!
5877,"If you like games where you just run around shooting things, then this is the game for you. If you like games which require strategy, then forget it, try any of the Fallout games.

I find the end of level monsters really annoying, I haven’t played a game as annoying as this since my commodore 64 days. 
"
5878,"When I was in High School, this game replaced my family."
5879,I played Borderlands 2 on the PSvita and it was amazing so i couldnt resist playing Borderlands 1 on my pc!!!!
5880,"Borderlands is one of those games that you just can't stop playing.  After the first 10 minutes I was hooked.  Aside from the annoying Clap-Trap, this game is perfect.  The humor is fan-fucking-tastic, the weapons are AWESOME, the quests are your standard fetch/kill/gather/rescue but still really fun.  You'll want to do all of the side quests, some are very worth it, not just for the loot but for the wildly funny situations you'll end up in.  The bosses are challenging but fair, and are way more fun in co-op, as is the rest of the game.  Make sure to pick up the DLC, and remember to still eat, sleep, and go to work and stuff."
5881,dean is a cunt
5882,BEST GAME EVER !
5883,fun to finally be able to play this game on steam after playing it on xbox. grab some friends and get to grinding!
5884,[spoiler] Best game to play while planning your death :> [/spoiler]
5885,"It wasn't very well optimized, I bought it because I really liked borderlands 2.

That game is the benchmark, this one fell way short."
5886,"108 HOURS to level up  1 FUCKING CHARACTER to I think level 61 and beat the game and dlcs 

in truth I enjoyed this game 

9/10 tOo many guns not enough slot space

p.s . dont bother doing the dome and DONT BOTHER DOING THE LOBSTER GIANT FUCK, you will cry ooohh boy you will cry"
5887,"its a little boring at the start but after a few hours it gets really fun. This game is a classic and definately worth the money. It is the pure and unpolished form of borderlands 2. While it has no minimap and you have to pick up all the ammo and money from the ground yourself instead of just walking over it, the characters look better than in bl2, i.e. skags badass skags can be really scary here instead of just being bigger versions of the almost huggable skags in bl2. The overal atmosphere in this game truly pays tribute to the title. The plot is amazing. 10/10
"
5888,Dank
5889,"This game is probably my favorite game. I know every single bit of story in-and-out, on the back of my hand. Though it isn't as polished as its sequel, and is certainly outdated, buying and playing this before the others is the very best way to go. I would also recomending this game as a standalone title. It really is that good."
5890,I made a blast master build that can empty 6 shots from a madjack in 0.7 seconds
5891,"The graphics annoy the hell out of me and its not an open world as it made you believe. But it was not that bad. The 2nd one was alot better. If you are into these games and it is on sale, go ahead and get it. Play this one before you play the 2nd for added bonuses."
5892,"The story is beyond absent but this game is one of the best all-time. I played this game for hours on end back when it came out for the xbox 360 and the multiplayer was one of the best parts. The game doesn't hold up much and the multiplayer is beyond dead but for a ride of nostalgia, it does the trick!"
5893,"I played this after the second game, which pretty much fixed all of the first game's main problems."
5894,"Better than the Pre-Sequel, and just as good as Borderlands 2!"
5895,"the ol' borderlands, feels like a demostration of the engine but is good on it's own way.

revisiting this game i feel like it didn't age quite well.

still worth a try!"
5896,"Incredible start to an incredible series.

Pros:
Great humor
Amazing variety in guns
Fun multiplayer
Varied playable characters
Interesting NPC's
Very unique and great art style

Cons:
Default FOV is disorienting, but can be fixed without much work
No fast traveling in DLC and resets to the starting area of the DLC on reloading the game
Almost everything about the Underdome DLC except for the bank
Driving is sluggish
Some bosses aren't all that great"
5897,"This game is good very good i enjoy it xDDDDD 

Pros-
Fun
Lots of humor 
Armory glitch

Cons-
Knoxx's DLC WITH ALL THE GOD DAMN DRIVING
lack of fast travels

10/10 Would satisfy Brick again

5899,"Do not for any reason buy the normal version. I'd recommend the GOTY edition, because the normal game + DLC would be around $60, while the GOTY which has all 4 of the DLC included is half the price.

Pros:
Everything
Cons:
Nothing
DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY IT, ITS GREAT."
5900,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
5901,Kinda broken on PC to be honest. Runs like crap too.
5902,"Still an awesome game, ready to vacuum up hours of your time when you aren't paying attention to the clock.  If you somehow haven't bought it yet, what are you waiting for?  Get the Game of the Year edition - the DLCs are worth it."

5905,10/10 its borderlands nuf said
5906,Good game. After 10 hours it became boring and I deleted it. So this game just good. Nothing else. 6/10
5907,Lackluster gameplay
5908,"Buy borderlands 2 over this it is more worth your time. 
But if you cant run borderlands 2 heres your game.
"
5909,Good company but No linux port available
5910,"I tried to stop. I really did. 

In all actualty if your looking for endless amounts of fun times with your friends, (and know how to use cheat engine......), then this game is right up your alley. It has that touch of a crossbreed between a FPS and a RPG Giving it that feel of wanting to kill your friends for stealing your loot. So get this game, and do it now."
5911,"Borderlands is, without a doubt one of the most fun games i have ever played, the jokes and the puns are very good and the sense of humour is present in all parts of the game, sometimes very dark humour but if you love it as much as i do you will laugh a lot with this title, the gameplay is very fluid and not much more to add than shooter alike, but the weapons... oh the weapons, there are a total of a bazillion(if that is even a number) of guns with crazy, and sometimes not useful but rather fun effects. In addition to that there is the online gameplay, this is a title that gains a lot when is played with friends, if you like shooters, humour, and comic art this game is a must have for you"
5912,"A very flawed but very fun game. Borderlands is a very funny FPS with a lot of RPG elements and is great to co-op. It is extremely imbalanced but still fun solo, but if you have a friend to play with it's an awesome title that still holds up. I highly recommend this one."
5913,The game is good i like it it fun.
5914,"This game, even in 2017 is amazing. I have a lowend pc (I5-3570k (running at stock) 4gb of system ram and a gtx 650 ti boost) and this game is so well optimized I play it with everything cranked up at 1080p and it runs in a the frame rate lock  (62 fps according to fraps) never budging down a single frame. The loading screens are usually around 7 seconds and the story is pretty decent, the looting is pretty good, occasionally annoying but its so satisfying finding an overpowerd gun, shield, or whatever. I have only played the single player but its still good. The only 2 negative things I have to say is it can be annoying going to a place wiping everyone out then having to do it agin as a side quest for someone (its somewhat grindy but not as bad as destiny or the divison). The only other negative is objects tend to render infront of you at times which can be annoying (could be my system but this problem can be solved by turning dpeth of field on but that makes the game look blurry in the distance which i find annoying so i recommend keeping it off and deal with objects rendering infront of you occasionally."
5915,"Excellent start to the franchise. Not as good as the second, but a fun classic title to check out when on sale. 7/10"
5916,Classic co-op shooter with some cool rpg elements. If you have friends and like guns then you should probably play this game.
5917,"Pros:
-the skill trees are alright. not very deep, but it was enough to make me put some consideration into how I wanted to customize my character
-the different types of guns you can loot are cool
Cons:
-very boring if you're not playing with friends. 
-after the first few hours, it just feels like a shooter gallery with bullet sponges for enemies. 
-I got stuck in random corners/edges a lot, pretty annoying
-the sniper doesn't crit even when you're aimed directly at someone's skull sometimes 
-worst final boss I've fought in a good while. shoot the weak spot for 7 hours, hide behind cover when it charges it's laser. rinse repeat 
-weak story and ending 

hopefully the other 2 games are better, haven't played them yet"

5921,Great co-op game to play with friends.  Theres endless gameplay and you can replay through the campain with the same character.
5922,"if you like FPS games you are going to love borderlands it is such a great action/shooting game, there is always both positive and negative with games but this one don""t actually have more then two negative sides of it in my option. short said here is all of the positive stuff: the open world is amazing,has very good driving mechanics,cool and intressting characters,all characters has awesome unique skills,all dlc""s packages are fun to play,awesome weapons,good grapic engine and game engine,game performance is good to be a old game,good textures on details like buliding,weapons,cars,landscape etc,impressive sound and music,decent animations,you can see characters body when you look down,story missions and side quests are fun to play and more. and now for the negative stuff: story missions are ok could have been better,it has no story at all even tho you get story quests but they don""t make any sence while you are playing through them, one of brick""s skill is not very helpful because he just punch people and no explaination about the goal with story quests. this is all of the positive and negative things that i can think of sry it""s been years since i last wrote a review so i""m kind of rusty damn i need to this way more often. anyway it""s worth money my rate with this game is a 7/10 reason i""m giving it this rate is because it has no story. but i would still recommend this game to my friends."
5923,"this gold old as shit, and like it looks worse than the remaster + plus the remaster has more legendaries and adds head customizations, but i've somehow had less glitches on this version than the remaster. as a game itself, it's good though."
5924,Couldn't murder claptrap.
5925,Can't wait for Borderlands 3 this game is awesome
5926,I absolutely love this game. So fun and awesome!!!
5927,A very good game!It's optimized for low computers!Nice story!Good arsenal!
5928,"A true classic. It may not seem as exciting as some of its successors, but it does set up the story to make the critically-acclaimed story in Borderlands 2 even better, as it gives you a more personal relationship with each character. The weapon system is much more balanced, so in the end game you can keep on getting better weapons instead of stagnating, but the skill trees are much less refined, and as a result, Roland and Mordecai configured with specific skills are much more powerful than anything else, so there aren't matchups quite like in the later games. All in all, definitely a game I would recommend putting some time in."
5929,"I recently obtained Borderlands as part of a bundle on Steam. I had heard lots of good things about it. Unfortunately I felt a bit let down after nearly 3 hours of play time. It felt like just a bunch of fetch quests, which I felt were quite boring in the end. I couldn't really find any story in the single mode, perhaps the multiplayer was better, but didn't buy it for that. I uninstalled soon after."
5930,"Best Shooter RPG game I have ever played!
+graphic
+story
+humor

and so on..."
5931,"The game that started it all. Without a doubt the first game to start putting out ""shooters with RPG elements"", but at heart Borderlands is truly half shooter and half RPG. This can be either a downside or an upside to you. I find it amazingly enjoyable to run around interacting with the world, but if you're looking to just shoot things it can get slow. 

If you're considering buying this after playing BL2, you should definitely do it. But there are several differences between the games. BL1 is less arcade feeling than BL2 but in return you get more of a questing and exploring experience. The world is less colorful than BL2 but it's also more human. The guns are less flashy, but you'll find more of them to be more useful. The legendary guns are more plentiful, but less unique and gimmicky. The playable characters are more generic and dull, but less polarizing than BL2's (there's several skills in BL2 that do just.....nothing)

Personally, I find the dry wit of BL1 to be a huge step above BL2's more...pie-in-the-face humor. You can see this in characters like Patricia Tannis and Claptrap. In BL1 they're fleshed out and have a degree of sad charm to their quirks, but in BL2 they sort of become walking charicatures. It's a matter of personal taste, and I'll always love BL1 for kicking off my favorite franchise of all time."
5932,A lot a stuff to do and bosses with the dlc
5933,"I played a ton on PS3 but I loved it so much that I bought it for PC too.

Pros:
-Lots of guns to choose from and loot to obtain. 
-The multiplayer is amazing. 
-4 seperate characters that all have different abilities making another playthrough fun.
-The story is great! Many people are upset with the ending but I didn't mind.
-Hilarious! 

Cons:
-Pandora is a very gritty planet meaning there's a lot of brown. Adventuring means going into scrap buildings or junker towns. Not much to look.
-Some terrioties take forever to get to. You have to walk a long distance to get to somewhere, realize that you left something back, have to walk all the way back. Then, when you defeat the boss or obtain whatever, it makes you walk ALL the way back to the entrance instead of a fast travel."
5934,"Literally the most boring game I've ever played...its literally pointless sidequests with the occasional sliver of what I can only describe as a ""story"". Not to mention, everything looks like a desert, which makes all of the different locations very stale. The supposed ""humour"" within the game is few ad far between. I hope the second game is better."
5935,BEST GAME OF 2009s!
5936,A really really great game.
5937,"The beginning of a new era, very funny and enjoyable with friends"
5938,Good
5939,fun game great with friends would in fact recomend
5940,"Borderlands is the lovechild of the FPS genre using RPG elements and coupled with its celshaded visuals resulting in a runaway success that no one predicted would take off like it has. The world of Pandora is fantastically designed, incredibly tongue in cheek and whilst a little repetitive (and a little drab colourwise) the fast paced action and countless triggers just waiting to be pulled this love letter to Mad Max and the post apocalyptic genre it spawned is the first in what I would call my most recommended series to date.

Aside from the underdome the DLC campaigns are great sized expansions down different story arcs which expand interestingly on the universe of Borderlands.

Fantastic with a friend! It's like having another soldier on the field ;)"
5941,"A very unique FPS, I would recommend to anyone looking to take a break from CS:GO, CoD, etc."
5942,RNG = Random Gun Generator
5943,finished it several times and honestly could play it anytime
5944,"As of writing this review i don't look like i've played allot but trust me i have, i bought this game on xbox 360 when it first came out and sunk about 100 hours into it. If you like goofy shooters with ridiculours bosses and sweet powerups, this is the game for you!"
5945,"Really liked BL2 and finally decided to get BL.  I figured the game would be pretty dated because of its age, but was pleasantly surprised.  The game is as fun as BL2!
"
5946,10/10 one of my favourite games
5947,Really hard I have not finshed it but it's fun brick is really fun and the sniper guy I forgot his name lol. But you should try the game.
5948,A Game I Can Still Spend Hours On 10 Years After Its Release Classic 10/10
5949,This is a really cool and fun game. Playing it is a really positive experience.
5950,I recommend it 'cause of great story and good gameplay. As well as other titles .. :)
5951,"DO NOT BUY!!!

There is a known issue with this game that will lock up your computer and corrupt your saved game, all your progress  (and possibly your entire hard drive) will be unrecoverable!!

In my case, this didn't happen until about 230+hrs into the game (which I admit is a very long time) but the results were absolutely devastating:  not only did it corrupt my save-game file, it corrupted my entire operating system as well!!  I had to erase my entire hard drive and reinstall Windows 10 (and everything else on my hard drive) from scratch.  Even my restore points were no longer accessable!!  

If reinstalling an operating system and everything else on your hard drive isn't a big deal for you, then I highly recommend this game - it's absolutely brilliant.  However, for the other 99.99% of us, it's beyond reprehensible.  How has this not been addressed in a patch?  Furthmore, why isn't the possibility of having to reinstall Windows every so often not made unmistakably clear in the game description?  At the very least, a complete back-up of your computer should be listed in the system requirements!  

Double thumbs down to the GearBox and Valve for letting this go unaddressed!

 DO NOT BUY!!!"
5952,I like the blood :D
5953,great game
5954,It`s a very nice game!
5955,Lackluster gameplay and the characters are all very annoying.
5956,Excellent game so much fun always re playable just great.
5957,"One of the best FPS's ever made. Period. Im not going to go into detail why this games so awsome, Its pretty well known. If you dont like this game you take it up the ass. tell your friends"
5958,"Cool as beans! You get to blast everything, even poop!"
5959,2nd playthrough
5960,"this is a real big game and coll the game off the year edition is a cool edition
"
5961,Great game. I play this game so much. Can't wait for BL3
5962,Better than borderlands 2.
5963,"Play it on a console.  The screen tearing on this game is god awful and makes the game nearly unplayable at any resolution above 640X480, no matter what your refresh rate, fps, vsync, triple-buffering, or graphics card.  Just play it on a console or skip it entirely, it's not worth your time."
5964,"I was a bit late to the Borderlands game. To be honest, I didn't enjoy this as much as BL2. Advice to anyone getting into Borderlands, don't think that you need to play BL1 to appreciate BL2. The second game is much more fun, and stands well on it's own legs. If you're aching for more after finishing BL2 and have checked off ""be disappointed by BL:TPS"" on your To-Do list, come back and play this game."
5965,"My first impression, a shooter with RPG - nah, this will not work, after launching the game, and this cartoony graphic, meh, how people can like something like this.... after many, many months of playing... WOW ..what a game :) The game feels perfect, the difficulty is going up with you, the looting is fun and surprisingly is working with the guns and additional gear like shields. I'm playing as Hunter, although I tried Lilith for a bit, but I just don't feel complete without my upgraded ""bloodwing"". There is also quite a lot of dark humour in here, the car fights are nice as well. My only small nudge would be the world itself. I know it's unique but in some way the one big garbage dump is a bit depressing..."
5966,This game is GORGEOUS in 4k. It plays much smoother than on the PS3 and I'm still having fun after all these years!

[h1]""Welcome to Pandora.""[/h1]

[h1]Note:[/h1]
The reason as to why I don't have like 500+ hours for this so-called favorite game of mine is because those hours are on my Xbox. I played a sh*t ton of Borderlands back in the days. I played the game well over 29 times back on the Xbox. Now at this point. Well, I'm just burned out. I don't want to play any more of it for ""now"" but that doesn't mean that Borderlands is all of a sudden a terrible game. It still is my favorite game of all time but I just need a good few years of not playing it before my thirst for Borderlands resumes. 
_____________

[h1]My Story:[/h1]
Borderlands is my all time favorite game or may I say. Series. I played this game so much that even though I'm burned out with this game, I still love it to death. And to show how much I love this game we have to start from the beginning. 

Back in 2010 I was planning to get a new game, all of my friends from school were playing the brand new Call Of Duty games and I was not interested in it, I wanted something else, so I started watching this series on YouTube from this one YouTuber and it was Borderlands, I was bored and was interested in it so frankly I watched it. I loved the look of it from first sight and I knew I had to buy it.

So the next day I brought it and fired it up on my Xbox 360. It was a very confusing game at first, it is an RPG game and I never played one before so frankly it took me a while to get used to it, do note that I was also a bit young back then so it was a bit more confusing for me. After some days of watching videos and reading a bit, I got the hang of it and ho boy, did I love it. I played through the whole game, I explored every little bit of area, I finished all of the DLC's and after that, I still wanted more. So I played through the game the next 4 times with each of the characters and through my time of playing, I never got bored. I played as all four of the characters and finished the game 4 times before after moving up to the next game. 

But whenever I felt like playing something I played Borderlands, When I made a new Xbox Live account, Borderlands was the first thing I played. I even played this game so much that the disc one day broke, I won't lie, I was super heartbroken back then, so I had to buy a new copy because I loved this game to death at that point, 2 years later the disc broke again and then i was kind of burned out that I did not feel like buying it again, but later on after 2 years I had an urge to play it again, so I went to the game shop and I brought the game yet again and this time it did not break, I still have it on my game collection and even though I don't play it on the Xbox 360 anymore this game does remind me of how much I went through with this game and how much I love it. 

[h1]The Story:[/h1]
Taking place on a fictional planet. Borderlands takes place on a planet known as Pandora. A barren Wasteland filled with Bandits, Military, Mercenaries, and others. The legends of Pandora talk about a Vault full of weapons, gold, money and other treasures. The people who hunt for these Vaults are called Vault Hunters. And you may choose to play as 4 of them. Roland the Soldier, Lillith the Siren, Mordecai the Hunter and Brick as the Berserker. Your story/adventure stars off from here.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
● Gameplay
● Gunplay
● Bazillion of guns
● World/Landscape
● DLC
● Great CO-OP Experience
● Fantastic Cell-Shaded graphics [b](Borderlands has its own unique graphics.)[/b]
● Excellent and addicting gameplay
● Skills
● Levels [b](As in leveling from level 1 to level 50.)[/b]
● Game time [b](Decent amount of time is required to finish Borderlands fully.)[/b]
● Unique Characters to chose from
● Steam Achievements

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
● Hardly a story present
● Some missions can feel repetitive
● Storage area [b](There is no storage area other than the player's inventory.)[/b]
● No Steam Trading Cards
● Side missions [b](Most side missions will all play out the same way, go here, collect this or kill this etc:)[/b]
● Performance [b](Borderlands is one of those old games where it will run better on a weaker system than on a new powerful system and even then you will probably have a hard time getting over 60 FPS.)[/b]

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Conclusion? Well for me It's always a must buy. Considering that I played this game over 27 times in my lifetime. One of my all-time favorite video games. And this is where it all started for me. Borderlands 1 is a perfect game that details pretty much most of my entire Childhood and Xbox 360 Gaming Years. First-time buyer? Buy it. You will love it. And with friends. Ho boy. This game is where it becomes fun. That is where you will have the most fun. Sure it can get boring after a while but if you can finish it then Borderlands 2 is truly where everything has been improved. Give it a go.

[h1]Overall rating 1000/10[/h1]"
5968,Do you recommend this game?
5969,"The game is around guns and more guns and you never get tired of guns (they are never enough), and the way the game progress, does help the search for better ones, but gameplay and coop is the main focus, and the game provide enumerous hours of fun on that regard with friends or pub matches, doesnt really matter.

The story provide entertaining situations, and there are hilarious characters to keep the humor up, but its the gameplay that make borderlands shine, with many weapons to choose, abilities to unlock based on your playstyle or just to progress. 
Some of the missions have memorable bosses like slege and Ned, and the DLC actually add more hours of entertainement, but arent really required to fully enjoy Borderlands experience, thought Secret Armory DLC really add some nice toys.

Everything works really well, from the cartoon graphics, to sound and voice actors, the world is engaging and big enough to keep you busy, on sale or normal price, you get your money worth while if you like grind games that doesnt take it to serious."
5970,"Borderlands was a good game for its time. It was unique, it introduced great characters, a new genre and a new franchise. But playing it in 2017 definitely shows its flaws.

First negative was FOV. The game is just way too zoomed in and you have a very narrow viewing angle, but this can be very easily fixed with any of the guides on Steam (make sure to do that before playing). The inventory system was absolutely horrendous. Comparing and selling items could have been done so much better. I also did not like the way enemies received damage. For example if I am shooting at somebody in the distance, I would only know that I hit them if their health bar dropped, there was no other visual que to show that I hit them which was frustrating at times. Also the game still to this day has some bugs and glitches.

But overall the game was good introduction to the series. For anyone that played Borderlands 2 first, this game is a nice addition to the story. Or for anyone that is interested in the franchise, it a good place to start."
5971,fairly new at playing it. btu a really addicting game even when i get stuck.
5972,"Still a awesome game even to this day, I am still glad i bought this again on pc and never regreted it! get it if you can but get goty as you can also play with friend's to!"
5973,+1
5974,"Most likely the best borderlands out there, ive put quite a few hours into this gam eand although it doesnt have the extensive expansion like the second one has, i found the gameplay and characters mor fun than the second"
5975,damn i love  the art work of the game i got this game for 6 of my friends and they love it we co-op it  alot of the times i jst like shooting my friends in the ass XD when im bored you would love this game its rly good
5976,Great game lilke all Borderlands Games excpet for that Teletale game.  Those games crap.
5977,"Damn thing rewrites all configs on a reinstall. Don't you ever touch my crafty little hand-edited configs!

Still a fun game though, love it."
5978,So many WEAPONS!!!
5979,
5980,10/10 Peasant FOV
5981,"Love this game, am thinking about purchasing the second one."
5982,great game only £2 in sale
5983,"Great game, can be short or very long denpending how you play, you can either run through the story and a few hours or spend a few weeks doing all the quests and DLC this game has to offer.

I would recommend this game to anyone really."
5984,suck me jerry
5985,Texas simulator 2009
5986,Badass.
5987,A pretty good game
5988,If Juarez Mexico was fun...
5989,"Kill everything and everybody on your way to open the Vault just to find out it doesn't contain the epic loot everybody said, but a japanise wet dream
10/10 would kill everyone again"
5990,If you have not experienced Borderlands; You need to experience it.
5991,I regret waiting 9 years to play this masterpiece
5992,"i dont like the leveling system for the guns, or to be precise i dont like how the guns have such horrible accuracy. i dont think the guns need to miss when point plank of the enemy when i have a sniper and the crosshair is on their heads. other than that the game was ok but the accuracy makes me give this game a thumbs down sorry, but gun accuracy is a big thing for me."
5993,great game
5994,"Writing this review based on game/story/graphics not technical. Fun game. Can pose a real challenge at 2nd and 3rd playthrough. Probably my favorite game of all time. Guns, loot, fun and unique characters, along with fun gameplay and 3 skill trees for each character. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
5995,"I bought it, because Borderlands 2 is one of the best games I have ever played. This is a good game, but it is lightyears away from the second one. Nevertheless it is worth a try. I like the weapon masteries."
5996,"+Great introduction to the world of Borderlands
+Best shooter rpg ever (+Great comedy) 
+Many Guns and loot!
+One of the best CO-OP experiences ever for 4 people
+Graphics seem unique and the game doesn't feel that older because of that also
+All characters (Hunter, Sireen, Berserker and Soldier) seem unique and are awesome in the own way, and yet they keep it simple at the same time - Wanna go with your fists and guns blazing? Go with Brick.. Want to Snipe and have the best bird pal? Go Mordecai.. Want to be the best pal for your teammates and be good with every gun? Go with Roland.. Last but definetly not the least (imo the best) want to go with elemental SMG and destroy everything? Go Lilith, she's the boss!
+NPCs are interesting and a hell of fun - for example Athena, TK, Tannis, Claptrap, General Knoxx, Scooter 
+Boss fights are fun and challenging
+So many references and jokes
+DLCs are top notch! Except ""The Underdome"" - IMO it goes like this: Zombie Island of Dr.Ned>The Secret Armory of General Knoxx>Claptra's Robot Revolution>Moxxi's underdome
- Story may not be the best thing in the game, seems rushed some parts of the game
- Respawning mechanism seem broken at times, when you've just killed the enemies, and then you leave the area, comeback, and baam here they are again
- The Underdome DLC it's just awful, so much grinding for so little reward, and repetitive as hell
- Way too much walking and no teleports in DLCs 

[h1]Overall - 9.1/10[/h1]"
5997,One of the best video games ever made.
5998,Fun game
5999,loot and guns
6000,"If you used to play this on cosole as a child and remember the game fondly. Keep doing what you're doing, then, take 10 steps away from the computer, ignite a molotov, and throw it at this screen. You don't want this. Trust me."
6001,"btw, No"
6002,Very fun looter-shooter.
6003,This game is so fun and what a great collection to my library. Proud to say this is one of my favorites
6004,"I've played Borderlands 2 as my first game in this series, so I was excited to get this game and try it out. It was disappointing to see that it's not what I expected. There's jumping damage, no humor, none of the characters are talkative or have any spark of life to them. This game is dead and serious but boring.

Another thing is.. I'm playing as Mordecai. I like his little laughs as I get headshots with the sniper or critical kills with a shotgun but his bird is the dumbest computer AI, I ever came across... Yet her/his death in BL2 upset me. Good to know that moment of loss is wasted, no thanks to this game.

Despite this game being boring most of the time, I’m curious to what happened to Jack’s side of the story. I wanna see what happened to make him such a gigantic prick in the second one. 

Real question here though; Is this game worth it? Wish I could vote maybe, instead of yes or no. I jumped from BL2 to the first game, which caused me to feel this huge letdown. I would wait for this game to be on sale or at least wait until most of your friends have it. Maybe that way, it could be a decent game with friends to join in. Otherwise, just watch other people on youtube to get the story from there."

6006,"Easily one of the best games I ever played. Hours and hours of fun with friends and quite cheap to buy for someone you want to play with. Great content and oh so many ways to kill enemies!
Also, funny dialogues, quotes and a very unique and amazing design"
6007,"I have regretted not completing many games,this isn't one of them,
Gets boring alone."
6008,"Best shoot ups ever and you have to love claptrap AAA+++
ps way to go Moxxi"
6009,Borderlands 1 PC version is ok overall but Borderlands 2 is [u]much[/u] better in all terms. BL1 PC version has broken 70° FOV  and FPS drops on top hardware http://www.gearboxsoftware.com/2013/07/inside-the-box-field-of-view/
6010,"This may be the best Co-op game ever made. The sequel was great, but the story and variety of environments make this game the superior. The replay value is extremely high and the General Knoxx DLC is amazing."
6011,"HIghly enjoyable run and gun, with some rpg elements (guns in particular are fun to collect and assess each new found gun against existing arsenal). Played to completion, which says a lot for me, so two thumbs good on this one."
6012,"Hours and hours of gameplay, fun, crazy and epic! A great array of weapons, missions and lots of fun! Can't wait for Borderlands 3."
6013,"Classic fps game with nice rpg elements like choosing side mssions and swapping ut weapons and abilities
"
6014,Still a great game even today.
6015,"Even when being almost 8 years old this game is plenty of fun and got almost no problems at all. I have played over [strike]40[/strike] 200 hours as of this writing and not done with my [strike]first[/strike] second [strike]playthrough[/strike] character yet so there is plenty of content and you can even play it with your friends and the game will adjust the difficulty when it detects more players. A solid buy if you are thinking of starting the Borderlands series, I will definitely play Borderlands 2 after I'm done with this."
6016,"After my first Playthrough I decided to write a review to this game. 
Some time ago I always thought to myself 'Why would anyone ever play that game? It looks like crap!' But then I wanted to try it out and bought it. And I do not even regret a single Cent. This game is great, altough the story is not that good. I love the gameplay and the graphics. All in all this is a game everyone should try out."
6017,very good game!!!!!!!!
6018,"    What to say about Borderlands... So I just built my PC and this was my 2nd game. I've played all of them and all the expansions on console. I will buy them all again on the next bundle sale. It is soooooo much better on PC might I add.

 It's like playing a comic book series. 

   You got a endless amounts of weapons, great skill tree, story co-op with 3 others. I can't think of anything I don't like about these games. Buy em all just do it."
6019,"I'm the kind of person that likes to play a franchise from first released to latest released. I can confidently say that the sequel to this game is a lot better in almost every way but this one still holds up and is a lot of fun.

Sometimes the side missions feel like a repetitive grind but I guess you don't have to do them if you're just looking for the fulfilment of completing the main story. There are also a few annoying bugs but nothing too major or game-breaking."
6020,"Supposedly a good game, but  the performance issues are a bitch.

But yeah, still recommending it because it's pretty fun."
6021,"Despite some fairly iritating bugs that can crop up from time to time, Borderlands 1 is an all right experience. It hasn't aged well and there's many tweaks that need to be done in terms of optimizing setting files for this game to run well on a machine this century, but the game overall is good mindless fun. 

I think just about every aspect of BL1 is improved in BL2 to the point that this game is more or less obsolete, but it's still fun to grab when on sale to play with friends."
6022,Co op at its best but the game at times adopts the tropes of a lot of mmos. Otherwise a great game.
6023,Crap game with useless AI and horrible movement controls. Avoid like cancer. Borderlands 2 and Zero share the cake.
6024,"[i]huuntz huntz huntz - check me out![/i]
[b]PROS[/B]
+ It was GOTY 2009.
+ The graphics, like every other game of the franchise, make me feel like its a timeless game. Played in 2017, and it never felt being a 8 years old game.
+ The mecanics of the game are great.
+ Fantastic Co-op game.
+ Sense of humor!
+ Hundreds and hundreds of guns, a huge variety.
+ Wide variety of missions.
+ Completionists have some dozens of hours in this game.
+ Skilltree, perks - everything a rpg fan likes.
+ Good Story.

[b]CONS[/b]
- Mini-map would be usefull sometimes
- Some bugs here and there, almost every in the environment but never in missions.
- Saving system sometimes gets a little buggy when playing co-op. Had to repeat a couple missions.

[b]OVERALL 9.2/10[/B] - [i]A timeless game![/i]"
6025,Lilith's butt wins everything.
6026,"i.m.o the first entry in the franchise is the best overall value.
It's cheaper and has better dlc then bl2"
6027,Definetely worth playing through if you're fan of the series.
6028,"Decent, but not as good as Boarderlands 2"
6029,"with out a doubt, one of my favourite series to play.. the first game.. story line... fucking fantastic right up until 99% lol thats all i will say.. id play this game to death over and over again.. its beautifiul.. glorious to play


the only aspect i would like to address is later on in the game if you dont keep your levels up and go for rare reapon spawns.. you will find yourself runninglike shit through areas because everything begins to hurt really quick lol

the game has excellent graphics... scenarios.. cut scenes.. hilarious characters.. beautiful cities..

tiny tiny bit repetitive at times but you make up for it.. it has fast travel so i let it slide

really fun to play co op on... but a super good game to enjoy.. first of many .

i enjoyed it and have played it many times."
6030,This is a pretty good game. It has lots of shooting and action but the story is a little lacking.
6031,"Really like the cell-shaded art style and the combat of this one. However, if you're going to look at the Borderlands series, ignore this one and go straight to the second one."
6032,"too much linear....
story is sh*t....
just go go go shoot shoot shoot...
and loot loot loot.... open every box and trash in your way to get money.......
as you go enemies are getting difficult...... 
Thats all in a nutshell ....."
6033,"kind of boring if you play by yourself, much better while playing with at least one friend.

Gameplay repetitive as hell, althouth gives a lot of satisfaction from earning interesting loot

Diablo with guns and from first perspective

Recomended"
6034,America Simulator 2009
6035,"This is where it all started, and for its time , it was a good game with fun characters and abilities... if you can play this co-op , it's even more fun.. i'd say it lacks the captivating story that they developed for BL2, but for an introduction in the franchise it's okay."
6036,Fun and addictive!
6037,"I got this game after playing Borderlands 2 and pre sequal, so the story was already been told to me. When i got this i was like it will be ok, however althought at the time of writing this i have not finished the game I am finding it very fun and would say get it if it is cheap in a sale. Boarderlands 2 is still the best out of the three tho."
6038,"Played this everyday on xbox when it was first released, best shoot & loot franchise imo"
6039,GG enjoy it alot hrs of fun and endless mayhen should get woth the money!
6040,Probably my most favouritestest game of all time. 11/10. Very.... very recomended.
6041,"One of my favorite games of all time!

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The story is not something to write home about, but it is definitely the journey not the destination in Borderlands. The gameplay is great fun with a lot of awesome boss fights and weapons. There is a lot of missions in the game. They are in most cases pretty basic like [i]collect a number of ..., kill a number of...,  active a number of ...[/i]-ish type of missions, which are not bad and since they can provide a great challenge. Borderlands nails a lot of things especially the inventory, weapons comparisons and quest sorting. You will always get notified when new quest arrives, so you do not have to look them in every location you visit. After playing Borderlands it is almost frustrating to play a new game, which does not nails these fundamentals things right. There is also a skill tree which is okay. Most of the time you will be hunting for new and better weapons, which is almost a mini game itself.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
From the out side world Borderlands is probably most famous for it CEL-shading graphics, which is something people either hate or love. It definitely gives it a unique style. Character animations could be better, but it's quite impressive how detailed the maps are.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
Excellent voice acting and interesting characters. Every character has something funny immature things to say. All the characters are just a bunch of goofballs. Most of the dialog is through radio recordings, where you get to know them better. The dialog is what makes this game fun and stand out from the crowd. The game features awesome soundtracks as well.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
You can find yourself trapped hours in Borderlands just because the gameplay is so addicting. Borderlands was something I bought out of a joke, 100% guaranteed I would not like it. Borderlands surprised me, because the game is almost a joke itself. It does not take itself too seriously and that is why I like it. It also has a lot of replay value for all you looting fanatics and bring your friends a long for more enjoyable experience!"
6042,Awesome!
6043,"Borderlands is a FPS RPG with Diablo-esque twist to it. Though it may not have been the very first to start the genre, it definitely gave the genre the boost into mainstream spotlight that really put it into the light.

I've held off writing a review until I completed the game, which I had no incentive to since I wanted to play this game with my friends when it initially came out and just recently got to playing with them again. Gameplay wise, it's to be expected that it's much less detailed and fun than Borderlands 2, but it's to be expected as the streamliner for the series. 

You play as one of 4 different characters with different ability sets and unique abilities, pushing for your character to play in a certain style but not forcing it onto you. It's an FPS, but you also get scrolling combat dmg and experience to level as well as a loot grade system much like Diablo. As to be expected of one of the very first in the genre and as a game from 2009, it's got much to polish up on, but if you like to see the roots of the genre and still have fun, I'd definitely try it.

Pros:
+ Lots of guns and different uses for them, electric guns are much more effective against shields, corrosive is effective against armor, etc.
+ Get to shoot disabled midgets and crazy giants in the face with rocket launchers
+ FPS RPG

Cons:
- Quest doesn't allow you to see multiple objectives at a time, forcing you to backtrack in some cases
- Unclear with Fast Travel locations
- Eventually becomes very tedious
- Needs polishing up on a lot of things in the game
- Clap-Trap

TL;DR:
Borderlands is a FPS RPG with Diablo-esque twist to it. One of the first in the genre, has a dire need of polishing up which Borderlands 2 takes care of, but it's still a great game."
6044,"Yes Yes YEs

Shooot, guns Reload and Locked

weeeeaaaaa :D"
6045,"Cel shaded masterpiece

7/10"
6046,"Great fun, love playing with friends, enjoy the loot, would recommend modding for even more things to do."
6047,"Borderlands, the origanl First Person Shooter/Mission Based, Single Player/Co-Op campaign game of it's kind. Loved it the moment it came out in 2009 and I'm still running around in Pandora (including Borderlands 2 & The Pre-Sequel) today! I couldn't recommend the series anymore or rate it any higher.
OK ... so I'm a Borderlands franchise fanboy, but don't think that this recommendation comes with lots of doses of bias, I have introduced a couple of my friends to the Borderlands series and they have become Borderlands nuts also. But, what's not to like, it is the perfect drop in /drop out fast paced shooter, it has tons of missions to do (even more when you add the DLC's), it is pure Gun Porn with the amount of weapons that you can find, it's gameplay is as addictive as hell, it is very funny (Claptrap is a LEGEND in my eyes lol), the sheer amount of challenges/achievements, tons of lootable objects, that rainbow shower of goodies when you pop off the tougher enemies, and the cartoon style craphics just finish it off perfectly ... now add 4 player co-op for ultimate buddy fun!!!
Now the CONS, only two really.
Well, one, sort of, and one wish.
1/ (Con) 
The fact that you cannoy move once in Second Wind when playing single player, both Borderlands 2 & The Pre-Sequel allow movement in Second Wind. Nothing worse than being put into Second Wind and end up stuck behind some scenery or cover and unable to target an enemy to get that Second Wind kill because you can't move. F-R-U-S-T-R-A-T-I-N-G!!!

1/(Wish)
That Borderlands + it's DLC's, just as they are (don't forget to include the Scythid as an enemy stat to kill this time), be re-made/transferred into the Borderlands 2 Engine. Doesn't even have to have Cult Of The Vault symbols to find (nice touch if they did tho), but change the Weapons Proficiency into the Badass Ranking system, which is pretty much the same thing in increasing the weapon stats but with the Badass Ranking system you can also increase health and shields, grenades, melee, elemental and critical hit damage ... it's a better way of doing it. And while I'm wishing, now that all three games use a Badass Ranking system, why not make your Badass Ranking carry over into the next game ie, Borderlands -> Borderlands 2 -> The Pre-Sequel, now that would be cool.

The three games as a whole (this includes all mission based DLC's available) will keep you shooting, looting & hunting for challenges/achievements/symbols for a very long time. (Oh, and lets not forget laughing)"

Published in 2009, this game belongs in the [b]""lifetime"" category[/b], being always replayable no matter the advance on technology. People will come back for this game. Not necessarily for its [b]geeky, retro, cartoony graphics[/b] (which can be a downside for some gamers), but rather for its never-ceasing ability to [b]incite laughter and challenge[/b] at the same time.

It runs on a [b]modified Unreal Engine 3[/b]. While they indeed implemented cartoony graphics instead of polished ""realistic"" graphics, this approach allowed the developers to highly detail the surroundings in a way no other devs managed to pull off before using cartoony graphics.
The general atmosphere of the game could be defined as a mixture between Fallout, Diablo and dozen of other FPS / RPG's.

Critics and reviewers rarely give this game a lower score than [b]80/100 and with good reasons[/b].

If I had to critize something concerning Borderlands, I'd probably point at the considerable [b]weak AI[/b] and the rather [b]weak storyline[/b].

6049,Love this game
6050,"One of those games that provides random loot, including randomly generated weapons, shields and other goodies. The first missions are kind of back and forth, but stick with it and it gets good...real good!

You will waste a lot of hours on this. You will play ""just one more mission"" until the sun rises...again. You will promise yourself that you wont do that this time, knowing full well it is likely."
6051,"The first in a line of FPSRPGs that I fell in love with when I first picked up Borderlands 2 on the PS3. So I went back to the roots and picked up this game, which was my companion for while I was out on leave after my shoulder surgery. My favorite classes are the Soldier and the Siren, and when I feel like busting heads, I'll pick the berserker. So many guns, so many ways to play, you'll love every second of this game."
6052,"Was a good game overall, ending was a bit underwhelming, but for the rest was it a great game. I played it with my bro and we had a splendid time!"
6053,"Loved the game, though I can understand how it might not be for everyone. It is a great mix of fps and rpg. Most people keep playing it because they want to keep finding rare guns. 9/10 you need to try it!"
6054,it looks weird
6055,fun game like fallout but better
6056,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this game in the hopes of bridging the gap to the release of Mass Effect Andromeda in March 2017. Borderlands was advertised as similarly addictive as the Diablo series, so I thought ""Hey, why the hell not?"" 
Well, it didn't deliver. Really, it didn't. Perhaps I'm playing it wrong (which I'd find surprising since I more or less breezed through it without any trouble worth mentioning), but as far as the single player campaign is concerned, it was a staggering waste of money. To elaborate:
- The ""story"" - if you even want to call it such - is a paper-thin excuse plot at best, nonexistent at worst. 
- The enemy AI is dumb as brick, and since there's no such thing as difficulty adjustments, you can't even do anything about it. Just watch them either stand around in the open waiting to get shot, or charging straight at you waiting to get shot. No challenge here whatsoever.
- The quests are awfully repetitive, all of them: Go there (with ""there"" being a location you often just came from), kill/fetch some stuff, come back. Rinse and repeat. Sure, most RPGs run on this routine, but they usually have the decency to supplement it with some variety or background. Borderland is not one of them.
- The Fast-Travel System is a bad joke. It doesn't become available until the second act of the ""story"" and there's most often exactly one access point per dungeon, which means one thing: Backtracking. Lots and lots and lots of incredibly boring backtracking through the entire dungeon. Again and again. Half the game seems to consist of running through empty levels. In the rare cases fast-travelling is a valid option, have fun trying to find the FT spot you need for the location you want to visit; the menu is a catastrophe with less useful information than any tabloid.
- Another insanely repetitive facet: The things your enemies and especially the vending machines have to say. Having to listen to the same half-dozen lines over and over again without a means to skip or silence them had me on the verge of throwing my speakers out the window within the first hour of gameplay. It didn't get better afterwards. At all.
- The bosses. Oh boy, the bosses. Sure, they're big and all (most of them at least), and they're somewhat tougher and deal more damage than the average mook, but that's about it. No special tactics, no special abilities I noticed, no strategies required to beat them. Just keep shooting in their rough direction until either the boss or you bites the dust (usually the boss, since none of them is particularly challenging. Some are even outright jokes).
- Last but not least, if not worst of all: The loot system, considering the 87 bazillion guns available are the game's primary selling point. The randomized loot system isn't much different from Diablo's or similar franchises, granted. Still, it utterly failed to capture me just like the rest of the game. I can't put my finger on exactly why that is the case. Something's just... missing. Don't ask me what, I don't know, but it sucked.

To say at least something positive about Borderlands:
- It has a nice, dark sense of humor.
- The character classes, their abilities and the surprisingly useful NG+ features appear well-made, although not to the point that I feel any urge to continue playing after my first completed run and a brief peek into NG+.
- I heard/read about the DLCs being fairly decent and entertaining, but alas, the base game did far too good a job at pissing me off for me to give them a try.

I can't say anything about multiplayer since I am and have always been hardcore singleplayer, so go figure.

Bottom line: If you (like me) expect something on the level of DIablo, with guns, IN SPACE!, you're about to be sorely disappointed. Better spend that money elsewhere."
6057,"This game is ubelievable. Whilst a few years old, it is still a great game. The graphics aren't bad and framerates are pretty good too. Oh, and there is a heck of a lot of shooting and guns. Which is why it is so enjoyable. (I got the game and the 4 DLCs for £4.99 in the sale)"
6058,"[h1] BORDERLANDS [/h1]

[b]BORDERLANDS is one of my all time favourite games![/b]
I played it over and over again back on console and was really happy to see it as a steam release.
The best combination of shooter and rpg elements availiable.
The artstyle is hilarious and absolute unique, the shoot'n'loot gameplay keeps you motivated to explore every secret of pandora.

What a game, what a trip - a brilliant brutal modern classic!"
6059,"Played game while ago when it was released for the first time.......saw the sale on steam i had to finish it one more.
Borderlands is rich world full of caracters and items that make this game fun ride its compeling story is enough to hook you up and make you play it for hours upon hours.You will be interested whats behind next map location.
Fun game and best and most mysterious in series 10/10
"
6060,"Wonderful game. With over 91 hours + the hours I spent on 360, it was all well worth it. Some of the controls are rough, you may need to tweek the settings just a little bit, but once you do, absolutely phenominal. At times it does seem to be just running around, or empty in a lot of places, however I use it as a way to role play in the game."
6061,I can not believe it took me this long to get into this franchise! if you like shooter/looter games this is for you. Fantastic fun! The game is beautiful and that's considering its several years old now. It has held up superbly. Please give it a try if you haven't as I am sure you will fall in love as I have.
6062,"I love the game. Very nostalgic. As a Hunter, sniping is the highlight of the game to me. Scoring a critical hit is a satisfaction, thanks to the amazing design and graphics of the game. I have spent countless hours here. I would recommend it to a friend."
6063,"Honestly, I wish I could give a more neutral recommendation for this game.
It's not bad, but it's not terribly amazing. Overall, I'd recommend buying it while it's on sale.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*]Great humor
[*]Fun visuals and aesthetics
[*]Multiplayer makes it much more challenging and fun
[*]Boss fights are well-constructed and feel unique
[*]Creative universe feels immersive
[*]Quick travel system/buggy makes huge maps very convenient to traverse
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*]Music gets [b]REALLY[/b] old [b]REALLY[/b] fast
[*]Combat becomes bland and repetitive once you find your strategic niche
[*]Once you hit a certain level, nothing is really challenging anymore (I hit this level long before I finished the main campaign)
[*]Weapon damage statistics are very confusing once elemental damage gets involved (I had to look up the details online before I figured out how fire/poison/etc affected weapon damage)
[*][spoiler]Sudden, kind of anticlimactic ending[/spoiler]
[*]Not enough exposition of the universe it takes place in (personal opinion; I'm sure others would disagree with me on this)
[*]Some jokes/lines get repeated too often (mostly from Claptrap)
[*]In-game multiplayer chat is spotty; I'd recommend using Steamchat, Discord or some other form of communication
[/list]

I played through it with a friend, and that honestly was what kept me playing until the end. Multiplayer adds an element of longevity to the campaign that the single-player lacked on its own. I realize a lot of people love this game, so take my opinion with a grain of salt; I have very high standards when it comes to RPGs!"
6064,*opens loot chest* *gets attacked by a midget in a wrestler outfit* 10/10
6065,"Poor FOV is killing it all.
Or, poor QA/Dev time allocation.
Field of View has been hardcapped, apparently for a console in the engine somewhere and it is not possible to change it otherwise than by binding to a hotkey for PC use.
For a game that is being still sold, it wouldn't be difficult to add one more option to adjust the FOV setting, really."
6066,"Best co-p game next to the second one grab a friend(s) and enjoy this beast, awesome game.
The gore, loot, quests, guns, and pure bro-ness is just such a good mix.

6067,coolio
6068,Great diablo like game except from a FPS perspective and guns.  Minimal story.  Very addicting.
6069,"A fun game to play with friends, and interesting enough to play on your own.  The random gun generation is sometimes fun and sometimes lame, and the ending is severely disappointing, but the gunplay is solid.  Having to loot after battle kills the pacing, but some people play it for the looting.

Overall I like it."
6070,"the game that started it all. though several aspects were improved on in 2 (mini map and pace for sure, among others), this game still holds up and I love going back and playing it now and again. story is amazing and the characters are all very fun to play."
6071,i dont like borderland pretty sure someone gifted this to me i dont know why hte black lines everywhere it really sucks
6072,It's awsome
6073,Best game ever <3 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
6074,its good
6075,"The game is well designed  , its looks like a cartoon. it has nice chars, weapons, enemies and all that stuff
But claptrap is a pain in the ..... it talk too much.. its like a wheatley but more annoy. 

But the game crashed and i need to start all the missions again. GG 11/10 (I'm a lv 37 Siren)"
6076,"As of this writing, I'm clocked at 55 hours: all aiming.

I think that number is low because I could have sworn I clocked up a ton of hours back when it first released, and with good reason. It's a decent little shooter (a bit heavy on mob spawns for me as I prefer solo play) with beautiful art that fools don't appreciate--and it has tons of crazy guns.

What compelled me to write this review, was a moment I had last night, getting back into the series. I was shooting a bandit. First, you should know that loot drops in this game--as in, it just drops. No searching through enemy backpacks, just pick it up off the ground.

I shot a bandit, and to my surprise, loot flew from his lower anterior region. I was surprised, partly because usualy that doesn't happen until they're dead. With it happening and leaving the soon to be more properly dead bandit standing, but dazed, I said aloud (because observations like this must be said aloud even if you're alone) ""Holy crap. I just shot the shit out of that guy. Literally!""

Moments like that are the reason we even have the phrase ""shot the shit out of him"".

Buy Borderlands. Shoot the shit out of people. Literally. Then pick it up and sell it."
6077,BRAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNSSSSSSSSSSSS 10/10 DLC at the end
6078,"There are already plenty of brilliant reviews for this game. I just want to add a very simple ""thumbs DOWN"" and recommendation to AVOID here as well. This is not a terrible game. Maybe it just didn't live up to expectations. I expected an interesting story, not just an open world to run around shooting things. The writing (quests, dialogue, etc) seemed quite shallow and left me bored, with no compelling reason to continue exploring or completing the mundane tasks available. Not impressed. My rating for BORDERLANDS: 5 out of 10."
6079,"Killed a monster,found money & bullets in his chest.
11/10 
Would dig in corpses again."
6080,"Funnny...l missed this when it first came out. Don't know how but l guess l was busy and other games that took my interest. Many years on and l freakin love this game and the 'hook' it has. l am an old school Diablo player and the grinding to level up is awesome and it has humour. If it was not funny l would not play this. Games are meant to not take themselves to seriously. Anyway l have all the Borderslands, 2 and the prequel but l want to beat this one first. Tales of the Borderlands by Telltale is also an awesome game and 'Scooter' is in it. Love the lore and the style. Graphics on my nividia970 are maxed out and runs so smooth with an xbox controller even though it has no support for it. Great game. l recommend play this one first if you are new to the series. Even though this is a great game it might not suit to everyones FPS style. If you like the Diablo mechanic you will love this but if you love the COD corridor movie production you might not enjoy this. I enjoy both but Borderland has the hook and charcters that l will remember years from now. "

10/10"
6084,Most boring game ever!
6085,pretty good game
6086,"The (prequel) to Borderlands 2. The game is pretty boring, but sets up BL2."
6087," It's a solid game. 
The story isn't anything special: you're looking for the Vault, like some other people. On your way you kill a lot of enemies, like bandits. That's basically it.
 The mechanics are satisfying and easy. The shooting is good. The loot is pretty nice and has actually a lot of variaty. The skill system isn't that interesting. It just gives you more health, you do more damage. Some upgrades are pretty neat, for example the special move upgrades, but these are unlocked after a long time. The enemies do miss some variaty. There are some pretty great ones and pretty creative too, but it feels like they use the same enemies to much.
 The multiple caracters you can choose and the different ways they play and the ways you can play the game, makes for a pretty replayable game.
 The game still looks good. Didn't have any performance issues either.

The DLC really tries to pander out the gameplay: it takes way too long to get to some parts and it's repetetive. It just tries to make the game longer, but the gameplay and the enjoyment suffer under it."
6088,"Very fun. Although this game is fun to play in singleplayer, where it really shines is in the multiplayer. vehicles have 2 seats and you're able to trade weapons, revive eachother, and beat bosses together. 10/10 would run out of ammo in 3 seconds again."
6089,"One of the best games I've ever played. Co-op + your best playlist in spotify are a must.

Also, get b2 & pre-sequel."

6096,Best game ever. Holds up to modern standards.

6101,"I've been waiting to play this game for 5 years... And when I finally get to play it, I can't save it. I've set the file permission to owner and I've tried reinstalling the game, it didn't help. Still, I've put over 20 hours into this game and I would reccomend it to everyone"
6102,its goood

Fun to play with other players."
6104,gearbox nailed the atmosphere in this post apocalyptic action drop in co-op survival arcade fpsrpg wasteland survival game in which you can play a class that allows you to kill things by punching them with your oversized literally explosive fists. 10/10
6105,"This game was a lot of fun on the consoles, but this version does not seem to work at all for multiplayer.  Tried to play it for a while but the connection issues were constant and when it worked, the lag was so extreme it was unplayable.  I play a lot of other multiplayer games with the same people over the same connections, but for some reason this one was just a mess.  I guess you could play it singleplayer, but I can't see myself playing this game alone when I could just play Fallout.  Co-op is the whole draw, and it doesn't seem to work."
6106,Borderlands? More like sitting on the border of your chair trying to finish all the missions and staying with the story whilst scavenging creatures that brutally raped you and your fourth ancestors in some unknown lands.
6107,"The game is good but it does have its issues. 

When thinking about the gameplay the weapon handling feels clunky, but it feel that its actually a good thing, its feels like you really have to control them rather than just point and shoot.

The story and world is really interesting, whether it be the main game or the expansions. 
However the gameplay never really changes, and is very hard to keep you interested.

Its worth giving a go, but if you have yet to play a Borderlands game I would say that 2 is a better place to start."
6108,Great game. I love the story!!!!
6109,Damn good game
6110,Gud :D
6111,Pal its a good game if your buddy told you to buy it buy it and get some guns do some crap and have some fun for fnck sake because that's the hole point of a god damn game mate

6122,"I currently own this game for every console, and would gladly fork over more money for it. The original Borderlands adds a great rpg aspect to the fps genre, and in my opinion does so perfectly. If you like rpgs, dabble in the fps realm, and love spotting references to 70's, 80's, and 90's pop culture, you'll definitely enjoy your time here. I highly recommend getting the GOTY edition, as you'll have roughly twice the content."

6128,"A great game with funny jokes and a fun story

fps mechanics feel great"
6129,Originally played this game on ps3 and thought it was amazing but recently brought it again to play on my laptop and honestly the game still feels so good despite me not being able to control my character well yet.
6130,This game is still fun aprox 7 years later. I played this on XBOX 360 and loved it now I have made the swap on PC there is nothing I love more than the increased performance and the nostalgia in replaying this great game.

6132,hehe xd
6133,"This game has extreme replayability for its type, hours of fun. I may not have much on steam, but I probably had over 500+ hours on my old xbox 360. Can be a bit challenging for a new player to grasp some of the mechanics in the game but from then on it's smooth sailing. The game id sort of a mix between an FPS with some roleplay. You kinda have to play it to get the jist of it.

[*]Lots of replayability
[*]Very involved in the game, no just passing it off as another ""FPS"" 
[*]Well thought out art style, fits the game very nicely
[*]Fun characters with different personalities and traits

6136,"This game features a forgettable story, terrible humor, cringy writing and Claptrap - the most annoying pseudo-cute robot ever invented. Still, the game is fun if you like to grind rare items in an obsessive stupor for hours without end. I strongly recommend to turn the character voices off and to ignore the story."
6137,One of my favorite games of all time.  Have way more hours on 360 but playing over again on PC.  I don't even play with people despite how much more fun it is.  This game is incredible.  Buy it.  Buy this game.  Pay money for this game and play it.  Yes.
6138,"I have mixed experience from this game, cause from the one hand it was really fun but from the other very redundant. To sum up:
+ humor
+ multiplayer
+ classes
+ leveling system
+ many different weapons 
+ open world with many quests and enemies
- unfortunatelly quest and enemies are very repeatable
- side quest are often long and boring (grab the item here, bring it there, collect your reward over there)"
6139,love this game still good after lots of years of play time.
6140,"Why is this game so hyped!?!! Quests are go to x and kill x and the story is super boring!
Its just a simple shooter nothing special about."
6141,"Diablo meets Doom.
Funny story.
Would buy again during sale."
6142,"Very good, first one of the franchise, I really liked the characters, the sense of humour and the story throughout the game."
6143,"I can't push through this game anymore. 70 fov that has to be modded out, unfunny ""jokes,"" almost no voice acting, unending MMORPG style boring quests, accuracy stat that defeats the purpose of a scope, fuckloads of shitty loot, and practically no story. The only positive is the art style. Maybe it's fun with friends, but so is anything else."
6144,"[h1] Does it have a premise? [/h1]

As the Vault Hunters, you (and your friends) are looking for The Vault, a place that opens every 200 years, which, according to rumours, houses treasures not of this world. While it is a Pandoran legend, that's not going to stop you.

[h1] How does it play? [/h1]

Borderlands is an open-world looter shooter with RPG elements. The enemies are usually bullet sponges, and while I'm of the philosophy that bullets shouldn't respect how far in the game you are, it's unavoidable. Weapons and other items are color-coded by rarity, and generally, by their overall quality. It goes as follows: White >> Green >> Blue >> Purple >> Orange, white being the most common, orange being the rarest. On another note entirely, vehicles drive like total ass. Fin.

You can choose one of four characters, each boasting a unique set of skills and a specific role in a well-balanced team. 

Roland - the Soldier has a sentry turret which he can deploy, which, with some upgrades allows it to heal and replenish ammunition of teammates, filling a defensive and supportive role. The character is suited to shotguns and combat rifles.

Lilith - the Siren can phase out of reality as we perceive it, turning invisible to enemies and moving far faster than normal. With this, Lilith's elemental proficiency and her damage and crit skills in mind, the class is well-suited for a hit and run DPS role. The character is suited to SMGs and repeater pistols, preferably with the capability for elemental damage.

Mordecai - the Hunter can use his pet, Bloodwing to swoop in and attack enemies, dealing massive damage and negating cover. With his skills geared towards sniping and long-range combat, he fills in the much needed long-range role. The character is suited to revolvers and sniper rifles.

Brick - the Beserker can do just that, berserk his enemies, beating them into piles of bloody goop with his fists. His skills are geared towards tanking damage, kicking ass and taking names. The character is suited to explosives and melee combat.

[h1] Does it have music? [/h1]

The music is there, however, it's woefully average. There are a handful of memorable pieces, but it's mostly ambience and generic combat music.

[h1] How is the port? [/h1]

This is a new addition to my typical reviews, but I've ought to mention this, the game is locked at a 55 degree field of view, which can understandably be troublesome for a lot of players. This can be remedied with some .ini tweaking which I won't go into detail with in this review, but that doesn't smoothly fix the issue. The game's determined to have the FOV at 55. However, the performance is solid, which is a given since the game is approaching eight years of age.

[h1] Who should buy this? [/h1]

If you enjoy RPGs, open worlds, shooting or looting, then this game is for you. While its sequel, Borderlands 2, overshadows it in every regard, I can't help but carry a certain degree of nostalgia towards the original. I have to say, that in my opinion, this is one of the finest looter shooters around, which isn't surprising when you consider that the market isn't crowded."
6145,Badasses in this game are really badasses
6146,"Hands down, the best Borderlands game out there,"
6147,.
6148,Best GAME ever!!!!
6149,"I'm a huge fan of stealth games, and constantly complain about broken, op stealth mechanics in games like Skyrim. My friends kept telling me to play Borderlands, and they were totally right. Lillith has a great stealth tree, and while Mordacai doesn't really have a stealth tree, that opens up a whole new challenge: good luck trying to do stealth in the desert!"
6150,"I can't believe i am just now discovering how fun this game is.  There are a ton of quests to do and the weapons and gear keep getting cooler and cooler as I progress.  It is a Fun game in a Mad Max type universe where you don't have to be a hero.  I love the concept of just being a guy who wants treasure and i'm helping people because they will help me get the treasure.  it's a cool change up from the I'm special and I'm a hero who is such a boyscout that I always do the right thing.  Most RPG games that I have played have the boyscout theme, and I'm not saying I don't like being a hero, but this is a cool change.  We don't have to be the light blessed good guy all the time.  It's kinda neat to just be a dude tryin to get by, or tryin to get cool loot."
6151,"exactly like like borderlands , but it will make you feel cold and empy inside."
6152,One of the best games of my childhood. 10/10!
6153,"A great game to play through with friends, but if playing solo then it gets repetitive quite quickly. Storyline doesnt do much to engage you, as it tries to stay impersonal to the character you chose. DLC is a must, as it provides the best gameplay segments and the better equipment. All in all, good if you playing with friends, samey if you playing alone."
6154,"Hell of a fun game! The original before number 2 came out, can't not recommend this game."
6155,it's was slow in the beggining play with friends and itll be a blast but overall for its time its great
6156,"As far as FPS games go, this series has the most character and insane story line. I really have enjoyed this game. Look forward to putting way more hours in!! <3 <3"
6157,"Fun game, I love how I can run around and pretend I'm actually there! To bad the AI are quite bad, all-in-all, great game!"
6158,"Borderlands - The Game
Starring:
Roland..........Soldier
Mordekai.......Sniper
Liltih.............Sirene
Brick............Himself

laughed my as* off"
6159,БЛЯ ТОП
6160,"Been years since I played the original Borderlands. I remember thinking it was pretty revolutionary at the time. FPS with RPG leveling and loot system? Heck yeah! Sign me up! And that is why I am finally getting around to leaving it a positive review. Not going to debate if the sequel is better or not since I never finished Borderlands 2. I'll just say that the original game was fun at the time of release and may/may not be as fun now, but it's dirt cheap so give it a try....maybe."
6161," After all these years, still a solid co-op experience."
6162,AWESOME !!!
6163,"Meeeeeeh... rediculously overrated buuuut worth a go, kind of bland and borring and the loot system is screwy, getting level 2 items from level 20 enemies lol stupid, story moves very slow and practically not there except for some lady that pops up and says a sentence or two once in a while. gonna finish the game just to see if the sedonc and the third one are anybetter, only recomend because of the crazy ass 75% off sale"
6164,"This game has aged like yogurt on hot pavement and if you're looking to get into the series, please just got Borderlands 2 GOTY. If you already played Borderlands 2 and you want the extra lore, there is non outside the crimson lance dlc, so please just watch a playthrough summary of that instead of making yourself suffer through this awful experience. Also this game's Roland VA eats stanky garbage."
6165,"Incredible game

10/10"
6166,"I originally played this on the ps3. I must have racked up at least 200 hours on it. Get this game, with the expansions
 You will not regret it. The art, humour, gameplay make it unique and addictive. The only knock on the PC version is no split screen co-op..Old school I know but it was a blast playing this on the couch my my brother."
6167,"It takes place in 2020, Donald trump has finally built the great big beautiful wall at the end of his presidency- capable of detering and stopping any illegal immigrants from crossing the border into our country, you play as 1 of 4 illigal immigrants trying to find the ""vault"", which is the door into america, and only opens every 4 years when a new president is being elected, and you must fight your way through border patrol, cops, other wannabe immigrants, mexican dogs, birds, and bugs, aswell as a few wellfair bosses in order to find the vault, and steal america's jobs!"
6168,Masterpiece!
6169,"Experience Pandora before Gearbox started throwing at you EXPLOSIONs, MEMEs and MORE ANNOYING ROBOTS. Slightly less fun, occasionally boring, more linear and with more grinding, just what people want today. Still enjoyable with the right company.

Daddy Crawmerax > any other boss in the franchise."
6170,"Game is ""kinda"" cool but nah"
6171,"Actually, the game is quite good!
Nice graphics.
Simple story: Go out, kill, collect new weapons.

But the following just annoyed me and made it unplayable / not enjoable at all for me:
Enter a new map. 
Make your way through it or just partially.
(Achieve your mission goal, get close to death and make your way back to get some medkits or get killed)
In most of the times all the enemies you just killed a few minutes ago are back again!

It might work if the map is big, then it would not feel empty - but still, all are back after some minutes (?).
The breaking point for me was in Sledge´s bunker or whatever complex it was. I made my way through it, was close to death so i ran back - maybe 300m ingame - to get myself some medkits. And all the enemies i killed just 5 minutes ago were back???

Same like in the S.t.a.l.k.e.r game - ruined it for me the same way.

If you are into stuff like that, get the game, its good!
But its definitely nothing for me, unfortunately.."
6172,This is good.
6173,It's as if CoD4 had a child but no one's quite sure whether the father is Skyrim or Fallout 3.
6174,"To be honest....
Perfect 
<3"
6175,"Best!
playing it in 2017 new year!"
6176,"If you've never played Borderlands 2 and want to play this for the story or just to expeirence the series origins, definitely play this first because the second game blows it out of the water and you won't be able to come back to this and have as much fun as you once did.

It's a decent game and had a lot of promise which they fully flushed out in #2 and it's worth a playthrough or two."
6177,"A bit of a grind depending on how you play, but an overall incredible game."
6178,"Like Fallout 4 but feel like it's ""meh"" due to it using Skyrim's engine/ just being boring at times? Have you played Destiny but absolutely hated its looting system engrams and want a better version of its loot system? Do you like goofy over the top jokes with crazy characters? This game is for you! Well... maybe. Borderlands is a great game and it takes time to get through, it doesn't feel like a game I could take bite sizes of and play here and there, it feels like a sit down and play whole title. This game leans heavily on its writing and characters, and without them, it would have utterly failed imo. This was a single player play through, so this is a review written by a lone experience. Here's some pros 'n cons!

Pros:
- Interesting cast of characters that are rememberable and unique.
- The game will break the 4th wall but tastely and not rip you from the immersion. Great writing, and plenty of jokes that will actually make you laugh out loud, no lie. LOL
- Looting weapons is great and it's nice to find some badass epic or legendary weapons not given by bosses.
- Unique skill tree building will allow you to build your unique vault hunter the way you want to play them.
- Does a great job making sure you feel like you're in a trashed planet with a bunch of scum bag bandits who can't write nor barely speak proper English. 
- Fun unique DLC that came w/ the bundle I got was fun and fairly more entertaining than the original game.

Cons:
- Long treks back 'n forth from quest boards to waypoints on the map.
- Game is not fully optimized for controller support. All interactions will specify pc UI/button usage, and unless you've figured out the buttons and usage through the menu, you'll have a bad time. 
- This same Wasteland is nice, but also bad? It would have been nice for a change of scenery to be honest. Most of the game makes you feel like you're stuck wading through trash piles and barren, lifeless and dry/dead plains just to hope that the quest you've been treking across the map to get to will be fun and exciting.
- by the 3rd quarter of the game weapons are unique in nature and have some cool effects, but the weapons you may have looted hours upon hours back are better than legendary loot? Kind of makes it feel like you're stuck with the same  ♥♥♥♥ for the rest of the game's experience. (Even the DLC)
- Claptrap never SHUTS THE  ♥♥♥♥ UP ABOUT HAVING NEW QUESTS AT QUEST BOARDS OR PERSONNEL! More than half of these extra tagged on quests are lame, agrivating, and annoying to do. Mainly the ones where you have to build weapons from scattered parts only to cash the quest and get a  ♥♥♥♥   ♥♥♥ gun you'll vendor 2 minutes after cashing.
- Menu for quests sucks in its organization and is hard to use since it doesn't work hand in hand with your map to figure out where you have to go. 
- No mini map.
- Vehicle gets stuck one every little  ♥♥♥♥ing rock you accidently run over (or guard rail) and you are forced to get out, blow that stupid  ♥♥♥♥ing piece of  ♥♥♥♥ up and run your  ♥♥♥ the rest of the GOD DAMN WAY TO THE QUEST MARKER. UGH.

Anyways, yes, this review had many faults to pros, but I honestly enjoyed this game. I'm currently still playing some of the DLC before continuing my venture in BL2 which imo is far better than the first in almost every way. If you start w/ BL2 I don't blame you, the first can seem boring, but not uninspired. The game lacks much, but if you play the second, trust me, you'll love the characters so much you'll want to play homage to the first game. On a scale one 1- 10, I'd give this sucker a 7/10. Good game, even great at times, but not without its set of issues. Good luck out there Future Vault Hunter! :D"
6179,Childhood complete. Buy it.
6180,What are you doing down here get the game already!

6182,is good yas
6183,One of the best games ;)
6184,"Me after playing for hours: Okay, so when does this get more interesting?
Game: What do you mean by „interesting”?
Me: You know, story or something.
Game: Find the vault. 
Me: Okay, but tell me more about it.
Game: Calm down, look at all these enemies to kill!
Me: But it’s boring.
Game: Why? You have like thousands of guns, bro, have fun!
Me: But these are always the same quests and they are the same enemies in the same areas. They are always bandits, psychos or the dog things, and maybe sometimes those weird birds. 
Game: Look at these then!
Me: Those are just more dog things, but bigger ones. 
Game: Well, have fun with hundreds of them.
Years later.
Game: Here’s the vault.
Me: That’s it? That was this whole thing about?!
Game: Hope you had your fun, thanks for your money!

I’m sure there are people who enjoy this game, but not me, since I pretty much felt like I was running around in a garbage can with hundreds of guns while shooting everything that moves.
There's no actual story, the characters didn’t have any personalities at all. They were only there to give quests, but nothing else, you can’t actually speak with anyone, so it felt so deserted. I hoped that it will at least be funny, not no. Whoever thought Claptrap will be a good idea, ’cause he is funny: he is not. He was nothing, but really annoying. Every time I was near him, he said something like ’Look at me everyone, I’m dancing, I’m dancing.’ That. Is. Not. Funny. 
I don’t think it’s a horrible game, it was simply not made for me, because I don’t find fun in mindless shooting without a normal story. Also the ending was one of the most disappointing things ever."
6185,"It is a good game,

when they add splitscreen coop like in the console versions i will truly recomend it

enough of this ""no splitscreen on pc"" bullshit"
6186,"WOW! WHAT AN EXPERIENCE!! Im a mentally retarded cripple born in the 1935 so i really enjoyed the sensation i got from over 8 hours of running around talking to others for minimal experience to proceed into some guys with steel fucking skin and some badass fire slugs with torpedo acid that never misses no matter how much i fucking serpentine. Im wondering if in the office when developing this game, they were under the influence of the slogan ""fuck it."" fuck you and fuck off 10/10 dont fucking talk to me"
6187,"It's been years since I first played this game, I just recently rebought it for PC.
My little brother bonded over this game more than when we played Super Mario Smash Bros.
From guns and gore, to silly jokes between characters, I have to say this is a great game with tons of replay value. (especially after you beat the game the first time.)
My favorite build was Lillith the Siren with main weapons being the Elephant Gun, and a gnarly assault rifle (no scopes) and the left skill tree (can't remember the name of it), focusing on skill cooldown timers and dazing abilities.
I phase out, thus dealing heavy damage in an AOE, and pop back into a group of enemies, thus dealing even more AOE damage, and I usually had either a sniper backup, or a teammate closeby to deal damage while I distracted the AI.

[list][u]Pros[/u]:
[*]You get to decide your own perks, depending on whick play style you are in the mood for. Even dual building trees is doable. (There is an option to reset your perks and get back all your points to rechoose your skills if you ever feel like you spent them in the wrong places, or if you are playing with a new team build of characters.)
[*]Tons of different weapons to choose from, also gives you all the stats to each weapon, so that you don't have to playtest every gun, (since you'll be in combat 24/7 if you're playing with other players).
[*]Enemies switch up and get more interesting to fight against the farther you go on (it gets really exciting around level 20).
[*]Non-Playable Character's aren't near as dull as most First Person Shooter's or Role Play Games are. Giving the game much more depth. The NPC's make them seem much more fleshed out than other game's. This is why this game stuck out to me the most when I was younger.[/list]

[u]Cons[/u]:
[list][*]Although I loved the variety of guns, I was always switching up weapons every few levels or so. You get a gun you're really in love with, good damage, good fire rate/clip size, etc, and an hour or 3 later, the gun doesn't do enough damage to the enemies bc they are too high a level now, and then you have to find a higher level weapon that has similar stats, and you sometimes have to settle for guns that might not suit your play style, just to get to where you can take out enemies without using 2 whole clips, until you can get the weapon you REALLY wanted all along.
[*]When a player joins your game, and they're a higher level than you (ex: you're level 5 and a new player comes in at level 12), the game will upscale the difficulty on the enemies you find throughout the game, so that the higher level player doesn't breeze through the game too easily. This however makes it very difficult on the lower level player. [b]SIMPLE FIX THOUGH[/b]: kick people who are too high a level if you're the host, or leave.
[*]Loot Boxes and Loot - Typically, if you aren't the first to the loot box, and your're playing with a stingy player, they'll pick up either all the loot for themselves either to sell or to use later. And you don't get much... kinda like [i]first come, first serve[/i]. I don't mind it that much, because I'm typically the first to the loot boxes, and I try to take one item and let the rest fight over what's left. BUT, I can see why other people like playing solo rather than depending on a group.[/list]


Not a con, just a complaint, [spoiler]I hate when I'm dying and I'm about to get 2nd wind so that I don't die AND SOMEONE ELSE KILLS THE ENEMY I AM ABOUT TO KILL. If they just let me kill them, I wouldn't need you to heal me. I'D ALREADY BE UP AND ONTO THE NEXT TARGET.[/spoiler] Just saying, this is the only reason my brother and I fought during this game. [spoiler] I would go ""I'm dying, let me kill this guy so that I can get back up."" And he'd kill them and have to rush to me before I respawned. And majority of the time, he wouldnt get to me in time....[/spoiler]"
6188,"If you want to play an isolated game with a smile on your face the whole time, get this game. I don't care what anyone says this game is the best in it's franchise with the corny jokes, isolated feel and my favorite OST. The game starts you off in a town called firestone where you can pick your character, Brick the buff ass dude, Lilith the siren, Mordecai the sniper and Roland the rifler, you're after a treasure called ""the vault"" and it's told to have great treasures within it, definitely recommend playing this before the telltale series or any others
"
6189,nice game !
6190,"Best loot experience ever. Awesome co-op, awesome enemies, awesome game. one of the few games I own on multiple platforms."
6191,Pretty good
6192,"I've been running this through wine - specifically playonlinux using 1.7.53-steam_crossoverhack.  It works well although the FPS is not great but definitely playable.  Increasing/decreasing graphics options does not change the FPS so you can max everything out without worrying about performance.  

The game itself is really fun.  I'm coming from BL2 and TPS so it is definitely a step backwards but remains a great game.  Like all the borderlands games it is built on loot and skills which are plentiful.  Really the most frustrating part is not have a mini-map which makes me keep opening up the map for directions.  

I really like the Borderlands universe and it is fun exploring this planet again.  The opening is set in Fyrestone which is also playable in BL2, only in BL2 it ceased to be an abandoned Dahl village and was instead turned into a post apocalyptic environmental disaster by Hyperion.  The game also gives insight to many of the characters you run into in the later games.

Overall, highly recommend it to Borderlands fans and if you are a Linux user it works fine with wine.  If you are new to Borderlands it is probably best to start with Borderlands 2."
6193,first 1.9 hrs record really badass game 11/10.
6194,"Borderlands is one of the most fun FPSs you can find - a true guilty pleasure. 
Welcome to Pandora, a planet with as many cartoonish characters as the entire cast of the looney toons, only here the violence has consequences - watch heads explode, set enemies on fire, and enjoy the general mayhem to be had in this ever-respawning world. Random weapons allow you to change your playstyle several times over and the fact that skill-trees are resetable allow you to enjoy a single playthrough with each character, not having to grind through game beginnings over and over - 9/10"
6195,"2 words,

washing machines."
6196,Pistol Mordecai is awesome
6197,Intresting but awesome graphics! game play and storys are well put together
6198,"If you were like me and was wondering if you should play Borderlands 1 before the rest of the franchise...
Yes, absolutely, yes. It's an amazing introduction to one of my favorite franchises ever. Trust me, you will not appreciate borderlands 2 nearly as you would if you played Borderlands 1, first. The world is so atmospheric with a clear inspiration from Mad Max.

Yes, it will take some patience as playing this game may seem almost depressing knowing that Borderlands 2 is available to you. But, yes, this game is definitley worth completing in order to get a true sense of the franchise."
6199,"COME ON CATCH-A-RIIIIIDE




get it."
6200,Extreme And Crazy
6201,"That game is very weird for weird people, my luck..i'm one of them . XD"
6202,"When a friend recommended and bought the game for me, I didn't think I would like it. I was wrong lol I loved it and my friend and I played it a lot. I do recommend it to anyone that likes shooter games. My son played it and he also loves it and will tell anyone how good it is. It has a lot of comedy and action, sometimes fast paced sometimes slow. I especially loved the robot Cl4ptrap, he made it so very fun to play. You meet interesting characters and you get to shoot creatures that for no better reason than you being in the area will hunt you."
6203,This game is the best coop game ive ever pla7yed
6204,I don't recomend playing this game alone. It is very borring. Get some friends and play it im MP.
6205,"Had a great time from start to finish.  Story was interesting but it did not fully capture as great.  Now that I finished the main story, I am starting Borderlands 2 which is equally awesome."
6206,good game
6207,"One of my all time favorite games! Played it when it first came out in 2009 on xbox 360, and decided to play it again on PC"
6208,"Played this game to death on 360. Now that im venturing into PC Gaming, I had to get this game as well."
6209,"played this after i finished borderlands 2, it was a bit tougher i think, but after the first walkthrough it was pleasant to play"
6210,Shoot people in the face.
6211,"Highly recommended, GOTY edition the best version available. 10/10 would suggest for anyone looking for a shoot n' loot style game
"
6212,"I love borderlands. I've lost count of how many times I've beaten this game. Grinded out the platinum trophy on my ps3 and got every last trophy there is on the steam version. Oh how I love to hate the moxxy DLC.

Guns, more guns, loot, diablo like loot, comedy, and loot. If you don't like this game, I don't like you."
6213,Do I really need gto say anything ?
6214,"Love this game, love this atmosphere.
For me: BL1=BL2=TPS"
6215,"Imagine a pile of BS stacked on another pile of BS, with a sniper rifle on top. That's this game. I love it."
6216,"Amazing game and some of the best DLC content ever produced in my personal opinion, I truly hope the next borderlands returns to this type of game."
6217,Definitely wait until this goes on sale to buy it + the 4 DLC that comes with it. It is an amazing game but it gets boring really quick without someone to play with.
6218,Very Fun game especially for the release date. Would recommend to people wanting to enjoy a story and quest game like World Of Warcraft. Lots of action packed quests. Very fun playing with someone you know.  Graphics seem differed but are able to be delt with.
6219,Played through it on every system i'ver had
6220,meh
6221,great game
6222,"This game man... damn. Wether it's on sale or not it's totally worth every penny you spend. The game is overloaded with content no buy a dlc to continute the story bullshit. Speaking of DLCs, the game of the year edition is also worth if you're looking to add more content to the already abundant vanilla copy. It's almost 8 years since it's release it is still one to beat. Optimization wise, this game runs buttery smooth nothing else to say. I highly recommend it to people who want to sit down and grind on an RPG without the hassle of looking for a guide online on how to finish it because it's that simple. Just keep shooting and it never gets old."
6223,Cool and Good.
6224,Can be more fun then borderlands 2 and the pre-sequel but get the it when it's on sale.
6225,"Easily one of the better FPS type games that I've played in recent years.  It is possible to play though the entire game as a single player, however I will say that the experience is definitely inferior when playing alone.  A single partner makes it much better, and a group of three or four better still, provided that everyone is available at the same time to play.

The biggest flaw in the game has to do with mission/quest tracking in multiplayer mode.  It's possible for players to join and find that they're unable to complete the quest the remainder of the group is working on.  The key seems to be to have the player who is the least far along in the story line host.

Fights between players are possible, although due to the skill trees a charachter set up to win fights against the baddies of Pandora in cooperation with their team may sometimes be completely helpless when one of those team members turns against them, while conversely, occasionally a charachter will be very good at easily and rapidly defeating their teammates.

Definitely recommended.  The DLC addons are not as strong as the main game, but still worth at least one playthrough."
6226,"Would reccomend the game, fantastic game for 2008. Even though the graphics aren't the best for 2017, I still enjoyed the game and the bosses and provides a great back story for BL2."
6227,"I know that when posting this at this point and time (12/26/16) that I've only played 0.4 hours of this, but I already finished playthrough 1 & 2 and the first DLC, and I can say that this is one of my favorite games of all time. Endless fun when you're playing by yourself or with friends (although friends make it better)"
6228,"Excellent game, theres just so much to do. Bought this one for multiple systems over time."
6229,"In short, this game is great and full of quest to keep you entertained. Bosses, secret weapons and things to find is a nice edition too. Example being the alien weapons. There are good number of different areas to explore, some ranging from deserts to mountain ranges, and forest. This game is a great and you should play the other Borderlands games also!"
6230,"Borderlands

An old but amazing game made in 2009 with

Good Graphics, Great Gameplay, A Great Story,
Leveling and Missions, Easter Eggs, Etc.

This Game Is Amazing 

It Has Been Since Release On Console
And Will Always Be. Even on pc it's amazing and just a perfect game.

20/10"
6231,"Loaded into this game and sat there for like ten minutes listening to bus driver, not because i needed to, but because i wanted to. The game has good humor and fun gameplay. 9/10. I did get this game on a very large sale. I paid ten dollars for the GOTY and borderlands 2."
6232,"A great way to introduce a world 
9/10"
6233,"Lilith has a very nice ass.

9/10 very fun game!!"
6234,Very good Game bruh
6235,"Great game by far my favourite borderlands, would recommend it over any of the other games, though ill admit borderlands 2 is pretty good . great bosses great guns great dlc fun achievements (even the underdome ones ;) ) story was fun and was an all round enjoyable game"
6236,"Borderlands can be played alone or as a co-op game with up to 4 people.
One of the main parts of the game is grinding levels and collecting better loot. weapons with better stats and so on in order to defeat enemies in the later game that are pretty much the same as in the beginning only with a higher ammount of health points and damage output.

Basicly it's a fun game if you want to play it with your friends, but I would not recommend it if you are looking into playing it as a singleplayer shooter.

In terms of technical aspects:
Even low end systems today should be able to handle the game just fine.
However it does lack a lot of the PC-Features such as a field of view slider and such. you'll have to download a external fix in order to increase the fov which is pretty narrow by default. Also the sensitivity slider doesn't go very far, so you may have to adjust the dpi of your mouse if you want to use a low sensitivity.
So if you care about PC-exclusive features, such as the before mentioned and don't care about the story (which doesn't seem like anything ground breaking to me so far), you may want to skip borderlands 1 entirely and go straight to borderlands 2, which does have such features as a FoV slider.

So do I reccomend it?
The answer is no, if you are looking for a singleplayer game.
And yes if you are looking for a co-op game to play with your friends and can get past its flaws I mentioned earlier.
"
6237,"This was one of the first serious games I´ve ever played and the first real shooter, and i have never regreted it. I love the setting, love characters, love the enemies, love the DLCs and love everything this game has. It´s a really good game and I totally recommend it if you´re are looking for a fun shooter in which you kill a lot. I laughed a lot playing this game, really entertaining both solo and co op.
The story is really good too, but it is kind off slow and it doesn´t progress that much, especially since the scripts are few and short. 
The only really bad thing about this game, is the final boss which is really dissapointing and not challenging at all. Previous bosses were better.
8/10"
6238,"Good game, brilliant graphics for the time this was released and really good online mode with many missions and weapons."
6239,"beautiful

6240,"alright lets see...

"
6243,"One of my all time favourite games, A solid 420/69 would play again"
6244,Good game with lots of crazy people to kill.
6245,"One of the better games of all time, I still love Mad Moxxis arena combat and the General Knox DLC. The game looks great at 4k as well."
6246,"I love this game, I love the cell shaded graphics and the ease of gameplay. The quests are interesting enough to not get bored out of my mind, the selection of guns is incredible and the cars are great fun!. I was never originally into the Borderlands games when they came out, glad I took another look!."
6247,"If you got Diablo, turned it into a FPS game and set it in the future, this would be it."
6248,big heart that says love youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
6249,"Not my favourite, that would be Borderlands 2 (for the series) however this game was tons of fun for myself and a friend."
6250,10/10
6251,"Great Coop game. Not as fun single player. The humor is great and gameplay is very enjoyable. The sequels are also good, probably better, but the story starts here and it's still worth your time."
6252,Recently played it co-op with my brother and have a marvelous time with it
6253,One of the best FPS games I've played. I enjoy playing it on every platform I have it for. The amount of item possibilities is amazing.
6254,"About 30 hours of fun, if you want too complete everything (DLC not included). Although i would recommend Borderlands 2, its mutch better then this part.

Borderlands in general:
The game offers one of the best co-op experience i've ever had. That the power of Borderlands. You can play the hole game in co-op mode. And it is a perfect balans between AL and player.

The grapics are strange at first, but after a short while you wont see difference anymore. And maybe it even starts too look nice. 

"
6255,"I played Borderlands 2 first, so this one wasn't quite as fun because most of the character dialogue is written and not spoken, but this is still a great game."
6256,"Amazing game, for some reason horrible PC crash issues that the other sequels didn't have.  Played it to death on Xbox.  
Great for it's time, but no comparison to the sequels."
6257,"It's the game that started it all, and the reason why Gearbox is still in business. Incredibly fun, addicting, and a joy to play. Friends or no friends, this game is excellent."
6258,"I caved in and bought the entire ""Take over your life"" bundle after a very limited experience (consisting of the first episode of TFTBL which was free on Google Play and [i]cool people are playing this game[/i]). Best decision I made this year."
6259,"The game has become a bit dated at this point but still a lot of fun. At the time of its release it was a very unique fps rpg. Though it is dated, for $5 on a steam sale this is a great deal! Just started a playthrough with a group from work!"
6260,loved this game from start to finish.
6261,"A good COOP experience with some good laughs, recommended!"
6262,THis gotta be one of my favorite games of all time that ive ever played.
6263,Nice game !
6264,"Played the whole campaign co-op. The best thing for me is how you keep on receiving better and better guns to blow stuff up.  

Can't wait to play part 2."
6265,I remember when this game firsr came out. The hours on steam are not accurate as ive owned the game since xbox 360 and picked it up on sale. But borderlands is probably still one of my favorite games of all time. Soo many memories and gameplay. The replay value for me is very high with this game. Lots and lots of guns.
6266,"One of the best shooters I have ever played. If you enjoy shooters you will love the approach to weapons in Borderlands. Wonderful colors, great sound effects and amazing recoil action.Weapons are randomly generated and very fun to manage.
If you also like RPGs, then you will really love this game.

If on top of all that you also play Fallout games, then just get Borderlands and thank me later."
6267,Please give me back my life.
6268,"This game is definately better than the second. As a person who doesn't like fps games, this is one of the best I've played. The story is completely ignorable, the quests offer quite the challenge, and the playable characters offer a playstyle for everyone. If you play multiplayer, only do it with friends. The difficulty increases with more people and if someone leaves, the difficulty stays the same, which can get annoying. Definately worth the price tag.

7/10 one of the best fps games out there"
6269,"Gearbox is 2greedy, boycotted"
6270,"Bad shooting, abysmal physics, terrible open world with a whole lot of nothing, generic quests, bad dialogue. Overall a bad experience."
6271,"Great humor, multiplayer is a little hard to come buy sadly but the game is fun. The music can get a little dull at some moments but the lore is great!"
6272,yes very good game with good story yes very good yes
6273,"This game was fun, but proved to be tedious. No matter what character I played or what friend I played it with, there was always a point in the middle of the game where it got incredibly hard and incredibly boring. Even the ending wasn't all that incredible. 

However, this game was creative, fresh, and well made. If you get stuck or mad, just push through. It's a worthwhile game, just not exactly a 10/10 game."
6274,"Was great for its time, but the gameplay mechanics have aged terribly.  You're not missing out on much compared to 2/3"
6275,"Fun, spent man hours playing it."
6276,Good.
6277,This is it. This is my story.
6278,10/10 thats all
6279,"Personally, as the first game in the series, Borderlands felt huge and very refreshing. the skill tree and loot systems are much more simple than in the sequel, making the game great for beginners. The only drawback that someone may experience with this game is if they've played Borderlands 2 before, which will make the first entry seem bland and slightly boring.

[u] Pros [/u]
[list]
[*] Simple and easy to understand RPG elements
[*] Sarcastic and Ironic humour
[*] The DLC feel like different stories, making them feel individual and fun
[/list]

[u] Cons [/u]
[list]
[*] The base game world itself feels like a desert with trash lying around, not much colour
[*] Moxxi's Underdome is a terrible DLC
[*] DLC's only include fast travel in the starting point, so you have to get around everywhere by walking or driving
[/list]

[h1] Achievements [/h1]

It took me over 90 hours to finish the main story, have some fun, and complete all the achievements for the game. Most of the time I found myself having fun doing the tasks for the achievements, however, the Underdome achievements which required about 8 hours of boring and repetitive playtime, and the Claptrap loot achievements which had the drop rate of 1/200 were really boring. It felt good to finally get them, but they lacked the fun that I was fond of when completing the other ones. It felt more like I was doing a job than playing a game. 

8/10

"
6280,"It's not bad, in short bursts, but I personally never enjoyed games with bullet spongy enemies, and this is exactly what Borderlands is.

Probably better in co-op."
6281,"I had a blast playing this game, graphics are solid, lots of loot to hunt for, really enjoyed the vehicle combat.  Played through it a few times, the DLC gets a bit confusing on what level to go through it at, but overall a fun first installment for the IP.
I have played Borderlands 2 and still think this one is the go to game for this series.  Played through with a buddy and that is when the game really shines.  Overall worth the cost of admission.
"
6282,"I like it because it is like Left 4 Dead 2, but open world and hard and punishing."
6283,10/10 would collect again
6284,"1. If you like [i]Diablo[/i] and also enjoy the mass murder of human beings from a first person perspective, this game is for you.

2. It is impossible to overstate how cool the art style is on this. The sort of not-quite-cel-shaded look is often remarked upon but it bears repeating and also mentioning how well this file fits w/ and sets the overall vibe [i]Borderlands[/i] is going for.

3. The  vibe [i]Borderlands[/i] is going for is kind of a pulpy spaghetti western thing only set in outer-space w/ a million murderous psychopaths running loose. No big deal.

4. I had numerous technical problems running this on an AMD card in Windows 10. It crashed every ten minutes or so on my R9-based system--though it looked amazing for those ten minutes, running smoothly in QHD w/ most settings turned up to max. Ultimately it ran just fine on a budget laptop w/ AMD R6 (whatever that is) integrated graphics w/ all the settings turned down in 720p. The thing is even w/ those diminished stats, it still looked awesome. This is the power of good art. See number 2.

5. I had to go into .ini files to fix screen tears on both PCs. Come on, people! How hard is it to put vsync options in the damn game menu.

6. This game has no plot. I mean, it does, technically but it can be summed up as follows: You are looking for a thing for some reason and you just do everything anyone tell you to and eventually you *spoilers* succeed in finding that thing.

7. Despite not really having a plot, I think the devs did a decent job w/ universe building. There are an array of inter-planetary mega corporations pulling strings and you get the feeling there is a lot more going on beneath the surface of what is revealed to you. The set and setting here are good but they are not used to their fullest potential.

8. The only song that struck me as being terribly good in this whole thing was the music that rolls during the end credits. That song is called ""No Heaven"" by DJ Champion and it's a good time. I thought the score was competent and set the mood reasonably well but it is not the kind of thing that sticks w/ you after you've finished playing the game.

9. The sound design was borderline excellent. I loved the gun sound effects. I felt like directional sounds of approaching enemies could have been done better though. More than once while I was playing w/ headphones, I had to check if I had the ears reversed because I kept turning the wrong way to find enemies based on sound. 

10. I played this w/ a controller because playing it w/ mouse and keyboard just made me feel like a huge nerd. It's a console game at heart--not that there's anything wrong w/ that.

11. The planet you are on seems to have been used for some failed mining venture. I think they would have been better off just selling all the ammunition that constantly regenerates everywhere forever all over the planet. I played nearly thirty-five hours and worried about ammo exactly twice the whole time playing. 

12. I played through just once in single player. I guess a lot of people think this game is more fun when you have a bunch of people online w/ you exercising their inalienable right to use an alt-right vocabulary (but only when their faces are well out of your punching range).

13. This is the first game in the series and shows great potential. It could definitely use a little polish in terms of the menu and map systems and, especially, could deal w/ a better developed plot. This said, this is not necessarily the kind of game you buy because you want to be diving in menus or watching cut scenes. If you are looking for a good time and want to kill some virtual people, you are ultimately going to have to look to later games in this series if you expect to find anything better."
6285,Great game time and time again
6286,GAME OF THE YEAR
6287,"Borderlands retains its value through intricate skill trees for the time of release, mounds of loot, and its crude, dark humor. We're talking psychotic bandit lords with spiked nipples.

In comparison, Borderlands 2 is more colorful, it has dedicated focus on a villain, and the skill trees have extra variety. However, the first game rewards useful weapons more often, bolstering the arcade experience. As for the setting, you might even find the desolateness of Borderlands to be more fitting for the vault hunters.

Grab the GOTY on sale, for the DLCs introduce more guns and class modifications, as well as environments with new enemies. Don't look for a memorable story, but instead enjoy the spirited action present in all Borderlands games."
6288,"Not as good as BL2 or The Pre-Sequel, largely due to a drab and ugly environment coupled with overcomplicated mechanics (good luck figuring out how Elemental guns REALLY work). Still, an amazing game, and I reccomend playing it BEFORE the later titles, so that you aren't annoyed by lacking features, and so that you can better appreciate the improvements of the later games."
6289,"10/10 would play again.

Not as ingle thing I can say about this game that was bad."
6290,comparing it to the other borlands games this one is wayy worse full of bugs really just 0 story and extremly easy of doomness nad... well not that funny
6291,The Best Co-op Game
6292,A really good game very time consuming.
6293,"So, I went into this game expecting a masterpiece from the get go, and was disappointed for the first 4 hours. My own fault really. It was a change of pace from games I had just finished and I had high expectations because of people saying it was brilliant.
However I found myself compelled to keep playing it for some reason, eventhough I didn't think I was actually enjoying it (for the first few hours). Then I started to get into the flow of things, as soon as my guns improved and I had experimented with different types, I started to enjoy it more and more. Enemies in general became more fun to beat as I got in to the rythm of the game. Even quests which seemed so menial and boring on paper were actually fun and I looked forward to them every time I came back to the game. By the end of the main story Borderlands had me really hooked, and I'm looking forward to completing all the side missions, something I have never felt so compelled to do in any other game.

I would definitely recommend this game. Just be aware that you need to stick at it for the first few hours, and not give up hope if you find it boring or disappointing. The effort will be worth it, as the rest of the time you spend with the game will be a blast! I am currently playing Borderlands 2 on writing this review, and I will say it is excellent so far. Not to discourage people from playing this game, but Borderlands 2 is just way better again."
6294,Best Game Ever!
6295,"too easy 
pffft 
:("
6296,"Before, I made a review about this when I was in the 6th grade. To this day, the game still holds up as one of my favorite to play, after what I would say is a decently long time, since I graduated since then and have played many games with story aspects that would rival this (like skyrim). I'd say however, that if you want to get this dont expect to do multiplayer since it was powered by gamespy at the time, which is now down. I havent bothered to look into a fix for multiplayer since I mostly played offline. 

All in all the game is a structurally sound masterpiece (comparing to more recent titles) and I would say that the more recent borderlands games have lost the challenge and excitement that the earlier 2 games had, that ESPECIALLY this game had."
6297,"This game is great, especially for lower spec gamer!
running perfectly well on 2 gigs ram potato laptop. 40-60 fps (1280x720 all low setting but put detail high)
It is a FPS game with touches of semi cartoon or sketch but not too childish thing, I would say.
pretty much enjoyable, explore the big world and shoot & loot.

The main game has a full 40 hours content, plus the graphic is great imo considering it was released 2009. 
The Dr. Ned Zombies DLC took me around 4-5 hours to complete, I'm going to completed this game as I get all of the DLCs available, so I will update this review time by time I finished each of the DLC.
The Claptrap's New Robot Revolution at Tartarus Station took me 5-6 hours to complete.
Thank you for reading and make sure to rate this review :D"
6298,"Borderlands.What can I say about this classic piece of art? It's fun and well a treasure in my book. I played this game first on my PS3. When that was ruined(my PS3) I seen it on here so I decided to buy it. Man I forgot what I was missing, i'm glad I bought it again and played it. Anyway, Borderlands is one of those games that are great for passing time or just wanting to kill a lot of things with a variety of weapons. Now I hope to get the other two in the future. It's a great game and I recommend everyone give it a SHOT. Get it? HA!(corny joke).

"
6299,7/10 would cry again
6300,"The art style is different than any game I've ever played, and I've played a lot of games! I say this as a good thing. It makes the game unique! It also has a lot to offer gameplay wise. Very addicting and I can't seem to put it down. I would reccomend this game!"
6301,"This is a must play. The mechanics are very good, the graphics are amazingly unique and the story is awesome."
6302,"I recommend this game because it was and still is a very fun co-op game, I had a blast playing it when release, I bought it later on steam, but it's not really a lot of fun playing it alone, and my friend who I played this series with enjoys the later installements of the game."
6303,Best game ever made. Go play it.
6304,"Very Fun game, want to waste your time?(in a good way) Play the dang game!!!"
6305,"If you haven't played this game yet, do yourself a favour and pick it up. 
I'm playing this on an i3 with 8 gb of RAM and a GT 330m graphics card. The game runs wonderfully, no lag, no framedrop, no problem.
Story is decent.
Combat mechanics are interesting and varied. Having a diverse arsenal will help you , but choosing to specialise in 2, maybe 3,weapon classes will also benefit you, due to the fact that the more you use a weapon the more exp you get for it and the stronger it becomes.
There are multiple ways to fast travel, one of which comes up after a few missions.
My suggestion is wait for a steam sale and pick it up along with the DLC.
Bonus: you can play with a friend!!! :D"
6306,"While this game may be lacking in voice overs and story when compared to Borderlands 2...do not think this is a bad game.  It is amazingly fun to play and has surprisingly good graphics and sound quality for 2009. Definitely a game everyone should play, the start of one of the best series of games."
6307,"Bought this game a long time ago on xbox and on steam , fun as game to play. I finished it twice in the last week (solo and co-op) Class choices are fun and unique looking forward the second playthrough in the futre and excited to play Borderlands 2 with my friend tomorrow and finishing that one some time soon aswell. One of the only games I've ever finished really recommend this game well worth it."
6308,"The game is worth it's price. The FPS RPG style is pretty interesting. No complaints about the gameplay. Multiplayer is fun, single is fun too. Gotta love it."
6309,5/10 Best weapon exchange simulator 2009
6310,"Approximate amount of time to 100%: 151 hours
Estimated achievement difficulty: 8.5/10 (for Rare Specimen)
Minimum number of playthroughs needed: 4 (All four characters have Action Skill achievements a few levels in)

Multiplayer achievements:Yes (Group LF Healer, There's No ""I"" In ""Team"", United We Stand etc...)
Missable achievements: No, you could always go find it.
Grinding Achievements: Yes, Kills with a certain weapon, cash, levels and the ARENA... oh god... the arena....
DLC-Only achievements: Yes, 4 pieces of DLC that come with very grindy achievements.
Time-gated achievements: No
RNG-achievements: No
Does difficulty affect achievements: No (see below)
Unobtainable/glitched achievements: No, in theory, however the Arena Achievements are practically impossible without some serious grinding (Co-op or not)

Getting to 100% was satisfying. All the achievements except ""Rare Specimen"" were easy to get if you know what you're doing. ""Rare Specimen"" requires some creative thinking.

Some PC port issues but otherwise a good shooter if you have the time and patience for the grind."
6311,"Well this game defines a new genre!
Just play it, 10/10!"
6312,Fun with friends but i don't have any that play with me but still fun even solo
6313,"I asked for a refund i souldnt start the game i spent 4 hours trying to fix it this was my erro http://prntscr.com/df2wx8
and I am pissed my friends want to play with me and we never got a chance"
6314,9/10
6315,"Awesome game with great gameplay and artstyle. The story won't blow you away but the world and characters are hillarious . Play this game with your friends, buy the dlc, except Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot, and I guarantee that you will have fun for more than 40 hours."
6316,"Quite possibly my favourite game. 

PS: whatever playtime it says on steam just add 300+hrs because i played the fuck out of it on x360."
6317,fun
6318,"Yeah got about 50 hours outta this, gotta try."
6319,"Played on PS3 first and never finished it, still haven't cause I'm GADHD (Gaming Attention Deficit Disorder) and keep starting new games before I finish the other. This game is amazing, the look is amazing and still holds up really well combat is great with the four play styles available and generally more than one way to confront enemies, it's a game I feel I will always keep coming back to whenever I need a taste of madness"
6320,"very nice, bl2 best one tho get that out of the three"
6321,"This Game went on sale for a good price that i coudn't turn down for $7.49 
This Game Is Still A Sweet Game Up To Today, i would get the enire thing with the dlc before they not have the steam sales"
6322,"It's Borderlands!  BORDERLANDS!  I shouldn't have to say more.  Fantastic immersive FPS with a fun cartoon edge that tones down the darkness hiding within.  (And believe me, it's pretty dark in some of those corners.)  It's like a more fun Mad Max world, best played on a PC.  Lots to do here, trust me... one of my Top 10 Games of All Time.
"
6323,"this game is simply.... good, its really good. its funny, the combat is fast paced but can take a while to finish a battle at the same time. so i your considering buying this game.. you should

(and all the borderlands games have a really useful colorblind mode, all the weapons rareness is dictated by the color of it in your inventery and the game has the color written at the bottom)"
6324,"Hardly needs another positive review, but...

Borderlands stands the test of time.  Charm, wit, challenge, reward.  Good times commence."
6325,"1. I highly recomend this game to anyone who wants to play a FPS without the hassles of games like COD or Halo. 
2. the art style is also diffrent from any game I've ever played and I love it! 
3. the story is great and the NPCs all have their own personalities.

9/10 wish I could forget it and play it for the first time again.

#shut up claptrap
"
6326,"Now this is a very taste of a person, which borderlands he likes more. Personally I like more Borderlands 1 than 2. Why? The characters, story, the art game style, music and other things. Definietly gonna recommend this one and makes even more fun to play with your friends. What are you waiting? Claptrap is awaiting you, wub wub!"
6327,Very cool game
6328,goodgame
6329,"Excellent.  Holds its own even many years after its release.  The graphics style has aged well, and the gameplay itself is phenomenal.  I have over 50 hours and have barely scratched the surface.  If you liked Borderlands 2, get this!  (Not the pre-sequel, which is a complete failure).  If you haven't played a borderlands game, well, I would say that 2 is still the better game, but 1 is excellent.  You will not miss out on that much storyline wise if you jump right into 2, rather it will just be cool to get the background information if you come back here afterwards.  

I highly recommend buying this game.  The DLC is solid as well."
6330,Not fun unless played myltiplayer with friends ^^
6331,"Well then, looks like you need to do less reading and more buying and playing!"
6332,Nice! Graphics and Storyline
6333,This game is so much fun! The fact you can respec your character depening if you are in solo our multiplayer to suit the situation makes it a great personal experience but also one you can share with friends. Sure the graphics are dated but the shooting and the humour is still great.
6334,I grew up playing this game and still play this game today. I would stongly recomend this game because of the story and the endless amount differant weapons are in the game. Playing with a friend has its bennifits and is more fun. I recomend all of the borderlands games.
6335,"I've heard the game being described as Diablo with guns. If Diablo was like this, I would definitely have played it."
6336,"Started playing 2009, Im still playing it in 2016."
6337,Best Game Ever
6338,Only played a couple of hours cause i dont have a lot of time but until now it has been amazing. Will update once I have more play-time.
6339,"I loved this game as a kid, it still holds up it may not be as polished as borderlands 2 but it still has a great personality and a great place to start such an epic franchise."
6340,10/10 Would Vault Again
6341,this deserves the 5 more minutes award. from mission to mission. fun game tho.
6342,Not bad at all.
6343,Love it
6344,"Oldie but goodie. Really funny, intense, and captivating."
6345,A really great game when bundled with the dlcs. Many hours played on it.
6346,One of my firsts games i grinded in 2009 it was really fun but i hope they remaster it
6347,"Even today still a great game, I played trough it several times (had the retail version)."
6348,Best Co Op game Ever
6349,A really lovely game with millions of guns
6350,"It has certainly been a while since i played this game and want to say my PTSD has dropped so i guess i might as well review the game. Oh dear god no. Well i am reviewing the game in a pro / con style and ending the game with my conclusion. I want to warn you that i am review the game in 2016 not based on when it came out. You have been warned.

Pro:
      The guns sound pretty cool. I really enjoy the sound of jacob snipers mainly since i played as the sniper dude primarily. Yes i really dont know how to spell his name so i am calling him the sniper dude. Regardless firing the guns felt like a treat with how the guns sound. The guns simply had a charming sound i like.

       Each character you choose has their own abilities and unique perks the player could choose from. This helps separate the different play styles that can be obtained with each character such as running in killing everyone with your fists or hanging back and picking people off with your sniper.

       The guns leveled up the more you used them, that was pretty cool to see that me killing enemies was worth something more than just exp and money. Now my accuracy with a sniper is even higher or i do more damage with headshot or whatever. It felt that every kill i did ment something more.

Con:
      Is there a story? That is a legit question since i honestly do not know. Pretty much the game progression is mission based where you dont necessarily get plot related exposition. When i played through the game it felt that i am just doing missions and not progressing any story what so ever. I want to say you do like five or seven mission till you get to some major plot related part where you get a vault peice and then the game slows back down and that means more missions that feel there for padding. If we take out all the padding i think the game would last for like one and a half hours long.

        Wall of text when accepting a mission. I dont know if this is how they explain the story or what not but no one has the time to read something that is more than a few sentences long. It kills the pacing of the game to finish killing a ton of enemies to be greeted by a large ammount of text probably used a exposition..

        The wasteland is boring. What killed me more than the feeling of lack of progression is being in the wasteland for about 99% of the game. It is brown really makes me tired. I enjoy seeing more locations rather than strictly wasteland.

        Was there music? Well i dont know because i turned it off after my playthrough. None of the music really stood out to me as entertaining or gave me a feeling of a cohesive atmosphere. So yea music is a negative.

         Dlc was it great? Well it did add more to the story but struggled being all around interesting. Alot of bosses were just too much for one person soloing who is a sniper character. The zombie island one I will give a like since it has zombies and i certainly do enjoy a good zombie experience. Not that it was great but was something to do, slaughtering undead. Other dlc i can sum up as just meh.

         Moxxies underdome....Yea that dlc is just horrible. Your in this survival mode where you kill wave on wave of enemies. Ok but that is not all says the game. You must also survive the buffs or debuffs that the player or enemies experience on every round. Now i roll my eyes in annoyance but that is not all says the game. You must survive 5 rounds made up of 5 waves each round which means a total of 25 waves. Now i slam my head against my desk but that is not all says the game. After doing that for each of the 3 respective arena's you can do it all over again but this time you will have 20 or 25 rounds made up of 5 waves per round. At this point i turn off the game to prevent the game from saying but wait there is more to this dlc. It has not story soooo why is it even here? It isnt even fun, it is a misserable chore to do.

         Fires a shot from a powerful gun and get no hit even when i am aiming right at the enemy. Yea there is this nasty little issue where sometimes your bullets dont count. You fire a shot and you know you hit them but the game is like hahaha no you didnt and you just wasted some useful ammo for your most powerful gun.

         Fires a shot from a powerful gun and get a damage counter of 0. I am not joking with this. It is similar to the issue just above but this time i get an indication i hit them and the damage i see is 0. I am a higher level than the enemy and using a higher level gun but still manage to get a damage output of 0.

Conclusion:
          This game was just too much for me to do. After i got my 100% list i was done and took a break from it. I should of done a review earlier but had PTSD from the game. I can not recommend the game for 2 reasons. 1 all the issues i pointed out in my list. 2 if you get borderlands 2; it has a story and gives a really brief segment about what happened in borderlands 1. So with that you can skip the game entirely and not be confused about the sequal. Again this game probably was good way back then but now it just is not, i recommend borderlands 2 over this because it is in everyway better. Good to see the developers took peieces of this game and made a master peice with it's sequal."
6351,Do you like to shoot stuff and get loot ? do you like to open hidden chests and get loot ? do you like loot ? did i mention there is loot ? easily my favorite game ever i never get tired of playing this I own it on xbox and thats were all my time is spent raiding with friends on the surface of pandora
6352,"A very simple,  easy to learn, shooter set in a place where you don't fell bad about shooting people and things. It has rog stats that build as you kill things. it Goves you new guns to play with. it has mad max jokes. 

Pretty good for $5."
6353,"Believe me, you'll be left in awe"
6354,Accidentally rammed my friend out of bounds... 10/10
6355,Yea
6356,"Obsessively played this back in the xbox 360 days. And honestly it's is still a blast to playthrough now (Just started another playthrough not long ago). It's really worth the full price but if it's on sale, you need to just buy it."
6357,"Pretty good game. Offered more than i expected.
Good graphics, soundtrack, lots of jokes and funny moments.
I don't regret."
6358,Works very nice for co-op gaming.
6359,"Awesome game. Had it on my list for a while, but got the series on sale, love it."
6360,The best game ever :)
6361,"This review is mostly for the Steam awards badge.
Good game though, you should totally get it."
6362,Nice
6363,"If i have to use one word to describe this game I would say that this game is SICK!
With awesome soundtrack, great characters, tons of humour and a lot of action you won't be bored.
"
6364,Amazing game fun combat co op and hilarious jokes 8/10
6365,Loved this game ever since it came out and that was years ago. Still get a lot of gameplay out of it to this day.
6366,"As you can see with the amount of hours I've put in this game, it's definitely worth your purchase.
But! Buy this game as Game of the Year edition because the DLC make this game so much better.

10/10, would purchase again."
6367,"Review based on the whole franchise (over 300 hours overall):

- Good and fun FPS. But has a ""slowish"" pace in comparison to BRLD2 and BRLD:PS
- Well writen with fun characters.
- Co-Op for up to 4 players with an extra couple of maps designed for duels between friends.
- If you played BRLD2 first like myself you will have a lot of ""Oh! So that's why _____ happened in the sequel"" moments.
- 1 ""serious"" DLC (General Knoxx) that requires lots of traveling.
- 2 funny DLC (Dr. Ned's and Claptrap's) with several new enemies and cool maps to explore .
- 1 arena type DLC (Moxxi's Underdome) with a ton of challenges and randomized battles.
- Raid Bosses for those that are looking for a challenge after beating the game.

tl;dr: Fun and balanced FPS"
6368,"This game is by far my favourite game of all time. It is the game that got me into gaming. If your looking for a fun shooter with interesting quests and fun characters, check it it out. With a second playthrough and four DLC's the fun is always there.Don't knock till you try it!!!"
6369,"Amazing game, only a few flaws.

+ A lot of loot

- A lot of loot
(and the accuracy makes no sense)"
6370,The univers of borderlands is limitless give it a fucking shot !
6371,Borderlands is absolute hell for somebody that is anal about completing or collecting things. I NEED that new weapon. I NEED to reach the highest level. I NEED one more kill. I NEED to discover everything. It's addicting as all and will keep you coming back for more. Getting all the achievements is impossible though now.
6372,"If you hoard items, this game will cause you great distress"
6373,"Great game, great series."
6374,"this clamed my life
"
6375,LOOOTINGGG IS REALLLL
6376,"I haven't played the entirety of this game yet, but holy crap is it awesome. I'm not good at FPSs, but Borderlands makes you feel like just as big a badass as the ones you kill. Great characters, amazing NPC design, and hilarious flavour text. This game is definitely worth the small cash drop."
6377,Best game i've ever played!
6378,Still my favorite game.
6379,good game 9/10
6380,"All the borderlands games are worth every dollar you spend, they are different from other games

:) 
"
6381,"Borderlands will always have a special place in my heart. With it's great sense of humour, deep gameplay and generally fun-ness, the trilogy is a must for anyone who likes a shooting game that anyone can play and master while still being funny and awesome."
6382,"I cannot say enough good things about this game. After I played it I purchased every other game in the franchise. It is just one of those must play games. One that keeps you coming back for more. Lovable characters, including the villians. Setting is great, quests are awesome. I can't decided if I like the guns, the pyschos or the alien lifeforms the best! If I could only play one game for the rest of my life - it would definitely be a Borderlands game."
6383,"O melhor exemplo de que um jogo de acção pode ficar sempre mellhor com um bocado de sentido de humor... e podes rir-te com mais três amigos...!

The best example that an action game can always get better with a little of sense of humor ... and you can laugh with three more friends ...!"
6384,"Delightful sarcasm, difficult bosses, and a great storyline! A+"
6385,"I know I said I wasn't gonna update you again, you brainless moppet, but I thought I would share the news that former Agent Athena has been working with a quartet of donkeys that bested our bulimic albino commandant. You remember Athena, right? Killed the Dahl undersecretary for us a while back? Oh wait, that was before you were born. Unbelieveable. What am I doing with my life? Well, wanted to let you know I'll just be shooting the whole lot of 'em... Oh, and I quit. When this mission is done I'm leaving the Lance, which I know is punishable by death, but the suits that change your diapers couldn't find their car keys if they dropped 'em into their own pockets. So I'm not too worried that you'll track me down on the other side of Grophic IV. In conclusion, toodles. - Knoxxed Out"
6386,The best mix of hack'n'slash+RPG+FPS+Coop+fun = Borderlands :)
6387,"Doing this for the badge, but honestly this game is still really fun."
6388,"Normally i dont play FPS game, but this games hooks me up, i cant stop play this."
6389,It's a pretty damn good game.
6390,Great game!
6391,"Shooting, levelling, dark humour. I finished the game on console, transferred the saves to my PC and now finishing my last DLC. Even runs on my laptop. Great game!"
6392,"I just got back to playing this game for the DLC, and it is stil just as exciting as when I first played the game. Not a lot of games stand the tests of time as well as the Borderlands series, and that is a very serious accomplishment."
6393,"Borderlands is a very good game, you can play this game hundreds of hours and it's still amazing. It's totally worth it to buy this game. :) 10/10"
6394,Oh boy..
6395,writing this review for a badge
6396,A full on game charger
6397,"Amazing game, own across two platforms. The start of one of the best FPS franchises."
6398,Borderlands is a very good game
6399,asd
6400,Still one of the best co-op games out there!
6401,"Outstanding. Still, after two sequels."
6402,a must for all fps gamers
6403,10 out of 10
6404,Best game ever!!
6405,"- is a MustHave game.
BL 2 is gorgeous, but only part of this game - Borderlands 1

GRAB IT NOW"
6406,"I just decided to give this game a chance last week and I don't regret it.  Loads of fun and addictive.  I also admire the unique artsyle, which is atypical of shooters (and even other genres).  Pick this one up!"
6407,"Still pretty good though.
Wanna waste tons of hours on mindlessly blowing heads into pieces with all kinds of hillarious weapons.
There you go !



"
6408,all sizzle no steak.
6409,"game: bought
handsome jack: does not feature in it
me: out"
6410,Truly a special game
6411,"Absolutely amazing game. I love the cell shaded style of it and diversity of what you can choose your character to be.

Lots of really good dry and adult humour as well as some silly things thrown in too.

Currently played 2 of 4 of the DLC. The Zombie island was fun, if a little long and repetative. I didn't enjoy Moxxi's Underdome but if you're enjoy battle arena's it may be for you!

Will update after completing the game and the other two DLC. Highly recommended!"
6412,Favourite COOP fps.
6413,The best game in the Borderlands series by far!
6414,Hotdog down a skag den know what I'm saying?
6415,"This is my favorite ""2K Games"" game. This game looks great, and it's not like to many other games."
6416,The Diablo of the FPS world. :)
6417,"More fun then setting skags on fire, the coolest simple-est, just shoot everything that moves, with the most weapons you can shake a stick at. When playing with four players, nothing compares.
Not to mention the dialog is so F*** hillarious, they must have hired some Bogans from down under. Don't know what that is, my freinds would love to ""meat"" you!"
6418,Good times
6419,One of the best Co-op games! Crazy addictive!!! Great black humor!
6420,One of the best game series
6421,Very fun with friends.
6422,gg great game fav of the borderlands series
6423,If an RPG and FPS had a badass lovechild this would be it 10/10 good for hours of enjoyment with minimal boredom
6424," A fun game with friends, that has plenty of gore and guns. What more could you ask for?"
6425,"Although it's old, its a very good game, to get the full extent of action you'd need to complete the secondary quests to make the primary ones easier"
6426,Some of the best times I've had in a game.
6427,"Get guns, shoot people, get more guns, shoot your friends. What's not to love? A great deal of memories created through bullets and insane ridiculousness. Still as much fun to pick up and play with buddies as it was the first day."
6428,11/10 found cool stuff in Dookie Hut
6429,"This game is hours and hours of fun and exploring, and shooting the heck out of baddies!  No better way to spend a winter indoors than deciding which weapons you like best, cos there's like 87 bazillion guns! :D"
6430,this game has a bad  problem and it is Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library Error pless fix this i what to play Borderlands but i cant !!! fix it or tell me how to fix this
6431,"I bought this game on pc back in like 2015 but i played it on PlayStaition 3 back in like 2012 i played before the others came out and i love being there on the arrival of the game before the others come out my brother bought it but didnt like the comicy graphics (he prefers realistic games) and i have him to thank for it because i got my neighbour to come over and we played for hours every day i remember being in tesco (xD tesco) and saw a GameMaster magazine i dont read them regularly infact it was the only one ive gotten to this day it was fffffffffourteen ffffffffffffuckin euros but me mammy dearest got it for me, i knew i had to see this it announced borderlands 2 on the front page i got the mag showed to my friend and i got BL1 for xbox 1 (with dlcs) and played on that and in the meantime me and my bestfriend prepared our anus' for borderlands 2 we always thought the game looked a bit dull at times (we still loved it to bits) and thought the budget must of been low and we didnt expect BL2 but we sure hoped for it (we didnt know much about companies networth like 2k or gearbox we had to find stuff ourselves because no internet) but anyway ive been here since the beginning and i fucking love the Borderlands series and i can assure you my sperm resovoir fucking collapsed when we heard of pre sequel coming out

And also please abondon or sell BattleBorn it disappointed many BL fans and its basically overwatch but with lots more bugs"
6432,one of my favorite game of al time
6433,"Blow shit up with your fists
make a bird kill everything in your path
teleport in and around enemies dealing mutliple elemental damage effects
or just throw down a turret and shoot em up

with over 100,000 different types of guns and for all 4 characters there are 3 different skill trees the options to this game are limitless, the characters in the story timeless, the story telling amazing and the map packs actually add something to this game instead of just giving more useless quests each one has their own story arche. I've beat this game on console, beat it on PC, and yet I still keep buying it everytime it's on sale so I have more people to play with. One of the best games ever created."
6434,"I love this game. It has a good story line, beautiful graphics and it's pretty long."
6435,Needs more guns/10
6436,Hey have you seen my gun?
6437,looks cool. is fun. who would want more??
6438,good story & a lot of fun
6439,Has made me believe in God again. 7/10
6440,Old but gold!
6441,"One of the best games I ever played. Hundred of hours of fun.
You will never get tired of it. Well you will get tired but you will come back later for more.
Best apocalitical game I played."
6442,"much content , beauty cartoon graphics,20 + hours of gameplay!"
6443,"First game of my favorite series of games.
Lots of room for improvement overall but pretty good considering it's age.
Really got me into the shoot n loot genre, my favorite genre now :)"
6444,"Let me first say, that I was NEVER into shooting games, but that changed with Borderlands. Really, a MUST HAVE. The game  has a very unique gameplay style, plenty of gameplay hours, lots of missions, and just the whole dessert feeling and the suroundings give you an extremely good atmosphere.

I can just say, that it is a GREAT game, I am more into stratagy games like the total war series, But Borderlands made me very curious and has a place in my mind of some good old times in the middle of the deserts ;) ! 

People who still doubt, the money is worth it for what you get from it !"
6445,"Best soundtrack, best way to kill badguys, best way to laugh hard on those jokes!"
6446,best co-op game since shrek n' roll
6447,"Borderlands turned from an impulse purchase to a long lasting funny gaming experience. The single player mode is totally worthy to play (for all who like to play alone). Even though there were some tedious moments, I also enjoyed playing the DLCs."
6448,Really good game.
6449,"This game is not bad, all u need is 4 men/women squad with funny momonets"
6450,"I know games, i have the bast games, People love it. And you know what, it have been very successful. Everybody loves it and you know why? Because it's the best game.
Rate 10/pepperuni"
6451,Cool art style and if you can't afford the big titles play this.
6452,"Play with friends for the best experience, Diablo meets FPS with Mad Max world. I enjoyed the humor but not everyone will."
6453,"One of the best games out there, great games if you love MMOs as it is shoot to kill and run to loot."
6454,"reminds me of when i was young dem memories
"
6455,"An older game, but a game that aged really well. Some of the mechanics and level scaling is off but that just adds to the challenge of this game. The game is quite bland and boring in terms of landscape but that is imporved drastically in its sequel, plus i dont really mind the landscape"
6456,"It´s very fun game. Your can pass hours just traveling in the world, just for fun..."
6457,Still as good as always.
6458,"If not for Borderlands 2, this game would win the, ""Best Game Ever Created In The History Of Games That Have Ever Been Created, Ever!"" award. True story!"
6459,"Really fun on your own, and even better with a friend or two, Borderlands is a game that can be difficult, but also rewarding"
6460,"Had fun playing it, but this isnt a singleplayer game. The ending was bad also, but hey, nobody is perfect."
6461,"The game is perfect. Can't add more :)

Just buy this masterpiece 5/5"
6462,Still an amazing game! <3
6463,Great game :)
6464,Perfect.
6465,who says there are too many guns???
6466,10/10 IGN
6467,GG!!!!!!!!!!
6468,"Still really good to play with friends 7 years later! Has way more nostalgic value than Borderlands 2 to me, maybe partly because this game is older, but it gives me a whole other feeling than the second game does. Recommend it to everyone who's a fan of shooters and wants to play a memorable game!"
6469,"An instant and timeless classic. Spent well over 1500+ hours on xbox playing on a singular Roland account, granade jumping, wall glitching, and speed running my way through countless trys for infinite loot in General Knoxxs armoury. Scored the best guns in the game 5 times over, scored modded weapons that caused endless explosions, sent players flying, and crashing the game for others. 

Would play another 1500+ hours/10"
6470,A classic that started a legendary franchise.
6471,"I really like this game. I feel like the graphics are bad, but that could be because it was made in the early 2000's. Anyway, this game is fun, there is many stuff to unlock, and there is much to do. I also like the humor thrown into the game which was cool. I really recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of FPS's and adventure games."
6472,"Played the hell out of this game and still do.  While I was late to the game, it is a classic, well worth it to buy."
6473,Pretty good
6474,the 1st borderlands is the best in my opinion out of all of them so far !
6475,"Great way to kill some time while playing an FPS.  Absolute blast to play online with friends.  Cell shaded graphics are aging nicely, IMO."
6476,"Visually lush, a pleasure to play with friends or alone, and an incredible dystopian desert aesthetic - Borderlands is a great game. My only criticism would be the odd storyline, especially the ending - but don't let that scare you off!"
6477,"A game that has  almost no end. After finishing it the first time you can choose a harder mode. Mutiple characters and mutiple builds. weapons to play around with. Hidden secrets, great story, fun characters, great DLC, great graphics that still looks good today. oh, and the best weapons dealer in history.  :)"
6478,"Sick sense of humor! orthodox grafics, amazaing learning curve, out of the box loot :P
allin all an amazing experience :)"
6479,Love the art style. Fun game with a good story.
6480,Its great... what else to say
6481,"When Borderlands came out, it was a game you couldn't just drop, it had a compelling story (Vault Hunters, Pandora and of course The Vault), there was always one surprise after another and it kept an up beat and fun vibe during the whole game. GUNS, GUNS, and more GUNS!!! Might I also add the DLC's were quite good IMO. My first playthrough was on my xbox and once I had my pc I had to buy it on steam. It felt like a new genre giving a twist to the formal FPS with RPG features!! Co-op was Great!!!! Writing this makes me want to take a shot at Borderlands once more!!"
6482,a must own to any gamers self
6483,It's pretty good. Buy it.
6484,JUST EPIC.
6485,I still Love this game
6486,"Don't let my only about 100 hours (as of writing this review) in this game fool you. This game is one of my favorite time sinks of all time. I think I've put in about 900 hours on the xbox 360 and still keep coming back to it. If you're going to start the Borderlans series, definitely don't skip this game, or better yet start with it (especially since there's no handsome Jack). There's so much to do in the game and you can play it melee, mid-range or from far awat. The DLC are really good in this game too."
6487,Stayed up 3 days straight playing it.
6488,"Personally, I've never been too into shooters. However, this game isn't just a shooter; it's so much more. Collecting awesome weapons, brilliant story line, fascinating characters...

If you haven't already played the game, buy it and when you're done, get the next one!"
6489,"Must have. Play it for hours of STORY, choose your mission and do it like no other ever ;D"
6490,I Have Had So Much Fun Playing This Game. Kool Story Line. Lots Of Loot. And Some Hilarious Dialog. Overall A Great Game!!!
6491,"Most epic, awesome, ass-kicking, head-blowing, BADASS game EVER!"
6492,"Very good game, still playing it after a few years. Review just for the badge lol."
6493,best fps game ever try it!!!
6494,I think this is one of the best coop games to play with friends.
6495,"Very good game if you're looking for a looter-shooter.
Has good replayability since you can try out four different classes and lots of different weapons and skill builds.
Compared to its sequels more of the loot is usable and the combat does not depend on if you can one-shot the enemy before it can one-shot you. Overall a very fun game to play solo or with a group."
6496,The legendary series of coop-games!
6497,[spoiler] probably the best shooter of all times and spaces [/spoiler]
6498,This game has been out several years and has had three sequels.  I will say this is still the best of them where I keep coming back with various friends to try different builds and different classes.  A lot of memories started here and I suggest everyone pick it up whether it's on sale or not.
6499,I would gladly recommend the entire borderlands series to anyone! Did not play the first game on Steam but had loads of fun with it. Had to buy it again to be able to grind for acheivements in the future >:D
6500,is actually pretty good.  stay away from online unless you want hacked everythings.
6501,"Simply one of the best Games ever, I rarely hade fun like this."
6502,"It's a marvelous game, it has guns, it's an RPG, and it has humour. Great replayability and a lot of fun with friends"
6503,"Put most of my time of this game on console back in the day so my 26 hours do not do the thousands I put in justice, but this game will always have a special place in my heart."
6504,One of the BEST FPS ever made!
6505,There are always a better and more awesome weapon laying around somewhere
6506,"Amazing environments, guns, tons of action, more guns, awesome characters, kill, destroy, even more guns, what else can you need?

PROS: The aesthetics, the music, the atmosphere and the action. Great multiplayer mode also.
CONS: My friends are never ready to play when I am :P

Definitely recommended!

UPDATE: The end of the game is pretty disappointing, but... the journey to it was fun."
6507,One of the best games i have played on ps3 and i had to buy it again on pc to play it again :)
6508,"[h1]Borderlands Time![/h1] 

Borderlands, 
C'mon grab your guns, 
We're going to very distant lands. 
With Mordecai the Hunter and 
Lilith the Siren, 
The fun will never end, 
It's Borderlands!"
6509,"super fun game , very good lead up to #2"
6510,what a game guys/10
6511,One of the best games I have played. Story is good and progressing and there are plenty of side missions to do also.
6512,beste alde
6513,"Fun game to play with friends. Will always be entertaining, easy to spend some time and go dakka dakka crazy.
A little outdated nowadays with Borderlands2 but still fun and worth a few hours to complete the main quests if you happen to get it with a discount at 5€ as right now.

"
6514,best coop game ever made
6515,"One of the BEST games ever made!

Especially its Co-op mode!"
6516,Nice one
6517,"The first game in a series that is beloved for its vast array of different guns, a story which has both depth and breadth and characters who you'll never forget.

"
6518,"This game is pure absolute fun.  Everything just plain works, and can be played by just about anyone regardless of skill level."
6519,9.5/10
6520,"I mean, its borderlands, so much fun solo or with friends."
6521,EPIC GAME!!!
6522,Amazing game PLAY IT
6523,"Can't say I've made up my mind how much I like this game yet.

But seriously Borderlands is one of those games I dust off every so often and play because it's fun. Definately one of my all time favorites. I think this game has held up very well over the years and is well worth picking up if you don't have it already."
6524,One of the best games of all time
6525,Good
6526,Still an excellent rpg shooter in 2016
6527,better than the second one
6528,"This is one of my favorite games of all time. If you have never played it, it being on sale is more that worth it. Get the GOTY edition for all the DLC. It will save you money later when you will want to but them anyways. :)"
6529,is there a video game hall of fame?! this game would be in there..
6530,Have you seen my gun?
6531,"I've played this when it was released, and its successor Borderlands 2, on the 360. Each was amazing and repeating playthroughs with them was still fun because of the large pool of guns that can just pop out from nearly every orifice on Pandora. 4 different characters in this game, and customizable skill trees for each one to adjust your playstyle to adds a whole new layer to the game rather than just ""shoot'n'loot,"" as the game describes. The graphics aren't half-bad either, for a game released in 2009. I'd wholeheartedly reccommend this game, especially if you have a group of friends who are down to play it with you."
6532,"Fps with lots of loot.
Great style in its own way."
6533,"One of my favorite games ever made, Im still constantly coming back time and time again."
6534,"Have this on both console and PC, Beat it more then 20 times. Extremely fun game"
6535,This game is wild and force-taught me to be a tolerable Sniper on Team Fortress 2.
6536,fun game
6537,"Borderlands, the real original kid!
This is probably one of my all time best game. With lots of replayability, enormous amount of content and great overall style, it never ceses to amaze me. The main campaing is pretty much great all the way exept for the infamous dumb last boss, but the real magic of this beauty comes in the game of the year edition with it's crazy DLCs; cool stories, more enemies and loads of guns! Great in single or multiplayer, yet hard and unforgiving, this game diserves my respect and for that I give it a 9.5/10."
6538,"Best. Game. Ever.

Nothing else to say.

(Well, actually there is: don't trust Marcus. He's an asshole.)"
6539,"I played borderlands on ps3 for over a 1000 hours, this is the best fps rpg you will ever play. 'its like christmas'"
6540,old but still as fun as the first time i played the game
6541,"An amazing shoot n loot that is best played with a small group of friends so you can annoy each other all the time.

PROS
-massive variety in weapons, do you want a shotgun that shoots rockets? done. you want a RPG that shoots two rockets at once? here you go.
-unique abilites that can help a lot but i have only played with the punching guy and the sentry dude so idk about the others.
-more quests than just fetch quests and you dont have to turn in some of them.
-very nice art style that you will remember.
-well paced so you cant just run in and tank everything and puch whatever lives from your giant shotgun that shoots rockets.
- E/F mashing simulator.
-you can rob peoples safes in front of them.
-basic animals drop money.
-price is great for the entertainment value.
-plus more i forgot about because i suck

CONS

-playing alone is kinda boring.
-graphially dated but it's unique so it still looks fine.
-claptrap is annoying.
-final boss is very ""Meh""
-spending several minutes figuring out which guns to sell.
-plus maybe one or two more things but still worth it if you have a few friends."
6542,"Wub Wub incoming!
Grab a friend, grab a gun, grab everything you can!

6547,Catch-A-Ride
6548,such anamazing game to play would recoment to everyone 10/10
6549,"Lets Just get right to the TLDR cause this game doesn't need a long review. It's just fantastic and worth it's full price. The art style is timeless, the gunplay is polished and impactful. The loot mechanics are addicting in a good way. The story is tongue in cheek with some seriously hilarious writing. It has a significant amount of dlc content, which is all great. For me this game is truly a classic. I played it on PS3, bought it again here to play through it with my friends again. 10/10"
6550,Loved this game from the beginning to the end. Highly recommend it!
6551,Funniest game I've played in a long time! Borderlands 2 is next!
6552,"Great Game, Still Fun In 2016. Overall Has Lots Of Replay Value. Decent Story With Excellent Gameplay/Enjoyment Ratio. Highly Recommended If You Enjoy Shooters."
6553,A nice Shooter-rpg-adventure game
6554,"Great game from 2009, still great. Wish you could get Atlas guns in later installments since they made the strongest guns I found in game. I still visit my shotgun."
6555,Great game
6556,Best game EUW
6557,"This is the game I always come back to. 
Bad day at work....Headshot.
Someone pissed me off ... head shot.
Traffic sucked...headshot.
Roommates mad at each other for crazy shit...Crotch shot. 

Best way to relieve stress."
6558,I like this game.
6559,This game is fun. I recommend the whole series.
6560,I recently bought borderlands 2 when it went on sale a while ago and it made me miss what I loved about borderlands one. Since I got them both together I might start playing this game again. It really was one of those Whoa Dude! games.
6561,"This game is so awesome, it features tons of tons of tons of tons of Weapons. You never ever find the Same Item twice in this game."
6562,"Very fun game, specially if you have friends to play co-op, now that makes things more interesting!"
6563,good game
6564,Love This Game
6565,"Not only is this one of the best multi-player experiences I've had, but the flavor and art for this game is positively phenomenal!"
6566,Great game
6567,"Still one of my favourites!!!
Great story, brilliant humor and 2734534314337 guns... Couldn't ask for more"
6568,great game
6569,A lot of fun!
6570,I can't decide if I love this game or bored to death and tired and want to go to sleep but I can't because I don't know when it last saved while playin it :/
6571,Nice Characters to play with. Story is funny and exciting. Overall a good game.
6572,"Like 80 Gajillion guns but only <50 inventory spaces, gg.

Fun co-op game with friends, would recommend.
"
6573,One of my most favorite games of all time. The atmosphere is amazing!!!
6574,"I was expecting to use the guy in the cover. But this is simply awesome. 
 I mean, it gets harder and harder, there are planty cool-style and cool-named weapons, badass cars ¡¡and it´s even funny!!"
6575,Pewpew humor and fun times. not as humorous as the others in the series tho.
6576,very good man
6577,10/10
6578,just the best
6579,"For the win

Amazingly fun game"
6580,"Doing this for the autumn sale badge tbh
good game tho, just not as good as 2"
6581,Great old game. Best experienced with a group of friends
6582,I just started playing this again today in a bought of nostalgia after finishing Tales from the Borderlands. I missed this game.
6583,Still super coop.
6584,I come back to Pandora at least once each year!
6585,one of the best game
6586,"Oldie but a goodie, still fun after all these years"
6587,"great game, awsome coop. im loving it"
6588,This game is still a lot of fun
6589,"I originally got this game on xbox 360 when it frist came out. I must have put 100 plus hours into it, beat it multiple times and got every achievement. I got it again on PC years later to experience it again. It is still as fun."
6590,"Even after all this time, Borderlands is still worth playing. In many ways, it is still the best of the series thanks to a great story and fun gameplay.  The DLCs are good too, especially the Dr. Zed Haloween themed one. Just great humor.

Borderlands 2 was a great follow up, but it didn't bring as many new features to the game as many hoped (lots of guns are available, but customization options would have been nice). Thought it did introduce Handsome Jack, and that alone is awesome!

The is a great game to play with friends.  At the current price, you cannot go wrong for this game.

It is a must have game. 10/10

"
6591,One of the first games my husband introduced me to that had me hooked right from the get go. Have spent a lot of time playing this game on PC and on Xbox360. Can't get enough of the story line that I have to keep going back
6592,"The true spiritual successor to Fallout and Fallout 2. It really hits on the wasteland atmosphere, and you find yourself visiting derelicts of a destroyed society in order to uncover the ""mystery of the vault""."
6593,"Despite becoming somewhat aged, Borderlands is an excellent spray and pray, first person shooter. With randomly generated weapons, almost any weapon for any type of player is possible. The myriad of side missions will keep you refreshed, despite the reptitive combat and enemies.
It is easy to find youself spending more time playing beyond the 40ish hours to complete the game as playthrough two brings in harder, more interesting opponents."
6594,"AMAZING game. Most likely one of the best FPS games out there. So, being a Role Playing Shooter, you can now shoot he fuck out of mutant dogs and weird bald midgets with a variery of different shotguns, assault rifles, revolvers, snipers, pistols SMG's, knifes, fists, AND alien weapons. excluding all of that, there's about over 100 MILLION varieties of weapons, without exaggeration. This game is still populated by some people, so whether online or offline, you're bound to have a great time playing this game.
However, no matter how good the storyline is, which is AMAZING, the ending may just disappoint you. 

Mad Moxxi's Underdome: There is a SHIT load of gameplay in this, I remember playing the first 'small' arena on the Xbox 360, I ended up taking 3 hours to complete it. This was no different to my friends either. Also, after every round which is completed, a certain amount of weapons are dropped on the floor as a reward. as well as, of course, health and ammo."
6595,"One of my personal favorites, shoot n loot, the graphics look a bit dated in 2016 but the art style is cool and the game is fun to play. Plus you can't get the OP burst rifles in the later games."
6596,"-Graphic 8/10
-Story 8/10
-Physics 6/10
-Gameplay 9/10
-Optimization 5/10
and I give for this game 8/10

Short introduction
You begin your trip just exit the bus, and choosing 1 of 4 playable chars in this game (every char has his unique ability and skills).
And the main target for those treasure hunters is to open and loot The Vault, but it won't be so easy.

Weapon Profiencies and how it works: you will have different bonus for each type of weapon what you use. (Its like bad version of Baddas rank bonuses in Bl2 or BLTPS)
In game challenges are good but only for earning EXP. 

Recomend this for people who like this kind of games or coop
most of DLC worth to buy


PROS
-Plot Story
-different chars, and each with unique skills
-weapon generator
-open world
-a lot of different treats what will wait for you.
-coop the reason for what this game is created as it is 
-when you have team there are not only more enemies with bigger health and better guns, they also drop better loot and spawn BADASS more often
-a lot of easter eggs


CONS
-sometimes in game generates item which can be purple or blue, but some ""green"" what you have in inventory can be more better.
-poor optimization
-dummy enemies"
6597,"The day I stop hearing ""Check me out I'm dancin', I'm dancin'!"" in my dreams is the day I will have died from starvation in front of this game."
6598,"The music, the atmosphere, the twisted humor, the loot, the shooting, the loot, the shooting. A bit repetitive but then again, that is the nature of loot-shooters. I didn't think it could be enjoyable, but I was wrong. When done correctly a loot-shooter can be really fun.

The story line in the game is good, it doesn't make the game repetitive so you do not get bored even though many of the missions follow the same basic principle, go to point a and shoot a bunch of bad guys, then a boss, then collect loot. Rinse and repeat.

You just need to try it out."
6599,刷刷还是很有乐趣的……待我赶快刷完开坑无主2……
6600,Still the best Borderlands out of all :D
6601,"Just nominated for the ""Test Of Time"" Steam Award, there's a charm to the dusty desperation of the original [i]Borderlands[/i] that rewards your return to its RPG and FPS mashup. Veterans of the sequel and presequel will find plenty more to explore in this franchise-establishing entry, while VaultHunters from way back when shouldn't hesitate to pop back in from when there were only four (yet outstandingly powerful) characters with playstyle-evolving stat improvements based on how you play, loot drops could happen anytime and some weapons nerfed in future games have gloriously decisive firepower in this one, and the planet Pandora turned from the wildwest chaos of lawlessness toward major disruption at what you'll do, from start of the story through its closing chapter in the final expansion. Years later, still recommended!"
6602,"prob best game
"
6603,awesome. Still true
6604,"Another timeless classic. Great atmosphere, cool story, lots of places to explore, and it keeps you on your toes. Ok, it has shooting, lots of shooting with lots and lots of different guns, but that part is not too bad. Highly recommended for this is the one that got me started on the series. :)

Even after so many years it is still fun, For enhanced fun have a look at the enhanced version. :)"
6605,A cool game.
6606,"So, I originally got this game for the 360, and have well over 100 hours playing either with my brothers or on my own, and I regret nothing. This is a fantastic game for people of all skill levels and experience. Through the random generation of guns, you can outfit your character to match your preferences and through the skill trees make yourself even more deadly and is yet another way to build your character to your play style. Tons of side quests if you want to wander that way, and a creative world filled with tons of people and things that want to kill you. I suggest reading the flavor text."
6607,"One of my favorite games of all time. Great gun-play,  great loot, great atmosphere, great in solo and in co-op, great DLC. Aside from feeling a little stiff in some areas, it still holds up to this day. Would highly recommend this to be anyone's first Borderlands game."
6608,9/10 废土风格完美，FPS+RPG领域的一枝独秀。
6609,"Prepare to hear the most annoying robot in gaming history. Shoot some bandits and kill the biggest monsters with the weirdest colorful guns, the funniest storyline and the best voice acting you can get in 1 game...and the best is you can still do this with your friends! :D"
6610,Love this game!
6611,ok
6612,Gotta love a great online / couch co-op game
6613,"I voted for this on the games that stand the test of time award because it does just that!
if you dont have a copy of borderlands get you one!"
6614,Bought it for the memories
6615,"True Blue classic game, hammered this bad boy on console in the years gone by. Great solo and even great with friends. sweet art style and the loot is all unique and different. 10/10 babyy"
6616,This is just one of those games that will have you coming back for more fun even eight years later.
6617,"I've had this game for Years on disk and decided to get the whole package on steam on sale, best idea ever.  can't tell how many times I've completed this game and still I just continue to come back for more. May never get tired of the gameplay, the comentary/back ground conversations, or the multiplayer. One of my all time favorite games. If you have a pulse, you should check it out. Cheers and keep up the great work."
6618,"It's priceless when you and your friends are searching for PANTS!

10/10"
6619,Why are you looking at a review for this game? It's Tried and True. nuff said.
6620,only reviewing for a badge
6621,most beat borderlands game ever
6622,get a double anarchy and the game is easy
6623,"Best start to a franchise ever, gimme dem perks, Steam!"
6624,Best Game ever. Built in Editor...................
6625,"The first and still the best of the Borderlands.  If you're coming to the series late, don't miss the beginning."
6626,This a game that will make you laugh over and over.  I have played it multiple times and still come back for more.
6627,"CL4P-
[spoiler]MOTHER F-ing[/spoiler]
TP."
6628,"An RPG, shooter and adventure game all combined. Perfect if you are gonna play with friends and get rare loot. Recomendable for playing solo too."
6629,this is most awesome
6630,"Can't kill Claptrap.

0/10"
6631,"Still my favorite of the Borderlands series. I have replayed the game many times and I'm sure I will when I have ""nothing else to play."" Has somewhat of a storyline, plenty of people and creatures to shoot. In addition it has a decent weapon and character level up system."
6632,Awesome game.
6633,Easy another 200 hours of fun
6634,amazing game to bad be so short aside the dlc zombies everything is awesome
6635,great game
6636,"Still looks good and plays great...

...and the ending is still awful..."
6637,"Borderlands is a great game. It has fun gunplay, with millions of weapons, thanks to its unique random generator. The story is simple, you are a vault Hunter, looking for an ancient vault said to contain riches beyond your wildest dreams. You start at the bottom, gaining the trust of the residents of fyrestone.

After this, you fight enemies, get better guns, fight more enemies and bosses, level up and the cycle begins again. It might sound repetitive and dull, and the ai isn't particularly challenging, but the weapon variation means you'll continue trying to get better guns, shields and grenade mods. There are elemental effects, which makes the obliteration of bandits even more fun.

At the start of the game, you are tasked with choosing a class. Although there isn't much variation in gameplay, they each have different special abilities, which you can upgrade using skill points as you level up. Brick (the beserker) has incredibly strong fists and punches them to death. Roland (the soldier) has a turret to help him. Mordecai (the Hunter) has bloodwing, a powerful bird who can get enemies whilst you are far away or behind cover. And Lilith (the siren) has a phasewalk ability, where she can travel into another dimension and get around the back of enemies.

Whilst the story isn't particularly unique, the art style and characters are, and the plethora of side missions keep you coming back for more. There is a lot of gore, and it makes it so satisfying. Once you finish the campaign and are done with your play through, you can select your second play through. You use your the same character as before, same weapons, but you can get more powerful weapons. The one liners and missions may not seem as fresh, but the enemies are tougher, and you have more to do, greatly extending your playtime.

For £4.99 with all dlc in a sale, it is an absolute steal, and a must have for your library."
6638,"Not as good as the second one, but still worth a try."
6639,"Great skills, great loot, great game - after all this time? Always. Amazing co-op experience as well."
6640,"As this game is not as much fun alone then it is with a group of friendos, it still had me wanting to come back to it PLENTY of times, even when my friends I played it with were offline. 
Guess I can just say that I was practically cheating on my friends with this game, since I'd play without them. 
And yet to this day, in 2016, almost 2017, I still play it here and there and I still find new guns I have never seen before.
MORAL OF THE STORY~ This is a great game, a great introduction to a great franchise, and one of my favorites."
6641,Bangin' Game
6642,An exceptional first game in a series that sadly became pretty poor. Play this instead of any other Borderlands game.
6643,Pretty cool weapon system and world building
6644,o comeso de umas das melhores series de jogos
6645,"i still love this game the most over the other borderlands titles
"
6646,Funny. Blood. Guns. And MORE BLOOD.
6647,Still best FPS-RPG ever released.
6648,After this game i pre-ordered every single game that came after it.
6649,"Guns, murderers and corrupted robots, I was made for this sh** BRO :D"
6650,"Great game, a must buy"
6651,"STRIP THE FLESH! SALT THE WOUNDS! NICE, NICE, NICE, NICE!!!

For those of you who don't speak Psycho:
PLAY THE GAME! LOOT THE GUNS! SEE WHERE THE AWESOME FRANCHISE STARTED!!!"
6652,An awesome game to play with friends!
6653,"Good game
Lot's guns"
6654,i really love this game
6655,"Graphic is a bit old and washed, story could have been a little longer (where's my playthrough 3?!!), DLCs could have been a bit better (no fast travlel!).
BUT
It's a absurdly fun, great-looking (if you are into Cel-Shading) and absolutely NOT a serious game.

And there's guns. GUNS, gazillion of them. If you are into looting - this is the game you don't want to miss.

As for the story... well, dark humor and outrageosly stupid (in a good way) chars will tell you a story full of murders, heroic deeds and at least one damsel in distress.

As i'm writing this, over 150 hours were played and i'm still loving this game.

PS. if you bought this game and didn't liked it, i've got two words for you, my friend: NO REFUNDS!"
6656,its like diablo... kill enemies and grab loot ... but with guns :)
6657,"Really fun game, especially when playing coop with friends. It can become rather easy later in the game, but you can increase the difficulty by letting the game think more people are playing than actually are."
6658,Just about the best loot grind there was back when the game came out. Great nps and fun in MP
6659,"Am enjoying my time with Bloodwing playing as Mordecai, before I replay Borderlands 2.
played BL2 before BL1, so I have to cherish every moment we have together.

Good boy Bloodwing, some one's getting a treat."
6660,Definitely worth the money!
6661,"very fun FPS-RPG that doesn't take itself seriously.
I recommend playing it with friends in co-op !"
6662,3 balls
6663," i like borderlands series, and this is my first love :)"
6664,Awesome game. You will find it hard to stop playing. Always wanting to do one more mission. One more weapon. One more level.
6665,I loved this game when it came out. I am really glad it gained popularity and sparked BL2!
6666,"Somehow, I keep coming back to this game over and over. Maybe the simplicity of this chapter draws me in."
6667,"Absolutely one of the best games out there. Endless hours of grinding fun for those challenges. Every single challenge... To the very last... No, I'm not obsessed. Shut up and go play!"
6668,I definitely recomend it.
6669,Just a great FPS game with a little bit of RPG.
6670,"This thing is just over-the-top crazy, and seriously avoids being serious. It's also surprisingly playable."
6671,10/10 can run over everything in sight and not get arrested
6672,Love this series!
6673,"Good Old Days... ;_;

<3 Borderlands <3"
6674,love it
6675,"One of my fave games, not alot of play time just yet but def worth the price, maybe even a bit more, long story from what I have seen from the first few missions.

Only annoying thing is the long distances you gotta walk until you can get a car.

Def recommend this game to all though, I have the 2nd one installing and soon getting the pre sequel to finish it all up.

Not starting 2nd until I finish this one though, duh.

I def recommend!"
6676,well i tried to play and it freezes up on me.. any solutions to fix for windows 8 if so thanks. but i played some of Borderlands two and i love it !!
6677,Just like call of duty... but with guns and a huge support for the Wounded Warriors program.
6678,"Great game! Loved the story and what it has to offer, but the DLC, The underome riot, um yeah it's a ♥♥♥♥ing joke."
6679,Very fun RPG-ish FPS. I've had a lot of fun with this game in and outside of LAN.
6680,Raskalio sam kampanju sa rodjakom nema bolje.
6681,"borderlands cannot start games general protection fault windos 10.
after i deleted the games form c driver and reinstall to D drive but it cant start games or lan games
"
6682,Great game only just started but good storyline and fun!
6683,"There ain't no rest for the wicked
Vault hunters don't work for free
There's guys to kill
And guns to loot
Pandora ain't got no trees

The game is a great mixture of first person shooting and role playing elements. There are four playable characters. Each has a unique play style. The game has a unique graphical style. The game has a ton of weapons, most of them randomly generated. The shooting is fun and fluid. The biggest problem with the game is that it can get a little repetitive. 

Recommended for anyone that likes fun and doesn`t demand realism from thier games."
6684,"Borderlands is the first game of the Borderlands trilogy and it's an ok start to the series. This FPS with RPG elements is a stupid and violent looter shooter, so if that's your thing, grab yourself a friend (or 3) and fight your way through the deserted, eponymous, cel shaded Borderlands of Pandora, quite honestly a shit hole of a planet, as one of four classes.

Pros:
-One playthrough (with all DLC except the arenas) can last up to 60 hours depending on how thorough you complete quests
-Playable in coop with up to 3 friends
-4 different classes with unique skills, each with 3 skill trees you can combine after your hearts content
-Effectively an endless amount of weapons with some juicy abilities
-Big and diverse world
-Action packed fights
-Graphics
-Humour

Cons:
-Some bugs and glitches
-Some quests may be repetitive
-Depending on your equipment there can be segments which are full of bullet sponges and tough to get through
-Story is pretty much non-interactive
-Quite some DLC
-Graphics
-Humour

Personal opinion:
Borderlands is an ok game as far as I'm concerned. If you're a diehard fan of the Borderlands series, then why don't you have it already? If you are looking for a good entry into the series, I'd recommend to start with Borderlands 2. Sure, there are some characters in Borderlands 2 that you would know a little bit more about if you played the first one, and some areas would be cool to go back to, but the second part is just way better rounded out and honestly, the narrative is not what makes you want to play a Borderlands game. Borderlands hasn't aged all that well, and it's not even all that old. If you can get it cheap, grab yourself a friend and play it, otherwise, there's not much harm in skipping this one. It's not bad, but it's not too great either, especially when there are two newer Borderlands games to choose from."
6685,"Nacházíte se planetě zvané Pandora a vaším úkolem je s doprovodem Guardian Angela a otravného robota zvaného CL4P-TP (""Klap-Trap"") najít tři časti klíče k bájnému Vaultu. Ale aby to také o něčem bylo, tak mezi lidmi, které na planetě potkáváte, je pár chamtivců, kteří by rádi použili klíč pro své vlastní potřeby a jsou odhodláni vás kvůli tomu zabít. Samozřejmě nejste na to všechno sami. Kromě Angela a CL4P-TPa poznáte i automechanika Scootera, prodejce zbraní Marcuse a několik dalších. Samotná porážka zla však závisí pouze na vás a případně i vašich přátelích...

Jedná se o RPG, které vás při dostatečném nadšení zabaví na několik desítek ba i stovek hodin."
6686,I love it!
6687,"I was told that BL is a good  game.Well..my personal experience is different.It is ''EH....'' game
It had enough framedrops,especially when i was near an explosion [might be something from my pc...]
+nice graphics
+Variety of weapons
+Variety of enemies
+Uncountable missions
==================
-Not very intresting story
-the sounds were a bit moudy
-you lose,sometimes,your ''fun''cause it reapets the same things

I recommend it."
6688,"This game has multiple classes, special graphic style and many secondary quests with pretty good main story.

1. Story
It is not complicated one but it keeps you going. It will definitely take you some time to get to the end of it. The big finale was pretty insteresting eventhough the last fight was very easy, although the boss looked cool. The main story has some twists, but nothing that surprising. It also had some awesome voiceovers, especially the robots :)

2. Graphic
Borderlands has definitely its own graphic style and even I played this game many years late, I still had no problems with the graphic quality. I had to get used to the style, but never had some major issues.

3. Gameplay
Alright. This one gets a little bit tricky. Some guns on some enemies acted weird and eventhough I hit 100% headshot, I didn't kill the enemy. The guns are pretty fun and it's nice that you have many options and can hold up to 4 guns at the same time. Also some other gears to put on later stage. Eventhough there is the car system and port system, there is going to be a lot of running. You can't go everywhere in your cart and shoot everything easy with it which I really liked because that would be just dumb. The gameplay itself could get sometimes repetetive and even intense because even with really good weapons and headshots it took a lot to kill the enemy and if there was more of them, well, then it was not pleasant. You get respawn though, but it cost you money. The money it cost is calculated on how much money you own at the moment which was nice. Also if you die you actually don't die right away and you get a chance to kill enemy which pops ""second wind"", basicly resurecting you on spot which was very handy. Although there was some weird things with some guns I enjoyed the gun play and the special class skill was also pretty cool.

4. Final words
Finishing this game took some time and I got sometimes a little bit bored, but it kept me going. Only thing what bothered me was that I had to clear some areas over and over again and a lot of running didn't help either. Nice touch is that you some enemies have different weak spots so you just dont go headshot everything. Story was decent and gameplay was enjoyable enough.

7/10 - Good game"
6689,Excellent game. You have to play all the Borderlands games to really appreciate the series but it's worth it. All the extra content is great too.
6690,"Good start, but gets repetative real fast. I played this alone, in the end I just wanted to know what was in the vault.
Spoiler alert
It was dissapointment"

One of my favorite games ever!"
6692,"I don't know if I'll ever go back and play this game again or not, simply because Borderlands 2 was so much more enjoyable to me in terms of story, jokes, characters, gun quality, gun brand differentiation, the main ""town,"" quest variety, graphics, art style, etc. That said, the original Borderlands is definitely a game i would recommend, either to people who already played more recent Borderlands games who are curious about the original, or to people who haven't played the newer titles in the series.

Long story short, this game is silly, funny, and fun. It's basically Diablo as a first person shooter on a wacky sci-fi dustball of a planet full of jokes and baddies to kill. I will warn you that if you're wanting to get this one for the sake of story, there is almost none. You're really better off just reading about it online, which would probably take 7 minutes or less to read anything important to the plot and about stuff that is mentioned in the later games."
6693,it's ok.
6694,"Overall it's an excellent game and you will most likely enjoy playing it. Ambient, graphics and gameplay are awesome. It could be a great game, but AI and loot system are flawed and can be fustrating."
6695,Like cookie clicker except more walking.
6696,"Pros:
- The variety of the weapons is REALLY nice
- The gameplay is nice, a few bugs here and there, but nothing that ruins the game.
- Good story and characters, you'll laugh alot playing it

The only bad side, is that for me, you can play for like... 2 hours and you will feel like you shooting the same enemies and exploring the same places."
6697,Great Game.  It's held up well due to it's cell shaded graphics.  I really like the Gun RPG niche that this game fills.  Max Level here I come!
6698,"It's a fun looter/shooter with a gazillion different weapons in all sorts of combinations. If that tagline doesn't attract you, you won't find much else here.

The cell-shaded graphics are mostly a preference thing, some love it, others hate it with a passion. There's plenty of humor and some genuinely interesting story elements, but that's not the main focus of this game.

All in all, a decent purchase, specially when you get the all-in package with a 75% discount (which happens about 3-4 times a year)."
6699,Who couldnt love borderlands for free? Even if payed for?!
6700,nice game
6701,Borderlands 2 is better
6702,"Let's take a look at Borderlands, what to say? Good game nice combination of co-op/rpg/fps game games that [b] PERSONALLY [/b] like. Game has a lot of variety of guns, random stats, random attachments, cool effects...
I could say a good game for long time and single player aswel that for me its great (im addicted to internet D:).
So in overall i say this game its great 8/10.
There are still some bugs but what i can say its an ""old game"" and that's why they made Borderlands 2"
6703,"With friends you can laugh with:  great.
Alone:  don't do it.
Buggy piece of shit sometimes too.
Awful AI."
6704,yeah its okay i guess
6705,Was gonna post a negative review because by the fourth playthrough I wasn't having as much fun anymore. Then I realized I was a spoiled asshole. 9/10
6706,"Hoarders like myself love this game, Would definitely recommend playing. Lots of time spent playing and all enjoyed"
6707,"While the ending is quite dissappointing, I enjoyed the storyline significantly more than borderlands 2 or 2.5. It's a pretty quality game for the most part."
6708,hey that's pretty good
6709,Very fun game with unique atmosphere and a lot of humour. The multiplayer option is very enjoyable and well made. I recommend it to all players who like casual shooting in wastelands.
6710,True masterpiece. Amen.
6711," I didn't like the graphics and this was a very poorly constructed game. It baffles me how this game got such a high reviews. However it made me want to play through the end so I am putting my thumbs up.

+) Though all the negative sides of this game I mentioned at the bottom, I did come across a strong gun and my skills helped my game play smoother.

-) I thought I was going to get used to the graphics but I coudln't I didn't like it when I began and now I am sick of it to be honest.
-) XP of lower level enemies go lower and lower making you not want to fight them. But they respawn again and again. They even come into the town making you waste bullets. When in lower level stage they could even break your shield and lower your hp.
-) Maps are poorly constructed. They should've at least had a ladder or something. I mean come on. Test your own game.
-) They make you go back to each dungeons for other side quests. When exploring is not encouraged since lower level enemies just don't give you xp this seems like irritating chores.
-) Loot is messed up. They should give optimized loots for your class but they just drop every possible items in the game and most of them, no, almost all of them have crappy quality. Even those from bosses are sloppy.
-) The bgm is cheap. Cartoonish games like this should at least have rock n rolling music to pump up the game play.
-) They should've made skills more powerful since guns, ammos and aiming is so poorly constructed.
-) I really don't know why they made car kills reduce xp when they encourage players to ride them most of the time."
6712,"This game has thought me so many good christian values, like ""shoot thy neighbour in the face"".

6715,First exposure to the art style of cell shading and it pulls it off flawlessly.

6717,AMAZIN
6718,"This game was one of those I was looking forward to playing for a long time. As a huge fan of the RPG genre, I was really interested in how it would work when mixed with a FPS. Let me tell you, I wasn't disappointed at all. The randomized gun creation system, the humor and the atmosphere all contribute to the immense fun factor. I wasn't able to appreciate the co-op because I have no friends who play this game (which is total shame), but even the single player alone was an experience. The expansions just make it even better (though some of the achievement fetch quests made me want to ragequit). After playing the sequel it does feel a bit more bland, but it's still an amazing game that you should pick up and see the mad world of Pandora yourself, for there is no rest for the wicked."
6719,i love it 10 out of 10
6720,"i only played one class for most part and beat the game one playthrough. did most of the dlcs except moxxi's. i did a different review for that one. anyways this was a very fun game did a lot of solo and coop with a friend. we died quite a few times and still we had a blast doing it. so not only were mobs difficult but fun to deal with. the music was great. the sayings were perfect as well. i really enjoyed the comedy of this game which led me to play the 2nd one. 


this one is worth picking up if you have never played it. its even better with 2-4 people."
6721,I can't get borderlands 1 to run on my pc i try and start it up and it shows me the borderlands red logo with the bandits ect on but my screen just gone blank and I have to control windows and escape out of the game and close it
6722,"Played Borderlands 2 GOTY first... bought after that everything else.
....
waited for free time, and started from scratch. 
borderlans 1.... if you dont have it, love crazy action games, good humor, dont think about it just buy it.

Great cartoon like graphics, superb voice acting , audio is great, humor is hilarious, and if that i not enough, i cant help you, you are beyond help :)
"
6723,"As with both the first and second Borderlands games, it starts out slow, but works its way up to non-stop action and shooting and killing. Unfortunately, there arent many fast travel locations for the DLC so much of the time is spent traveling rather than killing shit.

Bonus: features a capitalist Russian, a wannabe doctor, a species of midget humans that live off of ""purple juice,"" rewards you for exploration often involving improvised parkour/jumping/mashing spacebar (ex: loot boxes are often well-hidden out of sight)."
6724,"It needs quite some config tweaks to be playable, but once you have it set up, it still holds up nicely. Totally bonkers, over the top and sometimes hillarious characters and gameplay. Just the right game to pick up, if you want to have some dumb fun."
6725,FPS RPG what more can I say LOVE ALLLLL THE BORDERLANDS if only you dont lose heath wen falling like the second 1. Guns guns guns guns ow witch one man this one that one
6726,"Borderlands is a very fast paced multiplayer game that you can also rock solo in. It has a addicting loot system which pulls players into the after game grind of fighting bosses and doing the other 4 DLC. I had borderlands on the XBOX360 And have atleast 1,000 hours on it. I still play this game and keep replaying it. The story isn't that long or hard, and the characters in the game are loveable and have unique personalities. After the story missions, you have plent of side missions you can do in mid or after game. Oh yeah, and did I talk about the 87 BILLION GUNS!?!? No joke, this game has a lot of guns. You can choose a aray from 4 characters with 3 unique skill trees you can choose. They all have something unique about them which makes playing the game again after finishing it with another character is worth while. This is a great game and the community is great. The only problem i have with the game is that when your in fight for your life, you can't crawl around to find ennemys. And also health, ammo, and money, isn't a auto pick up which is really annoying. But other than that, This game is a jem. 9.9/10 would play many times again."
6727,This game is pretty badass.
6728,you want guns? well this might answer your problems
6729,"yo farming crawmeraxx, if you want some tasty loot or maybe even a pearl add me right now"
6730,"Summary:
Borderlands 1 is a compelling adventure, the like of which I have not had before. You begin the game on a alien world looking for a alien treasure. However as you adventure on you really get to understand what it would be like to live in a wasteland society. Something that gets me everytime I go through this game is right at the beginning a character named Marcus says "" I am sure we will be doing this again soon enough"". I know my game time on steam doesn't show it but after getting four maxed character on the playstation 3, then four maxed characters on the xbox 360, and finally coming back to play this game yet again on steam I understand what Marcus meant (Yes I bought this game three different times it is that good). I have played through and beat Borderlands 1, Borderlands 2, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel and Tales of the Borderlands. Borderands 1 is by far my favorite in the fanchise and is the only one I would highly  recommend to other consumers.

Pros
Excellent Combat
Unique Weapon Drop System
Amazing Co-Op (This game you can beat entirely through Co-Op, the only other Co-Op expeince I had that was this good was going through Halo(s) 1-3 with friends).
Great Story (Not alot of story elements though so you have to listen and pay attention for them)
Replayability 
Music (Simple but really helps with the game atmosphere)
Side Quests
Enteresting Characters
Cool Unique World

Cons
Class Balancing
Not alot of raid bosses (Personally that never bothered me)
A bit short of a game (This is corrected if you have the dlc)
Enemy Scaling and drops in Playthrough 2/2.5"
6731,"I don't quite like RPG games with too many quests.
Cmon I just want to finish the game.
Wait, don't tell me this game doesn't have any ending? God..."
6732,Great game that has hours of fun
6733,"Explosions. Lots of explosions. References to, have been used to a ridculous amount.
"
6734,Great Start for an amazing series. Play the others cause they are amazing as well.
6735,Fun
6736,good
6737,I absolutely adore this game! i have played it through like 6 times. I have never played the DLCs though. But it is on my to-do-list. The gameplay is awesome. The open-world is just so cool.. For me personally there is nothing negative about this game!
6738,"Borderlands is definitely a must-have for anyone who enjoys the FPS genre. I have played countless hours across many different platforms and this game has always brought out the best in our group. Borderlands has a unique feel and that carries throughout.. Fantastic dialogue and interesting quests will have you and your friends coming back for more. If you haven't picked it up yet or don't know where to start in the franchise, Borderlands will not disappoint."
6739,Awesome
6740,"Fantastic start to the series. I played it all the way through and am trying to find people to go back and play it co-op. This game started the franchise and even if you have played Borderlands 2 and the Pre-sequel, its still worth a go. Lots and lots of fun.

Also looks amazing on 2560 resolution."
6741,BADAAAAAAAAASS!/10
6742,"RPG meets FPS
instant classic
co-op"
6743,I absolutely adore this game. It was the first RPG style game I ever finished on a console and now I've played through it again on PC.
6744,"very great afterplay although it had its flaws even though the dlc came out and is enjoyable. I know this game came out in 2009 so I know there would be some flaws

- feels very bland after you beat playthrough 2 but otherwise i'm level 52 so I played the hell out of the game 
- needs to be more organized with the challenges (something borderlands 2 improved really well) and I wonder how your suposed to do all of the challenges

otherwise the game was really great hope to look foward to buying the dlcs and trying to complete more challenges"
6745,10/10 must have ...
6746,"I think I've started and restarted Borderlands about a dozen times since I first played it. I keep coming back to it because it's a solid game, but after a certain point it's so tedious that I don't want to play any longer. I'd first played it back before the first DLC came out, and I still haven't finished it.

Borderlands is a good FPS. The art style is unique, the shooting is great, the weapon types are varied, and the randomly generated enemies and weapons keep it (somewhat) fresh. There are many missions (ranging from ""kill this"", ""survive them"" to ""push this button and kill something else""). The HUD and UI are laid out well. The four characters and their upgrade paths play differently enough that you can get a lot of replayability. 

But...

Pandora is interesting and exciting. You get a backstory as you go along, if you're listening close enough. And you wonder what's being left out. Was it always such a s***hole? Or was it because the Dahl corporation released its convict labour when they pulled out? Because it looks like it's been falling apart for a very long time, and we're just the latest bad thing to happen to it.

But...

The characters are interesting. Their random banter fills in the void, and the mission text adds to the character of the world. The human enemies are varied, and so are the creatures. There's no one strategy that will get you through the game, you have to work at it, and see what works. Getting killed has a penalty (just money, really), but it doesn't slow down the game, and it is possible (at times) to get through an area by sheer attrition (though not in arenas and not against boss creatures).

But at some point, it gets tedious.

I hesitate to call it ""backtracking"" because it's a pretty open world (with a definite direction as you move from area to area), but enemies respawn when you travel back through an area that you've visited before. And I'm sure it's okay for folks wanting to ground out a few more levels, but it leaves me without a sense of accomplishment, because as soon as I move on, the bad guys will be back. I'll rush through areas and then rush back because I don't want to fight the same fight so soon after. 

In spite of that, I still come back to Borderlands, because it is a good game, and I keep wanting to see if I can find that next gun or shield, and if they'll be better than what I have now.

Would I recommend it? Yes, I would. Borderlands is a solid shooter, and I expect it's a lot more fun for those who enjoy co-op (unlike me). And it's good fun even when you're on your own."
6747,this game is great when you want to feed that need to kill and raid without going to jail.
6748,"Fell in love with Borderlands 2 and had to come back and play the original. Very well done, humor, guns, and a fantastic campaign that isn't too grindy."
6749,I love it alot.
6750,booty
6751,"This game is fairly decent, but falls short on the key functions that make up a First-Person Shooter great. First off, the gameplay seems unbalanced. You will fight against hordes of easy targets, and then reach your destination only to fight a monster with the combined health of about 30x your own. Secondly, the methods of getting around leave much to be desired. The car you are given is fairly terrible when it comes to handling, and it is only avaliable at a few towns of the many that you visit. Walking takes more time that I would expect from what is supposed to be a high-octane game, and the journey is riddled with easy but annoying enemies.

I would give this game a 6/10, but I wouldn't recommend it for the price the developers charge.


"
6752,"After spending over 100 hours both on PC and PS3, I can definitely call this game one of the most fun and addicting games I've ever played. While having spent most of my time playing solo, the co-op experience is both satisfying and a blast to go through. Aside from fighting over certain loot drops! I'd reccomend this game to anyone."
6753,G.O.A.T.
6754,It's a gearbox classic. enough said.
6755,"BEST GAME EVER!!! storyline kinda sucks a little but the gameplay, guns, the characters, funny ass sayings and the looks of it just makes this game so damn great and even after all these years i still perfer this game over bld2 or the pre sequal. a must buy for every borderlands fan <3"
6756,"This game is so awesome, Long storyline and good tutorials"
6757,"Absolutely incredible game. Love it. Easy controls, great gameplay, graphically superb. The game content itself will keep you glued for hours, it's not another '20hrs and finish' generic FPS. Artistically very akin to Tank Girl, and very clever with it's pop culture references/easter eggs. The boss 'Mad Mel' for example. I actually prefer to this Borderlands 2; the humour in this game is a bit more subtle and not just juvenile fart jokes made for dumb American stoner kids. There are some, I'm not saying there aren't, but this game tones it down a little and makes for a better experience imo."
6758,"I really enjoyed borderlands, I spent a lot more time on my PS play through but never the less this game deserves a great review!"
6759,"I played borderlands 2 first and so playing this was only good because of the characters. The only difference between borderlands and 2 is the characters, weapon improvements, and control/ui improvments. 2 is a much better game even though it basicly copies the exact same storyline. But if you are like me and my friends and have played through 2 multiple times this is something slightly different to play through and enjoy."
6760,"[h1] Has Borderlands recently caught your interest or gone on sale for a cheap price and you are now debating on buying it? Hopefully this review will serve to better help craft your decision! [/h1]

I'll try and avoid dragging on unnecessarily, while still being detailed.

[b] Summary [/b]
Borderlands is the first game in its franchise, being released three years before Borderlands 2 and five years before Borderlands: The Pre Sequel. This is a ""Loot-N-Shoot"" game, which means that you will be killing enemies, picking up loot, then discarding 95% of that loot because it is useless; however, the small portion of weapons, grenades, shields, and  class mods that you will pick up can and will replace your old gear and provide you with a whole new mix of style to the gameplay.

[b] Is It Worth ""x"" Money? [/b]
It's a game that is, as of now, seven years old. Despite that, it is still being sold for $20 on the steam store, which groups it together with other old games that are still asking for more money than they should be (AKA: the entire Call of Duty franchise). Is it worth full price? I can't help there, because I never buy games unless they are on sale, so sorry. For 5-10$? YES. Definitely worth picking it up due to the amount of fun and content it provides. It goes on sale on steam fairly often, but remember: there are still sites like ""IsThereAnyDeal"" that will allow you to search through many other legitimate steam key sellers that may be selling the game for 80% off at any given time.

[b] How Long Is It? How Much Content Is There Truly? [/b]
Well, the length of the game varies depending on the class you choose. There are four unique characters to choose from, which allow for multiple varied playstyles. There's Brick, who specializes in spamming melee attacks (have not played as), Mordecai, who can unleash a flying chicken to kill enemies for him (have not played as), Roland, who can unleash a sentry to kill enemies for him (level 36), and Lilith, who can phase in and out of reality, allowing her to go invisible for a few seconds, get behind the enemy of choice, and then cram her fist through their chest, causing an explosion of acid, fire, and lightning all at once (level 69).

It took me 15~ hours to finish normal mode as Roland, 8~ hours to finish normal mode as Lilith, and 23~ hours to finish the game as Lilith. What is normal mode and what is the rest of the game that took 15 hours to finish?

[u] Normal Mode: [/u] [i] The first playthrough of the game. Enemies do not scale to your level, you will finish the game at level 36~ depending on how many side quests you choose to complete. [/i]

[u] Playthrough 2 [/u] [i] The second playthrough of the game, which is essentially replaying the entire game, side quests/main quests and all, but keeping all your gear and skills from the previous playthrough. The level cap is increased to 69 and you will need to play the DLC in order to get your level boosted that high. All enemies scale to your level upon entering the final boss, EXCEPT GENERAL KNOXX DLC ENEMIES!!! [/i]

The difference between Roland and Lilith is that Lilith is constantly sprinting around, lighting up her enemies and regaining health as a direct result of killing them. Roland, on the other hand, is, as far as I can tell, meant for placing down your shield and taking a more relaxed approach (using cover). 

Anyways, the game has a TON of content and choosing to get all four characters to level 69 could result in a far greater playtime than I have accumilated (42 hours).

[b] How's The Story? [/b]
Non-existent. The dialogue-heavy Borderlands 2 is the complete opposite of Borderlands 1, where almost all of the ""story"" will be supplied to you via reading. This game is meant to be played like a fast paced FPS akin to DOOM and Shadow Warrior, so slogging back to the poorly-developed characters and redeeming quests to hear their repetitive one sentence long ""conversation"" is one of the worst parts of the game. If you are in need for a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat or even slightly interested at all, look elsewhere. This game has NONE.

Side note: The DLCs have slightly better stories, but not enough to really make a difference in my opinion.

[b] Any Humor? [/b]
Barely. The comedy in this game boils down to a few humorous sections in the DLCs, which is where Borderlands 2 got the idea and drastically expanded upon it.

[b] Speaking Of DLC, How Is It? [/b]
Terrible. Truly vile. The Moxxxi's Underdome DLC needs to be downright avoided, if not deleted from the game entirely. It is just a freakishly long arena mode, slogging through the same enemies for hours. The zombie and claptrap DLC are regarded as being pretty good, but I honestly felt sick playing through them. It was an amazing feeling to finish both of them and get back into the main game. The final DLC, General Knoxx, I don't have any idea if it is good or not because for some INSANE REASON, enemies in that DLC do not scale to your level unless you finish it.

That's right. You read that right. You have to beat the DLC first, being however many levels above it (therefore one shotting every enemy) and THEN you unlock enemy scaling. LOL.

On the brightside, the Claptrap and Knoxx DLC raise your level cap, so there's atleast some upside to them.

[b] HOW TO MAKE IT FUN! [/b]
What do you mean ""how to make it fun""? Well, here's where my opinion will cross the line and upset the die-hard fans of this game: it is boring. BUT WAIT: you can fix that.

I originally beat it as Roland, like I already said, and I felt repulsed by this game when I finished it. From the repetitive quests (all fetch quests or ""kill this"" quests) to the anticlimactic boss fight: [spoiler] GIANT OCTOPUS EXPLODES OUT OF A ROCK BUT OOPS ITS EASIER THAN THE MINIBOSSES YOU FIGHT EARLIER IN THE GAME! AND IT DROPS NO LOOT [/spoiler], I did not have anything good to say about this game. 

Thankfully, I decided to give it another chance a few weeks after. First, I switched my class to Lilith, which was a much more engaging and overall fun playstyle. Then, here's the key thing, I turned on Pandora. What? Sounds simple, but that's what made this game for me. The music in this game is boring and forgettable, mainly providing you with the occational banjo string while fighting an onslaught of enemies. Turn that literal garbage off and boot up pandora, because it's time to listen to exciting and adrenaline-pumping music that will turn this game from boring to fun instantly.

""That's it?"" Yep. That is my advice for making this game a better experience for you. You won't be missing out on any funny or interesting dialogue, because the story is missing from the game, and you won't be drowning out blood-rushing ingame music either: because banjos are about as exciting as cardboard.

[b] But How Does It Compare To Borderlands 2? [/b]
Borderlands 2 has better graphics, an actual story (and an amazing one at that), funny content, even more guns, the aspect of farming (which is practically missing from this game - excluding killing the raid boss and farming chests), oustanding DLC, more varied enemy types, better character classes, better sounds and music, better pacing and excitement, and lastly: more content and amount of fun. That probably just turned you off from the original, because you may be asking yourself why you'd even bother getting it if the sequel is better in every way. But the thing is...

[h1] Don't play this game trying to compare it to it's sequels. Don't stand it up and nitpick all the things it does worse. Enjoy Borderlands for what it is and not what you WANT it to be. If you can get past all of that, then you have yourself a fantastic game. [/h1]"
6761,"I may only have 11 hours, but by god i love this game, i used to play this on xbox 360 with my friends and it was the best damn game ever back then. i love this game and always will, i couldnt have better feelings towards a game, it has that oldschool feel to an rpg. if your reading this review and dont have the game, couldnt leave a better upvote for it, (in other words buy it its amazing and you wont regret it)"
6762,"Great game....Unfortunately, I only have a Mac, so I can't even play it off of Steam....When is Steam going to put in a Mac port of this game?"
6763,"THAT. IS. BADASS, AS. *UCK."
6764,Im so happy they made this game either for one player of 4 on or offline. This game will go down in the history books because of its awesomness. If you hanvent played it you are missing out.
6765,"Borderlands is a fun, fairly relaxing (at least to me) FPSRPG. Doesn't take long to complete, but doesn't feel too short either. Worth the investment for anyone looking for a good game to play casually."
6766,just plain awful.
6767,Pretty fun 4 player co op experience. Has it's own character and charm. You can shoot things and they drop guns
6768,"Borderlands is one of the best games ever made. A first-person shooter with RPG elements is the best game genre you can get. Buy this game, play it once, twice or thrice from the beginning to the end, and I'll promise that you'll still be talking about it once retired. Cheers!"
6769,"Great game, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who likes RPGs, FPS, and crude humor."
6770,8/10 for co-op gameplay
6771,A Giant chocolate icecream with Tnt and C4 in complement. I think it's a good picture of this great game.
6772,"It's alright playing solo ,but I think its better with friends 

[spoiler] I'm a loner so I don't have friends to play with [/spoiler]"
6773,The best entry in the series in my opinion and has the best DLC.
6774,"Bite Size Review - Borderlands

The Good:
+The gameplay is solid, the process of getting new guns with cool attributes is addicting
+Art style still holds up, even if the animations can be a bit stiff
+Plenty of stuff to do, a lot of quests and enemies to shoot
+Different classes to play and try out
+High Quality

The Bad:
-Quests can sometimes be ""get 100 items from fallen enemies"", can be a bit tedious, but they are not the main story quests which is good
-Other than the main story quests, most other quests are not that interesting (no spoken lines)
-Enemies fall into two types - those that are numerous and pop easy, and those that are bullet sponges, not that interesting


The Verdict:
By now most people should know what Borderlands is. This game is really good, it's rough in some spots but the good really does out way the bad with this game. If you are looking for a better game though, Borderlands 2 is technically better in every way, but this game started it all, so I highly recommend it. It's fun, there is a tone to do, and you can't go wrong with this game.
"
6775,"Borderlands will always be a classic, and I will always remember how excited I was to first start playing this game back on my 360 in '09. 7 years later (and on a far better console), the game holds up and brings me back (even if it was 7 years ago). This game is definitely not perfect, but is still very fun and can be highly addicting as well. The game doesn't seem to have aged a bit, and I would recommend this game to almost anybody, as the Borderlands franchise as a whole is phenomenal."
6776,Best game in the series IMO. Yes everyone rides borderlands 2 but I loved how you can literally find a gun at level 15 and keep using that shit into playthrough 2 not like in borderlands 2 where you constantly swap equipment out every 1-2 levels. Pumped many hours on ps3 hope to do the same here. Getting the mujltiplayer to work can be a pain in the ass but when you finally get it. Its awesome as fuck. Bloodwing forever.
6777,"Through ethnographic research in a high school setting, CJ Pascoe examines how American high school boys use the term fag. Pascoe's work suggests that boys in high school use the fag epithet as a way to assert their own masculinity, by claiming that another boy is less masculine; this, in their eyes, makes him a fag, and its usage suggests that it is less about sexual orientation and more about gender. One-third of the boys in Pascoe's study claimed that they would not call a homosexual peer a fag; fag is used in this setting as a form of gender policing, in which boys ridicule others who fail at masculinity, heterosexual prowess, or strength. Because boys do not want to be labeled a fag, they hurl the insult at another person. The fag identity does not constitute a static identity attached to the boy receiving the insult. Rather, fag is a fluid identity that boys strive to avoid, often by naming another as the fag. As Pascoe asserts, ""[the fag identity] is fluid enough that boys police their behaviors out of fear of having the fag identity permanently adhere and definitive enough so that boys recognize a fag behavior and strive to avoid it"". Pascoe's study reports that gender policing is most common among white boys, while black boys are more concerned with ""acting"" appropriately black. The black youth in Pascoe's study often ridiculed one another for ""acting white"", and did not express gender policing to the same degree as white boys."
6778,"I realy love this game and the franchise and it is astronomicaly better than the 3 borderlands in my honest opinion.

very good shooter for when it came out (not saying its bad)

amazing dlc and awesome weapons and gear

love the references they are clever and funny

very good gameplay

and the use of elements like fire against flesh enemies is a very good detail

some flaws are 

in my opinion it is hard to get mods and down load dlc for the game

overall it is an amazing game and if you like fps than you will definitely recomend bying it and some of the other games.seriously buy it it is worth the money"
6779,"Pros : Epic RPG elements, good story, good characters, good weapons, cool loot(...)
Cons : Claptrap, this character is insanely annoying mainly when Talking about new missions every 5 seconds"
6780,"Played this a whole lot back in the day. Sometimes still feels better than BL2, even. Shooting, roleplaying, co-op, guns and lots more guns, it's a great game."
6781,"AMAZING! Verrrryyy good game...Borderlands... game from The best series in the world.
10/10"
6782,A+ co-op game.
6783,"going back into this game after playing Borderlands 2 for a long time makes me feel getting Loot was more based rather than actual story progresion, and it shows. But still I love this game."
6784,"I bought this game after playing ""Tales of the Borderlands"", which I totally love. Reading all the good reviews, I was really looking forward to playing more in the Borderlands world.

Honestly, I was very disappointed. They set up a good mood, the game techniques work, though I'm not much of a friend of a ""respawn"" system - basically takes the tension out of the game, because you can never *really* lose.

But most of all, I was disappointed with the storytelling. Yes, I know, it's a shooter. If you buy this game just to buy a fun shooter, this probably is for you. But if you like games that really catch you, like for example Fallout 3 did, then this isn't the game for you.

I have totally no attachment to my own character, nor to any other. I'm doing the missions because there's nothing else to do, not because I have any real reason to do it. I played the game for two or three hours, then I was so bored that I quit it - and don't think I'll get back to it.

If you think about Borderlands because you've played Tales of the Borderlands - don't waste your money."
6785,"I like this game but I feel like there is a lot of hype around the loot and FPS elements. Inventory management is tedious (tediore?) at times, The bosses seemed WAY too easy  and the biggest challenges I faced were in the arenas. At times the distance to travel to an objective without a vehicle just seemed to be another way to waste your time. Fun game, lots of loot, not much else going for it."
6786,"""Directive one: Protect humanity! Directive two: Obey Jack at all costs. Directive three: Dance!"" Hahaha I love Claptraps! <3"
6787,When is Borderlands 3 going to be released?
6788,"Great game, fun, and humorous. I hate that this one is not on Linux, but 2 and presequel are available on Linux! They all are great, although I do feel there are many similarities between them all. Feels almost like I'm playing the same game. I do like all of them though. Love all the guns, items, etc."
6789,"Love it! So addicting, i love exploring beautiful world in borderlands. 8.5/10"
6790,"You'll spend most of the time killing cute robots hoping they drop panties. Just saying.
Amazing, sexy game though."
6791,A great game to buy and play with friends or alone.
6792,It's Borderlands. I picked it up again because it's Borderlands. I will continually play it over the years because it's Borderlands.... BORDERLANDS.
6793,A lot like Borderlands 2 except ever so slightly worse. 9/10.
6794,"Great game,crappy graphics easily fixable with mods tho..
Try to get GOTY edition on sale worth the money...."
6795,"A modern classic in the shooter genre. The Diablo 3 RNG style RPG elements lightly sprinked over what is a well-made shooter. Highly recommended, 11/10 would Brick-punch midgets again."
6796,"[h1]Imagine...[/h1] 

[b]Fallout: New Vegas[/b] without the talking.
[b]Fallout: New Vegas[/b] with more guns.
[b]Telltale Games[/b] with better graphics and sound.
[b]Telltale Games[/b] where you can go where ever you want.

And you got Borderlands. 
"
6797,nice game
6798,THIS SHIT IS DOPE
6799,"I like this game, it is fun to play. My favortite caracter is Lilith, i really like her powers. There is some bugs, but not enough to make it unplayable. For exemple, when i played with my boyfriend, sometime i would loose guns when reconnecting with the server after a moment. And I didn't really enjoy the main story like in borderlands 2. The story is not so great, it lacks depht. I find that the dlc of borderlands have better stories than the main story. Claptrap's new robot revolution, The secret armory of General Knoxx and The zombie island of Dr.Ned are dlc that i highly recommend. The dlc are totally worth it."
6800,"I remember playing this when it first came out on my Xbox, and it was pretty good, many years have passed with the famed sequal, Borderlands 2, and The Pre Sequal, until I decided to visit the game on my new PC. Borderlands brings back great memories, and I can easily argue that it is still one of the best games that I've played to date."
6801,"Shots, blood, cars, blood, missions, blood, funny dialoge, blood, kinnda 4th wall interaction (kinda!), missions, bloody missions, quests, cool weapons, SHOTGUNS!, missions, ROCKET LAUCNER!, missions...

This and a lot of missions (yea, a lot) is what waits for you on this game! 

Summerge on a bloody war dealed in Pandora, the home of the ""Chamber"" a place with treasoures with uncalculable value and, of course! A lot of usless people who is standing randomly @ the map waiting for some kind of ""heroe"" who comes to save them from the Skags!

Damn usless NPC..."
6802,What Destiny wanted to be.
6803,Very good game to play with friends and you'll enjoy tf out of it. Has a lot of replayability.
6804,Just like Trump and his wall.
6805,Get some friends and have fun. Play alone an be bored out of your mind.
6806,"Good graphics and animations; excellent weapon's choice BUT the game is totally ruined by these 2 plagues:
1) the continuous, awful, respawn of all enemies including Bosses: it is not only unreal, but also horrible because you lose a lot of time killing the same guys you have just killed 10 minutes ago! (-4/10 to the final rank of the game, for me);
2) the approximate quest indicators on map (sometimes, they are well done; other times, the markers are totally out of the real zone where you have to go): another time, this causes a huge waste of time while playing. (-2/10 to the final rank, for me).

The result is that a potentially funny game becomes boring, because of its slowness and repetitiveness. 

My final rank: 2/10 (it could have been 8/10, without these 2 terrible mistakes about the gameplay)."
6807,"Very nice game, fun to play with friends, i especially like the missions with finding stuff, and the clap-traps are really cute :)))"
6808,"I played this game everyday for 3 months after reluctantly buying it.

Pros

Huge sandbox world
Cartoony style graphics show rich detail
Many many missions both main and side
Awesome story
Cool take on a shooter with rpg character leveling abilities
Great DLC

Cons

Not much customization
Enemies employ little to no tactics, basically stand there and get shot
Really easy, perhaps a bit more challenge 
Jobs can be repetitive, a lot of fetching
450+ hours in and Crawmerax has yet to give me a pearl gun.  bastard."
6809,7/10
6810,"Amazing game, better than the second in my opinion"
6811,"Best RPG with FPS that I've played. Everything is really nice the skills, characters, history, multiplayer, weapons, car's combat and mechanics about elemental weapons and the skills tree that helps each class to use an unique weapom build. Like me, i used hunter as a high critical damage on sniper and pistol. Recommend to everyone that likes fps and rpg in one game"
6812,Play with friends or get bored simulator.
6813,"Shoot things in the face. Sort through bewildering amounts of loot. Ass about town selling loot and looking at even more loot. It was the biggest and best random weapon simulator on the market, a great deal of fun to play with friends, but completely forgettable. Like, literally, I have no recollection what the game was about (there were a lot of deserts), who was in it, or what kind of weapons I favoured.

I still recommend it though. Especially if you have friends.

7/10"
6814,"Salted many wounds. 


:D


10/10 would play again"
6815,"after a few atempts of playing this game on consoles and sequals and really not getting it, I finally got the apeal.
I went into this game years ago with a mindset of fps games being liner games with very little difficulty, and while you can call me a stupid plep or whatever this was indeed a game that was not ment for that kind of gamer.

 Borderlands is a game with somewhat difficult shooting on the surfice, rpg elements to pace the game, and what I believe to be at the core of it a diablo like loot system. while it may be a bit odd at first to someone not quite knowing what to expect, and a rather boring intro where you get your hand held and are restiricted for somewhat good reason it soon starts to open up and slowly turns into its own uniqe brand of shooter that feels very open and different.

this game also has a fair amount content with a rather long rin time
-4 very distinct classes
-lots of sidequests
-rather bare bones upgade tree
-random loot system ""LOTS OF GUNS""

and while there are many things to love about the game there are also a few things that might get on your nerves after some time of playing it
-bizzare car controls
-some bad feeling guns
-constently changing difficulty curves and much more
-great setup and world, shit story

This is a game I ultimately reccomend because of the open ended nature of the game and the rewarding loot and progression in the game
"
6816,"Just a bit lazy to write a full review, but just a few good points about Borderlands.

+Gotta love the humor in the game, great stuff with mister claptrap
+Good price in the Steam store
+Good DLC that adds a nice chunk of content to the game again
+Nice coop mode to play with your friends and buds
+Good story line
+Nice music
+Enough replayability

Borderlands deserves to be classes into the category of OLD and GOLD where you just get GREAT VALUE for your money."
6817,"harambe
"
6818,"For a stand alone game it is great.
In comparison to the 2nd in the series which I have played numerous times at this point....

Well altho I like the combat of number 1 better 2 did a WAY better job at story telling and dialogue in general.

So far I spend about 4 hours just doing fetch quests kill this or grab that.
And as for story there is little to nothing out there so far.

Graphics are quite similair altho 1 doesn't have the sweet effects that 2 has.

All and all not a bad game.
In fact I might actually enjoy it just a bit more then 2 tho story and humor is a little lacking.
I would say grab a friend and just enjoy questing lvling and shooting waves of enemies."
6819,"Borderlands is pretty fun, with a lot of grinding that doesn't feel like grinding. It does live up to the infamous anticlimatic end, but is a pretty fun play otherwise."
6820,looking for players online but  cant seem to find one game on borderlands.
6821,"This product just did not impress me. I found the gameplay to be pretty lame, repetitive, and un interesting. I have not finished the story but I plan to only because im interested in how the game will end. But other than that I have found this game making me regret spending that 10 dollars on buying it. Just not totally worth it."
6822,Love this game! It perfectly blend my two favorite game genres(RPG/FPS) and adds great moments of comedy throught to really break up the constant action
6823,Randy Pitchford is a hack.
6824,"This game is very good as a multiplayer game, a little boring a repetative when playing alone. I recommend this game if you plan on playing with friends or online."
6825,"Okay, most of this game time is from letting a friend's girlfriend play Borderlands on my computer (which at the time was semi-beastly a machine). Never came close to beating Borderlands myself, but I remember enjoying it enough, though not thinking it was particularly amazing or great. At this point, it's more worth playing the sequel than this one, unless you really like this Action RPG/FPS style game and love the story.

7.5/10"
6826,"You have to play through it atleast once in your lifetime, great story."
6827,"Very goosh. 
A patch for FOV fix and upgraded graphics would be nice"
6828,"Personal Rating: Wasted Potential
Classic Rating: ★★✬☆☆

Yes, negative. This review is for Single Player mode, but it probably fits for Co-op too.

* Respawning mechanism is broken. You're taken back to nearest base and have to basically start your quest from the beginning. Beasts and bandits respawn too, prepare to kill same enemies countless times.

* Saving game mechanism is awful. Mostly as I said earlier, you do respawn, you cannot save your progress. So yeah, when you die or start another match, you are being ""teleported"" into the game (that alone makes me laugh) and it's totally unrealistic, I don't even know if there's an explanation to that. I'm used to think that when I die in game, I have to ""go back"" by loading a previous saved game and continue from there, trying to move further and not to die again: Borderlands somehow managed to break all common (gaming) ground with their silly respawnings.

I can't say I'm not enjoying Borderlands at all, but it doesn't match my style and playing habits: I'm not used to play 2 hours straight to get to the point where I am finally ""safe"" and can quit the game - I want to play when I can and stop when I need to. This is no MMO, Jesus."
6829,"Do you like guns? Who am I kidding, you like guns. I like guns. Everyone likes guns. This game has guns. Lots of guns. Get the game, get the guns. 

Guns."
6830,"Great idea, bad AI, unsatisfying story, and pointless characters. Found it very boring to fight the AI and often times frustratingly stupid. Also, it can dodge sniper fire. Literally will be standing there motionless, then ducks right when you pull the trigger.

I played a lot in the past before I connected it with Steam. It was great... the week it came out but it was hard to beat the game because it wasn't giving me what I had expected. By the time I was done with the game, I found myself farming the trash mob (skags) because they were the only somewhat entertaining enemy, found at every level, and I was hoping to deck out my character before putting it down. The world feels open at first, until you take a step back to see a bigger picture of the landscape. The game is rather linear as well. You find yourself doing multiple quests in the same locations that are often just circular tracks and going back to locations is pointless. Almost all the loot is trash but forces you to look at it all because the gun you have has been in your hand for more than a few levels; turning into a pea shooter. Killing a boss has no guarrantee of a good drop. I found all my new guns from trash mobs or hidden crates.

If you got a buddy and you are desperate for a game that is on sale, sure. Otherwise, I would say to look elsewhere. There is little replay value because the story is not something to hear more than once, the missions are dull, the world gets old fast, and all the characters play pretty much the same. You shoot guns, other characters shoot guns differently."
6831,"In Borderlands, you shoot and loot your way across the planet.  You will take on missions whose real purpose will not always be clear, things will happen, and the story will progress in the background.  Mostly, you'll be shooting things and hoping they drop something good, while building XP and upgrading your character skills.  The DLC provides more coherent stories with clearer antagonists and actual plots.  Lack of coherent meaning and extremely sparse fast travel stations makes me wonder how the franchise survived its first entry into the market, but the sequels are excellent so I'm glad it did.  If you're a fan of the franchise, this one is worth playing for the additional background and the DLC was actually good, but otherwise I would say skip it and start with Borderlands 2."
6832,"Spent countless hours playing this great game. As advertised, there are literally a gazillion different weapons you can find in chests or dropped by an enemy you just, uh, dropped. Best game in the franchise IMO."
6833,"This review is mostly to set the record straight. So, apparently for the past two weeks I've played this game for a whopping 125 hours,  the last 40 of which happened even when Steam and my computer were shut down. Before that every moment Steam was launched counted towards time played Borderlands. All in all a pretty annoying playtime bug. So this is not a serious review, just to get the facts straight before people become concerned.

As game itself goes, it's Borderlands, you know? 9/10"
6834,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
6835,"first borderlands is the best one, before the randomly generated humour completely took over.

this game also has the best drops, legendaries are like 1/20 drops, it's ruck.

anyway 9/10 game with one point off just because of some annoying glitches"
6836,"Horrible combat system and game-breaking glitches. I found often an item would be through a wall, or enemies cripted to fight to conitinue the game would no appear. To top that all off, the levels system is crap, leaving you with lower weapons and options then your enemies. Fighting even one level above you at level 29 is nearly impossible. Only get this game if it is on sale, or there is nothing better arond."
6837,Great game
6838,"Really beutiful story,great graphics and really good dlc :P I can easily say that is REALLY close to the perfection of Borderlands 2 :P xD"
6839,"Before all of my good weapons disappeared, it was fun.




















FUCK GLITCHES!"
6840,"I let a Midget Psycho follow me into New Haven and kept it with me through the map quests. I still miss the little fella.

Also, this should totally win the “WHOOOAAAAAAA, DUDE!” award. If you finished the game, you'll know what I mean. Heh."
6841,Easily one of my favorite games of all time.
6842,"Regardless of your favorite genre, BUY IT !!! and love it <3"
6843,"If Mad Max was a comic book hero with mutant powers.. she'd be a siren

Brilliant. Highly original comic-FPS with RPG factors and comedy. Heaps of content with the GOTY version, this is a large game. The gun stats will sharpen your math. If your no number cruncher, keep a calculator handy if you want the best possible loadout, it can get technical.

The Borderlands games are honestly a lot of fun to play, this one included. They're also fairly simple to perfect (besides Moxxi's Underdome, seriously fuck that shit.) 

Having started with BL2, It was slightly jarring when I noticed the extreme downgrade in graphical elements. Everything looked much more primitive (which does make sense since it was released earlier.) Saying that, I can't be too harsh about that. 

Probably the worst things in this game are the extreme amount of backtracking in order to complete all the missions, the mandatory order of side missions, and several of the DLCs. 

The mandatory order of side missions: To put it short and sweet, in order to not get your ass handed to you, you have to follow the missions that match your level (at least if you'rs playing casually) in order to establish a steady incline of XP. 

Moxxi's Underdome DLC: Jesus christ, who thought this would be a good idea? The short rounds (5 rounds, 5 waves each for three colosseums) are fine and only get slightly repetitive. But the 20 round colosseum are fucking riddiculous. Just for good measure, the Waves are as follows (from Wave 1 to 5:) Starter Wave (EZPZ Couple Bandits/Lunatics), Gun Wave (A lot more Bandits), Horde Wave (20-30 Lunatics coming at you at once means rocket launchers are your best friend), Badass Wave (Same as Gun Wave just with more Badasses), and Boss Wave (You'll encounter random bosses you've encountered thoroughout the game and usually 2-3 grunts).) Eventually, I just had to slap on an unbreakable shield via save editor, give myself an extremely powerful shotgun, and grind mindlessly.  Eace round taking me around a minute and a half, 5 rounds per wave places that around 2.5 hours. Keep in mind there are 3 of these ""Challenges"" so 7.5 hours in total of midlessly running around and shooting randomly spawning bandits and lunatics. Now, you might be thinking, ""Don't you get something for beating these challenges?"" Well, yes you do! You get some lackluster weopons that if you're taking on the Underdome in the first place are going to be pointless since they're so weak. Not great.  

Claptrap's Robolution DLC:
Honestly, pretty enjoyable dlc. I thought it was very supising how they included the final bosses from all of the story based DLCs (i.e General Knoxx-Trap, Commandant Steele-Trap, and Dr. Ned-Trap.) The only problem with this DLC only matters to you if you care about the achivements. The grinding agains all the claptraps for the collectables. Ultimately, you can sit in a corner against MINAC (Mega Interplanetary Ninja Assassin Claptrap) and let him spawn countless of the suicide claptraps AFK over night. It still took me at least two full sleepin periods to collect all the items. 

Overall (without DLC): 9/10
Overall (with DLC): 7/10"
6847,"Why did I not review this earlier!
I haven't had the game on Steam of too long, but I played WAY TOO long on my friend's XBox 360 years ago.
I've had a blast with this game, and I intend to keep playing it in the future!
It DOES have bugs, but you can ignore it. The experience is worth suffering through any bugs that may occur. I consider it part of the experience.
I even prefer this over Borderlands 2, particularly about the loot system (though it probably is less consistent).

I did recieve this for free, as a gift from my brother for Christmas, so that we could play toghter. Good times."
6848,I love this game. Losts of Fun. Everybody NEED to play it.
6849,There is not much to say except that it is one of the best games ever made. I just hope they keep it up all the way to Borderlands 3
6850,"If you recently played Fallout, you might want to wait a few months before giving this one a go. At least that's what happened to me the first time. Now I find it really addictive."
6851,"I mean i recommend this game if you play with 3 friends , but solo? O hell nooooo
Tons of fun assured. 
Auto-pick needed thou but nvm.
"
6852,I played Borderlands 2 first before i played this one.  It felt like i was going back in time anyways its a great game buy it while it is on sale!
6853,This game is To much fun. Buy it and have a  great time playing it. You will not stop.
6854,Best game ever made!
6855,"Great ""graphic novel"" visual style.
Don't expect a rich narrative.  
But get ready to blast a whole lot of dudes in hockey masks

Shoot shoot shoot 
Loot loot loot
Repeat!

Addictive, mindless fun."
6856,Missing Linux support with is present in other series. Game is good i recomend it.
6857,I think this is a fun game i recommend this game really because right now it is on sale and worth it
6858,"creepy alien dogs with big fang mouths and no eyes are cool but i wish this game had just normal dogs

9/10"
6859,"The FPS RPG that just keeps on giving! If you like FPS and RPG, and don't want to have to comprimise. This is the game for you. ""Too much loot"" is definitely something you'll keep telling yourself."
6860,"Borderland's biggest problem is that it's a loot game that actually OVERWHELMS you with loot, then gives you a pitifully disorganized mess of an inventory system to deal with it all.

It's easy to fall into the familiar grind of stopping every few minutes to check the gun you just found against the guns you already possess to see if you've happened upon a small incremental upgrade. While this type of gameplay is inherent to many loot games, Borderlands' poor systems slow this whole experience to an insufferable crawl.

It's a shame, because Borderlands is the type of world I could easily get immersed in, were it not for its constant need to scream LOOOOOOOT in your face all the time. There isn't a single corner of the vast open world that isn't stuffed with some variety of loot box, and each one has a bright shiny GREEN LIGHT that sticks out like a sore thumb in the brown and yellow tones of the world. This is intentional, because Borderlands really really wants you to care about loot. It wants you to loot everything, and you will spend more than half of your time in the game opening boxes for weapons, ammo, and cash, really for no other reason besides the fact that it's just so fucking GREEN and IN YOUR FACE ALL THE TIME. You could easily get through the game by looting 20% of what you find, and yet you will have your psyche exploited by the mechanic as you run around everywhere and loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot

If it were a well-designed mechanic, it might be a perversely enjoyable activity, the way it sort of is in better loot games like Diablo. But like I said, the game's biggest sin is its inability to let you manage the loot in an efficient way. It can't be overstated how cumbersome and unhelpful the whole loot system is. You can see a gun's specs hovering in front of you before you pick it up, but it will only represent whether its stats are better or worse than the gun you are currently holding, and only as vague up or down arrows signifying better or worse. The problem with this is that comparing a rocket launcher you've found to the pistol you're holding is strategically useless. Even if you ARE holding a launcher, HOW MUCH better or worse the stats are isn't visible, since your equipped gun's stats are hidden. What this works out to in practice is picking up every gun you see and going through your entire backpack every 5-10 minutes to slowly figure out what's worth keeping. Alternatively, you can ignore many loot drops, but since the game's common-uncommon-legendary-exotic-whatever classifications are pretty arbitrary, a relatively common green drop might outperform your rare yellow drop, so it's advantageous to always, always check. This becomes very, very dull.

This might seem like a minor inconvenience, but it affects you constantly. Even the inventory menus themselves make no sense at all, and figuring out how to compare and even equip weapons is dumbfoundingly illogical to new players.

It seems like it would have been so easy to design a system wherein the SMG you just found is instantly compared to the best SMGs in your backpack, all displayed visually next to one another in the game world. It's as if the devs knew that most of the loot you find is garbage and weren't really expecting you to think too hard about it, which undermines the entire point of the game.

The bottom line is that Borderlands makes the whole process of finding better guns and becoming stronger a tedious pain in the ass. It's just not fun. And it's a shame because the variety of Borderlands' weapons are what makes it so special compared to other shooters.

Mechanically, as a shooter, Borderlands is just okay. I found precision weapons to be a chore to use, since your screen ""flinches"" too often to get steady beads when you get shot at, and the RPG nature of accuracy means your shots will often miss even when the reticle is lined up correctly. There are too many charging-type enemies (read: zero AI) that require you to jump backwards while shooting as the only effective strategy. Each class' special skill feels very underpowered and aren't that fun to use. And on a whole, animation is stiff and jerky which makes predicting enemy movement pretty hard. The guns do look, feel, and sound good though, which helps a lot.

Challenge-wise, it's a purely mathematical level-based RPG, where missions over your level are hard as nails, and missions underneath you are cake walks. There is so much XP to earn though, especially with the DLC included, that it's very easy to only focus on missions that are at or below your level, which makes the entirety of the game very easy. I was vastly overlevelled for the last third of the game, which wound up being a good thing since I was so bored of it by that point.

The story is barebones, interesting NPCs are sparse with practically no recorded dialogue, the enemy variety is lacking, the missions are mostly stale fetch quests, the vehicles are garbage, and there is a lot of backtracking required through areas you just cleared to go turn in said quests.

It's actually a pretty miserable experience the more I think about it.

Fortunately, a boring, lonely game like Borderlands is much less boring and lonely with friends. Kind of the way I imagine working an assembly line would also be less boring and lonely with friends.

UNfortunately, I wound up completing the campaign solo since I couldn't find anybody to play with. (I can safely say that my Borderlands 2 co-op experience was superior.)

Borderlands doesn't hide its multiplayer focus, with certain cutscenes referring to you as a group even when you're playing alone, and class-specific items dropping that you can't use, and better loot only accessible when you're with other people.

I invested 48 hours into this product, completing the entire campaign and every quest, save for a handful of RNG-based achievements in the DLC. And through most of those 48 hours, I was bored senseless. It's hard to explain how someone can choose to not recommend a game they put that much of their life into....but just because I wasted my time doesn't mean I suggest that YOU waste YOUR time.

Why didn't I stop? The answer is that while Borderlands is mostly a pretty below average game, it taps into gaming compulsions very successfully. It includes literally hundreds of quests to check off, one of which is ALWAYS displayed on your screen. No single quest takes particularly long, and there are always multiple quests to do in your area, so bouncing around from one to the next ""just to get them out of the way"" is an easy loop to get trapped in.

Borderlands also features the operant RNG schedules inherent to the genre (read up on behavioral psychology in gaming), which means that every loot crate opened is a wild card chance at something good. I don't think it's designed maliciously, and one could argue that it's a generous game with its loot, but it's the type of system that will hook gamers no matter how bored they feel with the actual core gameplay.

In conclusion, as this has been an intensely negative and long review, there are a few good things I want to mention.


:D GOOD THINGS! :D

Some of the voice acting feels really natural.

The writing can be clever sometimes.

It's relentlessly depraved.

The arid atmosphere can be immersive.

The art style is gorgeous and highly detailed, especially manmade constructions and signage.

The whole game has lots of personality, from NPCs and bosses to cutscene direction and dialogue.

You can shoot crazy midgets sometimes."
6861,"It was awesome, now it is just EPIC."
6862,"My Abolute Favourite Game of All Time, And game series. If You Like Games With Crazy Amounts Of Weapon Variants And No Two Guns The Same Then This Is 100% The Game For You! Also The Different Characters Can Cover Everyone's Playstyles, And Also The Humour In This Game Is Great With It's Good Quest Names. Now The Art Style... I Love It But It Is VERY Love or Hate to Alot of People. So Overall The Best Game Series I Have EVER Played, And If you like what I have said you should totally try it out!"
6863,"OG as hell, doesn't get much better than this when it comes to a blast from the bast, I remember playing this game as a kid and doing alright but not finding anything good, the shit done changed
love this game would play again 9/10

"
6864,This is a great game and extremely fun when you play it with a friend
6865,"I actually like this game better than the second one.
Such a great game!
But the ending is somewhat lackluster."
6866,"1.One of my top 3 favorite RPGs of all time

2.Over 50 hours and still not bored

3.SOOOO MANY GUNS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
6867,"Great game, Multiplayer is dead in 2016 but you can still have fun with friends, or people from the community."
6868,"It's a golden oldie.

One thing that was absolutely annoying as hell was the DLC with the arena. 12H to finish!! Are you freakin kidding me!

The lack of weapons that scale with level was also not the best gaming experience.

But hey you have got to love the humour in the game! Makes it interesting"
6869,Really can't stand the FoV. It's causing me headache.
6870,"I have to say I have looked everywhere for a FPS..RPG...EPIC Game and guess what I found it! Borderlands takes the cake and deserves all the hype and all the left overs!! Get this game and get stuck in hours of massive gun battles, some smooth questing and leveling up for you to sink your teeth into! I'm keen on the graphics and going the route of different rather then normal in gameing these days. A fresh breath of air when it comes to Borderlands and the extent put into making this game one of the best out there to date. I got the game on sale for $4.99 which made me finally buy the game but for full price it is still worth it!

Game Rating: ***** 5.0 out of 5.0"
6871,Loved it.
6872,Played through this game with my boyfriend. It was a real bonding experience. 10/10
6873,"Look a new gun! Nice FPS with unique graphics, great story and even better characters. Hilariously fun, especially with friends in co-op."
6874,"Borderlands would have to be one of my favourite games. Its a good fun shooter and as annoying as Claptrap can be, he is freaking hilarious and I wouldnt change him"
6875,PRETTY FUN GAME.
6876,"I played this game on PS3 way back when and definitely enjoyed it but now that I've come back to it, I've realized that this game is absoultely incredible. The Graphics hold up because they're cell shaded and the gunplay and class abilities are really fun but what makes this game so great is the LOOT! I'm talkin guns, class mods, grenade mods, shields, backpack upgrades and class artifacts. There's so much customization with each character and you'll really start to come into your own by the second playthrough. One playthrough isn't enough. You gotta play through this game at least twice with each class and then all the DLCs to really get everything out of this game. It's, in my opinion, the perfect mixture of an RPG and FPS. There's many stats and hidden abilities on so many guns and it just makes you itch to push on and find a god tier weapon with mindblowing stats. They've tapped deeply into the addiction and reward centers of my brain with this game. If you haven't played it yet, I would say you should most definitely try it out. Very few games are this old and still so damned good."
6877,"Likeable characters,
Lots of loot,
Lots of missions.

5/5 - MASTERPIECE!"
6878,"Shoot
E
Shoot

Get Exp
Go out and say it's your favorite franchise"
6879,"Very cool game. I'm about 1/4 to 1/2 way through Borderlands 1. So far the game is great; a bit cartoony but it is still fun. I just beat ""Sledge"". He is the first real big boss that is a pain to kill. It took me about five tries to finally kill him. When you get to the room where Sledge is, he has several cronies that are fighting for him. Once you lower his shield he can die pretty fast if you have a good weapon. On the final try of killing him I had him chase me to the front door into his den. He won't come out into the hall way so he stands in the door. I just walked far enough away where his weapon won't do much damage and I used a machine gun to just mow him down. This took me about 200 rounds but it killed him and did little damage to me."
6880,"TIME TO POUND...SOME MEAT PUPPETS
And with that quote out of the way, onto the actual review of sorts.

At first, I didn't like the game. But I'm a stupid, biased son of a skag that started with BL2. I thought BL was too empty, too dead, too devoid of any charm or...anything really. But, just like WATCH_DOGS, the more I played it, the more I came to absolutely love this game.

It's Pandora, nobody cares about this place.
It's got it own crude humor that I love.
And the loot is so much more damn generous. I never thought I'd see two legendaries in the same vendor.

HEY, if you're reading this, you've reached the end. Now stop reading and buy the game already! You steam library will thank you for it!"
6881,besides old still a great game with unique artwork and a nice play style with mixed RPG and FPS
6882,its aight
6883,Cool game :p
6884,"Pros:

+ Comedy is good, if not great. 

+ Memorable and likable characters.

+ Shooting mechanics are forgiving and fun.

+ Loot-based mechanics...

+ A LOT of content.

Cons:

- Driving is fidgety. You get used to it, but it could be vastly improved upon.

- Looting is rarely rewarding. You're only comparing stats, and once you get a great weapon, you'll stick with it for a long time.

- Story is virtually non-existent

- Environments grow stale. A lot of similar looking places.

Overall: B

Not perfect, but I'll be damned if it isn't a great time sink. DLC is all pretty great (so far) and multiplayer is a blast."
6885,"Since Borderlands 2 is one of the my favoritestestest games ever, I thought it would be a given that I should try Borderlands 1. Well unfortunately Borderlands 1 is simply devoid of the charm and humor of Borderlands 2. The main reason is that there is nearly no voice acting. Having to read everything for a quest totally removes any shread of character personality, and though text can still be funny, very few quests were actually humorous and I don't think I laughed even once in my whole playthrough. On top of that, I had constant FOV issues that made playing dizzying and stressful. As much as I had hoped, I just can't recommend it."
6886,"Bought the game of the year version for £4.99 and I absolutely love it. I can't believe it took me this long to play it. If you're hesitant about buying it, just do it, you'll thank yourself. Each time I sit down to play it 3 hours will pass before I realiseand force myself to stop.

Also fuck skags"
6887,"Great game 10/10 loads of content, love cel shading."
6888,"Borderlands is one of the best game series ever made!
i was very sceptical when it first came out and didn't play it because of the graphics style.
i had a friend insist on me borrowing it shortly after the release (on ps3).
since then i have never looked back i have brought this game on ps3, xbox360 and now on pc.

Its addictivly fun, the graphics style fits the humor perfectly, the multiplayer is perfect and even claptrap while annoying most of the time has his own charm.

10/10 buy this game and the sequal and the game that comes between this one and the sequal but was released after the sequal!
"
6889,this is too much fun
6890,"What can I say about Borderlands? well basically it's a shoot and loot FPS type of game with randomly generated weapons and RPG Elements. The plot? to cut it short you're a Vault Hunter in search of something known as the Vault which is supposed to be full of riches beyond your wildest dreams but instead it turns out to be something else (no spoilers) and during your travels on Pandora which is the name of the Planet where the game is set you find yourself being guided by the Mysterious Angel who later on find what her true reasons for opening the Vault are (again no spoilers)

This game is simply fantastic, very action packed and full of many exhilarating Firefights however my only complaint with this game is that everything is spread so far apart as in you're going to find yourself running from Point A to point B an awful lot which can slow the game down somewhat. There is a Fast Travel system but again even those are spread out too much and also you have the Catch A Ride as well which enables you to drive vehicles but the controls are pretty wonky with them.

All in all if you like FPS and RPGs Borderlands is the game for you 9/10"
6891,I liked the game but its a lot harder than borderlands 2
6892,"While it hasn't aged as good as Borderlands 2 it still is a very enjoyable game. I had to change my mouse polling rate to 250hz instead of 1000hz because the game stuttered like shit. Also set PhysX to low, it's just there to distract you from actual important stuff."
6893,yes
6894,Good stuff
6895,k
6896,"If Diablo II were a first person shooter set in a sci-fi universe and starred the background characters from Road Warrior you'd get a good idea of what this game is like. If you like shooting things. skill trees and opening crates full of ammo and loot this is the game for you. There's a bajillion kinds of weapons plus the story is funny. 

About the only downsides are the game feels a bit too open at times. It features lots of wide open areas which means a ton of running plus it can be a bit grindy. The grind is fun 95% of the time, though. Borderlands 2 is a big improvement as far as graphics, level variety and just about everything else but this game has its own charm. While you don't need to play through it to enjoy the second I recommend it since the series as a whole is a lot of fun. I'd rate Borderlands a 10/10."
6897,Im still trying to run this game on good fps and I don´t really think its sequels have a better story.
6898,"Wait a second
this isn't Bad Rats Show

EDIT: This game is better than Bad Rats Show afterall

ihaventfinishedityet/10"
6899,"Found a gun named 01001010111001001011111001, i love it."
6900,"The game that that started Role-Playing Shooter genre...
The game that brings fun while killing enemies...
The game that have milions of milions of weapons becuase of randomization...
The game that is worth playthrough 2
The game that is best played with friends but you can play it solo with no problems...
The game that have dlc's that really give you more fun

Absolutely recommend"
6901,"I'm a Borderlands fan, i remember when i first played this one i thougth it was the effing ti..s. Believe me you should play this one first before 2 or TPS or you won't enjoy it as much as i did the first time. I have to be honest sometimes it feels like is a grindfest to get levels and gear but i love it anyway. 

Shitty plot but awesome gameplay... for it's time."
6902,Every game in this series is a satirical piece of genuis.
6903,Hours Of endless fun!!!
6904,"Well. If you want a challangeing Co-Op fun with your friends, then this game is for you. I recommend this game."
6905,gg game
6906,Borderlands Is a first person shooter with some comedy and a cel shaded world. The first one is the most serious game. My personal favorite.
6907,"Borderlands is a humorous, top-notch, first-person shooter. With a gorgeous art style, very well written text and a permanent feeling that the game does not takes itself too seriously, your first adventure in Pandora is bound to be a blast!

Although the game is ""old"" by today's standards, it's visuals have aged nicely, mostly because of the art style. The gameplay is tight, controls are responsive, and the world itself is very interesting, albeit it is a bit too shallow for all it's ""openess"". The ending seens a little rushed, but other than that, this game is a good purchase.

I recommend Borderlands and all it's DLC, with the notable exception of the Moxxi's Underdome, which is a terrible chore (seriously, avoid it)."
6908,"one of the wost games i have ever player over hyped and get boring after 5 munites. Go to point A kill a bunck of minnions the the boss shows up with more minnions, finish that and repete thats the entire game."
6909,I fucking love this game!
6910,not on a mac platform
6911,This game is perfect...i cant stop playing it.
6912,"SUPER GOOD GAME
Gameplay is superb and a well rounded game for those RPG craze fans like me!"
6913,"Finishes playing the game, but sadly I played when my steam went offline. Great game though."
6914,"fantastic game

6916,"[h1]Best game of the franchise, deffinately worth a buy.[/h1]

The graphics are simmilar in all titles, cartoonish with lots of energy.
Gameplay is very smooth, and there are LITTERALLY INFINITE WEAPONS with unique playstyles.
Story can be lacking but is solid regardless."
6917,"10/10 game!
Payed 12 dollars for this"
6918,Recommended !
6919,"Je to první díl, z dle mně jedné z nejlepších sérií v herní hystori! Vyjíma se především komiksovou grafikou, vtipným příběhem a záporáky. První díl je super a velmi doporučuji i druhý díl a všechna DLC."
6920,Now i know where did cs go took recoil from
6921,One of the best fps games I've ever played.
6922,it is very fun and much better on pc than on console
6923,"It's a fun romp with friends, but it's a bland game at its core. I heavly suggest its sequal, but I'd stay away from the original unless you've played the second game and DLCs and just really need more. The original gets old fast, and it has not aged well for a game from 2009."
6924,"Hey, That's pretty good."
6925,"it totaly sucks i cant stand it its a waist of money i got the intire seriese before i played it i dont like it but some people might
"
6926,"Awesome, just buy it."
6927,games good best looter shooter out there
6928,"I have to say I honestly love this game. I'm usually one of the people who bash First-Person Shooters (Like COD) but this is something totally different. The cell-shading style of the came gives it a light-hearted almost cartoon-y feel while you love the bloodthristy gunfights. All the unique weapon possibilites and the character skills and perks make this leaps and bounds ahead of any FPS compared to it. It really is a FPS-RPG style game. Replaying it to get overpowered or even better loot doesn't lose it's charm, trust me, you'll be coming back to Pandora again and again in this game or the other two."
6929,"Such a masterpiece that spawned the holy borderlands series. The debut and the very legacy of Borderlands, I see no game that can ever defeat this one."
6930,"I started my Borderlands addiction with Borderlands 2, so this game was a bit of a letdown for me. Don't get me wrong, this game is still great fun, and even better with friends. I'm not even a fan of first person shooters, and I still had a blast playing this. It's just not as fun as 2. That's all. 

There's a much, much longer review of this game on my blog: [url=http://heartlessgamer.blogspot.com/2016/05/game-review-borderlands.html]The Heartless Gamer Girl[/url]"
6931,is good
6932,"Played Borderlands before i got it on steam, the gameplay might look common but this game is unique in its own way.
  
theres only four words to describe this game

"" Four Words Isn't Enough """
6933,I love the borderlands franchise and i really appreciated the chance to buy all three games along with the borderlands DLC's all for less than $20!
6934,"Very addictive game, it's more that i spected :3"
6935,"I don't care what kind or type of enemy you are, my car will turn you to mush C:"
6936,The Borderlands series is perhaps one of the most consistently fun franchises.
6937,"after playing borderland 2 on the 360 before coming to pc a lot of people recommended the original to me now,  don't get me wrong i think this is a good game i've played it for 3 days in a row however the game can get a bit repetitive and the final boss is a bit of a let down in my opinion but if your paying this franchise for the first time i would get 2 the DLC is a lot better and the game in my opinion  is a lot more satisfying but by no way skip this game its a lot of fun too :)"
6938,gg

6940,Pretty good game.
6941,"I LOVE THIS GAME
- Crude Funny Jokes
- Great Gameplay
- High Replay Value
"
6942,"Gives a whole new definition for the term ""Money Spiders"". They should be calling them ""Spiders that drop HUGE guns"".

10/10 will kill every lifeform to get mad guns again."
6943,good
6944,OMG MY FAVOURITE GAME
6945,Good times!
6946,"it's a good calssic i highly recommend it to others the only thing i got to complain about about it is the shooting system is not too good some weapons will shoot sideways for some reason 


all around it's a fun game. also try to play it with friends"
6947,Honestly great game! I am hooked!
6948,"Great game.

If you're hooked and looking for more of the Borderlands experience I recommend this over Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel."
6949,Like it!
6950,"The Borderlands series is pretty much the same thing across the board on matters of gameplay, and it is really simple at that, i don't see why anyone would buy more than one of these games, i did and mildly regret it, only buy this game if you care about the story, with i can't see why anyone would."
6951,Lit
6952,"Borderlands is an action-RPG / first person shooter. It features cooperative-play, phat loot(tm), and vehicles. This is a game designed to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. In this regard, it's a success.

But what do I think of it? Well... eh. I mean, I like Borderlands well enough... I guess. When it comes to this game, the best statements I can muster come off as half-hearted and wishy-washy. I've always been a fan of loot-driven games, but there has to be some sort of hook beyond the basic qualities. It doesn't have to be something particularly clever, but it has to make the game stand out. I think Borderlands lacks this quality, but it's still an alright way to spend a weekend of four. 

Oh wait. You're probably expecting an explanation of what this ""quality"" is supposed to be aren't you? When it comes to videogames, originality can only go so far. Oft-times, we just have to accept the fact that not every game we play is going to be completely unique and excellent. Sometimes we end up buying games because they look interesting, are in a genre we enjoy, or our friends are playing them. Borderlands is a perfect example.

To me, the words perfect and mediocre, are two sides of the same coin. Today's perfection is tomorrow's mediocrity. What was once the gold-standard, has now become the base-line. Borderlands has everything it needs to accomplish its goal of being a competent FPS Lootemup, and nothing more. The shooting mechanics aren't anything brilliant, the controls are acceptable, and the story/writing serve their purpose. The skill-tree system is neat, but only in a ""that makes sense"" sort of way. The build you create isn't really important, because the same two or three abilities tend to dominate every encounter.

The guns, the aspect that should set this game apart from the pack, are merely okay. One commonality among loot-based games (especially more recent ones), is that very few character-builds actually use their weapon. By that I mean the sword, polearm, or otherwise is merely a stat-boosting piece of equipment. Usually, the player just uses their skills in order to kill enemies, instead of swinging a large piece of metal around. Practically the sole method of killing in Borderlands is through the usage of guns. Unfortunately, 98% of them are useless. This is especially true of the ""gimmick"" guns dropped by bosses. More often than not, you're going with the standard weapons, just because they're actually effective. In other words, instead of swinging the boring swords, you have to fire the boring guns. The inability to create an identity through play-style is the #1 reason why this game fails to stand out. 

A game like Borderlands could have really benefitted from more intricate level-designs, as well as a greater level of depth in terms of controls. I'm thinking that the developers could have come up with all sorts of crazy manuevers to pull off. Sliding, air-dashes, back-flips, shoulder-charges, some parkour stunts, you get the idea. Not all of these moves would have to be in the game, but even a couple of them would have lended more dynamism to the combat. This would also make the maps more fun to explore, well... if there was more to them besides wide-open spaces to catch a ride(tm) through, or the bog-standard ""rooms filled of cover"" that's in every other FPS. 

The RPG elements, while appreciated, sometimes make the game feel too much like an MMO. I know it's just a guideline, but when everything has a level suggestion next to it, the atmosphere is lost. While I always enjoy the immediate pleasures of leveling up and finding better gear, the world-building gets pushed away. Didn't TellTale make a Borderlands game that addresses this very concern? Hm... Perhaps I should look into it.

When a game makes an attempt to stand out, it can instead become flawed. The developer tried something different, and either it was a bad idea to begin with, or they didn't quite get it right. Borderlands doesn't take these risks. It's a perfectly mediocre product that delivers enough incentivization to keep gamers playing, it doesn't strive to do any more than that. I don't think that makes this game worthy of praise, but I still enjoyed it well enough... I guess."
6953,i liek it
6954,"By far my favourite Title of the Series. The Artstyle is great, the Loot System just works, the Gameplay is awesome though the Story might not be as good as in Borderlands 2. Nevertheless, the end-game feels much better than in Borderlands 2 since all of the weapon types are viable and it has a lot of Replayability. The classes are all fun to play with and the Skill System has a bunch of active skills rather than passives like Borderlands 2. You can actually make some powerful builds by going down a specific tree. Driving isn't that great but CE works wonders on this game.

Get it. It has been out for 7 years now and if you haven't played it yet you should definitly pick it up. One of my favourite games of all time!"
6955,"Fun experience, it definetly has a fresh take on RPG elements with gun progression and action.

Of course its 10x more fun playing coop with friends, which... yeah actual friends will be needed since barely anyone plays this game online anymore... But still, its really fun even in single player."

Update: Still better."
6958,"Decent shooting, great loot, simplified but somewhat satisfying RPG system.

Wacky universe that I found very engrossing at first, but towards the end of the game monotony and repetition sets in, and the ending is a huge disappointment.

Multiplayer works fine but personally I found it detracted from leisurely sorting through my loot and enjoying the sights. Some classes also seem to get more kills easily and progress faster which is a problem in coop - might've been a difference in skill between players in our team, so I'm not sure."
6959,Perfect game
6960,"-New to Borderlands? If you are a completionist, read (a). If you are not, read (b).  

(a)-I recommend this game for completionists who are looking to get into a new series because this game sets the groundwork for BL2. The story introduces you to the world of Pandora and the major themes, but there isnt really any character development. BL2 gives you the character backstory that this game lacks and builds on the world events/themes. BL2 also takes things WAAAY further with more useful character abilities and a far more entertaining story.

(b)-Skip this and go straight to Borderlands 2 (you wont miss much, but if youre curious, just read the story on wikipedia) This was a great game for its time, but people interested in Borderlands or that are looking for a good co-op game would get more out of BL2 and be okay missing out on this one. BL2 does everything this game does, except way better.

PROTIP: Roland has the best character abilities by a landslide
"
6961,"If Diablo 2 and Serious Sam had a baby, this is what you get.

Borderlands is a great game, and there is a lot of fun to be had. I played the entire game and all its DLC with three friends, and that's how I'd recommend you play it as well (even with just one friend). The game's main story is not too deep (which it makes up for in over-the-top humour), and the sidequests can definitely get repetitive. However, as long as you've got a friend to experience the chaos with, it's tons of fun.

8/10, and the only reason it's not more is because it will problably be a little bit dull by yourself."
6962,"It has ages a bit but it's some gameplay, some animations, and how missions are set up. But its still a good buy if you have already played the later BL games."
6963,"It is now a bit too old, but it is worth it. Loads of stuff to do. The DLC's are great, except the Moxxi one."
6964,i liek eggs
6965,A fantastic game. Non stop action and just pure fun!
6966,"Well... kinda got bored too quick but... the game is good, gotta admit..."
6967,"Screw you.

What the hell is wrong with these HORRIBLE graphics? The sloppy controls? The neverending f*** tutorials?
This f**** stupid field of vision.
The jokes that seem tailored to please an 8 year old kid? Tries hard, but fails.

Screw that game. Tried several classes, but it simply sucks. 
B2 is not even better. There are so many good games out there, but not this one.


If you like this game, please do humanity a favor and consider castration. 
Or just grow up: a ""new"" licence is not an excuse for shitting crap."
6968,"Borderlands,
what a great 2 part series, and this is where it begins.

The first borderlands is in my opinion more difficult than Borderlands 2.
Especially when it comes to achievements, which can be real hour-long grindfests.

Graphic wise it looks good, may find it dated, but it does the job and gets you into the mood of a wasteland feel.

Gameplay is pretty good, you can play each character in different ways, but one downside may be that you have to play the game again and again and again so the story may lose a bit of it's feeling, it gets worse in Borderlands 2, but I guess this is just a minor complaint.

Story is good, DLC are rock solid best one is in my oppinion General Knoxx, because of what it adds and how much loot you become in comparison.

A fun shooter, which is fun alone and with friends, Min-Maxing aside you'll have fun using the Legendary weapons with cool effects.  
"
6969,fun
6970,"Great fun, even after a third playthrough it can still be entertaining.

If only they'd stopped after this one. It was fantastic fun and they ruined its good name by making more of them."
6971,good grinding game
6972,We need the Mac version on steam.
6973,"Instant classic, gotta catch 'em all"
6974,This game is awesome. Gameplay. Story line. character design. Had this game for over a year and decided to play because i had nothing to do one day. My expectations were set low because this game is almost 8 years old. Man this game rocks. 10/10
6975,Better when you have people to play with 😘
6976,"Very well written story, very fun game, and some of the best humor I've ever seen in a game. Super long too if you want to get everything done 100%, so if you want a project, here it is."
6977,"A classic and genre refurbishing shooter\rpg, set the bar for a unique style of graphics and humour in the first person shooter category, quality title even now in 2016 only bettered by Borderlands 2."
6978,Good but not as good as the others
6979,ITS LIKE DESTINY BUT WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY BETTER :)
6980,"Borderlands combine the best in first-person action with player skills customization and vehicle combat for countless of hours of uncovering the secrets of the Vault. Your journey begins in a vast lands of hostile, bandit-ridden planet of Pandora. The combined incentives of killing enemies, gathering precious loot, cashing in, and leveling up are the main driving forces in Borderlands. The title has a dusty, run-down feel to it as you travel through world of Pandora as one of four characters, each with a unique attitude and skillset. The graphic design resonates well with Borderlands' irreverent sense of humor, abounding in adventurous quests filled with bunch of enemies and glorious loot. Borderlands also allows for multiple players to share the same game experience simultaneously in online co-op gameplay. Mayhem awaits. Bring friends."
6981,"The game doesn't function on PC as well as the second one does, but it is still a thoroughly enjoyable game. There are tools out there to fix things like the limited FOV."
6982,"Amazing game!
Wonderful story line, linier but still got free roaming elements to it.
Great loot system and rarities.
9/10!
I would recommend this game, cheap and wonderful game play"
6983,This Game is very fun. I played through the whole story in 60 hours and there are a lot more of sidequests and DLCs. Nice gameplay + Awesome Story + Cheap = Overall a good investment.
6984,great game... it would be if it was possible to play in split screen without having to modify the config and download Dxwnd and such
6985,"Minecraft

6986,*Chuckle*
6987,"Borderlands is an ARPG/FPS hybrid released almost 8 years ago, yet it still holds up well today. What else can I say? It has insane replay value, an armory of weapons so huge it could rival that of the US military, and 4-player drop-in/drop-out co-op that isn't annoying to use. It's a classic game that deserves to be in any FPS enthusiasts' library."
6988,"Borderlands is a great piece of a game.
It's an FPS with mostly RPG elements.
Best to play with friends.
Has a Great Story. Play it before Borderlands 2!

Cons:
Grinding achivs to 100%"
6989,"I beat the second and came back to the first, and can definately say that the 2nd is the best out of all of them. Get it if you like the series but if your new to it I'd say start off with the 2nd since its alot more fun and has a better feel to it. This one seems to take a more serious approach and in doing so is less fun for me but still enjoyable. 7/10"
6990,"Bought it as part of the super sale, with all the DLCs and stuff. I am a casual player, but I still really liked this game. As an RPG lover, I do got to say that the story of this one is a bit BS. Nevertheless, to relax and kill some people in your spare time, this will do. I would say, buy if it is on sale, and if your mates play it. Team party here could be really fun."
6991,"I cannot explain how this game works.It is random madness.
But it's good random madness."
6992,"I didn't play it here on steam. I played it on my old xbox 360 and got to lvl 28-29 with Mordecai. I bought it here on one of the lastest steam sales hoping that someday I'll have time to play it again. I couldn't let this game on my library without writing an analysis, though.

10/10

Next question."
6993,My score fot the game is :  7/10
6994,"Borderlands 1 is a good game, but in comparison to its sequels it's very bland:

- Most characters (NPCs and playable characters alike) have no soul or are dead inside, it's like they don't want to try.
- The playable areas are all too similar to each other, mostly empty and full of rocks and sand. While this is what Pandora is supposed to be, it's clear that in the sequels not every area looks the same.
- Guns look and sound like toys.
- Simple objectives are often a whole quest.
-FOV is low (fixed in the GOTY Enhanced version)

It's not a perfect game, but it's still very enjoyable, has that classic feel to it."
6995,I liked it. I just wish the classes weren't genderlocked.
6996,"It was pretty good. I played the entire series and the first one was prob the best, but that is probably because I was a child."
6997,"oh thats nice, oh thats real good"
6998,"Eh, maybe it's not like the other Borderlands games, but it's still alright."
6999,"Loved this game when it was new but can't seem to play it anymore. Any movement makes me want to vomit. Sorry, Borderlands, you were great before you ever gave me vertigo."
7000,"I would recommend this game for everyone! I have played it with 3 of my friends and it made the gameplay even more fun. Although what I will never understand is why all the bosses in every game that I played drop THE BEST equipment right when you finish the game. 

PROS:
-Different but awesome graphics (takes time to get used to)
-4 totally different classes with only 1 skill and with 3 different trees to accompany it
-A lot of different weapons to choose from
-A tank-and-spank ride with 4 seats (for 4 player-game)
-Not too easy nor too hard
-Funny and enjoyable storyline

CONS:
-2 different playthroughts (I honestly don't understand why people say ""If you havent played 2nd playthought you really havent played the game"" I wouldnt agree. You just go same thing all over again only with mobs at higher level. I don't see the point.
-Boring DLC's"
7001,"Definitely worth buying and having/playing. If you have a friend or more of them (highly unlikely), this is a game for a good coop play."
7002,"Pros:
Art work
Blowing things up
Setting things on fire
The story line
Single player

Cons:
Multiplay seems to have a few issues, connection drops, lag, etc.

Not a game I'd play with others because of the unreliability of the multiplayer for my experience. The single player alone makes it work it though.
5/5
I have come back to this game a few times just for a play through for both xbox and pc."
7003,THIS GAME IS LIT
7004,I shot thing and they exploded into a rainbow of items. I used those items to shoot more things and eventually the game ended.
7005,I cant control it to save my life why is everything so fast even when I turn sensitivity to the lowest it can physically go? The resolution sucks ass default. I mean the game itself is great you know its just that the port is disgusting.
7006,amazing game the first of many
7007,"It has got a few flaws yes, but this game holds up very well due to it's unique loot system(for a first person shooter) ridiculously fun co-op and most of all the unique art and visuals, which have and will continue aging very well."
7008,"It's not Borderlands 2. But it's a crap load of fun.

And while not really required for the Borderlands story, it helps bring it all together.

Also, don't ignore the DLC!"
7009,"Considering that the graphics are sort of comic book style, it is still visually appealing and there is plenty of blood and gore to go around. Single player mode is still fun but this game was meant to be played with friends in co-op mode. Up to 4 players can play in co-op mode but I've recently been playing with just one other person and the game is still a blast. There are literally thousands of different weapons and many of them have some ingenious attributes that add to the overall fun of the game."
7010,Exploit everything that you can possibly exploit because you are severly underleveled in a boss fight.
7011,Roland is my bro!!
7012,A fun game to play with friends. Boss battles are pretty lackluster but searching for loot is always fun.
7013,"Borderlands. The game that changed how we see first person shooters. I picked this up on console and put close to 200 hours on it. I got it for PC and did the same and then got it on Steam just because. This is a great game that was worth more than the original asking price and has only grown in value as it has aged. 

The main campaign is a bit dry at points, but I feel the shoot and loot carries it through these points. It wasn't till near the end of the game that the humor of the game started to really develop. Then comes the DLC which is where the game found itself and became truly awesome. 

While it is fun on it's own, it gets better with a friend and crazy with 4. Even looking at the graphics and the game play today, it still holds up."
7014,"This game is perfect if you like playing around with your friends and fight hard bosses and enemies, a game full of loot and other stuff. It's easy to run, Mine is on the highest graphics and my computer is garbage!"
7015,"wonderful game, story never seems to end assuming you dont cheat..."
7016,"Seriously boring.  Crouch, shoot, find health.  Crouch, shoot, find health.  Uninstalled."
7017,"This game is just awesome!.
Love the franchise and the cartoony visuals.
I just love Borderlands and have a deep respect for the work and effort the developers have put in the game.

Great story telling!"
7018,So much fun. 8/10
7019,"This game is a classic. The replay value is high, I've beat it twice and I am just coming back to beat it with another class. Definitely a must have if you enjoy FPS, RPGS...video games in general, actually."
7020,"Well, i purchased this game because i played TALES FROM THE BORDERLANDS and i really loved it and wanted to be in pandora,fighting in pandora,spending sometimes with CL4P-TP xD ,Finding a vault 🌚 and this is great actually.
Now I'm planning to play borderlands 2 after borderlands 1."
7021,Best Game ever.
7022,"physics engine is way off in paticular with the guns, makes if very difficult to actually hit any of your enemies, issues that was not on the console version. Would have enjoyed this on PC but just another console port."
7023,"While it's not as fast paced or wacky as it's sequel (as well as pre-sequel), the original Borderlands still has alot of charm to it and is quite enjoyable. With a quick .ini file tweak you can also change the default FOV, which helped me enjoy the game more. I'd also recommend playing in co-op as this game along with later ones in the series are far more fun, in my opinion, alongside some friends with coordinated builds and roles. In conclusion I happily recommend this game to anyone looking for something to play with friends, especially with how cheap it can get on sale."
7024,"Easily one of the best game franchises i've ever played. (Apart from the pre-sequel, probably still ok but i didn't enjoy any of the characters) The humor in these games is absolutely fantastic, basicly infinite guns, amazing story, missions that don't get repetitive very easily (Some will, mostly side missions) not very grindy, loads of content, great end game (Borderlands 2)"
7025,"Borderlands is a science fiction first-person shooter game with RPG elements created by Gearbox Software for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Mac OS X. The game was revealed in the September 2007 issue of Game Informer magazine and is the first of a planned series. It was released on October 20, 2009. Borderlands features four-player 'drop-in, drop-out' cooperative online play in addition to a single-player mode, and two-player split screen co-op modes for consoles. Much of the gameplay consists of traditional first person shooter elements, combining a selection of weapons to use and a selection of enemies to battle. Players also have access to color customizable vehicles for vehicular combat. Deceased enemies drop random equipment, which is available to pick up. Like traditional RPGs, much of the players' time will be taken up by missions. There are 127 missions of varying length and complexity, 47 of these being part of the story and the other 80 as side missions. Many of these missions can be completed together. Gearbox wants to encourage players to push themselves just a bit further to complete the next mission on their list. Each mission carries its own rewards, such as new weapons and items, or perhaps revealing a new piece of the story. The game also features a gun generator similar to Diablo's random item generation system. This new system generates over 17,000,000 weapons. The system randomized the guns by changing nearly everything about them, including barrel length, round type, round size, ironsights/scope, color, building material, and even elemental damage forms added onto the attack. At any time or place, a player can melee another player to issue a challenge. When the melee is returned, a 1 vs. 1 duel starts. Players can also travel to ""arenas"" located at  various locations in the game world. These arenas are specifically made for competitive play, where players can face off in both free-for-all games or team-based games
(winning duels does not win items but is solely for the purpose of fun). After completing the game, players are free to roam the world and wrap up any side missions left unfinished, drop the Vault key off at Tannis and collect their reward and wander around aimlessly. After returning to the title screen and choosing characters however, players can choose to begin Playthrough 2. On the second playthrough, characters have all of the gear, skills, levels, and money that they ended the game with. All of the enemies scale up, with bandits beginning at level 34, and ascending from there. The names of enemies also adjust to reflect the difficulty setting, i.e. from psycho-maniac-lunatic, midget-little-stunted and Bruiser-Brute-Bully. At the end of Playthrough 2, all of the enemies scale again, ranging from 48-52 and dropping even better loot than before. Players can revisit and battle most of the bosses, and fight for better gear, participate in cooperative play, and fight in the arenas. Colloquially referred to as Playthrough 2.5, marking the completion of Playthrough 2's storyline missions, all enemies and missions scale to either two levels below or above the character and adapts as characters level up (this carries over to the DLCs, and will significantly increase their difficulty when Playthrough 2 of Borderlands is complete). Borderlands includes four character classes, each with unique skills, abilities and back stories. As characters level up, they gain increases to basic stats, such as health totals and accuracy. Each class also has three unique focus skill trees to develop. There are also accessory items specific to each class. The four classes are:

Brick (Berserker) - Berserk
Lilith (Siren) - Phase walk
Mordecai (Hunter) - Bloodwing
Roland (Soldier) - Scorpio turret
In the distant future, in the year 2864, several colonization ships head to Pandora, a planet on the edge of the galaxy. The colonists are drawn there in search of a better life as well as vast mineral resources said to be on the planet, free for the taking, akin to a futuristic gold rush. Some time after settling, the colonists discover that there is little the planet offers aside from some decrepit alien ruins. When the companies mining the planet leave, they let loose the criminals they had employed as forced labor and left any other colonists there. Some of the settlers seek to get rich quick by discovering alien technology. Most others are just trying to survive. After seven Earth years, the planet's slow orbit brings a transition from winter to spring, and many horrifying creatures emerge from hibernation. A beacon of hope for the remaining colonists emerges in the form of a mysterious alien Vault carved in the side of a mountain. This Vault is said to contain vast stores of alien technology and secrets. The only problem is that the people who discovered the Vault were completely wiped out by some sort of protective force. The only evidence of their discovery is a scattered radio transmission, proclaiming the Vault's majesty, but not its location.

7026,"I played through this title more times than I can count. I think the weapons were done right in this itteration of the Borderlands series, and none of the following games really did them justice. The only thing that keeps me from playing it now is the FOV lock that makes it feel like a console game."
7027,ok here we go. Borderlands is  fun to play. but since I  started playing  Borderlands 2 before i played borderlands  the sequel is making more since now that i know the story lines  of each  Characters. i would recomend it  to anyone  who likes shooter games.
7028,"Los controles son medio raros pero igual esta bueno con su sistema de progrecion tipo RPG.
Recomendadisimo para jugar con amigos."
7029,"I think it's a great game.

That being said, if you're new to Borderlands, buy the second one instead. It's way better and get's rid of all the frustrating aspects of the original."
7030,"This game is old school fun. If you like Killing, puzzles, lots of goodies to find and earn. Then get this game. Best part of the game is it's ability to run on low end hardware well.  While recovering from the Win10 bogus battle I ran Borderlands and it's sequels on a 2006 2 core Athlon 3800 withrelative ease , though not at 1920x1080 on my normal game machine. 
 
   My biggest peeve is that the save games are stored in a windows folder that disapears when a system reset occurs (/documents/mygames/****). So I make a habit of backing up the save games from the my games folder in the document library, to a seprate drive where all my games are installed. Beware Keep Nothing on the Windows Install Drive but Windows if you go to win 10. That is if you don't want to chance a reset scrub of all your information. Windows 10 unlike all the Borderlands games ( I play 2 and prequel as well) is unstable and should not have been released to the public in such a terrible state of completion, Win7 in beta was far better than the release version of win10.
 
 I recently made the horrible mistake of going early adapter for Window 10. It was a total nightmare. It crashed and burned to often and the only recourse without a system image stored away is a ""system reset"", which is nearly a clean install with all of your apps and programs erased. the old data files are stored in windows.old if you do it right, though the data is not much good with out the program that created them. 

Good luck and Happy Hunting."
7031,Prime example of why you don't eat cacti while in the desert.
7032,"Awesome game, really enjoyed playing it. Great story with some unexpected surprises; lots of weapons and upgrades to find/purchase; some badass creatures and bosses; hillarious quotes; friendly characters to guide you here and there; side missions to level up when you're not in the mood for fighting bosses; and several moments full of action.
Haven't played a singleplayer game in a while, I'm not that much into them, but this one really got me.

9/10"
7033,Definitely one of the best games I've ever played
7034,I bought this after borderlands 2 and 3. I dont like it.
7035,Amazing game in an Amazing series
7036,Good for its time.
7037,fun yes
7038,This game is where it starts i definetly reccomend playing this first before any of the other games and it definelty sets the backstory for all the other games too! I would definetly reccomend playing with friends because its all the more fun!
7039,"[h1]THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | *2* 3] = ~62% (50%-75%)[/h1]

A pure shoot-and-loot game. Even though this review is mostly for Borderlands 1, it applies to all three, so I copied it to all three. Since the games have been out for quite a while, there are convenient bundles with two or all three of them etc., make sure you check them out before purchasing.

At first, I didn't get ""it"" and thought that the game sucks. I thought it was just a generic shooter (and once again with failed FOV - *sigh*) with gimmicky cartoon shader, very generic loot containers, guns with somewhat randomized values, and the super obvious fetch quest cliché.

But then, a year later, I tried again - and I got ""it"". It's a well done generic shooter (whose FOV can be edited in a file) with an interesting fun-depressing otherworldly feel, cartoon shader, reliably balanced generic loot containers, a surprisingly powerful procedural weapons system, and simple quests that make you deal with all these things in various places and that give you some story background. What makes all this work is the whole that emerges from it. It's like acid music of the 1990s. The Roland TB-303 alone sounds boring, but if you use it right and let it play together with other stuff, it's a very powerful driver, and music history might remember you for [url=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22blue+monday%22+%22hardfloor%22]it[/url].

I ended up buying and playing through BL1, BL2, BL The Pre-Sequel (which came out after 1&2 but whose story plays between 1&2), and almost all DLC. No regrets. It was not a perfect experience, but there's a reason I bought and played [i]all three[/i] games, and the story didn't contribute much to this reason. It's just the mix of all the gameplay ingredients and - excuse me - the mindlessness of it. A simple but sufficiently deep shoot&loot trip that goes on for tens of hours. (According to howlongtobeat.com, roughly: BL1 20-60, BL2 30-80, BLps: 20-40)

The quests become available over time, and you can choose freely which of the ones you soaked up into your quest management screen you tackle at which time. There's an indicator expressing how hard they will be for your current character level.

I thought the procedural weapons approach would probably be stupid, that it would be e.g. just a bit more power or range. But no! There are many changing variables, even the weapon designs (and visual effects) change, fitting the weapon's character. Hunting / comparing for the best weapon and learning about where you'll probably find those and where rather not turns into a passion.



[h1]WHAT'S WRONG?[/h1]

Too bad the inventory interface is not half as good as it should be. Well, at least you can mark weapons as garbage so that you can bulk-sell them once back at a vendor or machine, and you can even do a buyback for the identical price. But what [i]complete idiot[/i] thought it would be a good idea to have the inventory interface move around incessantly? And you need to realize: You'll spend [i]several hours[/i] with this interface, because comparing your guns is a core element of the game.

Then there's the fact that the game will just forget where you have already killed people - they'll just be back on your next visit and loot containers will be refilled, you don't even have to die or reload/restart the game for this. This has upsides, of course, which would be why they decided for this, e.g. now you can keep grinding, and you can enjoy your new toys and your leveled-up character against old foes. It's rather important for balancing that you can't just wipe the world clean. But even though hypothetically, people would repopulate fortresses in reality, you will have to make yourself blind to the feeling that all you're doing is in vain, your actions leave almost no lasting consequence in the world. Just like in real life, right? Except in real life, you don't constantly whip the lands with powerful guns.

What also sucks (but again makes sense, of course) is that you lose a lot of money whenever you die. There will be deaths, though, that are just unnecessary or unfair, or you might even get caught in a loop of dying, which maximizes frustration. This happened to me when I fought Wilhelm and didn't realize that I could just travel away via the obvious terminal. Why didn't I realize? I was mostly blinded by the fact that the arena is a place you can only reach by dropping in from a height that you can't jump, so you can't get out again. This clear message and the fact that I was still relatively new to Borderlands made me blind to the fact that there was an electronic exit right there.

You can't save your game. At least it's not a classic campaign shooter quicksave that bakes every relevant world state detail into a nice file. Instead, you have your character profile which will change as you progress (e.g. incl. money loss from deaths; hint: If you Alt+F4 while you're still dying, nothing is lost.), and it's rather one of those ""general player state"" and ""checkpoint"" saves. On the one hand, this very character of savegame is a good thing: Checkpoints have the clear upside of getting you more involved and making the reality more real because you can't beat it into obedience by saving/loading at your leisure. The downside is: The game completely forgets everything but you. While fortresses have been repopulated when you revisit them even without loading, there are a few aspects of the world that stick - until you exit to main menu or out of the game and then continue playing, that is. It all couldn't revolve [i]more obviously[/i] just around you. 

And there are the quite hard boss fights. Personally, I don't like boss fights, so ignore this paragraph as an actual negative, but I just find them stressful, and what others might misinterpret to be a sense of achievement in me is really just the relief that I managed to overcome this obstacle between me and more of the satisfying gameplay I want to enjoy. You know, like 1990s Eurobeat ""music"" (That I never liked.) where the painful hectic rap was the desert you had to endure before reaching the next fountain, making the refrain ever so slightly better than it actually was. The game does not have a whole lot of boss fights, but I had to throw everything into them and was often very frustrated when I didn't manage, because dying cost me a bunch of cash, and I had to start the fight completely from scratch.

But Borderlands is fun. A well done shoot&loot world to forget yourself in.

Not all Borderlands games have FOV settings, but with some config file editing, you'll always get what you want."
7040,"Borderlands is a great piece of a game.
It's an FPS with mostly RPG elements.

Best to play with friends.
Great play even on singleplayer.

Has a Great Story. Alot of references.
"
7041,Amazing
7042,Played with a friend cant go 10 seconds without having a vietnam flashback of him killing me f*ck you (=KT=)
7043,"So after hours uppon hours of playing borderlands it's finally time for me to do it's review.

What an awesome experience. Before buying this on summer sale I had no idea of how great this game really was. The first 10 minutes of gameplay I was already in love with it. It's just to great to be true.
What can i tell about the game that you don't already know by now. It's this way that games should be done. Completly thinking of the users pleasure. 

PROS:
-amazing gameplay
-ton shit loads of weapons
-funny dialogue
-a little above average story (if you can keep up with it)
-interesting graphics (they are not the best but they sure are good for a change)
-some really interesting mobs and critical hit mechanics
-almost all dlc will be worth your money, mainly if you can get it for the price I did
-good soundtrack
-awesome gameplay 2 feature - google it

Now for the cons, that really break my heart because i'm about to bash the shit out of this:

-repetetive missions
-lack of dialogue, most of the important stuff will be quest written.
-not that many choice on weapons since some are really much stronger than others
-you have to be lucky to drop some stuff, i mean, really lucky. Legendary weapons drop randomly in any mob if i'm not mistaken, so at some point, you are screwd to improve your char if you want to
-boring map design. Just the same textures over and over again.
-lack of customization
-horrible car mechanics
-awful boss fights

After all this being said, i would still give it a 7/   7.5/10. You should defenetly buy and experience thia game.

The best part of doing this review is that i got to see that 90% of the cons i listed were solved on borderlands 2. But that's for anothwr review. BUY BOTH

7045,"Never ending fun, this game is a gem."
7046,GOOD GAME BUY IT PLEZ IT GUD
7047,soo much content
7048,"Boring, terrible gunplay and massive grind fest. Weak arpg in disguise."
7049,"10 out of 10!!! I played this game for at least 200+ hours on Xbox 360 like 2 years ago and decided to buy it on Steam and have currently put in another 100+ hours and I'm still playing it. Borderlands is a truly amazing game, however, this is based on my opinion and style of gameplay. This game is not meant to be realistic in any way!!! It is a humurous RPG, FPS game not meant to be taken too seriously. With thousands of different guns and and a ton of things to shoot, this is still one of my favorite games to this day. I do recommend getting the DLCs for this game because it adds so much more to it!!!"
7050,Worth getting to play with friends... the sequel is much better though
7051,This game is over all a fun messing around game. Yes it may have some bad graphics but its about the time you spend laughing at some of the characters. Basically you go throught and lot the best weapons to be the next boss. Once you have beaten em all then guess what you get to do it again. However they second playthrough its going to be much harder but the weapons drop less often so you may find yourself grinding for a bit to get a good gun. More to come when i finish it on pc
7052,"The game is OK. I give it 6/10. 

It was enjoyable to level the character and gun skills. Although more than half of the skill tree didn't look like something I really wanted to obtain (I played as the Siren). The enemies are interesting and presented good challenge and progression was good.

Traveling was annoying. It felt unenjoyable and in-the-way.

The one thing I absolutely hated is the ending. It was the most anticlimactic thing in the universe and even after I traveled to get the ""reward"" for my final chore, it was the most useless reward ever.

So my suggestion would be that you do get the game, but don't be in a rush to complete it and don't set yourself up expecting a satisfactory ending."
7053,"tl;dr THIS. GAME. IS. JUST. AWESOME.


I can finally say that I finished the game in 100%. Played on every class, wasted lots of hours to master this :P

So, in the game you're so called "" Vault Hunter "" which equals a guy who wants to steal some goodies from the old vault. 
You can pick one of three classes, every of them is uniqie and very fun to play. 
Roland can be both support and killing machine, Scorpio Turret makes everything easier to do.
Mordecai is that type of guy, who is afraid of real warfare and shoots snipers and revolvers only, on long distances. 
Lilith is the run and gun type, loves every elemental weapon you can find. You can also act like you're a ghost with her skill Phasewalk
Brick is another run and gun type, but he just LOVES explosions, rockets and shotguns. He can be played as typical Brick, which means total tank, he can be boxer ( oh yeah, forgot his ability, you're changing to a boxer for a couple of seconds.. ), or rocketeer. 
IMHO, the best charcter both for solo and co-op is Roland, mostly because of his abilities that make him all-rounder. Can play every weapon, resupply ammo, health.. Well, he's a one-man band. 

The whole game looks like this - you take quest, another quest.. oh, another quest! You do them, kill lots of enemies, lvl up, get back to guy who gave you the quest, he gives you some items ( most of them are bad, sadly ) and exp. OH, another lvl up.
This is grinding type of game, someone who likes Diablo will probably like this too, especially due to procedurally generated weapons :P 



Many people say that it's the first Borderlands is the best Borderlands.. well, I can't agree. It feels very weird after playing 2 newer versions, the game feel is completly different. It's good, even very, but it's not the best Borderlands. At least in my opinion. 




OH, ALMOST FORGOT. 
DLCs are awesome, nothing more to say! :D"
7054,cool
7055,recommended
7056,"NOTE: I have finished both borderlands 2 and the pre-sequal, and highly enjoy the borderlands series

With that being said, I cannot recommend Borderlands 1
While it is not a bad game by any means, I find it just not to be any fun

Pros: Good RPG aspects
Crazy amount of weapons
Good amount of enemy types
Some developer charm

Cons: 
Boring, repetitive environments
Simply Dreadful boss fights
An underwhelming story(not very interesting to the player)
Performance issues: Can't hold a steady 60fps even on a 960
Dull missions(quality over quantity please)

7058,If you like RPG games and FPS games then you will certainly like this game.  I just finished it and had a blast playing it.  Now on to Borderlands 2.
7059,"Take the most boring parts of the MMO genre, add a very limited array of characters and enemies, bad and boring level design – seriously, how often can you get stuck in the environment – and finish it of with sloppy controls: the result is Borderlands. Why this was ever I thing, I'll never know."
7060,"I prefer it less than the second, prefer it over Pre-Sequel. Worth getting, i had a blast playing through it once. Got it cheap, worth getting for the epic gunzzz!"
7061,Crazy game with crazy comic graphics !
7062,"Borderlands was one of the first game I got on the Xbox 360 and was one of the first games I got on my PC a few years later, and I love this game so much, the story of it, the originality of this game, was amazing, being able to play as a Soilder with a automated turret, a huge hulking guy that can beat the living crap out of anyone, a hunter that has an amazing little bird that attacks anyone or a superhuman woman who can phasewalk and kill people just by reamerging.

Borderlands 1 was the start of something amazing and my one of my favorite franchises to date, if you want to get into the Borderlands games, play this one first."
7063,who doesn't love this game?
7064,I love it when the DLC is better executed than the core game!
7065,"Highly addictive and still feels fresh in 2016, years after its initial release.
It's best features are the guns and the characters.
Guns are totally random in this game and finding your next favorite is an incredible feeling.
Shooting is highly satisfying in this game.
The characters, NPCs and Player Characters, are all unique and hilarious.
Would recommend to shooter fans and RPG fans, if not everyone."
7066,Gotta catch em' all!
7067,"I think I'm really weird.

I hated every part of this game. From the Fetch and return missions to the NPC's that only have VO for one line that they'll repeat ad infinum, the incredibly tiny variation in enemies (bandit, big bandit, dwarf bandit, gay bandit, dog thing, big dog thing, dwarf dog thing, etc). Then there's the fantastic groundbreaking art style...brown.  Every shade of brown you can think of is in there, from light all the way up to a little darker brown. The guns, millions of them, and each kind has basically two models just with dumb super soaker colours mixed in, ah but they have different stats, that mean zero if you just get a high physical weapon and stop fussing with the elemental damage.  But wait there's also cool cars to drive... that all look the same, perform the same and steer like go carts. The ""humour"" is cringeworthy, like painfully crickets chirping bad.  Lets not forget the fantastic story... um, there's a vault somewhere that you'll find if you do like a hundred favours for people. I mean just shoot them in the knee caps and tell them to do it themselves, NO i will not go and get you dog food! The awesome soundtrack consists of a looped country western thing that just plays endlessly. I mean I honestly only got this far into it because I hate not finishing games. How in the name of all things holy did this spawn 2 sequels and a telltale game? Oh and claptrap? What a cheap knockoff of gir from Invader Zim.

And people dissed RAGE for being desolate and boring? LMAO"

7074,"[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine [/h1]

Yes, even after 15 hours or more of playing Borderlands, I've still haven't completed the game. Borderlands is filled with adventure to explore and survive and with the additional DLC, it increases the playtime to a hundred. Thus, I have decided to be fair, since I haven't fully completed the story and I do not intend to due to the amount of games I have and also because this game is freaking long, I've decided to set this as a first impressions review and not a full review

Borderlands is a game developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games. The game is a first person action game where you loot as many items as possible and have a huge line-up of guns and stuff. The story takes place in the fictional world of Pandora and you have the objective of searching for the hidden treasures of Pandora

There is a many story to follow, but Borderlands has so many side missions and places to explore, you will surely loose track of playing the main mission

The gameplay is simple, you shoot as much enemies as possible, grab their loot and upgrade to make your arsenal as good as possible. Over the course of the game, you get to explore parts of Pandora whilst taking contracts and following the story. To be honest, there were so many side missions that I kind of gave up with following the main story and I will just go onto YouTube and watch the ending there

Borderlands is known for it's shell shaded graphics and I must say that it really does make the game unique in its on way. The sound effects and animations especially during gunplay is amazing and so satisfying. The only thing I would complain about is the music, it's so depressing and low that it made me not want to play the game. So much so that I turned off the music and played my own

That is the thing I would complain about Borderlands, there are so many side missions that it is possible to completely forget about the main storyline of the game. To be honest, the game's storyline isn't the best I've seen. The characters are amazing and all have different character traits. My favourite has to be Claptrap who has such a wonderful attitude and makes you always smile after a difficult mission

The game is not easy, and as your progress through the XP system, the harder the missions get. So much so, you will die over and over again until you have enough XP to be properly upgraded to tackle the mission at hand. I thing I've got to complain about is the amount of back tracking the game has. Once you get a contract/mission, you go, fight the enemies and finish the objectives, then go all the way back and get your reward. And this is how the game is over and over again, the amount of back tracking really makes me not want to continue playing the game

And that is just one aspect why I do not want to continue playing Borderlands. I feel like I have played so much of it that I feel that I have satisfied myself enough to move onto Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel which are lying in my library waiting to be played

Whilst you're reading this review, you may be thinking to yourself, ""God, he's complaining a lot about the game"", and in one aspect yes. Borderlands has some things that really make me want to complain about it. But on the other hand, the statisfying gunplay and character development was so good that it made me want to continue. But I personally felt that after the 15 hours or so of gameplay, I can't play anymore of Borderlands

Borderlands is a completionist's wet dream. To explore the planet and collecting sweet loot is amazing, but for a casual gamer like me who likes to start and finish a game and move on, Borderlands is a fantastic game but not a game I can finish

Borderlands is not for everyone but it is a game everyone should give a try and see if it's the game for them or not

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]"
7075,"This game just never gets old to me. I've played through it I don't know how many times and it's still fun and funny. Can't get behind Borderlands 2 nearly as much as this one. Definitely worth a look. Just GET IT, Already!! You won't be disappointed."
7076,Nice and Atmospheric!
7077,"What Borderlands does better than anything is establish something deep and compelling quickly and with very little material. Though it might be more accurate to say that Borderlands is just very good at standing on the shoulders of giants. With clever use of archetypes, characters feel fully developed from the word go. The same can be said about the world of Pandora in which description is supplanted by an evocative soundtrack. There is no exposition detailing any of this depth, but the game still manages to imply it. Part of the reason this does nothing to disrupt the suspension of disbelief is that story is not at the game's center. Borderlands is about running around, killing varied enemies with varied weakpoints, and sorting through an infinite selection of weapons for the best one; anything else is secondary. None of that is terribly original, but every part of it is just so competently executed that it's a joy all the same. The little details the game does add, mostly through skippable mission dialogues, serve best as the context that leaves old, tedious actions feeling new and exciting. The RPG elements, namely the character skills, do much to relieve that tedium as well while also doing more to explain who the player characters are than any biography could. 
The four DLC packs do attempt to fill in some of the blanks left behind by the game's 'on-the-go' design philosophy, each with surprising extensive additions, Mad Moxxi's Underdome excluded. That pack does include a needed banking system, but unless you love the shooting aspect of Borderlands so much that you're aching to do it in one of three small arenas for hordes on hordes of the same enemies, it would be better to skip that one. The other three, however, add and flesh out new characters along with developing old ones, all clocking in at around three to five hours each. While they do stand as worthy expansions of the main game's content, they just can't match the amount of flavor and enjoyment the main game has to offer. It's a bit of a shame then that this 7-year-old game isn't going to be getting anymore plot-hole filling expansions at this point, but that disappointment only goes to show how well it's aged and how much it still has to offer."
7078,Borderlands becomes a game of collecting items with more numbers than the numbers you have and using them to shoot at bullet sponge enemies with no repercussions for dying.
7079,The best borderlands game
7080,Funny but also a serious game with real strat in its own way. Great game
7081,Incredibly fun and addicting. Great for calming down.
7082,"Badass game. (""Pun"" not intended and probably people who played will understand)."
7083,Incredible game with high replay value.
7084,"[i] “If it took more than one shot, you weren't using a Jakobs.” [/i]

Borderlands is a first-person looter shooter game, and represents the first entry in Gearbox Software's Borderlands game series.

[i] Pros & cons: [/i]

+ Elaborate loot system creates a broad spectrum of weapons and items that support different play styles. Well done online collaborative campaign gameplay allows for a flexible and fluent multiplayer experience. 

+ The unusual, humoristic events and cinematic moments contribute to the game’s atmosphere. Selected illustration of stereotypical side characters with a cynical attitude and wry sense of humour.

o Each of the four addons introduces a challenging mini-campaign. Solid sound design and voice acting.   

- Repetitive side missions offer little variety; ranging from go-get-it-boy-and-bring-it-back, over collect-all-the-stuff-I-dropped to kill-a-bazillion-of-those. Simple storyline; as if a lobotomized zombie has been given a pen to smear down a one-liner.  

[i] Summary: [/i]

Borderlands is an entertaining FPS experience with over-the-top humoristic moments, and the right amount of loot collecting aspects. However, the paper-thin story remains uninteresting and most of the monotonous side quests lack long-term motivation. 

[i] Achievements: [/i]

Estimated time for 100 % completion: +60 hours

Singleplayer achievements: 72
Multiplayer achievements: 8"
7085,Better than 2 imo
7086,"This game is fantastic from what I've played so far. Unfortunately however, the STEAM version of this game has a memory leak that may affect you. The retail version on the other hand does not.

It does not seem to be too widespread of an issue but I'm posting this review to make sure you're aware. Personally, I'd buy the retail version since it gives you a tool allowing you to also get the Steam version as well if you wish and it means you won't have to refund the game if you have this issue. (Also comes with Steam GOTY code if you buy GOTY version on the backpage of the manual).

Before you play more than 2 hours, see if your frames are dropping more and more if you play. If so, refund the game or try one of the various fixes online including deleting your 3D Vision Drivers (Not needed) and verifying your game cache, both of which did not work for me.

Please note that it probably will work for you and it is a brilliant game but CHECK this issue before playing more than 2 hours to be able to refund it if the issue is there.

EDIT:
For me, the framerate would start at 150 and slowly go down until about 15 frames where I would restart the game. This was staying in one place not moving at all. Also, Steam asks me to choose whether I recommend this game or not. Theres no: ""Depends"" and I can't recommend a game that didn't work for me and other people with no real fix."

7090,"This was my very first game that I complete the whole story in, that was not a search and find or other puzzle type game... 
I really enjoyed it, as trying and angering as it was sometimes, I managed to get passed..."
7091,"Fun, borderline, simple, efficient.

Visuals are ok and propose a different approach to the usual realistic FPS.

Totally recommend it."
7092,Bloodwing is so kawaii
7093,??? WORST game i have ever played.
7094,Some of the characters are design to normalize lgbt.

[h1][b]General Impression[/b][/h1]
[quote]Borderlands is a great combination of the FPS and RPG genres, which mixed up would get a RPS (Role-Play Shooter). I had a lot of fun with this game. Off to the features: The graphics and the textures are pretty nice, they are 3D cartoonish, and well-designed. The atmosphere is huge, there are many maps to explore and to complete their quests. Many of them are side quests, which are not mandatory, but you need to complete some of them, in order to level up with the quests’ level requirements. You can kill enemies around the maps, doing the quests, or simply riding with your car. The audio, the voice acting and the music are fine. The gameplay is nice, there are a ton of missions, and they differ a lot, which is a good thing. You can kill a lot of diversified enemies, you can explore areas, you can ride your car and do stunts, you can buy from machine vendors whatever you want, and many others. The story is interesting, you can play with up to 4 different characters (Ronald, Mordecai, Lilith and Brick). I won’t spoil what’s happening in it, but 1 thing is sure: if you are going to play with all of them, you would basically spend a ton of hours (more than 200). Without the DLCs. I haven’t tried out the DLCs, but from what I saw on YouTube, they are pretty great. I recommend that you buy the GOTY edition of the game. This game also has a CO-OP option, where you can play with up to 3 friends (4 in the game). The user-interface is pretty nice, with additional designs and well-synthetized information. The controls are well-chosen. The engines are alright, I haven’t found any haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are pretty sophisticated, except with one thing: from time to time, you will get stuck in random objects, but it isn’t hard to get out of them. Overall, Borderlands is a nice combination of the FPS and RPG genres, which mixed up would get a RPS (Role-Play Shooter). A fun game! Made with love![/quote]

7096,"Since this games first trailer was released, years and years ago, I've been excited for the games content and what it had to bring, and I had a lot of expectations for this game, which were all met. Now, this game hasn't exactly aged well but if you don't mind graphics that lack in variety, but enjoy gameplay and co-op fun, you will love this game!"
7097,"Being a Borderlands 2 fan originally, I came into this game expecting a product inferior to its successor. However, I found that Borderlands is a fun and engrossing game that rivals Borderlands 2 in almost every way. I enjoyed experiencing the title that gave the Borderlands universe its start and found it had a quality story, challenging gameplay, and the same vast expanse of weapons that are signature of the franchise. I would recommend this game whether you are new to the Borderlands games or even if you've already played the second game.

My praises aside, there were a few things that I found to be disappointing. This game is not as good as Borderlands 2. The story is interesting throughout, but ends abruptly and has little payout for all the work you did to get there. Secondly, the locations do not vary greatly from one another. The entirety of the game takes place in the same sort of desert environment, with very few exceptions. Finally, the last big thing that I found to be a flaw was the lack of customization. You're characters have very limited options in terms of skills and all the skills feel very inconsequential in terms of changing the gameplay. The skills generally just gives buffs to your character rather than change how you'd play. This lack of customization also carries through to the appearance of your character and vehicles, which is a bit of a nuisance.

Overall, I found this to be a great game and is definitely something a recommend checking out."
7098,For the glory of King WeeWee.
7099,"This game from Intro to completion I enjoyed to include the DLC.  You will see alot of positive reviews about this product, I personnally enjoyed the graphic styling, quirky characters, the missions and game play.

I have no reservations recommending it as a first person shooter game with story.  The story does get weak in places, but gameplay and characters i found generally carried it through.  I did beat game and enjoyed it."
7100,"The very first shooter I fell in love with really hard! And I still am! I really love the style and graphics, the rough touch. 

It took me quiet some time to drive the stupid cars properly but now I'm not even afraid about a real license anymore. 
"
7101, ...
7102,The trailer is rubbish. The game is awesome. To really get an idea of what this game is like you need to play it or watch a video of someone playing it.
7103,"Borderlands game is my favorite game for this moment, I bought the game on this week and I just cant stop playing it, the game the game features a funny story, The quality of the game is very beautiful, The colors of the game are striking and fascinating, And the story of the game is just WOW, borderlands game doesn't look like all shooting games you have known until now. The quality of the game is unique, and thats what makes borderlands so special in my opinion, you should try this game, I rate 100/100

"
7104,4/5 stars why not five you might ask? it doesnt have that damn 4th chaos emerald
7105,"I played it for ages on the ps3 but its better on pc great game. Its wacky and has very enjoyable gameplay
This game is still really fun many years on the graphics still look good due to the cell shaded style and the gameplay is enjoyable as ever and much more fun when you have friends along for the ride"
7106,"Good game, the story was a little bit shorter by my taste.

Now the fun part
DESTRUCTION, CORROSION, FIRE AND CRITICALS!!!!. If you are looking for a game fun to play(especially with friends, Borderlands wont let you down.

11/10 Would kill moar riders and skags. XD"
7107,I haven't played this game much but its a great game.
7108,I have played this game multiple times
7109,"Borderlands with its wacky style, easy to pick up gunplay, and addicting loot system has always made me come back occasionally with a couple of friends just to enjoy a fun videogame again. I've seen some criticism of the borderlands series as a whole, and I am convinced that if you are looking for a more serious and realistic shooter, you will indeed be underwhelmed by these games. But if you want to have fun, silly, and balls to the walls type of shooter you cannot pass this game up. 

It was easily worth $60 when it first came out, you bet your ass its worth at least 30 today, and you would be insane if you didnt snatch this title when it gets marked down for under $10. Also its worthy of note to mention that you want to play with a friend, not because the game does not stand up well on its own, but playing with a friend turns borderlands from a good gaming experience to a great one. Pick this up if you havent already, its a good play."
7110,"İ am sure it's a cool game.
But i  started Borderlans series with Borderlands 2 then i tried to play first game.
then i played second game again .
and now I cant play first game anymore.
"
7111,"Awesome game, best one in the series to me.
BL: 9.5/10
BL2: 9/10
prequal: 4/10

Good mysterious lore, great fun, great loot, great replayability, great char building. just get the game you skaglover."
7112,"Hi

I loved this game when I was younger. Still spend a lot of time in it. There is no real problem with the game for me but would have loved a little bit more fast travel stations with the DLC's."
7113,Simply put the most excellent game series ever created and being the one that started it all this game is a must over and over again.  I have played this game so many times between different consoles that i have lost count. It is the go to game even when new games have been purhcased.  It has always been fun even when repetetive. My youngest son (11) has caught the Borderlands bug and there is truly no cure; just more Borderlands. The DLC's are un believable and a must. This verrsion on pc is so outstanding and so well optimized that most any computer even one built with parts from 2005 can play this thing mostly maxed out. If you dont like thig game you probably are not alive!
7114,"Honestly, am so disappointed with this game after hearing all the hype. Is really boring! From what i've seen it's just a series of tick box fetch quests with hardly any story progression. The comic book art style is cool but it lacks all the other stuff that makes games great."
7115,"Somewhat interesting, slightly boring at times. FOV locked to 75, which gives me headaches to look at, and cannot be changed in-game. You need to bind it to a key in the files and press it every time you enter a new area or, indeed, after sprinting or aiming down the sights.

Meh rating, slightly leaning on 'no'. Steam needs a 'barely recommended' rating."
7116,"Really awesome game, highly recommend if you like to mess around and enjoy the crazy characters :P Gameplay is great too, but Claptrap will piss you off eventually"
7117,"Guns, Loot, skags, Guns, Loot, Mad moxxi, Loot........ aaaand guns"
7118,very mice if i could get into the dlc that took me 4 months then the shit door never opens
7119,"Incredible customization, action and great environments (-:"
7120,Gearbox finaly does something good/10
7121,"This game made me like FPS

10/10 would jump over P.iss Wash gully again"
7122,Ooooooo yeaaaaa!!!!
7123,Guns. Humor. Guns. Great story. Guns. Awesome combat. Guns. Easy to use interface. Oh and did i mentions Guns!
7124,recommend
7125,"It is a bit odd going from Borderlands 2 down to Borderlands 1. There are some things which you take for granted in Borderlands 2 which do not appear in this game i.e. automatic looting of health packs and a decent map.

That being said, the game is actually fantastic. It may take a while to get used to it after playing Borderlands 2, but once you get there you WILL have a ton of fun.

Highly recommended, particuarly if you pick this up at a discount price."
7126,This is one of the games that will keep you awake for days!!
7127,"i want to be friend
"
7128,Really fun I have beaten it several times now and the only problem I have with it is that I can't skip the opening cutscene
7129,Love this game. Borderlands series would be my favourite series I own on steam. Absolutely recommend the game.
7130,"Great game!  An RPG FPS?!  A lot of fun to play, but even better with friends."
7131,"There's something adicting about this game,that makes you come back to it despite its slight repetitivenes.A 7.5/10 imo.
"
7132,"Bought this during sales, so worth it!!"
7133,one of the best games i ve ever played
7134,"Although I'm not a big fan of shooters, I enjoyed Borderlands.  The cartoonish graphics and humor placed throughout the game meant that it didn't take itself too seriously.  I don't know what prompted me to buy it, knowing it's a shooter, but I'm glad I did.  I'm more into RPGs, simulators, and adventure games, and Borderlands has some elements of these; maybe that's why I was drawn to it.  Generally, shooters turn me off because I don't have the reflexes of a hyperactive adolescent to survive very long.  But Borderlands offers a somewhat non-linear play style--I hate games where you just run through a tunnel from start to end, even if it's carefully disguised to not look like a tunnel.  If a particular mission is too difficult, then choose a couple of different missions until you level up enough to get past the difficult mission.  I did that when I tried to battle Skagzilla.  I just couldn't survive even a few seconds worth of battle with this thing, so I went on to other things and came back later in the game.   Unfortunately, some of the boss missions must be completed to open the next map.  But once you figure out their weaknesses, it's not too hard to get past most of the bosses.  For example, I just stood by the entrance door to Sledge's lair and slowly weakened him over time.  Yes, most (but not all) bosses, you can leave the battle, do other stuff like refill your ammo and health, then return."
7135,"you grind to get stuff

not that hard to understand"
7136,molto bello
7137,i Love Borderlands
7138,9/11 would bush again.
7139,"TL;DR A superb open-world game, blend of FPS and RPG. Lots of shooting, fighting, hunting, and explosions. Rewarding gameplay.

+Lots of weapons
+RPG aspects
+Rewards tactical planning
+Good progression system
+Nice unique art style

-Checkpoint based saving that only saves your state and not your location
-Some sections are repetitive
-The “story” is not much of a story

About the game
-----------------
Borderlands is an experiment in blending RPG with FPS in an open-world setting which worked out really well. Its a charming shooter with every element of shooters in it, but also ensures a balanced level of sanity through its open-world and RPG features. In this game you play the role of a (or a group of in co-op mode) mercenary(s) with the mission of finding the legendary “vault” – a repository of advanced alien technology in the planet of Pandora. Pandora however have been mined and exploited by large interplanetary corporations through means of cheap convict labor. The corporations have left the planet releasing the convicts on their departure, which has resulted in bandit run madness and chaos. The convict turned bandits and Pandora’s dangerous wildlife make survival difficult in this planet.You have to get rid of such bandits and monsters in your quest for the vault. Eventually you will also have to face the military forces of one of the corporations who want the vault contents for themselves. Along your journey you earn skill points, learn new skills, upgrade your weapons (there are lots and lots of them) and gear and become more and more fearsome.  The setting is the planet Pandora which resembles vast post apocalyptic wastelands with some mountainous terrains, caves, and canyons as well. There are story missions and side missions which can be received from various characters or bounty boards strewn across the various in-game locations. There is a vehicle for transport and a fast travel system although most mission specific locations are inaccessible to vehicles and have to be traversed on foot. Gears, weapons and first aid can be bought and sold in vending machines across the lands. If you like both FPSs and RPGs, then this is a must-play game for you.

---------------

Gameplay – Gameplay is generally good and rewarding. Death is not permanent – neither for you, nor for most of your enemies, i.e. enemies usually re-spawn except specific villain characters tied to the story’s progression. XP can be thus farmed but it is not really necessary as there are enough side-missions for leveling up purposes. The only tricky part in the gameplay is the checkpoint based save system. It only saves your current state and does not save your current location. If you die (in the same session) you are relocated to your nearest checkpoint; however if you quit your session then you are relocated from your nearest spawn point (spawn points are sparser than checkpoints) and also all enemies re-spawn. Apart from the save system, gameplay is good and enjoyable in every other aspect.

Graphics – Good with its own unique art style.

Performance – Good.

Entertainment – Blowing up heads with shotgun or sniper rifles is all the entertainment. Also burning enemies or striking them down with electric shocks.

Plot (if applicable) – The plot is cliched and shallow.

Replay value – There is good replay value, as you have four different characters to play as and also there is a second playthrough mode.

Immersion – Not much to speak of in this department. It is definitely not one of the most immersive games out there.

Overall it is a solid, meaty, and enjoyable experience."
7140,Uno de esos juegos que nacen clásicos.
7141,"(WARNING: POTENTIAL SPOILERS)

Since this game has been out for 7 years, I'm only going to mention stuff that I feel others didn't touch on. 

I actually beat the entire game. It was my first time playing it. It was fun. There are over 100 missions on the core game (without the DLCs) alone. Taking your time with the core game alone, the full game runs at about 55 hours. The three DLCs (minus Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot, which I talk about below) adds about 20-30 hours to the core game.

I have a few criticisms:

1) I did not like the music. It wasn't bad, but I didn't feel like it matched the animation of the game. Add to that, they were all very ominous and daunting like the Fallout 3 DLC ""The Pitt"" and a) it can get exhausting listening to it for 55 hours, but also b) The scenes change in the game, yet the dreary tone of the music doesn't.

2) You aren't allowed to pick your mode of play (easy, normal, hard/normal, hard, very hard). After I beat the game once as a soldier, I wanted to play a different class (siren) on a harder level/mode, but unfortunately that wasn't an option. If you want the game to get more difficult, you have to beat the game but the caveat is that you can't play on a more difficult mode as a class you haven't beaten the game with, which defeats the purpose of wanting to play other classes with a challenge.

3) Checkpoints in regular game/""core"" game act as checkpoints should. Checkpoints in DLCs ONLY act as checkpoints if you die. They don't bring you back to your last checkpoint if you restart/reboot the game which is inconvenient because then you have to spend anywhere from 5-30 minutes making your way back to where you want to start from again.

4) Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot is an archaic DLC. If you want to know why, check my review on that too.

P.S. Steam's review process is defective. I tried submitting the review multiple times days ago and it wouldn't work.

+Review updated over two months later.
+Credit to me."
7142,"Randy Pitchford is a scumbag and actually made Jon St. John record the line ""Bazinga."" Don't buy/play GearBox games."
7143,"Beyond the FPS, the story has excellent writing and humor. I love the world they created and playing in it is a great time."
7144,"Two words, It's Borderlands!"
7145,"Name a game that has 87 bazillion guns.

Name a game that has screaming, flaming, insane midgets with improbably good hatchet throws.

Name a game where coming out of invisibility makes all nearby enemies confused, electrocuted, slowed, on fire, exploded, and covered in acid.

Name a game where a robot that sounds like Bill Cipher won't shut up about his dance moves whenever you're looking at new quests.

Name a game where a guy flips off the camera in the first minute of gameplay.

Name a game with as many pop culture references as Skullgirls.

Welcome to Pandora. The midget population growth needs to be curbed, and you have plenty of weapons to do so. 
Have fun.

Incendiery Rocket Shotgun/10"
7146,"Thia game is amazing, it has so much difference in weapons and the proficiencies(?) give it a more 'realistic' way of playing.
It'a nice to level up with your weapons, because in the beginning it was annoying that so many shots were missed, but the more you level, the better the accuracy etc become on your weapons.
10/10 and the CO-OP is amazing :)"
7147,"I'm so freaking angry at this game. The character feels really stiff to control, the combat is boring, there's no story, it takes an ungodly amount of time to finish, they prolong the story so goddamned much with ""oh you want something from me? well you have to do something for me"" which boils down to ""kill this guy for me,"" or , ""kil these monsters for me,"" or ,""hunt down these items for me,"" IT'S ALL THE FUCKING SAME! It gets really aggravating when the story is going nowhere and you want to finish already but you still have a hell of a ways to go and on top of that you have to be a higher and higher level to do the missions, so if you're underleveled you have to grind doing boring ass side missions or get ass fucked by the numerous bullet sponges for enemies. And for a game that is all about treasure hunting, you know how much treasure you find? Zero. Zilch. Nada. The only things you can find by exploring are guns, ammo, and wads of money. But what about the vault? Well, hold on, that's the most disappointing part! After you drag yourself through this game and get the vault and kill the final boss, you get a huge whopping shit ton of FUCKING NOTHING! NOTHING! THERE'S NOTHING IN THE VAULT! FUCK THIS GAME! I really, REALLY hope that the sequel is actually any good because I bought this game and the sequel based on the good things I had heard."
7148,Beautifuly crafted game that is fun to play years after it's been released.  I started over just today and played for probably 4 hours straight loving every minute of it.  :)

7150,"Fun and start of Borderlands legend, nice to know all story."
7151,"The best Borderlands! I love the gameplay and i love how easy and simple the controls are! 









I hate claptrap though."
7152,Open world + steampunk = GOOD GAME.
7153,Not borderlands it's crashinglands becuse the game crash often. really dont buy a game that can't work.
7154,I should make it very very clear that the hours I've put into this game are no where near whatever it says on my profile...I've easily played over a thousand hours in this game prior to getting it and playing it on Steam.
7155,"Borderlands is an overall amazing game, it has LOTS of guns, rocket launchers, snipers, smg, revolvers, pistols you name it, if you are looking for an action packed game with a great adventure and funny/dark humour that is an RPG with 4 different characters to choose from  then you've come to the right place"
7156,"Started playing Borderlands as Mordecai and somehow got stuck at some point.
So I started playing Borderlands 2 and fell in love with the game. 
After some time I saw Mordecai in Bl2 and I liked Lilith, so I thought maybe you could play her in Borderlands, too.
Long story short:
Came back because of Lilith."
7157,I downloaded borderlands 2 a few months ago because i heard it was a great game after playing it for a few hours i lost interest it was too confusing didn't have a clue what was going on too much happening on screen didnt understand the story deleted it.  I downloaded borderlands recently wasn't expecting much haven't stopped playing totally addictive good story so far alot clearer cant wait to finish it and play the sequel awesome now i understand the hype just need people to play with online anyone?
7158,"Amazing game with priceless humour, great story and beautiful guns!"
7159,"Borderlands is an amazing game and I have enjoyed every minute of gameplay. I can see why this game would have mixed reception considering it is an open-world sandbox game, but it doesn't feel like there's much to do. How can a game not have much to do and still be fun? Well, it's a very charming a unique game. It blends comic book-like visuals with quirky humor and great cast of characters to create one fun experience that didn't wear out for me but may vary for others.

The majority of the time you're looking at bounty boards to receive the next side mission and some of them can be rather bland fetch quests which could feel repetitive. However, I purchased the game of the year edition during the summer sale and thought it was worth every penny. I recently finished the zombie DLC and LOVED it haha. Overall, I would give this game a solid 8.5/10"
7160,"The absent FOV-settings makes this unbearable to play for any longer than 2 minutes.
Even if you configure it, it will reset once you melee. Just another console port."
7161,"This is one of my all time favorite games, whenever I'm bored I can always come back to it. It has great humor and awesome gameplay, and is great for a group of friends. The DLC are excellent but aren't required to make it a good game, I definitely got my moneys worth and more."
7162,"1. Loot
2. Level
3. Beat game
4. Become disapointed
5. Realize game overall was A1
6. Play dlc's
7. Gain more satisfaction
8. Repeat once more
9. Level to 50
10. Kill Raid boss
11. Gain loot satisfaction 
12. Move onto Borderlands 2 (Essential)"
7163,"great game to just get lost in, Borderlands 2 is a ofc better but this is an awesome game aswell"
7164,Amazing. An all time personal favorite. Highly recommend!
7165,gr8 game r8 8/8
7166,"Borderlands is fun to play with your friends, or alone, or with your pet, or with the elders of your family. Just play borderlands, you won't regret it."
7167,"Very nice game, good story, lots of fun and doesn't take itself too serious. Even better in multiplayer!"
7168,"this game has everything you need in your life, friendly CL4P-TP's; cute boxer, caveman, kamikaze and soldier CL4P-TP's that try to kill you; GUNS; various kinds of bandits; various kinds of Psychos that yell things like ""TIME...FOR MY POUND OF FLESH"",""STRIP THE FLESH, SALT THE WOUND!"", ""time to play...TIME TO PLAY!"" (just love that sh<3t); SCOOTER; MORE GUNS; Marcus' sh<3tty guns and more. 

so you know...buy this game already! 

[spoiler]srsly...buy it[spoiler]"
7169,"I love this game! I'm only 10ish hours in so far but it has me hooked, I've only been playing for 3 days and I just keep wanting to come back.  The game is pretty polished although a few of the enemy noises (notably the psychos) can get a little repetitive.  Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a decently long, not horribly difficult, and hilarious game.  I cant wait to make second and third playthroughs."
7170,"An interesting start to a franchise that's grown so large. Unless you're a hardcore Borderlands fan, I'd recommend skipping it. Save yourself the trouble of dealing with a game that has not aged well over the past couple of years. It's probably worth it to skip right to 2 or the Pre-Sequel. Did I enjoy my time playing? Yes, but I'm admittedly pretty invested in the Borderlands universe. I can't say that someone with not as much commitment into these games would want to even bother with this one."
7171,10/10
7172,"This is OG borderlands. Its simple, fun and great to play with friends. The guns keep gameplay fresh and enemies can be challenging at some points. If you want a simple FPS-RPG you wont be disapointed with borderlands."
7173,"The flagship of a revolution. This game marked a turn in First-Person shooters. It seamlessly blended Shooter and RPG elements to create a fast paced run'n'gun at times, and forces you to take a more tactical approach at others. A gem of gaming history, Borderlands is a must have for RPG lovers and Shooter overs alike. 

Pros:
LOOT- Its like Christmas everytime you open a chest!
Enemy types- There is no shortage of different bandits and creatures, all with their own particular weaknesses.
Replayability- If you get tired of your current tactics, your entire playstyle can change by selecting a new character.
Atmosphere- The everchanging environment is absolutely beautiful, and it too can change your tactical approach.
Absurd Humor- Gruesome LOLZ =D

Cons:
Enemy Mechanics- Sometimes they're absolutely stupid, and other times they're overpowered with pinpoint accuracy. 
Stuff- Not much else, really

"
7174,This is a very good start to franchise that has become one of the most famous and fun of it's generation.
7175,"Probably one most fun game played in my book 
a recommend to get game good story 
also 4 awesome characters beat the game 13 times  8 times on ps3 5 times xbox 360"
7176,"An open-world RPG based on the Alien wasteland known as Pandora. I'll admit that i'm not the hugest fan of this game, but I'll put that down to a lack of hours put into it.

If you've ever played the Fallout series, you'll be used to the running around, completing objectives, finding new and more powerful weapons to combine with your ""skill level"" style of gameplay. Borderlands takes a leaf from this book, adding some new interesting characters and features to the game. 

The Cooperative feature is the hidden gem in this game, which offers a whole new style of gameplay for you and a friend to delve into the open world together, and explore, fight alongside each other, and later argue intently over who truely needed that ""insta-health pack"" more.

The cartoonish feel to the game may appeal to majority of people who purchase this game, and as we've learnt from the likes of Minecraft, graphics aren't the be-all and end all of the game.

As I mentioned at the start of this review. I'm not an overly huge fan, but I can understand the appeal, and wouldn't deem this a ""bad game"", but just not my first choice. I really hope a few more logged hours might change that feeling."
7177,"I really like Cell-shaded Fallout





























BTW: no GF again. ;) thanks rpg's"
7178,"Pretty alright. Doesn't age well and is a very rough console port, but it's still a solid game."
7179,"The first game in a very good series, Borderlands is an incredibly fun game for those who are into co-op RPGs. The original featured, in my opinion, some of the best characters, notably Brick. To give you an idea of how seriously this game takes itself, selecting Brick and leveling up allows you to pull out your fists every 30 seconds and imbue them with the power of corrosion or fire. Yeah.
Since it's 2016 and both Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel have come out, the game's mechanics can feel a bit outdated, but if you're looking to buy Borderlands 2 I definitely recommend purchasing this first to get some backstory. Full of humor, drama, and exciting gameplay, Borderlands ranks as one of the best modern-day RPGs. Play this if you enjoyed Dead Island or Skyrim."
7180,"I was walking down the street,
When out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said ""I've never seen a man
Who looks so all alone,
Could you use a little company?
If you pay the right price
Your evening will be nice,
And you can go and send me on my way.""
I said ""You're such a sweet young thing
Why you do this to yourself?""
She looked at me and this is what she said,

""Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked,
Money don't grow on trees.
I got bills to pay,
I got mouths to feed,
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
I know I can't slow down,
I can't hold back,
Though you know, I wish I could.
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked,
Until we close our eyes for good"".

Not even fifteen minutes later
I'm still walking down the street,
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out of sight.
And then he swept up from behind
He put a gun up to my head,
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight.
He said ""Give me all you've got
I want your money not your life,
But if you try to make a move I won't think twice.""
I told him ""You can have my cash
But first you know I got to ask
What made you want to live this kind of life?""

He said ""There ain't no rest for the wicked,
Money don't grow on trees.
I got bills to pay,
I got mouths to feed,
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
I know I can't slow down,
I can't hold back,
Though you know, I wish I could.
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked,
Until we close our eyes for good"".

Now a couple hours passed
And I was sitting at my house,
The day was winding down and coming to an end.
So I turned on the TV
And flipped it over to the news,
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend.
I saw a preacher man in cuffs he'd taken money from the church,
He stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills.
But even still I can't say much
Because I know we're all the same,
Oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills.

You know, there ain't no rest for the wicked,
Money don't grow on trees.
We got bills to pay,
We got mouths to feed,
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
I know we can't slow down,
We can't hold back,
Though you know, we wish we could.
No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
Until we close our eyes for good"
7181,"This game holds a special place in my heart. It was one of the very first games I ever 100% enjoyed, and still do to this day after 5 or 6 so years have gone by since first playing it. It gives me and I'm sure countless others that adrenaline rush that many games these days do not give. 
If you enjoy killing things nonstop, this is the game for you.
If you have always wanted to see what its like to play a game where developers have left bugs and glitches in a game on purpose, this is the game for you.
If you want a perfect combination of comedy, gore and action, this is the game for you.
Borderlands and Borderlands 2 go hand in hand, and are in my opinion two of if not the best games created. 

Also if you're looking for a farming companion hit me up on Steam :"")"
7182,Played Borderlands 2 and the Presequel before this. The graphics held up pretty well considering its a few years old now. A good 20+ hours of playtime without the DLC. Very glad I decided to go back and play this.
7183,Bought the game in a $10 deal with BL2 after playing it at a mates and loved it the DLCs get too repeditive and the game looks quite bleak and it pales in comparison to BL2 but still a freaking sweet game.
7184,"I love this game !

Its not that difficult with the hunter but a real challenge with the siren ! The DLC is good and levels with your character so you can do it at any level. Turn the volume up and have a laugh !"
7185,This game is cool
7186,"Borderlands is an amazing open world game that combines RPG elements with FPS elements and gun RNG.... it works. World is intreasting and lots of side quests to do and lots, lots and lots of guns to find in the world. 

8.5/10"

7191,I love this game so much.
7192,noice
7193,"Finished the game on Xbox, decided to replay on pc. Graphics are definitely different than most shooters and there's more comedy than serious moments. Controls are a bit weird and if you ever leave the game for lengthy periods you might as well start over."
7194,this game hella boring
7195,"Funny characters and quests, interesting classes, and tons and tons of very unique guns. Backtracking becomes a bit tiresome and the ending is anticlimactic, otherwise awesome game. Menus are a bit clunky to use with keyboard and mouse.  Multiplayer is fun, though not entirely polished, only the host has control over the questlog. Great game, worth playing, though its sequel, Borderlands 2, improves on almost every aspect of it."
7196,AWESOME
7197,"I first played Borderlands 2 instead of the first one, I don't remember why. I did go back and play this one after beating the second and I will say that the second is definitely better as far as game play. Story wise, this is a great game and it was a lot of fun throughout, I didn't feel like there was a boring moment throughout it. The pre-sequel I didn't like because it was really repetitive and predictable, but this game does not suffer from that at all, it has all the necessary twists and highlights a good game needs. 

Borderlands is definitely a lot more fun with friends, and this game makes it very easy to invite friends and I never had an issue with it. The way the game is setup, even splitting loot is built into the game so there's no fighting if you're worried about that. Although the game is fun with friends, by no means does that mean that singleplayer isn't geat, I played it the first time solo and second time with a friend on Xbox. Solo is still fun and you'll probably be able to catch the jokes and it'll make it easier to hear the story. Very highly recommend the game, especially if friends are able to play with you."
7198,Borderlands has the best performance I've seen in all my years of gaming because it had started the genre of FPS and RPG.
7199,"Fun game, even better if you play with friends."
7200,"A really, really fun game with high replay value. I like it more than Borderlands 2!"
7201,"I first played this game back in 2009, It consumed many hours per day. I love the artistic style of the entire series, Great boss battle's, and a wide array of weapons to kill with. 9/10"
7202,"Borderlands,Torchlight and Torchlight2 are the action RPG's I have played recently and I enjoy each of them.  Borderlands is a great FPS RPG and it feels like you do not have to do that much grinding, reperating areas for EXP and items unless you feel the need to re-explore an area."
7203,"great Fun game.  Great as a Single player title, even better with friends."
7204,"Diablo meets a FPS. That's really all there is to this. The storyline is okay, and there are some annoyances with travel time across the map. But it's a cool world, keeps you pretty active, and if you at all think a first-person-shooter version of Diablo would be fun, then you will enjoy this game."
7205,"Shoot and loot gameplay.
Lots of fun to be had here.
Plus all D.L.C."
7206,awesome boyyyyyy
7207,it's ok
7208,this is one of the best rpg fps games of all time
7209,"The Underdome will kick your shit in

9/10"
7210,"Amazing game. So much content for its cheap price. 

I envy anyone who has yet to be bitten by the ""gun-collection"" bug. :)"
7211,"Once I bought a retail bundle containing C&C III and Warhammer 40000. The first DVD didn't work at all, while the installation of the latter failed due to some GamesForWindowsLive related problems:

At now, it has been a better deal than Borderlands.

This is the most stupid, annoying, dull, overrated and overpriced (also with the 75% off) game I've ever played. Ah, and no...it's not funny. If you think its humor is enjoyable, you are or stupid or a child (maybe both).
It's always easy; only the arena can be challenging (if you're alone, and you use only sniper rifles and revolvers), simply because they spaw big idiots everywhere around you.

One could say that its real value is about 3 euro, but you can buy the witcher 2 for the same price, and then...no, simply stay away from it; very often, games like Skyrim and Fallout New Vegas go on sale for less money, and offer much more in every aspect."
7212,"I have played much more of the Borderlands series on console a very very long time ago, and from what I can gather, this is a suberb game for those who love to aquire new loot, even more loot and EVEN MORE LOOT! 

Playing the first Borderlands is like opening pass the parcel, the more you play the more you get into it.
The series gets better as it goes on.

For the price of this game crashing down and down and constantly being on sale, 

My rating for this game is a 9/10."
7213,"Loved nearly everything about this game. The art style, the music, the guns (Sooo many guns) the loot system and the locations. The ONE real negative was the ending, which I won't spoil but almost ruined this game for me ( I can understand and even applaud what they did without having to like it). Also the multi-player lags a fair bit if you're not host."
7214,"Playing this after playing Borderlands 2, is like going from Fallout 4 to Fallout 3. It is still an enjoyable game though."
7215,What? Yes.
7216,"Got to be the most boring kill'n'loot game. I try to like it but i just get bored in the first 5 minutes. I rather overdose on something and watch my life go by. Atlas there is borderlands 2, oh wait its the same... well only the pre-sequel is left but after i watched the trailer i said to myself ""Did anyone told them the definiton of insanity?"". But whats this a glimmer of hope i see there? Tales from the borderlands? Not the same but the same like wolf among us and stuff. So i go on a quest to find original games. Its a long path...

Edit: Its k now played some with mah brother"
7217,"I had never even heard of Borderlands before receiving this for my birthday one year but quickly fell in love with it. With it's memorable characters, great storyline and HUGE ammounts of weapons, it's a must have. The price is also pretty cheap now.

Doesn't matter in the slightest that Borderlands: 2 is out, it's still a wonderful game.


10/10 would feed brains to Zombie Baha again"
7218,"A must buy, just get it now please. Same with Borderlands 2, all the Borderlands are cult classics and the style ages well. Both posses an incredible weapons system and seriously if you like shooters get this now."
7219,"good game, would buy"
7220,"Fun.  Think Diablo with guns.

Grab a friend and some ammo and buckle up.  There are tons of quests, cool weapons, and stuff to explore.  I'd recommend sticking to the main storyline and do side quests and such to level or gear up as needed to keep progressing."
7221,Good game
7222,Borderlands is really fun. It is really easy to get a hang of especially if being a beginner. Can play for hours and not even realize it
7223,100% recommended
7224,"It's a FPS Diablo with guns. I'm sold.

In game voice chat could be a bit better (but they get points for trying to incorperate voice chat at all) and there are some odd menu design choices, but overall this game is super fun especially with friends! The art style gives the game it's own look that lets it hold up over time and the charaters and story tidbits are really funny."
7225,"- Set on fire creatures

7226,"Played so much I can shoot bandits in my dreams.

10/10"
7227,Love the Borderlands franchise and own all the games on PC and console. My biggest peeve about this one is no mini map. I'm glad improvements were made for the other games in the series because not having a mini map makes me want to punch a dolphin in the face.
7228,Fantastic game!
7229,"The best loot shooter ive played so far, give it a try you wont be disepointed."
7230,"It's like Beavis and Butthead combined with Mad Max and some RPG elements.

It has its flaws: The item leveling system makes leveling progression difficult in some cases. It is a bit jagged compared to Borderlands 2, but it is still better than the Pre-Sequel. It is also one of the few games where the sequels doesn't outshine the original game to a point where it is pointless to play the original. The only thing which is considerably worse is the quite ugly looking menu, but its functionality still does the job.

It has also some crazy fun moments. I once ""fought"" a complete level, alongside with a boss, entirely made out of cardboards."
7231,"This game officially wins ""The Single Worst Ending In Video Game History Ever"" award.
And don't tell me it's ""meta"" or has a hidden meaning or some sh*t; they clearly ran out of budget and/or ideas.
Completely killed my mood to completing the DLCs or even playing BL2.
Edit: I can't believe I'm writing this; this review is a godd*mn joke."
7232,i love the borderlands franchise i cant get enough if it and i cant wait till borderlands 3 gets announced.
7233,This is a great game. If you have a pc with low specs you have a high chance of running this. My pc was from 2006 and i can run this game on the max settings. The game is realy fun. I would recomend getting it on sale so you can get the first and second borderlands.
7234,"Very good game with a good storyline, very fun game to play. Wrote it for the achievement too :D"
7235,"no just. no.

this game is just pure no

the singleplayer is grindy and slow as fuck it took me about 4 hours to get through the first two areas of the game. I've played games that are shorter then the opening ""starting"" area of this mess. combat is generic and any class besides the Berserker is unplayably weak (they simply dont have enough HP) the single player is unbalanced as fucking fuck 

but perhaps this games bigest sin is the sin of its sequal and pre-sequal. ITS SO SLOW AND BORING THANK GOD I DIDNT SPEND ANY MONEY ON THIS GAME AND GOT IT AS A GIFT"
7236,Great game!
7237,"If you like games that invole a looting system to find better equipment, then this game is for you. The amount of time solely dedicated to grinding up some gun drops to collect or to sell for ingame cash. Running out of inventory space when you can't decide what to through is just half the fun."
7238,"i spent 30 hours beating this game
and i still don't know what it was about"
7239,"This game brought in a lot of old ideas, added some new ones, and threw in co-op. If there is one thing that I love, its co-op. The story line is original but does not play a big part in the actual game. The biggest aspect of this game is the coop and the mass amount of guns. Oh there are so many guns. Add the DLC on top of that with even more guns included, and by the end you have closer friends and an arsenal."
7240,Totally awesom
7241,Good game
7242,"The shoot-n-loot that started it all. This one's grounded in realism and/or Mad Max a little more solidly than its successors, but still one hell of a good time. For the best experience, play through with three friends, one of each class. Not as much can be said for the longevity of this game, which is why the other three (and soon four) exist. But it's one hell of a ride. Think of this one as the training and setup for the next two, then once you get there, throw it all out the window and wing the hell out of it. No matter how you do it, it's a good time."
7243,One of the games that i can actually say no matter how old it is always fun!!!!
7244,"Very fun game! Almost as good as the second one. Almost..
Only bad thing is that after the first time you finish the game it wount be fun anymore to play it. But maybe its just me.."
7245,"Best RPG collection released so far.
BD 2 > BD 1 > BD pré-séquel  (quality meaning)"
7246,"What can I say?  It's Borderlands.

Ok guess I can say more.  Borderlands is a lot of fun.  Especially with friends but even alone is a great game.  It's funny.  The game play is like most rpg.  Ya, there are a lot of fetch quests, but it was not that big of a deturant for me.  Ya, I know it says 30 hours, but I actually own this for my playstation.  Got it on sale here to play with my friend.  

In the end this game is worth getting at full price.  So few games are these days.  Oh and pick up Borderlands 2."
7247,Overall awesome game!  8/8
7248,"Little better than a solid fps game. The story is averige, but the gameplay is good. Lots of guns, less than in borderlands 2 but still lots of it. Graphics is ok, its an aquired taste who like cell shaded games. con for mi is just a little thing: every time u go back in an area where youve been and done some missions, the enemies respan. But after you kill them again you get just 1xp for each of them so gets boring every time to kill the same enemies but not get the credit for that. I mean it demands the same level of skill to kill one enemy each time, but you are creditet for it just once.

7,5/10"
7249,Good old borderlands.
7250,"This game disny work on Win 10. Capped a 62 fps, with frequent stuttering. FOV is locked. Absolutely horrible. Big steaming pile of putrid mess . Thank jesus for refunds."
7251,"This is a great game! ... If you like *endless* shooters and insubstantial plot. I purchased it on sale since all my friends have it (yeah yeah, the whole ""friends jumping off a bridge"" argument, etc. etc.). I figured it was high time to give the classic a try. I must say, I was initially ntrigued with the characters, settings, weapons and creatures. That intrigue grew into disappointment within the +4 hours logged and all I'd done was run around the same areas shooting skags and bandits and collecting loot. All too quickly it became tedious and repetitive, to the point where I had to give up. I'm assuming this is a game better suited to a casual multigamer day with your mates, I guess, if that's your cup of tea, then kudos! Have all the fun with it! But if your a gamer who wants a bit more meat and potatos to your gaming experience, I'd suggest looking elsewhere."
7252,"A great start for a great series. It lacks a lot of what the sequels can offer but underneath that dull exterior hides a lot of fun and good times to be had. Heck in some areas it's even better than the games to come from it, and I definetly belive you should experience them for yourselves.

9/10"
7253,Old school borderlands!
7254,best game ever!!!! ;3
7255,"My advice is personally to skip this, and start with the second. I tried to play this game singleplayer, and i found no fun in it. This might be fun multiplayer though."
7256,"Note: I've sunk dozens of hours into the PS3 version of the game.

While Borderlands 2 has plenty of things to mark it as superior, the original is still an incredibly fun game. There's issues with environment variety and useless upgrades but the experience as a whole more than makes up for it."
7257,"well i have the game like from the same deal last year and ya i know its gonna way to late to say but the game dosnt work for me, it will fire up for like a min and then turn off i dont know why but it does might be my compluter"
7258,"This was a very entertaining game i played through it with a friend we had a great time and i would recommend this game even if you are playing by yourself the main campaign is great and so is the dlc.
The only problems i had with this game is when the file corrupted for my character."
7259,"I don't always post a review.
But when I do, that's because the game is worth it.

[h1]Positive aspects[/h1]
So,
This game is the first of the Borderlands franchise -> the base of it.
It tells the beginning of the story (for fans who enjoy the story) 
Even if it is a FPS game, the RPG dimension fits really Well with it (Characters upgrading, skill three, a lot of loot, etc)

[h1]Negative aspects[/h1]
You are going to edit your games config files to improve the settings (FOV, binds, etc)
Just Google Borderlands PC tweaks and it should be easy.

This game is definitively worth the 20€ I paid.
What ? Summer Sales ?
Why don't you have it already ?"
7260,"Borderlands:

Features 870 Gajillion guns.
27 inventory slots."
7261,I like the game alot! although its difficult at times...
7262,"A great FPS with awesome characters, humor and lots of guns. Well worth the money!"
7263,I really really liked this game. I highly recomend it if you want to have co-op fun with your frends and also like to play alone from time to time!
7264,"SO GOOD

the thing is main mechanics are random kinda

weapon drop rates and stats are randomized
enemy behaviour is random so you theoraticaly cant fight the same guy twice

9.5 out of 10 thats my final rating good job guys

also one more thing Thanks Skeleton With Standards ^_^"
7265,Fun co-op game
7266,"Borderlands is a really fun game. It runs well and as a single-player fps it's really very good. However it's not really story-heavy even though the characters are really well written. 

The only major problem I found with it is that everything about the game, from the movement to the menus, scream Console Port.

7/10"
7267,Great game. Addictive. But repetitive. Lots of weapons. Big world. Enjoyed it.
7268,"I like the gun control in this lands.
After many years, I still play this even I have the sequel and prequel"
7269,I love this game it's great
7270,"This game never bores me.

I first got the game on my Playstation 3 and played it for a very long time untill I sold my Playstation.
A few years later I bought the game back on pc becuase missed the good times I had in Borderlands, playing it again feels like I am playing the game for the first time again.

Definitly a great game that stands out amongst all other shooting games because of it's humor, cool graphics style, replayability and just a whole lot of fun things to do!"
7271,This is an amazing game. I can't even put in words how good it is. Go check it out for yourself
7272,BORDERLANDS!
7273,"I rate 9/11, amazing gaem, would paly again !!1!1"
7274,"Really fun 4 player game. Theme and art style are awesome, and overall just enjoyable."
7275,my favorite borderlands some reviews are negative beacuse dumb asses played the second 1 first
7276,"The original loot n' shooter from Gearbox Software, Borderlands is a game guilty only of spawning vastly superior sequels. While far from a bad game, Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel simply eclipse the original in every single aspect. The environments are mostly just the same desert terrain throughout the entire adventure; the scenarios are nowhere near as memorable; the characters, although still entertaining, are represented much better in the later games, and the gameplay feels more monotonous and slow. I don't really hold this against Borderlands, as it clearly feels like Gearbox was trying to find its niche with this first entry. Again, this game is not incompetently made. It still can be some good fun, especially with some friends. It just happens to be the first game in its series, with the sequels improving every single aspect of the groundwork. I would recommend playing this game, particularly if you've never played a Borderlands game before. But only to be able to understand and appreciate what the original did and all of the improvements that were later brought to the table."
7277,"Think of it as a beautiful blend of Fallout's post-apocalyptic/alien story, Quake's FPS fun, and Diablo's loot, level and mission system.

The story is long enough to be fun to play but not feel never-ending. It is nice, interesting and quite funny.

The side missions can be a bit annoying, since they are focused mostly on harvesting items or kills around huge maps.

The maps can be gigantic if you don't have a car. And trust me, you will lose the car eventually. Somehow, it manages to explode after running over enough enemies.

It is, however, 100 times better than RAGE. And trust me, I am huge id Software fan. But that game is very badly made. It felt like a product that was released at the deadline rather than 100% completion and testing. Borderlands doesn't, even though there are a few bugs here and there, especially with places you can get stuck in or invisible mini-walls you can crash into.

Very funny to play multiplayer, but be sure to turn off the voice streaming if you'll be using Skype (or similar), for it is automatically turned on and you'll be as mad as a cow before you realise where the extra voice is coming from.

Make sure to test all classes for 10 levels so you know which one feels best for you as well as whose unique superpower you like best.

9/10 - definitely would reccommend."
7278,Very fun and addicting game
7279,"I really enjoyed this game. I played through it one time using the soldier. I haven't gone back to try the other classes/characters, yet.

The look of the game is appealing, and the overall feel (tone, story, etc.) is very nice. It has a feel similar to Rage, but with a an actual complete story to follow. The keyboard controls follow the basic FPS setup (WASD+Mouse), which makes the learning curve very easy. The driving element is pretty easy, as well, since you steer simply by looking around with the mouse and use the keyboard for forward, backward, and boost. The story is good enough to drive most of the action in the game (and is picked up and further explained in Borderlands 2). There is a lot of humor written into the plot that fits seemlessly with the graphic feel.

One nice thing about the Game of the Year edition that I bought on Steam: it comes with all the available DLC on Steam. You won't find yourself being further prodded to spend $2 here and $5 there like with Borderlands 2. If you can get this one on sale, and you like post-apocalyptic/sci-fi/western shooters, this could be a great addition to your library."
7280,NO!!!!!!
7281,"Fuck man, i had fun."
7282,It's very fun with friends but if you're alone it gets boring real quick. But if you have some friends and if you hate rakk then this is the game for you.
7283,"I have played through it twice and will likely play through it again. It is not without its flaws, the huge world to explore, wonderful art style, and loot shooter action makes for an addictive game."
7284,You know that feeling of progress when you get better equipment and the older enemies are now eaiser to destroy. It feels great huh. Well this game doesn't have it.
7285,"Borderlands is a good game. I have logged many hours into the console version and i am glad i did. Its a great game if you're going to play with friends or by yourself.

[h1]REVIEW[/h1]
[b]Borderlands[/b] is a chef-d'oeuvre of gaming. It boasts a masterful blend of FPS and RPG elements with an elaborate loot system to make for truly delectable gameplay. Complementing the gameplay is the unique and self-identifying art style and graphics, the blithe and cartoonish atmosphere, and the lighthearted narrative and zany NPC characters. All of these factors working in concert generate one hell of a gaming experience that should be able to bring pleasure to nearly any gamer out there.

The gameplay is designed to offer both the face-paced action of an FPS with the character progression elements and gameworld massiveness of an RPG. There is an XP system that awards level-ups and ability-boosts. There are scores of quests to complete; some ancillary and others pivotal to the core narrative. There is a crazy world to explore, filled with various interesting NPCs. Enemy spawns and combat occur in real-time, right in the midst of everything else that is going on in the gameworld. There is never a dull moment or a lack of something to be working towards.

[b]Borderlands[/b] also has an elaborate and semi-random loot drop system. In the style made popular by games like [i]Diablo[/i], loot spills out of chests, crates, and enemies to pile up on the floor for you to peruse. Much of it will be junk, but you must always keep an eye out for the rare high quality drops. Due to the nature of the stat-progression of the weapons and the sheer variety, you will find yourself experimenting with many more and various weapons than you would in a standard FPS.

Another defining aspect of [b]Borderlands[/b] is the self-identifying art style and graphics scheme. The graphics fit the theme of the game with perfection, as they expertly relay the feeling of zany, cartoonish raucousness that the game is striving to evoke. This atmosphere sets the tone for the burlesquing narrative which never wastes an opportunity to poke fun at the other, more serious games it relates to.  

Finally, one of best aspects of the game is the multiplayer functionality. Also borrowing from the style made popular by games like [i]Diablo[/i], you are able to play with other people by either allowing them to join your session or by joining theirs. You bring your own characters and earn your own XP and loot, but the game will be progressed up to the point that the host has reached. Playing with friends, or even with random people, can make the experience exponentially more hilarious and fun.

If you have yet to give this game a try, then I envy you. It is one of the hallmark games of its generation and will forever live on as a masterpiece of its time. So stop reading this and get on with it!

Addendum: After the Gamespy shutdown, multiplayer functionality has been moved over to Steamworks in 2015, so it continues to work properly.

7290,"Guilty pleasure. Don't get me wrong, the first 20 lvls or so are a greatly satisfying experience, but after that, the stereotype comes rather quickly. Even though the ratings are quite high, I think it is overrated. The gameplay is fueled by MMO-style questing and a complex random stats weapons and loot system. What I liked was the cel-shaded graphics, brilliant music by Jesper Kyd et al. and the addictivity of it all. The game is suitably challenging and entertaining. Being quite long it will take you about 45hrs to get through most of the content of the main game. The DLCs, especially the Zombie one, are well-done, however, the car one has way too long transitions between quests and the arena one is a complete nonsense. There are many bad design decisions throughout the game that will make you wanna rip your hair out. But it isn't insurmountable. The game attempts at being humorous, using memorable characters like Claptrap, Dr Ned, T.K. Baha or Scooter. The overall impression is good though, buy it, a must-have for achievement hunters."
7291,"I've heard this games PC port is pretty bad but this game is a classic. The ending is terrible, the mobs are repetitive and boring after the seconds run through, and the abilities don't hold much weight. All that said, this game is incredible and is still fun now. The downloadable content is fun and definitely adds a much needed extension to the experience, but the arena pack is useless and not really worth it aside the achievements and the level extension.

Personally if you are looking for a Borderlands title I would get BL2, it's just a better game all around.
Only buy this if you can pick it up on sale, or if you want the full experience."
7292,This game really caught me.Great game ye =0
7293,wrost game ever. Freezes randomly. fck stupiud shit game 1
7294,GOTY 10/10
7295,You haven't bought this game yet? Shame
7296,"LET'S GO TO PANDORA TO
GET 1 OF 87 BAZILLINN GUNS
AND HAVE LOT OF FUN
AT THE BORDERLANDS"
7297,By far one of my favourite games ive played with friends
7298,i love this game it is so much fun i recommend to all those who love this kind of game
7299,"This game is simply amazing, 20 hours in and a lot more to go. A full completion this game can go to over 50 hours, definitely worth the price tag. The story is a little weak but the gameplay more than makes up for it. I see a lot of people complaining that this game is not fun solo or at sometimes impossible but that is far from the truth if you are at all familiar with shooters, also knowing the mechaincs of the game will help quite a bit. For example, having a shield that lets out an AoE when fully depleted can be used to run in with your prefered weapon type for some free kills. Make sure to learn your item's passives and use them to your advantage. Learning how to use your second winds right is also key when solo. You will find you will be running low on HP for most of your playthrough. This game is a must play!"
7300,2k shit console port where zoom sensitivity is higher than hipfire sensitivity and input options are retarded
7301,One of the funniest fps games out there
7302,fun
7303,I actually just started the series and I really regret not playing it sooner holy fuck..
7304,Fun game for some time but can get quite boring without someone to play coop with
7305,better gameplay wise than anything but could use better graphix. worth the money
7306,fun to play with friends but could be considered repetitive to some people. A really good shoot and loot to play with friends!
7307,"I guess that since I now have over 340 hours on Borderlands, I ought to write a review for it.  As you can guess, yes, I recommend it.  It's a really good First Person Shooter and plays well even today (2016).  If you're wondering whether you should play this before Bordlerlands 2, I'd say yes.  It's not mandatory.  But, with what happens here, it will make the story in Borderlands 2 even better.  There are some quirks (i.e., small bugs) with the game though.  But, since it's long out of maintenance, we just have to live with them.  Probably the biggest I ran across was in the multiplayer area:  the microphone doesn't work well.  We worked around this by turning the microphone off in the game and using Steam's Friend voice chat instead.

As to whether or not it's a good deal, well, I see that it currently lists for about $20 barebones and about $30 as a GOTY edition.  That's crazy talk.  Wait for a sale or buy a Steam code for it somewhere else.  I picked up a GOTY edition for a bit less than $9.  Of course, given that I've played over 340 hours so far, it really doesn't matter how much it cost:  it was worth it.

BTW:  the last playthrough of just the base game took me about 55 hours."
7308,"This game goes to 11.
Very few games in the last ten year have reached this lvl of perfection.
Well done.
"
7309,FREAKING AWESOME
7310,"When did this game come out? 
Timeless.

100% reccomend

9/10 (cbf with the story sometimes maybe im just not an RPG type person)"
7311,Just buy it
7312,Fun and more fun!
7313,Great game. Much nostalgia
7314,"This is one of the best classic shoot-n-loot games you could own. The leveling and combat is great, and so are the characters and enemies. Although I did not care for the story it didn't matter because the combat and loot made up for it. I would reccomend this game and the whole Borderlands series to anyone looing for a great classic game."
7315,"A great game over all.  It has the right amount of adventure, action, story, and funny parts."
7316,"This game has  Extremely fun, satisfying, and intense gameplay, there are three playthroughs of the same story that get progressively harder. This seems like it would get boring... and it can, but the game has such great re-play value, you don't really care. Probably the only bad part about this game is the graphics. and you should expect that from a game made as long ago as it was. This game is very easy to run on almost any computer made around or after the release of the game."
7317,"This game has aged.

Pros:
-Good enemy design
-Good character design
-Loot drop system
-Great Co-op
-Solid shooting
-Funny Dialogue

Cons
-Bland color palette
-Lack of enemy variety
-Poor Solo play
-Too many fetch quests
-Little challenge
-Forgettable bosses
-Lack of character dialouge and interactions
-Meh Story
-Boring skill trees
-Waste of time DLC

Overall:
    6.7/10

Very good for an old game.

This game has something in the ambience that the other Borderlands games don't have, and I like it. Gameplay is obviously worse than in the other ones but this is still worth the play... and pointless to say that this is a must if you want to experience the whole Borderlands story.

""Nostalgic legend"" in my books.

[b]9/10[/b]"
7320,"Insta bought this game back in the day for console and played an estimated time of 200+ hours.

I think everything had already been said about this game and since i played it before Borderlands 2, I'd like
to address the one issue that Borderlands did so much better in than its follow-up.

And that is definitely the lootpool.
While i couldn't care less about Blue- or even Purplegear in Boderlands 2,
i sometimes found myself drooling over Green- and Whiteequipment.

The reason behind it is that when i find a gun in BL2 i can already tell or estimate the usual min. and max. numbers 
of every stat.
But in this game i often times had to check every gun and every stat because there was a small percentage chance that a gun that was seemingly an ordanary weapon, had one of its stats way over the top and i would love to have this back in the upcoming series.

So i suggest to play this game especially for people who came for the loot factor.

"
7321,"so. many. guns. and loadsa killing aswell, but those guns though."
7322,Was fun but got sidetracked and bored after awhile never picked it backup.
7323,"oh my god i started playing this game when i was 7 or 8 and i have since improoved obn it and it is still today one of my favorite games



THANKS 2K 
THANKS GEARBOX"
7324,Shit
7325,"Loot-enthusiasts, RPG lovers, and FPS warlords welcome to the Borderlands! Borderlands is a great game that can be enjoyed by yourself or with up to three of your friends. This game, along with its great DLC, is a must-own for any gamer and you are truly missing out if you do not own it."
7326,"I remember buying this as pre-order, not knowing a thing about other than the fact it had 1 million different guns in it (the reason why I at first fell in love with Borderlands)

But man! Am I glad that I bought it, with more than 500 hours (previous acc) and tons of replays
The humor, the graphics (yes, it's unique), the guns, the gore - essentially everything I keep on loving about this game

You really need to play this game, if you haven't - or if you've only played Borderlands 2 or Borderlands The Pre Sequel"
7327,"Conclusion (tl;dr):
Borderlands: Game of the Year is worth buying (especialy when +50% discounted).
The vault is a plot twist and it was so bad it made me stop playing the game, haven't touched it in months, maybe I will continue one day... maybe.

Positive:
* Great gameplay
* Get the rocket launcher car then drive over all enemies. (flip right on the car type before spawning)
* Large variety of enemies.
* Many missions

Negative:
* The vault is a total plot twist and you will probably not enjoy it, do side missions instead (unles you want to unlock ""playthrough 2"" to get better loot but also stronger enemies).
* You will only recieve a cash reward for completeing the The Vault, you will not recieve any kind of awesome weapon at all.
* Get's a bit repetitive after a while.
* A few mission reward weapons is ONE time only reawards (untill ""playthrought 2"")."
7328,Great game with phenomenal asthetics!

7330,Love it!
7331,A timeless game that never gets old. Co op campaign is amazing if you have some good gaming friends and cool abilities for each character. 10/10 would beat the boss on my first try
7332,"I skipped school to play this on launch day.  
Best decision ever.

Great hybrid of a game mixing RPG class and damage systems with fps gameplay.  Memorable characters and world with interesting story and side missions.  The difficulty kind of depends on how many side missions you take and how many skags you kill, you can outlevel the world pretty easy.

If you have atleast one friend whos willing to play with you definately pick this up.
10/10"
7333,"OG Borderlands is still a huge hit for me and many others. Originally this game was a test run on Gearbox's end on its Gun Generator, and it does it very effectively. There are SO MANY weapons to use in the battlefield, some better than others, but all able to do the job nicely. What I like about this game than Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel is that your weapons do not become obsolete as fast, and an example would be in Borderlands 2 when I was level 55, the level 50 legendaries that I was using were weaker than the COMMON rarity level 55 guns that were dropping, whereas in Borderlands 1, I used a level 15 legendary to kill the level 30 final boss. The weapons all have slightly different stats (recoil, reload speed, damage) but otherwise look and function the same, something Borderlands 2 and TPS fixed. 

The story in the game is admittedly low compared to its sequels, but is still a high driving function in the game, with tons of sidequests avaliable before, during, and after the main quest is completed, giving this game a high replayability without the DLC alone.

Speaking of DLC, this games DLC is INCREDIBLE. All 4 DLC maps are incredibly fun, lengthy, and add SO MUCH replayability to this game and the extra price for the 4 DLC is great to the point buying the game without it is a waste. While Mad Moxxi's Underdome is different than the other 3, all of them are great.

tl;dr This game has a lot of guns, decently driven story with high replayability, and great DLC.

I'd recommend getting this game even if you didn't play for it during a sale, it truly is worth the experience."
7334,"Most disappointment ending ever.
Otherwise game is good."
7335,Really good experience
7336,"I was never able to get into the Borderlands games. I tried, but they never clicked with me. This certainly is not a bad game and I can see why people are so fond of it but me personally I didn't enjoy it, so based on that I wouldn't be able to recommend it. Read the other reviews. Watch some videos. I didn't like it but maybe it will click with you."
7337,Very good game with awesome DLC
7338,One of the wierdest and most fun fps games ever! Some people call it hat simulator and I can see why there are tons of hats from strange hats to unusual hats this game is all about hats!
7339,"Precursor to the legendary Borderlands 2, the original holds up very well alongside its more popular sibling. The best comparison I can offer if you've played the second but not the first is to expect a little more vanilla as far as gameplay and graphics as well as a number of small issues that were ironed out in the second game. These include some leveling issues with enemies, forgettable boss fights, vehicle problems, useless fall damage, falling through parts of the map to your death, too much money, random bugs, etc... However, all the strong points of the second game are present in the combat, humor, leveling system, and overall aesthetics making the original a great experience. All in all, it's a lot of fun and especially so if have the ability to co-op with someone. A definite recommendation."
7340,Nice game.
7341,"It's just shootin' and lootin' as advertised. Very different from other Borderlands game where you shoot, loot and listen to story stuff happen.

If anything would ruin your Borderlands 1 experience, it'd be claptrap though. Seriously makes me freaking sick."
7342,"My friends won't let me play as the Siren anymore.

10/10"
7343,"Borderlands is a lot of fun for the first 20-40 hours, and then becomes extremely repetitive. HOWEVER, you can go through it quickly if you so choose - I simply choose to do everything (which I understand is my own responsibility)."
7344,"This game is old and Dated.
Its Grandad's type of game he played years ago.
Bring a Friend to play with in this game or you will become very lonely and sad."
7345,"Okay so, I loved this game, as a child, as a teen and now as an adult. 
Been playin this all the damn time and never gets old! 
                                                                  MAIN GAME
-It has its own unique ''Borderlands style'' Graphics (that continue thru the whole series) ((and that also are purely fuckin beautiful to look at)) (((hi resolution looks like a fuckin dream)))
-4 different classes, each wit their own uniqe special skills, good and bad sides, skill trees
-Each class gameplay just feels... different, it just has this ''completely different story'' vibe
-There's just so fuckin much to the story its fuckin amazing, like, the first time I played it, I was like; HOLY FUCKIN SWEET MERRY MOTHER OF JESUS (easily hours on hours of gameplay)
-Marauders, Midgets, the iconic mascot of the game; Psychos, burning psychos, Bruisers, soldiers, mini bosses, huge bosses, fuckin Scythids (I hated those fuckers as a child, they scared the shit out of me), ANCIENT FUCKIN CIV GUARDIANS and yeah, fuckin birds, and more await to kill you! Have fun! Marcus Munitions!
((((ALWAYS APPRECIATE MOXXI))))

-Im not gonna spoil it cuz it fuckin rocks, adds even more fuckin hours of pure fuckin insanity gameplay and yeah, its already in the games price, its worth as hell



                                                        Have fun, Vault Hunters!"
7346,"Games of Borderlands are my all time favorites. It's a well made FPS with lots of options how you want to play. Each class offers a different playstyle, many different guns to choose from and it's really fun to play with friends."
7347,"Borderlands is an immersive FPS/RPG with a unique and humourous universe and great cell-shaded graphics. Even by todays standards, this game still holds its own even though it suffers from a couple frustrating glitches and development issues, which are mostly corrected in the second opus.

Pros:
- Great universe and unique graphics
- Good soundtrack and sound design, especially when played on headphones
- Fun and fast-paced gameplay
- Borderlands' unique kind of wacky humour
- Vast map and good variety of monsters and bosses
- Many sidequests and collectibles
- Multiple DLC's with many additional biomes, enemies, storylines and weapons

Cons:
- Relatively bland storyline. Thankfully the universe makes up for this.
- May seem repetitive over longer periods of time
- Poorly designed map and navigation system, leading to frustration at times
- Several organisation issues when trying to play co-op with friends on Steam
- Snipers have 2.0 optical zoom at best, and glitches occur when shooting very distant enemies anyway
- Good but scarce voice acting, forcing the player to read (or ignore) short texts for all quests in order to understand the storyline
"
7348,"Love the whole post-apocalyptic vibe, full of badassery and lots of random characters"
7349,great original story game with good characters but bad graphics
7350,"(A bit) old but still cool!

The first chapter of Pandora's adventures, in part linked to sequels (Ps: B2 is amazing!). The story itself is simple and crude, but the game is full of humor and for that alone it's worth to get to the end.

[i]""You followed Claptrap into Fyrestone, and soon found yourself in a firefight with the local bandits. If you can find a survivor, maybe he'll be able to help you on your way to finding the Vault.""[/i]

Pro:
- Common leveling system based on earned experience (XP): missions, challenges and killings (lv 1-51 and then up to 69).
- Enemies' level is enough balanced throughout the storyline. Once the story is complete you can start it again (2 times), maintaining your own level and equipment. Even enemies will obviously have a higher level = best rewards.
- Cooperative mode (up to 4 players): If you have nerd but hilarious friends (in this case COD experts are not a good choice) the overall value of the game increases exponentially.
- Graphic Style (if you like the genre).
- Fun, Fun .. FUN!

Cons:
- Almost dead Multiplayer (PvP!?): I think it is better if you call a friend!
- Single player mode is likely to become a bit repetitive at the end (farming is necessary).
- Visual control system for the vehicle (pc = mouse)
- Waste of time (30h for a complete -not speed- run). The Vault in Pandora is waiting for you (but also your girl-/boyfriend!)

DLC:
I think it's worth (in fact it is necessary) to buy them in order to really enjoy the whole story. They are more funny than the game itself. The only exception is the Underdome of Moxxi. The level of enemies to fight in the three arenas will be calibrated according to yours, with the result that some challenges will be very difficult (almost impossible). In my opinion: co-op or nothing.

Conclusion:
If what you want is shoot at crazy pychos (semi-humans) who are running towards you or at other brightly-colored and shocking space monsters (to enjoy seeing them exploding obviously), well, this is the game for you, or rather, the world for you.

Welcome to Pandora!

Considering the release date (2009):

Single: 8/10
Co-op: 9/10


Ps: I've found this in the web: here you can find eveything you need (classes, mission flow, tips, things to read while you're on the toilet): http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Borderlands"
7351,"I did very much enjoy this game but it isnt without fault. I have 19 hours in the game, with that I have completed the game and every single (maybe bar 1 or 2 that ive missed) side missions. In honest the game isnt very long, it does come with a new game + feature for those that want to give it another go with a harder difficulty, but for me I dont think I could do 2 times around. 

What I will say is that it was great fun, it was a diffirent type of shooter, both in gun types and personal character skills, it is definately a game worth playing through, I only wish it was MORE DIFFICULT. If you do all the side missions you level up so fast and get so much gear that the game is effectively easy, you could beat the game with under 5 deaths if you be careful, its fun but its easy, if you find 3 mates to come then enemies are 4x strength, might be nicer to play, im not sure."
7352,"This game brought in a lot of old ideas, added a few new ones with fastpaced action/game play.  The story line is original but does not play a big part in the actual game. The co-op is a big part in Borderlands with maximum of four difrent characters and four players, It has many many guns, character modifiers, etc... The gamplay is polished fluent, you get in quickly, the audio is making the perfect atmosphere, the uniqe graphics are well made a bit cartoonish. 

 The DLC-s are fun buy them if you can (i didnt like Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot, even with a few friends it can get super boring fast and its not worths of its full price!)

TLDR:

If its on sale buy it! This game is a very fun shooter, but with flaws."
7353,The first and still the best game in the series. Shotgun revolvers. I rest my case.
7354,I like borderlands because its just a free world and the bosses have funny names like nine toes (who also has 3 balls) its also fun to play with a friend.
7355,Good game to play with a few friends
7356,"My wife and I played this on LAN for two playthroughs, I was offline during that time, so the hours didn't log. I have approx 120hrs in the game. We did it all 2.5 playthroughs and we finally put it down after failing Crawmerax several dozen times. Good game, they didn't quite nail the colors in this one like they did in BL2.

The DLC is what made this fun. The main game is good, but was so brown that I lost interest.

My take away: This was my wife's first Co-op gaming experience, and first FPS. It was a perfect platform for learning, we had a lot of fun."
7357,Dope Ass Game
7358,"Fun gameplay, loot craziness, crude humor, Love it!"
7359,Glad I found this older title!
7360,It's like Fallout but instead of trying to get out of the vault you are trying to get in.

7362,GOAT.
7363,"Terrible, boring and repetative. Dissapointing end battle. Decent graphics at least but everything else sucks."
7364,"Borderlands was a revolutionary game when it came out. I remember hearing that \""ain\'t no rest for the wicked\"" song in the intro and thinking that this was the coolest game sice gta san andreas. Nowadays it\'s a bit dated, but it can still be a worthwhile eperience for new and returning players."
7365,Couldn't get to play it. System keeps crashing
7366,"Games got guns, guns and more guns, Zombies!!, clap-traps and midgets, but even that cant make it fun for long.
The game just got boring real quick not as fun as borderlands 2.
The dlc has no quick travel so lots of running around or driving(knoxx dlc) sooo much driving, and that grueling mad moxxi underdome dlc.
co-op seems dead, rarely had anyone join my game or seen a open room on the list for me to join.
so if uve played borderlands 2 just skip this game."
7367,Lol just writing a review to say my first experience meeting the midget psychos was pretty funny.
7368,"A perfect combination of a RPG, loot farmer, and FPS."
7369,"Only a couple hours in at the tie of writing but the game is really fun. Servers seem to be dead though so no online co-op unfortunately but the single player is definitely solid enough to merit a purchase on it's own. The gun play is great as well and like all RPG's you'll spend a lot of time picking stuff off the ground, raiding cupboards, lockers etc and just exploring. Definitely worth a shot (Get it? Cause there are guns? Ok)"
7370,"I can easily say this is by a clean landslide the most fun I've ever had playing a video game. While there are a few games I would pup above this one objectively, this is simply the most fun one. I've beaten it about 7 or 8 times now, and I'm already starting my next playthrough. Absolutely worth it! 100%"
7371,"Very good game, nice art style. Although the game is poorly balanced."
7372,"This game imo was fun to play with friends and i liked it. I would recommend it but I would rather wait for a sale and get Borderlands 2. But from my experience I need to rate this game a 8/10

Explenation: 
It's very fun with friends and It has a good storyline but the game gets boring too fast."
7373,If you Buy it and Finish it with A friend It's gonna be Awsome... but doing it Solo IS not So Fun.... But it's A Great Game Anyway!
7374,One of my all time favorites. Something for everyone.
7375,if you like to shoot shit and have a sense of humour this game is for you
7376,"The original Borderlands, while it might not have as shiny a package as its descendents, it's still a fantastic game. It set the bar only to be exceeded by Borderlands 2. Really, this game series is one of the finest I've ever laid hands on. The hours, days, weeks, months, years of entertainment these games have brought me have bore me no regret.

The story in this game sets up the second story, which leads into the pre-sequel's story. This game's also great to run back to although nowhere near as much as Borderlands 2."
7377,[h1] 8/10 TJBs [/h1]
7378,The best CO-OP game I've ever played
7379,"Borderlands is a great game! I love the variety of weapons in the game (rocket launcher is my favorite), and the enemies are all pretty diverse. It's a very different experience from most games I'm used to, but it was definitely worth the money. The graphics are weird and take some getting used to, but the game in general is very enjoyable. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, which makes it more fun. One thing to note is that this game is much more difficult without friends. Co-op (with up to 4 players) makes the game EXPONENTIALLY easier."
7380,This game is by far one of the best games that i own. I plan on completely going through every single experience that is humanly possible in this game. By the time that i am done with this game I will have beaten it a couple times.
7381,GG
7382,Great looking game but its too bad I cannot figure out where the hell to go or what my missions consist of.Its got a nice soundtrack and very nice visuals thats about all it has going for it.Storyline is very linear.
7383,"What's a Mexican's favourite game? 





Borderlands"
7384,"This is a must have game and when Borderlands 2 comes out I am going to beat off soooo hard to it. The cell shaded graphics are awesome, it has great sound and some of the best music of any game I've ever played, it is violent, and it is just an absolute blast. It is a ton of fun to play online with friends also. If you get this game get this GOTY edition because all four DLC's are pretty good."
7385,"★★★★☆
You need this game in your library ... that is all ... nah nah let's motivate a bit, this is one of the best 4 person co-op experiences you will ever play, the RPG elements mixed with the wonderful world of Pandora, the first person shooting and the unique weapons along with the item drop system similar to that of Dungeon Crawler games this makes it a MUST OWN and MUST PLAY title, get this game now ! NOW !!! Before you play any of the other Borderlands titles ! 4/5!!!"

7388,"Don't let others tell you how great a game is. Get the game and experience it. Once you finish Borderlands, you'll want to go straight into Borderlands 2, of course once you finish the playthrough 2, 2.5, and get more loot, and maybe the DLC.

Is too addictive. Buy it!"
7389,"The game that started it all.  It is simple, fun, and fairly funny, and the story is pretty good.  The ending is anti-climatic but it sets the stage for the second one.  Get this and finish it than play the second one.  8/10"
7390,"*Will update this as i play more*

-First 4 Hours-
After the firest 4 hours i am very happy with this game and it is exactly what i hoped it would be. i have defeated 1 or 2 bosses and despatched them with ez. I am scared that the game is gonna get alot more difficult but am looking forward to the hours of fun i am sure to have."
7391,"I'm sitting here trying to think what to write but in all honesty just get the game it's great, hey, do you like shooting? well of course you do, do you like crazy ass mofos on top of cars shootin? get it"
7392,"This has always been a favorite of mine. I love the story and art style, the humor in it is perfect. Highly recommend the DLC."
7393,"Although offering considerably lesser amounts of content than its successor Borderlands 2, and having a couple of both technical and design flaws, Borderlands 1 still offers a great amount of content for a fair price. The best way of playing this game is with a full 4-man-squad - it does get kinda repetitive after a while when playing alone. My personal rating: 7.5/10, rising to 8.5 when playing in CoOp. Everyone who was too young for it when it first was released in 2009: Check it out! It's a classic."
7394,"I held off buying for a long time. The weird cell-shaded animation aesthetic rubbed me up the wrong way. I'm glad I was proven wrong. 

Differently levelled areas means you don't get bored."
7395,"this game has to be the most copied game from borderlands 2. io woul;dnt not recommended this game. too similar from its previous game borderlands 2. also the color looks like minecraft also sub to slammacow and yogscast!!

i would not recmnd this game."
7396,"As opposed to borderlands 2, here theres no memes or childish jokes, humor is unobtrusive and is not annoying after playing many times, characters actually feel cool and dont try to shove their originality up your throat. Some levels can be monotonous with desert and badlands and rust and trash coast but i view it as non-intrusive and chill. There is no need to farm bosses for hours because good equipment can be bought in shops if you have enough money. 
Playing revolver mordecai and trying to go only for headshots, while moving yourself, is very good aiming practice. Unfortunately to get crisp gameplay a person must use external sites and dig in the config files to remove smooth framerate, mouse smoothing, oneFrameThreadLag and set their sensitivity/Fov bind (Borderlands2 fixed SOME of those but i wasnt able to change configs in bl2 to fix the rest)"
7397,i played the 2 borderlands game but when i first played the 1st 1 i see how they improved the game beliee me if yu just got into the serieris play this 1 first
7398,"very great game and totally worth i

7401,"Lock, Load, & Face the Madness 
Get ready for the mind blowing insanity! Play as one of four trigger-happy mercenaries and take out everything that stands in your way! 
With its addictive action, frantic first-person shooter combat, massive arsenal of weaponry, RPG elements and four-player co-op*, Borderlands is a breakthrough experience that challenges all the conventions of modern shooters. Borderlands places you in the role of a mercenary on the lawless and desolate planet of Pandora, hell-bent on finding a legendary stockpile of powerful alien technology known as The Vault. 
Role Playing Shooter (RPS) - Combines frantic first-person shooting action with accessible role-playing character progression 
Co-Op Frenzy - Fly solo in single player or drop in and out with up to 4 Player Co-Op online for a maniacal multiplayer experience 
Bazillions of Guns - Gun lust fulfilled with rocket-launching shotguns, enemy-torching revolvers, SMGs that fire lightning rounds, and tons more 
Radical Art Style - New visual style combines traditional rendering techniques with hand-drawn textures to create a unique and eye-catching spin on the First Person genre 
Intense Vehicular Combat - Get behind the wheel and engage in intense vehicle-to-vehicle combat

And the game returned after six years when gamespy shutdown.I recommended everyone to buy this game and help the developers because this game has 7 cool things:
1.cool graphics
2.cool gameplay (don't buy dlcs and wait for the sales)
3.cool story
4.cool tons of weapons from common to legendary,and cool element effects
5.steam has fix the coop mode,you can play up to 4 players include 4 cool classes (Soldier,Hunter,Lilith,Brick) with awesome skills
6.cool bosses fight
7.cool NPC and detailed maps.

7406,"I bought Borderlands for Xbox 360 back when it came out in 2009 and had so much fun playing co-op with my friends. Borderlands for PC is even better, looks great, plays great, servers are fine. If you want some multiplayer fun with your friends, this game is amazing. Can't really recommend for just solo play though. It has Diablo-esque RPG/loot elements but I think this game is definitely best enjoyed with a friend or three. Still a great addition to any Steam library."
7407,"Let me make this a very simple and fast review
{also i havent played much of this game on pc but ive beaten it twice on xbox}

Pros-
Great cel shaded graphics
funny characters and enemies
great atmosphere and land layout
easy to learn controls
semi-easy to level up (compared to other rps')

Cons-
Terrible FOV its super annoying that the gun is right up your nose

Overall 
if its on sale buy it right  away but if its not and you are like me and you dont like bad FOV install a mod to fix the fov 
Anyways still buy it its really good

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The gameplay of borderlands consists of doing quests and killing enemies. The gameplay quickly gets boring and repetitive, and to keep it fresh the game is always introducing new enemy types, new locations and new loot.

There are vehicles to help you get across faster.

[b]The playable characters[/b]
[list]
	[*]Mordecai, Hunter Class, [spoiler]focus on sniper rifles and revolvers[/spoiler] 
	[*]Lilith, Siren Class, [spoiler]focus on SMGs and elemental damage[/spoiler] 
	[*]Brick, Berserker Class, [spoiler]focus on rocket launcher and explosives[/spoiler] 
	[*]Roland, Soldier Class, [spoiler]focus on combat rifles and shotguns[/spoiler] 
[/list]

[b]Weapon Types[/b]
[list]
    [*]Eridian Weapons
    [*]Combat Rifles
    [*]Repeater Pistols
	[*]Revolvers
    [*]Rocket Launchers
    [*]Shotguns
	[*]Sniper Rifles
	[*]Submachine Guns
[/list]


[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics hold really great even today. The cel-shaded visuals never get old, and some of the landscapes are gorgeous. Everything from locations to characters and enemies, are extremely stylized and everything fits great together.

About performance, I never had any problems with this game. Runs flawlessly.


[h1]Replay Value[/h1]
Borderlands has 4 playable characters, and all of them have their own skill trees and focus on specific weapon types, each with the level cap of 69.
There is over 17,000,000 possible weapons.
And, not only that, but the game features a game+.
So it definitely has an amazing replay value, if you don't get tired of it.


[h1]Story[/h1]
The story of borderlands is simply about (4) vault hunters searching for a [spoiler]fabled[/spoiler] vault.


[h1]My Opinion[/h1]
I ended up beating this game twice with each character in the xbox360, mostly in single player but I still had fun. I totally recommend this game, even if you don't have friends!"
7417,If you love the Diablo series. And also enjoy first person shooters. Borderlands is the type of game you'll enjoy
7418,"After having owned this game for about six years, I finally got around to playing it in its entirety.  It's a great take from the early stages of the RPG/FPS hybrids that are outrageously popular these days.  The gameplay is a blast and stands up to the test of time and the randomly generated loot is always exciting to pick up.  One gun could be entirely different from the next even if they're of the same category and you never know what kind of crazy weapon you'll be adding to your arsenal next.

My only real complaints are that long range sniping could be improved and that by the time of the final DLC, if you're playing through all of them consecutively, the game starts to drag a bit.  Sniping seems to snap to a grid for particularly long ranged shots without a great scope which is unfortunate for those of us who have a sniper rifle preference.  The DLC is fun, though it's mostly more of the same.  There are new enemy types but the quest format is unchanged and they often feel like very well done skin swaps.

All in all, I highly recommend the game if you have a friend or three to play with and consider it a worthy purchase even if you don't.

Just make sure to have your volume control nearby for when Claptrap decides that he wants to start talking."
7419,"The Borderlands series is very fun, classical game and due to it's 4 player CO-OP. Very adjustable and easy going with friends, who you associate with daily or commonly. Borderlands 1 is a considered old by now, but is still a great game if you've played Borderlands 2 or 3. Has a great storyline and mechanics and very diverse to other FPS type games."
7420,The Begining of something great! What a ride this was!
7421,Great game but environments are all one color.
7422,"Fun shooting and looting, always rewarding to find better weapons and improve your character. Too easy sometimes if you do too many side quests, too hard other times if you don't. Probably a lot more enjoyable if played in co-op mode.
The driving is cool only the first couple of tries, then is simply anoying and even frustrating. Also gets way too repetitive towards the end. Just walk around, shoot and loot."
7423,"If you're coming here from the new Borderlands games and play them only for the gameplay, I would recommend skipping out on this one. If you are only going to buy one Borderlands game, I would recommend Borderlands 2.

That being said, I have enjoyed this game a lot. It's very fun to play through co-op, though I can't vouch for singleplayer as I have never actually played much solo. The story isn't bad at all, just isn't riveting either, but the gameplay kept me coming back. The game really starts to come into it's own in the DLC. The characters are a lot more fleshed out, the graphics are more appealing and the stories pulled me in more.

I will give a few warnings though. The gameplay can be a bit janky, and class skills a bit imbalanced. Some classes are simply less powerful than others. The graphics are a bit dull and grey, though some people are fine with that I'm sure. Overall though I'd say it's a positive experience.

If you can grab this game for cheap or in a bundle, I would recommend doing so."
7424,sex me up buttercup
7425,Shooting crazy stupid people with with a variety of weapons makes me giggle in a disturbing manner.
7426,"""Speaking on the base game, it's gripping.""

Borderlands immerses you in the alien world of Pandora, where intergalactic legends that tell of a ""Vault"" have spurred colonization efforts with the promise of fame, power, and riches to whoever finds and opens it. A time of grand exploration, expansion, and civility...

... This is not that time.

Welcome to Pandora! A dilapidated, dangerous, criminal-infested outcropping of the galaxy, and you decided to go there in search of a Vault that even the best minds of the known universe haven't been able to find in the entire time of this forsaken planet's colonization. Congratulations, you just earned yourself the madman's title ""Vault Hunter"".

I love the universe of this game, it explores what would happen to a world with superficial promise that is ultimately deemed a failure. Withdrawing any solid policing force and left to the ruin of the inhabitants, Pandora goes from, as originally advertised, shimmering haven to, now more accurate, broken dystopia. The lore is firm and is one of my favorite things about Borderlands.

In gameplay, the game works. To sum it up, it's a FPS with RPG elements and an award-winning formula embodied in the loot mechanic. You can easily pick up the game with sprinting, crouching, meleeing, grenade throwing and gun handling near-identical to most modern shooters, and does a good job at all of it. RPG elements are taken into account as you level up, granting you access to different character-specific powers and allowing you to wield more potent weaponry. Areas are typically level-centered so if you are sufficiently leveled previous areas will be a lot easier, but the opposite is true in that if you are not sufficiently leveled future areas are tons more difficult. You can offset the difficulty of future areas by grinding in current areas, largely around being a completionist of quests in your area, I found that this made the game less stressful (and less costly on your ingame currency).

One of the biggest selling points of the game is its loot system, basically enemies have a chance of dropping weapons, energy shields, and grenade mods that you can equip onto your character so long as you meet the equipment's level requirement. Equipment chests are also scattered throughout Borderlands and can host not only the previously listed items, but also class mods which give unique bonuses to your character. It is fun going around questing and finding a chest and having the giddy anticipation of what might be in the box, hoping for some rare OP item that can help you mow down the hordes of bandits and psychos care-free... with your hopes quickly crushed under the abysmal quality of the things you find. When you do find that one awesome weapon though, it can be hard to contain your glee. I have found from my experience that the game is fair and will give you something you're looking for at intervals.

Now for the things I don't really like about the game, all you ever fight are bandits, psychos, skags, bugs, whatever Rakk are, the occasional freak of nature, and varients of them all and that's it. Their AI is simple, predictable, and occasionally bugged. There are fetch quests but they are a necessary evil to help with the pacing of the game. There are inconsistencies on what you will and will not survive. Finally, map design that can be too big and confusing and can get curious adventurers stuck or even killed.

In conclusion, the story and gameplay are good, the pacing is well done and really feels that you are gradually building and building up to something big and making something of youself in the barren wastelands. I like how you eventually are recognized as a planetary threat and there's a lot of crap that happens with that. Overall, I would recommend this game for people wanting the feel of a rugged space frontier complete with guns and energy shields, and even a little magic to boot!"
7427,"Out of the 3 original Borderlands games I have, this would be the second best in my opinion. I originally played this on console and picked it back up on PC and man I am glad I did!"
7428,love this game so much fun to play solo or coop
7429,"love this games thanks steam
"
7430,"I played about half of this game back on the Xbox 360 with a friend, but never finished it, so I decided to re-do everything on the PC instead.  Let me start off by saying, the game is not new, so the controls are a bit stiff sometimes, and the driving mechanics are ATROCIOUS, and there are plenty of bugs or problems you might encounter in the game.

In-between all that, there's the story and the fun.  The actual story, by itself, of this game is really not that good.  It's pretty standard alien race invaders kind of thing.  What actually makes this game unique is the amount of uncensored humor in the story and characters, as well as the graphics style the developers chose.  The art style is reminiscent of comic books or something along those lines, and it does it very well.

Though the story itself doesn't have much value, the humor, graphics, weapon system, and how much fun it is when playing with other people really bring the game to life.  I cannot recommend this game if you do not plan to play it with someone else, as solo play in this game is really pretty boring, but with another person or more, it can be a blast."
7431,"Best of the Borderlands game in my opinion, can't beat the first one. I have played through them all and can say this is the only one i have beat mutiple mutiple times."
7432,An amazing game you just need to play
7433,"First in the series.... An excellent start for it! It has everything you would expect! Its funny, Fast paced and action filled, Dont forget about all the comedy, I recommend trying this if you have not."
7434,"Man, WHAT A GAME! Forget about all the other shooting-and-loot games you've played so far: this is as good as it gets. Violent, extremely funny (some DLCs are hilarious) and with a story that will always keep you moving forward, the game has great characters, great music, awesome visuals and, what's best: the weapons you get come randomly, so you never know...! Play with your friends, and the enemies will get tougher. Also, it's fun to try on new characters every now and then."

10/10 Would kill those weird spider things again!"
7439,"The very first borderlands is not ""the worst borderlands game."" It is the original story, the start, the best damn game ever! I have been playng this and the other games for years apon years. I recommend it to anyone who is confused about the story from the other games or just wants another awesome game in their library."
7440,"Probably the best of the Borderlands games. The games mechanics and physics whilst not perfect are good enough to see this title offer up an enjoyable gaming experience. 

Better still its a reasonably long game and if you buy the game of the year edition theres  value to be had from playing some of the add-ons. 

Definitely worth you time."
7441,"This game franchise is one of my favorites. The action is face paced and it's fun to constantly find new guns to incorporate into your arsenal. The story remains pretty engaging, up until the end when it sort of lost me, but that's no big deal in comparison to the hours of enjoyment I got out of this game. Gearbox really knows how to incorporate some well done humor into the game, which for me made the characters all the more interesting and worth paying attention to as opposed to other games where I often find myself skipping through most of the dialog. One of my main complaints is it can feel a bit repetitive at times. Despite this, I still get a lot of pleasure of running skags over in the Outrunner. This is definitely a game I would recommend."
7442,.
7443,"I only played single player.

- Decent shooter with some fun combat abilities.
- The main storyline is OK but definitely lacks depth and storytelling ability. 
- Lack of voice acting means you have to read most quest intel which makes the story and characters far less engaging.
- The game promotes itself as having ""bazillions"" of guns when actually they are just the same models but with different stats and colour schemes. 

I bought this game and it's sequel really cheap so I thought it was worth it for my £6.
"
7444,"I think Borderlands 2 is slightly better as it offers more enemies, more places, longer campaigns and other fun things. That being said I really enjoy this one too. Its a lot harder then BL2 and this one gives you more loot with much higher chances of getting better items. One night I opened 3 different white chests and found 3 different lengenadries! Playing this again years later after many BL2 playthroughs I have picked up on more little lore bits which I enjoyed. Also, this game really personifies the characters and world a bit better. Borderlands 1 is still a classic done right. I would highly recomend this to people that wanna good casual shoot and loot!

5/5 of course!"
7445,"Another one off the backlog and I have to admit that it isn't good, it isn't bad... It's a little aggression sink to be played in waves."
7446,"Good game, bit short to my taste, but balanced experience!"
7447,This game is a gun control advocate's worst nightmare.
7448,"What isn't there to love? DLC is a must of course, but other tha`n that, replayability and hours of fun are definitely yours to have."
7449,"I have 40 hours in this game. I recommend it if you like the rpg'ish tipe of shooters, it is fun and enjoyable. I would rate it 7.5/10. You go and try it out!"
7450,"I'm late to the 'Borderlands' party -- sure, it's 2016 and I'm only now getting down with Pandora, sue me if you must.

That said, this game is freakin' bonkers.
The first 30 minutes of it I was certain I wasnt going to last simply because the camera angle being locked in place was driving me up a wall.
Once I managed to get past that hurdle it's been relativily smooth sailing.

Although, I do regularly want to murder a certain ClapTrap unit after hearing him tell me to ""comon, check me out, I'm dancing!"" for the umpteenth time.

I'm a Strategy/RPG fan who dabbles with shooters because I'm traditionally not great at them -- but Borderlands f'ing rocks.

My fellow gamers are not sticklers for following story-line like I am, so while they all jumped straight into BL2 without ever playing the first one, and expected me to do the same, I said ""Nah, I need to play the first before I jump into 2 with y'all.""
Good thing too, because by the time I'm done milking the absolute crap out of this title, they'll have moved on to something entirely different so I dont have to play with those goons.

Talk about a WIN WIN!"

-you need a good regular weapon for Crawmerax
-a good poison weapon for purple crab
-a good fire weapon for green crab
-a good lightning weapon for shrimp

Crawmerax vs Siren:
-a full phasewalk Siren with a good catalyst mod (preferably +2 find rare, so better weapon drop)

-basically what you do is shoot as much as u can at his critical point
-hide behind the multiple pillars where no mobs can see you to take little break
-If you start bleeding to death, you switch for the appropriate weapon and kill the nearest ennemy.

7453,"I used to always abstain from shooters as much as I could, since the only ones I had played were Carl of Doody and a few others that hijacked the genre and suffered from severe [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOHyD49DaeA]MMS[/url]. Being a lover of all things RPG, I thought I'd give this a try. And I'm glad I did.

Borderlands has opened me up to a new mindset regarding First Person Shooters and the RPG elements to the game have me hooked. I bought the GOTY edition of Borderlands bundled with the standard edition of the second on sale for $9.99 total and I have to say without a doubt that it's been one of the best purchases I've made on Steam.

I've currently finished Playthrough 1 as Lilith and intend to complete Playthrough 2 as well as start a new game with Mordecai (time permitting, these days).

In my entire experience playing this game, I have not run into any bugs or glitches of any kind. The gameplay has been phenomenal even though most of the quests are fetch quests, but the gameplay itself more than makes up for that. A while back, my sub-par gaming laptop shit the bed so I've been stuck with another laptop that wasn't intended for gaming. That said, Borderlands is still perfectly playable on it with max settings (sans Ambient Occlusion and Dynamic Shadows).

I've also started a bit on the second game as well and I have to say I'll definitely be following Gearbox for updates on their next titles. lol

TL;DR:
Story: 10/10.
Gameplay: 9/10.
Multiplayer: 9/10.
Visuals: 8/10.
Microtransactions=False.

Overall: 9.0/10."
7454,Borderlands! Cause Reasons!

Go buy Borderlands 2"
7458,"Amazing game, thouroughly enjoyed...again. Roll on bl3."
7459,"played it on console but got carried straight to the end had decent gear etc but never got to experience the game for what its good at, playing alone or with someone who isnt to far ahead/behind is a must.
"
7460,"Personally I find this the better of the borderlands games. Excellent gunplay, fun guns, nice plot and characters and generally fun enemy and level design. Though the game seems hell-bent on you playing with other people, it's possible to do everything alone with a few ""tweaks"", so there's nothing to worry about there. 

I would not reccomend getting Mad Moxxi's DLC unless you have freinds, and I would not reccomend attempting the Claptrap DLC until after a second playthrough - the same goes for Crawermax. Overall, completing the game will prove to be a colossal pain in the ass alone, but with a companion it should prove simple enough - if a little tedious.

The game only outstayed it's welcome in some of the DLC sections (looking at you Brain and Claptrap part quests), and the game was keen on highliting it's weaknesses in the more grindy and swarm-like sections of the game, where the game does not excel.

If you don't mind the occasional frustrating horde and you don't mind an annoying levelling system that basically forces you to play the whole game twice, you'll probably have a fair bit of fun. You'll definately enjoy the game with a freind."
7461,"Borderlands is a scifi-first person shooter with a great(almost enternal) leveling system. While the gameplay is great, what I love about this game is its co-operative play. You can play on an open network or on a closed network like a LAN. Players can join and exit a game seamlessly, and campaign progress syncs with other players easily. I played this game with my brothers and we had such a great time playing it. I honestly recommend this game to any of those whom love co-op, first person shooters and great henanigans."
7462,"OH GOD NO! A DIFFERING OPINION! Downvote accordingly at your discretion.

No matter how many times I've tried to play Borderlands I just never saw what other people seem to see in it. Fun with friends? I suppose. But any group of good friends can make the worst game fun. Not that this is the worst game, it's just not good in my opinion. The game just felt bland, sure there's some good stuff here and there like the writing and characters, but the overall game just feels meh.

While the randomized weapon system is a plus for most people, for me it just made no weapons feel special. Hold on I know I phrased that oddly, hear me out. Basically would you rather have a boss that you defeated drop ""Randomized Sniper #127273884"" Or something named like, I dunno ""Long Distance Relationship"" with a measurable usefulness. I just think that a weapon system similar to Dungeon Defenders would have been nice in this game, where you can get named weapons after completing missions or challenges that scale depending on your difficulty. This isn't my only gripe of course, but I just don't care enough to write about everything I dislike about this game, because it's likely next to no one will read this, or care for that matter.

I don't know, you could spend hours explaining why this game is a masterpiece, and I'll understand everything you say, but in the end this game just doesn't click with me."
7463,"Fun game based around fetch quests, gun combat, and grinding/leveling. However, the game would have benefited from the addition of interactive NPCs, varied missions, and less RNG. I did have a few minor annoyances (and one major one). It annoyed me how enemies often only spawned when triggered by your arrival on site (as this nerfed the effectiveness of my character/build -sniper/hunter). Another minor annoyance was how enemies would infinitely respawn (often only minutes after clearing a site). 

However, what really bothered me was how your weapons were always under powered. All enemies were bullet-sponges and a head shot will rarely be enough to take down anyone. So you are forced to run fast or boringly grind until you can do one-shot headers again.

But in the end it was a fun game with great weapon variety. If you enjoy heavy gun/shooting above very light RPG elements this is your game."
7464,"This is one of the most addictive games I've played. The first couple of hours, I was thinking ""Wow, this game really doesn't have much plot."" After that, though, I was thinking ""Wow, this game really doesn't have much plot, and I don't care.""

It's a great shooter. It's a great RPG. The ""87  Bazillion Guns"" promised in the trailer are fantastic. I love the variety. A big part of what makes you want to keep playing is the desire to see what kind of weapon you find next.

The ending was... an ending. Not much more to say there.

Bottom Line: If you're only into really story-rich games, maybe this isn't for you. Everyone else should play it.

EDIT: I've now played the DLCs, and I don't love them.

The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned features irritating undead enemies, including birds (so grab your shotgun), but I did like the ambience.

Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot seems to be all about arena combat. I didn't play that one for long, because that's not really my thing, but it was well done for what it is. 

I HATED The Secret Armory of General Knoxx because it covers an enormous area, and no matter what progress you've made previously, you always start at the beginning location. Don't get this one unless you intend to play it in one sitting.

Claptrap's New Robot Revolution is the best of the four. If you're just going to get one, get this one."
7465,Great gameplay. FPS + RPG elements provide for a very fun game.
7466,"Honestly, I wish there was more. Borderlands is probably the best game series out there, with so much to do it will leave you with a sense of progression lasting over hundreds of hours. Id reccomend this game to everyone, 9/10."
7467,A real rooty tooty shoot n looty.
7468,Good Game :D Nice Story.
7469,"Simple, fun, quite long, shooter. The gunplay is great, story is simple but rewarding. Best played with friends but playing it solo does not lessen the fun"
7470,"Having done 16 complete playthroughs on console of the first Borderlands, I bought the retail GOTY version. Was able to convert it to a Steam copy.

I have only done 3 playthroughs of Borderlands 2 and there's a reason I stopped at 3. Many poor design choices were made in Borderlands 2. It's still a great game, but there were too many issues.

The first Borderlands is by quite a large margin the superior installment of the Borderlands in my opinion. The game hasn't aged too badly, yet it is far less buggy than Borderlands 2.

A lot of Borderlands 2 felt too ambitious and got a lot wrong. Borderlands 1 is far more simple and gets everything pretty much on point first try. There are a few bugs that crop up every so often, but they are all fixed by doing a simple Melee attack.

Biggest issue with Borderlands 2 is the damage scaling is awful. Your weapons get out-dated every 4 or 5 levels. You know that gun that was amazing at Level 13? When you hit Level 18 it's now an absolutely garbage weapon.

Borderlands 1's damage scaling is a lot flatter. Your weapons can be usable for 15-20 levels above their ""Level Requirement"". I had a Level 13 shotgun that was still useable and effective at Level 35.

Weapon proficiency and the In-Game Challenge system in Borderlands 1 were a superior system compared to the ""Badass Rank"" system in Borderlands 2.

Borderlands 1 >>>>>>>>>>>> Borderlands 2"
7471,"I was playing this game with my friend. He was playing Mordecai and I was playing Lilith. While playing I found a shotgun with a scope that rivals many sniper rifles. Jokingly I said ""Hey, watch me snipe that guy on the bridge"" and the bridge itself was far away. So I aim my gun through the scope and fire. It was a goddamn headshot. The moral of the story is that shotguns with scopes can be lethal at long range.

Borderlands is a great game especially with friends and I highly recommend getting the GotY edition because the game is much more enjoyable with all the DLC."
7472,Pure heroin. Steer clear unless you want to have a life.
7473,"Excellent overall theme and charachter development that really draws you into the game and makes the worl come to life.
the devs did an excellent job peicing together the perfect blend of insanity, desperation, and humor. the overall fell of the game as well as the story progression is fairly involved and interesting and it features an almost limitless quest cycle that allows you to bypass the story if youd rather freeplay or roam. the weapons drops and combinations are almost as limitless asthe quests though certian missions solo can be a pain as the diffoculty is insane before you get a few good drops or get couple thousand bucks (which is easier than it seems). overall an excellent title that leaves you wanting more, the class system and tree are excellent additons 10/10"
7474,Have been playing this game for years and i still love it. Cant wait to see what else Gearbox has in store for borderlands
7475,"I had to toggle a lot of things to even invite and see my friends  on the ps3 version. In here its more accessible! When GAMESPY died, we couldnt play the ps3 version of the game.  Now we are reliving the good ole dayz of grinding and number crunching in the hopes of picking up where we left off.

LET THE MAYHEM BEGIN!"
7476,"Much loot, such fun."
7477,this is a game you can play for hr and hr  love it and Borderlands 2
7478,"This game aged poorly. A lot of design decisions are archaïc to say the least and after playing over 2 hundred hours combined of BL2 and BL:TPS, this feels like a huge step backwards."
7479,"If you've ever played Borderlands 2 don't bother with this one - it feels retarded. Also, it has the lamest end boss I've seen in a while."
7480,favorite game of all time. was my childhood.
7481,"moxxy have huge honkers, massive milkers, cow-like clinkers huuuuge kowabongas"
7482,is good

7484,Please kill Claptrap.
7485,Simply the best videogame franchise.
7486,"Loot loot and more loot!!! I Own the GOTY edition on 360 and said to myself ""Why not own it on PC since the master race is so much better?"" 36 dollars later for the triple pack bundle and I don't regret it one of the games that is worth 100s of hours of my life which will now take 100s more

Plus who can say no to a RPG FPS hybrid? I know I can't"

7489,best five bux or so ever...
7490,"I loved it. All the way. It was a great experience from what i have seen, and I'm sure that I haven't seen a lot. I recommend playing with friends. Solo it can become boring at times.
All in all a great game, great story, great guns, a bit old graphics but screw that. Even in 2030 I'd love to come back and play some ol' Borderlands."
7491,"Played it through with a couple of friends. With one friend it was fun up all the way till level 30 and above, after that it's the same crap over and over."
7492,"Upon first seeing this game, I wrote it off. It looked like a mindless, generic shooter with crude humor and an overabundance of gore.

It mostly is, but it is very well done.

The crowning achievement of this series, in my opinion, is the weapon and loot system. You will likely never get the same gun as your friends, as there are thousands of stat and effect combinations.

The story is kind of dry and flat. The enemies get redundant. The characters are pretty funny, making the quests and story tollerable.

If you're looking for a shooter with good gameplay, this series is for you. If you're looking for a deep, insightful story, stay away."
7493,"Just recently got back into playing this, I forgot how amazing this game was even when compared to BL2"
7494,this is good
7495,is good play before bordelands 2
7496,Veri gud! Yaya! I recomend!
7497,Best game I ever bought.
7498,"Lags like shit , only 4 classes"
7499,"A very good game with a good story. Maybe at some parts it feels a bit unfinished but still it's worth the price. DLC's are very interesting and hilarious, also they add new campaign's, zone's and a lot more. Overall score is 9.5/10."
7500,one of my favorite games to play with my dad
7501,mad
7502,Borderlands is a great game.
7503,"tl;dr, Mix Diablo RNG with a Mad-Max wasteland and a healthy dose of dry humor.

Borderlands has long been one of my favorite video game series, as it features a number of qualities that make it different from other shooters on the market. While it does feature all the hallmarks of shooters and Role Playing Games, Borderlands mixes the ideas together. Borderlands uses RNG ala Diablo to produce many variants on each of the weapons used. 

The RPG elements also expand to action based leveling and skill points. Action based leveling increases your proficiency based weapon usage. If you use revolvers for example, each kill will increase your pistol exp until your weapon level increases. You also choose a class (a balanced soldier, melee focused brute, long ranged focused sniper, and an elemental based siren) and level up to put skill points into your skills.

+
A unique shooter
Multiple play styles, four classes
Lots of guns and lots of variations of them
Unique art style helps it stand out

-
shoddy hitboxes (ESPECIALLY for the sniper rifles)
Occasional frame-rate/pop-in issues
It's sequel is superior in every way.

8/10, this game is STILL after all this time one of my favorite games."
7504,"Borderlands is an excellent game, and it is best plaed in co-op mode. The borderlands series are easily among the top co-op games. It's sure to provide you and your friends hours of fun! The games visuals and atmosphere are uniquely original, making the world of Pandora a charming, but deadly place. Buy the game and have fun! Good luck, Vault hunter!"
7505,"I so hated this game at first. The save system absolutely sucked. You just can't quit in the middle of anything. Had to start over from a certain point AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.... BUT....
This game is also a masterpiece. There won't be a moment when you will be tired of playing this game. The gameplay is absolutely great. The weapons are uber cool and the characters are too interesting. A must play game!"
7506,"Borderlands the game where progression fucking sucks and it's extremely ResidentSleeper to get to the good parts of the game. 

BUT TRY IT THO, YOU MIGHT LIKE IT"
7507,"What do you get when you combine run and gun FPS gameplay with an MMORPG loot dropping system and Telltale's hard line art style?

You get an apocolyptic wasteland that pokes fun at all the wastelands that came before it, and with a story and sidequests that give you an insight into just how hard life is, your only real motivation is bloody mindedness, and lots of it."
7508,"A very nice FPS game made better with great co-op.  The sense of humor and amount of weapons is very impressive.  The second version added more weapons, but lost some of the humor.  Its definately worth getting especially now that its pretty cheap."
7509,I like everything about this game and would recommend it to all the viewers of this game right now! 👍🏻
7510,Buddalamps brings buddie and lamps together for ever.
7511,"This is a great game, an old classic, this is probably my current favourite RPG, it's great fun and challenging with many fights and bosses, it gets harder to level up as you go on as do your enemies to balance the game very well. It is beautiful, once you get in to it it really is fun, the graphics are a shock at the start but you adjust to them quite quickly. It is long and it keeps you interested throughout, the storyline is amazing. I've really enjoyed playing so far and it is very fun. It is diverse and at the start the boss enemies are a couple of levels higher than you so it is very challenging. With cartoony graphics it is very unique and interesting to play.

I'd rate this game 88/100"
7512,Borderlands (an RPG FPS) is very fun and entertaining. It's more fun with friends and to have a companion rather than wandering around alone in a vast wasteland doing quest. Anybody thinking about buying this game or any in this series should have a shot at it and enjoy their experience. You won't regret it.
7513,"Cool game, unique visuals :) 9.5/10"
7514,"not bad :P

7522,not as good as borderlands 2 - worse graphics
7523,"I have always been a fan of the Borderlands franchise, and having only played Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, I have got to say, the original Borderlands is so much fun... that is if you can get used to picking up everything manualy instead of just walking over it."

The loot system is just amazing seriously

7525,"by far the best FPS i've ever payed. it's a unique combination of murder, comedy, feels, aliens and fun. anything else said is unnecessery, if you don't like this game, it simply means you havn't played it yet, or you have no humor."
7526,"This game is a blast. I highly reccomend the game of the year edition when it's on sale. And if you ever choose to get it, make sure you pick up Borderlands 2 as well.

I'll give it an 8.5/10."

Nevertheless, It is a must have for a Borderlands fan !"
7533,Almost seven years later...This game is still playable and enjoyable...Of course i recommend it...One of the best games ever made....!
7534,"The start of an amazing series of games. The first version of borderlands is a fun game to play. 

There are a lot of great missions that make the story line quite good. The side missions tend to get a little repetitive, but nothing too seriously.  

The graphics are good for this (older) game.  It does look acceptable and is no downfall.

The game is filled with weapons , each more crazy than the other. 
As the story line features great boss battles and funny jokes , it was a pleasure so far playing this game. 

I Can definitly see why border lands 2 was an even bigger succes. Its like borderlands 1 except bigger and more detailled. But this game had set a very good example for the coming borderlands.

I highly recommend this game. Its cheap, Its hours of fun and it has a nice co op system, allowing you to play with friends.  

Borderlands 1 and 2 go hand in hand , as this game had set the right example and building fundaments for whats possibly the greatest fps of all time, borderlands 2..."
7535,i finished the game... [spoiler] anticlimactic ending [/spoiler] not much of a spoiler but yeah
7536,"[i][h1][b]Borderlands[/b][/h1][/i] is one of the Greatest FPS/RPG game ever made, for me. The makers of this game have twisted both the elements together very finely that you won't be bored if you're an FPS and RPG fan. Its very [b][u]AWESOME[/u][/b] if you play it with friends or not (i mean single player). In this game the hunt for bigger and better loot for guns never gets old. Its always [u][b]AWESOME[/b][/u] when you fight your way into the wave of enemies and get loot of better weapons, Shields, Class, Health, etc. and many more. You aswell face many different Bosses aswell as new soldiers to fight and after the fight when you get the access to cases you feel like you're rewarded.
Theres also Vehicles in this game,  it gave me feeling like Mad Max as bandits created a conflict in a desert area with me in a vehicle.
there are 4 vehicles in this game and some you get by buying DLC.
The main story is a blast evenn if you play it alone for Hours and hours without getting bored. and if you play it with your friends its an [u][b]AWESOME[/b][/u] experience.
I havent tried all DLC yet but still will write for what i have,

[u][i][h1]For DLC,[/h1][/i][/u]
The Secret Armory of General Knoxx starts players off in T-Bone Junction. This small town is a rest stop on a sprawling stretch of highway raised above the dry basin of an ancient sea. In other words, it looks a lot like the other stretches of beautiful wasteland in Borderlands. 
Players are required to drive a good distance along these roads to get to the surrounding areas, as there are no teleport locations. There are a few new vehicles, one of which is quite a bit faster than what appeared in the main game, but you'll eventually get tired of the extended driving segments that come with each quest. The four person Lancer allows crews to travel together, but it is slower and not much fun for two of the passengers. 
If you enjoyed Borderlands and still wanted more, then definitely buy and download The Secret Armory of General Knoxx."
7537,"This game made me gay for a bird, and I've played Hatoful Boyfriend."
7538,"A solid game from start to finish.  Enjoyable, Polished....the list goes on......"
7539,"the game excels at what it tries to do: Diablo with shotguns.
Borderlands 2 iterates and enhances the same formula, and probably should be the first game for a newcomer to the series. it does have more content. never the less, Borderlands 1 has its charm."

7541,"[h1] Gun’s Galore[/h1]

Borderlands, developed by Gearbox is an action/adventure/ballsy/Diablo loot gun/fps/co-op/RPG/ and probably some more genres included. At it’s core Borderlands thrives with co-op and endless fun. I played a good chunk of the first half of the game solo, embracing it’s mechanics, what to do, what not to do, and just plain o’l satisfying my urge to shoot an asshole/s(hint: there’s a ton of douche bags in this game). Yet, I still found myself enjoying the experience. Finishing side quests and leveling up in order to upgrade my equipment to a better standard than before. I mean why wouldn’t you go hunt for a better weapon than your current pea shooter? 

[h1] Quests & Land Folks[/h1]

 Let me break down the other aspects of Borderlands, mainly it’s questing and landmass. There are over 120+ quests in this game and a partial amount contains the main missions intertwined with the side quests you can undertake separately. I like a lot of quests personally, in order to grind. However, I found myself constantly going on side quests and couldn’t figure out the main quests mission from the side-quests(And let’s not forget the dlc’s of which there are more quests to finish!) I found myself frustrated, after endless hours grinding only to realize the main quest wasn’t in sight. Due to my lost track of time and playing co-op with some buddies of mine (of which I attribute as my fault, for not paying attention to the game-play(Doh!)

Nevertheless, once I found my bearings I was able to complete the main quests in the aftermath of my frustration. What really bugs me in this game is the lack or any quest tracking. You are only designated to track only one quest. Not 1 or 5 or 10. Just bloody 1. While I would’ve liked multiple tracking of the quests in order to finish multiple quests I realize it didn’t detract from my whole experience of enjoying the game in it’s entirety I’m only saying it out there for folks wondering what could be some negatives for them. 

With that said, let’s go to land in Borderlands. Hell, it’s enormous, there are multiple zones you can travel to and with the help of fast travel and vehicles (that can shoot guns + can load a buddy with you) I found myself quickly traversing the areas with haste and glee mowing down my enemies like a lawn mower vs. grass. It was only tedious because the target tracking for my quests on their exact position in an area was not made clear. For ex. I track a quest, then look to my fast travel to the location to go to, but there’s no indicator for it. Some quests don’t even tell you the location in their quest summary, but some do. This was somewhat frustrating for me so used to automated tracking with the location in areas. Nevertheless, I put the thought away and continued and realized if the developers intended it this way in order to make you take in the surroundings of each area more. I found such a revelation striking and thus, found myself looking at my surroundings with more awe than before. 

Until I realized I died, by gawking at structures and not paying attention to my surroundings...

[h1] Classy Fashion [/h1]

There are 4 classes you can choose from, Hunter, Soldier, Berserker, and Siren. Each has their own specialties unique to their respective classes offering different benefits and each differs from the other by having their own special ability and different sub trees. Of the trees you can input your points into there are only 3, yet differ from each class accordingly. I only played on the Soldier class which is basically a support class with a special ability of deploying a turret and three sub trees to pour my points into. The skill trees offered varieties that can suit a play style. Want to support your allies. No problem! Dump them here. Want to support your special abilities? No problem! Dump the points here. Want to support another tree for your guns? No problem! Dump them here too! While it’s not as rigid as that, merely summarized generalizations of the 3 sub-trees you can allot your points into. Each class is different and therefore offers different sub trees to spend your points on. With 1 level up = 1 point you can spend. Offering different play styles to emerge if you want to focus heavily on one tree or mix and match to suit your play style. For my soldier class I ended the game with level 35, but don’t be alarmed! You can over level up to 50 without dlc and up to 69 with dlc. 

[h1] Gimme the Gist![/h1]

In short Borderlands, begins on the planet Pandora where you a vault hunter are stringed along by some weird chick with static on the H.U.D.’s display ordering your clueless body around the planet in search of the vault. Vaults which contain secrets and mysteries unknown to some residents on Pandora, it’s kind of like a treasure hunt? In a super condensed generalized state of the game, but it’s more than that. You have to pay attention to a colorful cast of interestingly, crude, sarcastic, humorous individuals with their own set of goals. And while you can scratch they’re back for a favor to you. In Borderlands it’s not as simple as 1 to 1. You will find in its entirety the game boasts a large landmass to explore, guns to sink your teeth into big or small and quests near endless everywhere. I found no problems with the music and often would spend some time of mine roaming the lands shooting my guns at annoying pests in my vision. 

[i]Pandora you say? Well, travelers why not try it out! With so many friendly individuals to meet, wildlife to explore and gawk at, incredible landscapes and structures to take a picture of, so many loot around to pillage. Oh and let’s not forget an adorable robot called Claptrap; a funny guy to keep you entertained. Yes sir! Pandora sure is a wonderful place to visit!

Please join us in Hel- I mean Heaven!

7542,This game is the only reason that gearbox can still make games
7543,"Kill enemies, take loot, exploring a post apocalyptic environment, what's not to say about this game? Although the story may not be as developed as the second game, this is still a fun game worth your time."
7544,"Still just as fun as the first time I played it even after having owned every game in the series. I've played it twice as well as every other BL game, and now am restarting to replay again. It never gets old, especially with the DLC and character options"
7545,"+ Goofy, brainless fun. Doesn't take itself seriously. Enough variety to keep you coming back.

- Zero reasons to care about the characters or setting."

7549,Fucking shittiest ending ever..   But i still recommend it
7550,"I tried to start this game about a dozen times over the year but couldn't make it past the first hour or two because the game starts REALLY slowly .  After a few hours, however, it picks up and I couldn't put the game down for a solid week until it was completed.  I would recommend playing it with a friend or two (though I played it solo and still had a blast), and experiment with the characters and skill trees to find the one that suits your playstyle well (I have a preference for the Siren, personally).  Long story short:  It's good, but give it a few hours if it doesn't catch your attention right away."
7551,This game and the series are absolutely amazing. Its one game that is a must have in your steam library. Nuff said.
7552,One of the Great shoting games! :)

7557,Increbible *-* loveeee this game
7558,"Borderlands. Gorgeous, tons of fun, hilarious, if you never played this, do yourself a favor and pick it up."
7559,I didn't like it. I hate the desert
7560,"I first played this game back in 2009, soon after its release on the Xbox 360. From what I can remember, I spent a lot of hours and had a lot of fun playing this game. The game was addictive, trying to farm for the best loot felt rewarding, co-op was pretty fun, too (especially with friends). 

Unfortunately, this time around, I've spent most of my time on this game configuring the engine files, and trying to optomise performance without making the game look piss-poor. To put it bluntly: the PC port of this game sucks. There's no FOV slider, instead you need to edit the input files and create your own bindings (which, to be fair, wasn't difficult, it was just an inconvenience.) The video settings are pretty basic, closing the doors for graphical variety. And for some reason, enabling dynamic shadows really puts a hinder on my FPS (ranging from around 25 FPS to 40 FPS). Without it, my laptop can achieve up to 62 FPS (as that is the framecap, for whatever reason) on maximum settings relatively easily. But, the game looks shoddy, unpolished and brighter than heaven's gate.

However, the gameplay is still there, the loot is still rewarding and co-op has been restored. If you've never experienced Borderlands, I would definitely recommend it, as it's certainly a unique and unforgettable experience. The performance of the game is bearable, but it can be really distracting at times and therefore tempt you into configuring files or searching on forums for any miracle tweaks for the game. If you're like me who bought the game for a trip down memory lane, I would still recommend, but be cautious. Nonetheless, if you do buy this game, I hope you have better luck with it than I did."
7561,"9/10
An excellent FPS/RPG hybrid.  The first few hours are a bit slow and weapon balance starts sliding about lvl 30, but otherwise a great open world filled with mostly different quests and decent AI.  Controls handle well for mouse/keyboard and controller.  Most of the DLC is worth playing, although Moxxi's is best left to multiplayer.  Expect ~80 hrs to solo all the content with one character."
7562,"8/10

Playing with my girlfriend, trapped in the Skagzilla fence, both shooting and running away like crazy....
She, shouting in terror: ""Is it running after me????""
Me running as fast as I can: ""S**t, how can I know????""

Best coop game with L4D, but much more funny."
7563,"One of my all time favorites. This First Person Shooter is unlike any other first person shooter I have ever played. Hours of good fun ready to be had with this one. I loved it so much I got all the DLC, Borderlands 2, The Pre Sequel and all of the DLC for them as well minus the costumes. Not nessacery but nice if you have a favorite character you want to make even more awesome. I give this game two thumbs up!"
7564,"If you have already played BL2 and/or the TPS and are not a bit of a completionist then this game is not for you, but if you are said completionist then you will like this game. Mostly because you can complete every main mission and side mission in 30 something hours if you play Lillith. I did enjoy this game and it does feel diffrent form the other borderlands. I does feel its age though, as the port is absoulte crap, it runs fine performance wise, but in terms of just general port, its meh. As in there is no AA to speak of, you can however force it in your drivers. The gun anumations are lack luster, aswell E and R are bound to reload, wich you cant dissable through the in game settings. And the splash screens when the game boots up are un-skipable by default. Also the game has no Mac or linux port, but it does however run fine through wine.
Dispite its downfalls I can recomend this game, now I just have to get %100 completion."
7565,"Very addicting game.

It gets really good when you're playing the DLC"
7566,i love this game but i have just upgraded to windows 10 and it is now running like crap is there something i an do to fix this
7567,"I'm dictating this to a man in my padded cell.
They haven't let me back out since the incident
""Man Slaugters Thousands of Midgets!
A man that was at the largest Target in the world suddenly took a shotgun out of his backpack and then proceded to shoot every adult person under 4ft. The shotgun had the following etched into it ""Jakobs"" we do not know if this is a terrorist group or a single insane person's mindset. Sources say this is from the game 'Borgenlander' although we can not confirm this.""
That was a clipping from last weeks newspaper. I can't tell you why I did it but I know it might happen again, best I'm locked up in this cell. in my straighjacket. alone."
7568,really fun game i would definitely buy this game especially if youll play them all
7569,Tbh it's kinda meh after you've played BL2. It's not terrible but everything just seems so empty and lonely. DLCs are kinda nice.
7570,"Do you have friends? You're going to love this game.
Do you not have friends? You're still going to love this game.

Also, GUNS."
7571,"Guns! Guns! and more ... Guns!
"
7572,"     Don't let my hours played fool you. I played this for probably 200+ hours on the xbox. I just had to buy this for my gaming cpu, it's that good. This game broke me of my World of Warcraft addiction!

     Before you buy the other borderlands series, you need to play this to appreciate the collection. This game will teach you the basics that you'll need for the other games. Plus the story jives with the others. Speaking about the story, man its told really well. The humor is well timed and done really well. Even during battles, the charater callouts are really funny!!!!

     The gameplay is like Diablo, where you shoot and loot, except you don't pull mass amounts of mobs and burn them down. The challenege is there, even for a 200+hour vet like me.  Multiplayer is even more fun as mobs scale for more players. More scaling also equals better loot as well. 

     The graphics are really nice. It is cell shading, but it's done really nicely. Animations are done really well as well. I hold graphics in the same line as gameplay and I was really satified with this game (personal prefences, and why I dont play indie games)

     To keep this short, BUY THE GAME!!! Even at full price! It's a must have 10/10! It runs well on a lot of different systems as it was made for the xbox 360."
7573,"if you like a first person shooter to play with your friends this is the game for you. this game is awsome and i enjoy playing it with friends.

7580,not as good as 2 so buy 2 if you can but still great game
7581,"An incredible experience. 
A bazillion of guns, great loot system, awesome characters, great sense of humor, lots of content, 4 awesome DLC'S and also an awesome story.
Borderlands is one of my favorite games of all time. It never gets boring.
Oh yeah, also... This game is videogame-heroin. It is SOOOO addictive"
7582,"GUNS , EXPLOSION, BADASS, SEXY LADY :D CHECK IT OUT XD"
7583,"Pros:
+ Great soundtrack
+ Cel shaded art style which has aged quite well
+ Time of day changes as you play
+ Environmental design is very good which counters the fact that textures don't always hold up
+ Tons of weapons to collect and use
+ Great writing and voice acting; it genuinely made me laugh
+ Character and boss intro's add to the game's charm
+ It has Claptrap
+ Upgrade system feels fluid
+ Fun solo and even more fun with friends

Cons:
- When talking to an npc to receive a mission you have to scroll using PageUp/PageDown to read them at that time
- Lot of settings missing from the menu (vsync, toggle aim, fov slider, fps unlock/cap, anti-aliasing)
- Audio sliders are not as precise as you'd want them to be, only able to change the volume by 10% at a time
- [i] It has Claptrap[/i]
- Can't scroll with a mouse in the main menu and instead have to use the up/down keys
- Hitting the Use key reloads your gun
- Maybe this is more my opinion than an actual con; very limited inventory space which feels weird for a game with tons of weapons/items
- The fov can be a dealbreaker; this can be changed in the config though  that does not seem to work for some people

While the Enhanced version arguably looks better and has more options, it also is the buggiest and most unreliable one.
The original GOTY version of Borderlands plays just as well if not better, without any of the extra issues."

7595,"Sad to say I literally just started my Borderlands journey. I wanted to start out with the 1st one, and continue in the order they came out. So far, I love the first one. It is funny, and I love the animations. I turned the graphics all the way up so it looks more sharp, but I love it. Funny for sure."
7596,"i liked this game, the gun technology is quite awesome. there bosses are very dramatic and entertainting. the storyline is good and the gameplay excellent."
7597,"Oh the origins... :) If you like any of the borderlands games, you will like this one too. But don't expect it to be better then the 2nd."
7598,good game 10/10
7599,"During the first playthrough I got only to 2nd location and then said meh, and stopped playing. Later I gave the game another shot and I am happy I did so, it got to me and I played it through and through, all missions, primary and secondary plus DLC. It is loot based FPS action RPG with some good parodic humor and badassness all over."
7600,it's game awesome
7601,"Experiance the Game that started a whole new francise, Explore the border world Pandora as you run, gun and shoot everything with legs, with the aim of getting the biggest gun to aid you in your quest to open the legendary Vault, fabled to hold loot of epic value, but be prepaired for a long journey on your quest for loot and maybe the truth behind the Vault.."
7602,"addictive and fun, definitely a must buy!"
7603,i love screaming for 20 years in broderbunds
7604,"outrageous and brash, tons of fun.  the DLC considerably lengthens the playtime and the character upgrades.  boatloads of loot.  love the comic-style graphics!"
7605,"I wouldn't recommend this game. I got bored in the first two hours of gameplay. I find the gameplay boring because I think it was designed to be long-lasting but they only dragged the story long with implementing a lot of ""Go from A to B, kill someone and come back to A."" moments. The fight-machanics are repatitive aswell and the overall game disappointed me. Do not buy this game when not in a sale, if you want it. Just to be sure that you won't have too much of a lost."
7606,Top-notch.
7607,"I tried to like the game. I really like the graphic design, and the sense of humor seems to be a good match, but the game is simply unengaging. 

I was told that the game isn't fun unless you're playing with others, and I could see that being the case. Without someone to play with, there's nothing to keep you coming back. The gameplay is solid, but I can get solid gameplay in many other games in which I do not have to suffer through an almost nonexistent story and even more pointless subquests. 

My question is, why would co op make it any better? I still feel as if I would decide to play something else regardless."
7608,"Set out to get borderlands 2, I was on the page, clicked buy, It got me borderlands 1. I'm glad it did.

7609,Fun Game and decent story

7620,"Great shoot and loot game, Think of it as diablo with guns. Also the more peolpe the more fun.
My only complaints are its not that optimizable for pc and with out DLC there is not much end game content."
7621,"Very fun RPG. I came in not expecting much after playing it (and not enjoying it) previously on console, but it felt way better on PC and was actually a great game. Some side quests were annoying and repetitive, and the main story felt way too short and kind of disappointing, but the gameplay itself was extremely fun and finding weapons was enjoyable. I'd give it a 7 or 8/10 because the gameplay was extremely enjoyable, and that's really what matters in a game."
7622,"step 1: mess up getting into the game 40 times by picking a class you don't want, forget how to start game, take 20 hours to load
step 2: finally get into game, do quests untill the end of time with all the fancy gear in teh world
step 3: ???
step 4: profit"
7623,"In short: I don't really get what all the hype is for. (I also don't really understand why I've been playing this game for almost 100 hours, both co-op and solo. Probably achievements.)

Borderlands is a decent mix of influences and game elements - Mad Max meets Idiocracy, Diablo meets Call of Duty.

It probably would have had a whole lot less success if it did not drop the more serious tone it was going for early in development in favor of tongue-in-cheek humor and cartoonish cell shaded graphics. DLCs also abandoned all pretense of subtlety subsequently and went all out - zombies, psycho claptraps, the works.

GOOD
+ melds RPG mechanics with FPS gameplay (and one of the few to do so)
+ 4 different characters (theoretically) support 4 different gameplay archetypes and these were designed for co op play from the start
+ anesthetics are quite nice - Unreal engine 3 good looks + cell shaded style
+ great diversity in weapons - procedurally generated (different colors, scopes and barrels all viewable in-game) and with multiple rarity tiers distilled into 7 or so major weapon types and a couple dozen unique weapon effects
+ good production values - animation, sound design, character design and voice-overs are all pretty great
+ some of the writing and dialogue is genuinely funny if you've got the patience to go through it
+ ultimately, it's a decent time filler - run around, shoot things, loot, cash-in, rinse, repeat

BAD
- the story is about as shallow as your ex-girlfriend and all characters have as much depth as a bath tub

- core gameplay kind of sucks - enemies are brain-dead bullet sponges, the bazillion of different weapons all feel like pea-shooters, quests become absurd chores after a while. All player characters (including bad-ass-Brick) feel like weak sissies that go down after a few enemy shots if you don't use cover

- crappy ARPG implementation and FPS don't mix very well - it doesn't really matter how ""good"" you are within the game, what really matters is the arbitrary number that describes your level. That in turn determines what arbitrary damage numbers your weapons inflict upon your enemies... It's a ""Woah did you see how high that number went?"" type of game, from an FPS perspective. Not exactly ideal.

- the game is artificially prolonged because of this as well - killing enemies a good couple of levels above yours is almost impossible (unless you're willing to literally chip at them from a safe position for something like an hour). Progress a bit through the game however, and surprise, an hour and couple of XP levels later you'll be able to run them over in a couple of shots. 

- co-op play isn't that much fun either  - you tend to fast forward through the game (enjoying it less along the way) and race to open all the chests to get all the loot before your mates do

- you have vehicles, in-game maps and objective markers - but somehow Borderlands manages to be one of the worst games out there when it comes to spatial awareness. Identical environments + horrible in-game map + claustrophobic FOV = ""Dude where's my car?""

- oh, the FOV is locked for some reason at a vomit-inducing value under 90, and requires editing game files (or installing a separate program) to bind a key to be able to change it at a desired value. You will be using this key throughout the entire game - every time the you load, on vehicle entry/exit and on map change. (really?)

- the interface is kind of clunky and simplistic and also lacks some of the features that could support the RPG elements - you don't have a proper way of comparing multiple weapons and you need to consult a wiki online to fully understand what some of the unique weapon effects do (the game does not bother helping you)

- soundtrack is sparse, bleak and repetitive (much like the game :D)

- some of the DLCs feature crap hoarding achievements - you literally need to kill thousands of enemies to gather X number of rare dropping items such as ""panties"", ""3D glasses"" and ""oil cans"" that barely make any sense and exist only to squeeze a good couple of hours of gameplay out of achievement hunters"
7624,So many guns
7625,"I love this game! All of the maps are very detailed and the enemies are awesome! So many missions to keep you busy, I just can't stop playing!"
7626,Essential comedy/FPS/Grind fest
7627,"One of many reasons why there should be ""neutral"" grade avaiable while writting review. 
Let me explain why I ""more do not recommend than recommend"" this game right now. So please do not eat me now, just read! 

First Borderlands is still a very good game, back in release it was really something new: first pure kid of RPGxFPS romance, smooth and enjoyable gameplay with unusual cell-shading graphics... BUT I do not recommend buying this game right now for couple of reasons. Most important one is just: next releases are clearly better in ALL possible ways. 
Both B2 and P-S have:

- Better optimalization
- Better graphics
- Better interface
- Better Story with more interesting dialogues and storytelling overall + more backstories due ECHO logs etc.
- More enemies
- Better loot system / More weapon parts
- Improved vehicles
- More interesting quests 
- Better skill trees
- Much more puns and funny moments/memorable personas
- Better and more interesting locations 
- More colors
- Better end-game
- Probably more ""Better(...)"" stuff

So game itself is still good, but when you compare it to next ones (or even without it - just look at it from 2016) it is kinda boring and much more repetitive than back in release. 

And that`s why I do not recomment getting this game right now, at least not without high discount for GOTY edition (5-10 euro/$ is fine) and only if you really want to have experimental blast-from-the-past or just to get some future references, but there are not so many of them and you can read about them on Wiki aswell."

7629,this is a great game from gameplay footage I watched. but my BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS THAT I CAN'T PLAY IT! MY COMPUTER GETS 1 TO 2 FPS WHEN I PLAY!

Definitely recommended."
7634,"I love this game, as well as BL2 and TPS. I find it very replayable and the DLCs are fantastic for the most part."
7635,"It was that moment, when 2K knew they didn`t fucked up. Even through years this game is still one of the best shooters for me. And it's still fun. And the ending is still bullshit"
7636,"As someone who has played games since the age of 8 (that's 18 years on the trott now), I can safely say this is one of the most addictive games I've ever played. 

The amount of things you can do in the game is staggering. You choose how want to progress through the missions, either you stick to the plot ones to the storyline, or you can choose to do all the other missions and side missions first and come back to the main ones.

There are 4 playable characters, each with their own special skill and focus regarding weaponry. The game uses a experience based progression system helping the player level up. After each level the player gains a skill point that they can choose to apply in 3 different branches for their character, thereby choosing the attributes they want. 

In terms of the graphics, the game uses a almost cartoon like style. Some of the maps really are huge with a generous amount of detail within. 

There are a couple of glitches and bugs, but not enough to detract from the wonderful game experience. If you haven't played any of the games in the Borderlands series, do yourself a favour and pick this first one up. It is the most streamlined of all the games, but in no way lacking in quality.

If you have played Borderlands 2 and have heard that this is boring comparitivaly ignore that notion. Just be a man and play it anyway. It has a slow pick up, but hey, don't all of em have that? Just play it"
7646,"this game is nowhere near as well polished or as expansive as Borderlands 2, BUT that being said it is one of the greatest games ive ever palyed. 

The characters that you can play as offer very different play styles so that the game is as fresh as can be. the weapons offer a lot of variety to you as well. 

The story is non existent but the combat is something to scacrafice virgins to. is that a wierd way to say it maybe but its true."
7647,love this fucking game

7655,"I dont know if this game has something negative.Just the best,especially with friends."
7656,"*tldr* bang bang fun fun

So an awesome channel I watch on YouTube called extra credit recently made a video on destiny calling it a comfort food game. I feel that fits well here. It's something you can play any time, with friends or by your self, for any amount of time you have to devote to it. Got 30 minutes? Play a side quest. Got an hour? play a story quest or two. 3 friends online and bored? play borderlands. This game has great gun play, a huge number of guns and massive replayability. You don't need a boss computer to run it OK ether. Not any harder to run then left for dead. It's easy fun and addictive. If your looking for a good game to waist more then a few hours with you won't be disappointed. 

*Disclaimer* the story isn't much to wright home about. The characters are memorable but shallow and 1 dimensional. Like old comic book characters. Not a deal breaker surprisingly. As someone who is all about the emersive story I must say the game play is that addictive."

7664,"Have played this game a lot originally on xbox360 when it first came out, so I have more time invested into the game that my steam account lets on.

Story wise the game is very good, interesting plot with plenty of interesting and funny characters, which is one of the best parts of this game. There is plenty of side quests available too, add on top the play through 2 and 2.5 you can do and you easily have hundreds of hours of game to play.

Gameplay is solid with good and simple controls, weapons are RNG based making it very unlikely you'll see the same weapon twice. Accuracy rating on guns can make it look like the aiming system isn't good but that's what it's there for, otherwise the only upgrades you can get would be damage and RoF. 
You can play this with 3 friends in online co-op which is the main selling point of Borderlands in my  opinion, which leads to endless fun.

If you're bored and fancy shooting, exploding or running over shit then this is a game you should try."

7667,"Borderlands is still my personal favorite of the three games that have been released (excluding Tales).Maybe it's a nostalgia thing, but it's honestly a pretty damn good game. It has good replay value. Pick it up on sale as it is old."
7668,"Have alot of gaming to catch up on boarderland's was a game i wanted while.   definelty worth the 19.99 I payed for it. 


What it Differs from other mmo-rpg     
The action is realtime and no recharge on the the weapon abillty's
Also work like a fps should with mmo element's

great game definelty buy if you haven't"

7675,"One of the best games I played with my sister, I wish there was a split screen mode because it would be cool like if you're playing on a xbox 360 platform :) Even with the update there is no split screen oof ."
7676,"I have loved the Borderlands series for years, and it all started with the first one on Xbox (I own Borderlands, Borderlands 2, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel for Xbox 360) and I have to say, getting 1 and 2 on PC was an amazing idea!  It runs really well on my laptop, and can even go between the keyboard/mouse combo and an xbox controller.  I haven't had any frames drop yet, and it controls fairly smoothly with the controller.  Plus, I can play online with friends for free, instead of buying an xbox subscription and never getting a chance to play.  I've also enjoyed the semi-realistic but still cartoony art style, and the humor is always great, there's even some pop culture references if you listen hard enough.  I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes to play single player games or co-op, because even when you beat the main storyline in the game once, there's quite a bit of replay value in achievements and a second phase where you replay from the beginning but everything is at a higher level.  The DCL for the first Borderlands has been my favorite bunch so far, and the bosses are actually pretty difficult.  Seriously, a great series all around.  10/10."

This is a game about four friends that decide to take a vacation to the city of Detroit.  Isn't it?  For 50+ hours surrounded by trash and filth, this game makes it pretty fun.  They put a lot of effort into the worldbuilding, and everything compliments that:  the visuals, the characters, and even the tongue-in-cheek manner that the game constantly refusing to take itself seriously while creating a genuinely interesting world.  And, I really love the creativity that went into the art style.  The story is fun, largely non-serious, but still somehow deep.  You'll find yourself curious about what comes next even as the plot rolls its eyes at itself.  This game expertly blends RPG and FPS elements in a coherent way that makes both important and gives the player plenty of customization options while keeping skill essential.  And, the coop is brilliant...wait, no, sorry, the coop is briliant.  This game is extremely well done.  I'd recommend playing it coop with friends as that's where this game really shines.  Anyway, this was a cool journey, and I'll probably do it again sometime.  I look forward to be eaten by skags."

7694,"Had it on Xbox, got rid of it when i got rid of my Xbox, but theres something about the cartoonish excessively violent style of the game that just draws you in. Its a decent FPS, although i am not too happy with the guns in that they are incredibly inaccurate at lower levels and even as you get higher up you really have to find that needle in a haystack of a weapon that you'll probably hold onto for the rest of the game simply because its so accurate. Im unhappy with the fact that you cant really customize your player too much (whichever person the class is thats who you play: IE: Siren is only female, only that one build, same with the soldier, sniper, and zerker.) With all that being said, its a fun game, with a surprisingly good storyline. I got the game because of the action and the crazyness, but i came back for the awesome story, and because the GOTY edition was 7$ >_>."
7695,Excellent game
7696,"This is one of the best FPS games that i have played and would reccomend to anyone who loves GUNS, GUNS and MORE GUNS!!"
7697,"An MMO / FPS hybrid that doesn't quite deliver

- solid shooting and movement mechanics
- a nice selection of varied classes
- expansive areas that require you to drive around (a lot) rushing from one quest to another, 
- enemy variety is limited to humanoids and wildlife for the majority of the game
- weapon variety is hit or miss, most of the weapons you'll pick up are going to be garbage and the higher quality items aren't all that special in comparison
- cringe-worthy humour and an overarching story that fails to draw you in
- dull fetch / kill X number of enemies quests

A large chunk of your time in Borderlands is going to be spent driving around barren and visually unappealing environments, killing the same handful of enemy types and selling items since most of the gear you'll collect on your journey is going to be complete vendor trash. The only reason you might buy the game is if you're desperate for a co-op shooter and even then I'd strongly suggest looking elsewhere, [b] whatever you do don't buy the  DLC [/b] since it easily contains some of the worst, most padded, poorly written and just plain boring content in the entire game."

7711,i love the Borderlands series; have completed  1/2 and Pre-sequel. The amount of humor and crude jokes abundant. One of the best FPSs out there.
7712,"At first, the FOV may seem a little wonky, but I actually got used to it really fast (I tried fixes and most weren't optimal enough). The loot system in this one already seems more rewarding and entertaining than in BL2, but it also has a lot less of the story feel to it, giving it more of a ""lone bounty hunter"" kind of feel instead."
7713,01/01 NGI
7714,"Love this fucking game, a lot of guns, guns, guns, guns, as fuck"
7715,This is a really fun game for anyone out there the only problem i have with this game is that some cutsences you are stuck in a 30 fps but other than that its amazing game
7716,Played for 80 minutes and then returned it. This game gets very lonely when played by yourself. Great game but couldn't play solo.
7717,"A fun and great game to kill some time, my only problems are that it freezes sometimes then your forced to go to task manager to kill the game to get out of it and it can sometimes change resolution when that happens also it dosent autosave either when it freezes and if you like graphics dont expect much from this... 

a side from that its a good game if your new to borderlands or you bought it for the same reason i did (I never beat it on PS3)"
7718,"I beat this game and it's DLCs many times on my PS3 back when there was no Borderlands 2. I haven't beat it again on my PC, but i come back to it every now and again just because the gameplay is SO good. Borderlands found the perfect way to mix RPG and FPS games and I will never grow tired of it. It will never get old and will always have a special place in my heart. Games like this make me wish there was more time in a day or a way I could play several games at once. If I had more time, I could play it and the several other games I'd like to play each day. But alas, I am forced to choose. I should make more of a priority to play it. And as for you, if you haven't played this game yet, give it a shot. Most likely you've at least heard about it-well, hopefully those things were good because the only downside to the original Borderlands is it's pretty much total lack of a story, but as I played it for the gameplay and never really for the story, I never really had a problem with that. But if a rich story is a key factor for you, this might not be the game for you."
7719,i like this product
7720,"I dislike First Person Genre, but I love Borderlands, that's how good this game is."
7721,"Positive :

-CO-OP

Negative:

- some bugs"
7722,"Only 18 hours on PC as of writing this but I spent over 100 hours on PS3.
This game I find to be a great mixture of a more traditional RPG and a solid FPS. While the game is generally of a slower pace than Borderlands 2, it is more genuine.
This was definitely a passion project, seeing what 2K could do and how people would receive it. I remember buying this game back in 2009. I hadn't really heard about it but it was a co-op game and I had a friend from out of town over. So I bought it, and we spent the night playing the game. Both of us immediately attached to the game because it hit all the checks from our mutual WoW addiction. 
The shooting is solid, guns are varied (for the time), enemies are satisfying to kill, and the progression system works great. The more classical three splitting branches of the skill tree work the way you expect it to, and you level up enough to take elements from each tree. The environments vary throughout the game, with a separation between more ""open"" area's and more special areas that act almost as instances or dungeons.
This is not a deep experience, this is a shallow game but with moderately deep RPG elements. But that is fine, because the game was never advertised as anything else than just a game to go through the motions and kill things."
7723,"Played co-op with a friend thru the campaign.  Fantastic game, playing multi-player co-op is great.  Really enjoyed it.  This is my second playthru of the game, and I used to not recommend this game(in the single player), but ive totally changed my opinion now, and do recommend it for a great co-op experience with a friend."
7724,"Maybe i had too much expectations, but for me the gameplay is repetativ and the ""hunt"" for new weapons is disappointing because you need it against the stronger enemies..so your loved weapon, you throw it away after one hour of playing and replace it for the next best weapon because you have no choice"
7725,Your a Badass if you play this game!
7726,"This game gave me a horrible syndrome - wherever I go, I open boxes, check drawers, look in toilets, I even dig up piles of dog crap to look for loot. 

10/10 would look in pile of shit again"
7727,good
7728,"BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT

(totally not hypnotizing tall)"
7729,"What's gritty and has dark humor as well as every other humor? This game of course..... 

STORY (10/10):
The game has a lot of characters but what's great about this is that it was able to give players a huge backdrop of Pandora with each meeting of these characters. The story has players journeying from the deserted wasteland to the snowy peaks of a mountain. With the DLCs, it also give players more story to players.

MUSIC/ART (10/10):
The music, I left off in my run through of this game, but I'm sure it has a great track to go along with this game. As for the design of the whole game, you could feel the atmosphere of every detail from the game. You can even see the level of detail to your gun too since it has so many different types of guns as well as its own decals.

GAMEPLAY (8/10):
The game has a combine genres of RPG and FPS which is reminiscent of the Fallout franchise or the Elder Scrolls game. There are of course 4 playable characters and each have their own skill tree, abilities, and unique twist to their weapon stats. Speaking of weapons, the game has a huge randomizer that makes collecting really fun since you can never assume what you will find killing enemies or opening chests. As for enemies, they are difficult to fight as you start but the higher you climb in the level ups, the better you get beating their arses. The co-op/multiplayer mode of this game is also a key feature because it allows the drop-in/drop-out ways of players. It also makes it fun when you are hanging out with 3 other friends.

TOTAL SCORE - (10/10)

PS - My let's play of this game (ran pretty poorly because I had a potato for a PC at the time). And yes, I've played every single mission on the main game and DLCs.

7731,"Beat the game. All DLC. Never touched NG+, don't intend to and I don't feel incentive to. Borderlands is iconic because... It's fucking Borderlands dude.

9/10"
7732,"Absolutely a blast to play even 8 years after it came out, I will never not be up for another playthrough. The gunplay is fun and frantic and the loot system is absolutely insane. The story is nothing to write home about but there are bits of comedy sprinkled in that are just gold. Everyone should play this is they like shooters, or rpgs."
7733,"Just a short review.
As you can see, I put a lot of hour into the game. Mostly solo.
It's good fun. Endless variations of weapons and shields, lots of customisation possible with your character skills.

I have one bad thing to mention about this game. That is after you finish the second playthrough, all enemies will scale to your level and above. This means even if you return to the starting area, you still have a good chance to get murdered. To me, this is a very bad thing. I would prefer there to be no scaling or maybe just scaling in later game areas. The fun of 1 hitting enemies that you get used to by being overlevveled through the game, suddenly gets replaced by this wall. The enemies take little damage - even with pearlescent quality weapons. It just loses it's fun to make you feel like a noob when you are at your level cap of 69. Of course, you can play slow and safe and probably not die but by level 69, you don't want to be standing still too much.

Anyway, other than that, it's a good fun game. Online play is ok too although a little sparse now. Go get it."
7734,"Чуваки, ставьте игру, помогите большой и сложный квест пройти - убить кромеракса!

hey everyone, could you give us a hand in killing crawmerax?"
7735,The ending of this game reminds me of my prom. A big surprise at the end that felt rushed and unsatisfying.
7736,"Awesome game with loads of side quests and a fun main quest. The list of weapons and upgrades to your character is huge, Totaly worth the money plus 4-5 DLC packs at a price."
7737,"Borderlands is an amazing First Person Role Playing Shooter in a sense. It has a great leveling system, tons of loot to make your character stronger, and a very neat and organized skilltree. The story could have been better but its still acceptable due to the DLC and the amazing gameplay mechanics. There are some glitches that you can access and odd things happening, but its nothing game breaking. The soundtrack is also pretty good but it needed a lot more for how big the game truly is. So far even on a low end pc the graphics are decent and the gameplay is smooth. I didnt excpect it to be good on my pc. I am not saying every pc can play it but keep in mind I do not have a graphics card to run on its own. I currently have a processer with a built in graphics card.

All in all this game is a solid 9 in my honest opinion (on a scale of 10). I love practically everything about it and Ive been playing it for many many years. Pretty much since it came out. I definetally recommend this and all the DLC to everyone who has yet to buy and or play it."
7738,i want more trading cards
7739,"Good game, for a single playthrough, after that you are trapped in a skinner box of loots and achievements."
7740,Amazing game. Just buy it already
7741,"This is a game I originally played on the xbox and had a lot of fun with, so I ended up getting it on the PC. From what I can tell, it seems to play very well, I haven't had many issues with frame drops, but they have occurred, but nothing to make it unplayable. This game has a lot of guns and shields to find and equip, which I like, it keeps things fresh and new when wondering around, and keeps you excited for the next weapons crate.


The weapon system itself is pretty cool, it generates a infinite amount of weapons so you there is no end to the weapons you can get. This helps prevent running into the same gun a bunch of times, however it has happened once or twice. I like the mechanics themselves and think as a shooter this game is pretty well done. I don't have much to say other then its a really good game that everyone should try out if they are into the FPS genre. 

The leveling system is pretty cool, and I really like it. The more you use specific type of gun the higher you “Proficiency” level with that type gets. This overtime gives larger clips, faster reloads, less recoil, and more damage. Its not a huge boost but its enough to make a difference when you are playing. Towards my endgame on the xbox I had a assault rifle that could empty its entire 130 round clip in 2 seconds and reload in less than 1 second. My perks and levels in that weapon were enough to make it extremely good and deadly in fights. So make sure you use the kind of gun you like the most a lot so you can powerlevel your proficiency with it!

The perks are a cool feature that I liked, you can choose between three perk trees that give a variety of bonuses and effects. This allows you to tune your character to your liking and your gameplay style. It can really change the game depending on how you allocate your perks. 

Overall gameplay is a pleasure, on xbox I clocked over 400 hours on this game, both online and offline. I have not played it very much on PC because when I bought it I still had it on xbox and more a less tired myself of it, but I will go back and play it again soon, because it has a lot more to do with DLC! And the DLC for this game really adds a good amount of content, and its really worth the money in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this to a friend."
7742,probably one of the most fun games i have ever played
7743,"""This planet smells like haemorrhoids"""
7744,"Borderlands 2 is one of my favorite games ever, so I was excited to go back and play this game for the first time. I have to say I'm very disappointed with it. The humor that fueled the narrative of BL2 just isn't here so it's a rather dull slog through bland trash heap after bland trash heap. 

And the controls feel clunky and just unfun. I played BL2 with a keyboard and mouse but I couldn't stand it because I spend most of my time running and gunning but if you tap left or right while running forward, it breaks your run into a walk. For me it kills the fast-paced nature of the combat. I tried switching to a controller and that somewhat helps the running issue. It still does not feel as smooth as the BL2 movement and strafing and of course aiming is not as easy with control sticks.

I forced myself through the main game, but it's one of those rare cases where I wasn't having any fun playing. The DLC started adding in the fun personality that permeates BL2 but it's too little too late and I really don't want to subject myself to any more of this game. 

Oh, and the game has massive screen tearing issues, at least on my rig. They don't give you a VSync option in the menu so the only way to fix it is to go into the game engine's config files and set it to use VSync yourself."
7745,Much Fun. Many Wow. 10/10 would play again
7746,What are you waiting for? Those psycho midgets aren't going to blow themselves up....oh wait....
7747,its good its just dead
7748,Ive always loved borderlands since the day it came out and will never stop loving it
7749,"Borderlands is a fun co-op game, although there are a few features that makes it obvious it was designed for a console, which is unfortunate since the PC has so many benefits in terms of control features (77 buttons + a mouse).  But all in all, great experience with great humor."
7750,"Buy it, it's good"
7751,One of the most awesome games I have ever player!!!
7752,This is a great game if you and 3 friends are looking for something to play or if even you just want to paly solo. I  was fortunate enough to play with 3 friends and i'd like to say we had a ball with endless laughs.
7753,"Very fun game, good story, good humor, great game all around"
7754,If you only played the game once. you wont playing Borderlands.
7755,Awesome and funny game if anywonna wonts to play whit me add me!
7756,I love this game. If it was a woman I would make babies with it BUY OR I WILL FIND YOU AND KILL YOU.
7757,"Years after its release, still a classic to goto for some great fun."
7758,"If you don't have anybody to play with, do yourself a favor and don't play this game. The game is still fun on your own, but you do really need someone playing with you, especially if it's your first time playing. Pick it up on a sale, get a couple of friends, and have fun exploring the wasteland, blowing stuff up, and picking up lots of loot."
7759,"The prequel to Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and the Post-Pre-Sequel to Sequel to the beginning of after the Apocalypse, but before John Madden ruled the wastelands with an iron fist and Terry Bradshaw fought the Truckasaurus to save the chainsaw wielding gorillas from the wrath of the Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers in their evil volcano lair atop Mt. Awesome."
7760,I would have to say this game is the true master piece of the 3 the've made so far. The Pre-Sequel is not to even be talked about was awful and just a way to make more money I assume with how little the game was how boring it got and just gravity being annyoing. Borderlands 2 was better in a lot of aspects but was also horrible in some as in the HP was really stupid and so was the shield and the weapon dmg. You have a gun that deals over a million dmg and takes 2 minutes to kill something. The stats were just way too high and a awful idea but with the first one they pretty much nailed everything just need more dlc for me to download. Lost my social life playing in 2009 and yes my steam hours is not my true time a lot was on xbox 360 and a cracked version. Still amazing to this day here in 2018 !
7761,Boooooring as f!@#!!! I've done anything to keep playing it but managed to do it only for couple hours...game is boring (really BOOOORING)...after i faced a bug which makes it impossible to finish one mission i was totally done playing it...biggest disapointment of long time...uninstalled and never gonna run it again for sure...thankfully game is old and it didnt cost me too much...ah man it is so crappy game....
7762,Amzing game everyone and any one should give it a go
7763,I mean its best game of 2009 year.
7764,I hihgly recommend co-op. The more the merrier.
7765,"It's not really an evaluation, much more a tribute for a game I played a lot and still enjoy playing it :)

Even if replaying it kinda feel repetitive, after a while you just feel ""cosy at home"". Even if the enemies sometimes lacks variation, hunting for your favorite set of weapons and exploring new builds is still fun.

On my own, I mostly play Mordecai with a rapid-fire Torment repeater, a multi-pellet Masher revolver and an explosive Wrath sniper rifle. Once I got these three, the whole game is a joyful ride (plus, repeaters and revolvers feed the same weapon skill bar, so why not taking advantage of it?)

I also found the ""alternate stories"" really interesting each one on its own. I really love the mood and pacing of Jacob's Cove (the zombiesque twist on Borderlands).

Even if the more recent instances of the title (namely Borderlands 2 and Borderlands Prequel) are better balanced and provide more challenges, the original title is still strong on its feet."
7766,i wasnt even aware i had the first borderlands in my account but anyways i played this on console many years ago and i would do it again
7767,"This is probably my favorite shooter RPG there is... if you don't count the sequel and pre-sequel.

The leveling system is awesome and I love the sheer amount of different weapons that you can collect."
7768,"Comic graphics. Who don't like it?
Funny game. Who don't like it?
RPG, Who don't like it?
Co-op.Who don't like it?
LOT OF LOOT,Who don't like it?
Many weapon.Who don't like it?
Borderlands is perfect. Who don't like it?"
7769,"Still a good game. It lacks in terms of options menu, but it has story, characters, a LOT of guns. You're going to enjoy it if you like grinding for loot in games."
7770,"Great game,actually harder than Borderlands 2,in my opinin."
7771,i love series...and i did play this one first before playing any of the others... soooooo i really took to it and enjoyed playing but honestly after playing 2 and presequal i just cant get into the first one anymore. Especially after getting to use the mini map in the corner... its sucks not having one.
7772,"When I first saw this game series, I was uninterested, unimpressed. Upon playing it, however, I've come to enjoy the style of the design and the game play. It's a good, funny game, that does warrant laughs, with an interesting storyline, though it could be better developed and integrated. The control setup is simple and easy to remember, and the sights on the guns were well created. On the topic of guns, there are a variety of guns with different attributes, allowing for all styles of fighting. The sounds effects and music are also very appealing. The game allows for a certain amount of guns to be quickly equiped, which becomes extremely helpful in the fast paced battles.

I would say, though, that the spawning system can be annoying for me, as I can't go back a few feet to sell some things then return without the enemies being spawned back. It wouldn't be an issue, but the enemies don't like to give up on you, so they pursue you instead of giving up when you get far enough away. It also is a little lacking in variety of side quests, and the rewards for simply adventuring aren't that great. 

Overall, my complaints are paled in comparison to the quality of the game, and I would implore you to get this game, although also look into Borderlands 2, get the Game of the Year edition if you ever plan on buying a DLC for this game, and always consider waiting for a sale."
7773,"A fantastic game
10/10 do recommend"
7774,Claptraps are evil.
7775,"A tad dated, but a pretty great game."
7776,This is a great game  it really is.. but right now it keeps breaking and giveing the GPE  and you have to just do random shit till something works.. And right now that just makes it unplayable  so untill that issue is fixed i cant Recommend spending money on the PC version of the game untill thats fixed
7777,"This game is just as great in single player as it is in coop, so don't stay away just because you don't have anyone to play with. I played about half the game on my own before I conviced my wife to join me just because I loved it so much. The only parts where you might feel frustrated because you don't have anyone to help you, and that's the vehicle destruction missions."
7778,"8.7/10

No story, but fun to play if you love RPG's"
7779,WHA CHU WANT
7780,"If you like FPS and RPGs, this series is one of the best blends of both genres out there.

While the sequel is MUCH better, this is still solid to let you get used to the world.

I do recommend this game, but not at full price.  It goes on sale often, wait until it's around $5."
7781,"It's got easy levels, tough levels, some guns, some more guns, a few more guns and then just when you think there's not enough guns, even more darn guns!!  

I seem to sell more guns than you steal in GTA!!  But never the less there's always a rocket launcher if you get bored with the usual guns......

Buy the game when it's on offer, with all the DLCs..  I've only started playing as the solider and it's taking me hours to get through it and I'm only on level 24 at the mo...  
If you love your FPS games, then you will more than likely, love this one :D  Definitely beats killing zombies or playing COD for a few hours that's for sure......."
7782,"I would skip this game. Pod respawn isn't perfect somehow. It's a fun game it just felt kinda grindy and there is no real build variation. If it gets really cheap and your computer can't run anything better, Get It. It beats the pants off of a lot of other games it just feels a little lonely. Borderlands is better with friends."
7783,"Clunky combat. Feels unfinished. 

I can't recommend this."
7784,Love this game. I bought the Handsome Jack collection on My Xbox One. so I got Borderlands 2 game of the year and the pre-sequel. and recently bought Tales from the Borderlands. I hope Gearbox makes a Borderlands 3.
7785,Horribly unbalanced when playing solo.
7786,"I've never been a huge fan of any shooter games...Borderlands has definitely changed my mind. After watching my brother play Borderlands 2 with a friend, I figured I'd try out the first. And boy am I glad I did! I loved the original game story line and all of the dlcs! I can't wait to play the other games in this series. Definitely worth buying! :)"
7787,The best of the 3 borderlands games in terms of setting.
7788,Good game
7789,"Well, this game is interesting, It's really fun that's for sure, just looting all day, with like about one hundred thousand gazillion trillion guns, It my be a bit frustrating sometimes, and during the end game, you pretty much just run around not doing all that much, and world does not feel very ''alive'' I know it's a desert, but still It could've done better, But for a 2009 game, it's really amazing and you should give it a try, buy the DLC, it's really worth it IMO ^^ , I give this game... a solid 8.25/10, because nowadays, some games do the same thing but better, *cough cough* Borderlands 2"
7790,Definetly the best FPS RPG ever. Recomend for all FPS fans
7791,"I've been playing shooters since they first started making them, and I enjoyed this one as much as any."
7792,Best Game Ever (After Borderlands 2)
7793,"This is My Favorite Game of all Time. Even though its been a good 7 years the graphics haven't failed me. The art style is timeless. Even though it doesn't have as much as BL2, I think it's still the better game. No matter the time or the way I feel playing this game always makes me feel the best and when you have friends to play with it It makes the game even Better. 100% perfect game. Get it today.
Best Game Ever."
7794,"great loot hunting experience, really fun co-op with friends"
7795,boring without friends to play it with
7796,
7797,did not give me cancer 10/10  would not get cancer again
7798,...
7799,'sgood I like mordecai's bird
7800,"Had this for ages, just started to play.
In short, the UI is all kinds of messed up, not worth playing, looked good but i didnt play it for more than 20 mins 
before i gave up.shame"
7801,I like it.
7802,"Bazillion guns, crazy funny characters, an annoying little robot..... what more could you ask for?"
7803,AMAZING!!!!!
7804,"From the small bit of this game that I have played, it is marvellous. The art style works a lot better than I thought it would. The combat and controls are very fluid. I personally changed melee to Q, but that is just my preference. I'd describe this game as a good mix of Fallout and Bioshock.

Pros:
Good gameplay
Pretty world
Satisfying combat

Cons:
Textures take a second or two to load when going from area to area.

I would rate this game 9/10 from what I have played of it. That could change up or down depending on the rest of the game.

EDIT: I have played more of the game and it continues to be a joy.

I recieved this key from the Steam Group: Accidentally Reviewed. I thank them very much and encourage all to join."
7805,Shooting a rocket launching shotgun in a game that isn't broken from technical difficulties... Yes please!
7806,Fanflippingtastic
7807,"Blech. Follow quest arrow, listen to 'funny' dialogue, shoot enemies, grab loot. Ugh. 

I also played a free weekend of the sequel and felt the same. Completely rote and unimaginative PLAY that's just a shiny layer over a loot-divulging Skinner box."
7808,"[h1] I recommend this to people who don't already have the newly released ""remaster"" version, but to anyone else I would recommend staying away and buying Borderlands 3 instead [/h1]


Played it a bunch on the 360 when it came out, was fun because there wasn't any real game that topped its fps gameplay. I later found out it started my path towards liking MMO based gameplay with its progressive loot system (ie finding better gear and playing coop with friends).

Replaying now feels weird because I'm so used to other FPS's, but there's a certain nostalgia for this game when I come back to it on a rainy day. Aside from some easily solvable technical issues (due to the games age), it's all worth it though as this game can keep you hooked for hours if you like ""loot and shooters"".

Only weird stuff/negatives I can think of: 

Gameplay can be a little stale and dry at the beginning

No auto loot for money like in the second game, which makes it infinitly more tedious playing

Weird pacing around the 2nd and 3rd major boss battle (in my opinion)

No real in game dialouge or explanation for weird ghost/AI lady at the beginning"
7809,BEST GAME EVER
7810,"Come on, It's ""Borderlands"" a Classic End of World type shooter Game.
For them that don't know the game, 
I'd say Mad Max is there nearest thing I can think of right now, that's close to the Game.

I will Say this, It's Fun, Challenging with endless DLC.
"
7811,Best
7812,One of the best FPS games I have played in awile!
7813,"This is a fantastic blend of questing, outfitting, and shooting that will keep you entertained for the hours where you're actually doing something. Between missions, the land is dull and uncaptivating, the story is mediocre, and the sounds are monotonously mind-numbing. During missions, enemies of varying styles and levels, procedurally generated weapons, and an intriguing art style makes for a pretty good game.

Pros:
Had this game on xbox360, beat it with brother. Awesome.
Enjoyed it enough to pick it back up and start playing it again in singleplayer

Cons:
Bought PC, bought borderlands, began single-player mode.
Invited brother who just bought PC along for a multiplayer ride.
Now bored as hell during playthroughs of every mission and sick and tired of seeing THE SAME DAMN LANDSCAPE NO MATTER WHERE THE HELL I GO

8/10 would procedurally generate"
7814,Best game ever!!!!!
7815,"Best RPG i have ever played/owned better grind than most other games i've ever played. Has plenty of guns, plenty quests, and a load of endless posibilities to do with friends. Overall a must have!"
7816,"After competing this game the story does keep you entertained, from fighting midget psychos to fighting some weird giant slug thing it still keeps you entertained. Only problem with this was the at the end in my opinion the story fell flat and I guess you end up playing Borderlands 2 to see if that continues this. *I did not by any of the DLC for this maybe that has some to add to main story idk*"
7817,"This game took way to much time. But I finished it and I had plenty of fun with my friends, since the recommendation. I loved the DLCs more than the main game. I found the stories more interesting and diversified, not as repetetive as the primary story. Overall plenty of fun and laughs were had. :P

I would recommend buying a 4-pack when on discount, picking up some friends and logging into a voice-chat. :)"
7818,"I recommend this game for people who are looking for a whole new aspect of... RPG/FPS gameplay lets say. I haven't finished the game yet, so this is not an ""overall"" review. What was really appealing to me was the fact that in Borderlands, in order to pass missions without retrying a couple hundred times, You need to grind, but only with some aspects of your character development (by this I mean advancing into different levels with your vault hunter, grinding weapons, ect.). The game runs smoothly, with very minimal lag for even the crappiest computers. I haven't tried the DLC yet so I can't say anything on that. Its really, good. Great. Perfect, if your the type of gamer that likes FPS/RPG Styled Gameplay."
7819,So much DAMN HOT weapons!!
7820,"This game will forever be a classic, everything about it perfect."
7821,"One of the best FPS games i have ever played, GUNS, everywhere GUNS and LOOT! Absolutely amazing :D"
7822,12/11 GG ClapTRAP
7823,"Highly recommend.
Awesome frenetically paced shooter with tons of personality."
7824,"This game is both fun and humorous. I never really felt a sense of danger, just always eager to see what's next.

Collecting weapons and other loot is a big part of the game. I think I spent more time trying different weapon and gear combinations than anything else - but I loved ever minute of it."
7825,"Amazing game, so much fun, hilarious."
7826,The first of the series and by far in my opinion and many others it is the best of all the games yet I recommend buying this first if you are new to the series because it is a good opener to the game
7827,"Borderlands, not as perfected as the 2nd. Still a fun time."
7828,"This is one of the best Borderlands games there is. I played Borderlands 2 and Borderlands The Pre-sequal before I played Borderlands, and now that I am playing it, I can't stop. I 100% recommend it."
7829,"I've heard good things about this game a long time ago so i finally decided to buy it. I started playing solo and I came to like the unique graphics. I started doing missions and found that you have to read everytime you do a mission which sucks because I get lazy and skip over the reading and then have know clue what im doing and why. Not even 5 missions into the game and I already cant pass my objectives. The enemies kill me in three shots and it takes me 200 shots to kill just one. Luckly I the game keeps respawning me so after about 6 deaths I finally clear out a small group of enemies. Personally I think dying a bunch of times just to kill an enemy is pretty frusturating. But anyways I keep going through missions that way until eventually the game thinks im ready for a mega boss that one hit kills me. Im not kidding when I was I unloaded all of my ammo into this thing and only took 1/16th of his health down. After that I said fuck it im not playing this anymore.

So unless Im playing the game wrong, this game is a piece of garbage."
7830,"This game is like Farcry but with shops! Love getting new weapons, swapping, selling, using."
7831,Better than the Sequel.
7832,Loot and Shoot your way to level cap
7833,"set the bar for RPG style shooters [cough the division cough]

the art style is really neat and the game was quite humorous

i may or may not have pirated this and played the hell out of it, regardless

i enjoyed slaughtering midgets all the way thru the story

did not replay

5/10"
7834,10/10 would 69 again
7835,"Borderlands personally is a fascinating video game introducing a different world than any other game with unique elements. I will just write down the points what makes it so great.

- A wonderful, competitive, funny and unique FPS. 

- Various weapons, shields, elements give diversity to the loadoat. 

- Every coin counts if you want to have all the great stuff (In Bordelands 2 I just use guns I get from bosses, I rarely purchase weapons or other stuff from vending machines).

- The story impacted me more than the sequel.

- Coop is always so much fun with friends.

-Always an opportunity to find a challenge.

Despite my subjectivity, I rate it 10/10 because of its uniqueness and success making a colorful and hilarious shooter.

MUST TO GET"
7836,This game is fun everyone should at least try it once!!!!!
7837,"Borderlands is one of my all time favourite games, and the second one was even better, but this review is about the game that started this awesome series. 

There are tons of side quests that will keep you busy and get lots of loot to help you through the main story line, and with thousands of different gun combinations you will never run out of new loot.

The world of Borderlands is huge and at times feels never-ending, which is good because it makes all the side quests feel important and not just “another generic side quest”. There are also a number of different landscapes and types of areas that will keep the long story line interesting and have some sense of progression.

The character choices are also very interesting, with each class being very different than the rest. You can play a more tanky class, sharpshooter class, or even a guy with a deployable turret that eliminates anything in front of it (my favourite class). The skill trees that come with these classes also help shape the kind of build you want for your character. 
"
7838,i recumends
7839,"Oh man, what this game is fucking amazing.

Guns are epic as shit
Revolvers are the new snipers confirmed
DLC releases DLC
(In other words the DLC's are brilliant)
Pretty damn fun
Farming doesn't even feel like that"
7840,"the real reason is why should you get this amazing game??? because you are lame that why, if you dont wanna be lame, you should get this game... period"
7841,"The game is fun if you have a couple of friends with you.
Otherwise, im sure the semi-repetitiveness of traveling back and forth between the same 3-4 areas will steer you away.
Still good though~"
7842,"This game is better in every way that matters than it's sequel. Better, more interesting and more plentiful loot (this is a diablo clone FPS after all, loot is EVERYTHING). All of the weapon types, with the exception of the rocket launchers are more  fun to use, especially snipers, revolvers and combat rifles. You can and will get plenty of good weapons without farming the same boss 600 times. Unlike Borderlands 2 you will find yourself looking at almost every blue weapon and above to see if it might be an upgrade (as opposed to knowing for sure that it is vendor trash).

Don't be fooled by my playtime, I bought this game back when it first came out on disk, and all of the subsequent awesome DLC.

Things Borderlands 2 did better (and there aren't many)
-Graphics
-Better overall port with more options for pc
-The legendary items, for the most part are awesome. It just requires hundreds of hours to MAYBE get 1...or a good one at that.
-Endgame...BL1 doesn't exactly have one, though the BL2 endgame is a drag.

The bottom line here is that BL1 is more fun solo than BL2 is with friends.. and BL1 is far more fun with friends. 

"
7843,"I like it, despite the many problems, but I'd be hard pressed to recommend it. The atmosphere and gunplay saves it.

I hate it when someone criticizes a game for being too long, but boy golly does this game take too long to beat. By the time I've got to the 2nd DLC, I was already done with the game and had to power through it. The new enemies and drastic changes in scenery just barely managed to keep me going. It took 38 freakin' hours to clear this game and it's 3 DLC's. (Moxxi not counted.)

Probably the biggest issue is how out-of-whack the RPG systems are. The enemies feel like they stop leveling three-quarters through the main game. Also around that same point, you will rarely find loot that can replace your arsenal. My final equipment dropped at the beginning of DLC 1, for example.

Even further out of whack is the online system. This was a pretty big title for Gearbox back in the day, with a lot of online activity. Why, then, did they not bother to apply just a MODICUM of quality control, or - heck - just common goddamned sense when it comes to online mode is beyond me. See, after clearing the game, I wanted to join some of the few players still playing online. Of course, I'm way overleveled and had completed ~98% of all the missions, but I figured I'd sit back, let them do their thing and have fun by sniping from vantage points. Anyways, point is, soon as I joined, the host got spammed up with every single mission I've completed, now being irreversably marked as active on his quest log. He swore, told me what happened, then promptly kicked me.

Like why? Why and how was this a good idea? How hard is it to make video games?

On the upside, though, they ported the game over from GameSpy to Steam with success and care. So there's that, I guess."
7844,"One of the best co-op FPS games around.  Haven't had this much fun since Unreal Tournament.  This game can get a little monotonous due to the short respawn time of the creatures and bandits, but the endless combination of weapons and sneaky AI help keep the game fresh.  I eagerly await the next installation!!"
7845,Literally my favorite game ever
7846,"Borderlands is a game that you can pick up and play at any time since the game relys less on story driven exploits and more on mission based combat. That being said, the missions can get tedious at times, often making you repeat the same objectives for little to no rewards. Although it can be fun at times to blast away at everything in your path, at some point killing becomes more of a chore than anything. The difficulty curve of this game also leaves something to be desired. At no point did I feel as though the game forced me into making better tactics. Its a fun romp, but you won't get too attached to the game in the end."
7847,"I went into this game late, after playing both of its sequels and enjoying them both. I had virtually no one tell me to bother with the first game, since 2 was ""practically the same game but with better features."" Well I'll tell you this much; Borderlands has become my favourite game in the series. It is far funnier and wittier than its successors, and gave me far more free reign over exploration of the world. I also thought that this game while a little slow to start, has way better pacing or at the very least way less pacing issues than with the later games. And after countless hours of having your butt whooped, you can manage to feel like a proper Badass towards the end of the game, which i think adds a nice contrasting layer of depth to the game. 
Overall pretty damn fun game, not without its issues though. 8/10"
7848,"Everything people told me about what makes Borderlands so amazing were always completly un-appealing to me, I also was not really a fan of the graphics, but while I was playing the game the graphics really fit how the game plays and are quite enjoyable. The game is a lot of fun just to mess around and do whatever you want.

The story(s) in the game are enjoyable enough (though a lot of people only like playing the game with other people so keep that in mind) but I did enjoy the game with or without people to play with.

A lot of friends kept reccomending that I play it, and because I never saw anything appealing from it I just said meh to it always... The game however went into a Humble Bundle for a good price so I just decided why not, and I really enjoyed it. 

It has pleanty of funny moments that are enjoyable and so far I've been enjoying the series."
7849,i liked the part when you opened a chest and there were guns in it
7850,Great game to the start of an awesome series. 8/10
7851,"For a negative review, I”m going to keep it light because this game is very important. It's important for one reason and one reason only.

It may have been the first, not to mention the foundation for the second game Borderlands 2 but shoot...even as FPSes go...this didn't take off very well imho.

Let me explain, if I can make head shots all day at 50 yards and greater in many other games how come I'm still missing head shots at less that distance with sniper rifles that claim to have +95% accuracy IN THIS GAME?!

Oh that's not nearly as unbelievable as being unable to score more than 3 head shots per a MAGAZINE with SMGs and Assault rifles at 10 yards or less.
Seriously...I don't know if that was a programming calculation error or if the dam hitboxes for all of the enemies heads are borked.

Worse than this the guns' stats and levels scale very slowly throughout the game. I was still finding level 3 and starting weapons when I was past level 20 but that could be my memory failing me in regards to what locations I was finding gun lockers in.

The vehicles handle like crap and get stuck in the most awkward of spots.

The characters are not funny, just blatantly annoying. Heck their personalities don't even fit the way they behave in Borderlands 2. (Roland not only doesn't even sound close to that but doesn't even say those kind of things. Sheesh.) 

Some of the early monsters, namely adult skags, have so much armor covering them in the front that point blank shotguns can't even get damage out of them and there's almost not a reliable way of getting behind them half of the time.

Goal navigation is painful and it is not explained that multiple parts for a fetch quest are not labeled on the map. The parts are just labeled with one diamond in the middle of the general area. It's more misleading than anything.

The game itself isn't even remotely humorous to begin with. Most of the quests are very plain and the npcs don't say a lot of entertaining dialog. The psychos are slightly funny but they say waaaaay better stuff in Borderlands 2. I think Tannis' audio logs were the only real enjoyable giggle I got out of this game. The irony is I actually hated her in BL2 because she was more mock and less professional with her detailed train of thought.

Despite nearly every aspect of this game having a tag of “barely functional” and “lacking in good flavor” there's still that one important thing I didn't get to mention.

Gearbox learned what they did wrong...and they fixed it.

And thus...from the ashes of this game came Borderlands 2. 

You can play this if you want but you might want to play Borderlands 2 first so you can enjoy this franchise for what it is and save this for when you just want to see what happened...but heck...most of that is explained in Borderlands 2 anyway. You're not really missing a lot here."
7852,Love love love this game. There are some minor things like clipping that get in the way but overall this game is a must play. My partner and I always turn to this game when we just want to play something fun and time consuming.
7853,amo morire  e perdere tutti i soldi :)
7854,"Not as good as BL2, but still worth a play if you're a fan of the 2nd installment"
7855,Not even sure my review is needed here.
7856,how can i play this on ubuntu
7857,"I played this high as shit for almost 2 weeks, then got sober and was like ""wtf am I even doing""

Would recommend"
7858,"For me, this is best game ever made. Thx for it ^^
Borderlands 2 is awesome, but not better than Borderlands 1."
7859,"Good game (better than RAGE) so funny better when you but GOTY edition but it is good without it (no it isent) 
all i like is the guns the loot and everything of course. buy it and you will play it fr hours good luck playing through the whole storyline. 
the main thing is that there is 4 playalbe caricters and you have to choose one they are called ""Vault Hunters"" they are finding something named the ""Vault Key"". they have spicial abilities and have a preferred wepon. the main thing you should buy is the GOTY borderlands and borderlands 2 good luck handleing the crappye yet chessey jokes.
loved it"
7860,"As much as I wanted to enjoy this game there were far too many things that bugged me. First of all the gunplay. It is horrible. The bullet speed on all weapons is far too slow and you have to lead targets a lot even if they are only 20m away from you. This applies to enemies as well so you can just strave a bit and they almost never hit you. Weapons are also too strong and make the fights too easy and boring. I found a ridiculously powerful rifle pretty early in the game (around level 10) and was able to kill almost every enemy with one single burst (it was a 3x burst weapon), even after level 35+. The second major flaw is the story. It develops very slowly and is far from interesting. You can do many sidequests which is good, but most of them are just ""kill 10 of that"" or ""pick up 15 of this"". The maps are also fairly huge and you can even drive around in a car-like thingy and shoot enemies with a mounted gun. Lack of control options is another flaw that annoyed me (you can't disable crouch toggle for example). In the end the flaws made me drop Borderlands after 20ish hours (the number in Steam is wrong, I played offline most of the time) and I can't recommend it."
7861,"Fun, easy to handle, nervous gameplay, a big variety of gear, weapons, shields, elemental effects and several ways to use them, awesome bossfights, a lot of humor. Sometimes in order to defeat the next area you'll have to grind a few levels, but that's not a big deal, even grinding levels is fun in this game!! 9/10"
7862,"Awesome game, is there anybody to play with?"
7863,"If you are going to buy and play this game be ready to spend money and time on the other games from the franchise and all the DLCs etc. , just by the way."
7864,"Awsome game, fun and colorfull, great story and memorable loveable characters. One of the best first person shooters I have ever played."
7865,"very well done, probably the best game I've ever played"
7866,good game 5/5
7867,good game!
7868,pandora is sort of like a weird cross between space australia and space texas everything wants to kill you and you have enough guns to kill them right back
7869,"Not as good as the second one, but still a pretty dang good game."
7870,one of my favorite games to play with others.
7871,"Play it!
Just play it!

Don't let your dreams be dreams.
Yesterday you said tomorrow.
So just play it.
Make your dreams come true.
Just play it.

Some people dream of success.
While you're gonna wake up and work hard at it.
Nothing is impossible.

You should get to the point.
Where anyone else would quit.
And you're not going to stop there.
No, what are you waiting for?

Play it!
Just play it!
Yes you can!
Just play it!
If you're tired of starting over.
Stop giving up!"
7872,Fun game. Like the add ons
7873,"It is not something you are going to find out in the first 30 or 40 minutes of playing, but this is one of the best games ever.

There is no better way to merge a FPS with a RPG game. It's simply the best of both worlds and the creators sure did it right.

It has to be considered very time consuming, but if you want to burn your time like you'll live forever, this is the game for you.

The side missions are so extensive it's pretty hard to even finish 100% and even if you do, you still have playthrough 2 to get bigger enemies and better loot.

Also, the comedy factor adds a great value to the mix, as they also pulled that one off.

100 out of 10 would recommend."
7874,"Borderlands is a classic. But, it has many problems that make this game not worth replaying or continuing. This game has very tedious, boring gameplay, where the core of the game is get new guns kill more enemies. The story is very repetitive, most of the story consisting of go here and fetch me this or kill these guys. Playing co op is very fun, but this game is honestly a game I do not enjoy replaying at points and I find it hard to go back to after a time away from it. If you are playing it for your first time, you may enjoy it, but I personally did not love it in my first playthrough. But the classic nostalgia and gameplay on co op makes me recommend it but keep in mind these problems."
7875,"straight up classic.  i originally had it on x360 but the point is , is that is great.
9/11"
7876,
7877,"Borderlands -PC-

Borderlands is a well constructed hybrid of a game mixing first person shooter and role playing elements. It features, and encourages up to a 4 player coop through the whole game which can make for some fun times with friends. So, if you’ve got another friend or two or three who are up for an adventure in a post apocalyptic world that’ll last around 20 hours, then you’re in luck. If you decide to play it by yourself it’s still pretty fun, but you’re kinda missing the point.

There are so many first person shooter games out on the market, and at times it's difficult to see at first glace what sets each one apart. What makes Borderlands so unique is that it’s really just a role playing game at heart but it makes itself look like a conventional shooter.  Really, Borderlands is probably set up more closely to games like Warcraft Worlds and Fallout 3. For example you’ll level up a character, perform quests traveling from city to city, and chose you’re combat  roll (damage dealer, tank, healer, etc) through allocating points in a talent tree. So now you know what you’re getting into.

The combat in Borderlands was not my favorite, but I still had quite a bit of fun with it. You’ll play the whole game from a first person perspective with you’re gun in hand. But since Borderlands is set up an an RPG and also a FPS, it can be somewhat deceiving. Let me explain, usually in FPS games, you can take down any enemy with well placed shots. The potency of you’re shot depends on the weapon you’re using and the strategic placement of your bullet. In Borderlands, it’s really an RPG, so if say you’re character is level 5 and you’re shooting a level 10 monster you simply can’t beat it regardless of firepower. You’ll need to go out and shoot some lesser monsters until you are a high enough level. I didn’t find this too off putting because the game does a good job at setting the right pace for you to be on par with the enemies you’re up against.

Now onto the coop, this is where Borderlands can really shine, but it can also provide some serious frustration.  Borderlands lets 4 people play at the same time. One player hosts a game while the others join in. The only downfall to this, is that only host’s quests can be completed. So for example if you are already done with a series of quests and want to move on with you’re friend, if he is hosting then you’re have to do them again, but if you’re hosting then you’re friend won’t get credit for any of the quests you do cause he’s behind you. So syncing up quest lines can be frustrating. Also of note, If you’re in a party the monsters will be the same level as the highest member of your party. So if 3 of you are level 10 but you have a level 18 in your party that means that all the monsters will be level 18 and you won’t even be able to damage them.

Borderlands was released in late 2009, but it took me around a year and a half to beat the game because I was always trying to get 3 other people to play with me. When we finally got out schedules together to play it was great, but I couldn’t play the game by myself in fear of leveling up higher than them, or not having the same quests. In the end I beat the last half of the game by myself.

Moving on. Borderlands is set in a post apocalyptic world. The whole world is barren with little life, the towns are pieced together junk yards, and many areas are infested with gigantic insects, mutants, and warring factions. It is made known the your character right at the beginning that you are chosen to serve a great purpose and you must fulfill an important quest. Funny thing is that as you play the game you’ll find that the significance of this important quest gets lesser and lesser until finally *spoiler* you beat the game and realize how meaningless the main quest-line really was. Cause you’ll beat the end guy and there’s no ending or resolution.

The game progresses through quests. Each city will have kind of a “quest hub” where you’ll pick up a quest then you’re off to fulfill it. Most quests are standard to what you’ll find in Warcraft Worlds like going and killing x number of boars or going out to location x and collecting lost parts.

The characters in each city and the graphical style really give the game personally. just like how the game’s cover you’ll see a man shooting himself in the head, Borderlands is gritty, violent, and fun. Characters never really take themselves seriously and have a good sense of humor. The majority of the characters have strong over the top hill billy accents and use red neck phrases. Borderlands has a cell shaded graphical style but everything in the end just looks dead and dirty, just like they wanted it to look.

This is the first game I’ve played in this kind of genre and I really made an attempt to play with friends. I found this attempt to be nearly impossible on the PC. Perhaps in another life if I had been much younger with neighborhood friends, we could have played system link on our Xboxes. But I doubt that we would have had the hardware, and the game is pretty crude so I doubt my parents would have let me play it. Anyway, I like Borderlands and it has quite a bit to offer to fans of RPGs and FPS gamers.
Written Nov 2011 for website allgamesplayed given a 4 out of 5"
7878,"Quick question: Why was this game so acclaimed?

The game goes like this:
1. Go to NPC to get a quest. You'll find that they (excluding enemies) are the only people in this otherwise dead world.
2. Go to X location and do the thing that the NPC told you to do.
3. Return for reward.
4. Repeat.

Every conversation I've had with friends who LOVED this game (main reason I finally bought it) would go like this:

Friend: This last quest I ended up with an awesome shotgun that shoots fire (or something.)
Me: How did you get it?
Friend: There was a creature/enemy that can drop it.
Me: So you grind for it like WoW?
Friend: *Sneer* this isn't WoW, you don't grind for hours to get weapons.
Me: How long had you played before the weapon dropped?
Friend: Like 3-4 hours, it was awesome.

Borderlands strikes me as a game for people who want to play MMORPGS but hate fantasy and look down on other people for playing WoW. They've got guns instead of swords and bug/mutant things instead of dragons and monsters. They have sexual innuendos like Clap Trap...tee...hee. This isn't some froofy nerdy virgin WoW MMO. This is a man's man MMO...with guns and grime and boobies and naughty language. The entire game, jokes, dialogue, graphics and weapons come off as a game that is trying so hard to be ""cool and edgy"".

I only played for 6 hours, started to nod off and quit. I haven't been back since. Pick up Borderlands if you're looking for a sleep aid."
7879,its no half bad m9
7880,"I Don't have it, but i like it"
7881,"Great game, great story.  I dont think any of the other borderlands were as good as the first."
7882,Tons of guns + friends = hecka fun!
7883,"I played that game already many games ago.
However, I could never finish it in Singleplayer because it got quite fast boring.

Now I played the whole game including the DLCs in coop though and I have to say that I actually enjoyed it.
It makes a lot of fun with a friend. Well, as long as you dont fight about the loot, hah. Since we had different characters this wasnt as much of a deal because mostly we were interested into different weapons and items.

But what is this game even about?
Well, there is a treasure in a so called vault. You are the one who should find out about it and uncover its secrets. You are helped by a woman which stays totally secret the whole game. You dont even know who she is but she is following your actions the whole game. Until you actually find the vault. Thats more or less the story. Yeah, not that special.

The game is a open world FPS. Open world more or less. I cant tell of many corridor levels luckily. I actually enjoyed the map design. The game also has some small RPG elements. Not that many though. Mostly its about killing enemies with a very big variety of weapons to get XP, items, loot. You can also use skills to do so. Like using a eagle to kill your enemies with the hunter class. There are also other classes like siren with its phasewalk skill. You always get levels with skillpoints which you can put into a skill improvement like more damage with shotguns or whatever. There is also a big amount of missions you can do like main story missions or many side missions. Those give items and XP too. The enemies usually have a level which you should have too, to be able to mess with them. Partly the enemies seem to scale with the player but im not entirely sure about that. You always should try to do side missions for XP. Those missions can be in the whole world but usually you are in a specific area for a certain time. You can also use a teleporter or cars to move in the game. The cars also have guns.

The Engine is the Unreal Engine 3 which had, for its time, nice graphics. Its cell shading graphic though. Everything looks like in a comic if you dont know what cell shading means. There is a somewhat big amount of graphic options you can select in the game. Definitely a solid PC port which doesnt really miss much beside of Anti Aliasing or Vsync. Vsync is activateable through a simple config edit. Anti Aliasing is quite a mess with Unreal Engine 3 games. But its not like you need it. Aliasing is not that bad with the game in my opinion. Might be because of the cell graphic.

The game recently got updated with Steamworks which is really cool! Multiplayer never worked that well before with Gamespy. Also playing in coop is much fun! Thanks to the devs for the continued support after many years.

Positives:
- Many different weapons with unique statistics
- Around 40 hours playtime with DLCs, without somewhat like 30
- Good multiplayer coop action
- Interesting comic look graphic
- Interesting characters
- Nice soundtrack
- Good DLCs with nice content
- Good PC Port
- Not possible to reach max level and a so called ""Secret Final Boss"" with only one playthrough, good replayable!

Negative:
- Might be boring in Singleplayer
- Sometimes, especially in coop, enemies take way too many hits in my opinion, its like you have to pump like 50 shots of a shotgun into a somewhat common enemy. Im not talking about bosses. And also I talk about enemy with the same level as the player. This is kinda annoying and kinda breaks the fun. Its not that often though.
- I dont know why but one DLC got kinda messed up because in it you cant teleport and mostly have to use the car to move around. This traveling takes quite some time and you often have to do it. And sometimes you are even stopped by baricades with hordes of enemies which respawn. This was really annoying...

I personally can recommend this game. Its really fun and has a nice design and its kinda addicting. However, I personally could only fully enjoy it in coop for some reason. The singleplayer might be a bit boring for some folks.

I think I will give that game a solid 8/10 rating.
If you like good coop games, this is a must buy. Singleplayer gamers might be interested too."

7887,Good
7888,all i need to say is CLAPTRAP SHUT THE HELL UP besides that great game
7889,"Played this back when it came out for the PS3. Rebought it on Steam just to relive the glory days. This is a great game that still stands out even today. I personally recommend this over Borderlands 2 or the Pre-sequel.

9/10"
7890,best co-op game I have ever played ever and I love it and the sequals very dear
7891,How the hell do I have 47-hours of gameplay in this game?
7892,"I have to say I don't understand what the hype was about.
This is one of the most boring games I've played.

The gameplay amounts to:
[olist]
[*] Kill ?/? of this enemy.
[*] Collect/activate ?/? of this thing.
[*] Kill this boss.
[*] Rare gun drop? Compare its numbers to your equipped gun's numbers. Sell gun with lower numbers.
[/olist]
 
There has been nothing in the 6 hours I've played that has been remotely innovative. It is the exact same model done by any mmorpg, but within a much smaller world. And unlike most mmorpg's there has so far been no significant change in the scenery. Just dull brown, sand, dust, more brown, more sand.

The enemy AI is pretty lack luster and there have been minor bugs and glitches on a pretty regular basis.

Finally I've been waiting for the humor that everyone talked about, but so far I only see a game that tries to be funny and misses the mark either in comedic timing, bad voice acting, or character conception. The last one I'm looking at you Clap-Trap. Someone should have told Gear Box there is no such thing as a character that is so obnoxious they somehow become funny."
7893,This is one of my most favorite games i ove it so much
7894,I give it a 10/10 because the game itself is a 15/10 but the fact that you have to watch the intro everytime you make a new character subtracts 5 points.
7895,fun and good for  my youtube
7896,"08-Feb-2016 : Finished main story
Equipment : MSI GT80-2QE Notebook

REVIEW : 
The first 10 mins of gameplay, I thought this game is just not good. Weird graphic style, slow pacing... but ClapTrap is so funny that I kept playing. And next thing you know, I finished the game in 5 days (approx 35H gameplay). The story is standard, but the characters are memorable. The RPG element also make it more addictive. 

CONCLUSION :
Recommended on sale price."
7897,pretty good game keep all
7898,never seen this game never played this game 10/10

7901,Yes!
7902,"1)Found a cliff
2)Jumped from that cliff
3)Realized that this is not Borderlands 2
4)Died because fall damage

10/10 would die because of fall damage again"

7904,cool game 10 autta 10
7905,"Like Skyrim, with guns!"
7906,Really love the story play in this game =D i have reccomended it to several people
7907,"Play with a friend or partner. Fun to fight over loot and not save your friends, or save them! Blow stuff up and waste your time getting lost in the loot. Can get boring. I like this one better than the second!"
7908,"this game has a good story but 
-enemies are harmless ( or their both harmless and good but when their harmless theres like 4-6 people easy to kill, when their good its 10-13 much harder)
-you are almost not close to die if youre in conflict with enemies 
-zombies has like 1000000 health
my tips don't buy this shit!!!"
7909,"While the game's sequel is much more fun (and has much more players; though that's because nobody plays it via legal means), this is a great start for the franchise. I don't recommend buying the bundle with this and BL2, though, since the GOTY edition has more value and is cheaper; instead, buy this game on sale."
7910,Very shoot to loot and kill. Boom headshot
7911,"Please send help! I can't stop playing, its in my dreams both during the day and night, and my thist for dat organge is ever present and unrelenting."
7912,good game i had this on xbox 360 and i loved it then and still love it better then boredlands 2 because it a much longer game if your going to buy this game do it good because it very very good game
7913,"bretty gud :ddddd

6~7/10"
7914,love it get this game or DIE
7915,"One Word

LOOT!!!!!"
7916,"A great game, lots of guns and fun to be had."
7917,"It's pretty much Diablo - but with guns, in first person, and in the desert.

Nearly infinite, procedurally-generated guns.  The desert stayes the same, though - and it's a little boring.

A loot-driven FPS with a might-as-well-not-exist storyline and a charming character or two - and quite a few cringy ones.

The gunplay is decent enough, but it's really about the loot and the STAAAATS - variation in minutia and ad-nauseum.

Terrible screen-tearing without something like D3DOverrider.

It's all about finding that next perfect gun.  As fun as gambling!

If the idea of this game sounds good to you, maybe catch it on sale - there's plenty of fun to be had.  The second game is arguably better in every single way - and in some ways, a LOT better - but there's a certain charm that didn't carry over in all the improved production values and polish the second game enjoyed.  The guns also make slightly more sense in the game - as absurd an cartoon-y as they are.

7/10 would probably pew-pew again"
7918,"I personally dislike this game, it's far too cartoon-y for my liking and just seems like a major cliche. Despite this, however, it does have a lot of potential and seems like the type of game many people would enjoy."
7919,"I'm not normally a fan of shooters, But the combo of a Shooter/RPG was quite unique and enjoyable. 8/10 Would recommend."
7920,"I held off on this game due to its cartoonish graphics. I finally bought it after looking for good coop games to play with friends. This game has been my favorite coop game so far. It's like Diablo for shooters. We're always hunting for the next best item. The missions are numerous and fun, and it never seems to get old. Will definitely move on to Borderlands 2 when I beat this game."
7921,A great start to the series. This game is what makes the fram work for all the BL games that have came and that are coming.
7922,7/10
7923,"Got the Game of the year edition, and it refuses to work. Waste of money and it is rather upsetting. Keeps giving me a error that the exe or something isnt working...i mean honestly What the hell guys fix your freaking products with patches ect if you are going to put it on special to have people buy it."
7924,"personally i dont like fast run fps games like serious sam, quake etc. .but this one is epic! absolutelly worth every penny i spent!"
7925,"WAY cool!  Love this game, i think i've logged like a thousand hours on it.  It's kinda cartoony like TF2, the environments are very rich.  There is a neat coop mode like portal 2.  I especially like the guns, there's literally like a billion different guns to find and try out.  I'd say it's every bit as fun as HL2"
7926,"This is one of the best game I've ever played together with its sequel. It gives you insight of how a ""vault hunter"" works. The gameplay itself and its leveling mechanism makes it stand out against other games. If you feel bored playing the missions by yourself, you could call on you friends to give you a helping hand. Similar to Left 4 dead."
7927,"I have a lot more hours logged on this then it says because I also beat it on PS3. There is something delightfully simple about the first Borderlands. There is almost no plot other than get better guns to kill things to get better guns. And that's what is so great about it. The world, just works. The NPCs have their own flavor and keep the world livable. It's just nice."
7928,dope.
7929,"gr8 game, dlc's even better
"
7930,best out of all of them.
7931,"One of the best coop/single player shooters ever..  wonderful mechanics, loot galore.. tough bosses.. and general mayhem.. 

And the difficulty and number of enemies increases as the number of friends increases.. definitely NOT to be missed."
7932,"Great game that I had a lot of fun with. Nice combination of RPG and FPS elements, including leveling, a skill tree, classes, random item drops, etc. A light-hearted spirit full of dark humor give the game a distinctive personality that differentiate it from its peers."
7933,This game was FUCKING AWSOME. I put over 3 days worth of gameplay into this game and it was well worth it. Hoping for a Borderlands 3.
7934,Are you ready to sink 100+ hours into this game? Because you will. And it will be awesome! ;)
7935,"Difficult, especially if you're as bad at FPS as I am but still enjoyable and with decent RPG elements via the skills the different characters have."
7936,"Cliff Notes: If you're purchasing for story to prepare to play borderlands 2, skip it and watch a summary youtube video.

If you like BL2 then you will probably like this. However, if you have BL2 there really is no compelling reason to play this lol. I purchased BL2 and BL1 together on a weekend sale. I did this solely for the fact I wanted to experience the full story. I didn't realize the BL1 ""story"" was crap.

Gameplay is pretty good - Feels dead compared to BL2 (I realize that is an unfair comparison). Solo play is boring, make sure you join co-op whenever possible.
"
7937,"ok i have played this game and win this game ady,story are good other are good but!!!! there something turn me off directly and i delete this game instead,THE FKING DRIFTER(SPIDER) IN T-bone JUNCTION DLC ARE FKING HELL TURN OFF,HELL FK IT LIKE I MASTURBATE AND SUDDENLY MY PORN SHOW UP SHIT,VOMIT OR STUFF OMG TURN ME OFF DIRECTLY FK BUT YEAH OTHER DLC STILL GOOD and it still have very part of the fun"
7938,"One of the best games I have played in my life.

This game is the perfect combination between humour, action, tactics and open world. The animation style was unique for its time and is pretty well done. The missions are fun, you can do whatever you want in the terms of killing enemies, complete quest and driving around. The jokes, references and speeches of enemies made my day every time I played. I also loved the fake brands of guns that were put in the game, each with their own unique abilities.
The story is great and I loved every main mission of it. 

The boss battles are fair and challenging, the levelling system organized and the overall length of the game is really good. You can spend hours on this game.

Every DLC released for this game is amazing! Total new experiences in different settings. This DLC’s are the prime example on how to make and sell them instead of selling pieces of incomplete game later on. 

Worth every dollar/euro. Go for the Game of the Year edition for all the DLC."
7939,Very fun shooter. Great for when you want to kill stuff. If you like rpgs and fps games get this.
7940,"A pretty decent game but it, in my opinion, serves as a very good prelude to its sequel.
I prefer Borderlands 2 over this game, I also bought Borderlands 2 before this one but eventually decided that I wanted to check this one out as well.
I can clearly see that Gearbox looked at what was missing in this game or what this game had that it shouldn't have and they did something with it for the sequel. Like the amount of Claptraps, you'll know what I mean. You all will know..."
7941,"AMAZING ever wanted to taze someone until their skull, eyeballs, and brain explode. Yes its amazing."
7942,"Borderlands is a fun and hilarious action shooter with customization elements of RPG. Borderlands comes with beautiful cel-shaded graphics that would make you feel weird at first but don't let it fools you. This game offers several kinds of violence that fit perfectly with its visual. You can choose from 4 characters with different classes, abilities and play-styles. Even though each character has fixed set of active and passive skills, various mods and weapons with distinct attributes help making diversity. With just assault rifles, you can be a lousy gunner by using full automatic rifle with high rate of fire but low accuracy or be a sharpshooter by using accurate rifle with burst shot. Weapons can have one of the four elemental effects as well. The setting and story are quite unique and interesting as your character is a hunter who is looking for the high tech alien vault on a planet named Pandora. Furthermore, there are a lot of hilarious jokes and parodic references to other games and movies throughout the game. Borderlands is an great mixture of challenging action shooter and parody that would make you laugh (or smile) after a serious combat."
7943,"Just confirming that Borderlands works on my pc with windows 10.

Plays very well, graphics look dated but as it was going cheap, its good enough for me.

My graphic card is an AMD radeon R7 200 series 1.98gb in case anyone is interested."
7944,"So many guns
I have hundreds of guns
I love my guns

(Also good gameplay and story wow I love it)"
7945,"I got this game when it came out and loved it, i saw it was on sale and have it for PC now. Still one of the greatest games i have played and recommend it to anyone who hasnt played it!"
7946,"One of the best video games ever! ""Borderlands"" is a first person post apocalyptic action RPG with really cool level design and humorous approach.

PROS:
- amazing comic book style graphics
- awesome level design and post-apocalyptic atmosphere
- character leveling and skills
- dark humor
- a lot of guns to choose from
- interesting story
- Claptraps (small cynical robot bastards)
- really, really addictive
- cool bosses (some of them challenging)

MEH:
- you don't notice the music most of the time, nothing special

CONS:
- none :)

Side notes: I played the whole game in single player and haven't played any of the Borderlands series before.

GAMEPLAY 10/10
GRAPHICS 10/10
AUDIO 7/10
STORY 9/10"
7947,"Even though Borderlands 2 has a far superior story, way more interesting characters, a better loot system, and overall probably more replayability, something makes me like Borderlands 1 better. I think it has something to do with the feel of the guns and the more rewarding feel of getting new guns.

The only problem i have with this game is the stupid FOV lock they put on it. I think the default is 60? This is fixable with the Ultimate Borderlands Mod I found on the Nexus. It enables the console for this game and you can set it there(Along with other things like toggling viewpoints.)"
7948,this game is a must. Its one of the best game i ever played.
7949,sell shadeen
7950,"I only have one thing to say about this game, ""Guns, guns and more guns!"""
7951,I mean who doesnt love shooting
7952,best borderlands game great original IP
7953,"One of the best games I've played. I had the non-steam version until Game Spy closed down so they gave me the steam version for free. Good single player/multiplayer gameplay that reminds you of the good old days of gaming. Simple shoot and loot, what more can you ask for?
Moderately good graphics for its time
Exciting gameplay
Humorous story line

7954,"This game makes me so happy. 

"
7955,10/10 would let friends steal my guns again.
7956,Really boring in singleplayer.
7957,"One of the best games I've ever played. This is the game that starts one of the best series of video games. And though this game isn't the series' pinnacle, it is definitely one of the best in there.

Pros:
Amazing humor
Creative gameplay
TONS of randomly generated guns
Unique characters with skill trees
Fun multiplayer
Awesome DLC's
Challenging bosses
Interesting plot

Cons:
2009 graphics (which is expected since it's a 2009 game)
Quite a few fetch quests (though not always plot quests)
Repetitive dialogue (I know, the rakks got Jess)

But I definitely recommend this game. The negative reviews were mainly from people going from Borderlands 2 to Borderlands 1, so you can assume that going from a new game to an older game would make you feel that the older one stinks, right? And if you buy the game, you should try to wait until Game of the Year edition goes on sale, because the DLC missions are really fun and usually adjust to your character level. Happy Vault hunting!"
7958,Dancin' Robot Great
7959,I love the pc version of boderlands way better than any other gaming system. I think I am offically a pc gamer lol
7960,Lots of tits

7962,"i love it
"
7963,"One of the games I enjoyed the most, cartoonish and funny in it's own way, the gameplay, storyline and specific game mechanics made me spend endless hours in Pandora. I heard alot about Borderlands 2, but I'm trying to get the most out of Borderlands before I move to the second game. Highly recommended."
7964,One of the best fps rpg i ever played!
7965,"I came in on the Borderlands 2 hype train and I was a bit worried the original would have all kinds of rough edges because not only was it older but it was the first in a new IP. Not at bit of it: if you love BL2 you'll have fun with BL1. I'm astounded at all the things they got right, first time. Beautiful art style, lots of fun weapons, it's all there. I'd even say it's got a better UI, it's better to solo and some environments feel more expansive and more detailed.

The only thing missing is a story: it's very light on characters and story compared to 2."
7966,"This is one of my favorite games of all time
"
7967,"This game is like sex - it's waay more fun with other people!
On your own it gets boring after some time."
7968,"Fun fun fun, especially with a friend."
7969,Best gamer ever played <3 love so much Borderlands franchise!
7970,Awesome game to play
7971,Tis a pretty fun time
7972,the  graphic is not good bot it gamplay is ep
7973,"I honestly don't think this game needs an introduction, but in case you live on a rock somewhere - this game has everything: classes, skills, guns, knifes, guns with knifes, epic bosses (ehm Crawmerax ehm), silly NPCs and a whole lot of ground to cover and looting to do.

One of the best co-op experiences out there."
7974,The first in the Iconic Borderlands series. A ton of fun.
7975,"The game really hooks you, just cannot stop playing it! As the enemies start to get stronger and more difficult you find better weapons and upgrades, just a perfect level of difficult to make you addictive. The story is a bit weak though, if they had added some cut scenes and a bit of more story action would make it perfect.
The S3D is also ok, but does not impress much."
7976,"[b]Mean Mr. Mustard's short Borderlands review[/b]

 1) Essential - buy it NOW

Worth revisiting? No

Best part – Fun enemy design
Worst part – Having to grind levels on the uninteresting side quests with lifeless-feeling guns, to get to a high enough level to attempt the equally uninteresting main quest"
7977,"Borderlands is a loot gathering, action adventure which will task you with killing hordes of enemys in order to achieve your goal, an amazing game none-the-less, the side missions are just as fun and engaging as the story missions. Although Borderlands is an amazing experience on its own, the premier experience is had when playing with friends."

7982,Should be played with DLC. Can get repetitive when playing through it in NG+ but otherwise a pretty good game overall. Borderlands 2 is way better however.
7983,"The game is pretty fun, plenty of loot like constant supply of money,weapons, and ammo lying around for you to pick up.
Theres also cool vehicles and characters with different abilities. The ending of the game was kinda not what expected but whatever. The game also gets alot harder once you go into playthrough 2 but you also get stronger weapons. The game gets pretty difficult so im going to move to BoderLands 2 now(yea ik im such a noob) and also because this game came out a long time ago."
7984,Just play it
7985,"Borderlands is one of my all time top games. It's hard to remember life before BL came to be because it dramatically changed what I look for in a shooter. I simply can't enjoy certain types of games anymore due to how Borderlands screwed me up.

With varied classes, dynamically generated loot, enjoyable story/characters/dialog, and some of the best gunplay around, Borderlands deserves its spot as a (relatively) modern classic."
7986,"Much more weapon balance than pretty much all other FPS games, good gameplay even if the graphics are dated, still funny, launchers are worth using (unlike in BL2/TPS), revolvers are a thing, and more guns than any other Borderlands game. Seriously. Over double the amount of possible guns in BL2."
7987,"The vedio is not working correct, weapons and vegitation flicker and you can shoot the bad guys point blank a hundred times and they still don't die. Getting fed up with this one."
7988, it doesn't get boring unless you are out of missions. damn guess i'm gonna purchase some dlc
7989,This game is super good 10/10
7990,"Not bad game, like the others but..

On a start it's kinda hard so you have to play other quests and not the main. But the story is very good =)"
7991,S'good
7992,Still looks and plays great.
7993,"It's just bloody fun!
"
7994,"10/10, Best robot repairing simulator"
7995,"THIS GAME STANDS OUT. Hilarious 1st Person Shooter. One of the few that gives you a skill tree for your character. Excellent gameplay, weapon choices, characters, missions, and coop. An easy favorite for 1st Person Shooter fans. GET IT!! Oh, get the DLC too, if you enjoy the game the DLC's are definitely worth it."
7996,"An epic adventure on the mysterious planet of Pandora! Great game experience, cool weapons and exciting missions!

8.5/10"
7997,love this game its an old game now but a good one and up to 4 player coop is well worth a shot for anyone
7998,"The ending was BS, yes. This one is a real see-for-yourself kind of deal, not everyone is going to like borderlands but you can see the devs really tried. I recommend jumping straight into 2 if you're new to the franchise."
7999,"Borderlands is Phantasy Star Online with guns. Or Maybe Diablo with guns. Okay, Phantasy Star Online had guns too, but it wasn't an FPS. It's not a very plot-heavy game though everything is driven by quests, but the real driving force behind the game is the guns and how stats come into play. Classes feel very specialist in Borderlands, and you'll find yourself grinding a lot trying to get the perfect gun, and that depends a lot on your playstyle as well - some prefer machine guns, some prefer revolvers. It's very satisfying when you're able to get through an area you've repeatedly died in!

On the downside, there's a lot of backtracking and long walks, and by the end of the game, everything feels a bit samey. But everything seems so well balanced that it's easy to be drawn in.

Personally I prefer this over Borderlands 2 as it's more gameplay, less outdated memes - not to mention the gameplay is a lot more robust and the character classes feel better - though it has to be said Borderlands is the more varied game of the two, as the maps are more interesting and there is more to do outside of combat. If you want good, soliid gameplay BL1 is for you, but if you want story or depth try BL2."
8000,Excellent. A home for all FPS/ RPG loot ninjas. Only wish 3rd person view was built in.
8001,"I know this and Borderlands 2 are extremely popular games. But I simply could not get into them. The cell shading graphics combined to create a visual illusion that confused me. I wanted to take it seriously, but it felt like a corny joke. I had to put it down."
8002,"This is a very good classic shooter. It's fun in singleplayer, even funnier in multiplayer. You will encounter a bazillion of guns, lots of cheesy jokes and enough enemies to kill to make it fun.

Let's maybe take a look at DLCs available:
- The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned - nice plot and overall esthetics, but has a lot of backtracking and may be boring after a while
- Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot - if you play singleplayer - forget about it. If you plat multi - go for it, it's fun
- The Secret Armory of General Knoxx - quite big DLC where you'll travel by car a lot. I think that this is the most boring DLC of all, because you basically go here and there riding quite slow vehicle with little exploration of stages in which you walk by feet
- Claptrap's Robot Revolution - not that big DLC where you need to uncover why Claptrap Robots revolved. Quite short and fun

Overall this game is a really classic game that started all of the Borderlands franchise. It's really fun if you like cartoony shooters with randomly generated weapons. Just beware that it doesn't have any meaningful plot - there is some really basic storyline about trying to uncover some alien vault but this is only a background for shooting all of the bad guys and aliens."
8003,very good game :)
8004,"It's a game I love for a few hours then get very, very tired of very, very quickly.

I've beaten the game on XBox360 playing with friends and even bought the sequel and just have the same sort of initial ""Yeah! This is great!"" followed by five hours of slowly falling enthusiasm until I return it to the proverbial shelf.

It's good! Don't get me wrong, for what it is: it's good.

What kills it for me, personally, is the setting and my completionist nature that makes me burn out on games like these."
8005,Is good game.
8006,This game take my life. <3

8009,"Gameplay is just great. Buy this, it is worth every penny."
8010,I got to explode midgets 10/10 game of the year all years.
8011,Good game
8012,It got real stale real fast even with 4 player coop. I lost any interest to play any of the newer entries. The fact that the series became more meme spouting doesn't help either.
8013,GOAT
8014,one of my favoriate Games of all time.
8015,Ya
8016,"Well, not much to say, game is awesome, just shot everything that lives, bcuz everything wants to kill u. Easy, just aim, and pull trigger, and dont stop, kill all, take loot, finish mission, take another, and repeat. After nearly 150 hours at time im writting it, im sure that ill spend another 150 farming achievements, and trying to get better gear. So if u r bored, and dont mind shoting and going from place to place just to finish mission then go ahead get BL. It will give u fun, especially weapons, so maaaaaaaaaaaaany, cant hold them all :c"
8017,Love it
8018,Hours and Hours of non stop action. A great game with or without the DLC.
8019,"For what the game aims to do, it does it pretty well.  The shooting feels good, decent amount of loot and rpg esque character progression.  If youre looking for a fun, straightforward shooter with some rpg thrown in, get it.

The plot is a bit lacking, most of the characters dont get very developed if at all.  The ending is a very big let down, it lacked closure and for a loot game, the loot was pathetic.  

But despite its problems, its a lot of fun and worth a try, if you can overlook its plot and ending."
8020,"I originally purchased this game on Xbox 360 back in 2009.
I repurchased it on Steam and it’s still as beautifully gory and addicting as it was back then.
Borderlands will forever be one of my favorite ""go to"" games, as the story is interesting, the characters are very well developed, the style is unique and gorgeous, it’s just an all-around perfect game to me.
I would recommend this game to anyone.
It's weird and wonderful.
I just absolutely love it.
"
8021,"I haven't played this game since the days it came out on the Xbox 360 , but I must say that it really holds up even now in 2016! Yes , there are several Borderlands titles now that do things that the first one did even better. There's something nostalgic about going back to Pandora the 'first time ' , at least for me . Is this game worth the $20 price it generally has these days? I'd say it is. The game is made even better if you can snag the Game of the Year Edition which gives you access to all of the additional DLC including the very awesome Secret Armory of General Knoxx! A DLC that I would say is almost like giving you a brand new game inside of Borderlands, stuffed to the brim full of content and fun. I would definitely recommend the first Borderlands to anyone looking to get into the series, or who is looking to revisit the Borderlands story/world for a second time after a long break."

[h1]REVIEW[/h1]

Borderlands is a FPS game with some RPG elements. A wise man once said: ""if Diablo and Battlefield had a baby, it would be Borderlands""*. This game combines the FPP and gunplay with level progression, skill trees, and tons of randomly generated loot.

The action takes place on a distant planet called Pandora in the future. There are rumours of some treasure being hidden in a Vault. The player can play as one of the four Vault Hunters: Lilith (specialises in deception and elemental weapons), Roland (soldier), Mordecai (sniper and gunslinger), and Brick (brute, specialises in melee and explosives). Each of them is memorable and adds to the game's replay value. Nevertheless, the story is quite weak, especially when compared to Borderlands 2. Pandora is modelled after a post-apocalyptic world, with a number of futuristic elements. Its ambience is enhanced by the unique cell-shaded graphics, marvellous soundtrack, hilarious (in a good sense) voice acting, and sense of humour. 'MURICA!

The gameplay revolves around shooting the bad guys in the face, getting their loot, and completing quests. There is a myriad of side-quests and even more weapons. Albeit the gunplay has been heavily consolised, it is fun to use all the guns. Apart from shooting, every character has a unique active skill and a skill tree. For instance, Roland can deploy a turret, which can be further upgraded to provide ammo and health to everyone nearby. Moreover, there are weapon proficiencies (bonuses for using each weapon type) and challenges to complete (e.g. scoring a certain amount of critical hits, collecting dollars, etc.). Apart from getting the loot from chests and enemies, one can also visit a few types of vendor machines. There are numerous open areas which the players can explore on foot or by car. There also is a fast travel system to navigate through them.

There are a few nuisances. Firstly, picking up mutliple items at once has a very short radius, making it somewhat tedious to gather all the loot. Secondly, in order to change the FOV, one has to use an external program. The default FOV may work fine on consoles but it is not suited for PCs. And lastly, the DLC achievements require a huge amount of grinding and some of them are purely luck-based.

In summary, Borderlands is a great game that can be enjoyed while playing solo or with friends. Its ambience and mechanics make it an outstanding title even now. I strongly recommend it.

*Or something along those lines.

8023,why are you looking at reviews? BUY THE GAME
8024,"I guess I can write another review. This one is serious though.

Starting off, only 90's kids will get this review, so if you were not born between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 1999, go ahead and stop here. 

As you already know, Borderlands is a planned prequel to the prior release, Borderlands 2. Borderlands is focused primarily on the story of Angelica Pickles, formerly known as “Naked Snake.” Naked Angelica starts her journey on a virtuous mission to extract Michael Ironside (Kiefer Sutherland) from a camp in soviet Russia in 1990, but the mission is interrupted when her father and mentor, Drew “Boss” Pickles defects to the USSR. Now Nude Angie is tasked with a new mission: Kill her father and take his title as “The Antagonist of the Video Game.” 

After killing her father in cold blood, Angelica is All Grown Up™ and goes nuclear, spawning the famous phrase, “Cynthia ‘Kazuhira’ Miller, I’m already a playground bully.”

It is very interesting to see this side of the story, watching Angelica’s psyche move into the position that leads her to make the decisions she does later down the series’ timeline, but that doesn’t mask the fact that the game is shit. It’s indecipherable from a copy of the old game with a new sticker slapped on the top of the disk. Please don’t give these devs your money, don’t buy this game for the sake of gaming. Do your part, and with your dollar vote, we WILL bring a stop to this oppressive system.

Overall I give it a 200"
8025,"Me and some of my 3 best friends jammed on this game for hours together! This game is awesome by itself with its fluid combat and its witty banter, but multiplayer is where it shines!"
8026,"The opening cutscene, there is something familiar... Humor, and a lot of it! 

Borderlands trailer had me hooked the instant I played it. Everything from the animation, the histarical humor, and overall FPS and RPG had a child idea blew me away. Stepping away from endless grind sessions of CoD and WoW, I was able to take a breath of fresh air as I scoured Pandora (taking every headshot that I could possibly get!). 

It's a wonderful site to see that even today, hundreds of people are still playing this game and are joining together to accomplish all that the game has to offer!"
8027,Was having fun time playing it./
8028,Good and essentially infinite game with lots of content. A must grab for achievement hunters.
8029,Fun!
8030,"While this game does actually lack in storyline, or at least in actual specifics and any kind of explination of anything, none of that even slightly matters. This is a game where you grab a weapon, grab some ammo, shoot the crap out of stuff, and it's awesome. Also the DLC is a must if you want to really enjoy this game to its' full potential."
8031,"[h1] Before Nipple Salads and Ribcage Slaughters, Before Crumpets and Tea Parties, Before Claptrap was Critically Endangered, There Were Four Hunters...[/h1]
I was recently made aware of the fact that the people who inspired me to play [i]Borderlands[/i] in the first place had played the games in the reverse order ([i]Pre-Sequel[/i], [i]Borderlands 2[/i] and then [i]Borderlands[/i]). I have no idea what this experience must have been like, but considering spoilers in both of the [i]Borderlands[/i] sequels, I have to imagine it was more heart-wrenching the way I did it. 
	[i]Borderlands[/i] took the rarely-seen genre of Comedy FPS and, mixed it with RPG elements and then elevated the resulting experience to masterpiece level. The FPS elements are extremely well-executed, with one of the most realistic and expansive armouries of its time. The RPG elements are subtle and uncomplicated, hitting the sweet spot between customisability and needless complexity. The story is somewhat lacking in comparison to the sequels, but considering the game was made on the down-low while Gearbox was [i]supposed[/i] to be making [i]Aliens: Colonial Marines[/i], we'll give that a pass. As for the comedic elements? Utter genius—the way the game balances farce with subtle insight on mental illness comes over brilliantly."
8032,"I just started playing Borderlands a few months ago after getting 1 and 2 in a humblebundle. So far it has been a lot of fun, I recommend to anyone who likes fps games!"
8033,"Borderlands, the first of the series, is probably also its best. With hundreds of hours of playability and a unique loot system, this title has merged traditional RPG elements and impressive first person shooting into one great ball of squishy carnage.
Each of the playable characters has something special to offer and gives the player a different experience each time. While one gets the feeling that Gearbox wasn’t overly interested in developing the rich story of Pandora in this episode, it lays down perfectly the foundations for the events in the games to come.

Let’s talk about loot. There are literally millions of guns, shields, grenades and class-mods to hunt down through the two play-throughs, making it ever more exciting when you finally get a gold rarity weapon, or even better a pearlescent one.

Character development in this game is brilliant, if not a little overwhelming at first. Besides the skill-trees which have dominated their other FPS titles, the first Borderlands also offers the development of a player’s weapon proficiency (sadly missing from the sequels), which means the more you use a specific class of gun, the better you get at wielding it.

Finally, the 4 DLC additions give the game new and exciting worlds to play in, cataclysmic weapons and gear and challenging enemies which will really test the player’s skill and intelligence.

Honestly I’ve been playing this game pretty much non-stop since it first came out in 2012 and I can see myself picking it up and having fun with it for years to come. Thank you 2k, this game has killed hours of my life."
8034,"Huge fun, loved every minute A+"
8035,pretty cool.
8036,i love playing this game even though it makes me rage sometimes...but its still awesome!
8037,"Where it all started.  A RPG FPS with complete randomness and crude humor.  What more do you need?  Tits!?  Done!  Moxxi baby!  A great classic game and I have played several thousand hour between all of them.  I am starting over again because I cant find my original CDs, so 2K and Gearbox get another sale (so earned).  Welcome to Pandora, and never mind the annoying yet funny and clueless Claptrap.  Enjoy the radomness of weapon stats and open world exploration.  Definitely a top 10 favorite series (and I have been gaming for about 20 years +).  I hope they keep them coming.  Go kick some ass and experience some EXPLOOOSIONNSS!!!! *Mr. Torgue*.   8/10 (no game is perfect)."
8038,fun
8039,bl00dy heck
8040,"Good game, excellent story. It is worth it."
8041,Sweet game! Love this game almost as much as the second game. the second one is a updated version of this game. You will want to buy the second game to see your charaters come back. The story in the second is how this game happened and happens not to long after this game. Highly recommened!
8042,"The first game that I sacrificed my sleep for.

What else can I say that hasn't been said? It's entertaining as fuck (especially with a friend) and fully functional on Win 10/newer OS users (as far as I know). The only complaint I have would be the DLC's are still a bit costly despite how freaking old this game is.



Buy it."
8043,"Love the game but the ending is a rough one. 
"
8044,"Pandora is the place to live,,, and die.. most likely die ;)"
8045,"Gearbox's first take on a cross between diablo-like roleplaying game and a first person shooter.  I spent a lot of time in it and had a lot of fun.  However, the sequel is superior to it in nearly every possible way and is a better place to put your money and time.

As the roleplay elements are based off of diablo, killing things and gathering loot to progress what you will spend most of your time doing.  The guns, shields, and other items are randomly generated with varying rarities and manufactures which determine the performance and what numbers the gun will improve on the most.  The quest system is there and it is as in-depth as Diablo's was, which is to say there is no depth to it and it's implemented as minimally as possible.  You receive a quest with some flavor text, you may or may not have some audio going with.  It could be said this improves pacing in a game with a multiplayer focus, but the sequels demonstrate this is not the case.  There is a lot of quirk and crazy among the denizens of Pandora, but this only hides how shallow the shallow the world is in order to keep you interested.

The player characters and NPC's of Pandora have no depth to them.  Your character will only comment on combat banter, critical hits, kills, injuries, and such without any involvement in the story.  The NPC's are little more than quest dispensers which dole out money and guns as you kill stuff.  The enemies have more characterization with the psychos and bandits screaming random shit as they try to kill you, the effect makes combat that much more interesting.

The gunplay and combat was where the game put the most effort into.  The shooting is functional, and hardly the best among shooters of the era.  The health system is reminiscent of Halo, with regenerating shields and non-regenerating health.  The enemy AI is goofy and not at all smart, lampshaded by the aforesaid quirk of Pandora.

However, the guns you shoot are a joy to play with.  Finding a new toy to play with and killing things with your existing arsenal is going to be the thing which keeps you most motivated to play.  The different guns behave differently, fill different roles in you arsenal, and some have some wild effects.  The further into the game you get the more pronounced this is and the more of a joy it is to play with these weapons.

Grenades function similarly to grenades in any FPS where they have a dedicated button.  The difference here is they can be set up to bounce, stick, break apart, or do several other things before exploding.  They can also be set up to explode in a normal explosion or an elemental explosion.  They become another toy in the box of toys you get to play with alongside your guns.

The action skills each character has will alter combat and define the difference between each of the four characters.  Roland can set down a turret, Lilith can turn invisible and drop a PBAoE, Brick destroys things with melee, and Mordecai sends his bird to kill things.  These abilities can be further modified with skills, Roland creating an AoE ammo regen ring around his turret as an example.  The skills also set up a role, affecting the rate of fire, damage, health, shields, and other passive abilities of your character.  You also can set up some abilities which proc on events such as kills or critical hits, granting you even more pronounced benefits such as health regeneration.  This all makes you put some thought into your character's skill build and what they are equipped with.

Multiplayer is what sold this game and keeps people playing it.  If you want a game you can play with friends and sink many hours into, you can not go wrong with Borderlands. Likewise, if you like playing alone, this is a game to stay away from.  The net-code is good enough that I don't notice any problems and with the migration to steamworks, its a lot better than it used to be.  The enemies will rebalanced as more or fewer players join and leave, keeping the game from getting boring.  Other players bringing more and different things to an already chaotic combat makes combat that much more fun and chaotic.  Being one of the few games in the shoot and loot genre, it still retains a sizable community of players even with the sequels.

With all that said, why the down recommendation?  Its because Borderlands 2 exists and it does everything better, save for character balance.  If you are trying to get into the series you are better served starting with the second game.  If you do purchase this one, pick up the GotY edition as all the DLC, except for the Underdome, is worth picking up if you enjoyed playing."
8046,Lots of achievements for the completionist in you. Great gun variety.
8047,"I played this very briefly co-op with my cousin when it first came out, and then I stumbled across it again in a Humble Bundle.  

Leaving all of the Gearbox asshattery and art style misappropriation accusations out of it, this is a very enjoyable if shallow RPG experience.  I would even argue that the art style itself, while unique, doesn't ultimately contribute much to the finished product.

Character customization is limited in terms of skills and the ability to upgrade certain proficiencies - you're basically stuck with a small tech tree and if you want to increase weapon skills you actually have to use those weapons.  It makes sense on paper, but if you're knee deep in a protracted firefight and you literally do not have the ammunition you need for a certain type of weapon, you're going to be leveling up whatever you're stuck with at the moment.  One of my biggest gripes with the game is that you can routinely end up without ammunition.

There are also some minor AI issues that can often make a campaign/quest go from impossibly difficult to stupidly easy just by respawning after you die.  It's as though once you're dead the enemies totally lose track of you. On the other hand, there is no distance you can get to where an enemy with a shotgun (a SHOTGUN) won't be able to at least graze you before he has to reload.  This can get annoying.

Aside from these 2 bits, it's a fun way to kill some hours.  And there is a ton of content - I've only played for a total of 20 or so hours and I'm barely halfway through - this doesn't count the DLC, which is refreshingly well-done and enjoyable.

Get the GOTY edition, it is worth $30."
8048,Bes. Game. Ever.
8049,"An amazing tale of shooting and looting, filles with memorable characters and awesome moments. Jump in the story alone or make the experience even better with co-op! I will always recomend this game to anyone looking for an amazing game!"
8050,"Hello, Travlers!

Sort of a cross between Mad Max and World of Warcraft, Borderlands is like an MMO for folks who don't like playing with other folks. First and foremost an FPS, this game uses numerous RPG elements (upgradable stats, special abilities, weapons and items of varying quality and traits, etc.) to help you shape how your character deals with the dangerous world of Pandora. 

The best way to describe the setting is that it would be soul-crushingly depressing if it weren't gut-bustingly funny (a quality which the sequel makes strides in building on). Overall it's sort of a space western. 

When I played the game, online multiplayer was disabled due to GameSpy being shut down. I'd heard that they were working on patching it to work via some other method, but I never did follow up to see if that happened. Either way, the game was still a blast on singleplayer, just a few later DLC bosses ended up being a bit of a pain. Give it a go, it's lots of fun."
8051,"The game that started it all. Still the best in the franchise too, imo"
8052,I love this game. I would recommend it to anyone that's a fan of FPSes and RPGs.
8053,SO FUN! It's always hard picking what character but the game has enough replay value to do more than one! In fact most people will find themselves playing a second time to do it at the next level of difficulty.
8054,Lots of guns
8055,"Lots of customization as far as VR display controller, steam stream etc. Also very adjustable for various hardware setups. The game itself is also a very unique style and the game play is solid. The story is your standard run of the mill myth and legend mixed into an apocalyptic world."
8056,"This game turns the FPS genre into something new, something fresh, and something that not only ""FPS-players"" can enjoy (i don't really play shooters, however i enjoy theses games surprisingly much). It mixes with the RPG genre and does so tremendously, which concomitantly turns out victorious. The different classes are fun and slightly different, even more so with the different skill trees you can build. The guns are amazing, and can range from a shity revolver to rocket launchers that shoot lightning and SubMachine Guns with exploding bullets. The story is a bit hard to follow, as you barely get any dialogue as opposed to text in the game, which might be unfamiliar if you have played Borderlands 2, wherein you actually get to hear everything you want to know. The music is ok; it's iconic and all, and really fits in every area throughout the game. It's nothing special, but I can still recognize and remember it.

The cartoonish graphic is a slight appeal, however might discourage some people. It is not much of a bother for me. Borderlands has a very brand humour something that really causes me to like the game alot more, as it makes me more familiarized and contained.

The game is decently long, but becomes better with DLC.
It does in fact feel incomplete without the DLC. I got the GOTY for about 8€ when it was on sale, as with almost every game I purchase. I would recommend you do the same, unless the game already is on such a low price that it wouldn't be a scam.

If you want Borderlands 2 to surpass your expectations, or if you wish to waste a couple hundred hours, buy this game. It's a good game, however gets put to shame juxtaposed to its sequel. 

TL;DR: It's a good game. Some things are awesome, some things are great, and the things that are not great are at least good. Definitely worth a try!
7/10 at worst."
8057,Diablo with guns
8058,"Boderlands is awesome game! Very funny to play in single and have:
+ Funny jokes
+ Easy to learn
+ Lot of loot
+ Lot of missions
+ Single player and co-op 
-  Very difficult to play playthrough 2.5 alone
-  Few slots to store weapons
-  Few players online (at the moment)
"
8059,Chaotic but fun.
8060,"Step 1: Buy game
Step 2: Download Game
Step 3: Play Game
Step 4: Grab Some Guns
Step 5: Shoot Some People/ Things Heads and Watch Them EXPLODE
Step 6: Repeat Steps 3-6"
8061,One of my favorites
8062,Fuckin sucks and is ghey 10/10 GOTY
8063,"Overall, this game is a 7 out of 10.  While there were moments that were very interesting and fun, there were also those moments where it fell flat on its face.  Only worth buying if really cheap."
8064,"Play this game with a mouse, do not use a mouse pad like I did.
Better aestetics and western-cowboy feel and future space stuff without too much tech and high-sci-fi. Gritty and down to earth it is a fun, fast pace first person shooter with rpg elements such as skill tree and customizable through loot.
rouge like elements and swift action sequences paced with deep story elements that drive the narative in a rich and developed world populated with interesting, insane, annoying, funny, cut-throat and suave."
8065,"Couldn't think that i would actually like a shooter game.
The comic art style is just too good.Love the story too."
8066,"I have played Borderlands AFTER I played Borderlands 2. The evolution is obvious, however Borderlands is still a great game. A player is thrown into a wasteland inhabited by bandits, skags and other creatures from hell. However, even in this difficult terrain, hilarious jokes and great gameplay are really top notch in it's genre. If you wish to start the whole Borderlands series, I would recommend starting here as you will encounter many familiar faces later in Borderlands 2. It is not as beautiful nor as elaborate as BL2, however the first Borderlands offers tens of hour of fun gameplay and can easily be played even on older computers from 2010's era. 8/10"
8067,"Borderlands is a truly fantastic video game. I have it for my Xbox 360 as well as PC, and while I didn't expect to like it since I don't generally enjoy shooters, I'm glad I convinced myself to give it a chance, because the series has become one if my favorites. The crude humor may become grating for some, but it makes me laugh and takes away a lot of the frustration since I really do suck at this game."
8068,"I enter a big world, where i had a lot to explore and show the enimies who has the biggest gun. At the beginning, the game is really easy, maybe a little bit difficult, since I  recognize which enemies i can take on und which not. After i cleared of the first and second area, i thought the game would now be very boring but lucky for me i was wrong.  

Why? Because on the next step of the story, i met a lot of interesting new buildings, new characters and i had a lot of fun to explore the region also to compare the new weapons i found.

Normally, a very good game and i enjoyed playing it, really, but there are more than one areas, where the enemies are fully overpowered and its very difficult to beat them. Fortunately it is more in the middle of the game and at the end. But even at the end i did not recognize what i had to do to beat the last big enemy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For you germans guys :

Ich hatte sehr viel Spass mit dem Spiel, startete in einer großen Umgebung, wurde sehr gut mit der Steuerung des  Spiel vertraut gemacht und konnte völlig entspannt starten. Etwas schwierig fand ich es herauszufinden mit welchen Gegnern ich mich anlegen kann und mit welchen nicht. 
Naja, nachdem ich dann die ersten Karten erkundet habe, hatte ich schon die Befürchtung das es nun sehr langweillig werden wird und sich alles wiederholt.

Glücklicherweise lag ich hier vollkommen falsch, da ich in den neuen Bereichen, die ich nach und nach freischaltete absolut beeindruckende Charaktäre, und auch Landschaften kennenlernte, die mich offen und sprachlos erscheinen ließen.
Nicht weil es so ungewöhnlich ist, sondern weil das Spiel nun schon fast 10 Jahre alt ist und ich es beeindruckend finde was damals schon möglich war.

Da könnten sich viele Spielehersteller eine ordentliche Scheibe von abschneiden. Jedenfalls hat mir das Spiel auf lange Sicht gesehen sehr viel Spass gemacht, einzig an einigen Stellen droschen die Gegnermassen derart auf mich ein, das es mir sehr schwer gefallen ist zu erkennen, auf welche Art und Weise ich dieser Gegnerübermacht Herr werden kann.

Ganz besonders hat mir auch die Hintergrundmusik gefallen. Da macht es mir wesentlich mehr Spass Gebiete erneut zu erkunden, da es oftmals vorkommt, das in eigentlich abgeschlossenen Gebieten neue Aufträge freigeschaltet werden."
8069,I ended up getting this game in a humble bundle with all the DLC's exept claptraps one (I ended up getting it later for 79cents during a sale). Having played Borderlands 2 for a decent amount of time and some of The Pre-Sequel this game is pretty good. The graphics are also pretty standard for it's age. I haven't played a ton of this yet but for sure will in the near future.
8070,"I played Borderlands 2, and loved the old characters. So I bought this game, excited to play as brick after having so much fun with Krieg.

 [b]What I noticed off the bat.[/b]

1. The company names at the beginning were unskippable.
2. The HUD was ugly and unfinished.

But my HUGE problem with this game is the insanely low FOV. Stuff like this is what irritates me most in games. When you cant see anything because your character is zoomed in so far you feel like they're using bonoculars while their neck is stretched out 4 feet in front of them.

So, my conclusion is don't get this game. period."
8071,Solid game!
8072,"10 out of 10 would delete again
it was to repetitive every singles quest was kinda the same"
8073,it took me 24 hours to complete this shit and the last bossfight was easy
8074,"Borderlands is one of the hugest fps/rpg games and it's really fun even in single player. if you team up with 3 of your friends you get the most fun and you just can't stop playing :D it's huge and fun, also has several small problems but it's heavily recommended.
9/10"
8075,"I usually don't go for games like this at all! i'm more of a dating sim, kind of person but a friend bought this game for me and the second one and i love it so far!! i totally reccomend this!! The character design!! 20/10 beautiful, just like Mad Moxxi <3"
8076,pretty fun game some times it can make you mad and if you just get tired of farming you get a moded weapon it really not that hard to make or get some one else to give you a moded weapon but if you want the expernce the way creators wanted you to have i would suggsted at least play through the game once without any moded weapons truly is a very good game.
8077,10/10 would loot weapons / kick psycho victim ass / get dr. z's injection / shoot claptrap / fuck tannin again.
8078,One of the best games ever!
8079,РПГ+ФПС=Borderlands... 11/10
8080,"i accidently rufunded it :(
"
8081,I spent a lot of time in this game on 360 and loved it. This is an amazing coop game and is worth your time.
8082,"An amazing game set in an amazing world and gives you a sense of wonder. I tell you this game is going to easily set me back 100 hours without playing multiplayer. Takes longer to play through alone first off, and secondly im just enjoying the enviroments and charcter design and the whole approach to the game. Initially it was meant to be a much more realistic game! I recently read the article about the design changes because it was too similar to rage in artistic style at first. Either way they did a great job and have literally created a series that will have its name etched in throes of Video Games for eons. First of all, there are so many weapons in the game it gives a whole new meaning to the term ""throwaways."" The amount of guns i have to sift through to make sure im not throwing away ""that right one,"" can sometimes be mindboggling. Totally worth it. Got some friends and wanna play through this awesome game and have a good time doing it? Make sure you and your buddies grab a copy and LAN it up or get online and Play Multiplayer. Totally worthwhile experience.

My only real con to this game is the fact that so far (Im only level 30 so far) ive only been inside one type of vehicle. There should have been some variety.

Still a great game though."
8083,Delicious.
8084,FPS and a RPG <3
8085,"It's okay.. 6/10

I only play it because my friend makes me play it with him."
8086,"Compared to the newer games, Borderlands 1 falls a little bit behind, just because the gameplay improved so much in Borderlands 2.

Doesn't mean it's bad though. Borderlands 1 has less silly humor, more gore and also very worthwhile DLC (except Moxxi's Underdome). Just forget about the story, because if you really get down to it, it's just an elaborate excuse to level your character and collect loot. And I gotta hand it to Gearbox for restoring Multiplayer capabilities through Steamworks.

Plus, every Borderlands game with its own DLC where you get to shoot hundreds of Claptraps is a clear winner by default for me."
8087,"It's a fun game; though I bought after its initial popularity so the only people I ever saw playing online were usually hacking and ruined the fun, so I just played solo. So basically if you can't convice some friends to play with you then play offline by your lonely self."
8088,"Sweet game, not quite as good as borderlands 2 but still has the great gun combat, fun co-op stuff and heaps of cool characters. Nothing beats finding that perfect gun"
8089,"One of the best games I have ever played. Great story, tons of action and as the trailer says ,,87 bazillion guns"" I have yet to find more than two of the same gun! Very rewarding missions, epic feeling after killing an enemy that you really shouldnt be able to because you are underleveled. TONS of locations and enemies. Action packed, no joke the action never stops. A lot of achevements and weapon effects! The game is even fun after you finish it! You can choose to play it all again ( I recoment that ) with your whole inventory and level kept the same! 4 Player co-op is just the cheery on top! I don't think it would be as fun as it was playing it the first time with my friend! The one thing it does lack however is vehicles, it only has one (Or two if you count the rocket launcher and machine gun types different) and ofcourse you can customize the colour. But still the lack of vehicles in the game is not a setback. Also a good thing is that this game can run on a ,,potato"". I have a bad computer and I have no problem runing it on 60fps with medium settings. You might need to tinker with the resolution though. 
To sum up, if you like good story , grinding, epic missions and shooting everything you see, you will like this game!"
8090,10/10 would buy again
8091,"This game is like driving through Eastern New Mexico, with guns -- The Hills Have Guns.    Play it.   Don't drive through Eastern New Mexico."
8092,Awesome game now i just need to get my fiance a laptop so we can play this together like old times!
8093,"I don't know, I'm not sure how to feel about this game. On the one hand, I have a pc that should be able to run this game fine yet I continuously have problems doing so (fps spikes from 30s to 60 to 10s, with avg in the 50s), I hate the shooting, and the writing. I want to overlook all of that (even the bad writing which I REALLY hate), but what I want to come at this game for is the loot. And the loot is all so bad; I think I'm near the end of my first playthrough, without doing any dlc, and I feel like I'm just vendoring most of the loot I pick up so I'm just using weapons I got 10 or so levels ago. Maybe it's better post game in the dlc. I hope so.

And despite my feeling on this, I just bought 2, which I know has worse writing and heard had worse loot. Hopefully the loot is better. I won't get my hopes up."
8094,Borderlands is a really fun game to play with friends or on your own. The DLC's are also very fun to play (General Knoxx's Army for instance) as they just add more interesting missions to do.
8095,☺
8096,"Great game.  Not very balanced class wise, but great story and fin game play."
8097,"Stuck? Phasewalk out of there.
6/9 would play again, oh wait you can."

8099,"I've spent more than 300 hours on each Borderlands game on console (PS3 - PS4). This is a masterpiece.

See that buy button ? Click it. Now. DO IT !"
8100,"Feels so diffrent to bl2, but so fun. but, all the guns feel the same, atleast where I am."
8101,"ok lets start. Its long its great you never get tired of it great gun drops
 
you are allways exited about chests and boss drops has the challenge but not to easy or to hard to it great soundtrack 
 great multiplayer   GREAT dlc addons there long lots of quests good gun drops from it.  (even the cyan)  cool monsters  and bosses  i have this on pc & console and i think its best on pc. I will save the worst for last the final boss :/
 made me really mad such a dissapointment not gonna spoil it but it was jsut really dissapointing."
8102,"Awesome game. I've been playing almost all day. Probably one of my favorites in my library. Anyone who likes mission-based, first person shooters should definitely play this game. XD"
8103,10/10 would do the puh again
8104,Have fun being raped by over 9000 skags!
8105,jävla bra spel asså!
8106,"Borderlands is a fun game to play and has a lot of content to cover.
+ Plenty of Content.
+ A load of weapons to select.
+ Tough challenges/enemies.
+ Great DLC areas.
+ Humorous and Serious at the same time.
+ Still great to come back to.

- Sometimes you need to overcome a tough challenge to advance the story, can be very frustrating in Single Player.
- Lots of cheated weapons/armour that withstands infinite damage/one-shots enemies.
- Lots of End-Game EXP groups that kills the progress of the game for newer characters.
- Second playthrough can be tedious."
8107,the best of all first person shooter looting tree skills open world ever had!!!
8108,"Stunning Game, Ive replayed it 3-4 times and keep going back to it. Hours and Hours of game play, tons and tons of guns, humour. Great fun with friends and alone. I cannot recommend this game any higher 20/10"
8109,I'm bored of these lands...
8110,Loved it.
8111,Get the four pack and play with friends. Trust me it's worth it. That is all.
8112,"I just didn't enjoy this at all. The humour was pretty purile and just not funny (and i like crass humour) and the gameplay was terribly dull. I didn't last an hour before i decided that there's better games to be enjoying my time on. I got it because so many raved about it, but i've since discovered that people seem pretty polorised about this game - they love it or they hate it.

I'd suggest playing it at a friends house for a bit to decide if it's worth the money for you. It wasn't for me."
8113,"Tons of fun, great comedy.  The DLC are just as good as the main game."
8114,
8115,"Classic, much content, brought me to this franchise. 10/10"
8116,"I mean its not Borderlands 2 but i like going back and playing it after a couple years, great game"
8117,"Borderlands is the first game in the Borderlands Series, originally released in 2009. It is a mixture of RPG and FPS where you can play as one of four characters, a Soldier, Hunter, Berserker, and Siren, and complete missions for various NPC's. You start on the planet of Pandora, where you are sent by the Dahl Corporation to locate a vault containing alien technology, which is believed to exist on the planet. The planet had previously been abandoned by several large corporations due to their inability to find any alien tech, so it is a broken wasteland of desert and scattered settlements, with wild creatures and raiders a plenty. There is more to the plot, but I don't want to spoil the surprises for anyone.  

The graphics look a bit cartoonish, almost a comic book feel to them; However, there are settings and even Mods available to make the game less cartoonish. Borderlands has a Single Player mode, Multiplayer, and Co-operative mode.
Each character that you can choose from has a different play style. There are mulitple DLC's available for Borderlands such as; The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, Claptrap's New Robot Revolution, The Secret Armory of General Knoxx, and Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot. The game also spawned a Sequel, Borderlands 2, and a pre-sequel, Tales from the Borderlands: The Pre-sequel. Even though I don't personally like the cartoonish way the graphics look, there are workarounds for that and the game is still fun to play. It has a pretty good tutorial and very little learning curve, so anyone new to the series should be able to jump right in and learn from the playable tutorial. the NPC's are amusing, voice acting is pretty good and the game has decent music. Borderlands is worth purchasing, for those who like RPG-FPS games."
8118,"Super fun, a  must play game"
8119,"To me the best thing that happen in Borderlands was Dr. NED.

10/10"
8120,Worth the play! =)
8121,Best awesome co-op fps/rpg on pandora.
8122,It's so fucking good man... woman idk what you are.
8123,"A good, and funny first persone shooter, but not that versatile as its sequel"
8124,"Good Game with friends , but too hard kill people ;( :D whatever nice game"
8125,"I just finished this game about a day ago and I can say it was definitely a frustrating experience for me. I did enjoy the game and I would recommend it to anyone who is into First-Person Shooters and action/adventure but I immediately uninstalled it after I finished it. It reminds me of the first Assassin's Creed, great game initially but eventually gets repetitive and, to be honest, I kept playing it just to finish it. 

For me, the frustration came from the random enemy spawning when there was already a ton of enemies to deal with. Try running away to re-charge your shields and run into 5 more. Walk into a random part of town, see nobody walk slowly, turn around and random dude is in your face.

Now the things I did enjoy, I do like the fact you have to level up your character. I enjoyed leveling up my player and selecting where to use my skill points. The graphics are beautiful and the detail on the characters is pretty god damn amazing. Killing bad guys is pretty enjoyable too, especially when you connect with a perfect head shot.

It's a pretty good game and one worth checking it out if you're into FPS. Part of my frustration also came from that i'm just not very good at FPS so your experience will probably be more positive than mine."
8126,"Borderlands is a hybrid FPS / RPG that combines elements of Diablo, Halo, and the old Mad Max movie series. It tells the tale of 4 mercenaries, called Vault Hunters, who scour the planet of Pandora searching for an ancient alien vault, rumored to contain treasure and power beyond belief. Along the way, they battle bandits, soldiers, monsters, and aliens, all the while helping out different townsfolk and eccentric scientists who are always offering weapons and cash in exchange for work. 
The game is huge and offers a multitude of quests, literally millions of different guns, and four distinct classes that all manipulate the battlefield differently. It can be played solo, but co-op is encouraged and can add many extra hours of replayability. It's extremely enjoyable, has great storytelling [spoiler] although you'll be reading most dialogue, rather than listening to it [/spoiler], features a New Game+ mode, and has quite a few epic set pieces.
However, despite this, the original Borderlands is lacking in quite a few areas that make later entries in the series so spectacular...

Charismatic, hilarious villain? Nah.
Gripping storyline with plot twists and unexpected deaths? Nah. [spoiler] well, Steele, I guess... [/spoiler]
Tons of great voice acting and dialogue? Not so much.
DLC out the ass that really expands the universe? Eh... [spoiler] Knoxx and Claptrap's, maybe... [/spoiler]
Huge differences between gun manufacturers and the need for high level gear? Surprisingly, no.

But what this game lacks in what many consider the defining traits of this series, it makes up for in something else... 

It has Brick as a playable character.

You see that badass enemy over there? Big dude? Definitely gonna shred your ass if you try and rush him?

Brick will uppercut that guy so hard his head will [strike] pop off [/strike] explode. The soul of Mr. Torgue lives in Brick's hands, and shit goes boom whenever those beautiful meat hunks connect with any fleshy or armored surface.

You see that boss over there that will blast you if you even think about coming out of cover?

Brick punches the cover. Brick then runs over to the boss. Brick punches the boss's family, friends, and entire religion. Then Brick punches the boss. The boss is now dead. The universe doesn't even register the fact that the boss ever existed.

Brick does not care about being shot. Brick does not care how badass an enemy is. Brick will punch that enemy, all the while being filled with bullets, and that enemy will [strike] die [/strike] be erased from history.

Borderlands GOTY Edition is often on sale for $8. For the price of some crappy buttrock album at WalMart; for the price of some crappy latte from Starbucks; for the price of a new pair of underwear (which you aren't going to wear anyway), you can own what is arguably one of the greatest games of all time. 

And you can be Brick.

Buy this game. Experience Borderlands in all its glory. Be Brick. Punch things. Win forever."
8127,"the best coop fps (together with the Borderlands 2) on the market with the funniest characters and great gameplay.

be careful for Earl though - he's crazy."
8128,"I'm not keen on shooters at all but this game was a lot of fun and the story was pretty cool too. I've finished a 2nd playthrough with my Siren and I've started a new game as Mord. Despite some of it being repetitive and having fetch quests, this game is a lot of fun to replay. I always play with another person though - perhaps that's what makes it more fun."
8129,"I love this game, I've also played all the other borderlands, defiantly a great game to get into and stick with"
8130,"It's a lovely meld of FPS and RPG, as they have said, done with a curious 3D rendering of comic-book-type art, which in many cases actually looks better than some of the pixellated crap we eat these days.  The Partial Controller Support basically means you just have to look up in the Options menu or guess at what the buttons do.  I'm giving this three thumbs up, and no, I'm not telling you who's missing a thumb lately."
8131,billions of hours may be spent looting the world-renowned knoxx armory for light orange terrible defenders

8133,gr8 game 10/10
8134,Great loot. Great game. Great story. Much to do and never gets boring.
8135,"The Godfather of multiplayer FPS's.

This game is definitely one of the most amazing games ever made to date. It's 2019, and I still play this game like it came out yesterday.

I started this series off with this game the year it came out, as I think there was a free weekend for it back in 2009. It was the only game I played the entire weekend. I immediately knew that the game was going to consume me. I then bought it for the full price the following Monday. Once again, just like the weekend, I only played it for the entire week. At least I realized I had a problem playing it.

I highly recommend playing the entire Borderlands series because they all are very well made, have good replay value, and have good graphics.

PS - Please release Borderlands 3 already Gearbox, we're desperate..."
8136,"This style of game has become somewhat of a fad (short interval quests, multiplayer, comic book art). But I consider this to be the original, and so far the best."

8148,Good.
8149,"I only recommend this game if you have not played any after it. If you have, you will feel like something is missing the entire time."
8150,"There's so much to do in this game! Side quests to keep you on your toes, levels, choice of what type of player you are. This game is incredibly addictive and I love it. The DLC selection provides even more carnage and enjoyment.

10/10, will undoubtedly never uninstall.

Will definitely be purchasing the second game."
8151,"[b]Borderlands[/b] is a pretty decent game; an even better co-op game. Good for the brain-dead gaming sessions whilst listening to music or podcasts. The story of borderlands isn't anything spectacular, it's not something I cared about whilst playing, however there are some charming characters to be found within. Aesthetically the game sports stylistic comic book-esque graphic that not only look great, but is a nice change from those games that strive for realism. As far as being a first-person shooter goes, borderlands does most if not everything right, reloading whilst sprinting is a godsend. Not only did I enjoy the combat but the loot system is great, always nice to find a better gun, and well guns are pretty much Borderlands' thing. Highly recommend if you have the friends to play it with.

8153,"A game so good I bought it four times, the sequel twice, and the pre-sequel once."
8154,"Wonderful Shooter 8/10 Funny and engaging, weird but interesting storyline."
8155,"Love the weapons, love the story, love this game."
8156,"one of my all time favorites, still better then brd2 or brd1.5, if you want to burn sometime there is no better way. should have played it in its heyday."
8157,awesome game totally in love with it first had it on my xbox but because it was so awesome also bought it on steam
8158,"Amazing game, IMO better than the second. Don't overlook this game, 10/10."
8159,Great game. Hooked me up on the Borderlands universe.
8160,"""Lose yourself, and go. I'll be watching...""

Rating: 7 out of 10, an excellent matrimony of the ARPG and FPS genres, held back by its clunky mission design, repetative gameplay, and disappointing story implimentation. Now the sequel, on the other hand..."
8161,"This game is so good I played the whole campaign with the worst possible graphics at the point my eyes hurt and now I figured out how to change them to great graphics I'm not even doing Christmas because this game is even better.
 
10/10 Would bleed from the eyes again.
 
And if you though this is good, wait to see Borderlands 2.
 
PD: Warning, purchase the GOTY editions."
8162,Great game!
8163,"Borderlands 1 sets a good scene for borderlands 2 but it is not as good. The story is not as good and the end boss is not explained at all. The gameplay is repetitive but has some extra features that are good, such as weapon proficiencies. Also the fact that the Eridian guardians are around at ancient sites is a nice touch.

Weapon effetcs for the elemental guns are cooler than the sequel but other than that the guns dont change between games; other than the merging of revolvers and pistols.

Lastly, get used to brown, desaturated scrapheaps. 

7/10"
8164,GONNA SQUEAL BEFORE WE COOK YA?
8165,"Something every friendship needs, fighting over precious loot. 10/10 with rice."
8166,"I'm very late to the Borderlands party, but I loved the hell out of this game (other than the Mad Moxxi's Undereome Riot DLC)."
8167,"oldie but goldie, great game, great series"
8168,9/10
8169,Love this game. It's good in every aspect
8170,good times :')
8171,"The story's nothing to get excited about, but a great user interface make the game's complexities easy for all to enjoy...
 Fun combat and a steady flow of rewards make this journey an enjoyable one."
8172,Great
8173,"I regret not starting here, on the base game. You get into the world of the vaultskeeper, here's where the story, that will repeat itself in the following games with other places, bosses and characters, begins. You have one main mission, but a hundred side ones, hours of entertainment, but shorter than the 2nd one."
8174,"10/10 
would kill a phsyco again"
8175,"50/50 game; enemies are difficult for no reason and is not fixed even though it's 5 years old, buy borderlands 2 instead if you want a more fun experience."
8176,Great game if you can get past the fact that it did NOT age well. In its time I rocked 60 + hours on the ps3.
8177,"Dude i had so much fun while playing this!
Havent gotten the last dlc though rest was a blast."
8178,"Borderlands is a game you will either enjoy, hate, or find tedious. There are many people who may hate this game just due to the type of game it is. If you don't like shooters this is not a game you will enjoy but I'm guessing you already knew that, so lets get more specific. 

If you are the type of person who likes shooters but likes a good story added into it as well... this may not be the game for you, as this game dosen't really have much to offer in that regard. The dialogue is non existent and is all texts, except for the cut scenes and the overall story is very simplistic. 

If you are the type of person who likes to shoot and blow things up and find new items, shoot and blow things up and find new items, shoot and blow things up.... repeat...  this is the game for you.... but if you get frustrated by dying alot... maybe not. I could probably guarantee you will die again and again. 

As it stands I will say that the game accomplishes its intended objective and so I will recommended it to its intended demographic. But to anyone else I would steer clear of this game. It is repetetive to some degree but the challenge combined with the crazy guns you get along the way will keep some entertained for a very long time."
8179,I enjoy the game itself. It pretty kewl to check out the storyline.. Now I am playing BL 2! :D
8180,hecka fun time especially with pals ;;DDDD DD
8181,aweome game. That is really all I have to say about this one.
8182,I love the Borderlands games so much. The story is amazing and the game play is great! Nothing but positive thoughts with all of these games. I've yet to play the pre-sequal but I know from what I've expierenced with the first 2 that I will LOVE it. I'm so excited to play these games in my Stream you have no idea <3
8183,"Borderlands....think about it, what do you think of? 
It makes you think of an area that has walls around it, but
this game allows you to go to places you never thought you could go. 
1,2 are two of the best games I have ever played and can be played over multiple times. always find myself playing these games. Great game to play with some buddies! 
buy it, reg price or sale, worth the money."
8184,"Just an all around awesome game, Story is great and the characters are awesome. Would recommend strongly."
8185,"11/10
This masterpiece of a game was the start of my borderlands addiction. Farming general knoxxs armory for hours trying to get a pearlescent, farming crawmerax, making multiple characters, This game is truley a work of art and i highly recommend it."
8186,"If you're looking for a good fps adventure that will last for days on end, this game is for you... although the ending to this game is absolutely terrible (one of the most anti-climactic and unrewarding endings in a video game I have ever played). The side quests and main characters are really what make this game worth its price. This game is by far (In my opinion) better than the second game. I played the second game and I just can't stand the story."
8187,A very fun game to past the time with
8188,It's worth time  for playing
8189,u
8190,"I got this game during the holiday sale because it was cheap and a lot of people seem to love it. I just don't happen to be one of them. I guess playing co-op could be fun, but I got it to play single-player. There really isn't any story that keeps me engaged and it seems all I do is random tasks in a landfill. Too bad I decided to buy both BL1 and 2. I'm hoping the second one is better."
8191,11/10 gr8
8192,"Great game. Great DLC. Engaging and interesting story and gameplay. Cannot say anything about multiplayer as I only play singleplayer. Definitely worth its price. Good replayability. 
What else is there to say/ Get the GOTY edition and start playing."
8193,Moxxie likes it skaggy style
8194,"Started as Siren, played for 5 minutes. Within 5 minutes I had been murdered by spiked dogs with homicidal tendencies. 10/10 would play again."
8195,"The original Borderlands what can i say .

The game is what i like to call a shooter looter lol.
The story and quests can last a very long time 
and with all the DlC plus four people to play as you get lots of replay 
value.

The game is fun and pure blast good as a single player and even more fun 
as a multiplayer 

So what are you waiting for? if you have never played borderlands
Take a trip  to pandora"
8196,"My favorite game!
Awesome story and characters, never get's boring."
8197,A fun and exciting game

8200,"After playing through it the first time (taking 27 hours), I can safely say I see the reason why a lot of people liked it when it came out and still like it now. Though personally, I'm a much bigger fan of Borderlands 2, this is still a really fun and solid game to play.

 The only problems I had were occasional issues with rendering background details, huge frame drops, and all of the frame tearing that could ever exist. Seriously, it was horrible. I got used to it, but that's not something I should have to get used to. There was also no option to adjust render distance, and even with re-downloading the game, I had persistent problems with rendering all background animations. I also had to run the game on a lowered resolution (1366x768) to get these premium-status bugs/glitches. If I ran the game on 1080p w/ any settings adjustments, it got worse, and it stayed below 25 fps.

 The game mechanics, however, were fairly simply and not hard to get used to. I had quite a bit of fun with the battle sequences of fighting Rakk, Skags, Bandits, [spoiler]Crimson Lance[/spoiler], and [spoiler]The Destroyer[/spoiler]. All guns were simple to use, so there's nothing too special there aside from the several million variations they arrive in. And the legendary weapons. And the cyan/pearlescent weapons. And the [spoiler]Eridian weapons[/spoiler].

 All in all, I'd say that this game was worth the money, and is certainly fun to play. Humor could use a touch-up (what humor there is is either really funny, weak, or obscene), and the character face animations and all character movements (whether it be player or NPC) could've been better, but the plot itself is good and the game is fun to play. This game could've been better, but it was already good in it's own regards. I mean, it's not Borderlands 2.

8/10 - I had fun"
8201,"Great story, replayability, conversations, awkward and funny moments, characters you will bound."
8202,FAB
8203,no airplanes 9/11
8204,"-Buy this game
-Play it
-Spend hours and hours
-Forget your life
-Done"
8205,"Ding! I enjoyed every second on exploring and shooting. This is my first game on Steam and got to say, loved it.

+ Gameplay
+ Graphics
+ Side Missions
+ Main Story
+ Controls

Borderlands is highly engaging and addictive. Farm, shoot, save. Farm, shoot, save.

More later."
8206,"I liked this game. 

The story it's alright, the DLCS show you story a bit better than the main campain. 
Each character has different habilities. 
A lot of guns. 

Gameplay it's fun, specially with friends."

"
8208,Shoot n loot co-op FPS-RPG. Best way to describe it. This is the game that put Borderlands on the map. Play the original game that started it all!
8209,"Simplistic, a hub-based mission grinder. Gameplay is solid and fun. A must to play Borderlands 2 and Prequel. It keeps getting better from here."
8210,"I tried really hard to enjoy this, but I am a fan of more linear shooters. I'm still playing through it and will eventually get to Borderlands 2, which I also own. Overall, it's all right. The game feels like a chore. Managing items in your backpack gets old fast and the game keeps generating new weapons as you keep finding loot. The idea is great, but in practice it just requires a lot of work to keep your inventory clean and up-to-date with the new challenges that will inevitably be thrown at you as you progress through the story. It's really challenging and often feels like a tedious repetitive mess. Traveling around the world could be heavily improved upon.

But if you like massive open worlds, level progression and LOTS of inventory management, you may enjoy this."
8211,"I love this game, mostly because of the masher... the most OP revolver ever."
8212,"The more I have played this game, the more I've liked it.

PS: it's highly recommendable getting the GOTY since it adds loads of missions to the game. I firstly passed the base game without DLCs in about 12hours tho' (investigating all and playing slowly)."
8213,"A must have for those that like playing with friends. With the closure of Gamespy, the multiplayer aspect of the games was thought to be lost forever, but thanks to steamworks Borderlands has been given a second life.

The game itself is lots of fun even if you play solo, but the multiplayer is where you will find that Borderlands shines the brightest!"
8214,"Great game,with the best dlc's created for a game ever.Spawned an amazing series as well,and if you enjoyed BL 2 not only for it's gameplay,try this one too."
8215,superb!
8216,"Explosive Fisting has never been better.

Brick/Brick"
8217,"A very fun fps rpg that pits you against an asortment of unique characters. Borderlands in itself is okay at best, but the feeling when you play Borderalnds is what makes it so popular. The game is big enough that a review is unneccesary, but in case you missed the hype behind it all, just know that its a bit of a slow start, followed by a pretty grand adventure. I recommend highly that you play with friends."
8218,fun to play when nothing to do
8219,10/10 Would Salt the Wound !
8220,This game is awesome
8221,no.. boring..
8222,"Nothing but repeating glitches for hours, getting stuck in walls and quest objects disappearing, it was very dissapointing and frustrating."
8223,"What can you say about Borderlands? The game has hours on gameplay and fun tactics with plenty of different weapons and variety of different quests. When I played the game, I played as Roland and his turret was really good to fight with and I felt like a could stand a chance even when I was doing a mission that was above my level. The only downside i would give the game is the lack of intense story constantly reminding you to do stuff but the fact that there is a wide variety of colorful characters going along with your journey makes it that much more interesting. The world is very expansive and has plenty of missions to do so over all i would give it an 8/10 because it has a really nice charm and really fun and addicting gameplay."
8224,"Best game ever, we need more Multiplayer games like this one!"
8225,"It was good, but the second one is just straight better."
8226,One of my favorite games. Not just because of the gameplay but also the story.
8227,A very good FPS RPG. Can get boring in some parts. Definately worth a playthrough.
8228,[b]A loot of fun![/b]
8229,"A proper classic, 10/10"
8230,In my Top 10  best games ever
8231,Great FPS with rpg elements. A Classic
8232,AMAZZIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING
8233,"My all time Favourite game still holds up very well. Decent lenght game with great DLC's & atleast played this game over 1,600 hours on the Xbox 360! The great thing about the steam version is you can add custom gear items to the game, which make the game last a lot longer to its life cycle"
8234,totally worth it
8235,Great game  I love it. Must buy great for friends
8236,"Borderlands 

The best fps/rpg game out there with such in-depth story, humor that i`ve ever seen. The story from beggining makes you get into it with such amazing graphical and humoristic way that noother game has. The song`s are implemented soo well into the game story and funny dialouges. It`s one of a kind game that after completing it few times you won`t get bored playing it again,and again.  The skill tree making it that you can have few builds makes the experimenting and studying the fight more interesting. Fight`s it self are totally different story,from kicking your enemyes too blowin them up,running over with vehicles one word-AMAZING. Loot system and such big variety of weapons makes happy even the most demanding hoarders and collectionist. Also good and maybe the best thing is the multiplayer guys, playing with ur friends and blowing up enemy`s accross the pandora wasteland. 

Overall: for a game from 2009 the graphic is just mind-blowing,the music is oustanding,humor and fighting never seen in other fps games like in this one. That`s why I strongly recommend you MUST play this game if you like anykind of rpg/fps games."
8237,For 2009 game it was Good. 2015 to lame game
8238,"Borderlands is a very unique game with a very funny and well thought out storyline. The characters are memorable and the landscape across Pandora has its own special feeling.

Driving the runners feels great how smooth it glides across the terrain and the infinite guns gives it a diablo feeling of loot progression. 

One of my favorite aspects of this game is the New Game + system where you can play the game a second time with renamed enemies who are much tougher than before, which turns what used to be easy missions into a nightmare.

The DLC is fun and rewarding even though Mad Moxxi TD can be very tedious. As a game I own three copies for and have beat over a dozen times I have to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fps/rpg elements with a funny and progressive storyline.

I give it an 8.5 out of ten for replability, story, and great gameplay that will keep you playing for hours."
8239,"This was just a really great. It provided a lot of hours of good old fashioned FPS'ing fun. Unfortunately the sequels were never able to live up to this first installment. If you tried playing one of the later sequels and have not tried this one, this is the borderlands to play. Unlike the later games, the original borderlands is not as much of a repetitive grind to get guns. The grinding for gear formula is for online MMOs not a platform game. This is where the later installments went wrong. Where this one gets it right is enough challenge to get good equipment without boring you will endless hours of doing the same thing. Some people will counter this by suggesting mod'ing the game. Why the heck play it then?"
8240,FPS with RPG elements? SOLD!
8241,really fun i enjoy it alot
8242,allah
8243,Buy the enhanced edition instead.
8244,"Borderlands leaves me with mixed feelings. I had a great time playing it – when I wasn't bored by endless fetch-quests, easy combat and (in the DLC) re-used bosses.

I enjoyed the weapons the most. They feel and fire great, with a lot of variety. There's a finite amount of cash, so most of your weapons will be found via looting. And there is a TON of stuff to loot. Any fallen enemy drops loot, from bandits to wild animals. And if you find a stash, well, you just might land yourself a rare. Sniper rifles have a fixed zoom, though. 

The game world is huge and drab; a real wasteland. The visual style is still unique (even with Telltale using a similar hand-drawn, cell-shaded look for most of their games). It was a little jarring at first, but after a few hours I found the graphics very appealing. And light on system resources. I am able to run Borderlands at max settings @1440p on an R7 260X! Borderlands is just not that demanding.

Getting around the huge world isn't a problem; Scooter's vehicle terminals are everywhere, making it very easy to “Git you one!” But why are we traversing the gameworld? Fetch-quests, mostly. “Bring me 20 fish!” “Destroy 3 fuel tanks!” “Find 20 parts!” They're not all fetch-quests, of course, but there's quite a bit of padding. The attraction was supposed to lie in the combat (and looting) while completing the quests. Which is fine, except the combat is easy. If you do a few side-quests and suddenly find yourself 2 or more levels higher than recommended, you'll breeze through the missions. Co-op play is supposed to mean harder enemies and better loot; I found co-op even easier.

I'd heard so much about how good the characters of Borderlands are, and they're there, but barely; the characters are the start- and end-points of the missions, but that's it. You'll barely even see a cut-scene with them (except in some of the DLC). Claptraps are everywhere, and they're obviously designed to be cute. What about the story? Well, you're looking for a vault; think of it as a box. You're on a planet named “Pandora”. Put the two together, and hopefully you won't be too disappointed when you finally get to the vault after an endless level of “guardians”. 

So, I have mixed feelings about Borderlands. I found it tremendously fun in co-op, though, so if you have a few friends who want to run around together shooting and looting, grab it by all means. If you're planning to solo most of it, it will be a solitary, easy grind for loot. Not a bad thing if that's what you're looking for; if you were hoping for more, though, you'll be disappointed.

""Wait, you forgot about your reference to 'recycled bosses'!""

Read on.

On DLC:
There are four DLC, all of them substantial additions to the main game; campaigns are large (as are the rewards) and well worth the purchase – especially if you're buying the game for its co-op.

Some problems with the DLC, though:
- No fast travel. Wait, wtf? That's right. You fast travel to the start of the DLC campaign, but within the DLC, there is no fast-travel, meaning you'll spend a lot of time running (or driving). If you pass a save-point deep within a level, and quit your game, the next time you load your save, you'll be back at the beginning of the DLC, and have to run / drive all the way back to where you were when you saved. 
- RECYCLED BOSSES. You'll re-fight the boss from the main campaign, and in the Claptrap Robot Revolution DLC, you'll also re-fight the bosses from The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned and The Secret Armory of General Knoxx – sometimes even multiple times! Borderlands tries to be self-deprecating as it does this, but it doesn't change the fact that they're re-using assets. It reeks of being cheap. Did the devs seriously think we would swallow the EXACT same boss three times without complaining? Come on.

Get the GOTY edition. When on sale, it's only a few dollars more, and it includes everything."
8245,"Best game ever. Best atmosphere ever. Best guns ever. Don't read this any longer, just play it and... Catch a Riiiiiiiiiiide!"
8246,"Great game, but it is a little narrow.  Melee exists, but isn't a useful option.  Same with the non-grenade explosives."
8247,"Took me 53 hours to get all the achievements. (ALL OF THEM) Whilst constantly screaming 'STRIP THE FLESH, SALT THE WOUND' 10/10"
8248,"If you're here wondering if you should either start at the first one or wanting to come back to play this, yes. Not as meme-y or whacky, this is the best one in my opinion because it went the route Saint's Row did and stopped taking itself seriously because it sold more copies. Play this one."
8249,"""I'm Fats Waller, and this is my favorite game on Steam."""
8250,✔ OK
8251,"I've never been one for nostalgia. Plain and simple really. In fact, there are literally only a handful of games I'd willingly replay in their original entirety. And Borderlands is one of them. 

Around 2011 I got in a near-fatal accident I'm STILL recovering from physically. My whole world flipped upside-down and I stopped talking to most people I knew after. Even the people I did know...I started to slowly float away from. 

To say Borderlands was an escape is an understatement.

Games these days are insecure. They have drawn out tutorials, boring or complicated UI, and to be honest...not usually worth a second playthrough. Can't say any of that about BL. The one thing I love most about this game is the atomsphere. You're doing your thing, but you don't really feel like everything is about YOU. Moreso, you're a part of this huge world and you're able to explore it. The writing...oh my goodness...moar. now.

I can't really finish this review because all I'll do is gush. Get this game. Game of the year edition. Play it with headphones and get rid of distractions. You won't regret it.

Now if you'll excuse me...I'm gonna re-download this for the 7th time ;)"
8252,"Bought this game on sale along with Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel. Some of the best spent 5 dollars ever. Even if you're buying this for the standard price, definitely worth it. A very fun game with the FPS and RPG mix. Played this game alone for a while, but it's almost 10x better with co-op. Fun game, cool story, and I'm definitely going to buy the DLC for even more fun.

10/10 very fun game"
8253,incredible....
8254,I don't remember why but I cried because of this game I think there was some sycological metaphor that made me realize I am just a pawn in society and that in 80 years no one will remember me ;--------------------------------------;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8255,"It's a good game, but it can become repetitive. Then again, I can say the same for any game, really."
8256,"Awesome game.
Loads of replayability."
8257,The unit CL4P-TP (claptrap) is better than R2-D2 (arturito)
8258,Good Game. That's all I can say.
8259,"I don`t even own it.

11/10."
8260,"Good game. Not as good as Borderlands 2, but you gotta start somewhere."
8261,great game
8262,Ive played and completed this game countless times on console. and i can never get bored of it. kills countless hours.
8263,"Played this previously on my xbox, always thought it was overated, but still an enjoyable experience."
8264,"[i]Review partially based off of two pre-Steam playthroughs.[/i]

While clunky and dated compared to its superior, precision-streamlined successor, [i]Borderlands[/i] still stands strong as a solid FPS with light RPG mechanics thanks to its fabulous gameworld and bizarre, randomly generated weaponry; it may not be perfect, but well worth a revisiting if time permits."
8265,"Great game, but trivial compared to Borderlands 2 and the pre-sequel, play those instead if you so wish."
8266,This game is great it has a great story line with unexpected twists and cool features like fast travel that you cant use in the DLC's :(
8267,"While being a good introduction, what the game does well:
-guns
-lvl 1 customization 
-Interesting characters to report to
-Claptrap

If you want a SHOOTER-rpg then this is it for you

If not, try the sequel"
8268,This game is so fun to play and you shud git it
8269,"I like the story, gameplay, and the loot."
8270,"This was one of my 1er game i played. This game is great! There more than 10 000 000 000 guns!!! I like the story, the guns, the missions, the DLCs, etc.... I give this game a 100% 10/10 <3 <3 <3 <3"
8271,"the graffic of this game is unusual in all game that i've ever play, the game was fun but sometimes scares me especially in a dark place with a low level (LOL), so i recommend this game to play for you who want something different in a first-person shooting adventure"
8272,"someone still playing this then add me so we can kick some asses together!!!
this game is AWESOME!!!"
8273,Fun game when it come out it had a fresh like take on shooters with billions of weapons its a loot fest. Some fun dialog and you have  a winner. The second and the pre squalls are way better but this game sure is fun.
8274,"Shotgun Revolvers? Check.

Rocket-Shooting Shotguns? Check.

Headshot-Explosion of Epic Gore??? Double Check.

10/10 Would armory glitch again"
8275,Do not try to play this game on it's own. You need a friend or two to really enjoy this. I played this entire game on my own and found it very dry and abandoned feeling. Didn't realize I could matchmake with others. Damnit.
8276,solid shooter rpg
8277,much more fun that it should be
8278,"A very good game with adequately balanced loot progression.
A well told story that definitely immerses the player within the wasteland of a world."
8279,Great game
8280,21 hours on record just baerly scratched the surface of the story and not board of it at all
8281,10/10
8282,"Due to  some minor, and one very major, annoyances cannot recommend this game. It would be really great, if not for the disgusting 90's console savepoint system.

Regardless how far you have advanced in a map, as soon as you log out you have to restart from the last ""Outpost"" - not the last auto-savepoint. This super-sucks in the DLCs, where there is only one ""Outpost"", and whenever you login again you'll have to walk - and fight - stupidly long distances over and over again. This gets pretty repetitive and tiresome over time, greatly reducing the fun you'd otherwise have.

Still a good game for its age, just not a ""leave for lunch and pick up where you left"" type of game.

I really don't understand why those crappy and outdated savepoint systems are still implemented in so many games."
8283,"The core gameplay is good, I enjoy the character trees, and the variety each character brings to the table. However, after an hour or so the game begins to get really dull and repeative, and all of the quests follow the mmo trend of being big walls of text to read. The quest structure leads to burn out as well, and makes the game feel to grindy, more cutscenes or dialogue would have went along way in my opinion. 
now that the general statements are out of the way

Gameplay: Great feels pretty fun with or without friends, and each character has their own unique abilities which adds depth.
Story: Not Call of Duty levels of bad, I just feel like It needed slightly more engaging implementation.
Ai: Fairly Standard, however they can get stuck, and or simple to deal with.
NPC's : You cannot tell me that claptrap did not give you a single headache while playing the game. overal you will not find yourself getting to attached to the npcs with the possible exception of TK 
World: it is pretty big just a bit samey
Enemies: good enemy variety as far as different types of enemies goes, however the human enemies are largely the same just different varients.

Overall Score: 6/10 

It is not a bad game, I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys shooters. However, it does have its faults that pile down pretty hard."
8284,That freaking Pyscho's smile....is driving me.....cra...zy @@ 😵
8285,"The original, still the second best game in the series. 

Except the end boss, that was a major major disappointment (you sneaky bastards)"
8286,"7/10 - Still fun, impressive game!

Still a pretty great game. Loved the unique graphics and fluid gameplay. Looking forward to the followup games. Grab on sale if you can. Wouldn't pay full price.

Worth $10-15

8287,Borderlands 1 for me brought me into a humorous world of guns and tons of enemies to shoot at with said guns. The blend of fps with rpg is fun and addicting. My hours on steam pale in comparrison to the hours I have on Xbox 360. Playing this game in co-op just amplified that fun. The replayability of the game is really high with it's randomly generated loot system and dlc's that will take you a while to finish. Even after I finished the game I felt like playing more with the other classes or just starting new games with friends on their first time playing and the game is still enjoyable. Every now and again I find myself replaying the Borderlands series with or without friends and it just never gets old to me. I highly recommend for fps gamers to pick up this game. If you find it on sale pick up a few copies for you and your friends and have a co-op adventure like none other.
8288,"It is highly addictive. I have never thought that running and shooting sniper riffle can bring so much fun and satisfaction. Great atmosphere, world, music, sights, scenery, humor, graphics.
It has minor cons:
- your car sometimes get stuck in weird places
- sometimes you get stuck on weird places
- I have teleported myself into driver's seat of the vehicle far far away :/ Beware :D
- P2P multiplayer nad co-op (need superior Internet connection for server) (Do authors want LAN parties back?)
\GJ"
8289,"Even if the graphics are weird (not negatively), the game is great, we have a feeling of progression and there is plenty of missions to keep you busy for long."
8290,Amazing game. I have never played such an innovative game.
8291,"One of the all time best games ive ever played!
Has an emense range of different weapons you can loot from bosses or just around the map, huge map and tonnes of things to do its a one of a kind game! 

This is the game for when you want to just chill with a couple of friends and try and farm crawmerax or glitch into a huge weapon loot room with enough weapons to ... idk what i was going to say but this game is seriously something!"
8292,I have always loved this game.
8293,Great open world first person shooter. Unique random weapons system. Story doesn't take itself too seriously.
8294,So many cool and original things here. Guns galore and co op killing!
8295,"if you fucking son of a bitch haters thinks this game is a peice of shit why dont you make your own fucking shit ass game thats better than it fuck you haters!!!!!!!!! 

great game 10/10 :)"
8296,"If you wanted to play a game about killing people in a desert distopia, I'd recommend Mad Max. Same feeling, none of being bored in a desert."
8297,"The game is amazing, alos has coop!

No issues with the game with 3/h in!

Very much recommended!"
8298,"This game is fun... i tellya its amazing.

when u first vieew it u might say (ohh crappy graphics) or (ahh old game its bad) then no ur stupid

this game proves to all that real gameplay isnt about graphics or age, its about being fun

perhaps the only thing that makes it a bit bad is the story (its shit) however if u keep on playing the game ull forget there is a story (like it needs one) and if ur a guy that want story and shit like that... then i suggest u go to borderlands 2 

play that shit and ull be amazed"
8299,"TL;DR too much walking, not enough enemies, not enough guns, bad aiming

There are many flaws in Borderlands which stop it from being a really good game. I mean, a really fun and good game. It feels like a good concept for a game built on a pillar of call of duty gameplay; the game is a bad hybrid of modern shooter ""gameplay"" (if you can even call it that) and actually fun oldschool arcade gameplay. Quite simply, you can tell that there is not much talent behind the creaters behind this. They just got lucky and made a somewhat fun game.

The level design of this game is quite bad. The game is very slow in its introduction to start becoming fun. You do not have your ability until level 5, and the guns are very much basic ones. The dungeons are all more or less the same. At least they had the decency in many dungeons, to design shortcuts from the end of the dungeon to the beginning. Then there's walking. there is walking and walking from point A to B (and no, this ""sprinting"" is no sprint. Call me back when the character is as fast as doomguy). This is okay on maps where there are vehicles; on maps without them, it's a huge pain. Honestly I have spent more time in this game walking from point A to B then fighting. The setting is made by many levels and semi-hubs. You go to one town, which has 3 dungeons or enemy areas on the outskirts of its map. You do typical chores, or I'm sorry, ""missions"" like killing 10 chickens in this that dungeon and collecting this that artifacts of an ancient civilization 1000 years ago (original story, do not steal). Sounds familiar, right? Now, borderlands makes this fun by having crazy loads of weapons and crazy loads of enemies. Or so it tries.

There is no 67 bajillion guns. There's several models for the base, handle, scope, and other accessories for each type of gun, and different colors for each model. These parts are randomly placed together, with randomly generated stats. Now this is totally fine if there were many models for each of the above. But there isn't, that's the thing. After a while, you notice the trends in the gun models and notice that you get the same gun over and over, just with slightly different numbers. Also, the difference in the guns are somewhat superficial. There are guns which reload faster, zoom more, fire faster, have more accuracy, and have more ammunition per magazine. Pretty boring right? But then, there's possible elemental effects for each type of gun, possibility of the gun acting like other types of guns (shotguns which fire rockets, revolvers with shells etc). It leads into something that could be exciting, but then it stops there. The are only so many REALLY crazy guns, like the TK's wave shotgun where the bullets bounce from the ground... and I can't remember any more. There isn't shit like in painkiller where you shoot lightning and shurikens. Hell, there isn't even miniguns in this game! It's like as if this game was designed by people who only ever played call of duty and Wowt. What about sniper rifles which shoot tornadoes with swords slashing inside them? What about shotguns which shoot slimes onto enemies which can poison others? Why aren't there rocket launchers which shoot moais that get bigger as they get damage until they finally explode? 

As you would imagine, the amazing 67 gajillion guns play worse than call of duty. Rubbish hip fire and iron sights. The only valid guns from a distance, if you want critical hits, are those with 95+ accuracy. There's also this really annoying thing where you lose your aim when you get shot, so you cant pick off headshots with a sniper rifle or revolver because every time you try doing so, the aim in iron sights randomly goes upwards. Not to mention, the bullet lag is ridiculous. It doesn't help that the AI is complete garbage and ALWAYS knows where you are, so there's no flanking (unless you use your special ability, but that's less fun). The only valid weapons are high-repeating ones, but maybe this is because I played as soldier. Also, gainig experience in guns can ruin the game if you get too much experience in one gun, because every other gun type starts to feel pointless. If you get an accurate assault rifle, with assault rifle perks and skills, that's it. You main that gun forever. Did I also mention that the guns sound and feel like they are plastic?

There is not much enemy variety at all. There are people, which range from psychos, midgets, normal ones, and armored ones. Each have interesting ways in which they fight against you. Psychos are melee only so you can prioritize killing them later, which is thrilling because you have to judge when you have to kill this axe wielding madman, who is right in front of you, compared to the man in the distance who is shooting you. Midgest are mostly comic relief, but you need to be careful because they can escape your line of sight. The armored ones require you to aim outside of their shield, or may even require headshots (if I recall). The headshot for skags is when they open their mouths, while for those bug things it's their jelly backs. There isn't much way of defending against enemy attacks, however. It's a matter on how fast you can kill them with how much you can aim for their heads. Also, there aren't that many enemies at once. It would be really fun if the game played like serious sam where there are a shitload of enemies and you have to move in order to attack them. You are too slow to dodge anything in Borderlands. You can't hide behind cover because the enemies always know where you are. So you simply go backwards, distancing youself from the enemy, and you try to kill the enemy first. The few enemies are fairly fun to play against. But you will kill, thousands upon thousands of the same guys over and over again, to the point where it's boring. 
On another note, I have to say that you will laugh your ass off at midgets. Also, the second wind mechanic is great. By keeping a low health enemy near you as you nearly die, you can essentially never die in this game. It's some fun, basic strategy.

I can't comment on the balance of the characters, but Berserker has a really boring ability. Soldier's turret is alright. It's kind of superficial though. I guess you are supposed to pick characters on what kind of gameplay you like, but you are stuck with that for that entire game. You can't switch classes for the same build. 

The DLC's mess up the balance of the game, because it was made so that you start playthrough 2 of the original game straight after playthrough 1. But if you play through the DLC's playthrough 1, you start playthrough 2 being too powerful, killing the pace of the game.

The optimization is terrible. I get FPS slowdowns when there are many objects in the viewing distance, on my computer which has an i7 and a GTX 760. 

The music is very minimal. The music by elephant in the cage, in the beginning, is the highlight of the musical composition in this game. 

No comment on the graphics.

The game is mighty fun when you are blowing up loads and loads of enemies in the face with a superfast submachine gun or shotgun that has flammable bullets, and just mowing those bullet sponges down. No really, it's actually damn fun, even when you are alone. It's even more fun with friends (then again everything is more fun with friends). There's just a lot of walking inbetween, with no ability to aim accurately from a distance. I want to blast things close up in the face while at the same time picking off headshots with my sniper rifle from hip fire.

I can only recommend this game to you if you like loot, guns, comic art, and RPG's like I do. Otherwise, stay away form this game."
8300,This is one of the best game ever
8301,"This game is awesome, the gameplay is awesome, Ive been playingt this game for about 2 years because i cant stop playing it, 100% recommended by me : DankGod."
8302,"Back in the day I played this game on the xbox 360 for a whole summer. My brothers and I secluded in a small 2-story condo beat the shit out of this game. I never did buy the DLC back then and wish I did. I bought this purely because of respect I have for the game and how I plan on replaying with the DLC. Its a really classic game, get it on sale if you can wait."
8303,10/10 Would recommend.
8304,Amazin co-op
8305,Good game nice co-op action! 7.5/10
8306,"The gamplay itself isn't bad, but the random weapon generation is kind of annoying. It sounded like a great concept, though. I can understand the appeal of an FPS with more overt RPGish mechanics, but it's not my kind of game. The only reason why I spent so much time playing it was because I got tired of how grindy it felt, so I quit, then started over again with a different character. I thought maybe my boredom came from not being into the play style of the particular character, but that wasn't the case."
8307,"One of the first open world games i ever played, and it was multiplayer."
8308,"A nice shooter with an entertaining coop mode, cool weapon combinations but annoying AI."
8309,"Definitely one of the best games I've played. Barely anything bad about that game except maybe 4 players is a bit too easy. Difficulty should be higher for 4 player. Except for that, awesome game. Literally YEARS of fun since I'v benn playing this game for more than 5 years now."
8310,Great game so much humor and great comic book style terrein and and surroundings and most of all who doesnt like a robot with personality that turns out to be crazy
8311,"can anyone help me and tell me how to use the scorpio weps
"
8312,"Where it all started.

Party games are great, but they do require friends. You don't nessesarily need 3 others to join you for this but that's where you get the most fun from the whole Borderlands franchise. You can play this solo just fine but it would probably get pretty tedious. 

That said...

What else is there to say about this game? It took Diablo's procedurally generated loot and slapped it together with a first person shooter and.... it turns out that's pretty great. Toss in a pinch of story and simmer gently. It was clear they were going with some very basic stuff here and that's all it takes to make a legendary game. Most people don't need ground breaking super amazing new stuff in games, they just want a little polish on what they know and love. It avoids the graphics being bad by everything being intentionally cartoony. It has a heavy pulse hitting soundtrack. You get to shoot tons and tons of things in a psycho desert planet future world. 

If you don't like these things you are wrong about everything. Go sit in the box of shame and think about your life up to this point. Good day sir.

I believe I said [b]good day[/b], sir."
8313,Great game. make sure you get all the original DLC. fantastic.
8314,"In my opinion, this is one the must own games on PC. It combines the loot dropping mechanics from Diablo with a cell shaded aesthetic thats makes it look good even in 2015. You should definately buy this game."
8315,This FPS with RPG elements works like a CHARM.  Diablo-esque in looting and items.  So fun!  Multiplayer works great.
8316,"I got 27 hrs registered but I had to play offline for a while, I have spent probably 100+ hours, I have 1 character at max level (out of 4) and beaten the game 3 times, DLCs included. 
Cell Shading~ish graphics, tons of missions, huge map and nice smooth gunplay. Nice for playing with friends, very enjoyable in single player. 
The history is not so great (in Borderlands 2 is amazing) but is a lot of fun, specially giving out explosive blows with your bare hands as the berserker. Dont pick the Siren, SMGs sucks. 
8/10."
8317,The best thing about Borderlands is the shooting... if you're not into shooting stuff in the face you should really leave this game alone!
8318,"[h1]First thoughts[/h1]

Borderlands was one of my favorite games as a child, And thats the main reason i bought it. When i was little the game seemed to fun to play. I had lots of things to explore and do and the blood and gore of it was great. My first thoughts of it was ""Wow that is like.. SWEET!""..But soon did things change..

[h1]What changed?[/h1]

Once i bought it years later i realize the game is not as fun and big as i thought as a child, Everything felt a little different. The game was still very very fun and i would still play it. If everything did not feel so repetitive. Quests for each playable class are the same and everything feels the same.

[h1]What about graphics?[/h1]

Graphics on this game are pretty good, But not the best. This game was made in 2009 on the unreal engine 3, The game runs very well on old laptops or desktops and does not use alot of power. The textures could of been better though. The fading so close to a player with max graphics are pretty sad. Towers or rocks that are far away seem to have a blur to them and don't look very sharp. Besides that textures are very nice and sharp upclose and the cartoon blacklined theme is very nice and no one can forget those graphics.

[h1]Controls?[/h1]

Controls are very easy, The game helps you though the entire control system and makes sure you will be able to play the game. I only use the shoot button and ""W A S D"" In borderlands half the time. 

[h1]So what are your final thoughts?[/h1]

My final thoughts on this game is pretty good. The game is overall well made and fun for a person looking for a game you could sink over 100 hours in, If of course your willing to try other classes and do the same quests over again. I love the game. Its old but gold type deal here. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes blood and funny things, This game is filled with little dirty jokes and some tits, The textures should have been a little better and make a little sharper, Controls are very well mapped. The only thing i dislike is the FOV, The FOV feels very pushed in and you can not change that in the settings.

[h1]Overall?[/h1]

Get this game. Amazing game, Try and wait for a sale though! :)
[b]8/10[/b]"
8319,Quite Fun to play if play with some friends :)
8320,2 gud 4 u
8321,"First Person Shooter meets RPG meets Dukes of Hazards on speed.  

This game is nothing but fun.  Humorous villians, over the top dialogues, fun yet challenging cell shaded world to explore and destroy.

If you are into any of the things above, you will love this game."
8322,"This game is so much better on PC, I'm glad I bought it and replayed. Favorite game! :^) 10/10"
8323,Best Game Ever!!!!
8324,"[h1] Keep In Mind I made this review and failed to post this WAY back in 2009. And I had it for ps3. [/h1]

So I buy this game. I look at it and think; I have better things to be buying.
Plays for 8 hours straight. Regrets nothing. (""Just gotta shoot some more!!!!!!"")
And Nuff said. Beats campaign/story/whatever you wanna call it (after I keep obsessively playing, my friends are gone). I want a sequel.


Also my friend won't get it. I'm sed."
8325,Great way to kill some time but that's about it
8326,Its basically fallout 3 with guns. Oh wait...... MORE GUNS.
8327,"While all 3 Borderlands games are good (BL, BL2 and BL, the Pre-Sequel), I must say, I enjoy the character set from the original Borderlands the best.  The skills and abilities each character has is fitting, and each can provide benefits to both single player as well as multi-player games, which is something that can't be said for all characters in the other games (Thinking about Zero from BL2 specifically in single player).  I'd say this is easily the 2nd best of the 3 games, but it's a very close 2nd place."
8328,Best Borderlands.  Pls Linux port.
8329,How many hours have I spent trying to farm.
8330,"Pretty fun....but it's just killing and looting...with some comedy....in a sense, it's like destiny or more like destiny is like borderlands

it's a good way to kill time :D"
8331,"Great blend of FPS and RPG genres with an interesting setting, but the story isn't too great."
8332,"Definitely one of the best Co-op games! Really enjoyed it, the graphics are very clean and I love those little Clap Traps."
8333,"The game is very fun and entertaining. If you play alone, it can be a fun and good game, if you play CO-OP, it can be a whacky and crazy experience. There are some flaws with it, the loot wars anytime a chest has a good piece of loot, the graphics that can glitch out at some points or textures that can just go crazy for no reason, and the difficulty spike for people who play CO-OP and don't know what they're doing. I started playing the game CO-OP from the first moment and it was ""borderline impossible"" (pun totally intended) to play, until I played solo one day and got half of the game done in 6 hours. 

Was it fun? Yes. Was it enjoyable? Yes. Should you buy it? Yes."
8334,"Didn't think I'd like this game at first, but collecting loot turned out to be very addictive (hehe).  Turned out I like this style of game play so much I own all 3 of the Borderlands games."
8335,Good
8336,"Awesome COOP game, a lot of fun. If It's on sale, get it!"
8337,its good if you like feeling like youre up close to the screen
8338,VERY FUN
8339,"The idea of a loot em up was appealing to me and Borderlands is great fun for that. I honestly would have played this more, but then I got Borderlands 2 which is a better game overall. If you don't have any Borderlands games and what to start, then start here and then go on to 2. Things in 2 will make more sense if you've ran through this one first."
8340,"This is it!!!

Loved  this game from beginning....Even the fact that this game is from 2009 and I play game in 2015 make me nervous that I miss this game somehow few years ago...
-Advanced weapon generation system which can make many different variants of same gun...
-Incredible detailed world in compare even to BL2:everywhere are posters,many texts,nice signs like ""trouble"" with arrow to boss lair and many many others - propably one of most deatailed worlds I see in all my gaming experience since 1995
-Lot of chests and many of them with a legendary wepaons inside- perfect legendary drop rate
-Knoxx loot chamber :))
-Much better gameplay than BL2

If you miss somehow this game as I shes worth playing even after years...Graphics is not so bad even after few years passed..Although age is still in the game you'll see a lot of beautiful landscapes and interesting bosses- is a sight to behold at times...Fully recommended - you should PLAY this game if you like both FPS/RPG games...

The perfect combination and balance all aspects gameplay.Authors beyond the extremely detailed world have thought of just about everything what I've learned myself during the game."
8341,"Borderlands is a fantastic game. The graphics are unique, the story is well done, and you get a sense of accomplishment when you beat it. It's fun if you like RPGs and shooters and it well deserves the credit it has gotten. I'm giving this game 9/10."
8342,its like a gun simulator without memes
8343,"+atmo
+music
+adventure
+weapons
+fun"
8344,"Not as good as Borderlands 2, but this one has it's moments."
8345,This game is amazing.  Borderlands 2 is awesome.  Get both and play them.
8346,"The original. A fun and unique post-apocolyptic gaming experience. One of the more original action oriented roleplying experiences ever made. A must buy at its current price.

8.5/10"
8347,Get this game.
8348,"Absolutely good game! However, I was tired of the long walks. This has been changed in Borderlands Pre-Sequel.

I'm a Linux user so I used wine to run this game and I must say it was a Royal pain in the butt to start it. 

The second and the Pre-Sequel is available on Linux, and they are in facet using the same engine as this one, so don't understand why hasn't been compiled to Linux yet. Truly, I'd play it again.   

Overall, I must say that I had a lot of fun playing this game apart from the long walk. Would recommend it to anybody over 18. Things could get nasty and bloody. 

Watch out for missions in missions, otherwise will not actually finish the game. All missions have little missions within. For example, in one of the mission, I had to kill 50 bandits as extra. This has nothing to do with achievements. If you don't do these, missions still going to be marked as finnish at the end if the main task is complete. 

Also, it's a good value for money as it is actually quite a long game."
8349,"Very immersive setting and storyline. Easy gameplay to pick up without being overly simplistic or limiting. In general, just downright fun to play."
8350,"Played on ps3 when it first came out, loved it and complete it numerous times :) would reccomend to a friend :P"
8351,This game is fantastic. I have only played about 2 hours of it but its amazing. The enviroments are so imercive and its easy to run (at least on my pc). Plus! It's $5! Buy this amazing game now and you will appreciate this review.
8352,great
8353,"The story is relatively original. The graphics are fresh for the time. The gameplay is exciting and immerseful. All-in-all Borderlands is definitely a must play for any open-world FPS gamer. Enemies remain challenging throughout the game, and end-game content can be continued beyond the end credits through the first playthrough. 

Honestly, the game isn't perfect. You are very limited in how open the world really is, being restriced from jumping onto most rocks, and locked into certain zones. Much of the games content takes place in what most open world gamers would call ""dungeons"", which limit the open feeling of an open world shooter. Also, while enemies remain challenging through the course of the game, fights remain the same as well. You can quickly find yourself becoming bored with the game and losing interest with the constant point and shoot mentality. 

In short, this game is worth a pickup if on sale, because it's a great experience to say the least."
8354,best two player game that i ever got into maybe still the best one out there
8355,"I owned the game on console back when it first came out and i now own it trough steam. Over 100hrs on console and this is a great series to get into starting from the first. 

10/10 for the game itself
10/10 for DLC: Dr.Ned's zombie Island
10/10 for DLC: General Knoxx's secert armory
9/10 for DLC: Mad Moxxis's underdome
9/10 for DLC: Claptrap's Robolution"
8356,9 dick jokes/ 10 dick jokes
8357,"I jump in for an hour to shoot me some psychos.
Four hours later...

This game! This bloody game! I never really liked shooters until I started playing that!
To be fair though, calling it a shooter would be like saying Bohemian Rhapsody has a nice drum beat. That's barely scratching the surface. The integration of RPG-like character development and Diablo-esque drop (a little too Diablo-esque, to be fair) into the sheer madness of shooting, smashing, blasting and bombarding is what keeps you progressing through the game. The story is fairly interesting, though for me it remained in the background for the most part, really, dimmed slightly by the amazing world of Pandora and its inhabitants. A good excuse for shooting insane mutant humanoids though, what more would you need, really? And a very humorous at that. :D
And the graphics. Oh, the graphics. Don't even get me started on the grapics. I love it.
I have yet to try the DLCs and the subsequent playthroughs, co-op is also worth giving a shot, but thus far my impression of this game is that it's bloody brilliant.

Oh, and the popculture references.
So many of them. 8D"
8358,Brilliant! One of the few games that i really enjoy the most.
8359,"The very least that I can say for this game is that it is fun to play alone, but a total blast to play with friends, or even complete strangers, because the game rewards cooperation instead of competition. If you haven't tried the series, now would be the time to fix that."
8360,"I've played this game much, much more on consoles. Personally, I thought this one was better than its successor."
8361,"It is a perfect game especially playing together with friends. If you want a good coop, this is what you're looking for. It is also a proof of an FPS can be one of the best RPGs as well."
8362,"Just dumb fun for the most part. But if you do play this game, just make sure that you completely stop playing when the game tells you to go after steele. Literally stop and have the vault's contents remain ambiguious. 31 hours gone all because  of the worst game ending I've ever played. But the game doesn't even end it just stops, leaving all your questions unanswered and nothing making sense. It was going to be a 7/10, but with the ending, it more deserves a 5/10. -_-"
8363,The begining of the fabulous Borderlands series; still an excellent game!
8364,"Love it!

I pretty much know this game by heart more or less
(i dont have many hours on steam but i have beaten it too many times that i care to count before i used steam and its amazing still)

-so many weapons its crazy (so little backpack space )
-skill tree is fun to swap around and change your skills and thus changing the gameplay
-you can play the game over and over and gat a different experience every time ( just so many choices with the  weapons skills and abilities)
-treasures galore
-monsters, raiders, and more (and zombies in the dlc)
 
it's an addictively fun shooter where it has you finishing quests and looking for the best loot!

in all this game will always remain on my loved games list its really is a beauty and I recommend 100 percent

-Goombas

p.s adjusting the gavity is pretty fun ( and backpack space lol)"
8365,Awesome Co-Op Shooter And Can Pick Up For Pennies
8366,"Madness made RPGxShooter ship. Tried it, loved it, bought it."
8367,"Great game  :)
Fun with friends..."
8368,"This game is an amazing FPSRPG! I highly recomend 10/10
"
8369,Fun
8370,"Well, all things in this game except the design and concept feel like drunk people get around and write down some ideas for a game with DLC's that eat your time like a fat kid at mcd's. 11/10. claptrap is my homeboy"
8371,"Suppose you take a space western like.. Firefly perhaps and change everything to the cel-shaded art style. Then change the story, add A LOT of different weapons, amazing music and make a game out of it. Amazing. Bravo gearbox!"
8372,awesome!!!
8373,"The story lacks, but it does set the scene for Borderlands 2, so it's ok, I guess.

Also, Bloodwing is best."
8374,❤️
8375,Great when playing alone or with friends. Good storyline and characters.
8376,"Classical game ; Thx to it, more people start enjoy ""incredible messy loads of guns"" kind of game ;
Play on unonfficial version for hundred and hundred (and hundred) hours ; finally bought it ; 
Don't buy it, the second one (and his DLC) is way better (don't care about the Pre-sequel, it's like the second one, but not as good)"
8377,"If you haven't played Borderlands, honestly, what are you doing with your life."
8378,Great
8379,+1
8380,"One of my al time favourite games.

Hours of fun, good replay value. Massive fun with friends



Just do it. your pants will thank you"
8381,"0 replayability. Takes forever to finish the game, I needed to take a couple month break and I came back! But... it lost its fun for me.


Edit: It is a good game, but rough around the edges. If you are new, play Borderlands 2 first"
8382,"If you love Multi-Player / Single-Player 1st person shooter then this game is freaking AWESOME.

Amazing graphics and story line - you will not be disappointed."
8383,"A fun, fast paced ""loot n' shoot"" FPS with some funny dialogue inbetween shooting enemies up."
8384,"about to finish the game,

amazing

trying to do 100% achievements, than its get anoying
nobody plays it online anymore"
8385,"Great game but fun actually really starts with DLC's , zombie island was so funny and ironic that I am hooked and need to play all Borderlands games and DLC's and i have them in library too :)"
8386,"One of my favourite CO-OP RPGs, many hours of looting, shooting, doing crazy quests for crazy people such as Dr Ned, also there is alot of content in the DLC's, my favourite of which is Dr Zed's Zombie Island as I like zombie games and it gave so much more to do in the game. Overall I rate 8.5/10."
8387,"ever felt like beating the crap out of someone who thinks as a badass? this game lets you do that
worth it"
8388,"The best FPS that I have played in years. Just shoot, loot, run, repeat. #PHASEWALK!"
8389,"Ok, let's make it quick, because I'm recommending this but with some reservations. The game is an awesome sci-fi ARPG loot-em-up with a graphic style you'll either love or hate, a great sense of humour and well designed combat action. The interface is a little clunky - par for the course for a console-to-PC port, awkward but not frustratingly so - and I've run across a couple of missions with mobs too far above the difficulty level to be realistic, but nothing game-breaking.

Unfortunately, there is a major technical design issue. The engine defaults to a 75-degree field of view, no matter your actual screen ratio. That's fine for 4:3 displays (the noughties called, they want their monitors back) but for 1080p displays, it makes maintaining situational awareness in combat a major headache - quite literally for some people. It's like your character has a zoom lens surgically attached to their face.

There is a work-around for the problem (Google ""Borderlands FOV Fix"") and it's not perfect - you can't change the default FOV and it's reset when you get in and out of vehicles or move between zones, so you have to bind the FOV set command to a key to quickly reset it every time that happens. It's a royal pain in the behind, but it brings the game back up to playable.

Without that fix, I simply wouldn't be able to recommend this game. Shame on Gearbox that it's even necessary after all this time, and they can only get away with it because this is so cheap."
8390,"one of the best games I've played, I was at college then and was the first time that I had a lot of time and my own PC to play PC games (but I didn't have a steam account at that time), 6 years passed and I can still recall many memories"
8391,"idk how many hours i've really played this game, since i had a copy for xbox too."
8392,Game was great i love the borderlands trilogy
8393,"Borderlands is an Opus in the world of RPG first person shooters. The entire franchise is worth playing over and over in my opinion. I really can't think of anything I don't like about Borderlands. If you like first person, sci fi, and or RPG you can't go wrong with this title."
8394,"Although this game now seems very simple compared to the two sequels that have followed it, it's still a great game. Pick it up on the cheap."
8395,"If you love loot, RPG and FPS, this game is the perfect blend of them."
8396,"""GUNS GUNS GUNS"" Marcus"
8397,I had seen this game in stores and on the internet for years and it never interested me. My friend bought it for me and as I gave it a go I fell in love with this game. Similar to Skyrim or other open world games but with cool cartoon graphics. Great game 10/10 would buy again. Or let a friend buy it for me again.
8398,"Great game, always will be one of my favorites and in the years to come should be hailed as a Classic."
8399,Fantastic game. Should buy. Worth it. Play it. So fun.
8400,"Take the good part of a FPS, add the best parts of an action rpg, spice it with the rpg elements of Diablo 2 and serve it with a starcraft / mad max setting. 

The game rocks, there is humour, there is randomly generated loot, classes, skill trees, bosses, multiplayer, a story, arena survival, dlc campaigns."
8401,"Para mi ya se ha vuelto un clasico, el cual jugaria en momentos de nostalgia gamer, con este juego muchos nos enviciamos con la saga, a algunos no les gusta o dan mala opinion del juego por sus ""graficas"" porque en realidad no entienden o no han jugado el juego o son fanboys de ""cod ó halo"". En fin Si tú, el que esta leyendo este review te da por jugar borderlands empieza por este juego y despues con el 2 para que lo disfrutes mas."
8402,"Like any RPG, there are quests galore to complete for items, cash and experience, and the more of these you complete, more areas of the game will unlock. All quests can be completed in single player, although two players on the same system works just as well, as does three or four people playing together via the internet. All quests offer a set number of experience points, but experience gained through monster kills depends upon the level of the character and the level of the monster he is slaying - more experience for tougher monsters, and little or no experience for very weak monsters when your character is far more powerful.
The art style is amazing, I know a few people who were put off by the cell shading look but once you're in game it all makes sense and the game wouldn't look right any other way, the characters are varied enough and some of the enemies are downright hilarious, shotgun toting midgets who fly back from the recoil when they fire at you are just one of the neat animations that this game is filled with.
The storyline is a bit faint, your dropped into the game with the overall target been to find 'the vault' but there are hundreds of missions to do as you go through each area, most areas finish with a boss and some of the boss fights are pretty interesting (Boss's tend to drop their weapons after you fight them which is nice).
"
8403,"I remember playing this game on the X-box with a friend at one point and then it kinda disappeared, I got it again on steam and I now remember the majestic glory that is Bibberlends. 
I only have a couple words to say and those are: SHOOT, QUEST, AND SHOOT SOME MORE!!!
Literally just summed this game up.
But it is a really good game in all seriousness, and a funny one too. But just remember kids, don't wait until you are of age to play this game, lie about your age and buy it because it is so fucking fun."
8404,"When I first saw borderlands I kind of judged it before I played and I didn't play it for a long time, I bought it because it was on sale and figured I'd give it a try. This is an unreal game that is not only o e of few games with originality but done very well. I definitely recommend it to any o e who likes games like mass effect and fps."
8405,Fabulous
8406,"It's a good implementation of a cool idea: it's basically an action/FPS-MMORPG where you don't have to worry about online idiots cramping your style. It's got procedural weapons, intense battles, and vehicle combat. If Roadwarrior was a video game, this would be it."
8407,"Borderlands was one of the first games I ever played, and coming back to it today, I still love the damn thing to bits.

I got this game a couple of years ago via a USB that was circulating around the classroom at school, and instantly fell in love with those trademark, cartoony-realistic graphics the game is famous for. Having beaten the game on that presumably illegally downloaded copy, I jumped at the chance to buy it on sale (Humble Bundle is OP :D), hence my low playtime."
8408,"Review only for the main game, haven't touched the DLC yet.

As far as FPS games go, this one has more enjoyable gameplay than most, up to a point. I ended up mostly sticking to the sniper rifles and shotguns when playing, while the mid-range weapons felt mostly interchangable and ultimately only useful as a backup.

The game is also kiiiind of repetitive, the same basic enemy types for 80% of the game, and then the new enemy types introduced are fairly overpowered at first. The Old Haven missions in particular are just... awful. Too many enemies everywhere you look, not helped by the fact that you've never seen them until that point.

The story is almost nonexistent and vague at best; there's the occasional funny moment but they're very rare. I felt quest variety was decent, there were a fair number of different types, though a lot of them overlapped and felt kind of samey. Graphically the style is nice, but everything, again, ends up looking really samey.

Music is... I dunno because the only way I could bring myself to play this was by turning off the music and putting on my own while I played. Voice acting is probably decent but I didn't hear half of it because it was drowned out by music (had subtitles on though so I didn't miss any dialogue or anything.)

But at the end of the day, it's fun enough. Not in long bursts, I was never able to take this for more than an hour and a half or so at a time, but. I can't say I hate it or even dislike it, but I have to imagine the second game is better in every way."
8409,"Great game
I like the story and post apocalyptic topic."
8410,That is fun to play with friends
8411,"Nearly 48 hours in, only done with the main game and 2 of the DLC's.

If you like run n' gun shooting, or old style no press x to get into cover shooting then this game is for you. Its fun and can be funny at points.

My only complaints is late game on your first playthorugh, there will be near zero good guns, but that's because you already have pretty much the best stuff for your first time through. Also, there only one fast travel points for DLC's which really makes the DLC's only good and not really good.

8.5/10 - Would shoot everything again."
8412,"good, but part 2 is better."
8413,"!!SPOILER ALERT!!

The ending sucks"
8414,"If you have watched Mad Max, then you should really play this game. This game takes a desert world, and let's you play through the entire game in a similarr environment, without getting boring. That is true game design right there. For example, Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel has most of it's environment on the moon, and that game to me is quite boring. As far as the Plot goes for this game, it's nothing too spectacular, however, the overall story is rememberable and enjoyable. Gameplay wise, I think it's a perfect merger of FPS and RPG, as your skill point alloccation really changes your gameplay with new and powerful techniques. Sniping is a bit shitty, however, the other guns are powerful, and the better guns have a rare drop rate that you can farm in certain circumstances; the DLC's have the most availabity,a nd the main game sucks for it. This game is multiplayer, however, when I've played it with a friend, it was laggy, and very precise with the missions (as in you need to be on the exact mission bit to turn in the mission, no skipping).
If there is anything to take away from this, it's that this game is amazing, however,  if you want a great Borderlands expereience, go for Borderlands 2, then comeback to this one, as it can be glitchy, it punches in the face with it's fuck-you interactions (it's very enduring, nbot a bad thing(it's hard to explain)), and I think it gets cleaned up a lot in the sequel. I do prefer this game over the sequel, and I love this franchise so much. 9/10."
8415,There's no real story to it although the second one brings the first nicely into the fold. It's fun and pretty easy to learn. It works well with a controller. Roland's turret sucks though.
8416,nice game
8417,Expected more..
8418,Quintessentail Shoot and loot game.
8419,"once you get past the awkward menu interface the game is amusing, fun, graphicly pleasing style, and overall a great game!"
8420,"Shot a guy a with a rocket launcher. He laughed. Switched to a pistol and shot him again. He exploded. 

10/10 Pistols > Rockets"
8421,"It is my first go at Borderlands series, I've made up my mind that I will start from B1, go through it and then move  on to B2 and presequel. It was a great choice, I've made a team of 3 people and we're playing in COOP mode. Game brings me joy and altough a bit old it still has a stunning graphics. I have heard that the B2 is much better, but to truly appreciate it you should play B1 first. 

That's what we're doing. Game costs pennies now, so if you're thinking dear Player, about buying it - don't wait and just do it. You won't regret this decission."
8422,Satisfaction abounds.
8423,"Time for the most unpopular opinion ever! I HATE this game. I've tried playing it multiple times and I just don't like it. I was gonna refund it, but then I played the second one. Holy crap. The second one is my favourite game. What's different? Well, the art is more refined, the models and lighting as begger, and the gameplay is superb and can stand on its own both in and out of multiplayer. I definitely get the ""First game in the seties"" vibe from this, and I recommend reading the wiki page and going straight to the sequel."
8424,"[h1]""If RPG and FPS made a baby it would be Borderlands""[/h1] 

The first part of the Borderlands series was a marvelous breakthrough. Some Diablo fan developers of Gearbox reinvented the way of co-op fighting and looting in a post apocalyptic world named ""Pandora"". Containing 4 different iconic characters which you can levelup by XP gained from kills or solving quests is still today (6 years after release) a highly addictive game concept. The other thing is the random weapon looting generator which produces practically an infinite variation of all kind of weapons (with elemental damage, multipliers, rarities, weapon classes, character class mods, grenade mods and shields). You can buy weapons from vendor machines but mostly they are hidden in weapon cases, lockers or stashes all over the landscape or they drop from killed enemies. So you cleanout an area in action loaded sequences (the AI is great) and after that you compare stats of dropped and looted weapons.

You better play together with your friends. The game is up to 4 players co-op which is a great experience. Even if there are sometimes loot conflicts or quest solving / achievements asynchronities. Whatever is the reason it still makes fun.
Very innovative was the unique cell-shade graphics at that time which gave the game the perfect comic look. Mixed-up with FoV and depth sharpness effects it felt quite modern and fresh. Today it feels a bit blurry but still nice to watch. Shooting at enemies let drop several damage numbers and criticals hits out of their bodies which is quite funny. 
The Bossfights are totally epic. Everything seems very story driven. Other things like quests of collecting things are rather repetive. If you finished the main story you will reach lvl36 but on a second playthrough you can farm enough XP to levelup to lvl50 and lateron with DLCs to lvl69 (max level).   The 4 DLCs content is quite extensive storytelling and new epic bossfights. You cannot miss all the DLCs in the GOTY version which is totally recommended and worth to buy."
8425,My Favorite Game
8426,Poop Train. 10/10
8427,boring and dumb like the rest of the series
8428,"little story, a lot of fun"
8429,"I was never on Xbox growing up so this is me discovering Borderlands for the first time. I can honestly say this game is probably the best purchase I have made on Steam, so far. Completion is a must. 10/10 must have."
8430,"Love this game!   Too much....  lol

I like everything about the game mostly, except the slow vehicle driving speed compared to the extreme driving fun in Borderlands II.  The other small issues can be either ignored, or fixed (read on):

I strongly suggest getting the [url=http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Borderlands#Borderlands_Config_Tool]Borderlands Advanced Settings[/url] program as it fixed the annoying thick outlines which ruin the immersion and sniping views for me.  Also, the terrible default FOV that feels like running around with binoculars taped to your head.  The default FOV also makes it quite difficult judging distance when jumping.  But, the [url=http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Borderlands#Borderlands_Config_Tool]Borderlands Advanced Settings[/url] can fix all that!"
8431,"Flimsy storyline, big guns, big laughs, great game"
8432,"Borderlands is a fun game about combat, levelling  and loot. It isn't particularly deep, but still will entertain, especially if you have friends to party with. It combines the RPG and FPS elements reasonably well, but don't expect it to be as good as Deus Ex. Play if you like collecting loot, the Diablo series and the Torchlight series. Don't play if you need a story, characters to empathise with or thought-provoking content."
8433,Bloodwing is the best character
8434,"10\10 because I made a brick named Shrek and punched a lot of things.

I fisted the Dickstroyer so hard the vagina looking thing exploded.

Onions have layers, Ogres have layers. Ogre's also yell a lot about blood. 



""BLOODWING!"""
8435,"It took me a long time to get into Borderlands. I was reading one of the reviews here on Steam, about somebody who was talking about how enjoyable it was to go back to Borderlands, and decided to fire it up.

I was not disappointed. 

I was somebody who played Borderlands 2 first, and found the experience very meh. Too many guns, too difficulty to min/max my character. It was overwhelming, and I shortly gave up (don't worry though, I went back to it later!)

So, when thinking about playing Borderlands, I expected the same, but with worse graphics. It took a few hours to get in to, but when I did, it clicked. 

Borderlands is wonderful. The characters are so diverse and deep and real, set in a world where treasure hunters are real and are inspiring. I thoroughly enjoyed Borderlands, even though it is a little dated. As an introduction to the Borderlands universe, I found this awesome, and found myself invigorated and excited to play the rest of the franchise.

It took me 27 hours to complete the game, and I would definitely recommend it! 

Nilesy"
8436,"First person Diablo but without any of the charm, too much dumb lolrandum humor, boring gameplay.  Game tries to goad you into playing with huge random assortment of guns, but most of them are completely worthless."
8437,"Yes
"
8438,Borderlands : My new favorite game franchise
8439,Prime fuckin' gucci.
8440,"Nice game, wouldn't buy any DLC's but its a nice game. But the map seems small as Hell, I mean like I walk 20 feet and there's already a laser barrier."
8441,Great fun with friends. An old classic.
8442,"5 June 2020 EDIT : Played on Linux using Steam Play Proton 4.11 and 5.0+

A really great game.

The storyline is nicely written, the atmosphere is completely crazy, the graphics quality is eye-friendly, the sound effects are well done.

Yup, a game that really makes sense when played in co-op !"
8443,"Pretty sure everyone has said all there is to say about Borderlands. I'll give you my 2 cents though... in a quick manner. 

My second playthrough about 2 years after I first played through it. Enjoyed the main campaign a lot more, the variation of loot is always good. The gameplay gets pretty stale later in the game, especially during the DLC.

I didn't really like the fact that I couldnt have the graphical settings on full and get less than 30 fps, my rig is more than capable of being able to handle this game 6 years after release. I've read in places though, that the game is not very well ported for pc. 

For me, it was all about the exploration, the experience and story. Kinda wish they would have just left it at the main campaign and forgot about some of the DLC because the Knoxx add on just draaaaaggged on, Moxies was kinda pointless, Neds was ok and so was Claptraps. Otherwise a very uniqe and memorable experience."
8444,Game has a good sense of humor. Pretty messed up. but that is what I enjoy.
8445,This game is awesome
8446,"Lots of stuff to do, kill and farm. Waste your life one crawmerax at a time :)"
8447,very good blasty blasty
8448,old but still the best
8449,10/10 like a sausage down a skag den
8450,"I've played way too many games in my day. But. I can honestly say out of all of them. This one is by far my favorite and best rpg, shooter, zombie mess, crazy dope dlc, funny, annyoing yet satisfying, out of all them. Git. It."
8451,Best FPS Ever!!!! :D
8452,"Very fun and addicting.
8/10."
8453,"I played this way back in 2009, on the PS3. I was introduced to the game as a 9 year old through my recently late grandfather, and I have loved the Borderlands series ever since. I have him to thank for sharing the world of Borderlands to me, and I'll never forget it.

While Borderlands 2 is most certainly the better game, through story, gameplay mechanics and replayability, this game will be my favourite out of the four main games for the memories it helped me make. Replaying countless times through corrupt saves on PS3, begging my parents to buy the new DLCs as they came, farming Crawmerax and the Knoxx Armoury for legendaries, and being excited for a possible second instalment; a lot of precious moments that I will always remember.

If you're interested in checking out Borderlands for the first time, I'd honestly recommend playing Borderlands 1 through the 10th Anniversary ""Enhanced"" version, which has modern QoL changes like FOV sliders, graphical quality settings and a functioning sensitivity slider. An overall much better experience for players who are looking to start the series fresh, rather than seek nostalgia."
8454,"Fun as hell, but I have had problems getting it to run on newer machines."
8455,"This is a cult game and one of the biggest hits of the previous generation. For its time, innovative with a cell-shaded world, in addition to a wonderful blend between FPS and RPG.

Essentially, the player controls a character with a skill tree. Each level gained grants a skill point, which can be assigned to a given skill. Additionally, each character has a special ability (e.g. Brick is a Berserker). Combine this with guns, and abundant humour, and it is a must-play game.

Strongly recommend getting the Game of the Year edition for the full Borderlands experience.

Play this, you will not regret your choice.

Played on Windows 10 Pro x64 without any problems."
8456,"It's okay, i guess."
8457,"Wow. This game is incredible. The gameplay is fantastic, so much to do. Can be a little difficult at times, but that's what the multiplayer is for. Very amazing RPG/Open-World/FPS game. Plus, Claptrap is the best robot ever."
8458,"THE OG, love this series. the original does have its flaws but had more random types of weapons. overall worth playing."
8459,"When this game came out there was much internet hoohaw about cellshaded style gaming , personally I was one of them , but the cartoon style just grew on me.

It wasnt a mould break , or maker , but it was and still is a quite playable game , one of the few that started out with the now somehwat normal practive of modern devs and the DLC.

Now I bought the game GOTY , game of the year , with all the DLC , probably on sale and hadnt played a game in the style before , so it was a learning curve , however it was worth messing about as it educated me on what at the time was a new idea - the FPSRPG or RPGFPS if you will.

Comedic scrpting worked , although there was many updates for the technical aspects which plagued it at the beginning.

Depending on price , and whether its your sort of game ,its well worth a punt when on sale , or part of an anthology with its second outing.

"
8460,"My personal favorite Borderlands game. It has a charm that none of the others had, or at least they tried to overdo it to the point where it was obnoxious."
8461,"Steam version has memory leaks, So your framerate gets lower and lower untill you either freeze or untill you restart the game. Otherwise great game"
8462,"I'd like to preface this review by reccomending the Borderlands Advanced Configuration Tool, this allows you to tweak the settings to make the game look even better than it does, as well as allowing for FOV tweaks, command console, etc.

This is the game that started it all, something about all the loot you can pick up just tantalized an entire group of gamers who felt like Pandora was a second home. This game isn't as story rich as Borderlands 2, and is a little rough around the edges in some spots, but it is still such a great game that everyone needs to play.

The little bit of story there is is that Pandora is home to the Atlas corporation, who make the crap planet even crappier, and there are legends of ""Vaults"" around the planet, and this draws in Vault Hunters looking for them. You essentially compete with the corporations to open the Vault, you get all the pieces of the key and open it, that's as spoiler free as I can make it. 

This game's claim to fame was the absolutely obscene amount of guns it has, I've heard this game talked about as more of a experiment to put this many guns into a functioning game, and as such is why the story is as lightweight as it is, and Borderlands 2 was a more proper game utilizing the technology. You have a choice of 4 heros, a Berserker, a Siren, a Soldier, and the Hunter, each of these classes have their own traits that make them unique, but no class is restrained to a certain weapon type.

When I said the game can be rough around the edges, I mean that in that there are some bits of the game that are poorly executed and pretty frustrating, they are mainly little things, like the lack of checkpoints in some areas, forcing you to run back through the empty area to get back to the boss, and the game forcing you to kill bunches of enemies before you can pass through an obstacle you could have passed through easily. One last annoying bit is how Claptrap seems to infinitely remind you that there are new jobs available on x Bounty Board.

One of this games strongsuits is the humor, most every character has some sort of thing about them that makes them unique and funny. My personal favorite is Scooter the car guy.

All in all, out of the 3 main series Borderlands games, this is the second best. Better than the dumpster fire that is the Pre Sequel, but not as good as the masterpiece that is Borderlands 2, overall I give it a 9/10, do yourself a favor and play it now."
8463,An excellent game. I certainly play it also in 20 years...
8464,"trip to Pandora... what wish more :)
"
8465,Take your friends guns and make them mad! Maybe you even know a couple bitches who will quit the game if you take their class mods KEKEKEKEKKEKEKEK!
8466,"Definitely recommend, played this on the 360 and im going for full acheive here on steam.  Many hours clocked in and so much replayability."
8467,"Awesome game good story cool easter eggs and fun to farm in.

10/10"
8468,"A lot of things in this game that I liked very much, and find myself upset/angry at Gearbox for not including in the second game, which would have made the game actually even more fun than it was already. If you own BL2, I say try this one out to see what 2 is lacking, and the chance to play in the shoes of the original Vault Hunters themselves. At least, before the Pre-Sequel where... I digress, spoilers. ;) It's similar to 2 with it's own twist on the formula, even if there is hardly any dialogue, the gunplay is solid, and enemy dismemberment (including DECAPITATION VIA HEADSHOTS!! why the heck was that not in BL2, Gearbox?!) is satisfyingly gruesome, and enemies look a bit... cooler. (I guess(?)) Either way, I say it's worth trying, for the sake of it, and some of you out there that heard about the bosses and stuff in this game and want to know what it's like first-hand taking them on here!"
8469,10/10 would bang again
8470,"There is a common glitch going on with the ""Borderlands: Game of the Year"": There is a problem with the sound. No sound at all once game play begins for multiple people."
8471,pretty good
8472,"This is the game I played with my friends through a dark period in my life, so if I seem overly gushing it's probably because it's true.

This is a good game. When it came out, the story wasn't all that predictable. There really wasn't another ""FPS RPG"". This game has AMAZING atmosphere. It's barren, desolate, and you can go hours without talking to a person (bounty boards don't count). The pacing is really well done, the controls are everything you'd expect out of an FPS (though the vehicle controls are much worse than other BL games). 

Yes, I realize this game was kind of buggy, but it wasn't buggy in a ""We made this game in less than a year because we're milking the crap out of this series, enjoy an unplayble game until a day 1 and 2 patch come through"" way like AC 3 or unity are. It's got a few little glitches (and a few you can actually exploit, like easy kills on skagzilla) that are memorable, kind of in the same way that the safari/veridian/cinnibar cheat is.

This game is better than the pre-sequel or the sequel. It has way better ""deserted planet"" atmosphere. The humor is there, but it feels drier, and more connected with the morbidity of the situation. The 2nd game just inserts assloads of ""wacky"" humor just because. Main antagonist taunting you over wireless communication? Cool. Main antagonist acting like a 4 year old and making fart jokes and dick jokes every chance he gets? Eh... harder to take him seriously at the end, when you want me to feel like he's a badass by telling the end boss to kill me. Also sweet googly moogly 4 DLC packages is fine, if not a little overbearing (but at least each one had an interesting side story to tell), but four extra stories, two extra classes, two ""get moar levels"" DLC, and fartloads of costumes? Ah well, dial it back.

So, I guess my personal ideal borderlands game would be atmosphere and story like the first game, vehicle controls and classes like the 2nd game, and the space battles, laser, and ice weapons of the ""3rd"" game. It's too bad 2k Australia closed. At least the 1st game is still fun."
8473,"VERY good game! I like it becouse story kills, and game is awsome!"
8474,Beautiful game. The graphics work well on my old pc but at the same time are amazing to look at.  Being a sniper and getting a headshot is so satisfying. Game is simplistic but fun and challenging at the same time :)
8475,Good game so far
8476,"I've not %100 been into rpg games like The Elder Scrolls, mainly because I feel the world was just to bland for me and it was too much like a fairy tale, also there weren't FUCKING GUNS. I mainly bought this game 'cuz I asked my boyfriend what was a good Borderlands game to play, and he reccomended the 1st one. I've heard a lot about people not liking the 1st one, but come on guys, we all start somewhere don't we? I really REALLY enjoyed this game, and it took awhile to complete it too! It's worth your time to pick up, definitely. But then again, you also should play the pre-sequal and 2."
8477,Best game NA
8478,"I personally prefer Borderlands 2 over this as it's way easier to get into and more story driven, but Borderlands 1 is what started a great game series."
8479,"If this is not in your library of games, you doing games wrong."
8480,"Borderlands is one of the funniest & addicitive game I have played in a long time.
It has very high retail & replay value.

The story line pretty good.
Great weapon selections & player MODS for the different characters.

This is an excellant game to play...I would put it in the top 20 games to come out in the last couple of years.

Dont pass it up when steam puts in on sale!!"
8481,"Fun to play, even more fun in Coop with friends via LAN or online!"
8482,Had tons of fun with this game with my family and husband. Lots of fun FPS open world fun.
8483,"So I just finished this game today after deciding to pick up the goty edition to replay.  At seventeen hours I have completed the main story and have not yet played any of the dlc so I'll just be reviewing the core game itself.

Graphics/Sound 7/10
Now I'm not a big graphics guy, they're not a huge selling point for me, and I knew coming in that this is an older game.  With that in mind, I really didn't mind.  Yes, they're dated.  No, this isn't going to look like Skyrim.  But the style is unique and this isn't a HD remake so I didn't really see much to complain about.
As far as sound, the game has an almost western style soundtrack in most of the maps that helped drive home the desolation of the planet and the opressive heat most of the game seems to take place in.  Nothing to write home about but it was good enough.

Gameplay 7/10
I've seen some reviews calling the game a walking simulator and, to be honest, i can't really disagree.  I found myself running around on foot doing nothing to get from one place to another a whole hell of a lot, to the point that I chose to ignore a mission until the next time I played because I didn't feel like going to a map I was just at to walk from one end to the other again. 
Besides that, the combat is fun and can get hecktic at times and the banter from the enemies is enjoyable.  A downside is that some fights just feel unfair and the final boss fight is anti-climatic and easily cheated.  Also, for a game that boasts a rediculous number of different weapons, most of them felt the same.  It was hard to tell one shotgun from the next and the only really noticable variation was with the combat rifles (large magazine fully automatic or smaller capacity semiautomatic rifle style) and the handguns (semiautomatic pistol style or revlover).
Even with those problems the combat is still tight and enjoyable and it's nice to see an enemy who was electrocued to death have his face melt off down to his skull.

Story 4/10
This is where Gearbox really dropped the ball with Borderlands.  There is a story, I promise you, but you have to go out of your way to read the mission logs (some of which, like the claptrap or scavenger ones, are copy and pasted) and pay attention to the NPCs when they call which can be difficult if you're in combat.  The story is also pretty bare bones, leaving a lot of questions unanswered (I think the guardians are only mentioned once or twice in passing) and like I mentioned before, the ending is pretty anti-climatic and just sort of drops off suddenly.

Overview 7/10
All in all, this game has it's problems.  It's a little outdated and if you don't like refrences to other media then maybe this isn't for you.  Gearbox didn't really hit their stride with the series until the second game but this one was a good start.  It's funny, unique, and enjoyable as long as you keep in mind that it's six years old."
8484,"Normally i don't like shooters, but for Borderlands i made exception.
If you are looking for a COD or Battlefield experience the game is not for you.
The game feels more like a arcade shooter with humour.

I like the design of the weapons with their elemental effects and other special effects the only thing which i don't like is RNG on the weapon.
The design of the levels are nice, but sometimes it feels very much of the same.

Overall it is a 8/10"
8485,"What can I say, other than that Borderlands changed my life? I had given up on gaming; didn't even have a PC. Then, I was introduced to the borderlands. Hilarious writing, fun adventures, endless loot-- who could as for more?"
8486,Best game ever.10/10
8487,"this game was worth making a sequel, and it was great too. buy both."
8488,To damn good.
8489,"Once I got over the Cell Shaded Graphics, this game was amazing. Bought all 4 of the series."
8490,"This game is very enjoyable. This game really has a lot of the elements that make this feel like a Borderlands game. Borderlands isn't better than Borderlands 2 or The Pre-Sequel, but if you enjoy the Borderlands universe, this game gives a lot of history and lore of Pandora. The only downside I have with this game is that the story is pretty short, I don't like the Vault Hunters that much, and the lack of an FOV slider is hard to get used to. 8/10"
8491,Its Borderlands what more can you say! If you don't know anything about the game grab a copy when on sale. As a FPS it’s mildly amusing and even better co-op.
8492,Pretty good!
8493,"Very addicting. Provides plenty of hours gameplay, has an extraordinary humor and some funny easter eggs. but in the end, after all quests (incl. DLCs) have been finished, there was nothing left to do but searching the legendary ""Pearlescent"" weapons. Still good game."
8494,"Great idea for a game, but it's really boring, and the ending is unsatisfactory."
8495,Holy crap it shoots rockets!
8496,"Its good, could use a saturation slider though."
8497,"Even though number 2 is better in just about every way, Borderlands is still worth starting with or going back to if you can deal with a few rough edges. Lots of guns, lots of baddies and lots of fun can be had here, and there are hours and hours and hours of content if you throw all the DLC in as well. Look for a sale price, pick it up, polish it off, and jump straight into Borderlands 2 if you haven't already for an excellent upgrade to your shooty looty experience :)"
8498,"This game features tons of fun and great hummor.

Would totaly reccomending playing it with a friend!"
8499,"Borderlands is the perfect game for those who love ignorant and mocker shooting. The amount of all different weapons as well as the vastness of the game zones is very impressive. In short, this is a game that all fans of the FPS should have in their library. What are you waiting? Lets start your search for the crypt!"
8500,Just do it!
8501,"Extremely boring game. Like a walking simulator but with shoots. NPC are just here for quest gathering and have zero life by itself. The worst part comes when you play in single player because lacks of a captivating story (btw has cliffhanger end), plenty of bugs (collisions and quest tree history mainly) that are weird to found on a GOTY game... Maps lacks on life (vegetal and animal) and split the idea of a desert life for Pandora's world.

Anyway, has some funny dialogues, a properly translated and voiced game.

DLC are €a$h grabs. There are none plot connection with main story to clarify eridian question and the Vault meaning, just random quest for XP/Gold and fighting against some Pandora's corporations like Atlas or Jakobs. They are not worthy to play but for playing more hours without an interest on story for keeping entertained with some pal... well, maybe.

DLC Moxxi is the most useless of them, just waves for waves of enemies.

I can't recommend this game.

My own Spanish review here: http://www.lanif.com/blog/?p=1311"
8502,"Great action-FPS RPG.

+ Cool missions
+ Cool gear
+ Class variety
+ End game content is pretty awesome

- Lots of traveling back and forth
- Arena challenge quests
- Would like some randomized maps
"
8503,This game is fantastic. It's worth playing for the writing alone.
8504,"Great game to play, and one you can easily get lost in
"
8505,"Quick Summary – A First Person Shooter in an open world with a random loot drop system so you can grind for awesome weapons. Multiplayer co-op is built into the game so you can play with your friends, but you may want to go through it the first time by yourself so you can take your time and absorb the story. Overall a great game that will take you a long time to complete, especially if you play the game in “hard mode” after beating the story.

You take on the role of one of 4 “vault hunters” recently arrived on the planet Pandora, searching for a mythical alien Vault, supposedly filled with treasure and advanced technology. While each of the playable characters has their own backstory, the real flavor of the game comes from the colorful characters that you meet during your journey. Not only are you up against the huge bandit population, but Pandora is stocked up on alien wildlife, and the powerful Crimson Lance army is here to claim the Vault for themselves.

The game is played in the first person perspective, and most of the combat is with the various guns and grenades that you find all over the place. Borderlands was advertised as having millions of different guns, and this is technically true. There’s a behind-the-scenes weapon “component” system that randomly determines the attributes of every gun you can find (even the unique quest rewards and legendary weapons). 2 guns can have almost the exact same specs but one has slightly higher damage, meaning these are 2 different guns. For gameplay purposes though, just find the most powerful weapons you can get with a nice variety of “elemental damage” (fire, lightning, corrosive) so that you can do bonus damage to any different types.

It’s not all about shooting though, the game also has an RPG-like skill system. When you level up you get a skill point to put into one of your passive skills, most of which are built around your character’s unique special ability. Depending on how you allocate your skills, your gameplay style will change drastically. Note that buying a skill respec is easy and inexpensive in this game, so feel free to try out various styles. Roland the soldier is good for beginners and Brick the berserker is good for experienced players in my opinion. 

Pros:
+”Drop in” co-op multiplayer where you can just join a friend’s game and play along with them. The biggest difference between multiplayer and singleplayer is that if you’re with a friend, they can rescue you if you go down. If you’re by yourself and get taken down, you need to get a “second wind” by killing an enemy in about 5 seconds or you die.
+There’s a huge number of side quests, and if you do them all you may find yourself a bit overlevelled. It’s worth it though, to experience the story and background of Pandora. Something I wasn’t initially aware of, is that you do reduced damage to enemies that are higher level than you. If you’re having trouble in an area, go do some side quests and when you level up, the enemies will be easier even though you’re using the same weapons.
+As mentioned before, there are a lot of characters to talk to and work with during the game. Even the enemies can be funny (right before you kill them). 

Cons:
-I really only noticed this after playing Borderlands 2, but in this first game it’s easy to miss the “flavor text” when starting a quest. It’s not read to you aloud, you actually have to scroll/read through it even though it’s presented as someone “talking to you.” Just a minor hindrance and it’s only a problem when you’re accepting a bunch of quests at the same time (you might miss out on why you’re doing a particular quest).
-Playing the DLC missions can be a real grind fest. Especially the brain collecting missions in the Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, and the arena matches in the Underdome. The DLC are definitely fun and worth playing through, but some of the collection quests take forever (just skip them if you want).

If you’re going to try playing the game to its completion with all the DLCs, expect to spend at least 30-40 hours. There are a bunch of Steam achievements and many of them are easily obtainable if you don’t mind spending the time (there are no “beat the game on super hard difficulty” type achievements. The ones that may give you trouble are the DLC tournament missions which you may give up on out of boredom, and the collectible achievements in the DLC New Robot Revolution."
8506,"The start of one of the best game brands in my opinion.

I did not get this game right off the shelfs when it first came out. I actually had to wait until my friend went to a store and saw this games ""game of the year edition"" and thought ""hey why not"", then he found out it was heavily focused on co-op and told me to buy it, I thought why not andgave it a chance, this is one of the best decisions in my life.

Would strongly recommend, however best to buy with friend."
8507,TRULY AWESOME!!!! Enough Said!!!!! 25 out of 10!!!!
8508,"Strip the salt, flesh the wound"
8509,"Very good FPS, not much of a story but that is compensated by the awesome gameplay. Leveling is a bit steep, forcing you to complete all of the side missions (which gets a somewhat boring due to the lack of story) to have a fighting chance during the main story missions. But overall I had a really good time playing."
8510,.
8511,Nice story. BL2 is better. Worth playing if you want a broader scope of how the Borderlands universe works.
8512,"Epic game, tons to do and not enough time in one day. Buy this game! Own this game! Love this game!"
8513,Great game still playing it in 2015!!
8514,good game
8515,Has better invisible walls then loot.
8516,Clicking boxes to open them is not fun.
8517,"I was desperately seeking a decent RPG-Shooter after Fallout and the cel-shaded visuals of this game piqued my interest. Suddenly i found myself amazed by the background story as well as stunning views of Pandora while hunting down the local fauna and shooting my way through hilariously designed antagonists. The diverse selection of weapons and the well-balanced difficulty of the game encouraged me to replay it over and over again yet i was not bored even a little bit. Yes, some areas are vast and require multiple checkpoints but Pandora is not a friendly place at all and that means you'll have to pay attention to survival as well as shooting every moving thing in your FOV!

On top of all, playing the storyline in co-op mode thrilled me even further because there is no strict party meta such as the traditional tank-healer-dps kind of thing - with the right class mods literally every party member can save the day which highlights that it's not only a mindless shooter. You may have to plan ahead, depending on your skill and mod choices. I found some heroes (Roland and Lilith) a bit stronger than others but all skill trees are very well-balanced and loved to play with each of them. In general, i am not very fond of choosing a difficulty level in games and i was glad to see Borderlands brilliantly balances it as you progess - by making you bump into mobs with higher levels you still can fight and fail hilariously! A beloved sandbox experience :)

In conclusion, if you still haven't played this masterpiece, i envy you. And yes, get it asap.

11/10.

PS: Ooops! I forgot to mention CL-4TP - your trash bin shaped funny little friend Clap-trap! Watch him doing awesome things in the main menu, you won't be disappointed :)"
8518,"I love this game, so this WILL BE BIASED :D

[b]LONG REVIEW (TL;DR REVIEW BELOW)[/b]
Borderlands is (and probably will forever be) my favorite FPS game.  I've got too many hours logged on the XB360 (I've beat it three or four times, and I've beat all of the DLCs at least once.  Even after all that time, when this game went on sale on the Humble site I had to buy it, and I'm now just as hooked as I was when I first got it for XB360 so many years ago.

The humor is in a class of its own (I love humorous games, such as this and Saint's Row IV), and the timing and delivery is impeccable.  The characters are all fleshed out in their own ways, and everyone is believable.  From Marcus the gun dealer with a Mr. Krabs-esque obsession with money, to Scooter the redneck mechanic, to Moxxi the sexy femme fatale looking for her fourth husband.  The game also has an extreme amount of gun variety (although not ""8.7 bazillion"" as the trailer claims) but even the Wikipedia page says the system can generate up to 3.5 million guns.  That's 3,500,000 different guns that may appear in the game!  You'll almost definitely never get the exact game sun twice.

The level design is varied and comprehensive, ranging from the vast open lands of the Dahl Headland to the cramped urban hellhole that is Old Haven, and the DLCs only add even more variety to the map design.  This, combined with the different skill trees of the four classes, means that this game has great replayability for those who aren't afraid to try a new class.  But even if you stick with the same class (Roland all the way), you can still get fun out of multiple playthroughs just from the fun and varied storyline.

If you're looking for a game with multiple layers of depth such as The Last of Us, that's not what this game is.  Borderlands is an intense, comical, and not-to-be-taken-overly-seriously shooter that combines intuitive gameplay with interesting characters and a special kind of humor.  Although I've played BL2 and BL:TPS, I will always come back to the game that started it all.

[b]TL;DR REVIEW[/b]
This is my favorite FPS game, and one of my favorite games of all time from of any genre."
8519,Fun in COOP.
8520,"I LOVE this game!!! I have not finished it, but it is a very interesting and involving game."
8521,nice game :)
8522,"Timeless classic. ""You're gonna be my new meat bicycle!"""
8523,"Love it, hard to go back to after Borderlands 2 but still a great game."
8524,"This game is very addictive. I've spent more time playing this on xbox360 and PC then more then any other game. The story is funny. Characters are great, well planned, over all 10/10 in my book. Almost a uncountable amount of guns, shields, relics, ect. You are able to playing this game so many times over, because playing with a new character will change they way you play. The game is full of hidden chests and Eggs, that will surely make you go nuts finding.


PROS:
-Fun
-Story Full
-Guns, Guns, and more Guns
-Bosses
-easy modding
-side quests, lots of them
-Fun enemies

CONS:
-Quite a long time to completely for newbies
-LTP is a little weird

8526,"I played this game a long time ago.  I was I think 10 when I got this on sale at my local Half-Price Books.  The game was fun, I loved playing the multiplayer and the people were so nice.  Then I got an OP weapon and shield where I could kill things in one hit as well as survive everything.  I finished the game at level 7...  Other than that, the game was fun and hilarious.  I didn't buy the DLC, so I was missing out on a lot.  Now that I have it on Steam, Im pretty happy I can play through the entire game as well as the DLC.  I would recommend BL 1 for the people who want more of the story behind the original Vault Hunters since this shows what they were like before they become leaders of the crimson raiders.  BL 1 doesn't exactly have the greatest maps like in BL 2, but its really fun especially co-op.  I would rate BL 1 am 8/10."
8527,"Against the arena's final boss: 

His health was so high and his defense was so tough that my strongest attack against his weakest points dealt only about 40 damage. His health bar never visually decreased. He refused to die. He couldn't hit me for his life. I kept dodging. I refused to die. This exchange lasted a about half an hour. At one point the wave restarted and respawned old enemies on me. Several times. Even if I went down, I killed a weaker enemy and revived. But I refused to die. I finally noticed a change in the boss's health bar, but then I realized... he has health regen. More hours past. I continued the same repetitave motion, running and jumping in a circle, turn, shoot, reload, run again. Again. And again. And again. I wouldn't give up. I couldn't. It became a battle of honor. I couldn't let my family down. Not against a giant fire-breathing dog.

10/10 would waste my entire sunday and not get my homework done again"
8528,Very fun game. I played the whole thing solo and still enjoyed it.
8529,"is a awesome adventure of 4 guys that are badass 
"
8530,"This is probably one of my favorite games ever, one maybe 3 of my top 5. It's amazing. While Borderlands 2 was much, much better,you couldn't have that game without this one. The humor, the characters, the weapons, the story, it all mixes together and makes an amazing game. If you don't have this game yet, pick it now."
8531,Is good 7/10
8532,Iz Gud
8533,Me and my friends were gonna 100% percent it. after about 8 hours we said fuck that. 10/10
8534,"Amazing game, have beatin it many times. would be more fun with people to play with in co-op though. if you need someone to play with (currently at the beginning) add me or message me"
8535,"Seriously a great game! So much fun in both single and co-op play with every character and their individual different play styles making the game feel different each time you start over!

9/10

8536,"UM DOS MELHORES JOGOS Q EU JA JOGUEI, GOSTARIA MUITO Q UM AMIGO BENEFICENTE ME DESSE O 2 OU O PRE-SEQUEL PF
"
8537,"Kill things get loot. if you like diablo you will like borderlands its that simple, its diablo with guns. Playing with friends is more enjoyable than playing solo because there is no story to keep you invested and the gameplay is very repetitive and doesnt vary so playing coop helps with those problems. I finished 1 dlc after beating the game and was too bored to continue with the other dlc's since i felt like after beating the game there was no point to keep playing. The pc port is also pretty awful too. Im ready to move on to borderlands 2.
6/10 (Decent)"
8538,"This is an absolutely massive game that manages to be fun the whole way through. If you don't like fps's, this game might change your mind with its pretty decent rpg elements. And the loot system is fun too if you're into that kind of thing.
Buying guns is for chumps most of the time though."
8539,GOOD GAME YOU SHOULD GET IT I HAVE IT ON THE XBOX 360 ALSO BUT PC IS BETTER QUAILTY
8540,"BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!
"
8541,love this game so much had to buy it again on my new computer
8542,Buy if you get a time machine and go back in time 5 years ago so the multiplayer isnt dead.
8543,"Fantastic shoot & loot, finished it a total of 19 times across all platforms, bring buddies have fun!"
8544,"Awesome game. When first playing it it takes a little getting used to, but after that it is fun. It is a bit annoying that the enemies keep repeating the same lines when attacking or taunting you, but over all it is very good."
8545,"This is my second time playing this cult-classic (I mean, I think it's a cult-classic, isn't it?) game, and honestly my steam ran out on this game pretty fast.... no pun intended. I don't mind Borderlands. I honestly don't. But I think it's praised too highly for things it honestly doesn't have. It reminds me heavily of MMORPG's, where you're released into a large, sparse worlds where you grind... and grind... and grind... till you get so OP that Sephiroth in his final form would hesitate before challenging you, and then the game's over. And, to be fair, this game isn't targeted towards me. I know it isn't. I can never get behind a large MMORPG, because they're always too big. I only got through the first Chapters of LOTR, WoW, and TOR before I looked up how much left I had to do, and my reaction was, ""Wait... SERIOUSLY!? I have THAT much still left to do!?"", and honestly one time with Borderlands is enough for me.

Graphically speaking, the game looks great. Textures have a nice cartoony look and add a nice appeal. However... the world itself isn't made that interesting, if that makes any sense. Yes, Pandora is large and filled with bloodthirsty killers, and there's the occasional person here and there to give you missions but... really? That's it? There's no factions you can join? No special tribal traditions you could walk in on? No natural phenomenons to observe? See, this game lacks what games like Grand Theft Auto, Skyrim, and Infamous do with their open worlds incredibly well is making it feel alive and dynamic. The world of Pandora just... isn't that fascinating to me. It feels more like moving from one theme-assigned hub world with x number of Level 1 enemies to another theme-assigned hub world with y number of Level 5 enemies.

Another problem I have is the story. It's just so flat! By the time you get to the big... squid thing... you stop caring! At least, I remember this happening my first time. Because there's no build-up. No pure force of adversity trying to stop you from getting it. No organization to help you and make you feel attached to. All the dialogue is mainly shown through text boxes. The cutscenes where you're introduced to the characters and the bits of dialogue they'll randomly spout out are interesting and humorous every now and then... but again, I'm not the kind of gamer. I don't want to see plot-specific contextual dialogue in a massive, dull paragraph. It just doesn't grab me. I like my reading in games to be more of a supplement, like in Fallout 3 or in Amnesia, where it's optional, but if you do read it- it adds a lot more to the story around you.

I also HATE grinding. With a passion. I'm surprised people actually like this mechanic, because to me it's just really repetitive. If you want to level up, you just keep shooting enemies... and when you've killed them all and you haven't leveled up yet... you find another area with enemies and keep shooting. Yes, quests can give you more XP, but they involve just as much shooting- but in the end, you hit ""E""! Ah! I see! THIS is was gameplay variety is!

I know I've torn some big holes in Borderlands, but to be honest, I don't hate this game. It never offended me. It never did anything exceptionally wrong to irritate me, but it's just not my kind of game. If all the things I described to you just gave you a boner... go for it. I just don't like it as much as other RPGs, or FPSs, or Open-World Sandboxes. It's a matter of taste, and I just don't like this game."

8548,"Great game fun to play if you have friends to play with you :)
8.5/10"
8549,"This game stands the test of time.  Humorous dialogue, fun weapons, and great art make this game.  If you are afraid it is too late to get into the series, do not worry about Borderlands feeling like an old game.  It is a well made game that will still be enjoyable for years to come.  If you like shooters, but prefer a single player or cooperative setting, you will like Borderlands.  If you like the experience of random drops and doing quests, Borderlands has these features in abundance.  Plenty of hours of fun and well worth the price tag nowadays."
8550,awesome game

Alot of funny moments.

8553,"Unrealistically amazing game from start to finish. Epic originality as far as RP and gameplay style. It gets super fast paced once you are maxed out. (Who can reload a minigun in .7 secs?)

You need friends, and they have to have good aim, or lots of bullets. ;)"
8554,"    Well the game worked perfectly well for me (Windows 8.1).

    This is a great game.  Perhaps not the greatest but a great game.

    Having completed it what makes it so good ?

    Firstly the rotoscope style graphics give it a definite and idiosyncratic visual style.

    The game has a vivid personality.  The robots are the most human creatures you'll encounter the entire game and the game has the fevered atmosphere of the dreams you would have suffering a heavy bout of flu after a Sergei Leone/ Mad Max/ King Kong all nighter.  On one level the lack of a safe, normal home base becomes wearing but on another a planet (explanation provided) virtually empty save for bandits, psychopaths, mercernaries, treasure hunters, and the lethal local fauna captures the flavour of the Leonie Westerns and the Mad Max films. 

    I played through as the soldier and on the base game there's a near perfect difficulty curve.  When I say near - there's a couple of missions when the game lies and tells you that missions are easier than they are.  There's also one occasion where a map was so difficult that I ended up half a dozen times or more fighting my way half way in and then fighting my way back out again.

    Some idiosyncracies of the game.  

    1) Enemies respawn.  So when fighting your way into enemy territory you need to ensure you have adequate ammo, shields, and health to fight your way out again.  Ammo drops are relatively generous, less so at those times of the game when it takes a lot of bullets to drop your enemies.  Until the final levels once you've figured out how to get ammo reloads on each map you rarely run out of ammo even on your favourite guns.

    2)  As well as the standard improvements in weapons, shields, and special abilities the game is handicapped so enemies who are lower levels than you do less damage to you and take more damage from your weapons - for higher level enemies the reverse is true.  So, unless you're incompetent, eventually you should be able to beat any foe simply by grinding X.P. Equally the game actively discourages players from skipping missions.

    3)  When you die you respawn losing a hefty chunk of your money but with the ammo you had at the point of death.  So if you were killed after a long firefight you need to hope to respawn next to an ammo point.  This is true most of the time and from about level 20 onwards the game allows you to ""jump"" between spawn points.

    4)  The game is NOT open world but the maps are big enough and well designed enough that you rarely feel hemmed in.

     Ending ?  Big lead up for not the greatest punchline.   

    It took me just under 70 hours to finish the game.  This is a solid FPS - great background, good storyline, huge array of weaponry with which to experiment.

    £9.99 ?  Maybe not.  But if you like FPS I'd flag this as a must buy the next time it comes on sale.

S.x.

8565,"The game that started it all. If you like science fiction. If you like New World Order ""conspiracy theories"". If you like sarcasm, the sardonic and sometimes a little black humour, then this might be your cup of tea. It's a bit like M.A.S.H. and some of the ideas of the comedian Bill Hicks as well as other assorted ideas, done in such a way that it can suck you in so you really do feel like you are on some far flung planet in a forgotten corner of the universe (sound familiar?). Then of course there are the role playing elements. Much scaled down from full role playing dynamics, of course, to suit the FPS focus. But Gearbox really broke out the ""FPS"" from the hole it had dug itself into, to spawn monsters like Far Cry 4 and other games. So, this game was really just a pleasant surprise for me. I had already had an eye on it well before its release. At first I was like ""why?"" to the new art direction, but that has become part of what gives Borderlands it personality, and humanity. Probably for me, the most surprising and satisfying part of the game has been it nods to all sorts of everyday ""real world"" concerns that sometimes seem like they are ""just your problem"" (NWO stuff, hint hint) and  that have always needed shooting down with a bit of sarcasm.

8574,"The goal of this segment is not to review the game it is [u] to organize information that can optimize your Borderlands 1 settings to make the game run correctly.[/u]

I like this game a lot. I played it on the Playstation Triple and it ran much better than on Steam. It has been a few years since I had played the first Borderlands game and initially on Steam it ran so poorly that I didn't want to play one of my favorite games on last-gen consoles.

Until I used these tweaks in the .ini files to make the game run perfectly. By that I mean without the horrible screen tearing and without what I would like to call ""the buttery mousepad effect"". There are also some other quality of life changes that are available to fine-tune your Borderlands to your own personal preferences.

1. [u]The screen tearing issue[/u] is caused by a setting in the .ini files that makes the game cap itself at 62 fps instead of 60. This is the most important change that you should make to your Borderlands 1 files. You will want to go to this link and follow the directions to correct this issue.
http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1092456

2. Several fixes can be found at this next link but the most notable ones are removing the unskippable intro movies (NVIDIA, 2k, etc), removing mouse smoothing (the buttery mousepad effect), enabling vsync, and changing ""hold-to-aim"" to a ""toggle-to-aim"". Many of the changes here are personal preference.

8575,"Such a great game.  I loved the art-style, the humor, the lore, everything.  

A couple parts can be tough but that means you either need to level a little more and come back, or try different elemental weapons.

Very fun to grind and level your character up. The guns and weapons are ridiculous and very vast. 

The graphics are very simple and well optimized. Most PCs would be able to play it at some level. With a simple confg file change you can unlock the 62fps cap so all the new 120 and 144hz screens will get put to use.

However, I was pretty disappointed. The first in the Borderlands series may have been released in 2009, but it had such a low budget that it looks and feels like it was made in 2003. I say this because it lacks many thing one would expect from an RPG, such as a minimap, diversity in the skill trees, and a few more things. Despite all this, this game still managed to impress me; though I may be biased since I'm mostly saying that because of how many questions it answered. Even though there were many things, such as the AI, which were frustrating, this game still managed to somehow make me continue to want to play it."

This game is just plain fun.  It's a total Run & Gun, Spray & Pray and Kill Everything That Moves type of game.  That's really all there is to the gameplay here, but I don't mind that one bit!

The storylines in the game are somewhat typical and a little boring at times, but still enjoyable in the end.  You can tell that the developers put a lot of time into them, and given the type of game they were going for, they had plenty of room for creativity.

From a visual and auditory standpoint, the game is well done.  Obviously they were going for a comic type of look here, which I think they accomplished very well!  That said, on full ultra settings, the game still don't look half bad!  The sound is pretty nice as well, although certain aspects I felt left a little something to be desired.

All in all, I can't believe I put off playing this series for so long!  I'm hooked on it now, and can't wait to play the rest!"

8599,My lil bro (yes HE'S underaged for the ESRB but who follows those) played this all the time on his ps3 fun as all hell solo may be a tad easier but platying it with co-op can really get quests done better to have a foe surrouned by 2 sides. and you get alot more chances to live longer. if  you want it though i reccomend waiting for it to be on sale more BANG for your buck

*prepares to be attacked*

Ok, ok. For me, Borderlands is the sort of game that has potential to be fun with friends, but you need those friends to actually play with in order to get the most out of this game. Otherwise... it is basically a single-player MMO. And while this has more to do with me than Borderlands... I am SICK of grindy quest MMORPG gameplay. Particularly so when I played this because I had quit WoW for good shortly before someone tossed it to me.

So right out the game, the gameplay and I have an issue that made me less than enthused to play it (or its sequels). But you also get to drive a car buggy thing around that handles so badly I'm surprised when I'm not crashing into stuff while using it. The game menu system is a bit of a mess as well, with far too many steps needed to complete relatively simply tasks. But really... my biggest problem is with how the combat works. It's MMO-like with respawns, stats that sometimes cause you to fail, and... boss fights that let the boss full-heal if you die fighting it. Problem is, if you do die, not only do you have a death penalty in game cash, you also have lost all the ammo you used while fighting it. Your ammo supply does not have the regen value the enemies do. While this game is nothing compared to Dark Souls in terms of difficulty, the annoyance of having to fight your way out of a dungeon, load up maybe 3-4 boss fight attempts worth of ammo, then fight your way back to the boss.... ugh.

If you can get people who will play this with you together, then I guess you can have some fun. If you are likely going to end up playing this solo... no. Just stay away.

Now as for you haters who are going to rage because i've based your popular game... try to attack me... if you can. o_O"

I've never heard of it 'till I saw it on sale this summer and I bought it thinking ""look at this guy (-psycho-) on the game's art.. he's a proper lunatic this one definitely must have story"" [spoiler]sadly he hasn't much. All he wants is to throw his machete and blow things up including himself, kinda like mad max movie scene -witness me![/spoiler] anyway...

The story is about an ancient Vault in a planet called Pandora, rumors say that inside that vault there is Chuck Norri's priceless loot -who knows! and guess what; you're the one badass Vault Hunter that will open it.  My heart started pounding crazy at that point of the story and then... my journey began.

+Character Level system and skills tree to choose one per level
+Fast teleport system
+Halo vehicles! (jeeps)
+psycho fellas
+funny dialogues and xp challedges

-Lack of a codex/journal (lore background)
-Unfulfilled ending 
-Overall easy AI if you play solo (AI gets harder in co-op)
-Lack of a storage chest to put my badass gun collection (edit: added in Mad Moxxi's DLC)
....
It would be grand if I could play solo and the rest of the characters join in like an offline co-op

9/10 ***TK Baha would need more braaaaaaaaaaaaaains! though.

8619,Game was aight.
8620,"[i][b]Borderlands[/b][/i] is honestly one of the best FPS games I have played in a while. Not only did it offer a great story line, but it enhanced the player experience through multiples quests, superb sound quality, and a unique graphic style that was very pleasing to the eye. 

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+  Large amount of quests (216 to be exact)
+  UI was very user friendly and easy to follow
+  Great game to play with friends, however... (listed in Con)
+  An extremely large amount of weapons and gears available
+  Sounds were very realistic and the music, while not the best, was sufficient
+  Graphics were a huge plus (and based off of games that I've played, unique)
+  Game play was challenging, but not too challenging where you couldn't progress
+  Dialogue: usually I like to skip conversations, but these were too good to pass up

[h1]Con[/h1]
-  Lack of a mini-map which threw me off (map available in inventory)
-  A lot, [i]a lot[/i] of DLC's required to make gameplay the best it can be
-  Of course this is preference, but I found that this game was a lot more fun to play with friends; offers a fairly lackluster single-player option
-  Be prepared for some glitches and bugs: While I did encounter a minimal amount, they were enough to make me rage. The one I came across, as I think many others have as well, was in [b]General Knoxx's DLC[/b]. [spoiler]If you decide to loot the hundreds of crates instead of progressing through the quest, you will be barred from entering again (which means you will not be able to complete the quest). Quite silly how they don't allow more than 3 minutes (I think) to loot the crates[/spoiler]

Despite it having been released awhile back, this game gets two thumbs up from me. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

Overall: [h1]8.5/10[/h1]"

8630,"Some years ago me and my friends were always looking for coop games to play and every now and then we'd find one or another. Someday one of them told me and my other friend about this game called 'Borderlands' and we didn't really know what to expect. I mean, I wasn't much excited with the concept (especially when he said that it was a FPS with a Diablo's bias). Anyway, we decided to give it a go so we've selected our classes and we surely had a lot of fun while playing it. Although I've played the DLCs alone, the main game was more than enough to provide a lot of entertainent. If you never tried it before, I surely recommend it. There're many different weapons to choose, classes, skills etc. It's just my modest opinion, but I like it absolutely more than the second game (especially because it doesn't desperately try to be funny and the DLCs are way much better). Anyway, if you're up to it, grab your gear and go kick some butts."
8631,"Great game for the time it came out, but, by 2015 standards, this game is pretty basic, clunky models/textures, really depressing landscape, but that's to be expected on a place like pandora, in short the game is really fun, but just feels like you're never progressing."
8632,"Mad, crazy and funny game for all angry people what always need kill someone :D"
8633,"Pretty good game, might get a bit repetitive, but if you have a group of friends to play with it is well worth the price."
8634,"I origonally played this on the PS3 and I absolutly loved it! It was a lot of fun, running around and killing things, plus I loved the humour involved. The only problem was when you play the game by yourself it gets REALLY dull very fast, but with friends it becomes endless fun! I felt like this game was far better with friends as it can barely hold my attention as a single-player experience and as far as I've seen, I havn't seen any way to join someone like in Dead Island where people of similar Level might come close and you can invite them or they ask to join you.

Either that or Borderlands is just dead as there are man other sequals.

I have one big problem with the DLC however. The packs that give you new areas only have one checkpoint, which is at the begining. This means if you are say, 50% or 75% of the way through the game before you turn it off (either bed, work or something else)  when you return you'll have to make your way ALL the way from the begining of the game.

My fav of it all was Clap Trap's Robot Revolution! It was a hell of a lot of fun, but the anoying thing about the DLCs is that the levels make no sense on newgame+ as that one is the lowest levels, yet was the last DLC made and has bosses in it from the previous DLC.

I say it's worth it if you have friends who have never played this game before and wish to play something with them."
8635,"Some of my fondest memories in gaming are playing Borderlands with my friends.  

It's truly a fun game with a near infinite combination of guns/loot, the occasional hilarious character interactions, and very enjoyable combat.

You'll find yourself wandering the desert, listening to immersive music (A great game to add your own music to listen to in the background while you play.  I preferred listening to Tool albums while playing this game), soaking in the environments/characters, and enjoying the endless loot collection to improve your character.

It says I only have 71 hours of gameplay in this game, but I most likely put over 200 hours of gameplay into it before I purchased it on steam (So 271 hours in total)."
8636,"In my opinion, it's the best game from Borderlands series. Atmosphere, music, specific humor, challenging tasks AND LOTS OF CLAPTRAPS. Even Borderlands 2 or Pre-Sequel has better graphics, more stuff and ect. , bl1 is still my favorite. Thanks a lot, 2k!"
8637,ITS SO MUCH FUN its a really good FPS that can help blow off some steam when that kid around the corner hits you with his bladeded frisbee.
8638,"Best game I have ever played.
10/10 would Borderland again."
8639,I have this game on my xbox 360 also and the graphics on the PC version are so much better. But the game itself is great also as it has plenty of weapons and a great storyline. Plenty of missions and not to mention co-op for later one. This game has plenty of replay value and was worth what I paid for. All I can ultimately say is that you can't go wrong with a borderlands game.
8640,"The best game I ever played.  If you haven't, you should.

Do not mistake what I said, I did not say it is one of the best games I've ever played, I said it is [b]the[/b] best game I have ever played.  I've been a gamer since the early 80's, and every other game I have played in all that time comes up short when compared to Borderlands.

You're reading this because you are trying to decide if you should buy this game.  I am telling you unequivocally to buy this game.  For most games I'd tell you if it's on sale, if you like dragons, if you like sniping, if you own a set of armor, if you have posters of Natalie Portman on your wall, or some such qualifying aspect then I think you would most likely enjoy this game.  However, for Borderlands, it's as simple as if you play video games, you will enjoy Borderlands.  If you don't play video games, I don't know what you're doing here at Steam reading this review, but I caution you not to start with Borderlands, as no other game will ever live up to it.

In short, there are two types of gamers in this world, those who've played Borderlands and those who do not know what they are missing."
8641,"Honestly one of my favorite series and this game started it all.
I'm not a big gamer anymore, school ugh, but this would be my exception.
Not only have I beaten it multiple times, but I even maxed out my monney to $999999999.
Best game in a long time.
Pros:
Fun, varying difficulty, awesome guns, funny characters, if you're looking to play a game mindlessly for hours then you found the right one.
Cons:
Hard to run, don't know why. My pc can run it at max 30fps but 60fps battlefield:/
Missions and glitches get a lil bit repetitive, but overall it's a great game.

Would I recomend this to a friend?
Does my friend have a PC?
If so, the answer is yes!
Unless he has a potato, I hate potatoes."
8642,"This game is a lot of fun. Get quest. Go to point on map. Kill big monster. Get rewarded better gun. Use it to kill even bigger monster and get even bigger gun! Get another quest. Repeat. 

And it's the first RPG First Person Shooter: for that it deserves our respect. It has a fun sense of humor (depending on your taste in humor)  a fun story, and fun mechanics. It's just fun.

I got a lot of play out of it, the main story and every side quest was over in maybe 30 hours, and then playing through all the DLC took me about another 30 hours. All of the DLC are worth it, with the exception of Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot, which is just waves of enemies forever and ever. But if you buy it, you're going to buy the GOTY version, anyways.

I love this game and I don't regret any of the 67 hours I spent playing it. So should you buy it? 

Actually, no. You shouldn't buy it.

Why?

Because Borderlands 2 exists. 

Borderlands 2 is just a better version of everything good from this game, and you're better off spending your time in that game. Unless your computer is 10 years old and can't run it. Then by all means, get Borderlands 1 and have a great time. :)"
8643,Fun game with friends. Somewhat boring. Great atmosphere though.
8644,"Great game, lots of weapons. Has some flaws like the map navigation (fixed in BL2). Engaging story and funny characters. 
8/10"
8645,I love you Gearbox.
8646,Probably the best Borderlands game so far :D Really original
8647,Haven't played it in years. Installed it today. No one is playing. Shot Claptrap. Uninstalled it.
8648,"Good game and a great price.  Towards the end it did start to get a bit repetitive.  But overall, it kept me entertained."
8649,"classic borderlands. not as good as 2 and presequel but a great game nonetheless. Lots of guns, the graphics are pretty cool, 4 player co-op, nothing bad to say about it. Everyone should own it at this point."
8650,"Really awesome game, fluid controls, albeit with some Hitdetection Issues. Would recommend."
8651,"Great game, lot of guns, ..."
8652,"Borderlands is a pretty terrible game. It looks awful nowadays, and I just don't find the aesthetic very pleasing to the eye. It's low quality, is the main problem, the FoV is horrid, and just generally for PC mustard rake, you're going to find it very crap.

It's better with friends, but, pffthahahahaha, who has friends who'll actually play this on PC with you?

Solo, this game is just not fun. It's not. It's boring and bland and one hell of a lonely game. It's empty as all hell and feels like an MMO world, with the grinding intact.

Do you know what other games have grinding for loot? World of Warcraft.

Sorry, but I can't stand this game.

EDIT: once again the dumbass fanboys are out there to give anyone who downvotes their favourite game a fistful of 'fuck you'"
8653,"Badass weapons.



10/10"
8654,"A little older, but GREAT game. Plenty of loot to be had, and long gameplay."
8655,"its so much fun but please can you ade splitscreen 2-4 ?
"
8656,"Has that ""one more run"" kinda feel to it when you are looking for that one upgrade to your build or just fighting through an area for fun. Although there are obviously superior gun archetypes, everything you find is at least usuable. Finding a high quality weapon means that youre set for a while with the way the scaling works in the game. Definetly recommened the game to ARPG fans that are looking to scratch that Diablo itch."
8657,"7.5/10 ~ If this game is your childhood friend= BUY.  If you didn't grow up playing this game=BUY (but buyer beware, for me never having played this game....the hype that had built in my head for 7+ years was a partial let down, but not 100%. If you feel let down, I advise to keep pushing forward and play a few hours before it collects dust in your steam library."
8658,"I highly recommend this game, but it would just be great if the (Logitech) gamepad controls didn't change every single time I booted it up to play."
8659,"I own all 3 of the Borderlands games so that should tell you right there I just love them. This is the first game I have ever enjoyed playing a female character. Normally being a female I play all male characters as I like their skill sets better, but borderlands made their females badass! The Siren in Borderlands is an awesome character to play. She has great skills and I chose to have her use smg's and pistols making her a powerful gal to mess with. I love all the quests in the game and the weapon variety is awesome. If a game lacks weapon variety I have a hard time sticking with it if it is a long play through. Again this is a game you will play through more than once. You have to try all the characters and their skill sets not to mention you miss things the first time through. I played this game the first time through in co-op and as with any game co-op is much more fun. However I did go back and play through on my own because I had so much fun the first time. And lets face it if you play through with friends you just have to prove to yourself you can do it on your own! I would highly recommend this game to anyone as well as all DLC and all the other two Borderlands games that came after it as well!"
8660,"Totally recommend this game for anyone who enjoys FPS and people who just want to shoot ****. This game has a drawn style looking graphics that really make this game unique and enjoyable, especailly when the enemy's head explodes. Good storyline, tons of weapons to choose from, fun vehicles, and pretty funny character dialogues throughout the game. Plenty of hours of gameplay. Oh and an awesome opening song."
8661,Gearbox pulled me into their game by presenting hilarious characters that have their own unique personalities that have acclimated to the post-apocalyptic conditions that Borderlands had in store. Gearbox Software did not disappoint at all when it came to a solid PvE FPS.
8662,"[h1]Oldie but goodie.[/h1]
[b]Borderlands[/b] realizes exactly what it promised - a great shooter and a pretty good ARPG. Farming of items is as in any decent game of this type, addictive. Hours run away quickly when we move smoothly from one task to another all the time killing hundreds of inhabitants of Pandora. Lacked a little bit to perfection. Failure to include a sharing mechanism of items between players, effectively deterred from playing with strangers, and friends are not always online. The script presented here is so vague that it is difficult to be drawn into the story of the search for treasure. What is important is not the goal, but the road itself, and that better overcome with buddies. However, if you have a group to which you can always count on a lot of free time and like to shoot with a gazillion of guns, that Borderlands is a game for you."
8663,"This game is really awesome. The art-style is kool and the missions are awesome. I like the difficulty levels of different areas because it is challenging enough to make you feel good when you complete a mission. I've barely had to grind to level up, not that it's hard to level up in the first place. This game is kool as and creative and yeah just buy it; it's a great single player and multiplayer game."
8664,"Borderlands... It is an awesome co-op game to play with a couple of friends! Borderlands; full of laughs, a new style of gameplay, the custom character trees for you RPG goers, and a massive open world game! The references to old tv shows and video games are priceless and the unique style of graphics was very popular on release. I own the sequel... however wasnt immersed into it as much as I was this title. Would not recommend buying this game if you are going to play it solo the entire time... but if you have a friend or willing to try and find someone through steam to play, it is definetely worth the money (139 hours currently on record)."
8665,Doing this for the thingy
8666,"I RECOMMEND THIS GAME BUY,LOOT,SHOT,SELL,KILL,AIM,SEARCH.......... AND OTHER COOOOOL STUFF!"
8667,"The key strengths of Borderlands lie in its art direction, gun combat and sheer absurdity.

Borderlands doesn't take itself too seriously and that really helps me recommend this game. The story is very much unremarkable and I often found myself forgetting there even was a story - but there's just enough story to let the player know why their character is there. Admittedly some of the side mission trees do have nice little narratives to them, but I think the main selling point of Borderlands doesn't lie in its storytelling and I don't think it ever sold itself as such.

The combat on the other hand, I haven't had this much fun in FPS combat in quite some time! I get vibes of the old shoot and pray shooters, hordes of enemies after you and you've got loads of guns. The action is very fast paced and straightforward. Some enemies absorb more damage than others, perhaps switch out a different weapon. Maybe trade off speed of firing for damage. Shoot and dodge. The Mad Moxxi underdome riot DLC fully exploits this mechanic - it's worth a gander for sure. Combat is not particularly difficult, as long as you level up appropriately.  Find a gun with some nice stats, make sure you have some ammo - and just go wild! 

The RPG elements of the game are fun too. Levelling up your character can take a while but is ultimately rewarding as it enables you to really gain a lot of power to drive the game forward. I tried to do as many side missions as I could, so much so the end boss was quite the pushover from all the levelling up I did. The shops are mostly easily accessible so it's not hard to remain stocked up. Thr RPG aspect of the game is solid, nothing special but what it does, it does competently, and this contributes to my recommendation for the game.

Whereas I have established a lack of overall story - there's one this game has a lot of, and that's personality. The characters are usually explained well, and I really enjoyed the voice acting. The dialogue, in it's context, does sound really natural. Probably due to hiring good voice actors I suppose. The visual art direction of the game also lends a lot of personality - the cell shading, almost comic book style is particularly alluring. I love the introductory splash screen each key character gets. It just makes the next boss or key character seem like a big deal.

Overall, I liked the game. Fun fast paced combat, lots of personality, nice to look at. Thumbs up worthy, as far as I'm concerned."

8675,"Whew! How to describe one of the most expansive gaming worlds I've ever played in? Borderlands is a massive world of whimsically numerical fun (you'll get it once you shoot someone). Heavily inspired by Mad Max, the setting is like Road Warrior mated with Akira. Cartoonish, with an oddly interesing cast of characters, each with their own peculiarities/ idiosyncracies. The base game has a good enough story, but what gets this game above a 90% (other than the Eridian Promontory and The Descent, both of which feature the best enemies in the game) are the DLCs. Each are such a complete departure from the standalone game, that they add immensely different experiences to an otherwise predictable one. The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned has the best atmosphere, hands-down (spooky and haunting), but the Secret Armory of General Knoxx takes the games' substantial lust for high-tech loot to its' logical conclusion with a massive stockipile of the finest weaponry Pandora has ever seen (not to mention the toughest boss!).
9.7/10"
8676,"Meat bicycles you say?
I'd buy that for a dollar."
8677,"let me say this. it's freakin' awesome. once you hit lvl 5, before that it's okay. 

pros:
- awesome graphics
- lots of weapons to choose from
- the classes (aka the mercenaries) don't have to use one type of weapon, the sniper can have a pistol and a assualt rifle and not even touch a sniper rifle, if so choosen, but the skills won't help that combo though. 
- freedom to walk around and kill things (even during missions!)
- tough enemies, lvls for enemies and different weapons for each type of enemie
- lots of loots, you'll occasionally find a weapon better or on par with your current weapon(s)
cons:
- availability of buying more ammo is delayed until you finish your 3rd or arround the 4th or 5th quest in the beginning of the game, instead of having it available at the beginning."
8678,the guns in this game are so awesome i wish they had kept the same feel to guns in the latter games

8684,This game is like Diablo shooter v3. Highly recommend! 10/10 (Sequels are even better)
8685,"I do have to say that I still enjoyed the game VERY much in single-player,as there are many saying it's only likable when playing with friends. This may be my own preference,but I like single-player better,and found this game to be completely enjoyable and playable that way."
8686,"Awesome game, sniper class with the headshots"
8687,"Fun to play with friends, but kinda boring by yourself.  I highly recommend if you like shooters with ridiculous dialog and multiplayer"
8688,"Incredibly boring and slow game, if you like the pure-FPS genre, this game is not for you."
8689,"It took me about 6 years to finish this game. I even managed to finish Borderlands 2 before Borderlands 1. Somehow the story wasn't that interesting.....I always played it like 1 or 2 hours then I put it back on the shelf. (Yes I have the CD version of this game too).

Only con that I can think of is the damn FOV.....can't change it from the options. I found a way to bind different fov on my F11, and it fixed my FOV only temporely."
8690,"I played 2 first because I got it for free with my video card, and loved it so much I came back to play the original.  This game is every bit as good, and it doesn't feel like anything is lost or that I'm playing an aged game compared to the newer sequel."
8691,It is good to play this game again. just need some people to play online
8692,"An excellent single-player shooter (this game is too old to find multiplayer in any useful capacity). Though fairly typical in structure, Borderlands is a fun stroll through a brutally violent alien wasteland. I personally enjoyed the weapon selection, which comes from a few different ""competing"" weapon manufacturers: even once you're been around the block with this game, it can be challenging to play the game using weapons made by only one of these companies (they all have strenghts and weaknesses)."
8693,Such an awesome game highly recommend it just amazing.
8694,Borderlands is fun game. You can make-ed da pew pew and da blat blat and shoot the bad guys. Much fun. And you can hit people.

8696,"The Original Borderlands is a Classic.  

10/10"
8697,"Borderlands being one of my favourite game franchises. The original one here, is a great game to start of with when wanting to get into the borderlands series, IMO the playable vault hunters in this game are some of the best, if not the best with the exception of Roland the commando, I was never really a fan of the comando class ;P Loads to explore, and missions galore, enough for many hours of gameplay!"
8698,"Borderlands made me appreciate FPS games and that's saying a lot. I love the graphics and the soundtrack of this game. It took me six years to finally play this game but I blazed through it for 5 days. I'm already on the second playthrough on my main character, and I have just created a second one with a different class last night. Fun Fun Fun! <3"

8706,The game that swaped me from halo to fallout. Really goddamn good. Buy it. Play it. Buy it for friends. Play it with friends. Profit.
8707,"There are FPS games, and the is Borderlands. Crazy game with 4 different characters, each have psycho skills, that never get you board. You can play alone, with friends and even play the game once again after you finish it with Playthrough 2. So get your ass up and start level up, because you always can find better weapons for higher levels."
8708,"Major gripe here: Ridiculous, convoluted and infuriatingly buggy DRM verification procedure.  Requires the use of a specific 'granting tool' to load the game from Steam, rendering the physical DVDs that I purchased utterly worthless. 

The entire SecureROM team should be bound, gagged and thrown butt-naked into an IKEA ball-pit full of rabid weasels.

Graphics: Meant to be cute and 'cartoony', but they are in fact remarkably horrible.

Once one gets past Borderlands' most obvious deficiencies, gameplay becomes little more than a bog-standard FPS peppered with fetch quests, desperately futile Zerg-rush combat encounters and extortionate vending machines.  

I honestly can't see what all the fuss is about.  On the whole, I'd rather play Team Fortress 2.

Rating: 3/10"
8709,"For some reasons, I came to this part of Borderlands after completing 3rd and 2nd.
And let me say: it is magical. The same post-apocalyptic world, incredible soundtrack written by
Jesper Kyd and the same mad atmoshpere as well. And this is awesome. So here's my advice: if you
haven't tried it yet, it's high time to play. It worth it. Unforgettable atmosphere of Borderlands is 10/10!"
8710,WHY DON'T YOU OWN THIS?!
8711,"Borderlands is a pretty fun game, spent a while in it and enjoyed the hell out of the missions in co-op and singleplayer. The story is about as thin as a wet tissue paper, but that isn't too much of a concern because you are a treasure hunter looking for treasure. what else do you want? I highly reccomend Borderlands, because it is one of the last games Gearbox has made before their games overrall quality started taking a sharp nose dive."
8712,This game is a synthetic orgasm

Recommended if you get it on any sale
"
8717,"A great game with a lot of personality.  Personally, I didn't love it when I started playing on my own, but it's really good in co-op for some reason.  Even though when I played it, I basically had lag all the time and couldn't hit anything, I still had a great time.

One thing that annoyed me was the the special skill for my character seemed really messed up.  I had a bird that you could send to attack your enemies, but it wouldn't attack enemies that you couldn't see.  That seemed pretty dumb considering that I was usually sending the bird out when I had low health and was hiding behind cover."

8719,"Borderlands is actually a pretty simple game. Right from the outset the concept of the game is pretty clear, you pretty much complete missions, level up and get better loot. But i've gotta tell you. It's a really fun game. I really like the art style and the graphics are really good for the time and still hold up decently even today. Unfortunately, it is a port. It's not the worst port, but it's not the best either. Some of the controls are a little qwerky and aiming sometimes feels a bit off. I was also dissapointed by the lack of options in the menu. The real big one is there isn't an FOV slider. The FOV in this game is really narrow and I've never had this in a game but I can't play it for longer than about 1/2 hours without feeling a bit funny. Anways, there are tools avaliable outside the game that can help you with this. All that aside, this really is a great game that is packed with so much content that just the main game will probably take you 25hrs to complete. The DLC is top quality too offering a few hours worth of content on top of the original game. Worth the money."
8720,Fun story very much enjoyed it.
8721,"EVERY THING SHALL DDDDDDIIIIIEEEEE!!!!!!!!!

lots  of guns"
8722,"This game is tiring.

Story is nonexistant, characters are not interesting, combat is boring, environment is brown and it's one of the few games that give me simulation sickness even with increased fov (non trivial and not permanent) and decrased head bobing (it still moves around while running).

I wanted to enjoy it because I really liked Borderlands 2 but this game is so flawed that it's really not worth it."
8723,"BORDERLANDS:
I must say Very good start Of Borderlands series  In my opinion.
It Pulls us into the very story Borderlands And Describes 
what other Borderlands series will be about,About Vault Hunting,
About Friendships and Big Load of guns.
Graphics are very promising for first part of Borderlands series,
Voice acting is amazing and It has Quite of a story

10/10
I enjoyed it much :)"
8724,"Boring. The world feels dead and empty, the loot is mostly very crappy and you get to upgrade you're gear very rarely. There isn't much variation on enemies, they're all the same, every are seems to have same type of enemies. The story is uninteresting and dull. The skill trees are very limited and have lot of useless skills. Borderland it tagged RPG, but this game is not RPG, not even remotely, just because you have some (crappy) skill tree on the game, doesn't make it RPG. It might be little better played as CO-OP, but nowadays there isn't many games, this game seems to be made for CO-OP as playing singleplayer some mission bosses, even when they are trivial level already, have too much HP, so it takes lot of time before it dies.  I really can't see why so many people seems to like it."
8725,good game to play with friend
8726,Greatest. Game. Ever.
8727,"If you're a fan of the ""Lootin' n Shootin'"" genre, this game is for you. While it might not be as pretty or fleshed out as the succeeding titles, it still holds up remarkably well even to this day and has plenty to offer in terms of gameplay. Not to mention the fact that if you buy the Calptrap's New Robot Revolution DLC, you finally get the chance to kill (literally hundreds) of Claptraps any way you like. If that's not a major selling point then I don't know what is."

8735,"When I first played borderlands the fiurst thing that caught my eye was the art work for the game. The cmoic book feel of the game is beautiful and a very welcome departure from the race for ever more realism. The game itself plays really well. The character skills account for a variety of play styles. And along with the comic book graphics comes great comedy. Packaged in a nice FPS/

Borderlands has a very rich weapon system. With random generation of weapon attributes, you even get to choose waht weapon to use according to your playstyle. 

It will definitely give you hours of enjoyment."

(played on Xbox primary)"
8740,"This game is pretty fun IF you have at least one friend to play with you. If not than it is not that fun, is ok. That's one of the reason I never really touch the game for so long. But now I have a friend to play with, it is pretty good.

Lots of weapons to loot, good graphic, crazy enermies lol, they say a lot  of crazy things. 

The only down side to play with  freinds is, you have to divide the loot amoung your friends. But is ok if your freind is not an asshole hahaha. I suggest that each of your freinds say what type of weapons they mainly use ahead, so other people try not to loot it? Let's say I mainly use Rifle, SMG and Pistol ; your other friend use Sniper rifle, shot gun and whatever. That can work out fine.

Highly recomanded if you have freinds to play with you. If not, try to buy few copies for your freinds that like this kind of game and  never play it be4 to play with you lol.

8741,"One of the most entertaining shooters I've ever played, easily a 10/10.

Must buy for Borderlands 2 fans."
8742,Good game nothing special but worth to buy.
8743,"Amazing game. 100000000000000 weapons, funny story lines and great characters."
8744,"Fantastic game, the most fun I've had in a long time in an FPS.   Great alone and with friends.  Give it a shot."
8745,merda de hit box ...
8746,Great game! I prefer this title over the other entries in the series. Definitely worth a playthrough even if you aren't interested in shooters.
8747,Great.
8748,Knolpower
8749,great game lots of fun
8750,Its fun in the bum.
8751,joined a random game and 2 level 69s (hehe) FLOODED me with weapons that did 2147483614x8 damage 11/10 -ign
8752,Amazing
8753,everyone probably knows this is an amazing game.
8754,one of the best games ever created
8755,I learned how to use cars too damn late...
8756,"Here is my Review for this game:

Positive:

+ Good Backgrounds
+ Nice Music
+ Interesting handling and Gameplay
+ Die Robot!
+ gamemechanics were good


Negative:
- too few weps to choose from
- grinding is surely ok, but it was kinda boring to me
- I missed some dodge mechanic


I give this Game about 75%. it sure is appealing, but it isn't really a Game for me. Maybe Bordlerands 2 will be better? Well else, i recommend it to ppl who love fps-grinding."
8757,"This game is something i can recommend to anyone who likes ""shoot & loot"" type of games."
8758,"It's a fun game, and I liked it, but it has it's... problems.

My friends and I got this game from Humble Bundle (the 3 of us).

Pro:
-The game has some humor
-I like the style of the game
-Cool looking guns and cars (I mean the cars in General Knoxx)
-Nice looking places

Cons:
-IDK if it was buggy for us, but we barely changed our weapons. Everything we found (let that be a common or an ultra rare gun, white or purple) was crap. We were running around with weapons from 10 levels before, which were green/purple. Maybe it was bugged for us, but the drop system was cr#p
-Quests are sometimes boring. And too fking much running. Like, we get our quest at A, go to the other side of the planet, to B, killed some monsters, go back to A, and we get the next quest which sends us back to B.... that was annoying!
-Music is great, but it was rare. Mostly the boring desert songs. Made the walking more boring.
-In the General Knoxx DLC we always went with cars, but the distance between A and B was even bigger! Boring driving from A to B
-My friend was sad because there's no minigun. Would be great for the Berserker.



I'm waiting for a Humble Bundle that gives us the Borderlands 2, I hope the drop system will work better

and please, pleaseeee

no more fking walking/driving for miles!"
8759,"You probably know the deal by now: kill things, level up, buy better weapons, kill stronger things. This game can be extremely addicting, especially with friends. My only complaints are substandard performance (running on a 4GB card, wtf) and Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot being some of the laziest DLC since Oblivion's horse armor. It's worth the full price of entry, but it frequently drops to $4.99 if you're uncertain that you'll enjoy the hours upon hours of content packed into this game.

Oh, and the ending sucks."
8760,"the only way I can imagine to try inform you about how borderlands will make you feel is this, imagine having the perfect girlfriend, she's gorgeous, she loves all the same hobbies you do, she plays games with you, she'll even do the best home cooked meals for plus she's smart and interesting.except every night she rapes you,and for some reason you enjoy it..... So yeah I recommend it and I give it 4.5/5 sexually deranged super girlfriends"
8761,"Great Art Style, Great Design, Great Soundtrack, Great Story, Excellent Game Play and a Massive Collection of Weapons, simply a must have Masterpiece. Plays like a FPS, feels like a RPG, and progresses like a good film. Great memories shall be shared when played among friends, if its on sale, I suggest picking it up and maybe even getting a few extra copies for friends to roll together!!"
8762,"Such a great game! 

I put alot of time into this game on Xbox 360 back in the day and am still enjoying it after purchasing it recently on my Laptop.. Would recommend it to anyone!"
8763,"Funny FPS, Good characters, Leveling up and skills."
8764,"Hundreds of hours of gameplay on the ps3 about a dozen on pc
 i can tell you this is one hell of a game amazing loot and shooter and one of the funniest games ive ever played 
compared to borderlands 2 it has a much better loot system better more unique weapons and a larger enemy prescence 
the Atlas corporation is much scarier and felt much more real than hyperion
the story is lacking compared to borderlands 2 but with a group of friends and the general knoxx dlc it is much more enjoyable"
8765,no dont do it
8766,"Great game, never get tired, lot's of content, things to do, and lots of fun garanteed!"
8767,"Solid game, feels really raw and gritty compared to other FPS games, great 4 player Co-Op, DLCs add hours apon hours of gameplay, 100% replay value"
8768,"Nice Game
10/10"
8769,"Love it. Just love it. The lore, atmosphere and humor. Cartoony graphics that gives it a nice touch. A very good fps game with a hint of rpg. Cus the game is a bit old, you'll need to tweak the config files for maximum comfort. Don't worry, they have good step-by-step explanations for these at gearbox forums."
8770,"When it first came out I was taking a hiatus from gaming. Fortunately, my lil brother asked for Borderlands when it came out so I bought it for him on his steam account. Almost 6 years later, I decided to install it and try it out. Borderlands instantly became one of my all time favorite games. I had to buy the 2nd one right after (luckily I got it during the sale) By far one of my favorite series. Get the first 2 for sure"
8771,"Amazing game, tons of fun, you should try it if you didnt play it so far!"
8772,"A little bit of Fallout, a little bit of Mad Max and you're set: Borderlands! An amazing FPS with comic-like graphics and RPG elements. Very enjoyable!"
8773,Easily in my top 5 games ever played.
8774,"It came out when I was in junior high school, watching the trailer make me wants to play this game, and I think this game is gonna be big, as the idea was not mainstream. And yep, after a long wait I played this game. Just like what I though, it is a really BIG GAME, this game got so many anti-mainstream on it, that's why I loved it so much. And then DLC after DLC coming. And finally the journey comes to the successor: Borderlands 2, that got way sooooooo many features and improvement."
8775,"I finally finished the original campaign of Borderlands today. One of the things I've always adored about this game is it's comic book art style. It looks fantastic and taking advantage of this style means it has aged extremely well. At this point it's 5 or 6 years old but still totally playable, that couldn't be said of some games.

Combat is fun, gunplay has plenty of options and choosing different types of equipment mixes your character up enough to have it worth a difference. Overall a very fun shooter, my own gripe is the story is a little hard to follow/understand and reading quest text is very annoying in this day and age."
8776,"i love this game. i think it could be one of the best so far. maybe the 1st one but it is the best. i think that anyways lol.

would recormend this game to anyone."
8777,"+fun gunplay
+creative writting(especially in dlcs)
+unique artstyle
+multiple playable characters
+amazing replay value
-can be too easy or too hard depending on playstyle
-lackluster vanilla story
+/-mostly desert(I enjoy this but others prolly won't)
buy this game if you enjoy killing people that are on fire, or shotguns firing faster than rifles"
8778,Watch the story of Borderlands 1 on YouTube. Then buy Borderlands 2.
8779,Great game! Interesting environment and great for co-op!
8780,its really fun the first time you play the game.
8781,"I've always loved Borderlands, as it has SO much to discover, yet never really feels too much like a grind.
The performance of this game is great, even on older systems and I like the balance between ""RPG"" and FPS. The humour is outstanding and it will just make you come back for more.

Highly recommend if you like FPS games with a touch of RPG, a solid story and lots of humour."
8782,Classic game that started it all.
8783,"""Oh come on lets get down! Come on everybody, check me out, I'm dancin', I'm dancin'!""

unz unz unz unz

10/10"
8784,better than borderlands 2
8785,This is like FPS Diablo.
8786,"Borderlands is a sci-fi action game that combines the best elements of first-person action with player customization and massive arsenal of weaponry.
Play as one of four mercenaries in this amazing experience as the player adventures himself in the lawless planet of Pandora, focused on finding powerful alien technology, also known as The Vault.
This game also features an amazing cooperative experience, allowing up to 4 players to play the campaign simultaneously and the game's content provides an near-endless variety in missions, environments, enemies, weapons and character customization.
Fun is guaranteed with Borderlands and it's definitely one of the best games I've ever played.
I highly recommend Borderlands aswell as all of the content released."
8787,Great Co-Op fun
8788,Get Friends.
8789,"Borderlands is a fantastic FPS-RPG.  It's like Diablo with guns!  There's plenty to do:  Skill trees for each class, lots of challenges and quests, and TONS of loot!!!  I enjoy it much more with friends, like most people.  Borderlands 2 is a much better game, but this is still worth getting and playing first!"
8790,"It's the fun, fast & loose shooter that started a wonderful franchise. The only problem is that it's too easy. You level up ridiculously fast, letting you mow down even the final boss with yawn-inducing ease. Still a good game to buy if you want to roll into the shooter genre with something that's not too challenging"
8791,if you wanna shhot some badd asses and get cool guns you should get this game
8792,"Fun Game.  Must be played with a friend, or else its a little slow"
8793,"The cartoon-ish art style has really helped this game age rather well. I had a lot of fun with this back in the day on console and then DVD PC version. Replaying the digital version even in today's day the game looks and plays still great.

The original Borderlands wacky shooter with tons of guns, guns, guns. Full of totally stupid and silly characters/bosses. All set in a sci-fi world with a frontier type vibe. The gunplay can be bullet spongy. The driving is not the best. The quests not that memorable. Still this game turned out to be a  I whole load of dumb fun. 

It has all the fun gameplay of Borderlands 2, but lacked any great central  story or villain like Handsome ( a-hole trolling ) Jack. Then again story and narrative can get old with any constant replays. So all that is left is the fun of the gameplay and this is still a fun shooter to game on for sure.

Absurdist rank ""C""."
8794,aswesome game to play with you wife :D
8795,"Watch your back, there's Midget Psychos that will cut your arm off."
8796,Best. Game. Ever.
8797,"Saw things, shot 'em, they exploded.

... fun game."
8798,"Borderlands fan? Buy it. 
New to this game? Buy it."
8799,"Love this game, even if you own Borderlands 2 I would give the first a try"
8800,"Borderlands is a great First person shooter. It mixes a lot of shooting with a mind numbing amount of guns and loot. There is where the game really excels. Most of the time, you will be walking around, looking for enemies, getting money and/or loot and buying better equipment.

Rinse and repeat.

And no, it does not get old. At least, not soon. The amount of different types of characters you can play adds quite a lot to the replayability value. Add to this the ability to play in 4-coop mode, and you have a really great game. I got the GOTY edition, with the DLCs.

Definitely, a must have,"
8801,"Super fun co-op game where loot is the goal. Plenty of side quests that will keep you shooting. Story is pretty bland, but its just enough to keep you interested. 

If you're a good FPS player this game will get very very easy as you level up and get stronger. There is a difficulty slider mod that is very easy to use and works great! Makes the game much more difficult and keeps you playing."
8802,"Very good game! The ending is very unexpected! Big replay value!
IGN 11/10 WOULD BUY AGAIN :)!"
8803,f@%$ing awesome
8804,"Borderlands, This is one of my favorite games i have ever played. This game is old, a bit dated, but the gameplay is fantastic, i enjoyed this game more than Borderlands 2. i would highly suggest you buy this game and give it a try."
8805,"Not recommended for the solo experience as it is very clearly designed around multiplayer co-op. The plot is thin and extra content gets stale quickly. That said if one is looking to get into a game that has effectively transposed the ARPG feedback loop of loot gain for the sake of loot gain to a FPS format, this is the game for you."
8806,"A great game with some really annoying game design.  First, there is some really annoying platforming as characters constantly get stuck on geometry.  Second, there are. 'Find such and such' quests where the markers are wrong and you need to platform to get them.  Without YouTube help, I wouldn't have finished the game.  Finally, the climax is a dull corridor sequence.  On and the dlc isn't great.

Still, it is a.worthwhile game, just expect jank."
8807,"great game, much fun"
8808,Worst game ever.

8812,"i haven't played any other borderlands except this one and bl2, but i like this one better."
8813,"I bought this because I bought the DLC by accident on the PS3, and f**k that was a good accident. I've played this for about 300+ hours on the PC and PS3
When you start thinking that this game cant get any better this game says f**k you and your low expectations and gives you a game that is not only funny but has great gameplay and amazing replayability."
8814,Kill Bandits see Badass Bandits run away than die and die again
8815,The game that showed all of us to an awesome song
8816,Good Game
8817,"It's a good game and all, but it's not as good as Borderlands 2 or Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! If you look to play a game in this series, I recommend to play either Borderlands 2 or the Pre-Sequel.

Yes, I recommed it over most other FPS games, but I personally wasn't too big a fan of it compared to Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel."
8818,"Borderlands: GOTY Edition is a fun game to play co-op with friends in a Mad Max kind of alien world. Difficulty increases based on the number of players (max 4 players) but you are also rewarded with better loot drops. Although you can perform melee attacks, range weapon is where it's at when it comes down to combat. There is also some 4-wheeling vehicle combat. Character customization comes from changing only the color palette of your outfit, choice of weapons, weapon and shield mods, and skill points allocation. Once you obtain a certain combination of weapon and shield mods, the combat becomes alot easier (almost too overpower). There are many side missions and DLCs for a change of pace. Replayability is achieved only after you've finished the primary story line. This second play through offers increased combat difficulty and better loot drops, as well as the opportunity to further increase your character level. But you are better off to just proceed to Borderlands 2. Overall: 8/10"
8819,One of my favortie series and it started with this game.
8820,"Really loved this game! Was sooo much fun to play and I'm definitely gonna play it again a few times! If you love humour and laughing hard at stupid sh!t then this game is for you! Crazy screaming midgets running everywhere, and some really cool boss fights! The game is rich with many humourous characters you'll come to love and enjoy! You'll hear some of the cheesiest one-liners that'll make you rip yourself laughing! And lets not talk about the 1000's of guns you get in this game, this game is worth gold! Best FPS RPG you'll ever play...

10/10 Would kill all those midgets again"
8821,"probably randy ""squirting is magic"" pitchford's last decent game"
8822,This is the best GAME EVER!!!! CAnt wait to get my hnds on borderlands 2 and the presequal!!!!!
8823,Borderlands an icon of awesome.  Buy this and then commence to shooting stuff in the face.  So much fun.
8824,"Fun, fun, fun. Shoot and Loot at its finest. Don't let the age put you off - this is fresh and the texture-light art style means it can run on a low-spec laptop. Or if you do have a modern gaming machine, switch on DX10 for more shininess."
8825,"this game is one of the best FPS on steam, Its got a great story, funny moments, and you can play it for the tenth time and its still fun."
8826,It's ok.
8827,Diablo and Call of Duty had a baby. His name is Borderlands.
8828,get it NOW
8829,"An outstanding game that Gearbox has ever made that brings both RPGs & FPS into our PCs and Consoles with Weapon XP and Level XP Gaining from games like Diablo and Ratchet & Clanks 1-14! It's the game that Gearbox sold over 2-3 Million Copies for PC/Xbox 360/PS3 & PS4.

This is a must have for Every gamer out there along with its 4 DLC Packs. Personally, I prefer the Borderlands Triple Pack for the PS3 in which you can have it all; All 3 Borderlands games plus the DLC or the PS4's GOTY Edition which has this game plus all the DLC.

Its with this game, Gearbox Software would skyrocket to the top of the Gaming Industry with Borderlands becoming the fastest selling game in 2009."
8830,Fantastic game!
8831,"Borderlands is a fun and addicting fps mix with rpg, it is a game that you can play for hours and hours and not get bored"
8832,GUNS GUNS GUNS GUNS
8833,"(If you read this review and notice that I have a low amount of hours, I have played both this and Borderlands 2 on the Xbox 360 for many hours)


Borderlands is a First-Person Shooter with RPG elements such as levels, skill trees, and quests. The game takes place in Pandora, a post-apocalyptic looking planet filled with murderous creatures, bandits and lunatics as well as a grand treasure known as the Vault. People who search for the Vault are known as Vault Hunters. You play as one of four Vault Hunters: Mordecai, the Sniper, who excels in sniping (Obviously) and uses his pet bird Bloodwing as his signature move, Lilith, the Siren, who uses her signature move ""Phasewalk"" to go invisible as well harm foes, Brick, the Berserker, who is gigantic and uses his fists as his signature move, and Roland, the soldier, who uses his turrert as his signature move. These four are guided by a mysterious being known as their Guardian Angel on their quest to finding the vault.

Pros:
-This game has loads of weapons (Over 10,000,000 different weapons thanks to its Randomly Generated Loot system)
-Game is quite humorous, as well as being full of references
-This game is more fun with friends
-This game takes a good while to complete, and with Playthrough 2 and 2.5, which starts the game over but your character data carries over and enemies become stronger, it has lots more replayability
-The PvP modes are quite fun with friends
-Does not need a whole lot to run
-Game has improved on PC thanks to SteamWorks
-Playthrough 2.5 isn't as broken as Ultimate Vault Hunter mode in Borderlands 2
-After beating the game, you can change which Playthrough to play on.


Cons:
-Side missions feel like fetch quests, where as in Borderlands 2 the side missions have little stories
-Falling Damage. Since I first played the second game, I was pretty ticked off that there was falling damage in here.
-There's virtually no story unlike Borderlands 2.
-V-Sync, Anti-Aliasing and FOV are unavailable through normal means. You'll have to use ini tweaks or external tools.

Great game, especially with friends! 8.5/10
"
8834,Recommended
8835,5/5 would burn bandits again
8836,"This isnt really a review, but rather it is why I think more people should play this game. (The screen before this was asking me to tell my friends why they should play).

You like Borderlands 2 right? If you play Borderlands 1 you will have a richer experience in Borderlands 2 or TPS. Not many people are online, but if you really love Borderlands you should play this. A pioneer in the filed of chaos mathematics and a revolutionary biologist think that if you experience things in the order they were created you will have a better understanding of the latest thing. For instance if you read the material from the presocratics it will be easier for you to understand Plato. This is due to something called a morphogenetic field. Its super interesting look it up. It's like the tenth monkey effect. 

Suffice to say that if you play bl1 you will have a richer experiene of bl2 according to this morphogenetic field theory. Msg me if your interested in this theory I will explain it better.

IME playing bl1 made bl2 better for me."
8837,"One of the best games I've ever played, and one of my personal favorites. If you like shooting midgets with a rocket launcher and running over wildlife, then this is the game for you."
8838,Unload all your ammo on an enemy with no armour and watch as they just don't die.
8839,"Not as good as I was expecting.   Poor graphics and its basically a 1st person World of Warcraft.  I was really excited to play this game but I get bored while playing it and day dream about playing other games, then i just turn it off and go play other games.  It requires you to do the same dungeons over and over to get the gear you need to complete the next quests and dungeons which is annoying, you dont keep weapons for very long because you constantly find better weapons which is fine it just feels like you didnt accomplish much by getting the last one.  A lot of people liked it so I say give it a shot when its on sale sometime, otherwise there are plenty of better games out there."
8840,I wanted BL2 wtf
8841,"The begin of a to-come masterpiece in my opinion.

[h1]PLOT[/h1]
Pandora, an hostile planet for his creatures and bandits. Here on this planet fables tell about a place called Vaul: it is said that who will open it will have anything, from richness to fame. You are a vault hunter whos aim is open the Vault for have the power, but it will be harder than it seems: bandits and a private army of a corporation will be on your way to stop your achieve, but luckily you can count on plenty of allies. Will you reach to open the Vault and have all you ever wished?

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Borderlands is a FPS mixed with RPG. It can be played singleplayer, but with friends you will have much more fun (max 4 people). Weaponry is composed by pistols, SMGs, shotguns, rifles, rocket launchers snipers and eridian weapons. There is also the chance to drive a car called Runner, which must be always used for moving in the different areas otherwise it becomes stressful going around on foot. The vehicle can be customized with 10 different colors and it can bring only two people: one drives and other one use the sentry, which can be a machine heavy gun or a rocket launcher. The car can be created on a Catch-a-ride station: you can create two of them. The difficulty can be easy at first but after finishing the main story you will unlock the ""Hard mode"", in case u want much more competition. Approximate time for completing the game with secondary quests included is 20-30 hours. Every character has his own special action (kind of super power) and a skill tree, which is divided in three subtrees:
[list]
[*] Blue Tree
[*] Red Tree
[*] Green Tree
[/list]
Every skill tree give different power ups, which can go from special action power-up to weapon and melee damage to shield and health performance. You can choose how to set points but its recommended to follow a tree basing on your preferences. Points can be resetted to a customization station but you must pay for it so be careful. The station can be also used for changing the colors of your character. Last important thing about characters is the weapon skill. More you a particular weapon, more the skill weapon bar will increase. When you reach a new level, the damage, accuracy and stability with that type of weapon will increase permanently.
Models of weapons are a lot similar to each other: they can be distinguished by colors. Every color represents the material grade of a manufacturer, which give different buffs to a weapon.
[b]Example:Hyperion weapons are red, and they have very high recoil reduction and accuracy, while Dahl ones have various camouflage patterns with high recoil reduction at the cost of accuracy.[/b]

[h1]Ambience[/h1]
Planet ambience goes from arid desert and lands to coasts, yards/hills of debris, snowy mountains, rivers and bandits-military bases, towns and caverns. A cool feature is the passages of the days (from night to day and from day to night).

8842,"if sufer from insomnia, this game will fix that"
8843,"It's a great game. If you're really looking for some fun. Get the GOTY Edition. It has all four DLC which are great in thier own right. 

This game doesn't have as many different envronments as BL2 but it does keep the aura of a barren wasteland.

Grab a gun
Have some fun
Just shoot and run
and call it done."
8844,just buy it.
8845,This game is a classic that i would recommend to anyone
8846,Just Amazing <3
8847,Must have!!!
8848,"Great in SP, fucking dogshit in MP.

Also, COME GET THE LOOT BOYS!!!!!!!"
8849,it would not work for me it said general proptecion fallined
8850,7kt
8851,Borderlands is extremly addictive and (in my opinion) better than the second. With more guns and better shooting it beats it. Overall very good game and you cn get real cheap on sale.
8852,
8853,"- All around terrible clunky UI that makes managing/buying/selling guns a painful process. Clearly this was designed for consoles and not considered beyond that.
- You can only track 1 objective of 1 quest at once (and only the host can track quests in the first place). This makes you constantly run back and forth.
- Co-op often fails to save every player's progress (even though it promises to save all progress), forcing you to redo quests.

+ There's plenty of variety in guns.
+ There are many quests where you have to find hidden objects. It's a fresh change from the monotonous shooting.
+ Level design actually gets more impressive towards the end instead of focusing on hooking players in the beginning.

It's alright fun to play as co-op, but definitely not worth many dollars."
8854,"Borderlands is a great fps game to play, especially if you're with friends. Even if it is old, it holds up due to the gameplay and story mixed with humor. Graphics aren't very up to date but its still fun."
8855,"The 94% ""yes"" votes are correct, this is a pretty fun game. Normally not into FPS but the dialogue is witty and the combat interesting. Look forward to playing the second one."
8856,This pretty much hits everything i could want in a game headshots and character leveling.  Great fun classes hours of good DLC addons. I highly recommend this game.
8857,"One of my favorite games of all time. Great gameplay, great content, great feel to the quests, and overall a real good game. For sure one of the greatest FPS-RPG's out there. It still continues to be my favorite game series to this day."
8858,Yes to everything.  It's a great shooter for everyone including beginners as you learn as you level up.
8859,👍
8860,"I wasn't sure about Borderlands when i first seen it, the cel shading put me off a little, but this is without a doubt one of the best multi co-op games to date. It is a huge game and its replay value means you get your moneys worth and then some."
8861,Really good game. It says there is only partial controller support but the main thing I have noticed is that it just lists the keyboard controls instead of the ones for the controller.
8862,"I murdered a few midgets then did a drive by in the middle of the desert
nuff said 10/10"
8863,here's my first review. i like borderlands for it's low end graphics so that it can be played on lower performance comuters. i'ts  a fun fps rpg with the wide range of loot and the second playthrough allows for more time to scavenge all the best guns you want to get in the game.
8864,"Not much can be said about an open world role playing game, except his one stood out from the crowd for the simple reason that it was done in a comic book style. Quirky characters and a plot not unreasonable, makes this a worth while experience."
8865,How do you like them apples?
8866,An entertaining game with lots of killings and trolling. Briliant!
8867,"I love Borderlands 2. It was the first of the series I played. I guess that was a bad move. Everything about Borderlands 2 was awesome. I picked up Borderlands 1 cheap recently. I just can't get into it. Gearbox made so many improvements over BL1 when they made BL2. BL1 is almost unplayable in comparison.

EDIT: I started really playing this game and boy was my original impression wrong. While I stand by my statement that BL2 certain did improve on the systems over BL1, BL1 is great in it's own right."
8868,"shittiest ending ever

Don't spend too much money in this"
8869,Best game ever 10/10.........BUT IT WOULD BE EVEN BETTER IF I HAD FRIENDS WHO PLAYED IT...*sob
8870,"Lots of lands no borders not a ture border expericene but still has officers 6/10
"
8871,"I think I like it o:.

But my computer can't run it for that much time. Still I had a blast playing the online! :D"
8872,"Very fun and addictive FPS wit RPG elements, tons of weapons, different enemies, a lot of replayability."
8873,rip in peace game spy
8874,i been playing borderlands alot but it has it wacky ppl and i think this should be worked on some more more dlc more stuff more packs for weapons more more more......... but this is one kick ass games i got to play as all four ppl i love the siren the most all around rated m for mature fuck that rated a for awesome
8875,"Game is pretty cool especially in co-op. I like graphics style but physics is ""perfect"" Achieving levels is addictive. You want to be better and better i like those kind of games. 7/10"
8876,"This game has been labeled as an DIablo-style FPS, and I can't really think of a better way to describe it - it just says it all!
You start out choosing a class for your avatar, progress through story, earning XP, levels and climbing up the ability tree.
There are no saves to take into account, because a respawn system is in place, taking Your mind of that, and making sure that You just enjoy the game! You still need tactics and proper situation assessment, so it's not a ""forgive-all"" difficulty - You will still be punished for dying and enemies will respawn after time and regenerate lost hit health.

Each game has random loot, so no two games are exactly the same. It adds a nice touch and makes You think about how to (re-)distribute skill points for the current situation.

When starting out, just take Your time and if You ever feel frustrated, just do some research about some game mechanics/advanced settings. It's very well worth the time for this game :)

I do recommend this game wholeheartedly to anyone, not just the FPS loving crowd :)"
8877,"Let's talk about Co-op... 

For every game developer out there - this is how you co-op properly!! Seriously, Borderlands has to be, hands down, one of our best co-op experiences to date. While this game is a typical FPS style game, it is much more than that. The art is in a style all its own, which some love and some hate. I not great with words, but I'd describe it as ""gritty cartoon"". The story in this game is what makes it so special. 

Many games tote co-op and multiplayer modes, but often they lack in the story department. The character development is fun, and all of the characters really have a uniqueness to them in design and playstyle. For me this really increases the play value of the game. 

Pick it up, play it with friends and then play all of the other games in the franchise... and all of the DLCs, you'll be set for quite a while. 
"
8878,"If you don't like this game, then get out mah face."
8879,"The beginning of one of the best series! This game was, and is still epic! Funny to play and full of fantastic and charismatic characters! Years are passed but playing borderlands is always a pleasure!"
8880,"this game is a fucking grind but can get relatively fun if you play it with friends, especially more than 2 people
doesn't matter though got it for a dollar (:"
8881,"The one that started it all.  Excellent game with complex gun mechanics, simple RPG elements, and funny characters.  The world has a western feel to it and the enemies have a Road Warrior feel to them.  The DLCs are also good.  Not crazy about the arena one.  Borderlands 2 is even better, with more voice acting and funny stuff.   The guns are less gimicky in this game as opposed to borderlands 2.  However I can't simply can't stop playing Borderlands 2.  The pre-sequel is also good, but not great."
8882,highly recommend. RPG mixed with FPS! so many types of weapons to loot from
8883,"Game Play - 1  Play Time - 1
Engaging - 1  Stability - 1
Sound - 1  Innovation - 1
Story - 1  Replay - 1
Graphics - 1  Price - 1

Total Score - 10/10

The port can be a little rough on the cpu. I would suggest running it on a rig with the more than the reccommened system requirments. Other than that the game is amasing. So ... yeah .. buy it."
8884,love playing this game naked... sometimes i get erect... its nice
8885,This game might be old but it's pretty cheap and one of the must buys if are switching from consoles. Had this game on PS3 and it was the first game I actually bought on my PC !
8886,Loot loot loot
8887,I still like this game a fair bit.
8888,"If I could some up my love for this game in one sentence it would be: Hey, this game is pretty great"
8889,Gay shit butt ass.
8890,bad
8891,Did you ever want to play Diablo in FPS? This game gives you that with an infinte loot.
8892,It's so much fun killing everything in your way and  looting their corpses. I was actually suprised by the size of the open world in this game. A must buy!
8893,"It's been several years since Borderlands has been a well established game and franchise so it'll come as no surprise that this game is outstanding and I highly recommend it. The first entry to the series is by far my favourite (Borderlands 2 coming in as a really close second) and I'll tell you why.

The atmosphere of the first game is completely unique and unlike the future release it would go on to have. It's dark, it's gritty, the inhabitants are terrifyingly uncivilised and it makes for an memorable experience.

The voice acting is top notch, the characters are unique, witty, dark, scary and sometimes down right incompetent but unforgettable.

The art style is all hand drawn which are then tweaked and processed until you get what you see while you play. Needless to say the game's art style is its main attraction and it doesn't disappoint.

Lastly, the game offers 3 playthroughs per character, playthrough 1 on ""normal"", playthrough 2 commonly known as True Vault Hunter Mode and then plathrough 2.5 which will take you a solid 25 hours each (assuming you're just rushing through everything) and much more if you stop for all the quests and explore everything and really soak in the experience."
8894,"Just a quick note so you know where I'm coming from. I have played Borderlands (this game) plus the DLCs, as well as Borderlands 2. I have not played the pre-sequel thingy, so I have no opinion on that one.

Probably the more interesting of the Borderlands games in terms of theme, main quest, loot drops and classes. It also doesn't push any single NPC (like Claptrap) too much, which I like. It doesn't really have a lot of unnecessary BS, so you get to just enjoy the game for what it is.

There are some technical flaws, such as a rather lackluster graphics options menu and a default field-of-view that's narrow enough to make me feel like I'm playing with blinders on. Probably the only game I've ever played that came close to giving me a headache from the FOV alone. You can work around this by adding a line or two to one of the config files (see PCGamingWiki for details) and then pressing a button once every time you enter a game or enter/exit a vehicle to set the FOV to a much better value.

If you are willing to work around (or live with) the technical flaws, it is in my mind the best of the Borderlands games. The DLCs are pretty decent. One of them allows you to fight large mechs, which is cool. The swamp DLC is rather dull and repetitive unless you really enjoy zombies, but you might as well pick up the GOTY edition anyway."
8895,"Easily one of the most over-rated games I have ever played. A Fallout clone meets uninspired WoW RPG interface that lacks serious polish. I didn't mind the cell shading but question it's effectiveness in a post apocalyptic-like setting. Everything is just brown and bland including the enemies. 

The clunky and erratic aiming controls on the console make over-powered general mobs incredibly frustrating. Enemy AI seems to exploit these poor controls by straffing and sprinting all over while they posses near perfect aim. Axe wielding mobs are insanely ridiculous as they can heave axes from miles away with dead on accuracy (even over huge boulders or cover) all while you struggle with the aim of a sniper rifle. 

As an FPS this game is pretty weak compared to other offerings out there. Even with sensitivity turned way up the aim is always poor. Weapons have erratic aim. Some shots will land crits while other perfectly aimed shots miss or register next to no damage. Explosives can go off at enemy or even your own feet dealing little to no damage then a grenade 10 feet away can kill you or a mob. Weapons are also pretty bland with just different stats. 

Basically I never felt like I was progressing in this game. Most RPGs allow players to reach a point where they develop their stats enough to manipulate the game engine and make playthrough either easier or more enjoyable. Borderlands always has the player feeling like he is horribly underpowered and no amount of leveling really matters. It's all luck based on which weapons you find. The sotry is kind of vague and most quests are just random fetch quests or bounty missions. I never really had a full understanding of what I was doing. I gather the single player story is short but after 8 hours of just monotonous grinding I won't be finishing this title. There are way better games to play and the release of Borderlands 2 will not be seeing me as a customer. Even as a budget title I would give this a miss."
8896,1 of the best games but bl2 is a bit better
8897,yes
8898,"Found the Vault, shot multiple people in the face and blew up tons of Claptraps.

10/10, would destroy Claptrap again."
8899,no Russian language
8900,"This was on my games to play list.

Finally got around to it, really fun game to play, excellent FPS, can pick up and play and be content.

Mechanics are amazing can't wait to finish it and get on to the next 2.

9/10"
8901,Nostalgia :)
8902,Killed Bandits Dead. Killed Skags Dead. Played as a bounty Hunter. Used a shotgun and walked up to blow their heads off.  Didn't kill Claptrap....
8903,"Great game just lacking settings like Vsync and a FOV slider but can be adjusted within the settings, guides can be found on steam luckily, still a great game, (please excuse my play time, have about 100 hours on the 360 version)"
8904,"Played this game fully (DLC and all) with my sister on her xbox years ago, and I never forgot the experience. Decided to go grab GOTY on steam when it went on sale to relive the memories, and my feelings have not changed. The game is as fun as it was back then, and has not lost its quirky charm. Claptrap's like the navi of this game though...my only complaint.
P.S. Mordecai's such a psycho when he kills things.

10/10 would laugh maniacally at death again"
8905,"Almost 33 hours and I am just now reaching level 55, and I was doing nothing but mainly the storyline, perhaps once in a while a side quest here and there.
10/10, would take all day to level up to max. (love it)"
8906,"good fps game
the random drops is a nice mechanic but it also can be extreme easy or hard if you have a lot of luck or bad luck because of this.
the game is big and there is a lot of exploration"
8907,"Almost as great as its sequel, but dozen hours of just desert can be a problem."
8908,An RPG with FPS mechanics and procedurally generated weapons. What's not to like?
8909,Great game with an amazing story line and hours of gameplay.  Co-Op is pretty good too!
8910,"This is the first time I played this game and it has passed the test of time quite well. The gameplay is rather simplistic and the story straightforward but in small doses the game is really fun. Simply blasting your enemies is satisfying and the space fallout atmosphere provides a nice climatic background. I do not care much for the comic book graphics but they do fit well with the setting. That said, it is obviously not on the level of current games, paper like models, clipping, low res textures and the like are to be expected. All in all, if you're looking for the fun of shooting sci-fi guns and Mass Effect is too much thinking or you need an alternative to the new Fallout games, this is still a good choice."
8911,Would smash Moxxi 10/10
8912,"I've played easily over a thousand hours of this when it was on console and after i moved to pc gaming i had to get this (of course with all dlc) all guns in this are great,they all feel good all the time. the game will grow on you and you'll never have the ""best loadout"" ever because there will always be a better gun. even after playing so much on console i still found myself finding better guns, i miss the revolvers and shotguns from this because imo they messed it up in the 2nd one but this game is a gem, dont pass it up. BUY IT ALL."
8913,"I played this on the old xbox with my brother when it came out. So many fond memories of shooting him in the back... so I decided, why not on steam? Now I can actually pay attention to the story, plus it's a good warm up for Borderlands 2. If you don't really care about the lore though just go with the sequel, it's a bit more interesting story/game wise."
8914,"Fascinating start to an incredibly fun series. Highly reccomend the first borderlands, especially playing with a friend. Not much to say other than ""o', the adventures you'll get into"". 9.5/10."
8915,"This game was really good. It had an intense storyline, a wide variety of guns, a great deal of comedic dialogue and well it is by far the best fps game i've ever played. Thanks gearbox for making this game the way you did."
8916,"role-playing shooter, 4 player co-op, 87 bazillion guns, do I need to tell you anything more? Buy it"
8917,"I had Borderlands 2 and been toying the thought of getting this game until I seen it on the Humble Bundle Pack. I have been playing this almost non-stop and love the co-op options that the game offers. Great game to get with all the add-ons I love the game, love it. The graphic in game remind me of a graphics novel style of game play alomst like the graphhics style of The Darkness 2. This is such a different and unexpected gem."
8918,"Sin duda un juego que me ha sorprendido mucho, no pensé que fuese tan divertido, algo que al principio me causaba dudas, ahora me encanta y es el tema de los bordes, por otro lado puedo decir que el juego es sumamente extenso, hay demasiados sitios a donde ir, los diferentes ambientes me han encantado, su musica esta muy genial, sin embargo creo que deberian mejorar el menu, me parece muy simple y es molesto no poder editar todas las configuraciones que queramos por el menu, sino que debemos ir al archivo de configuración, la historia es un poco extraña pero de resto recomiendo este juego, la verdad a pesar de estas contras, pienso que es un excelente juego, uno de esos que no deberia faltar en la biblioteca. Recomendado al %101."
8919,Great game. Playing through multiple times with different classes is just as fun.
8920,"The borderlands game I prefer the most.  Mainly due to the fact that there's no insane level scaling allowing players to have a smoother time leveling up.  The diffeculty curve is more consistent with less exponential number increases, both giving and taking with more focus on enemy strategies.  The mad max styled atmosphere providing a more hostile and unwelcome wasteland with better tension thoughout the world.  The music is more fitting to the style and helps ramp up the sense of danger during firefights.  The guns are actually more varied despite the lesser amount of parts and the weapon proficiency system means that a weapon from the early levels can still be useful much later and there are more gun manufactures and classes with less restrictions on each one (seriously where is S&S munitions in BL2?).  The largely non-existent plot also lets players largely go at their own pace without forcing anyone to rush, while the bounty boards are actually useful and not worthless decorations.  The humor is less in your face and pretentious compared to BL2.  Finally the overall menu interface is simple with a prefrence for function over style. 

Negatives:  The vehicle health is lower than it should be causing them to be less useful than nessecary.  Should be higher but not as high as borderlands 2 has it.  The weapon proficiency system can cause inadverdent heavy bias to certain weapon classes and should be modified but NOT removed.   The low amount of graphics customization compared to the second game.   Less variety of creatures to fight against than the second."
8921,Great Game with DLC for bonus in Prequal
8922,"Good, story is a little strange."
8923,"Boring, repeitive, and little replay value.  Endless amounts of time comparing weapon abilities and looking at crap on the ground.  Limited voice acting, boring cutscenes.  The only thing I liked about it was Claptrap, and he was annoying as ever.  8-14 year olds will probably disagree."
8924,Funny!
8925,I like borderlands games but not the first one because it wont let me download and play the game. Then again I would recremend the game to other player aside from that glitch.
8926,"Borderland is a fair game, it's not bad tho i whould not say that it's the best game ever.
The story is fair and so is the gameplay.
You'll have a real blast if you play online or with friends (playing solo can get pretty boring).
The dlc are legit btw.

7,7- to many guns


"
8927,"Would have given the game a postivie review if the developers hadn't put Mothrakk into it. Inrcedibly overpowered boss that is literally, and I mean literally, impossible to kill in single player. Fucking retarded. Don't buy this piece of trash."
8928,Classic FPS Loot fest
8929,Dlc is a little repetitive but main story line is compelling enough. Great looter and shooter. ( this is my 2nd time playing through...don't think I appreciated it enough the 1st time).
8930,DINGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8931,"Borderlands...the marriage of FPS and RPG. But does it work? Let's find out!

The Good:
------------
1. [b] Excellent art style[/b] - Borderlands looks great and plays silky smooth. Using cel-shaded graphics, Borderlands has a unique and alien vibe about it, displaying the world of Pandora in lush and vivid detail. Although many may feel that this look is somewhat cartoony and basic, I love the art style for the game and felt totally engrossed by it.
2. [b] High Replayability[/b] - The player can choose from 4 different pre-made characters, with each one having a unique skill tree to develop. The soldier, for example, gets a machine gun turret, that can be upgraded and made more powerful. Add in the fact that the game has a massively randomized loot engine (more on that soon) and the ability to keep levelling your character once the game has ended makes Borderlands almost seem like an offline MMO at times.
3. [b] Fun and addictive gameplay[/b] - Borderlands is simply fun to play, albeit mindless fun. Getting in a vehicle and driving around Pandora, plowing over bandits as your drive, is immensely satisfying. I often found myself wanting to see what was in the next ""zone"", and trying to face it's challenges.

The Bad :
-----------
1. [b]Very weak story[/b] - If you value a deep and immersive story, look elsewhere. The gist of the game is that you are dropped off on the planet of Pandora and using the telepathic image of a woman, you seek out the fabled ""Vault"", a legendary place of untold riches. There is a main quest, but the game basically is a bunch of ""fetch this, kill that"" mini-quests to grow more powerful to fight the final battle. There are bosses, but they are devoid of character and seem to serve no purpose other that saying ""hey! We got bosses in our game!"" The game feels very weak in the story department.
2. [b]Online is a mess [/b]- If you value your games having a strong multi-player feature, Borderlands falls flat. Servers are rarely up, and when they are you will find chat options a pain. There isn't a very good view of messages recieved by other players, and the game offers no microphone support.
3. [b] Not optimized for PC [/b] - This isn't a major point for me, but I know a LOT of people get salty when there aren't a lot of graphical options and PC-centric options. Borderlands feels a lot like a console game at times which is okay, but I really would have liked the menus and UI to be more PC friendly.

Overall Rating:
-----------------
  
  Borderlands is definitely worth at least one play through, especially if you are a fan of shooters and RPGS. While Borderlands doesn't do either one perfectly, it does enough to give the player a pretty enjoyable experience.

  [b] 6/10 [/b] - GOOD"
8932,Still one of my favorite all time games
8933,"thisgame has some solid shooting , a not so good story , but the lack of nnot being able to change your fov did not sel it for me , i dont recommend it to anyone who is fov sensitive like me i cant play this game without getting a headache"
8934,"So ive played this quite a bit now and one thing stands out, its easy ive played it through a few times and the only time that i have died is when i stupidly run out into the middle of combat to save my girlfrend from dieing (lets face it i kinda have to) all in all its a nice fun game to take your mind off things providing you dont get annoid easy from the running back and forth, co-op is better and more fun but then it always is in my opinion, it is a very good game well worth getting and for the GOTY edition with all the DLC not a bad price to be fair, espesaly if you can get it while its on sale."
8935,"Flock of Rakk flew into my stationary vehicle's tires and exploded 10/10.




On a more serious note, I haven't beaten the entire game, DLC and all, but I killed the [spoiler] Destroyer [/spoiler], and I think that that's close enough to write a  complete review. I'm going to name a bunch of small things, then summarize my overall thoughts.

The early-game SG43 Fatal Death Shotgun is amazing (accuracy 74.6), and I used it throughout the entire game, where it continued to be incredibly useful.

This game would be hard if not for Second Winds. A lot of bosses have a lot of little guys helping them, and that's their downfall.

Patricia Tannis' story is intriguing, and I wanted to see all of it.

I respect Bandit Raiders. There, I said it. They joined a mercenary organization, and what do they do? They bring a big, menacing, puffy coat, a shield, and a GUN. And they take lots of cover and fire only from the shoulder.

Overall, the combat can sometimes be annoying, especially near the end, but the story is good and the RPG mechanics work well. And the style and attitude are unmatched. Get it.

EDIT: After doing all the DLC, I have to admit that the SG43 Fatal Death does get outdated soon enough. Ah, well. I still remain a loyal customer of S&S's Death line."
8936,Best FPS I have played in a long while.
8937,i game shared with a friend and i want to play more
8938,"great and often dirt cheap with sales, fun with friends as well. has a much more interesting story than borerlands 2 in my opinion."
8939,My fists made someone's head explode. 10/10
8940,"Wow, what a good game. I haven't played since 2011 and I am enjoying it even more in 2015. Unfortunately there are some people with the misconception that the sequels are better games. These people should visit a proctologist to have their head removed from their ass (thx 4 dank joke buck'le). If i see another motherfucker talkin shit about borderlands i will throw hands so hard like paralyze a nigga to where he in a chair like that smart dude steven spielburg who does all that space stuff. I wouldn't reccommend playing if you're a midget because you may be offended by the number of midgets you have to kill (they're so cute like little lawn gnomes). You can play as generic black guy, generic meat head, sexy lady with magic witchcraft, or a robber with a bird. This game is an absolute experience which faggot casulz can have fun with and the hardcore can stay. I'd even go as far as to say this game is above average, it has a redneck with a hot mom, how cool. At the end you fight a toothed vagina so that's cool. unfortunately my brain has been addled by the marijuaynee and i can no longer play video games as it gave me 8th degree arthritis."
8941,"Appreciate you having a poke at that. Uhh... That thing not my mom, hotdog down a skag den y'know what I'm saying?

11/3 wuld bang"
8942,"Better gameplay and more rewarding than Borderlands 2. If the ruleset and gameplay was ported to the Borderlands 2 engine, this game would be amazing."
8943,Greatest game series ever. 100/100 would (and do) play again and again.
8944,"An enjoyable game. I decided to play it solo instead of co-op so I could enjoy story and cut scenes without having friends talking and goofing around in-between. Not too sure if it was a good idea seeing as it made the game a lot more challenging. Especially playing as a hunter/sniper class with only 3 rounds per segment while literally everything agro'd you at once made this game a huge challenge. Quests that were rated as lv 15 actually meant you should be lv 18 or higher before you could finish it solo with ease. In other words, after realising you need to take some time off to go side quest/grind before becoming strong enough, the game becomes quite enjoyable. The art style still seems relevant today and does not look dated at all. Runs great on my laptop maxed out 1080p with no hitches at a full 60fps. I did however encounter really really bad screen tearing as my GPU rendered more frames than the refresh rate of my screen. There is NO v-sync option in the menus and that was a shame. To counter this, I found the game's ini file and manually altered a line of code to force the engine to enable v-sync. Apart from that, no complaints.

Got it for $1 as part of a humble bundle. Totally worth it. ^^

8/10. Fun, not perfect, a really different take on an FPS RPG that felt like a good amount of time and effort went into developing it.

Note: I also purchased Borderlands 2 as part of the bundle. Im told its the better more polished game. Looking forward to trying it soon."
8945,Claptrap for the president!
8946,epic
8947,"Sadly I cant really review it because of my f**king potato (my pc) but.....this game is just 10/10...cant say any more,just that its excellent,recommended for all FPS fans,and yes,I know there is borderlands 2,but my potato cant handle it,but I really love this game. (P.S: I got this game from a friend called ›ᎡᎪᎷᏐᎡᎤ‹, hes a very nice guy) anyawys,cant say enough about this. So on to the real review. Graphics: 9/10. They are ok for a game made like 6 years ago. Singleplayer: 10/10. I love the singleplayer story. Multiplayer: ?/10. I havent tried out the multiplayer yet,so I dont know much about it. Overall: 9/10. I would give a 10/10 but it just dosent have the right graphics. But anyways YOU MUST TRY Borderlands out,if you want get the other Borderlands. (Borderlands 2,ect.) Anyways. Great Game, Highly Recommended."

8965,"8/10

If you haven't played this game by now you're like me; There are prior elements of many games here as well as elements that many future games have been built upon. The gameplay partially reminded me of a similar ""low-gravity, shielded action FPS on another world"" shooter called Halo. Did I say Halo?, I meant Halo 4 (10/10). 

As a Vault Hunter on open world Pandora, you need to favour your way through the right people and fight your way to your destiny. Collect more powerful weapons and sell your loot for cash. Spend your cash on upgrades and better weapons, or save it for when you die and need reconstruction."
8966,"Simple gameplay, decent storyline, large number of guns & maps with a nice atmosphere, a little touch of humour, nice soundtrack, good replayability, fun to play alone -- twice as fun to play with friends.

Very few bad touches here and there (A little bit of Puke inducing FOV, a little bit of glitchy physics, a not-so-helpful fast-travel system) nothing THAT big.

Your Grandma's PC can run it.

8,5/10 overall, 9/10 with friends ""would ramp over Pis Wash Gully again"""
8967,"One of my favourite games EVER. Perfect atmosphere, interesting graphics, simple yet entertaining mechanics."
8968,"A great FPS/RPG game. I recommend playing it Co-op, the experience is a lot better than single."
8969,"Borderlands is the cult classic loot shooter, where the main goal is to kill stuff and collect guns and guns and even more guns.

Borderlands takes place on a planet of Pandora where danger lurks around every corner, we play as the vault hunters who came to Pandora seeking a vault, a place that contains fortunes. You can pick from four different characters Brick, Roland, Lilith and Mordecai 

The game is an RPG infused FPS. You run around killing stuff and looting chest for better equipment. The game is very fun and getting better equipment is also incredibly fun. The four characters you choose from have different abilities. Brick has berserk mode where he punches stuff and in rage mode regains health, Mordecai releases his pet Bloodwing which is a one hit kill on a random enemy in the battlefield or damages bosses, Roland puts down a turret which kills anything it sees and Lilith goes into phaselock mode where she goes invisible and after that releases a shockwave which kills or damages anyone around them. Each character is awesome but it's best to use the one to suit your play style the best.

Graphics are awesome. The cell shaded look is awesome and even though some of the textures are mediocre this game is very appealing. The environments are very bland since all of them are deserts. I'm still very glad that the change from realistic to cell shaded happened.

Audio is mediocre, I like some of the soundtrack but overall it's very bland. The gun sounds are awesome and everything but a lot of it is re used and some of the sound effects are quite bad.  Overall very mediocre sound design 

The game can get quite tough at certain points, some of the enemies are higher levels than you and will kill you in seconds. Your best option is to do every side quest to level so the later sections in the game aren't as tough.

Level design is alright for the most part but some of the maps in the later sections of the game get really confusing. Overall it's okay for the most part.

The main game itself took me 18 hours to complete everything with every side quest, with all the dlc it took me around 30 hours. The game also has tons of replay value, you can play Ultimate Vault Hunter and True Hunter which are more difficult versions of the game and you can also try the different characters and not to mention you can always play the game with friends which is a lot of fun.

The game has one big problem. It's incredibly buggy. I've had many problems playing the game and DLC and constantly look for solutions to the problems I was having. Some of the issues were quests not showing up, I couldn't turn in quests. get stuck in the environments and fall through the levels. Overall there's nothing too game breaking and with enough time you could find a fix for the problems.

Borderlands is a must play for everyone. To date this is one of my favorite games of all time. This game is incredibly fun and funny too. This is incredibly fun game and even despite the issues this is a must play for everyone. My suggestion is get the main game and skip the DLC's cause they're not very good but if you want more then sure go ahead and buy it but I suggest saving your money for Borderlands 2. This is a must play for everyone. I give Borderlands a 9/10

8970,"I normally stay away from multiplayer focuseed games. Mostly because my net can be sucktastic. However this game, my just sell me on the whole 4-player co-op multiplayer. It's a good game. Frustrating, Fun, Challenging, Grindy and  actually enjoyable.

The Good

The game's open environment sets up wonderful little moments trhough out. Like jet boosting your runner off a ramp and landing CRASH into a bandit runner knocking it over and gunning down the occupants as they pul themselves from the wrecakage.


Challenging. While tem,pting to over level it's rather rewarding to tackle and complete missions that are a little above you.


The BAd

Not a litr of variety in the classes..

The RNG will make uyou hate RNG's. It creates a bit of a disjoint when you line an enemy perfectly in your sights and then miss only because the rng said you should miss."
8971,"Great game from last generation, but the pc version has some performance issues. There are noticable framerate drops in some areas which is a shame. Also the menus are pretty bad if you're using a mouse and keyboard. I shouldn;t have to use pgup/pgdn to scroll though a mission description when I have a scroll wheel on my mouse. It's an old game with a few sequels so there won't be an update, but I'm going to recommend it anyway because it's still a very fun game."
8972,"Absolute gold. A great and unique shooter that still looks fantastic. The writing and gameplay of this game is outstanding, and the developers have done a great job of improving and further making the next games in the franchise unique and even more story-driven. In modern gaming the dlc is suprisingly absolutely worth it. Give all of your money to gearbox now and play these amazing games."
8973,"Love everything about this game !
-Weapons
-Characters
-Map
-Cars
-Missions
-DLCS *The zombie one is the best !*
You should try it ! It's funny and one of the best FPS"
8974,"When you look at all these good reviews and think is this game really as good as everyone says it is, i can honestly assure you this is one of the greatest if not the greatest FPS RPG games i have ever played. Amazing gameplay overpowers the old graphics of the game and its great to play with friends also. 10/10 would recommend."
8975,"I wasn't really into FPS games until I found Borerlands. This game, along with the 2 others, are amazing. There needs to be a new word invented for how fantastic this and all the other games are. It's fun and challenging, the story line is wonderful, the humor really fits my own and I love every bit of it. I have no complaints at all and I hope they keep making more Borderlands games."
8976,"A super creative game, tons of weapons to find, great story and awesome gameplay. 
What would you want more?"
8977,"I love Borderlands. It offers so much, and has a kick ass story."
8978,"There must be a guy who eats ammo, because you can find it in the toilets.

8979,"I wish you could decrease the head-bob in this installment.  Other than that, this game is well made! Has co-op for even more fun!  Also has good humour to it!

Immense fun with friends.

8984,"Boom Boom Boppity Bop!
Buy This Game, Now. Now! NOW!"
8985,"I just don't understand why people like this game, it should've been called Boringlands.

- Flat story that doesn't deepen or goes anywhere in the end.
- Flat enemies with terrible AI.
- Flat weapons that are all the same just with different stats and damage types with only a few real exceptions.
- Flat sound: Everytime I run over an enemy, all I hear is someone squashing a tomato in his hand. Gun sounds are equally poor.
- Flat NPC's: No personality, they only give boring fetch quests in poorly written humor. The least they could've done is used voice over this day and age.
- Flat and dissapointing bossfights that are poorly designed and pose no legit challenge.
- Terrible driving controls and mechanics, it works but is not enjoyable.

This game is boring and paperthin in every aspect 5/10"
8986,the review should be overwhelming positive !
8987,It is an amazing game
8988,"An excellent game, especially for its time. Although I will say it is the weakest of the Borderlands Series that's not saying much, with the game fulfilling on its promise of a plethora of loot and fantastic game mechanics. I would disagree with the majority and say that I like the ending. I won't give it away but I shall just say that sometimes the Journey is greater than the destination. Additionally, the First Borderlands game was never sold as a fantastic story but as a loot hoarding game filled with explosions and i'd suggest taken on board as such. Futher equipped with a fantastic soundtrack and incredible DLC this game is a fantastic standalone game or an even better launch pad to begin your Borderlands Series addiction"
8989,Shooting zombies for brains 10/10
8990,Always run out of ammo. 10/10
8991,"There's not much to say, this game is an old but amazing. The start of something badass!"
8992,"One of my all time favourite game.  A few years old, but visuals are still stunning, and gameplay, although repetitive and sometimes redundant (e.g. Finding hidden recordings in different maps),  it is still addicting.  Storyline is not to shabby as well.  I recommend getting Knoxx and Moxxi Underdome DLC, but not the other two (Claptrap and Dr neds whatever).  With Knoxx, you get even more enemies to fight, together with a lootable armory and an extremely hard boss (Craw).  The feeling you get when you find a Pearl"
8993,"""If it took more than one shot you weren't using a Jakobs."" -Marcus Kincaid

Amazing game:
you get loot
you kill people
you get more loot
kill more people
and repeat"
8994,"Got it along with 3 DLC's from the Humble Bundle for $1...

10/10"
8995,"This has been one of my favorite games since I first got it when I was 9 years old,at least I think that's how old I was. I love the cartoony graphics and bat-shit insane guns you can get later on in the game. The bosses are hard but they give out some badass rewards. Speaking of badasses,try and avoid those bastards. They'll turn your butt inside out. I recommend Mordecai as a starter character. He uses the sniper rifle and a pistol. It's up to you who you choose,though. Each character has their own unique ability and advantage with different weapon types. As you use weapons,you gain XP in that weapon category. Each level in that weapon category gives you awesome bonuses. Speaking of bonuses,leveling up gives you a skill point. Which you can then use to spend on any skill you see that you like. Each one dramatically effects the way your character plays. Whether it be increased accuracy,or a longer duration for your character's special skill. The online is amazing. Playing with friends,brutally murdering bandits and skags. Wonderful times to be had on Pandora! As you can see,I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a big fan of FPS and action games."
8996,"Wracked with technical foibles and poorly rendered mechanics which deliver this game as inoperable at worst and disposably mundane at best, with zero of the shorthanded yet witty charm of its successors.

TLDR: Thinking of playing Borderlands? Play Borderlands 2 or the Pre-Sequel instead.

At the very least, these sequels can be considered fun, competent shooters that actually work as intended. A tenuous statement if made about this forerunner title."
8997,"The first game in the prominent series, Borderlands Game of The Year does a good job of scratching that particular itch only a RPG-Shooter could. Playing this game after finishing the others was good I think; I enjoyed a few little things in this game: like how the sniper gun works, but the revisions of BL2 have made this game a bit more annoying to play. Gameplay begins to feel like a chore with repetive missions and a slogging areas. The gunplay is solid, but I would only pick this one up if you have exhaused the other games in this series. I would still recommend BL because I enjoyed my time, but the DLC proved to me that it was time to move on. My itch was scratched until the next game in the series is announced."
8998,"I wasn't exactly sure to recommend this game or not. A lot can be said about Borderlands. It's a pretty decent game. I don't recommend this to a person who is just now starting the series. Borderlands 2 is the best in the series for beginners. Borderlands 2 succeeded Borderlands in absolutely every way. All of the problems featured in this list are completely fixed by Borderlands 2. So, Borderlands 2 is the best way to go if you want to start the series on the right foot. 

Borderlands is kind of an old game now. It's been six years since its release. Which leads me to my complaints. There is a lot wrong with Borderlands. Its menu is designed for a console game, there are little to no options for graphics and controls. The game forces you to use ""toggle"" crouch and ""hold"" aiming. It's a console game stretched out for PC with no regard for the players that prefer a more sophisticated mouse and keyboard. Constand screen tearing makes my game look like they're spraying my windshield with water at the end of a car wash and I'm watching the soap go up or down in lines. Even when I enable vertical sync (which by the way is not actually in the game's options. You have to go into the .ini files and change that yourself) I still had horrible screen tearing. Most of the graphics options that come standard in every modern PC game are not even there in the game. You have to fix that yourself in the .ini files. If you feel like cranking the graphics up you have to change that in the .ini files as well. Soeaking of these files, the only thing that appears to be out of my control are the controls. Even in the .ini files I am unable to find the option to set controls to ""toggle"" and ""hold"". If you are not tech savvy or if you are new to Borderlands, I do not recommend this game. But for those that are up for the challenge, it's pretty rewarding in the end. As I said earlier, if you or a loved one are looking to get into Borderlands for PC, get Borderlands 2. You can get the Game Of The Year edition and enjoy yourself for over 40 hours of main story plus and extra 40+ hours of DLC."
8999,"BORDERLANDS 

   BORDERLANDS is a good game though i know it's old but it's still got a lot of fun still in the game.

   I think that this game(BORDERLANDS) was a very well produced game. BORDERLANDS is fun, coopertive, and has a very good story line and now since there is now about three more that have came out the others will be a lot of fun or even funner since they are better optimized and the newest 
one(BORDERLANDS PRESEQUAL) will most likely have the newest and best side quest and other fun things to do

 BORDERLANDS was optimized not poorly but also not that good as you would think it would be. The graphics of the terrain, cars, and building's are very poorly done BUT... BORDERLANDS is still a good game

  i hope you give this commet a thumbs up and hope you have fun and write a good review for this awsome game that needed it"

9008,one of the best games ever made
9009,"A game that is best played with your friends.
FPS with RPG elements like level and skills tree.

It maybe old for now since this came on 2009 but still GOLD!

9010,"Borderlands is one of the most enteratining experiances you can have while gaming.

The Good:
-Hilarious Dialouge
-Tons of different loot
-A bunch of side quests and DLC 
-Great shooter mechanics
-4 distinct classes with multiple ways to build each one
-Drop in drop out co-op for up to 4 players

The Bad
-Lighthearted gameplay? (If you're looking for epic serious story, this is not it)

Trust me, if you haven't yet played the game and you like shooters, go for it."
9011,"It's very satisfying to shoot a half naked psycho on his crotch and set them on fire with a sniper rifle.

I've been playing him on PS3 finished him so many times, Humble Bundle did a great job and help me to buy all the series togather.
So many weapons to choose. uniqe graphics, The Most BADASS game ever!
Worth buying!"
9015,"This is and will always be one of my favorite games, I have lost days to this game. I have lost nights to this game. I have lost years to this game, but I cannot say that I would take it back if i could. Great game and a great buy."

9019,Come and shoot. Take loot. Ride a midget like mario.
9020,"Borderlands is amazing and one of the best games Ive ever played. What Borderlands does that very few other games do, is focus on COOP. The whole game is designed with coop in mind. If you havent played some Borderlands 1 or 2 with a close friend or partner, you are missing out on some great gaming. 
Borderlands scratches the same itch as Diablo 2 but in a first person shooter. The characters are fun and the story keeps you going. 
Borderlands 1 suffers from a lack of variation in environments. 
Great game in coop. Its ok solo but no where near the same. People say ""oh all games are better with friends"" but that misses the point. Borderlands is coop gold."
9021,"GUN FARMING SIMULATOR

Played the heck out of this game back when it was released. I found it tad difficult to get used to again after playing BL2 so much, but I must admit it's still quite good.

If you're looking for a ""complete"" Borderlands experience, I'd recommend going for the second game (GOTY edition is good). First Borderlands felt like a beta for Gearbox to test new grounds, before they fixed everything and released BL2.

I found Pre-Sequel disappointing as it was pretty much the same BL again for a full price and another crapton of DLC... also the writing was weaker than in BL2.

I'd recommend getting BL if you can catch it on sale sometimes/somewhere f you've already played the newer games. It's fun for what it is. For newcomers to the franchise, go for BL2."
9022,buying this game is like sucking your own dick ~ hard but worth it
9023,"This game is so cool man. You get to play as a hunter, a siren, a soldier, and the man himself"
9024,"A very fun and amusing game with a strange/unique art style.  It seemd to reference Mad Max quite a bit, but I would say that it has a somewhat Monty Python humor to it.  9/10 if you like shooters/rpgs.  10/10 if you think they should also be funny"

After beating the game:
The story sucks.
The ending sucks.
The final boss didn't do anything but stand there and get shot.
We sprinted through the last map to rush it."
9029,"Out of all the FPS's I play, this is by far my favorite. It's catchy, easy to understand, witty, and of course, very fun. Later levels see a ramp in difficulty that creates a challenge that may warrant some mild language even from the heartiest of gamers, but in the end, it's still a rather enjoyable game."
9030,this is awesome!
9031,Loads of fun.
9032,"This game is collecting loot game, first you collect loot, then you sell loot, then you collect more loot and so on.
And you kill enemies because you want better loot."
9033,Right. last week i purchased Borderlands. i have played both borderlands 2 and borderlands the pre sequelbut neither of them have come close to the fun that i have had on this game. i highly reccomend this.
9034,Perfect game!
9035,10 out of 10 Game Series material!!!!!!!!!!
9036,Borderlands is a good game!
9037,The original Borderlands and the sequel (plus 75% off the pre-sequel) plus all the DLC for $15? Hell freaking yeah! Let's get me some loots!
9038,Great game with plenty of fun gameplay. Dialogue is witty and keeps the game fresh.
9039,"I played with He-Man during my last time in Borderlands. 
He mains Mordecai.
Of course, he would."
9040,GG
9041,Amazing. A couple hours in and I'm already hooked
9042,"Obligated to tweaks .ini files to make the game a minimum playable.
Boring and very long cutscenes impossible to pass.
Weapons feels like toys.
Extend the game playtime by adding a LOT of boring walks between different areas.
Ergonomy down in the abyss.
Toggle for crouch but not for aim ?
Iron sight is horrible.
The run key is buggy and frustrating.
Slow, sluggish, for running and jumping for example.
Invisible walls REALLY frustrating.
The AI is awful."
9043,yus
9044,I like this game
9045,"Borderlands was one of the first games I ever played, and coming back to it today, I still love the damn thing to bits.

I got this game a couple of years ago via a USB that was circulating around the classroom at school, and instantly fell in love with those trademark, cartoony-realistic graphics the game is famous for. Having beaten the game on that presumably illegally downloaded copy, I jumped at the chance to buy it on sale (Humble Bundle is OP :D), hence my low playtime.

This game has so much to offer the player, whether you be an experienced FPS player or an absolute n00b like I was on my first playthrough. This accessibility is primarily due to the RPG-like experience point system, that allowed me to level up and eventually defeat bosses despite my lack of skill.

The story in this game is above and beyond what you would expect from your average FPS game. I guess you can't really consider Borderlands a shooter more than it is an RPG, and this is one of the things that is so attractive about it. I would say that the game excels in many areas where other RPG's do not, namely the openess of the world and the fairly sizeable ammount of free choice you have when completing quests (I'm looking at you, Far Cry 3). The humor in the game is also brilliantly executed, and had me cracking up at many points throughout the story.

So is the game worth your hard earned money, even if it was realeased almost 6 years ago?

HELL YES."
9046,Its AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9047,Loads of Loot and Fun!
9048,"This game is so much fun!!! I should have gotten this years ago! Almost 20 hours in and I`m probably only half way through!   PS: Thank you Humble Bundle!
"
9049,Awesome game fun for everyone weather you like RPG games or FPS games. Good level of customization for skills and tons of weapons. Lots of gameplay between main story quests and side quests. I highly recomend this game if you find it appealing
9050,This game is a rip off of Borderlands the Pre-Sequel. 10/10 IGN
9051,This is the only good game
9052,10/10
9053,The wankest game galactic.
9054,Great game
9055,"I don't even know why so many people like this game. As far as this review goes, I will give you my honest opinion on Singleplayer.

Starting off with graphics. It looks alright. Looks more ""comic'y"".
When it comes to gun fight, - Jesus! It takes years to kill. Aim and weapon damage is so bad - Holy crap! Enemies are also bad at shooting, so I just would say that it sucks.

When it comes to missions, - Uh, they're stupid. Example: Go half mile away, kill monsters and bandits with bad aim, take some single item, bring it back to the doctor - Repeat.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game. I got it from Humble for 1$, so I guess it's ok. Dollar isn't that much. Besides this, nah, don't bother."
9056,"This review is long overdue. This game is very close to me because it is the first game I lost my soul in. I remember seeing trailers of this game and thinking how weird it looked and how it wasn't for me. I ended up buying it just for the lols, and I played it and instantly became addicted. I remember waiting impatiently for the dlc to come out and I just couldn't wait any longer. I beat the game so many times I memorized everything about the game. I absolutely love this game and think you will too! It is better than the second and is very fun! This is a must have for any gamer!"
9057,Extremely solid. Runs on basically any setup because of its unique way of graphics handling. Gameplay is comparable to its sequel and it isn't too behind on basically any other stats. Would recommend if u like grinding and shooters. For me it's 7/10
9058,great game.. if you like this youll go nuts for part 2
9059,"I don't see why people like it, enemies are all the same, guns don't have interesting things (like it gets more accurate when you shoot from borderlands 2 hyperion guns) although lilith is fun, she's too OP"
9060,really good game!
9061,"Borderlands retains the best elements of Fallout 3, leveling, skills, open RPG environment, and the first person shooter behavior and ridiculous weapons variety of Modern Warfare, all wrapped up in an orignal and creative style. The opportunities for developing a unique character based on the choices you make in the game are nearly infinite. 
No story to speak of, but the action is awesome and the variation of guns is stagering, Each kill or chest holds the hope of a better gun or artifact. The multiplayer is also great finishing a quest in your friends game completes it in yours as well. The car is nothing special just a good way to get around so don't expect any great vehicular battles but as I said the solo or team combat is just too good to miss. I recommend choosing the soldier if you are unsure tossing out a turret to distract and pick off enemies while you finish off the rest is great. 

I love this game, a must buy!

10/10"
9062,"Amazing game. I love the art styling of the game, and the gameplay is fantastic! But most of all I love the unblievable range of weapons."
9063,"It's a damned good shooter, solid and true to the ages.

This is one that'll be played for years and years."

9066,Welcome to Skag Gully! Where Skags eat everything but poop out ammo and guns! ^_^
9067,"Played this game after playing Borderlands 2 so everything I say will be kinda biased and compared to its epic successor. Of course this game isn't as good as its sequel, especially story-wise. But this is an addictive game nonetheless. 

Getting rare and red-text weapons, I felt, were much easier in Borderlands than in Borderlands 2 and also I felt this one was shorter(not that I'm complaining :P ). I probably shouldn't have had very high expectations from this one, but I won't say it was disappointing per se. The missions, the weaponry, levelling up et al felt familiar and the game as a whole was hella enjoyable.

But, if you're new to the Borderlands franchise, I suggest start with the sequel, and then eventually get this game to see where it all started. :P

8/10."
9068,"This is a fantastic game, if you can see past the terrible port to PC, the FOV is horrendous and even with a fix still manages to be terrible....Get ready for headaches."
9069,nice
9070,WOW 10/10
9071,"If I played this when it first came out I probably would have enjoyed it more, I feel in love with #2 and wanted to get the full back story by playing one. If you can't stand bad graphics I do no reccomend this one. But if you are a fan of the Borderlands series get it worth the play through."
9072,"The most difficult part of the game is deciding which gun you must sell or give up. 

Would decide agian

9073,yup
9074,Fun to play with friends!
9075,"Borderlands is a lot of fun. Slaying enemies with completely unique guns, leveling up, and then killing harder enemies with even better guns is so rewarding!"
9076,"might of been released in 2009 but it still out shines most so called fps games i love it, completed it on 2 platforms an i can easily recomend it."
9077,Wtf is this game?
9078,"6.7 hours on my first session? Playing this with a friend and, so long as you have one that takes it as seriously, or as silly, as you, then you're gonna have a great time. A funny little game with a funny little robot. Selling my PS3 copy after buying this on Humble Bundle. I'm a console player, but this is terrible on controller imo.

11/10 would sell my soul for this franchise

9080,"Now, I know what you're thinking when you see the ""Not Recommended,"" but hear me out. Borderlands is a fantastic game, with 2 sequels at this point, and a complete collection. The problem at hand with Borderlands 1 is that, with Gamespy having been shut down, there is no more multiplayer. This effectively sucks massive amounts of fun out of the game, and even makes it unplayable at some points. Don't get me wrong, this game is still VERY fun, but at times whenever   you're early level and you go down, only to discover your innacurate gun can't hit anyone, or there simply aren't any enemies left to get ""Fight to Survive,"" watching the health bar drain is soul crushing knowing that, if a friend were there, they could very well revive you.

It is possible, using Tunngle, to play multiplayer, but at some point the hassle simply becomes not worth it. Final verdict: 

Get Borderlands 2 or Presequel."
9081,very good and nice!
9082,very good and nice!

9089,"I DO NOT recommend this game. why? FOV locked and some minor must have pc settings gone from game. 
Play B2. Much better."
9090,"Got this game pretty cheap with all the DLC-s.
Didn't spend much time playing it but from what I saw this game is really good. REALLY good.
You get a million of weapons each having different stats. There are 4 classes to choose from.
You can drive a car that has either a machine gun or a rocket launcher. You fight various bosses.

9094,"Storyline thin, voice acting weak, comic relief obnoxious. Artificial Intelligence not challenging. Enemies run around a bit and find cover sometimes, but also just stand still in plain sight and fire at you, the game is really easy so you can play the storyline, but..."
9095,love this game
9096,Overated...
9097,9/10
9098,"Borderlands is a decent game. In my opinion, there was way too much running back and forth at the beginning.
Later on, they alleviate this with implementing a fast-travel system which is great.

Story was a bit lacking and the connection between the player and the NPCs weren't all that strong.
The artistic style and the shooting RPG gameplay were both well executed.

Overall, 8/10 is exactly what this game has been rated, and it's exactly what it deserves."
9099,great game fun and 80+ hours.
9100,it sucks

9103,Super game for CO-OP
9104,$1 on humble bundle right now
9105,gets really boring if you are not playing with friends
9106,I love this game. It's classic. Play all Borderlands games! They're awesome!
9107,"Very fun game (sometimes little hard to play solo, but hey) - makes up for his age with the cartoony graphics and awesome scriptwriting."
9108,"Overall it is a good game and I am happy that I have bought it on sale. There are two things that are frustrating. 

First: It is pretty repetitive, there are some minor changes in the missions but in the end it seems that the goal is just to get a better gun from the weapon box. It does get boring after a while. 

Second: The most frustrating thing about this game is fast travel limitations in the DLC. Throughout the game there are fast travel locations that make it very convenient and fun as you do not have to play the same thing over and over. In the DLC's it is not the case. I have been playing the Secret Armory of General Knoxx. It took me a good 2-3 hours to complete the final mission. As the credits were rolling the game crashed. I restarted it and I am in the main spawn room and have to do the same mission again, another 2-3 hours of exactly the same thing. It is so stupid that I was tempted to not recommend this game. Whoever came up with the saves for the DLC's really messed up and should be fired. 

As I said before, it is a fun game to play with friends or even by yourself. Another cool thing is that graphics are so low that even older computers should have no problems running it."
9109,yes
9110,If you plan on playing with your friends it's not as simple as joining his game. You'll need to get hamachi and do all sorts of witchcraft to be able to play with him. I don't recommend Borderlands 1 for people who don't want to play singleplayer. Other than that it's an amazing game.
9111,BAM! You dead!!
9112,"The gang leader I had to kill for a quest was 6 levels higher than me so I stood behind a fence and unloaded 600 revolver bullets into his skull for 12 minutes

9113,very good game and the price that i bught it awsume
9114,"5 reasons I love Borderlands:

1) Unique Graphic
2) The gameplay difficulty increases together with character's level
3) Hours of gameplay
4) The GOTY Edition at Steam Summer Sale 2015 for 7.49$
5) Lilith is hot

10/10 
"
9115,I got this game for one dollar with all the DLC so it was verry cheap for that price I do recomend this game because you can do many things in the game. So just click that Buy it now and play it and you are going to play for Hours and Hours
9116,-5/10 killed me out of boredom
9117,"- Finished that along with the 3 first dlc's on Xbox ( not the last one caus' i don kill claptraps )
- Borderlands offers the top coop experience
- No DLC storm like Borderlands 2

10 out of 10... Will play again on steam with my imaginary friends."
9118,"Just a warning. I also don't like the Halo games.  This is a shooter-looter-and-repeat game with a very thin story.  These games aren't fun for me.  I prefer narrative driven stories.  Without the gripping narrative, the game gets very repetitive.  I was planning on playing through the series, but now I probably will look for another game."
9119,"Not that fun. Enemies take ages to kill, so you're constantly running around grabbing ammo. Enemies keep respawning so back tracking through areas is incredibly tedious. Headshots don't kill if the enemy's HP is higher than your critical damage. It's only fun if you love to grind for ages and ages doing tedious side quests."
9120,"This Game is a Most Have If you played borderlands 2 and it is one best FPS ever made!!!!                    

                                       10/10 A Most have"
9121,This game is seriously so fun on CO-OP with friends on skype.
9122,"In my opinion a much better game then its sequal. The sequal is slow to start, has shitty level progression, throws too many weapons at you and does a poor job balancing all of that. The first game fixes all of that, not to mention combat is much much better. Gun sounds sound powerful and strong unlike the peashooters that you use in the second game. If you have a choice of buying this with all its DLC or its sequal buy this."
9123,"The gun feel is amazing compared to the second BUT the variety is extremely small and most jokes/story is only in text. Everything in this game is also very slow compared to the second and just try to fight overleveled enemies YOU WILL GET REKT.

Would rather recommend the second or pre-sequel but for a game from 2010 it's pretty good."
9124,like wanking with sandpaper 10/10
9125,"suck my ass this game tew gud
"
9126,The first of this great first person shooter series. Its highly enjoyable and doesnt take itself to seriously.
9127,one of the best game i ever played. i have more then 500hours in game when it wasnt on steam and i bought it for the nostalgia and play it through again . i rate 9/11
9128,Still a great shoot and loot FPS game. Reccomend for anyone over 13.
9129,one of the best games ever i played even tho its about 5 years old im still going back and playing it and its still fun
9130,Very nice :3
9131,Borderlands is and always has been  my all time fave FPS & Looting is always a plus. 10/10
9132,"The game it self keeps you entertained 
it challenges you , you will spend hours playing it 
I havent gotten bored once from it .  To me this game was worth the money spent . 
"
9133,"I bought this game for around $8 bucks (GOTY edition) because I've heard good things about it and decided to go for it.  I may only be a little bit into the game but I am very glad that I did go through with this purchase.

If you like shooters with a storyline then buy this game!"
9134,I bought this game on accident i wanted to buy the regular version not the GOTY but so far this game is pretty good im only at the killing nine toes but its awesome i would recommend
9135,"The game that started the Borderlands franchise.  Solid, although buggy.  Graphics are a bit dated, but it's still a fun coop game."
9136,"Such a good game with or without friends 
//GOOD//
/good story 
/good fps
/good guns
/good enemies 
/good variety

//slight issuse//
no fov slider 
(yep thats the kind of thing im saying it's so minor the when i saw it didn't have that i was like ""ow ok would have been nice but i get it"")
"
9137,"NOT as good as the second one, bu still deserves a few good awards. 8/10"
9138,Just Buy This god dam game no matter the price
9139,It was great until the last update broke it with no way to fix it with compatibility mode or fiddling with the game files. If you get it to work its amazing. Run around. Collect all the stuff. Slaughter everything. Get your friends copies. Purge everything that moves. Its got a good story and the it scales nicely. You cant just rush the story to get to the end. You have to work for ait a bit but its not overwhelming. It makes you experience the story but the story is good. And theres also the joy of slaughtering everything you encounter.
9140,I shot poop off a wind turbine!
9141,it is the best game that l have
9142,Do you like Bounty Boards then this game is for you!! To be fair the story is paper thin and the beginning of the game is very boring but the gameplay is great and the endless loot kept me coming back.  Check it out
9143,"i reccommend this game but one thing makes me not want to play it , when the game starts up normally after a while it will  freeze or crash the game why? and the background music still goes on"
9144,"If there was only one boarderlands game, then i would rate this 10/10

but

there isnt

so, its a firm 8/10, only beacuse they keep getting better!"
9145,"Great game. There is an incredible selection of guns in this game. A few of them are great, some of them are decent, and some of them are total trash. It's completely up to you! You can go with the decent guns, with minimal effort, or you can go for the great guns, most of which cost literally an arm and a leg. That's find with me, since I pick up and sell nearly everything I find. Man, how can my Roland even carry that much dough? The bandits seem to know that I'm loaded, and attack me at every opportunity. (Side note: That would be a badass game. Imagine a game where the bots know that you're rich, and try to rob you. That would be incredibly dope.)

Death can come at any time. Maybe you forgot to take care of that Badass Bruiser, and he's been following you around. Maybe the Rakk just don't like you. Or maybe you tried to take on a raid boss without any help. I've died many, many times, losing around $100 million dollars in the process. Damn that Crawmerax and his invincibility! You know a boss is insane when a maxed out Roland can't take him out alone, even equipped with four godlike Corrosive guns. 

Gr8 game, I r8 it 8/8."
9146,"Borderlands is basically the most fun you can have with your clothes on.

Or, you know, take them off. Whatever works for you. I'm not here to judge.

 Grab three friends and explore Pandora together - you won't regret it. 

"
9147,"Pretty much a must-have game for any open world shooter/RPG/Diablo fan.

It's an extremely fun open world romp that can be played as casual or hardcore as you want, with DLC's that just add extra flavorings to an already solid and complete base game.

The only downside to this game is how much life this game can suck out of you as you joyfully tear though this immersive world shooting and loot-whxxing."
9148,"Fun game, great humour, interesting story. What's not to love?"
9149,"This game is like jamming a hot key between two of your teeth then wriggling it around until it sinks deeper and deeper into your gum.

Actually, no,  that would probably give you an endorphin hit. Fuck this game."
9150,Fucking sucks whenever i start up the game it doesn't work it just says message general problem protection
9151,"Love the game idea its really cool all the weapons cars levels and a zombie level in my opinon its the best like THE BEST 
"
9152,WOOPA

9156,"Lets put it this way. What do we want from an RPG game ?  A massive world with hundreds of quest, a detailed power / stats system with unique character classes. Nice bossfights ,fun leveling system, lots of loot and long-term replayability. This game offers all of these things PLUS ITS MULTIPLAYER. And while in voice chat with your friends you can play this game for 1000 hours with awesome DLC's and Playtrough system. It's one of my favourite RPG's even though its kinda old.


[h1] Pros:[/h1]
- Massive world
- Around 250 fun quests
- Bazillion weapons / gear
- Unique artstyle and designs (For characters and enviroment)
- 4 Very fun and unique classes 
- Very impressive gameplay and fun shooting
- Great leveling system with multiple playtroughs
- Lots of content and endless playtime
- Nice and satisfying sound effects and voice acting
- Great presentation
- MULTIPLAYER !

[h1] Cons: [/h1]
- Weak story
- Lack of music
- No mini-map (is a lot frustrating then you might think of)
- Lots of bugs and stupid game mistakes
- Some missions are repitive and boring
- Unfair situations (f.e : flying bosses when you are playing melee berserker)
- Second wind system should be a bit less forgiving.

Overall Score:  8.5 / 10"
9157,"if u loved fallout, and half the grind fest in diablo u got to love this game.
why did i never play it before well it wasnt on sale before
it reminds me of so many old school games and yet is a whole game on it own
this is serious one of the reasons i started gaming.
meaning these kind of games this brings back so much good feeling about gaming.....
i just love it, wish i played it sooner ah well i got borderlands 2 still to play and i am not even halfway into this one...

10/10"
9158,"Fun game, the only thing I didn't like so much is that there aren't enough guides out there to teach you the basics. I know this is an open world game, but for newcomers you're gonna have a rough time getting to know how to play and how to build up your character"
9159,Great game worth a buy even better with friends.
9160,How can i miss this gold?
9161,I died a lot. I had to invite 2 friends to progress... We died a lot. Still fun <3
9162,"I recommend to play this before the second game because it shows how everything started, the gameplay, the visual style, the story and especially, the crazy, humorous, crude, random jokes the series is known for. I really like this game and this is because I am biased on FPSRPG's because I like these games more than others, but I think if you want a long game that has a lot of content this is a great buy. I think though other than the humor and visual style, one of the great things this game contributed is the randomly generated loot and weapons, which makes the game different each and every time. If you still don't want to play this game, I don't have anything else to say but please buy it for claptrap."
9163,"Worked for a day, then I started getting the dreaded 'General protection fault!"", with the accompanying page full of ""(filename not found)"".
It was fun while it lasted, but until this bug is fixed, I can not reccomend anyone buying this game."
9164,"""It's like Fallout mixed with a toned-down Grand Theft Auto.""

That statement is both true and false. This is definitely a wonderful and timeless game in my opinion. Advancing on the whole ""RPGs can be more than swords and dragons"" concept, Borderlands comes in with serious foolishness and it seems to happen wonderfully with a charm. 

Built rather comic-looking, the graphics, for sure, aren't gonna be the selling point, however, it has a likeness to it, whether its the bright displays of weaponry, wicked monster-creatures or even how disproportionately perfect the midgets are, the game does what it needs to in the visual department and keeps it at that. 

Built low-key, plays smoothly. I like the control and feel of the game. The way the weapon system works, the shooting, aiming (this is big for me and I honestly think that 2K nailed it nicely) even the grenade-throwing which is definitely remiscent of Halo 3/Reach with it's absolute Hail Mary'ness. Moving is wonderful although there's some moments in the game where the enviornment seems to be out to get you, but, I digress; love the infinite sprint, by the way.

The games seriously has a replay factor to it, in my opinion. It's long enough of a game that you can play it 2, 3, maybe even 4 times before you really catch and take in everything. Not to mention the fact that every single time you play it, you end up with a different set of guns which really does keep it fun. However, I think the addition that could've gone wonderfully with this game would've been an enemy AI that's constantly changing a la Left for Dead. But, I do think the idea of constantly going somewhere and there being the same enemy is rather helping to those that grind, which you won't HAVE to do but it IS fun, which returns me to my point, PLAYABILITY. It's fun enough to grind when you don't really need to. That says something to me.

In the end, Borderlands is fantastic. Good enough to spawn a franchise off. However I think the storyline of ""Finding a vault"" can get stale after a while, but if you're feeling gung-ho, love RPGs, FPSs and even some good old fashioned shameful humor (Midget Shotgunners that blow themselves back when they shoot, shooting Rakk crap off of turbines, Nine Toes Three Testicles, etc.).

9168,Highley recommend this game because of the story and the DLCs. the GOTY edition is a must have! however get on sale only!
9169,Great game!!!  It's a hell of a time sink =) Love the world of Pandora and the comic book art style <3
9170,Great game!
9171,Just so good !
9172,i had this game on crack 2 years ago but i bought it on steam this game is awesome really worth the monney                                               say a miget on a skag 11/10 would play
9173,"A blast to play with friends, just shoot everything that moves and keep improving your arsenal and skills."
9174,FIrst it's about the level then it's about the loot. This game is really fun and is similar to a fallout co op. There are heaps of missions to do for hours and hours of gameplay but most of those are a little grindy. The main missions are great and it's something really worth playing with a friend or even a group. Solo it's not as fun as this game was designed for co op and is honestly one of the best modern co op games today. For a game made in 2009 there are some things that are annoying such as having to constantly pick up ammo and walk/drive back and forth between places without insta fast travel. The storyline is pretty good and dlc adds pretty much double the game play and is worth the extra cash you paid. It's not useless DLC just get the goty edition on sale and have a blast. Don't compare this to the second one because the second one is just amazing. FPS Diablo 8.5/10
9175,Some of the best moments with my friends were had on this game! You should give this classic a try!
9176,"Don't let Steam fool you. With my laptop and old computer I have a combined 1200 hours in this game.
To say I have a problem would be putting it lightly. I can't count the number of times I've completed this game, uninstalled, and then reinstalled because one of my friends asked, ""Hey, do you want to play Borderlands with me?"" My new girlfriend just asked me yesterday to play, because she hasn't yet. Here we go again.

So many characters. So much time. So much fun."
9177,"Just recently completed the game (Not going to spoil it for people who haven't played yet) I would rate this game as a 5/5.

Story Line: 5/5
The story line is fun and there are a lot of twists and turns, there is also a lot of stupidity in it as well (humurous stupidity). You will more than likely put several hours into beating the story line, because you have to level up, find weapons, complete side jobs, it's a good story and afterwards you can go back and do the other side stuff.

Content: 5/5

Along with the story, as I mentioned previously, there are a LOT of side jobs to do. Along with the DLC, you will probably spend several more hours completing all of the side jobs. You also have levels, you level up to use new weapons and advance on your skill tree (which makes you more money and helps in other things as well). There is contless hours of things to do in this game.

Character Interactions: 5/5 (Hilarious!)

It's nice to see in a game where everyone has some form of dialouge, even if you can't actually interact with some of the characters. The dialouge is funny, and the intro for some of the enemies and their dialouge can be funny as well. When I first began playing I had a good time laughing at what some of the guys would say to you.

Weapons: 5/5

You may not be able to customize the weapons, which some may see as a downside, this is made up for by having so many weapons. There are so many different weapons to choose from; including machine guns, smgs, snipers, rocket launchers, shot guns, grenades, the list just goes on. Not to mention all of the weapons have different damage rates, firing speeds, some even have elements to make them better. 

This game may be a little bit of an older game now, it's still better than anything EA or Activision is making right now. As the Trailer says It's a RPFPS (Role Playing First Person Shooter). It's a wonderful game for anyone on most any PC, I can run it on a old 2009 macbook (bootcamp) that has DualCore 2.13ghz Processor, 9400m Nvidia Graphics, and 2GBs of ram, on low settings just fine! Definitely recommend this game."
9178,In my opinion it's better than the second game because you don't need to farm for hours on end to get end game gear.
9179,"This game runs smooth, plays nice and is a blast to goof off in, just watch out for the skags"
9180,Excellent franchise - A MUST BUY!!
9181,"The BEST out of ALL the borderlands games (the story is simple and the guns are VAST, no gimmick weapons except for eridian guns) the DLC can be VERY fun....modding is very few but can be the crowning jewel for this game! (unfortunately the successors make the guns gimmicky and less impressive with bosses that seemingly have too colossal health and shields!)

EDIT: even after YEARS, this game is STILL VERY fun! after years of gaining programming experience, I can conclude that mordecai is the best player especially when equipped with sniper rifles; here's why: 1: bessie does the BEST critical hit damage (500% + 100% from the sniper com and INFINITE AMMO due to ""Sniper Rifle Ammo Regen"") 2: Skullmasher: a sniper rifle that acts like a super tight spread shotgun (and it sends enemies flying if killed in one shot!), 3: kyros power/cyclops hybrid (healing bullets with the best scope in the game!), reaver's edge pentrator ""that's what she said!"" (it's a FULLY AUTOMATIC SNIPER RIFLE! it acts like a machine gun but better! it deals over a 1000 FULLY AUTOMATIC DAMAGE at max level, it easily outperforms ALL machine guns when combined with TRESPASS: a skill that allows mordecai to IGNORE SHIELDS!!!)

overall: 11 out of 10 would snipe enemies again (and I am doing youtube videos of mordecai with a sniper rifle only run)"
9182,"-I had played this game already on console and i loved it, now on the PC it's glorious. I think it has a very appealing art style and it's a very cool FPS  to play especially with friends. Totally recommend it. 

-IGN 11/10"
9183,"Pros:

- Visually stunning
- What I managed to get to of its story was pretty interesting
- Very unique game in world of ""post apocalyptic"" games. (though I know that doesn't entirely apply here)

Cons:
- Mind numbing
- Repetitive 

All in all, I WOULD recommend this game if you have someone to play with. But if you're going at it solo I really can't say you should play it. I'm really disappointed that I couldn't enjoy this game a little more, just because it IS so unique."
9184,even if this game is old its still a good game i might say
9185,"IMO one of the best games ever. I would say better than Borderlands 2, but they just feel completally different.
If you're ever in doubt of buying this game (and/or the 4 dlc's), just buy it. You won't be disappointed."
9186,What a game!!!
9187,"When I first downloaded the game and installed it I was unable to save the game while playing. I was also unable to save the video settings so the game would start out each time at low graphics/resolution even though my computer can max this game out. I searched the web and everyone said things such as checking that I have permissions to write in the folder where the game is stored, some suggested to check that you have save permissions in your saves folder. I ended up realizing that the save folder was not created for some reason. So I copied my friends borderlands folder (where he saves) and then after adding that file I was able to save both video settings and new characters. hopefully this is helpful for someone. 

This game is incredible though and I love the borderlands series. I already played 1 and 2 on 360 and PC."
9188,"Do you enjoy the worlds of Mad Max and Fallout 3 but without lovable, memorable characters and stories?

Do you enjoy the gunplay of Fallout 4 but without weapon modification and with poor balancing?

Do you enjoy the poorly implemented vehicle controls from Duke Nukem Forever?

Do you enjoy World of Warcraft's quest system but with less interesting, more tedious objectives?

If you fit any of the above criteria, then this is the game for you!"
9189,"This game paved the way into something very very different , this is a must by for anyone who enjoys random comedy , playing with friends , loot lots of loot. Must Buy."
9190,"One of the greatest games ever made. (The second is way better but do NOT miss the first).
Pros-
-Numerous amount of guns
-Great variety in enemies
-The map is very large
-The graphics and art to this game is up there with the best
-Quite a bit of humor revolving around enemies and friends alike

Cons-
-Almost the whole game is set in the desert and it can get bland after hours and hours

Buy this on sale or full price. You'll love it."

9199,Best game ever. 'Nough said.
9200,Best Gun Looting porno ever                 10/10
9201,"I'm not big on FPS, but this one is a bit different. It's less like a first person shooter and more like Diablo from the first person view. The game doesn't depend totally on the skill of a player, but neither does it depend totally on your character build. It's a nice balance of the two that make it so fun to play."
9202,This game is truly amazing. The gameplay is fantastic and the loot is tremendous.
9203,Coop and guns what more do you need? expect maybe more guns but it has that too.
9204,"Not as great as the second one but still a good RPG-Shooter.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*] good weapon realistic (especially sound and feeling)
[*] far better wasteland atmosphere then the second one
[*] flying enemies are much easier and better to hit
[/list]

[b]Contas:[/b]
[list]
[*] the menus are a bit too texty
[*] bullets are like in the second one far too slow
[*] alone sometimes a bit boring (I recommend to play with a coop partner)
[*] missions are monotonous (like in the early state of WoW: kill an amount of X enemies and sometimes a boss)
[/list]"
9205,salright
9206,"While Borderlands 1 is a very fun game to start the series. This game is SO poorly optimized for PC. All of the basic functions of a PC game are just flat out missing and it takes a LOT of modding and tweaking just to make the game run at a barely playable level. The Field of View is the worst culprit as it is constantly force zooming in and out as you are playing.

Pros:
- It's a very good game if you get it for console or have never played a Borderlands game.
- Worth the hassle if you bought it at 90% off (do not buy if it doesn't hit at least 90% off)

Cons:
- UNBELIEVABLE shipped state. Barely works at a base level.
- A lot of modding and research is needed to make the game ""playable""

Verdict:
- Do not buy unless it is less than 2 bucks and you want to mess around for a few hours.
- Definitly worth on consoles. Just not here."
9207,"Just started playing this with a friend, The co-op part is still amazing after all this while."
9208,"This game is great, I could tell you why but there are other reviews for that."
9209,"10/10 amazing, as of when I'm writing this I've barely played and I can already tell It's one of my favourites."
9210,fun with friends
9211,"If you have completed Borderlands 2 and are considering playing this, don't.  It is a major step down from BL2.  If you are considering buying this and haven't played BL2, just go ahead and pick up BL2."
9212,i can write a review but i dont have the game 10/10
9213,dat boi
9214,"Overall, the game is worth the money for all those gamers who enjoy playing with a small group of friends or love looting. Still the game has various noticeable flaws which can have you caught in some pretty weird and awkward situations."
9215,very good game 10/10
9216,Golden
9217,"IMO, Borderlands isn't as good as its sequel, but even so because Borderlands 2 is so good, it makes this so much easier to appreciate. BL2 has better graphics, 1st person gameplay, weapons, RPG elements, characters... EVERYTHING, but I still like the first Borderlands simply because of the ideas and settings it brought about, the RPG/FPS hybrid gameplay, the loot system (quote, ""Bazillions of guns""), the Mad Max-esque characters and locations, and how it still (kinda) holds up compared to its sequel (and The Pre-Sequel). 
Really the only major complaints that I have with this game are that the world isn't colorful enough, and that the story is rather simple, but lacklustre and hard to follow considering the amount of quests there are to do in the game.
Still though, they don't detract from the main experience all that much, and even after playing through Borderlands 2 twice or three times on 4 different platforms, this is still good retrospective fun!
Get it whenever you can, but it's better you grab this on a sale, especially when you go for the GOTY edition!"
9218,Great fun and a lot of variety with the DLC. A bargain too.
9219,"If you are looking for a action filled shooting games, with friends or solo, this game is it! Borderlands is by no means a cartoon game, and is filled with quite the amount of blood, spilled guts and limps. The game is level based, which makes it much more handy to play, so you can't just one shot an enemy and kill them, at least not in the higher levels. The main quest is filled with surprises, action, violence, comedy, thrills and much more. It is packed with hours of gaming, aside from the countless side quests and DEL quests, the vanilla game itself is amazing. You are even able to customize your own character, name and abilities. Whether or not you attack from a distance or face the enemies head on, both play styles are ""supported"" with the different characters. 

The game has a variety of weapons, how many I do not know, however there are more than I could ever count.. Some weapons are very unique, and will display different shooting animations, which is nice. However, back to the game. If you have played a lot of FPS games, than you will not be disappointed with this game, it has everything. The Game of the Year edition, has everything included, and you will not be bored at all. 

To summarize. Borderlands is an action filled FPS game, that never gets boring. Once you finish the game, the game has a special treat for you in store and makes it worth the while. The DLC's are also packed with action, which is a nice addition to the vanilla game, however, even the vanilla game is amazing by itself."
9220,Excellent game. Could not stop playing.
9221,Awesome!
9222,one of the best if not the best game ever
9223,"Very late getting into this Franchise, but I'm already liking what I am seeing (A LOT). Logged about 8 hours so far and just can't stop playing. Really looking forward to finishing out this franchise after grabbing the Pre-Sequel on the Summer Sale this week :)

Don't even think twice about buying this game. Very unique mix of RPG elements and FPS action, not to mention great characters, graphics, storyline blah, blah, blah.... Stop reading this and buy it already."
9224,"This game is awesome after you've tweaked it correctly (intro skips, Vsync, FOV).
11/10 you must totally try/buy it.

In 3 months, this is the first game to actually interest me."
9225,"STRIP THE FLESH, SALT THE WOUND AHAHAHAHA"
9226,"Man, i am sooo dissapointed. I purchased this game simply to play Duke Nukem Forever and I can't find out how! I am so mad I can't play Duke Nukem Forever, one of the best game ever made. Sadly I have to play this slightly worse game known as Borderlands instead.

Serously, in all honesty Borderlands is amazing, buy it now... Now!"
9227,This game is good
9228,STRIP THE FLESH! SALT THE WOUNDS!
9229,"The cell shaded graphics look awesome and seem appropriate for the game somehow. The comedy in the game is unique and full of surprises. Always has me laughing in some way. Even after hundreds of hours of game time.

RPG. FPS. Friends. And lots of shiny weapon drops. What more can you ask for?"
9230,I don't even own GOTY of Borderlands but it says I do. 0/0 I don't even know.
9231,"Very Nice game,i Hugely Recommend it,Tottaly worth Buying"
9232,Eyyyy
9233,.
9234,Borderlands is one hell of an awesome game.
9235,Oh god no. Did not like this at all.
9236,i don't usually play FPS games but i really REALLY think i'm in love with this game.
9237,"If you played Borderlands 2 and came to buy the first then you won't expect much but the same amount of fun. Plus, you get to play as the first few crew members (Roland, Lilith, Brick, Mordecai) and get to experience the story before the other games.

My only wish was they had more characters like in the second one and a bit more DLC.. but this was where it all started so they can't simply do that.

Mad Moxxi too man. I love her. 

11/10"
9238,I love this game!!!
9239,2 is better
9240,"As my first loot-raid-fps game, I am not expert at this genre, but I can assure you that you would have fun if you love twisted humor, insane robots(DLC) and again, insane robots(another DLC).

When you are on it, get GOTY Edition of this game, it definitely worths it."
9241,"

It actually runs on a potato 11/10 IGN."
9242,"Think of Super Mario Sunshine, but better."
9243,"There's nothing like the thrill of shooting three rockets at once at a level 69 midget who could level your ass with a shotgun before flying backwards onto his back from the recoil. Get this game! You'll get your money's worth and more, I PROMISE. Hop in with a friend or two-- or three, or make new friends!  Who knows? People have LITERALLY gotten married over Borderlands! Anyways, go shoot some damn midgets in the face with an explosive shotgun"
9244,"Borderlands is by far one of my favorite games. It is the type of game that has a story to guide you but still gives you plenty of free will to do which ever mission you choose.It is the right level of difficulty to provide a challenge but not frustrate you with amount of death tax. It is an over all staple game for any steam account. 

Plus, Claptrap can be pretty funny."
9245,My playtime speaks for itself.
9246,"Haven't written a review before, but here goes. I'm very much a fan of this game. I really enjoy the combination of rpg and fps gameplay, as well as the art style. I'm not much of a gamer, so I hadn't seen anything like it before. Pretty challenging bosses, REALLY funny dialogue, the music really grips me sometimes. Getting headshots is a little harder than in Borderlands 2, but that doesn't stop me from trying for the Brain Ventillator acheivement. Definitely more content and longer gameplay than any other game I've played. I highly recommend this game and the second installment."
9247,"An extremely good game that is fun to play all the way through. It really comes alive when you have friends to play co-operatively, but is still good fun even on your own. You don't need to max it out with four players, as the difficulty will scale with the number of players in-game, but it's definately a fun, social experience to play with three friends all the way through if you can.

The biggest negative about this game is the ending, which i won't spoil. I just want to say that given the experience of the build-up and how much fun it was all the way through, the ending felt like they just ran out of money, couldn't afford to put in a proper ending and just went ahead and released it like that. Still, it WAS great fun all the way through, and the unsatisfying ending is what sequels are for, right?..."
9248,maybe there should be an update wher e if we already had the game we still only pay the sale price as in the 14.99 and i can get my 15 dollars back
9249,"game gives you more and better loot than presequel or 2 combined

[b]Ned's Island[/b]: fun and dead
[b]Underdome[/b]: play it for the 2 skill points on both playthroughs then never touch it again (barely rewards you)
[b]Armory[/b]: new loot, more loot, more enemies, more driving (bad), and the best finale for a dlc also raid boss
[b]Robolution[/b]: fun and red"
9250,"As a senior Citizen . I'm clearly outnumbered heere, but Borderlands is frankly a Blast!"
9251,"If Diablo was a First Person Shooter it would be Borderlands

8/10 Verdic: Missing Handsome Jack"
9252,"I liked this game for many reasons but there were some things I didn't like
Pros
*Its a first-hand shooting game
*The story was pretty good
*The characters were good
*You get to kill as much as you want and collect a lot of things like weapons and class mods
Cons
*The echo device you get at the beginning of the game is a little bit bugged out for specific missions
*The story doesn't connect well with borderlands 2 if you don't get the downloadable content
*You have to change a lot of things to the computer settings in order tp play this game in multiplyer
*Only Mordecai's action skill is decent in the game in my opinion

I recommend getting the game of the year edition when it goes 75% off or getting it with Borderlands 2
I have played this game for many hours and still I have enjoyed this game."
9253,"Absolutely horrid compared to BL2, could barely stand playing this game."
9254,"Great game, definitly do the GOTYE"
9255,Best game of the year.
9256,"A crazy murder brawl of action guns and lots of awesome kills
Highly suggested
can be used on low lvl pcs

9257,always badass
9258,+
9259,Best of the series and an all time classic.
9260,The game that started it all. 10/10 would play again.
9261,"It's 1am, I have an ammunition regenerating gun and an almost endless supply of badguys ............ Hit it !"
9262,game is ok
9263,"This game can be considered old but it sure is a good game to stay passing time with and not get bored. I mean hunting, shooting, killing, looting... Sounds like the perfect game no? Well it is!!!! Trust me ;)"
9264,Not a fun game.
9265,If this game could make a sandwich i would marry it <3
9266,I can't play it for some reason it says General Protection Fault what ever that is.
9267,"A Psycho was trying to say ""Strip the flesh, Salt the wound"" I shot him so many times he couldnt finish 10/10"
9268,"The first 30 minutes of the game were fun, but the rest of it just felt like a chore. The game has you doing the same thing for about 20 hours: get an objective, run & gun your way through some enemies, collect an item, return to original objective giver, repeat. The story is rather sparse, and I never reached the point where I felt immersed.

Graphically, the engine did not age well. I played through 6 years after release with a pair of 970s and the screen tearing is crazy, almost unplayable.

I finished this game only because I didn't way to feel like I had just thrown away my money.

I played through on single-player, but I could see where this would be more entertaining playing with friends. However, as a single-player game, I cannot recommend this title."
9269,Best game ever.
9270,"Wow its a very nutty game boys, ive played 2 and the pre sequal before ive played this and that was a mistake, this one is the nuttiest by far, sick weapon models compared to the other 2. 

9/11 very dank meme will play more and would buy again"
9271,"acting like a hunter, playing like a soldier. not so bad not so good but there are so many time to lose. 9/10"
9272,Not as enjoyable without the couch co-op. Friends are almost a neccesity with this game.
9273,Did you know that Borderlands in China is a free-to-play game called 无主之地OL ?
9274,"I'd say if you have played Borderlands 2/pre-sequel, you don't know what the true Borderlands experience feels like. Coz they are not. It's this one right here."
9275,"A great game. 
I especially liked shooting and art in this game.
Overall there are not many things that annoy me in this game.
Melee attacks are sometimes pretty random and hard to control but that is only a nitpick.

9/10 Would play this again.

"
9276,"Disclaimer: I did not finish the game.

Fun for the 21 hours I put in, but I lost intrest in it. Best played with people you know"
9277,"The game that gave me the ""Borderlands virus"". Been looking for a cure since 2011. No such luck."
9278,"[h1] Long Review [/h1] (short review at the bottom)
This game is amazing, it's an FPS RPG that has a stunning art style and a lot of replay value.

The main purpose of this game is basically leveling up and getting loot.
The story isn't all that, there is little to no voice acting, so if that's the only thing you care about in video games, you'll probably not gonna like this game.

Although the graphics are a bit old, especially the low resolution texture and shadows, the art style they used (cel-shaded) really holds up the game even for modern gaming.
Some graphic problems can be fixed, like adjusting FOV, enabling Vsync and Anti Aliasing, but personally I haven't tried them because I didn't feel it was neccessary.

[h1] Negative Points [/h1]

There are a few problems with the game, so I'm gonna list what mostly bothered *me*, maybe you won't care about these problems, and maybe you won't experience them, so it's just my opinion.
[list]
  [*]Some glitches happen sometimes, the worst I got was in the Underdome DLC where enemies would spawn/fly off outside the arena and there's no way you could kill them, and you'd have to do it all over again (can take up to 3 hours)

  [*]Some of the achievements are ridiculous, like the Claptrap's New Robot Revolution DLC where you have to collect a bunch of *VERY* rare drops [Spoiler] (like pizzas and bobbleheads) [/Spoiler] and I haven't gotten all of these achievements yet, even though I've already put hours into drawn-out farming and grinding.

  [*]The Underdome DLC has these ""larger challenges"" where you basically have to play 3 hours back-to-back, 3 times (so 9 hours in total, #Maths) and if you quit or disconnect (or get the above glitch) you'll have to do it all over again, which is just painful.

  [*]The DLCs don't have any ""Fast Travel"", so you'll spend a *LOT* of time just running around from place to place, especially in ""The Secret Armory of General Knoxx"", which to be fair, has a lot of ""Catch A Ride"" stations (for cars), but it still takes too long to get somewhere.
[/list]

[h1] Positive Points [/h1]

And now my most favourite things this game has to offer
[list]
  [*]The variety of weapons: which is what -I believe- makes this game standout.

  [*]Replay value: when you finish the game, which is a quite linear mission flow with a bunch of side missions, you get to play it again in a second ""Playthrough"". you get to keep your weapons, keep your level, skills, and basically everything from the first playthrough, but you'll face stronger opponents and better loot. and this system works perfectly (apart from overleveling and making it too easy).

  [*]The Multiplayer: in this game is what I would call ""Perfect"", the entire party gets experience from every single kill, and they all get cash from loot and doing missions, the only thing not shared is the loot itself, which I still prefer, especially since different classes require different weapons/gear.

  [*]The DLC: is really good, it's almost the ideal DLC a gamer would want: it adds a lot of content, increases level cap, adds more weapons, interesting backstory, more achievements etc.. the game by itself is really good, but with the DLC it's even better.
[/list]

The game is not very long, but it takes a decent amount of time to 100%.
And it is a LOT better to play with friends (more experience, more fun, and more co op achievements).

[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
Game good.
RPG very.
Story not very.
Friends invite.
DLC buy.
Collectibles bad."
9279,It's not as good as borderlands2 which I have played on other systems but it's still an enjoyable game.
9280,I bought this from sale and its fucking lovely :D
9281,"Great game.  Loved the comic book style and the sense of humor.  Loot became a little too easy to find and not much worth purchasing with it.  Definitely in on future franchise games.  The car driving and travel became a little monotonous because the missions themselves aren't all that unique, but overall one of my favorite games."
9282,Just buy it on sale and play it.
9283,Best co-op ever. Period.
9284,Let me start by saying that I did enjoy this game for the short time that I played it. Everything is great about the mechanics and the graphics and all of the other tech stuff. The story is plain flat and boring after a while. A friend recomended that I just skip this game and go straight to the second. Holy crap is the second lightyears better in all of the best ways. Bottom Line is that you shouldn't pay more than $15 for this.
9285,i didn't enjoy it all that much at first. but as i play more and more it becomes more enjoyable. and that's the mark of a good game. playing though the first on my 2nd playthough and looking forward to playing the 2nd borderlands after im though with this one
9286,"Really good and challenging game, love it!"
9287,better than 2
9288,This was the best of the franchise imo  Great and unique.
9289,"
Borderlands is an awesome game, at the time of the release it was very innovative, the graphics are nice and smooth, a  cel shading cartoon style that fits perfectly with the Wasteland.

Game play are great, it´s an FPS open world with some RPG elements so you gonna evolve and get better weapons during game.  Every weapon has it own characteristics and you have like thousands of combinations so you will always be comparing guns and managing inventory.  Sniping is awesome is this game. If you hit a headshot you get a critical but that doesn´t mean the enemy will die, it will depends on the stats level of you and the enemy.

 It´s a strange world, sort of a steampunk wild west, and the enemies are total freaks.  You have a lot of things to do and will spend many hours in this game, also have a lot of DLC and all are great.  

Borderlands 2 are awesome too but for me this game are as good as the sequel."
9290,"A great game when it came out. One of the funnest things you could do is scour a barren planet for guns, ammo, various loot, and destroy hordes of aliens and bandits with friends. This game lets you do all of that and more. But since Borderlands 2 came out (and of course, the pre-sequel), it's probably better if you get one of those, as they are more polished, balanced, and overall, a better experience. If however your would like to experience one of the best Co-Op Series of all time from the beginning, then by all means, have at it. One thing though; Borderlands 1 is not as comical as the rest of the series. I found the other games in the series to induce laughter in me and several friends to a better effect."
9291,Love this game it never gets old....
9292,"An old classic game that me and my friend managed to dig it out and play through it years later

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yh59kLWCOE&list=PLyWHbh1Uf0OtJy28zQW0govxu0yZZLfXO"
9293,"I'am a big fan of the Borderlands games, if you like or even love Borderlands, going back to where it all started is a must and fun."
9294,"I started playing Borderlands 2 with some friends and after playing Borderlands 2 I started Borderlands. I is as much fun as Borderlands 2 and I don't have a problem with the grafics. 
The story is as good as in Borderlands 2 so if u started with Borderland 2 and think about playing Borderlands do not hesitate.
"
9295,Fun game.
9296,"This is a good game that is rightfully overshadowed by it's squeal: Borderlands II. At the time when Borderlands was released, it provided great art style, a lot of good game play (but gets old by the second play through), and good humor. Borderlands II took all of this to 11. Also the difficulty is a little off (too easy at parts) due to the leveling system, but that is unavoidable with a game like this. Luckily the developers converted the multiplayer from GameSpy to Steamworks, when GameSpy died. They also removed Securom from both the core game and DLC making it a much better game to run. The DLC is a mixed bag, but is worth playing if you are playing if you are playing this game. 8/10 good game, but buy Borderlands II instead, if you like it come back to this game."
9297,"An exellent loot and shooter. Funny on your own, even funnier with a group of friends."
9298,A fun mix of RPG and Shooter. One of my favorite games!
9299,Awesome ....I spent a good part of my life enjoying this game.
9300,"This is an amazing game. The atmosphere is dull and gritty, giving it a more mature and serious vibe. You are a vault hunter, who wants to find a vault, said to contain a crapton of loot inside. You will encounter allies who will help you along your way, and of course, millions of enemies who will try and kill you. It's a great start to the Borderlands franchise."
9301,"Great cel-shaded graphics. Excellent hybrid between FPS and ARPG, awesome Co-op fun and humor to boot."
9302,"One of the locals said he would like to wear my face on his. I've named him Susan. Susan will learn his place

10/10"
9303,Boring as hell and repetitive quests will give you a cancer.
9304,"A game that traverses a few genres while almost creating one of its own. Whatever you want to call it, it's a damn fine game albeit a little bit of a hard slog at times.

Important: This game is immeasurably better when played with friends, you can play it all by yourself but these games are built for co-op.

Fun if you have the time, energy and capable friends."
9305,This is one of the best games out there. Fun to play with friends or go at it alone.
9306,"Quite the fun game If you have the time to play it. Compared to the other borderlands game, lacks the visuals (and that's all)
Plenty of content for a person to play for hours and you can always restart and play the other characters
Love kill and loot games :)
8/10"
9307,"While this is older than Borderlands 2, and it shows, the gameplay was still pretty good. Good game overall!"
9308,best game in the whole wide world
9309,"+Everything 


-AI not that smart (keep doing same automatic things e.g. : hide behind a fence, run to barel, go back to the same fence)
-Accuracy in guns is way off (sniper cant sometimes hit target 5 meters away)
-Same looking enemies"
9310,"Of course, dude"
9311,FUN 2 PLAY
9312,"It's okay. Unlike the sequel, this is not a great game. It's mediocre. The gunplay isn't as fun, the character skill trees aren't as interesting, the dialogue isn't as funny, and I spent roughly three hours of my time with the game simply commuting. That's very bad. I couldn't even bring myself to play the DLC I was so annoyed with it by the time the story ended."
9313,"Fun with one or more friends, but gets very repetitive even before you've finished it once. Lots of level grinding, which I just don't find fun.

I imagine in single-player it's excruciating, so don't bother buying unless you have willing friends."
9314,"I love this game, ever dlc is great, the action is fun, and the enemies are hilarious and scary at the same time. I had so much fun playing this game I was kind of sad to see it to the end."
9315,Just got this game but I love it.  Great game.  Classic Bordeland game.  One of the best games I have played.
9316,"Borderlands offers a very fun open-ended game with a hell of a lot of guns and gear to find. If you do purchase the game, I would highly suggest getting the Game of the Year edition with all the DLC. The baseline game is fun, but it can be fairly short to play through once. Adding additional story, levels, and even more loot really makes the game shine through.

Final rating: 8/10 - Very good. 

Give it a whirl. You won't regret it."
9317,its like you're playing quake but it's actually diablo a+ would loot again
9318,While it is not as polished as the following games I think I liked this more than borderlands 2.  I feel like the classes were more interesting and many of the guns were better and more varied.
9319,echt nice
9320,"Used to play this game a lot when it was new and I never got bored of it. Six years later and I can still play this game all over again without getting bored. Amazing game, story and DLC."
9321,"Don't know why just don't like this game. I have it installed and every time I look for something to play I look at this and think, I really can't be bothered to play this game :/"
9322,"I recently completed this game and I thought I'd tell everyone what I thought of it. Note, this game is outdone by Borderlands 2, but that does not change the fact that this is also a fantastic game.

The Bad:
The story is quite short
Not much voice acting for the NPCs
Doesn't look very pretty

The Good:
SO MANY GUNS
Fun characters
Cartoony graphics
Violent, bloody
Claptrap
Decent Story
A fucking great Sequel

Buy this game, but more importantly, buy the second one. This series is the best I've ever played in the 10 or so years I've played games. BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT NOW"
9323,First time playing any Borderlands on PC.  10x's better than any console gamers dreams.  This game was meant to play on the PC.  Feels like I've been reborn lol.
9324,"pretty interesting shooter/rpg hybrid. Heavily loot based, and absolutely best played in coop with friends

+different graphic style, in a good way
+tons of loot...especially guns
+solid shooting mechanics and rpg style character progression
+lost of stuff to do

-pretty easy to just go ahead shooting bad guys without caring for the story at all (I know I did)
-some very tedious sections involving endless travelling through the same areas (particulary in the last dlc)
-Some annoying connection, sound, and other bugs affecting coop play

all in all, a pretty fun game :)"
9325,"The beginning of one of my favorite franchises of all time, Borderlands is some of the most fun I've ever had playing a game.  I've played it with friends, I've played it alone, but it's always a great time.  If you want a fun shooter that mixes RPG elements easily and fluidly, Borderlands is for you."
9326,"Great overall design. Love the guns, The vehicles, even though there's only 1 available to use. Awesome story and great multiplayer experience and AWESOME SOUNDTRACK! Although I haven't tried playing it with strangers. I would definitely recommend this game and play it with your friends. GREAT GAME anyways! 10/10! :D"
9327,It's a alright game the graphics are awesome but this game is hard for me ;-;.
9328,I'm loving this game.
9329,I highly reccommend this game and I don't even own the damn thing :D
9330,"Borderlands is a great game, and one of very few that has great co-op support.

Good writing, interesting graphics, and tons to do make it a great game to enjoy with friends."
9331,"Its awesome game and you should buy it!The thing I hate is that it kinda force's you to buy Borderlands 2,it has really bad ending wich will disapoint you very hard.It has about 15-16 hours if you are new at the game and could take longer if you are new to this type of game.
Tl""DR=Get it as soon as its on sale with BL2."
9332,"Borderlands is a game I love dearly. It took me forever to get into it but once I did, it was no longer monotonous and boring but fun and engaging. 

This being the first in the series I felt it was a little reserved. The humour is a little toned down, the game play is a little more ""standard"". Which is fine. Had it been a stand alone game I wouldn't have even noticed but comparing it to the others that later come out, this is definitely the conservative older brother. 

But it's not fair to compare games to their successors is it? Let's talk about this solely. 

You are a Vault Hunter on Pandora and you are looking for... well, the Vault. On your quest you find  a myriad of quirky individuals that are willing to help you if you help them with missions in return. Sometimes there's so many side quests you don't know where to start but luckily if you wish to neglect them and just play the missions you have to in order to progress the game, you can do just that. I, however, like to knock them out as they come. 

What the highlight for me about this game is whoever you choose to be really affects how you play because they each have their own abilities. For instance if you decide to be Mordecai you can send out Bloodwing to help kill your enemies, collect health or money for you, and you're stellar with Pistols and Sniper Rifles. But say you want to be Lilith instead. While she may not have a companion she can Phase-Walk as she pleases and throw enemies out of the fight. So it's a good idea to pay attention to their attributes because you might like how one plays/levels up more so than others. Or just play with them one by one eventually. 

The game mechanics are pretty standard for an FPS which I appreciate. I feel they were very revolutionary and new with a lot of the game such as the story telling but kept the actual playability classic which really helps you get into it faster. Even when I thought I hated this game, I liked that it played similar enough to other games that when friends wanted to play with me multi-player, it was a no brainer to dive into especially if I'd just come from playing a different game in a different genre. 

Anyway, pick up this game if you haven't yet and I strongly suggest you start this one first. That is all."
9333,game sucks
9334,"This game mixes three of my favorite games types and mixes them all in seamless. An FPS/RPG/Open-World game with pretty good Multiplayer! The pacing of the game was just right. Never a dull moment. Most importantly: The guns. Oh so many different guns! Half the fun is finding a better gun. The more people you play with, the better the guns you'll get! The online population has dropped lately though."
9335,"Hated this game at first.  I wanted to play the girl,  and it was horrible.  Tried to play the Hunter because, was finally able to play the game.  10/10 Would gender swap again."
9336,the amount of content in this game is incredible. must have for fps gamers.
9337,This is it. The one that started them all... well of the Borderlands series anyway. Although  a bit dated it can still hold its own among new titles and pound for pound arguably one the best games of all time. Whether it's on sale or regular retail it's worth every penny. This gets a solid 9 of 10.
9338,"Great game, worth the time and effort, even though it's six years old, it still stands up to modern games."
9339,"Hello Nevada! ... Uhm Sahara? Death Valley? Uhm my neighbors bucket of sand with maggots crawling in it? Eh fuck it lets just call it Pandora (Not the box or the lush green/blue planet chock full of blue space monkeys).

Borderlands is supposedly set on a planet called Pandora (not sure why you would name a planet after a box that has death in it... OH WAIT, NEVERMIND THEN) and the story revolves around 4 idiots who came here to look for fairy tales and a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow made of meat bicycles... On second thought i might not have gotten what the game was about in the first place.

Don't get me wrong this is my favorite franchise right after the Bioshock one, its just that Borderlands 1 (the one this review is about) doesn't feel like a full game to me. Not without the shit ton of DLC that is.
All in all the gameplay is fun, you'll never find a gun that you'll stick with for more than a couple of hours and god forbid you actually find a legendary weapon, the controls are tight and responsive (not counting the vehicle controls... yuck.) and throwing your pet bird/falcon mutant at a midget yelling about stripping flesh always ends with a barrel full of fun :D

And shotgun shells..."
9340,Beautiful
9341,not as good as 2 but worth a shot
9342,Great Game - Good for 4 player PVE
9343,"""You don't need to be a better shot, you just need to shoot more bullets."" [i]-Marcus Kincaid[/i]

9344,One of my all time favorite games.
9345,Recommended
9346,"Amazing shooter-rpg, even though it's a bit old, it's still very fun and addicting, especially when you play with friends"
9347,"good game 
 purples are actually good!!!"
9348,After being addicted to BL2 on PS3 I bought this game and not surprisingly it was absolutely amazing! Definitely one of favorite games now!
9349,"As much as I am usually one NOT for FPS's... This game is a lot of fun and very challenging! At first I was very reluctant to purchase it and try it... but after a couple of my friends were playing it, and it can be played co-op... I figured... WHY NOT!? :) It's a bit tricky as a newbie to get the hang of, or if you're not one for FPS's. But eventually you start understanding how to play, how to play your class, and how to make your character better; i.e. weapon upgrades, which skills to go after, and what weapons you should have in place of others.

All in all? I would give this a 10/10 to play. It has a really great story line. It's challenging in multiple aspects, and all-in-all? It's a great game to play; solo or co-op! ^^ Give it a go!"
9350,"Even during 2016 this is still a top game. A great starting point for the Borderlands.
9/10"
9351,lock load and reload
9352,"Horrible grindy brown walking simulator where it takes 2 full magazines to the face to kill anything, and it takes forever.
The enemies are shit and boring to fight.
All the abilities are passive and shit.
Everything is brown. And shit.
There are 900 giga trillion guns and they're all shit.
All the characters are awful, the plot is awful, then the ending just shits directly into your eye sockets."
9353,"One of the best looter shooters, Weak story but gameplay makes up for it!"
9354,Pretty good game. I played solo and it would have been much better with a team. Good humor and solid game play.
9355,Play it. you'll know.
9356,Lots of replay value.  Love it
9357,"Great game, except for T-Bone Junction where you have to get a vehicle and drive, and drive, and drive, where the hell is fast travel?"
9358,"MORE,,,MORE MEAT FOR MEE MuHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA"
9359,"Borderlands is a FPS, loot based RPG-ish game, the games story in itself is good and satisfies mostly, even if at points it seems to be long winded and drawn out. The gameplay is good, with responsive and accurate controls. The skill system is good but it doesn't force you to go down on tree, you can mostly complete all of the three trees for your chosen character. The characters are all fun to play as and have extremely different skills. The weapons are all randomly generated and are all fun to use in their own way. The DLC is good and adds to a already well made story, bringing more loot and new enemies. Overall this game is fun to play alone, and with friends, definitely worth a buy, and if you enjoy it get the DLC to make the game longer."
9360,Very great GAME Rich In weapons and storyline 9/10
9361,"Meh. Shooting mechanics suck too much, and the game itself is rather bland and boring."
9362,"This game is an RPS or Role-playing Shooter (Cross between a role-playing game and a first person shooter). It's basically lots of subtle humor, lots of shooting, lots of looting, all set in a barren backwater planet called Pandora. There are four characters, and each specialize in different weapon types and have unique skill trees which you can build on upon leveling up as well as unique action skills. At this point the online is mostly dead. There are still some that play but matchmaking can be tough if characters have made different progress through the story so I recommend playing with a group of friends and keeping everyone together for the whole playthrough, or just playing alone because I find this game can also be very enjoyable by yourself even though it was designed for co-op. Just about the only weakpoint of this game is how detached the story is, but for me this didn't matter at all because I'm all about gameplay and storyline is just an optional topping. I would 100% recommend this game to anyone. Many people prefer Borderlands 2, but I've played both and I hate the second one. The first is infinitely better in my opinion."
9363,RPG + FPS = FTW. The only thing I'm not super fond of is collecting and selling off a billion random dropped weapons.
9364,"Based solely on a playthru as Lilith the Siren

Spoilers: This game is fun. Also - The General Knox DLC needs die in a fire. You will understand my feelings when you drive off, are driven off, or get punted off the road and die and lose 4 million dollars in death fees just trying to complete this DLC.

General Knox is a tragic figure though, he reminds me of my dad. Dedicated to the notion of seeing the job thru, no matter how many strange homeless people get in his way. Like the time we were at the worksite and this guy had a knife, thankfully dad had a gun, and the guy ran off.

So this game, you have many guns, so you win everything forever.

Which includes a really fun game. If you buy it. I bought it on Sale - I have the Steamdoku, but for this game? I beat it. 57 hours for one playthrough as I am extremely casual and kind of lame. But Hours For Dollars? This game was amazing and I will never forget it. 

When a hot skinny chick says 'Sup' to me on the street, I dodge for cover and expect an invisible ninja assassin followup. But that could just be me, and has nothing to do with the game. Enjoy it, if it's for you.

Thank you - Have a nice day."
9365,For anyone wondering about length. One playthrough lasted me about 30 hours.
9366,"GTA V = 70fps
Painkiller = 600+fps
Wolfenstein The New Order = 90fps

Borderlands = 27fps

9367,best game ever!
9368,"One of my favorite FPS games of all time. Decent storyline and music. Several thousand unique gun combinations means you'll always find a better gun than the one you already have. I could definitely see Borderlands being a ""classic"" along with games like Doom in a few years."
9369,brilliant game played it on pc xbox 360 and ps3 and got all achievments for all but pc but working towards it now. great fast paced first person shooter endless possibilities no matter how many times you play each playthrough is different
9370,
9371,Very Nice :)
9372,"Dayum, this game is really crazy and awesome at the same time I loved it so much. I really recommend this game to all people out there, just try it."
9373,"Sometimes you just want to listen to a nice podcast and shoot stuff. Borderlands is that game. So turn subtitles on, put on some headphones and immerse yourself in an amazing world full of creative villains, weapons, and abilities. 5/5"
9374,"I really, really like this game."
9375,It is a good game. I have fun collecting all the loot. That and shooting things.
9376,Do Not Buy Or Play This Ugly Mess.

9379,"Borderlands is a great game that feels like if Mad Max was a video game, the characters are all fun to play with, not only is the game carzy as fuck, but has a great sense of humor aswell"
9380,There's pretty much nothing bad about this game.  An instant classic.
9381,NEVER GETS BORING
9382,Such a nice game
9383,Great game I enjoyed it
9384,"really fun game, great world setting and humor to go with it, probably best played with friends"

Achievements: 80 / 80 

— Some good humor in some spots in the game, especially in the Knoxx DLC. Wacky characters and some funny references. 

— It feels pretty satisfying to melt enemies and bosses with insane amounts of bullets. Ammo is abundant in the world, especially when you can cheat the RNG making it so you always get bullets for the weapon types you want. After a while, bullets become unnecessary if you use an Ammo Regeneration mod, making it less annoying since you don’t have to keep looting it. 

— Looting is this game’s major annoyance. Press a button to loot an item, and then repeat the process for each other item scattered on the ground. Certain enemies, like bosses, drop a ton of stuff, making it so you’ll spend most of your time in Pandora looking at the ground and looting. You can hold the loot button to execute an area loot, but the range is extremely short and you inventory is very small, meaning you’ll stop being able to loot items after half a dozen of these, at best. 

— The loot/weapon system is a mess. Weapons have a huge array of variable stats, including shooting speed, magazine ammo capacity, inventory ammo capacity, damage per bullet, bullet accuracy, bullet lag (I’ll come back to this one later) and elemental damage. The first time you play through the game, you obviously won’t have any idea of which elements are effective against each type of enemy. Making things worse, you can only equip four weapons at once (late game, 2 weapons early game), meaning you will also spend a lot of time swapping guns every time you enter a different area. No, you don’t get to use your favorite gun all of the time. It just doesn’t work. Also, seeing as your inventory is very small even after fully upgraded (by saving Claptraps) most of it will be filled with guns of various types and elements that you will need, making it so you have close to zero inventory space for loot and have to keep running back to vending machines to sell your crap. Loot rarity is also mostly non-functional, since, thanks to randomly assigned bonuses, it is possible for the crappiest low level weapon be stupidly good until 20 levels later, due to RNG. 

— Bullet lag. That’s right. Some genius at Gearbox thought it was a good idea to make each type of gun have a different bullet lag. If you shoot a medium distance object with a rifle, it will take way longer that it’s supposed to for the bullet to reach it. Even with a sniper, it’s near impossible to hit a non-stationary enemy at long distance. And forget about hitting moving targets with SMGs, unless you’re literally on their faces. What were they thinking, honestly. 

— Quick Travel is a blessing, but it’s not present in the Knoxx DLC, which by coincidence, has Kilometers of highways and makes you travel for a long time every time a mission asks you to go somewhere (very often). Also the missions tend to be repetitive and sometimes you have to kill every boss in an enemy base every time you get a mission to do anything in said base. Also, having to go through the base game twice and then going through all the DLCs to reach the level cap. Also, weird level sync where monsters are always 2-3 levels above you making them excessively hard to kill…… 

— Heavy Texture popping, especially after loadings, collision detection problems, where a small rock or piece of metal on the floor will bring you to a grinding halt, which means certain death against most bosses. 

— Most achievements involve hours of mindless grinding and some are virtually impossible unless you use exploits or design flaws. And even then the Coliseum achievements take several hours of uninterrupted play. 

— Multiplayer scaling is weird, making every enemy have several times more health, meaning that unless you and the other players are always focusing fire, each individual enemy becomes near-impossible to kill, unless you have infinite ammo or an ammo regen mod. 

So there you have it. There’s no doubt the game has a lot of problems. I haven’t found time to start on Borderlands 2 yet, but I trust many of these issues are no longer present in the sequel. That being said it was a fairly poor first attempt taking into account that we’re talking about Gearbox.

9395,Even though this game isn't as good as Borderlands 2 or Pre Suquel it's still very good. I like it

9405,Wicked Game Ever 10/10 :D
9406,"overall, this game is really good. it still holds up graphically (only on the highest settings however) and is just as good as its sequel. the guns are magnificent and the bosses and minibosses are well ballanced"
9407,"Absoulutly love it. Fantastic intro into the series that is now Borderlands.
5/5"
9408,"Played this game about 6 years after release, so a bit aged, but the graphics/animation style and gameplay aged very nicely.  I didn't do a lotta side quests, but it still took me about 30 hours to beat the main story going at a casual pace.  The variety/loot/guns are pretty well done, keeping you excited when you find a rare item or weapon.  The environments... well, I normally am not too fond of the barren wasteland type of environment, but they actually pulled it off pretty well and managed to keep me decently immersed.  This game took me about 2 or 3 hours to get into, but once I got things going I was hooked.  Some of the side quests can be a bit tedious/bland, but as long as you know when to just start pushing the main storyline again you won't ever get bored.  8/10"
9409,Great game
9410,"Good Connection with Fps and RPG. I did not try to play co- op but i will try this. For some minus it similar missions there and must go far with a legs without a vehicle in early stages in game . And some artifavcts are very god hide dont know +/- it depend. My opinion is 8,5/10"
9411,"Decided to finally get into the Borderlands franchise when this went on Steam Sale (And this wasn't included in the Handsome Collection for console). Amazing bang for the buck if you haven't gotten into Borderlands yet. I've also went on to play about 40hrs of Borderlands 2 on PS3 and am now kind of tired of it all... for now... Until the Pre-Sequel goes on sale!

Quick summary: fun shooter, cartoonish (but pretty) graphic style, decent humor and so many weapons, you'll get addicted to finding cool new ones.

The only real downside to BL1 vs BL2 is the constant backtracking and respawning of enemies.

All in all, would definitely recommend at today's price point."
9412,"Where to begin in praise of Boarderlands? This hilarious Irish comedy about three dysfunctional heros and their crazy tea-obsessed housekeeper came from nowhere to light up the gaming schedules in 1995. Then it was critically slammed but gained a viewer following right from day one, where at the start of the game Brick thought a spider baby was real.

The core quartet of characters that keep you playing - Roland himself, the Soldier; drunken and obscene Brick, Berserker; vacant Mordecai , Hunter (who hasn't done much of interest since - 'boarderlands 2' was awful); and lilth, Siren.

Too many happy moments to list here but if you haven't played this, prepare for a laugh. Life is never without incident on Craggy Island!"
9413,Shooting Jasons in a Scrapyard. And I love it.
9414,MILLIONS OF WEAPONS!
9415,"The original Borderlands. Also the best overall Borderlands game in my opinion. Despite how many critics/fans seem to claim that Borderlands 2 ""improved on the original in every way"", I can't help but COMPLETELY disagree with that notion. Yes, BL2 IS more story FOCUSED, that doesn't instantly make it better, though. Also, the original Borderlands by FAR in my honest humble opinion handled the loot system, drop rates and gun manufacturers much better than it's sequels. Yes the guns in the original Borderlands could seem similar at times. But that was made up for with the vast amount of gun types that EACH and EVERY manufacturer made (I'm looking at you BL2!!). 

See, In the original Borderlands, not ALL TORGUE weapons shoot explosive rockets, DAHL and Vladof make shotguns! TORGUE makes sniper rifles! Not ALL DAHL weapons have that ridiculous burst fire. Hyperion weapons are actually what they're supposed to be in the first place, ACCURATE! So, you see, Borderlands 2 may have flashier and more stylish and gimmicky guns, but Borderlands 1 had more practical, usable guns with actual substance! And every now and then you could find flashy weapons that had weird gimmicks like the Typhoon SMG for example, but at least it was usable half the time.

 People talk about the diversity of weapons in BL2, and I just don't see it. I'm sorry folks, but I'll take substance, usability and consistency over flashy, gimmicky guns that barely have any practical use. Also, drop rates. Borderlands 1 actually rewarded you, the player, for actually, you know, buying and playing the game. Whereas BL2 if you want to find Legendary or even just good purple guns, you have to constantly farm and spend extra money for things that you shouldn't have to if you want to get your hands on some higher quality weapons and gear. By the end of you 1st playthrough and beginning of your 2nd playthrough of Borderlands 1 you'll ACTUALLY have an appropriate amount of legendary and purple guns.

 Also, atmosphere and tone. See, something people who've started the Borderlands franchise with Borderlands 2 lack the understanding that Borderlands 1 was about a Diablo II style Action-RPG experience in a serious and bleak Sci-fi Post-Apocalyptic setting that had consistent doses of comic relief and dark humor, and most of the humor in the original stemmed from the DLCs. BL2 on the other hand, started this whole ""Everything has to be a stupid pop-culture reference, everythhing MUST have jokes constantly being rammed into your ears!!"".

 Point being here is this, if you want to find out what Borderlands is REALLY about, you must play this, the original Borderlands. As much as I've bashed the sequels, I just want to make it clear I love BL2, it's a solid game in it's own right, but it's more a completely different game to the original in tone, atmosphere, loot, character, story etc. I honestly hope Gearbox attempts to either make a remaster of the original with just graphical enhancements, or do a Borderlands sequel that actually sticks to the original style. Trust me, this game is great, and IMO THE greatest of the franchise. The original Borderlands is a special experience, so go experience it!

9417,"The First, The One, The Only"
9418,"This game caught me by surprise when I first played it. I don't know what I was expecting, but Boderlands blew me away became an instant classic in my opinion. First, the look of it is unprecedented. I hadn't played anything like it before, and the cross between cartoon and sci-fi realism was captivitating. Second, the combat is great. At it's core, it really is a true shooter, but as you progress through the game, the RPG elements give you a unique experience that allows for multiple entertaining playthroughs. Finally, the loot system is good. My only criticism is that the damage modifiers are hard to dicepher, but I encourage all players to just try guns, and see you you like them, rather than trying to read into the numbers assigned to the guns. You'll find out better what works for you and what doesn't.

The game has a great multiplayer component too. While not required for enjoying the game, I had a lot of fun playing with my friend too."
9419,"""Strip the flesh, Salt the wounds!"""
9420,"Borderlands is a really cool game to play with three of your buddies. Alone it can get pretty boring after a while but with others, it's an extremely fun cooperative experience. With ton's of high quality DLC, and some of the hardest achievement's I've seen in a long time, this makes for a great 4 pack purchase."
9421,"The first month of my/our let's play of Borderlands, it will be returning soon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-eWwVDc81I&list=PLvK-OfJKjIw6SQCyzlmQJL0z_gMzGX3LU"
9422,I love the Borderlands series. I begun Borderlands series with the 2nd game and I felt the need to see its predecessor. Not like Borderlands 2 but very close. 8/10
9423,"There are some interesting ideas in this game. I like the random gun compnents coming together to make a single weapon, unfortunately there are so many guns that the game requires you to constantly change out your weapons. That kind of makes the uniqueness of the weapons loose their flavor. The co-op is interesting and almost the only way you can play, because the world feels a bit hollow. Due to the massive leaning on the co-op the story doesn't seem important. I had to replay levels several times to try and get the story, because all my friends would complete quests, which would mostly nullify the dialog. Oftentimes when playing with other I didn't even know what they did to complete the quests. The other problem you run into is that if you are at the beginning on your game and go join a friends game and get all the way to level ___, it doesn't translate well back to your game. All those quests you completed with so and so don't count in your game. So now you find yourself overpowered to the extreme, having to find a way not to feel bored while going through the level to catch up to where you played to, and so you can get the complete story. I'm a completionists so this drove me nuts. It could be a fun game if you accept the fact that you'll probably never complete it for your character. I found myself playing through the same levels what seemed like dozens of times. In most games that would be an advantage, but since all the opponents are bullet sponges it just leaves you feeling like you're grinding in an MMO. The second game has the same problems as the first. In #2 they tightened the story up and gave the characters more banter. I do like the graphical style, with so many games trying to be ultra-realistic, this is refreshing.

I don't recommend this game to completionists, it'll drive you crazy. I also think the game would have been better suited to having weapon chassis' that had replaceable components, that you could then fill with whatever random bit you found. That would also solve the problem of playing in other peoples games when there is a large level gap and all the gear that drops is always unuseable until it's obsolete. Enemies could feel more unique if they had more specific move sets and weaknesses (they worked a bit on this in #2, but after so long you just start looking at everything as needing this gun or that). I got this game, and the second, to play with friends and I have around 400 hours between the two, regardless what steam says (seriously when are they going fix that - I have games that I haven't even played yet that say I have hundreds of hours in). I will only play it with friends and I get bored of it after and hour or two. You've been warned."
9424,The game combines the play of an RPG with the action of an FPS so well. The whole game is open world and you can kill to your hearts content. I love this game and can't wait to get the next couple of games!!!
9425,"I really love borderlands. I'd say its one of my favorite games of all time. The way the story is and how fun it can get, its a perfect game! Spite what it says my time is, I played about over 100 hours on my onlive acount before i switched to playing it here. The game flows very well and there are so many diffrent wepons to choose from. Not to mention that the DLC's add a ton of extra fun to add onto it. The only thing I had a problem with was the fact that the world always seems empty - and i get that, that is the set up of borderlands and that it makes it, but it can make or break the experience. I really think that anyone who likes FPS should buy this game. Its worth the price! 100/10"
9426,Still one of my all time favorite games! Hours and hours and hours of fun and replayability!!
9427,"Honstly I've had so many issues running this game. It would force restart my system. It would lag. Finally as of last night all the data for my lvl 40 character became currupted. The game itself is fun. The issues are not. Bad port,maybe."
9428,borderlands is a great game to play on your own or with friends. there are many hours of fun to be had playing this game as the playability is huge so anyone who does not have this game you should get it and encourage friends to as well 10/10 great game.
9429,"ur just a average kid and u get sucke into a comic book world filled with villains and aliens






i would reckemend this game to any cool cat that likes comic books and super heros like me"
9430,BEST GAME
9431,"Unapoligetically graceless, bitingly funny, and twistedly brutal.  A Diablo style loot mechanic combined with FPS game play and expansive world design.  An engaging game that creates a wonderfull space to play alone or in a group and doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is.  In its own dark humor fashion it's an apt metaphore for gaming culture as a whole.  

8.5/10"
9432,"This game is still the best in the series! soo many guns, crazy action and just hours of fun. Only down side is the lack of story but the rest of the game makes up for that."
9433,"The original and best so far, Love this game.  The DLC's feel like additional quests rather than more of the same (a failing in Borderlands 2 and the pre-sequel.)  If you make a borderlands 3/4 please follow this model.
Thank you"

9436,"What a great way to start a series that everygame after would still be great. Many aspects about this game make it very fun but to save time I'll make a list. 
Pros. -Gameplay (while a tad bit stale) is fun and makes great use of the constant changing of
guns you can use.
-Classes are different and trees are short but efficient (story of my life)
-Loot, loot everywhere.
Cons. -Story is very bland
-Environments consist of sand, sand, and OH LOOK more sand.
-Game does get boring if exposed to for a extended period of time (but I have no life so that might not be an issue for some)
-Animation on enemies is... strange.
But overall, the game is a lot of fun and I still enjoy ALL of the sand that the game has. 8/10"
9437,"I first played this game a long while back.  Playing as Brick the berserker was moderately amusing and had my co-op buddies laughing hysterically as I punched stuff to death, but the game seemed primitive, colorless, and repetitive.  I didn't stick with it long.

So time passed and my co-op buddies got me to play Borderlands 2.  I wasn't exactly excited about it but I humored them and went in with my Borderlands 1 experience coloring my view.  And if you're expecting to not like something, and don't really want to like it, you probably won't like it.  I played BL2 for a couple hours with them and put it aside, and quite honestly forgot about it.  

Well, for some reason I got hungry for an FPS and remembered I had Borderlands 2 installed.  So I figured I'd give it another shot, try another class and run solo for a bit to get to know the game.  And I fell in love with it.  I fell so hard I eventually came back to Borderlands 1 to give it another go and see if it just wasn't bad attitude keeping me from enjoying it.  Nope.  Comparing Borderlands to Borderlands 2 is like comparing Pong to Portal.  I got far enough in to recognize a few landmarks when they showed up in BL2 and that was as much as I could take.  

So to sum up, save yourself some time and just go straight to Borderlands 2.  Maybe catch a YouTube video for some BL1 backstory.  The only good thing about Borderlands 1 is that its existence made Borderlands 2 possible."
9438,"Very great game! While BL2 improves over BL1, I feel that BL1 is a bit more satisfying. I will still plan to play this game 15 years from now."
9439,10/10
9440,This game is soo much fun  and i dont normally like shooter games cause i cant shhot for shyte but this is soo much different.. i also have borderlands 2 and when the time comes i be getting the presequal as well  and all the dlc's lol  they all have a fantastic stroyline and the the dlc's content is like a game in itself with fantastic storylines and well everything
9441,"I am forced to either recommend or not recommend a game when writing a review. Fine. Not recommended. However, I have a neutral stance when it comes to this game. I can neither recommend nor discourage purchasing this game. 

I finally got around to getting into this franchise this past winter, and was pleasantly surprised by just how much fun it was. Co-op was ok to good. Game mechanics were actually pretty good. However, the respawn rate can make the game a little too grindy - even if you play with a friend. Nonetheless, I had fun.

So. Why am I not recommending Borderlands? I don't recall ever becoming so disenchanted so quickly with a game on the basis of just how much better the sequels are (including the much maligned TPS). After playing The Pre-Sequel and starting Borderlands 2, I have zero desire to go back and play the original Borderlands. Almost every aspect of the original seems very klunky compared to Borderlands 2 and TPS. Thus, even though I have a portion of the last Borderlands DLC left to complete, I doubt I ever will. Oh!  And I usually want to try each character class in this sort of game. Not so this time. 

Borderlands is worth playing to experience the storyline first hand, but only once in my opinion. However, if story doesn't matter to you, you can probably skip ahead to either The Pre-Sequel or to Borderlands 2. I do like games with a tale to tell, and this aspect of the game appealed to me. The DLC is fine, but might be hit or miss on the basis of theme. Read the description of each before blindly buying. Just be sure you are completely done with Borderlands before playing any of the sequels. As I've said, there is just no going back. 

Deeply discounted, this game is a good buy. It is also good enough to give you a relatively inexpensive taste of the Borderlands series; and, if you like what you see, it is a fine appetizer."
9442,Its more of a tech demo for the other two Borderland games.  Also I hate too much DLC.
9443,"If you have friends to play with its a wonderful game, full of replayability. And tons of great DLC to keep you playing for quite a long time."
9444,It is awesome liek all Borderlands Games
9445,Buyyyy it its my favorite game (the low playtimeis because i played it on another account)
9446,Old gaem.
9447,Great game would recommend buying all of them
9448,"i love killing things. i love humor and sarcasm. i love this game.

Make sure to buy the game of the year edition.

strip the flesh.

salt the wound."
9449,nice game
9450,"So fun back in the day.  Playing with a friend is a million times more fun than playing alone.  The newer iterations are better however, and you do not need to play through the games chronologically.  The story isn't THAT in depth."
9451,"This is a pretty incredible game, but cowers in the face of it's successor, Borderlands 2. The storyline of this game is not necessary to the plot of Borderlands 2. 

I really would love to play this so I could understand all the references in Borderlands 2, but I despise these old 2009 graphics and would absolutely ADORE a remake with Borderlands 2's more recent graphics."
9452,good
9453,"When you find a rocket launcher that fires 6 shots simultaneously and cause fps lag for the friends, Priceless.
When you steal both cars leaving your friends to walk, Priceless.
When you leave a friend to die because they took the best loot, Priceless. (For you anyway)
There are some things money can't buy, but for everything else, you can open that vault with the riches in it.
Of course, you'll need to buy this game first."
9454,"Borderlands. This game is just amazing. The graphics style is immediately eye-catching and completely new to the gaming scene, with its bold outlines and graphic, yet comic, design. The storyline, ugh, it just cannot get any better. Again, comical, but such a new approach to the shooter genre; four Vault-Hunters (i.e. treasure hunters) arrive on Pandora to seek out a hidden alien treasure stash full of loot said to be somewhere on the planet. Even once you manage to conquer this storytelling-masterpiece of a campaign, there are double the amount of side-missions provided to you, as well as weapon-, location-, and character-specific challenges that double the time required to fully 'complete' the game. And even after THAT, there are four quite well-made DLCs on offer that add quite a bit of content to the game, both story- and gameplay-wise. Paired with fantastically hilarious and developed characters with crudely witty dialogue, single-player couldn't be more dense and enjoyable.

Never has there been such a satisfying loot system. There are quite literally millions of different weapons you could come across, whether through a shop, chests placed throughout the surprisingly-beautiful landscapes, or lucky drops from enemies. Finding a weapon that improves upon one you already have provides its own feeling of excitement, and yet each upgrade leaves you wanting more. You've got your standard groups of guns, being shotguns, assault rifles, SMGs, sniper rifles, pistols/revolvers, and rocket launchers. But yet again, the developers prove that their imaginations are off the charts. Unfortunately, many guns are, visually, re-skins of others of the same type, but you will never find two indentical weapons. With elemental options (Incendiary, Corrosive, Shock, and Explosive), there are approaches available to each situation for every single player.

Certainly, Gearbox and 2K have nearly perfected the co-op system, because, impossibly, the single-player gameplay improves, by becoming even more bloody, challenging, and full of loot with a mate or two, or even three. Enemies get tougher, loot becomes more valuable and plentiful, and the XP comes flying in faster than ever. If you and your friends have been looking for a game to play side by side, look no further.

Like the guns, enemies MAY become boring to the eye, as it becomes the same groups of enemies you must fight through every mission, and they, for the most part, look identical. The HUD is, again, unique, but somewhat clunky, as are the main and inventory menus. Honestly, though, the downsides end there. Borderlands may not be the first RPG FPS, but it is certainly one of the best."
9455,love this game

9465,A great game.
9466,I punched a robot and it gave me loot. 10/10 would play again
9467,"When I have a bad day and feel like I need to kill things, any one of the Borderlands series is my go to. It's a fantastic game, with incredible replay value, I LOVE co-op games so if you have friends it's even better because there's stronger enemies and more loot to wootloot. All the different characters are awesome although in this one Lilith is my most commonly picked one."
9468,"I don't think it would be possible for me to say anything bad about this game. I'm on my second playthrough with my first character, and I'll probably play through at least once with each of the other classes."
9469,"A great game as everyone knows.   A decentish PC port, but is missing an FOV slider although this can be set in the INI filles , the default FOV is really bad for a PC game.

I recommend this one over the newer Borderlands games, as this game feels more complete and less mainstream.  It feels like its own game."
9470,If youre a fan of TES games I think youll easily like Borderlands.
9471,"dude

9472,amazing game.
9473,"this is the most awsomest game ever
"
9474,"One of the craziest, most enjoyable games I've ever played, accompanied with a massive assortment of weapons and a masterfully fitted soundtrack, made 10x better by the fact claptrap isn't nearly as annoying as he is in the second game, and even then he's trying to help you by reminding you about sidequests (not wallsphincters)"
9475,"This game is alot of get guns kill things get bigger guns kill bigger things, but it truly is loads of fun to play. It has a great sense of humor, it has tons of enemies, way more guns then there are in every COD game combined, lots of side stuff to keep you interested, and the cartoony art style is a nice break from all the gritty next gen super realistic stuff. There's also alot of strategy involved because you can only carry so many guns/items at one time."
9476,Built with player 1 in mind
9477,Get the updated version instead.
9478,"Very fun game. Nice variety of enemies. and the skill trees give you alot of different ways to play your character. 
Only problems are that the game takes you on a kinda linear path of the open world thats provided, and the settings are really really brown until the end levels.

Those two things really dont take away anything from this interesting world and enjoyable shooter."
9479,"This was a fun game in 2009. Just play Borderlands 2 now, next to no lore carries over, it's safe."
9480,"This game is incredibly bland and lifeless. The gun variety, loot mechanics and action can be quite satisfying at times but you'll be shocked at how empty the world feels, it's just depressing. Considereing it has next to no story, the humor in the game is the only thing remotely close to tugging your emotions.

 Not much enemy variety, repeated use for friendly NPC models makes the game seem rushed. The enemy respawning mechanic is extremely irritating and unforgiving ESPECIALLY at the beginning of the game. Seriously, you'll fight hard and strategically to clear an enemy hideout, then minutes later, all of those enemies you worked hard to kill respawn right behind you, it's complete BS, like they didn't even test it.  This game became such a drag I only compelted it so I'd never feel like playing it again. I honestly  wouldn't play this game again for 100 bucks, just no.

The sequel is far, let me repeat, FAAAAAAAAAAAAAR superior. It fixes problems from this game that you didn't even know existed and more. More colorful graphics, superior humor, WAAAAAY better story, more engaging action. I assure you, Borderlands 2 is actually worth your time, I highly recommend it. This game however, just doesn't cut it."
9481,this game is a awesome game with lots of dlc and content the one problem for me is the graphics but otherwise it would get a 5 star review
9482,"GAME IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
9483,"Best game ever
But if you play solo its a bit bored atleast if you have 1 friend with different classes helping each other out its awesome"
9484,You can shoot midgets and shit 12/10
9485,"for reasons
"
9486,"I enjoyed this game very much, and continue to enjoy it now! There are a few small gameplay issues here and there, but those have largely been eliminated in BL2 it seems.

The two things that had the biggest impact on me were the music, and the bleak undertone of the environment. There are tracks that give a melancholy feeling, and some that are downright unnerving (such as when entering a cave or abandoned building). I love it! Also, I couldn't help but notice details that, despite the somewhat cartoonish stylization of the game's aesthetic, made me realize how dark many things were. Dr. Tannis losing her mind, many of the denizens having lost loved ones, the faceless corporations endlessly sweeping the galazy for resources, and so on. Really really great stuff when you take a good look at the big picture."
9487,"Great graphics and gameplay, but the storyline is a bit linear and basic."
9488,This is a good game and it is very fun. It has lots of funny jokes and is realy made well. It has good gaphics and the engine it uses is great.
9489,"The amount of tim tam biscuits i can fit in my mouth is outstanding, i really like to do arts and crafts and i like the occasional cup of tea.
i enjoy water spots and long walks with no pants on.
11/10 would fap again"
9490,gud
9491,"Fast, fun, and unapologetically crass, this is the best game I’ve played in a long time, and is truly deserving of the moniker “role-playing shooter.” I very much recommend buying this... Borderlands may be a relatively simple mix of shooter action and RPG elements, however, it will mainly appeal to shooter fans rather than those looking for an immersive roleplaying experience."
9492,"Dont be fooled by my incredibily low play time. I have played this game on Xbox before I got it on Steam and I have about 1100 hours of fun in game. Everyone needs to play this game at least once in their life. Completely recommend it. Spoiler: [spoiler] Btw, IF you go sniper path on Hunter, you are OP [/spoiler]"
9493,"An addictive combination of FPS and RPG, 'Borderlands' will have you traversing map after map completing quests, challenges and progressing the story. You can do this alone, or with friends. The story is good but not exceptional, and some of the characters are truly memorable. The gameplay is smooth and satisfying with a gear system and special skills available for each class, and one can expect to get about ~18-20 hours of gameplay out of it before you have tried everything. The graphics take on a comic-style, which works efficiently in creating a specific art style that adds to its comedic humour.

A good FPS-RPG that will keep you satisfied, but won't leave you awed."
9494,"As the first title in an all-new sci-fi action franchise, Borderlands combines the best elements of Gearbox Software's first-person action titles with player customization and vehicular combat. Borderlands features a unique content generation system allowing for near-endless variety in missions, environments, enemies, weapons, item drops and character customization. Borderlands is a cooperative experience, allowing for multiple players to share the same game experience simultaneously online. Players can freely join or leave each other’s games at anytime, or choose to play in the full single-player mode. Borderlands features life-like character animations, impressive real-time physics, and customizable vehicles"
9495,Hello Vault Hunter! This is an excellent game for a reasonable price - although near the end claptrap spams the mic. its pretty good and i suggest playng the whole series!
9496,"What can I say about this game? It's definetly worth buying, lots of humor (claptrap is the boss), nice comic graphics and huge replayability value. Recently gamespy died but steam took over the game and its back to life! The game offers: tons of loot, fun, shooting, crazy stuff, good story, full coop mode up to 4 people in a squad.
Do you want to know more?
Buy the game and see it for yourself, its definetly worth it (GOTY Edition)"
9497,Timeless.
9498,Great game and the start of the borderlands series but at this point you would probably be better off getting 2 or pre sequal. Only play this now if you are true borderlands fan and can't get enough.

Borderlands 2, Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, BulletStorm, & Serious Sam 2

[b][u]Summary[/u][/b]
Loot frenzy FPS game with a comic book art style and its own brand of goofy humor. You are a vault hunter sent to the planet to uncover the mystery of the vault. You are sent on a variety of tasks in hopes to uncover the mystery throughout the course of the game. The game excels at constantly giving you ammo and new combinations of different guns. You will choose between four different classes of vault hunter.

[b][u]The Good[/u][/b]
The gun variety is virtually unmatched even by the Borderlands games that came after it. Each class has a distinct feel to it. The humor is great. The characters are fun and fully capable of carrying the series on for a long time. Leveling up is rewarding.

[b][u]The Bad[/u][/b]
The game starts off enjoyable, but around level 10 I begain to feel extremely bored with the area I was in. I pushed through and things turned around at level 20. The reason for the boredom was the extreme lack of different environments and enemies. I also was falling victim to the games main problem with its gun system. I had not found a single weapon capable of taking enemies down in a timely manner. To defend the system I will say it is nice to be able to use the same gun for more than 10 levels especially if they are uniques. The new games fix the not finding a descent gun problem, but replace it with a system where your gun is replaced every few levels. The lack of new environments is better in later levels, but it never quite feels different enough. The later level enemy variety is pretty good even though you'll be fighting bandits for almost the entire game to an extent. The story will leave you wondering if the game is actually over because of the total lack of explaining anything at the end.

[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]
The story in the game is the most lacking factor. This game oozes style and humor in the best of ways. Though this game doesn't have near as many character interactions as the second game. That lack of opportunity to have group humor makes it a less enjoyable game then the second in the series. That being said once you get past level 20 the game opens up nicely. The best DLC is Knoxx with Clap Traps Robot Army coming in a slightly distant second. The Zombie DLC is very basic and the other DLC is just an arena mini game. Overall there is plenty of content to enjoy here. 

[b][u]Value[/u][/b]
Though the game offers a lot of content I would value it around $10 due to the lack of variety and character interactions."

9501,"Great and fun game, played around the main game with Brick which was tons of crazy berserking fun. Sunk 40+ hours into it as of now having played the main quest and Underdome, and still got all the other DLC to go.
Great characters, good voice acting, and creepy freaky bosses :) 
I have yet to see a crash or bug in this game, and the few instances of clipping into walls were mere nuisances.

9502,"The good news is, I played this game and enjoyed it.
The bad news....I played this AFTER I played Borderlands 2.
Why, you may ask? Well, I was always interested in Borderlands but never got around to picking it up. Then I saw Chloe Dykstra's Gague cosplay on TV once and she seemed to have so much fun with it that I decided to try the game. It was a blast but I missed out on a lot of the little story bits that carried over. So, eventually, I picked up and played Borderlands and while it was fun and well worth my time....BL2 had added so many improvements that it really did feel like a big step back. That'll learn me, eh?"

9512,I just started replaying this game after quite some time.  I'm enjoying it more this time around than I did when it came out.  Definitely worth having and gives lots of play time.
9513,"It's a Fun game, Lots to do."
9514,"While it is an older game now, this game is definitely notable because it makes a hybrid out of FPS games with hack and slash character progression levelling abilities along with gearing that one finds in the older hack and slash adventure  games (that some people mistakenly label as RPGs (i.e. Diablo).  While not the first game to offer levling of FPS charcaters (Hexen 2 for instance), it does a great job of making it have the depth noting all the adventures and DLC with a +1 mode.  Graphics use a toonish style yet works noting the lighting and surreal landscapes.  Throw in the MadMax/Road Warrior/Firefly/Apocalyptic themes, and you have a decent game.  It should be noted that the next two in this series have Linux/Mac ports.  Humor is average in its adolescent scope.  Fun sit down for friends."

I'm aware I've missed out on a lot of titles but I'm so happy to have been introduced to Borderlands. This game is amazing and don't let the release date fool you into thinking it's not. It has hours and hours of gameplay enjoyment and it will not get old easily. What's even better than that is the dlc which not only adds more hours to the gameplay but acts like an extended new story all on it's on as well. So if you ever see this on sale which tends to happen occassionally.. don't hesitate because you will have a great time.

[h1]Positives:[/h1]

Didn't get far enough in the game to discuss any.

[h1]Negatives:[/h1]

- The field of view (FOV) is truly disastrous, it's like a nightmare. It was immediately noticeable from the moment the game started. This FOV hurts your eyes and leaves you somewhat dazed and confused. You can't focus on the screen or characters properly. It's a very valid reason to discontinue playing. In addition, any fix for this doesn't work properly, at least in my experience. Editing the willow.ini file either produces no results or isn't a good solution because the FOV resets everytime you sprint or look down a gun scope anyway.
- Borderlands literally plays like a title out of the late 1990s, where enemies shuffle around strangely, back and forth, as if to dodge bullets. Funnily, it sorta reminds me of the very early 3D FPS titles like Wolfenstein. I consider myself a good FPS player, but even I found it difficult to headshot the AI.
- The audio is not clear like every other game I've played (even Borderlands 2), despite having audio effects turned up to the highest setting. For example, gun rounds sound really dull and Claptrap's voice is very low in pitch - these observations came from the first 30 minutes of gameplay, so obviously it's rampant throughout.

Overall score: 3/10

Borderlands is an extremely poor console port, a supremely lazy effort by the developers who couldn't be bothered doing the very basics right for the PC platform. Definitely not worth even $10 on sale. It goes to show, it doesn't matter if you have the most fantastic game in the world, if you haven't designed it well for PC, people aren't going to enjoy it. For now I can't bring myself to play Borderlands any more than a few hours due to the horrific FOV. Maybe in the future i'll return to it."
9521,"This game shoot,kill,shoot,kill."

Do you like rednecks? Midgets? Psychotic people? How about the color brown?


Do you really like to shoot things too?



In that case, have I got a game for you.


The pinnacle of almost-good games, and winner of over a hundred ""Best Sand of the Year"" awards! Borderlands!



What else could combine all the great aspects of rednecks and sand quite like Borderlands? And not only that, it's a pretty decent co-op FPS-RPG. Imagine your favorite shooting game, but when you shoot things numbers fly out. Yup, that's Borderlands. It takes all of your favorite RPG elements and incorporates them into a shooty-killy. Now there's numbers, fetch quests, you gotta level up, fetch quests, kill thing quests, fetch quests. Oh yeah, and midgets.


There's a great treasure somewhere on the brownest planet in the galaxy, and it's up to you to find it. Do you have what it takes to run back and forth across an alien wasteland over and over?



There's a lot done right in Borderlands. And a lot done wrong. Quite a bit done wrong, actually.



There's a lot of sand in this game.




Borderlands is a very special kind of game.


At its best points, it's an incredibly addictive shooter with an interesting loot system. Get your mission from a redneck that wants you to fix something that's wrecked ""as bad as his momma's girl parts"". Go out into the desert, shoot a bunch of vagina-face alien dogs. Blast its face off, and watch as a magical rainbow of lights explodes from the bloody stump where its head was. The lights are new guns that have appeared like magic, and you get to take all of them. Maybe one has bullets that explode on contact. Maybe one will melt faces off. Maybe one has a funny name. There's all kinds.


You'll go back and get your reward for completing your mission, use your newly earned cash to buy some new equipment, maybe level up. Learn to melt faces with your hands or something.



But as you set off on your next mission, you'll find that it's more of the same. Different part of the desert, different things to shoot, different redneck to help. But ultimately the same as what you'd already done.


The desert never goes anywhere. You might find a cave, or a run-down building to explore. But there's never anything except brown. Which is actually pretty sad.



Using a lot of browns and greys is incredibly common for your average AAA shooter. But none of those have the level of style and charm that Borderlands does.


Borderlands is a heavily stylized, charming game. The graphics are beautiful, at least until you realize that they're the only graphics in the whole game.


The world that it fleshes out looks like a massive brown turd, but it's the prettiest and most stylish turd you've ever seen.


It's a shame that an art style so good is wasted on the repetitive and dull world that you're given. Not to mention how often you'll need to run back and forth across said lifeless desert.



At points, the map is so big that you'll NEED a vehicle. Which IS usually provided. But if it gets blown up mid-quest, you'll be stranded in the middle of nowhere with a very long and dull trek back to civilization.


And getting stranded is gonna be a really common thing too, with how often you'll be running back and forth for the near endless amount of fetch quests.


Borderlands got a few things right with the RPG mechanics. You have different classes to choose from, each with a couple different skill trees to develop. And the loot system is incredibly fun, and yet a little poorly balanced. I kept one specific gun throughout much of the game just because it could just kill things faster than most higher level guns. It's easy to find one really good gun amongst a ton of crappy common guns and just keep it even while underleveled. Most of the loot you usually get is absolute trash, but it's still fun to pick up a bunch of guns and look through them for anything better than what you have.


Guns can have quite a bit of features to differentiate them. Different scopes, fire rates, reload times, even elemental powers. You can have a shotgun that causes things to burst in flames. Or a machine gun that melts things with acid.


These are some of the things that make Borderlands such an almost-good game.


And then there's all of those things that make it such an almost-bad game. Like repetitive quests that take place in visually identical areas that are supposed to be different.



If there's anything that can redeem it for its poorly executed take on a great concept, its definitely the game's general style and sense of humor.


Dialogue is never dull. Characters are always interesting. The humor, while often incredibly dark or raunchy, is always bountiful. The plot itself isn't anything special in the slightest, and is more predictable than watching bread. But at least the journey is decently entertaining.



If you can immerse yourself in the world of Borderlands, you might just be able to enjoy it. Its co-op features are pretty nice, allowing you to tackle missions together. And having friends always makes games better. The amount of content here is pretty massive, and the DLC packs also add even more to it. Including trees!


You really shouldn't have to pay extra to have trees in your games. But still, you can get a crazy circus stripper too. Who doesn't want more of those in their games? Those are worth paying extra for.



Like I said, it's an almost-good game, and an almost-bad game. At the same time. It definitely has its moments, but those moments could've been executed a lot better.



It's a game about rednecks and sand.



If you can be fine with a game about rednecks and sand, I think you'll be just fine."
9526,"Most fun I've ever had hunting a vault. Loved the Armory and Underdome DLC, totally worth the money. The giant vagina monster near the end gets a 'not sure if want' sticker. All the awards for dialogue writing and level design -- the painted-on feel of Borderlands makes even endless mountains and rocks not look boring (as opposed to games where you can spot a 512x512 repeating texture miles away). Never did get around to beating Crawmerax..."
9527,"This game is:
Awesome
Hilarious
Fun

This game has:
RPG elements
Co-op

More guns

OMG THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME ON A SCALE OF 1 TO EVEN I CAN'T
1/even"
9528,"Fun game if a bit dated graphics-wise. Good mix of FPS Action and RPG Character Building, with a healthy dose of crude humor. Definitely worth getting, but only if it's on sale, otherwise look to the newer titles in the series."
9529,Amazing! 10/10
9530,"LOVE this game. Had it on console and 100% completed it but I still just had to have it on Steam too. Well worth the price with hours of gameplay and replay value..

10/10 would recommend."
9531,YASS
9532,"Okay, it's 2015 and my first time with Borderlands (I've played the second one some time ago). 

Over 4 hours in and I'm still in the first location doing mindless fetch quests. After dealing with poor PC port problems like low FOV, mouse acceleration, useless interface, and many more I started to acually play the game. Unfortunately for and RPG there is too little character development and an almost absent story. For an FPS the gunplay is just atrocious and the combat feels all over the place.

Keep in mind that I played alone because the online component seems dead.

TL;DR
- Poor optimalisation (fov, controls, UI)
- poor combat mechanics
- poor RPG elements (no story, character customisation very weak)
- empty, boring world 
- repetitive and boring, boring, boring.
- did I say boring?

Save your money and buy something else. It doesn't live up to it's reputation. Too bad that this review will drown in a sea of positives that were written on a wave of hype."
9533,i got to kick my friend's ass in a duel 10/10
9534,I bought this game on a whim for the ps3 and instantly fell in love with it. I have since beaten it completely through with all the DLC. then preorderd the second and the pre-sequel. the second I have beaten even more times then the first but I'm looking forward to getting back to the first. when I saw the gfames on sale I couldn't pass it up and I highly doubt I will regret it.
9535,"NYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
*Rubs Nips*"
9536,Co-op split screen is hell. Get your own screen mofo!
9537,"This game is amazingly fun.  The plot barely exists, but the gunplay is so great you wont even worry.

My favourite part is, of course, the loot system.  The RPG elements in this game make it feel akin to a lighter version of Skyrim, but the loot system is what hooks you.  Instead of starting off the game with all options in front of you and slowly narrowing your playstyle throughout the game, you are at the mercy of what guns you can find.  If you find an amazing shotgun but haven't found that highly accurate sniper you've wanted, you had better learn to use shotguns in the meantime.  This creates very diverse gameplay, where you're always learning how your unique weapons work and adapt your fighting style on the go.  By the end you will have proficiencies with the weapons you liked the most, and will most likely have powerful weapons in that class, but there is always a chance of finding a super rare, super powerful gun of a class  you've yet to use.

If you're looking for the story to be anything but a general compass showing which area has similarly levelled enemies, you will not find it here.  In the end, this game is to be played for the great gameplay and the excitement of finding rare loot.  But that is more than enough to keep you hooked on multiple playthroughs."
9538,"Borderlands the Iconic game that started it all!
While this game did lead to borderlands 2 it isn't all that fun... Like with the first assasins creed the controls are clucky and not very smooth.
Its a cartoony style First person shooter with quite alot of funny stuff to keep you entertained as you stroll around killing everything that is susceptible to damage.
With all the guns you will be constantly changing weapons and picking through loot!
While the plot is intresting its not worth the uncomfortable gameplay or atleast not for me.
If you want something to play with your friends buy Borderlands 2 or The Pre-Sequel as they are just more fun."
9539,I find this the best concieved of the three Borderlands games offered even though it is the oldest.  Money well spent for leisure time activity. Five stars
9540,"This game is not bad to play, good graphics though and the gameplay is not atrocious when i start it up and play."
9541,kewl
9542,"This game was my childhood, i used to go to my friends house and we'd beat it in one session, we stayed up all night of course, but we would play this game to no end. 
10/10 Would share personal memories again."
9543,dis is sick game
9544,The first is better than the second
9545,Kill. Loot. Kill. Loot.
9546,"A wonderful game. I came here from Borderlands 2, and I have to say:
Borderlands is even better. You can find guns in the red chests, 5 levels under yours, but still better.
The amount of loot is to great to comprehend and so is the fun you have while playing this game.
Buy it."
9547,"fun to play with friends, just started recently but so far so good :3"
9548,"Borderlands is pretty fun to play. You're just a vault hunter (mercenary) that runs around this wasteland of a planet doing missions for people while slowly working towards getting parts of a key that will open one of the planet's fabled vaults, which are filled with treasures and weapons. This game doesn't try to overload you with too much story, and you don't really have a reoccurring nemesis through the game.

The gunplay is solid, upgrading your character for your playstyle is also cool and I liked that you can reset the points you have assigned in case you want to change it up. Borderlands is a fun shooter and a great basis for the later games to refine and improve on."
9549,"It's a decent time with friends, but it's not all it's hyped up to be.
Due to the way this game's leveling system works, you essentially HAVE to play with your friends the whole way through, otherwise the balance of the game will be off.

The whole loot system is a big aspect of the game but it's a bit messier than it has to be.

I guess if that's what you're into though it's more of a plus on you. I was pretty unimpressed.

So yeah, fun distraction with friends. All in all though, far from brilliant."
9550,"Awesome shooter , fast , furious, insane ...  Laughable head-shots.  Highly recommended."
9551,"Borderlands is a good game. Check out my pros and cons below.

Pros;
Simple and easy controls 
Easy to master
Long campaign
Funny characters
Tonnes of interesting weapons to play around with
A confusing plot that will make you hooked 
Difficult AI make it challenging
Something a little bit different 


Cons;
All missions are essentially the same (go here and kill this guy/collect this then return to me for your reward) 
Not much replay value
Some characters are very annoying
DLC isn't that good (some of them are okay)
Vehicles are slow


All in all I would say that this is a good game, but not great. It has certainly given me hours of fun, looking forward to playing borderlands 2. 
"
9552,Much fun. DLCs worthwhile so get the Game of the Year version.
9553,"The game is totally insane, it will drive you mad at points, but the replayability is built in.  The expansions to this game are unreal, you really need to pick it up just for the fun of it.  I work in a highly technical environment, and one theing peopel that are very techy oriented seem to not be able to talk enough about it BOARDERLANDS.  I seriously recommend to have a good sense of humor, understand this is a game, make it fun for other as other I am very certain will make it fun for you."
9554,"The game is a bit unbalanced in terms of difficulty and also the checkpoint system in the game is a bit frustrating and can make you replay sections which can take up to an hour. However the gunplay is still very good, the story gives you enough context to want to keep playing and the game is still fun especially with friends. The PC port isn't too good with random frame drops and a lack of field of view options, however the game can be modded to include those features. It is not as good as the sequal, however it is still fun and will keep you busy for a long time.

+ Fun levels
+ Colourful graphics
+ Solid gunplay
- Port could be better
- Slow paced and unbalanced at times"
9555,Brilliant.  I never thought I'd ask for a Mac port though
9556,"RPG+FPS... = Pure Badassery...

Borderlands is so freaking fun! The combination of both and RPG and a First Person Shooter is something that I always love, and by god, the Borderlands series is right on point when it comes to doing it. Sure, it may seem alittle easy, but with the DLC's, such as The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, things can get a little hectic. All and all, great game, funny and enjoyable characters (mainly CLPTRP), and a crap load of guns to freaking choose from!

10 outa 10!"

9562,"One of my favorite games of all time, and mind you thats quite a few."
9563,ye
9564,"Not fun.  I tried this game out after playing Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel thinking that it was probably like BL2 but with worse graphics.  It was worse everything.  

While gameplay mechanics seem like they would be the same, but the game space is way worse.  Annoying enemies constantly respawn and rather than being a challenge they just grate on my nerves.  I'm not even level 10 and I don't feel like forcing myself to play a game that should be about fun.  

It could be argued that this is the first game of the franchise and gearbox was still learning how to make an open world RPG/FPS game.  I'm just glad I never bought this at full retail in 2009.  I really wanted to play the game so I could see the story set before the Pre-sequel and maybe find out more about the vault-hunter NPC's in BL2, but Borderlands 1 is so bad that I just can't keep playing it."
9565,"This game is really quite mediocre, terrible loot tables, repetative gameplay etc.."
9566,"Never paid any attention to this game when it first came out; judged it by the box art. Finally bought it on a whim the other day because it was on sale for $7.50. I figured what the hell; even if it sucks I'm only out seven bucks and some change. I installed it, started playing and was amazed. I'm still only a few hours in to it, but I have to say the  gameplay, story and graphics are excellent. Borderlands is like an ARPG and a first person shooter had a baby.
Best of all, since my computer is only mid-range, I can run this with all the bells and whistles, and everything maxed out.
Yeah, I'm a few years late to the party, but now I see what all the excitement was about. I heartily recommend this game. If you're like me and never played it, get this game! If you like ARPGS and shooters, you will like Borderlands.."
9567,"Absolutely hilarious game with so much to do, not even nearly completed the game yet and I can tell you it's worth the buy. Especially if you can grab the GOTY edition with the DLC. Enjoy."
9568,<3 Love this game it great
9569,"I have played this game for less than 10 hours.

I am quite certain I will play it for another 40, or however long it takes to do everything.

Making people's heads explode by shooting them with an electrified space revolver is fun.

Gunning down hordes of flying alien bird-raptors with an assault rifle is also fun.

Finding rare loot and making people know about it is more fun.

Finding a rocket launcher feels like you just high-fived god.

Play this game. It's gritty, it's funny, it's dark, it's bloody, it's a goddamned riot in a bottle.

I lament only one thing: That there is no HELL FUCKING YES"" option when recommending this game."
9570,"it's a good game, I love console games and I recently switch to PC, played Borderlands 2 on playstations 3 before the first, since I randomly caught this on sale game of the year edition, I enjoyed myself playing it, and I definitly recommend it, gets more intresting with friends."

[2020 revised review]: Great game, play it before BL2, but it is true, BL2 is better. Fun characters, story, map design, everything about it is enjoyable."
9575,very fun game if you like killing things and getting cool shit for it this is the game for you
9576,"I can't really recommend this game. Story is almost non-existent, narration is poor, it's extremely boring in longer sessions or when side questing too much. Not enough voice overs (Come on, they could have at least made cut scenes / vo for the main story). Entire game is just about running around and exploring and grinding. Oh wait, you can pass on exploring because there aren't even any nice rewards for it - no lore pieces or cool gear (except for the randomly generated guns) The only goal - the secret vault. Gameplay? Running around and shooting endless waves of bandit and and some limited wildlife. BORING. The only loot you get here is guns. guns guns guns guns guns with 90% of them being useless. Geee.... Sorry, can't recommend. 

After a couple of hours I only was doing just enough side quests to get exp to progress through main story because I was actually curious of what's in the vault. Otherwise there is absolutely no satisfaction in simply retarded gunning and running everything that moves.

Oh, do I need to say that 99.5% of the quests are a generic MMO ""go kill x y times"" that aren't even voiced. 

I do not understand the phenomenon of this game. If borderlands 2 is the same I'll pass. This just feels like one giant copy-paste over and over with a system that randomly generates you new guns . 

Well, some people are into it! I was also told that this is more of a co-op game to enjoy with others. I'll see how it fares as a multiplayer."
9577,"Игрушка не плохая, даже весёлая 10/10"
9578,"What it lacks in story, it makes up for all the badass things you can do. Although the quests get repetitive at some point though, glad they (somewhat) addressed this on the sequels :)"
9579,"I have no idea how I managed to finish this game solo in the first place, because it’s incredibly boring without friends. Bad gunplay and lame humor aside, it’s just painfully average. And the ending is an amazing let down, no wonder it caused so much controversy back in the day, because it's absolutely freaking awful. Unless you have a good group of friends to play with, avoid this game like the plague that it is. Better yet, just get the second game, its way more fun and the story keeps you somewhat interested in what's going on."
9580,It's great
9581,If you enjoy a buttload of options for weapons then this is your game.
9582,"Describe yourself.

...You had trouble thinking of attributes, didn't you?
There were just so many things that you got overwhelmed and couldn't think of anything, right?

9586,"This is where it all began.  You just got off a bus in Fyrestone and you meet your first CL4P-TP.

This game is an amazing mix of RPG and FPS genres that take the idea of maximum looting to a whole new level.

Although not Gearbox's crowning achievement (That would have to go to Borderlands 2, IMHO), this game does give you the origin story that is continued in Borderlands 2.  As a result, your playing experience is Borderlands 2 is enhanced, since you now get all the inside references to the first game.

However, as any freshman effort, there's room for improvement.  The first game's skill tree is a bit simplistic compared to Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel.  Pandora is a lot less varied in this game.  Basically it's all desert and dust until the very end.  And to be brutally honest, the games ending sucks.  Not sucks, in the kind of ha ha ho ho way.  Sucks in a big middle finger sort of way that makes you wonder why you just burned 20+ hours of your life.  

Add that to the fact that upon your first discovery of a Rakk Hive, you realize some folks at Gearbox have some SERIOUS mommy issues.  Really guys, it's ok....get some help.

However, after some therapy, you start on the DLC that comes with the game of the year edition (the only version worth buying at this point) and you begin to see how Borderlands 2 came to be.  Philosophically that is.  The DLC is varied in it's locale, and you begin to see the twisted humor come out that is now characteristic of the franchise.  

It's quite interesting to play through as you begin to see some of the mechanics develop with each new DLC.  Culminating in Claptraps New Robot Revolution which feels a lot like....Well....Borderlands 2.

If you only have the scratch to purchase one game, then Borderlands 2 is surely the way to go, it's bigger, funnier, more varied and just a more polished all around game than Borderlands.  But just like there could not be a Diablo 2 without Diablo, you couldn't have Borderlands 2 without Borderlands.  And that alone, is worth the price of admission.



"
9587,"Some issues here and there, but with a friend, this game experience is like any other borderlands, its awsome, action packed and funny, all you need for hours upon hours of playing."
9588,"Have barely played anything, because when my friend logged on, he just kept spinning af. really wierd, and we checked anything that might be wrong with his pc or computer mouse.
Still seems good though."
9589,The best is the series with the best DLC of the series.  A fine game.
9590,"An FPS with RPG elements and over how many guns, Borderlands is definitely an addictive wet dream for gun enthusiasts and roleplayers alike.

Set in the harsh, hostile, barren world of Pandora, you play as one of four badaft mofos who seek to become insanely rich by finding a mysterious Vault. Armed with nothing but an insanely cruddy starting weapon of your profession, you journey across this horrible hellhole of a planet, killing creatures and bandits who are only slightly less badaft than you. 

...and helping out the local populace, but whatever.

Along the way, you eventually become insanely rich anyways because you make a living keeping the best loot for yourself, while selling all the lesser loot. You know, the ones for WUSSES and CHEAPSKATES.

Overall, your goal of finding the Vault immediately becomes an afterthought once you're swimming in all that $$$$ earned from being a surplus dealer of military-grade killing implements.

But hey, at least you now have a more pressing goal: Being the BEST at KILLING THINGS with your AWESOME GUNS AND TECH. You came onto this planet a badaft, and you're not leaving until you're the BADAFTEST VAULT HUNTER OF ALL TIME.



SLIGHTLY MORE SERIOUS REVIEW

It took roughly 35 hours to complete a first-time playthrough of the main game, and boy was it fun.

It's still fun.

Basically, you accept quests, kill things, take the loot, and level up. Then you kill tougher things to get better loot. Sometimes, you do a little jumping and platforming and hunting to find chests which sometimes contain EVEN BETTER loot! Then it's back to accepting quests and leveling up.

The remaining time is spent obsessing over the loot, deciding which ones are awesome and worth keeping, and which ones are deemed unworthy and totally sellable.


The story is actually pretty decent, with multiple recordings fleshing out Pandora's colonization and subsequent abandonment by interplanetary corporations.


The tone of this game is dark, but humorous. Much humor is interspersed between violent and gory imagery that really shows the more sinister, serious side of Pandora and its inhabitants. One particular example is of a good-natured character whom you help and sympathize with for some time, only for a later sidequest to reveal that said character was brutally murdered by cannibalistic Psychos.

(You know, Psychos? Like that shirtless dude with a glowy-eyed mask, who's pointing a finger gun at his head? He's in the store's title image, dang it!)

Additionally, the game cares not for political correctness because, quite frankly, it doesn't fit its incredibly coarse nature. I mean, why would vicious, triggerhappy bandits care about manners or respect? To this game, people who have been driven mad into cannibalism are Psychos, and chaotic, hostile bandits of a smaller stature are Midgets. The game basically tells people to grow a pair and suck it.

And it's hilarious for that.


Music is fairly good. It reminds me of a cross between the desert-y, guitar-filled GLA tracks from Command & Conquer: Generals, as well as the desolate, post-apocalyptic tone from C&C: Tiberium Wars. It's mostly ambient, but more frantic tracks play when you're facing a great danger.


Graphics are pretty good for a 2009 game. It's like one of those 80-90s comic books. You know, the post-apocalyptic desert ones.

The guns in this game are of a more realistic styling, something which I prefer to the beautiful, yet cartoony weaponry style of Borderlands 2. Of course, this also means that gun brands in this game are much less distinct, with guns of differing brands only having different-colored skins in terms of aesthetics.

Statwise, weapons are slightly more overpowered and to the player's advantage, compared to the overly-balanced and weak-feeling weapons of Borderlands 2. Vendors also sell good stuff far more often than Borderlands 2. Save up the money, and the feeling of buying an excellent Legendary weapon from the store is extremely satisfying, much like buying that item you've always wanted.


Play value is great, although the DLCs bring this up to excellent. Replay value is okay, with the ability to bring your endgame character into a higher-leveled playthough as you start the game's story all over again. Be warned that playing on Playthrough 2 and higher increases danger and difficulty, in addition to giving better loot, so make sure your skills and gear are up to par.


Online Co-op is TERRIFICALLY SIMPLE. No ports to forward, no VPN programs to download, just invite a friend or join a friend's game and you're good to go!


Overall, Borderlands is great because it's fun to loot and fun to shoot. There's the satisfaction and cathartic experience of using an awesome gun or skill to mow down a group of monsters and bad people.

It's practically stress relief for your chaotic side."
9591,"Borderlands. This is a game worth your money and time. It has all the needed components to make a good game : cool graphics, interesting story and characters, diversity in weapons and talents, and a free roam world. The coop side is also very thrilling because you can play with your friends with every character you have and you can share things with each other. In short, Borderlands is an amazing game and I definetely recommend it for players looking to have a good time"
9592,"You're going to have a love/hate relationship with this game.
why?
because this game is like SAAB, and you know what they say about SAAB, for every good SAAB there's a bad one out there...
P.S. if you don't know what a SAAB is then you're clearly not old enough to play this game, just sayin'
I'll start with the good things, shall I?

THE BAD THINGS (because I lied)
  1 -so one of the things that drove me up the wall in this game is the glitches... personally I am a fan of glitches as they make a game more unpredictable and fun as well as the fact that they let you break the game's rules not to mention the game itself (that, and the fact that if you can't beat 'em, glitch 'em) but sometimes, just SOMETIMES you're going to get that one glitch with a snapback that's going to be like: you're havin fun? nah bro we can't have that and it's going to ruin your day big time, here are just a few examples of glitches that really wrinkled my sprinkles:
   A - on a highway, speedin' to the next area, while in the car I go to the next area only to appear without the vehicle on foot (that's not supposed to happen but there again we're not supposed to eat and watch TV at the same time so what do I know) well no harm done as the vehicle spawner is 5 meters away from me... so I spawn a vehicle and press on the ""teleport to driver's seat"" as I'm such a lazy f-ck that I can't get myself to walk 5 meters to the car.
I suddenly appear in what I could only describe as a black hole that comes out to be a box shuved up the game's a-
  B - I approach an arena, a boss stage no doubt... long story short, the doors are supposed to close BEHIND ME when I'm already INSIDE the arena to I can't get out, not in FRONT OF ME so that I can't get in... had to quit and come back... wasting a good 2 hours of my gameplay because obviously it was in the one place that didn't have any teleporters so I had to drive there all over again
P.P.S: you'll see what the deal is with the driving once you play those stages.
  2 - how to stop players taking on missions that are too high for their levels? not let them go until they're the right level? nah bro, let them go, we're just not going to tell them about that and make the enemies invincible until they're the right level
P.I.S.S: you'll see what I mean when you'll be spending hours beating that one guy you think is the boss until you finally realize that he's not a boss, just a regular enemy and finally give up after having lost your entire bank account and soul for respawning (yes, you pay to respawn so say goodbye to all that cash you've been saving up in the game to get that one OP weapon in the store)

THE GOOD THINGS (Because I have to)
  1- you can ask your friends to join in on the fun literally at any given moment and not just stick to missions, props to that
  2 - it has moderately good humour (borderlands 2 has much better humor but hey, this is the first one we're talking about)
  3 - the grinding isn't too bad here, for some people (such as myself) grinding can be a major turn-off but don't worry, it's like having sex for the first time, you're going to be fine and if you're a big fan of grinding, well... THPS is that way.

FINAL VERDICT:
well, it's a tough one because this game is like both sides of marmite, there are times that I just want to play the CD backwards to see if satan was in on this but there are also other times when I just want to take the game out for dinner so I'm going to give it aaaa..... 3/5 because it's a bit more fun than frustrating.

P.I.S.S.O.F.F: Its worth getting at least for its multiplayer value.
"
9593,This Game Is very good.But it has some glitches.Long story and overall the game is worth it.
9594,Not as fun as the second game but still worth it on sale for 10 dollars.
9595,This game could cure crack addictions by instilling its own more powerfull addiction. It might help me quit smoking. Hopefuly I can alienate the few friends I have left.
9596,"i can strangely say this was a childhood classic right here,i still love it just as much, great to have it again, i had a hole in my life only borderlands could fill"
9597,"Good game to play with your friends, but there are still  a couple silly problems, but nothing that should stop you from buying."
9598,"I now have this on all platforms its a must for all fps fans, now get off my bus!"
9599,"Worst map, get xp sucks, 1.000.000 shots to kill a simple dog!!"
9600,Shot a space vagina and beat he game. 10/10
9601,"g
"
9602,"Sooooo much fun and especially with a group of friends to go through the epic intense moments of the world with. Then borderlands 2 came... that game is astonishing also! If you are about the originals and ""base"" games, i recommend this one. if you are into alot more content and adjustments with alot more to see/ do, i recommend borderlands 2."
9603,great game with great storyline the grafics may not be up to modern standards but it doesnt look old either it is a game which will never age
9604,"Genius, That's it Pt.2"
9605,"Very good game, 10/10 :)"
9606,awesome!!!
9607,"Play this with friends, its a fun game, got it on launch day and had a lot of fun with it, at the time it was original. 
if you are a newcomer to borderlands this is a good place to start, however playing it solo is boring.

with mates the challenge and the fun factor ramp up
the DLCs are fun to play through too, The armoury of general Knoxx has a tonne of extra content. Mad Moxxis underdome was a bit of a let down tbh.

so if you havent played borderlands 2 or the pre sequel yet, play this, play it with mates and you will enjoy"
9608,"Poop, Loot, Shoot, repeat. 10/10"
9609,Brick/Brick would punch things to death while screaming/laughing again.
9610,Really Really Fun!!!!!!!!!! Just have your drivers upgraded
9611,dont be fooled my my hours spent countless hours on xbone but love the game and intoduced me to my love of farming and i still remember my first time beating the story this game may not me for everyone but it holds a special place in my heart if your started the series at 2 and are thinking of getting this game do get it
9612,"If you love playing games with many, many side quests then this is the game for you"
9613,"Honstly i loved borderlands 2, the presequal was alright, but this just feels kinda clunky.
Get either Borderlands 2, or The presequal over this.

"
9614,"10/10
I killed crabs and burned zombies.
Plus I opened a vault that made sequels and presequels.
Would open vault again!"
9615,"Owned and played Borderlands on a console. Loved it so much I bought it for PC and am playing it all over again.

Pro:
- Storyline
- Character classes
- FPS w/ RPG
- Many weapons, abilities, side quests and DLC content
- Graphic style unique and attractive; great music and sound
- HIgh replay value; hundreds of game play hours
- Many achievements
- Single and Coop game play; able to use same character across different game plays

Con:
- Some boses seem unreasonably difficult no matter your character level (Crawmerax)
- Some achievements are tedious to accomplish"
9616,"Basic rpg and shooter, but really fun. Options with the guns, bullets, add some color to the game and the universe is funny, yet the story is good. Even if the second is better, the first is a good game easy to enjoy."
9617,VERY VERY GOOD GAME !
9618,"Good game, very witty.
The game really shines in it's DLC, you can skip moxie if you wish (Just arena fights)"
9619,"Can be quite buggy at times (mission logic is the most at fault here), but really quite worth your time."
9620,"Should really be called ""Timesuck"" as this game, especially the game of the year version, has an insane amount of content contained within. A great game to pick up and play and also a great game to leave on the shelf for a bit. Just make sure you go to your Graphics Card preferences and turn on V-sync or the game will tear something awful!"
9621,"10/10 ""It was okay"" - IGN"
9622,"Pro's:
- It's story is nice;
- Great range of guns
- Variety of builds
- Co-op

Con's:
- Very poor graphics
- Sluggish gameplay
- You cannot skip movies or intro's. Not that I found that is. {very annyoing is beginning of game);

Conclusion: Although story is good it's not worth the money. Buy Borderlands 2. I find it better, more fastpaced and excellent DLC."
9623,"I will go as far to say that Borderlands is a perfect game. It took me a few half play throughs to get through, but this is not because the game is not enjoyable, I just loose track of where I am in a game if I put it down for a few weeks, this past week however, I blastered through the whole game, the full game with all of the side quests took me twenty hours to complete.  I am now starting ""playthrough #2"" which is essentially, the same, just with scaled up enemies. 

I love the looting system, the gun mechanics, the quests, the story, I just love this whole game. Yes I am a little bit late to the party, and yes most people will already have Borderlands sitting in their library, but play it, finish it, enjoy it, it's an absolutely joy to play. 

You get a real feel of success when you reach the final stages of the game, there is no better feeling than finding a phat gun, that you can rip through tons of enemies with, dropping your defense turret to shield yourself while you finish off another fifteen skags.

I seriously cannot wait to get stuck into my second playthrough and jumping into some online games. 

One again, this for me, is a perfect game."
9624,"I got killed by a burning miget running at me with an axe. 10/10 would die again...
Best Shoot N Loot game on Steam
95/100"
9625,"Pretty good, however the sequal is one million times better. Once you've played it you'll never go back to the orginal.

A good game itself but why still play when Borderlands 2 is out?"
9626,VERY fun(ny) game. I r8 this game 8/8 m8.
9627,"Infelizmente Borderlands não foi um dos melhores jogos que eu joguei,o jogo até que oferece uma boa proposta mas cai muita na repetição .Algumas das missões,não tem fundamento lógico e se tornam desnecessárias e tornam a experiência do jogo muito fraca .

Personagen sem nenhum carisma e os que tem,parece que foi totalmente forçado .

Talvez esse jogo seja legal de se jogar com amigos,pois o mesmo trás a opção de coop,no mais não é divertido em nenhum momento.

Não recomendo este jogo para quem gosta de jogos de FPS com um pouco de ação,pois Borderlands por contem elementos de RPG e torna a jogatina um pouco mais parado .

Ouvi dizer que o Borderlands 2 é melhor que o primeiro jogo,então bora conferir."
9628,Great shooter where tactical play style can actually pay off. One of the few games where sniping actually feels like sniping.
9629,Bad ass game...wish I would have gotten it sooner
9630,I LIKE THIS GAME ND PUSSEY
9631,"SO. what can i say about this game.
I've played this 100's of hours !
i've had this game since it was a non-steam game (hence the little hours here)

the field of view isn't all that great but there are workarounds for it . 
the graphics are fine (even though they're just a little outdated and wonky at times)
and it's filled with puns.! 

the best part is that it's replayable in 4 different ways since you have 4 characters to play with with all different styles. and theres literally HOURS of gameplay which you will enjoy a lot. 
i'm pretty sure there might be one of em that suits you're likings.

+MULTIPLAYER 
this is loads of fun when you play it with a few of you're friends!
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU BLOW STUFF UP WITH 4 FRIENDS BECAUSE .. REASONS !!!! 
i was surprised at how the mechanics were and how this game progresses throughout playing it. 
it's a solid buy, runs pretty well and looks good for it's time.

i would recommend you buying the GOTY version if you do though to get the full understading out of it.

EXPLOSIONS/10 !"
9632,"Nice mix between a shooter and a RPG.
In other words, you're mobhunting and doing quests with guns.
Very special (in a good way) graphics and art-style.
Only points of criticism is the lack in variety of scenery and types of enemies.
Also, the fact that I just bought the sequel speaks for itself.
"
9633,Its pretty great.
9634,Awesome game and cool graphics!
9635,"Pros:
+Large array of guns to use
+Great Gameplay
+Entertaining Humor
+Unique Enemies and Bosses
+Interesting characters
+Immersive surroundings
+It's Borderlands!!!!! What else do you need to know??!!

Cons:
+Lacklustre skills
+Storyline Lacks Creativity
+Minor Enemy gliches"
9636,"For anyone coming from Borderlands 2 wanting to see where it all started here are a few pros and cons in comparison with BL2:

Pros:
- Much better loot system. Anyone who has clocked in enough time in Borderlands 2 will know that finding anything better than Green is fairly uncommon, but in this you will be find 10 times better and more varied loot and twice as often.
- Fairer Scaling. The scaling in this game is Linear instead of Borderlands 2's Exponential, meaning that when you find a powerful weapon, it will be useful for much longer before having to replace it with a more powerful weapon.
- Easier to run. Granted this is just due to it being older but even still, it's something I guess.
- Cheaper. Again this is just due to it's age, but still, the GOTY is cheaper than the bsae game of Borderlands 2.
- Backstory to Borderlands 2.
- Able to play as Brick, Roland, Lilith and Mordecai. Awesome NPCs, Awesomer Playable characters.
- [spoiler]Modding ability. This game can actually have modded content, although it's not officially supported by the devs.[/spoiler]

Personal Opinion:
- Different feel. This game has a more dark and serious feel than the second Borderlands game. Some people may like it, some may not.
- All the Areas have the same look to them. Every area is either a desert-like area, run-down buildings or Atlas buildings, with the Zombie DLC and the final area being the only exceptions. Again this can be a matter of opinion.

Cons:
- Skill Trees. The characters skill trees aren't as fleshed out as in Borderlands 2, with the major gamechanger 1 point skills not being there. While i'm not in any way saying the skill trees are bad, they're just lacking something that Borderlands 2 has.
- Voice acting. The voice acting in this game can feel very hit or miss at times, with some characters sounding cool, while others feel very flat and last-minute.
- Animations. Same as above, some animations are good, while others feel robotic and basic.

Overall
Worth getting if you want to see where it all started, although as a first purchase in the Borderlands franchise, it's better going with number 2. Get if on sale and definitely get the GOTY.
8/10"
9637,Vjak Should buy this!
9638,"Reviews are boring, so lets get this over with. I love the game but I had a hard time keeping track of which quest was the main one and for some weird reason my current quest would switch sometimes when I did an objective. Either way I enjoyed the game and I look forward to playing Borderlands 2. I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy fps and rpg elements and a nuke full of comedy in between."
9639,"Great game, having a blast with it :D"
9640,*giggle* I'm really good at this!
9641,"I found rocket-propelled grenades in a toilet 

10/10"
9642,Helveti hyvä ja hauska Co-oppina.
9643,fun enough to keep you entertained when youve beaten everything else
9644,"Great game with unique art style.  Solid gameplay with endless loot.  Awesome storyline with a badass vibe to it.  And best of all, 4 player co-op."
9645,Good game. gg
9646,Great Co-op game.  Some glitches here and there but nothing major.    Good for hours of gameplay with your friends.
9647,Don't worry it's good.
9648,"Showing its age, but this is still a great game.

If you've come from the newer Borderlands, put aside the clunky gameplay, and enjoy the story and humour!

Also, the FOV fix is a must. the default is 60, but I have mine at 110."
9649,Excelente juego
9650,i liked it
9651,"Boringlands with guns :)

Pro's : 

- Characters
- Humor


Con's : 

- tons of useless drop
- car handling
- problems with animation
- shaked camera
- tedious 
- bugs
- raw

Conclusion :

It's a sketch of Borderlands 2"
9652,Love it. Must be played by everyone.
9653,Awesome..one word..
9654,Worst Wendy's ive ever been to.  But the game is awesome.  Super fun and tons of hours and the best of all.  a never ending amount of guns and enemies to kill
9655,"Borderlands is a great game, full of witty humor and sarcasm, both of which, are used as weapons. It has a very good plot and interesting characters, both support characters and the main cast. Weapons are abundant and one can go through the whole game with his desired tactics, changing them occasionally. Action packed, visceral and fast, with not a boring moment on it. Definitely a good option to buy, even more so if it is in a discount."
9656,best game
9657,My friend keeps managing to own my ass
9658,Just one word (((AMAZING)))
9659,"Looks like a cell shaded FPS right? It's so much more though. Excellent characters (no space marine/special forces types here), no competitive multiplayer means it superbly concentrates on story and the afore mentioned characters, crude, loud, and loads of kit to collect and customise your character with- in fact, I would compare it to a FPS version of Diablo 3. I'm far from the biggest fan of FPS games but I cannot recommend this highly enough."
9660,Dope game.
9661,"Borderlands is a really sweet game at its worst it can feel repetitive especially if you are try to beat ever quest as well. But this changes as soon as you get that next level, that new awesome weapon, or discover a brand new amazing area you haven't seen before. Overall great game worth every penny."
9662,"This game is very amazing. The GoTY Edition was an amazing price. Compared to the console version, this is a lot more fun, and the controls are a lot easier, which makes it a lot more fun. I plan on buying Borderlands 2 GoTY Edition!"
9663,ILY
9664,"Super game! Great story, tons of hours of gameplay"
9665,i think is an ok game when playing online with freinds. agrea
9666,"Get guns, kill things, get loot.
Get better guns, kill better things, get better loot
Get amazing guns, kill massive things, get awesome loot
10/10 would loot again"
9667,"I have sooooooooooooo many hours logged on borderlands! This is so much fun with friends and easily one of my favorite games ever made. I highly reccomend this game for anyone and everyone. Slapstick comedy and GUNS, GUNS, GUNS!"
9668,"You can look in peoples mail boxes, and get loot.
10/10"
9669,"Massive game with the DLC recommended excellent, I must like it 173 hrs woo hoo."
9670,10/10 would bang moxxi again
9671,Big and fabulous. Fallout 3 and New Vegas fans in particular should look here for more polished gunplay with some satisfying kick to it.
9672,"Best FPS/RPG game ever.
Not that hard to play, you just need to understand how the game works, pretty big map exploration, 2 gameplays, a lot of tricks including easter eggs.
Definetly the game I enjoy yhe most to play.
DLC's are amazing, at least 3 of them, Moxxi's Underdome is just an arena, not some bonus content, and it takes a lot of time to finish all 6 of them. But would recommend them all definetly.
100/100!"
9673,"only problem with this game is the graphics give me a head ache
"
9674,"[b]Graphics:[/b] +, Love the Style but the details are okay
[b]Story:[/b] +
[b]Sounds:[/b] +
[b]Fighting System:[/b] +, There are more than 1,000,000 weapons"
9675,"I know this game is not the 2, or the pre sequal, but this game still as fun as the other two games. Really for me its a 9/10, its a mix of fallout, call of duty, and rage. besides the point of that it does has great humor like in the other two games, along side with being fun to play with friends, family etc."
9676,SO awesome and hilarious. I r8 8/8 m8.
9677,"Buy the game of the year edition. The core game's story is rather bland. The fun gameplay is what keeps you going. Loot is shiny and abundant. Borderlands didn't have much budget to start with. This game got immensely popular and got budget. This provided them with the tools they needed too craft perfect DLC. DLC is not like a part of the core game that is sold to you seperatly. No it provides you with new areas, better stories, more loot and more fun. 
It has coöp. It's not drop in, drop out. You have to start and end together and the host has to quit last everytime or some save game issues may occur. Its best played with at least two other friends."
9678,"Do you like loot? Do you like shooting midgets in the face and be rewarded with a fountain of blood as they let go of their soul? Do you like playing with your friends in coop?

Then you'll loveeeeeeeeee Borderlands!"
9679,"Warning: Unlike in Borderlands 2, where multiplayer gives all players the same experience points, this game gives experience more fairly, based on damage done to enemies. I'm a terrible shot who plays with an experienced player: fighting the first boss, and he's halfway to level 6 while I haven't even reached level 5.

Not recommended for people who aren't that great at shooting. Go for the second game instead."
9680,I played this after i played Borderlands 2 and really enjoyed it.  Lacks the stroy of 2 but still delivers on combat and variety of loot.  Definetly worth a play through.
9681,"Cool Graphics... 10
Nice gameplay... 10
kill the bandits... 10
Collect everything... 10"
9682,"If you haven't already bought this game, and love FPS and RPG games, buy it.
Buy the whole series, whether separate or in the Collection.
You won't regret it.

Just give the first game some time to ramp up, it starts a bit slow."
9683,"Vey nice one. With lots of guns, a convincing setting, some guns, good design, a few guns there and there, funny dialog (if scarce) and characters, some more guns, rpg elements, guns, and fast paced action. And guns.

Apart from that the game is very well optimized and stable, and runs perfectly on my old 2008 computer, so a must have if you have not tried it yet.

Did I mention de guns?"
9684,There is no reason not to have this game.
9685,"It comes at you at a slower, more deliberate pace than Borderlands 2, and it's a bit rougher around the edges, but there's just that little spark of charm that keeps you going.  After the color, variety, and velocity of the sequels, a change of pace in the form of grey guns in a big tan desert is kinda refreshing.  Can't speak as an RPG fan, but this is an exceptional first-person shooter in its own right, combining old-school player-directed run n' gun tendencies with a lot of modern flair and a defiantly distinct narrative sensibility.  And things go bang and make other things explode, sometimes into gore."
9686,"Great game, cool guns,fun map,main girl has a nice booty and theres midgets 11/10"
9687,"FPS, co-op, action/adventure RPG with Insane amount of weapons to choose from. Comical characters. Entertaining story and expansions that are highly worth purchasing. Great series to play through."
9688,it is a god and funny game
9689,"I will never understand why people like this game. FOV is broken and it's just an MMO. You do grindy things to make your number bigger and your aim is terrible until later on. Final boss doesn't move or attack you.

All the guns feel the same; they may look different but because it's an MMO-style game, you don't care about the looks, you just want the bigger numbers. I never formed an attachment on any gun because they're all so expendable."
9690,very funny gore game i say its 10/10 AWESOME!!!!!!!!
9691,"Excellent game with plenty to do! However the ending is absolute garbage, so if you're coming for a good plot/story BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
9692,"it's a ga
me
"
9693,awsome game
9694,"great game, I was sceptical at first but I'm glad I kept at it, lots of fun"
9695,Guns...
9696,"Played Borderlands 2 first and bought this baby to know what I missed and what's the initial story is about. Unfortunately, it is becoming a TL:DR kind of gameplay as most of the story is described on the mission log and not much audio discussion to understand what's going on. I'm glad they changed that in Borderlands 2. So far, I'm not sure if I even want to continue, This one is really showing it's age, compared to BL2."
9697,"It's great when a game automagically sets the graphics settings to lowest so you can play on your crappy laptop without having to think. It's also great when a game is so awesome that it takes 30 hours out of your time in a couple of days, even when you have assessments to hand in. What am I trying to say? This game is great. That's what. Even on lowest settings it looks great, thanks to the best art style in all of games. It also helps fuel my need for many screenshots of ""Pis Off"" signs, which is fantastic. And it lets you explode the face of a guy with 9 toes and 3 balls. And that's all on top of a brilliant array of weird weapons - such as revolvers with scimitars taped on - and too many brilliant quests and sidequests to count. And on top of all that, it has CL4P-TP - better known as Claptrap - as a main character. What else can I say about this to make you buy it now or die alone forever?"
9698,"Great game, don't play without co-op though, game is playable by yourself but co-op makes the game awesome."
9699,un buen jugo la hirtoria es muy buena supieron a que tratar los graficos son buenos igual que los personajes el personage que mas me gusto es brik muy modesto y con buenas abilidades ya que puedes aumentar su fuersa de los puños y tan bien puedes ganar dinero aunque algunas beses lo niveles son algo difisiles si no heres mayor de nivel ami la mision que mas me gusto es la de matar a destructor los DLC son buenos como la isla del doctor ned esta isla es de zombies y es muy buena mas por la mison de serebros donde vuelbes a ver a T.K y te pide que le des de comer dandole serebros y tienes que ir a matar a zobies volandoles la cabesa para que salgan los serebros es una buena mision para mi borderlands tanto su historia y sus DLC son buenos y geniales yo lo recomiendo para los que buscan divertirse un rato pueden jugar solos o en online el online es bueno puedes jugar agusto con tus amigos y con otros jugadores de borderlands yo lo recomiendo para que juegen agusto y se entretengan un rato en su historia y su multijugador.
9700,Nice one!
9701,"It's a great game, and definitely equal to its sequel. Tons of fun co-op or singleplayer. Lots of guns. DLC makes the game better, and at this point, it's included in the $20. It's currently on sale for $5. 
Only downside is field of view.
8/10."
9702,Just keep shooting enemies until they die as you progress with better equipment. Originality 8/8. I like it. <3
9703,It is a very fun game. But in short..................Its gun porn
9704,lol
9705,good game good price
9706,Even after all these years I can still pick it up and play it like it was new. So much replayability. Thanks!
9707,:)
9708,"This game really blows. The graphics are interesting if you're into cell shading done right, but other than that, it's your standard poor man's action RPG. Writing a longer review about this game would be a waste of time. Spend your time on something better."
9709,"Great game! First one of the series made a great first impression, and I couldn't be a bigger and more loyal fan to the Borderlands series!"
9710,"What can you say about Borderlands that hasn't already been said? Well, probably a lot, but I doubt much of it would actually be relevent to this game. I've only done one playthrough which spanned 19 hours of actual gameplay over 2 or 3 months, because my guild in WoW had me raiding so damn much. That alone should speak to how great this game is. Think about playing a game off and on over the course of 2 or 3 months. For many games, you might lose interest. I certainly lose interest in most games if I'm playing like this. However, Borderlands kept my attention throughout. The funny dialogue, the very fun combat, the excellent equipment and inventory system, and the ""comical"" look of the game kept my interest and kept me coming back expecting (and receiving) lots of fun. One thing that almost everyone seems to agree on would be the ending. I'm not going to go into specifics, even though at this point if anything gets spoiled it's your own damned fault. However, I'm hoping that maybe people who have not yet played Borderlands might read this review before deciding whether or not they want to buy and play it. As epic as this game is, the ending seems to be quite anticlimactic. Throughout the game, things tend to pick up steadily. Then, you get to the final boss, and you're left wondering....ok, where's the epic boss I've been expecting in this game? Well...unfortunately, it's not really there. The final boss is kind of out of place according to the story of Borderlands. This final entity definitely could have been referenced better in previous parts of the game, leading up to a more ""expected"" final boss, which in turn would lead to more satisfaction upon defeating it. That said, I still absolutely love Borderlands, even with my one playthrough. I've told my friends many times that I plan to play through this game on each of the other classes as well (first time was on Lilith the Siren) but, other games keep on taking up my time. Now lets talk a bit about DLC. Buy it. Buy all of it. Now. I was completely satisfied with every bit of DLC for Borderlands. It was all very fun, very intense, and very awesome. That's really all I can say about it, because it's just so simply amazing. 9/10 for Borderlands, 10/10 for Borderlands DLC. If you decide to go ahead with this game, good luck and have fun, Vault Hunters!"
9711,"One of the best games. You might think RPG and FPS don't go well, but this is one of the few that nailed it. I highly recommend this game. Great gameplay, great storyline and i live the graphic style of the game, suits it well."
9712,"""You remind me of my mother... I ate my mother.""  - Psycho 

Same"
9713,"I'm waiting for this game to hook me, like, I want to like this game given it's popularity but so far I'm just not getting it."
9714,"Great game, played it in splitscreen with my friend on a PS3 when it originally came out. Best memory of it probably being how we betted on which one could kill the last boss with only a knife first.

He won.

And i still haven't paid him.

5/5 :D"
9715,"-First Impressions-
Ah, Borderlands. I was asked to play it from several thousand people, be it my friends, to journalists (if indirect). It was on sale so I figured 'eh, why not.'

I was told many things, all of them were great.
So how does it shape up so far?

Well, I began to play with the Siren, since her style sorta matches mine (added effects vs. raw power)
Her ablilty is a panic button and I love it. 

The gunplay is enjoyable.
Those I've dealt with are likable.
There are plenty of weapons.

Its not a very funny game.
Graphics are jagged (I'm not playing on a gaming rig. Its more of a note, not a point)
It's not that funny.
Sniping feels really good
Its just not that funny.
I bet I'll be dealing with psychos more often, right?
Claptrap is annoying.
Guys. Its not a funny game.
I like to imagine a laugh track playing in my head when Flaptrap does anything at all.
""Look at me! I'm dancin! IM DANCING!!"" *Laugh track*
""I'm gonna go enjoy a study about the wonders of sand!"" *Laugh track*
""He also has three balls"" *Laugh track*
Its a first person shooter.
That fails to be funny to me.
I've had some great moments though. 

The rundown looks like this:
+ Nice amount of weapons
+ Clear Loot system
+ Enjoyable gunplay that has a way to keep you on your toes somehow
+ Its got Shields
+ I already have a few good stories to tell

- Its not funny to me. Maybe when I was younger the three balls joke would've killed me...
- Why is claptrap there? I could've gone without him. I understand the point of having some kind of compainion, so give me wheatly instead. He's actually funny.
- Do Skrags ever die? Or are they gonna simply be a constant nuisence.

Yes I am beating home this games 'comedy', cuz I was told by many that it is funny. Don't let them fool you.

7/10"
9716,Don't play this if you like more than 3 palettes of colors in your games.
9717,"I shot a midget with an electrified revolver and his head exploded.



10/10 would fight midgets again"
9718,"Punched a guy in the face
Their whole body exploded into a million tiny bloody pieces

10/10 would berzerk tank again"
9719,"When I first started playing, I loved the characters, the art, and the entire feel of the game.  I even liked the story line before it got really.. old.  I feel like this game had a lot of potential, but I don't want to sit on that thought and let it change my initial view:  There is not ""enough"" to this game.  It feels like a constant grind, get a quest, kill some stuff, go to this place, repeat.  I got tired of it after awhile.  I ended up not caring about the story at all, or about any of the characters.

I felt like the game was too easy, even the bosses that were supposed to be a big deal weren't really a challenge.  Maybe I was playing on too easy of a difficulty but when your enemies are easy to kill, the game ruins the only aspect it had going for it to begin with.

It is true that there are a lot of weapons in this game and it's nice when you get a decent one, but finding a REALLY nice weapon seems close to impossible, or at least, I have never found a cyan colored weapon out of all my playtime in Borderlands.  I understand it SHOULD be hard to find a really good weapon but the difference between a great weapon and a good weapon is pretty astounding.

If you go ahead and buy this game, I would suggest that you don't play it alone.  Play with one of your friends, two of your friends, or whatever.  Mic at the same time and hopefully you'll be talking enough to ignore the negative aspects of the game.  It will stay fun as long as your friends don't progress on their own i.e. play Lilith and phase walk in / phase walk out of nearly every encounter.  It's an okay game to pass the time but I couldn't imagine playing through it more than once.  It just gets too old."
9720,"Great game,runs smooth on wins 8.1"
9721,"This is my favourite FPS of all time.
That is all I can say about this but ive payed for 3 different copies...
PS3 GOTY, CD, Steam GOTY.
It is that good."
9722,"I could go on for hours and hours (literally) about how much I love this game. To save you the time, I am just going to have to sum it up by saying that THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE GREATEST CREATIONS IN THE HISTORY OF VIDEO GAMES. And you should seriously play it."
9723,"I LOVE this game, so much to do!"
9724,"Kicks butt!
Funny stuff too."
9725,Best game ever.
9726,"A must have.

Started with Borderlands 2... Stopped immediately to check the first one, no regrets.

Do not screw it and get the GOTY edition !!!"
9727,"I shot a midget 

10/10"
9728,"Amazing and unique. I can play for hours on end and I would still want to keep playing. Gameplay is great, as well as co-op. Story could be more in-depth. Overall, 10/10!"
9729,I really like this game what to heck
9730,BRAINS!
9731,meeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhh
9732,"Fun game and really good RPG elements!

By the time of this review you have the borderlands 2! Sure you like FPS RPG?
Try both they are really great games!"
9733,2 people can not play at the same time like the xbox version. how fucking stupid
9734,"If you like a RPGs with great replayability, not to mention a fantastic and hilarious (at times) story, Borderlands is definitely one to check out."
9735,"Bought this game for my girlfriend and myself when it was on sale a few weeks ago.
Probably one of the best purchases I have made.

I loved the Borderlands series since it came out on the console and now playing it on PC.
Why get this game?
Pros:
- Funny dialog of characters
- Played Borderlands 2? Confused about things? Play this game and find out!
- So many guns. Like, it's mind-bottling (yes, mind-bottling) how many guns there are.
-- Example: A shotgun that shoots rockets.
- Deserts, lot of desert. Okay, not really a positive.. but the maps are HUGE.
- 50+ hour game. (Completing all main and side missions)
- Getting the Game of the Year edition gets you four DLCs:
-- Mad Moxxi Underdome
-- Dr. Ned's Zombie Island
-- General Knoxx Secret Armory
-- Claptrap's Robot Revolution

You are probably wondering about the cons.
Well, here are the cons:
- The graphics are a bit dated, I mean it's from 2009
- Little dialog between the players 
- 20 dollars for the regular, 30 for the GOTY (Get it on sale)
- Main Menu interface is not as clean and BL2 (Given, it's from 2009)

I believe that if you buy this game, you will have fun. Even more fun with your friends.
Cheers and Welcome to the Borderlands!"
9736,probably the best and longest game in the series.
9737,"If you don't own borderlands, you're not a friend of mine."
9738,"""Who needs a real doctor when you have my machines and their scary needles""..


You Just 

- Collect guns 
- Kill things
- Collect better guns
- Kill bigger things.

And there's nothing more amazing than the lighthearted pleasure of setting a half-naked psychopath on fire with a sniper rifle while screaming the chorus for ""Light My Fire"" in the middle of the night.

Get this game."
9739,My Borderlands doesn't launch anymore :(
9740,"Really fun game, heaps of content. Can't wait to play the others!"
9741,"GREAT
10/10"
9742,Honestly it's still pretty good.
9743,One of the best RPG shooters out there. I'd recommend buying Game Of The Year edition over just the game itself. You get much more out of the game and you save a load of money.
9744,If ur lookin to Catch A Ride then this is the game for you.
9745,"I level-up too quick, now my friends are all mad. #ThanksObama."
9746,"Very good game,good graphics,tons of content, the conversations are delightful and very funny ! My rating for this game is 9.5/10. Would recomand to anyone !"
9747,i cant stop playing
9748,"Badass.  It's an older game now, but if you turn up the textures and resolution; and turn on ambient occlusion the actual gameplay looks about as good as the second game.  Highly recommended along with Borderlands 2.  Great cartoony graphics, funny storyline with plenty of adult oriented humor, and high paced first person shooter gun combat.  I'm also an RPG nut, like to fight outclassed, and am a sucker for gigantic arcade style bosses.  The hand drawn textures, cartoon-like modeling, and border edge rendering around the models give the game a rich visual quality.  Play control and gameplay are excellent.  After playing this series, I'm hooked.  I also recommend acquiring the game of the year edition of both Borderlands and Borderlands 2.  The extra downloadable content makes these games super mega ultra badass.  If you can pick them both up on sale, definitely do it."
9749,Catch a riiiiiiiiiiiiide
9750,A pretty good looting simulator.
9751,"Possibly my new favorite game. Gory with the right amount of charm that it's tasteful. The guns are beautiful and effective and the dialogue is very funny and witty. It also has plot twists and challenges and well thought out stories. The missions are always intriguing and difficult but move at the right pace for someone new to the game, so it doesn't cause aggravation. It always runs well and It's well worth the price."
9752,"The original Shoot-'N-Loot FPSRPG that captured my greed. Unlike the sequels, your health and shield numbers actually count for something. I think the highest I got my Bezerker's health to was ~2,000HP and I could fight armies of overleveled enemies and still some out on top whereas in Borderlands 2, I got Krieg to over 3,000,000 health/shields with about 20-25% DR and I still got my ass handed to me regularly."
9753,"Great shooter, but only play in co-op. Otherwise it's extremely boring."
9754,In my opinion the first Borderlands is by far the best one in the series thus far and i would highly recommend playing this one first before any of the other ones! however im not saying the latest two arent great but for me i think they went too overboard with the story that didnt even turn out that great.
9755,One of the best games in existence. i recommend it to everyone who likes to loot and shoot
9756,Love this game

(It's a rather nice game, but BL2 is just simply better.  It has its moments, but for the most part, it's just not as interesting, challenging, colourful and over-the-top as its sequel.)"
9758,I love this game! But I wouldn't buy it for PC again because Couch-Coop is just available if you play it on Xbox etc..... And every game is better with Splitscreen^^
9759,Claptraps! need I say more?
9760,"THIS GAME IS THE MOST FUN I HAVE EVER HAD PLAYING ANYTHING!!! Engaging story, good graphics, FLAWLESS gameplay... Usually. Anyway, lots of fun!"
9761,No
9762,"This game its amazing, its so adictive and very funny every one just musta have this one in yours pc's or consoles"
9763,sugoi and have a lots of mobs kawaiis
9764,"The first Borderlands game is fun, but a bit tedious at times. The cartoon-like graphic style of the game is awesome and the characters in the game are awesome. If you aren't all that interested in the Borderlands lore you should buy either Borderlands 2 or the pre-sequel instead. But if you are like me and love pretty much everything Borderlands related it goes without saying that you should buy Borderlands GOTY edition.
I wish there was a bit more voice acting, but they fixed that in Borderlands 2 and the pre-sequel."
9765,Game with humor :D A game that will sure give you hours of fun!
9766,"Playing Borderlands makes you enjoy playing Borderlands 2 more from the return of characters and locations, but Borderlands 2 is better in every way."
9767,"Great game! It's a very good action RPG, the world is immersive and easy to get into."
9768,I think we all know what this game is about. Not quite as good as the later games but still fun.
9769,"Take 4 treasure hunters, mix in wild west style characters and throw it in space. you get a goofy FPSRPG with days of content, make it co-op and its even better. this game is a must for FPS and RPG fans everywhere. packed full of great writing and cultural refrances. you find something new every time you explore a map, even if you have been to that map a dozen times already."
9770,"I found this more fun than the sequal. Really enjoyable. The jokes would get old after the 1st playthrough, so the game would get really boring the 2nd time."
9771,"some how i have the game of the year edition even thouh i payed for the standard

great game 9.9/10 gets boring after a wile"
9772,"I love Borderlands, ALWAYS! It's kill or BE killed. Adapt, level up, gain better loot, and LOCK AND LOAD ITS TIME TO LIGHT 'EM UP!"
9773,"Great game, good gameplay sometimes a litle chunky lots of humour so i would say play it"
9774,where it`s all start!
9775,It's a great game and very enjoyable with friends.
9776,Woo
9777,The only Borderlands Game with a Good Loot system.
9778,Worst borderlands ever
9779,Great game! I have 23 hours on record and I still have lots of things to do in the game. I'm realy excited to carry on with the rest of the franchise!
9780,"Not as good as BL2, it was really difficult to enjoy the gameplay and how slow you move. But still it was their first in the francise, buy it if you want but I gotta say; BL2 is way better. 3/10"
9781,just get the damn game. worth every penny.
9782,Recently bought the GOTY edition on sale for $7.50. And now I'm a lvl50 Berserker... 10/10 would berserk again
9783,"Hunter looks like a gimp, Sniper is cool, EXP is dumb, Claptrap is annoying, Shooting people feels good."
9784,"I originally played this game on my old laptop & it does not even meet the specs (except for the RAM, I had upgraded to 4GB when I got it---all the motherboard would allow). However, the game ran exceedingly well on it & was very enjoyable.
So, if you're looking for a game that can run on a single-core processor, 4 GB of RAM, a 128 MB GPU (not NVIDIA or Radeon, I don't think--can't remember, but I know it wsn't NVIDIA & it had an Intel processor, so Radeon would be exceedingly unlikely anyways), then play this game. It's fun, has somewhat comedic characters, a very simple GUI for the menu (I don't play 2 much because the GUI is trippy & the combat system seems broken)."
9785,"First of all! :  If you are not a fan, check story somewhere online and buy second piece.

The game is a nice, lively and humorous.

DLC are well-developed.

Multiplayer is dead.

Need more info? Why?"
9786,"You know I loved this game when I went for completion instead of getting off quick!
"
9787,this game is INSANE ! its imposible not to have fun in it ! i dare you to try and prove me wrong !
9788,"Very L33t game, I had very fun playing."
9789,"I rushed through this game with friends when it came out, had fun, but most of the time I didn't know what was going on. They were always in such a rush. Borderlands 2 came out and history repeated itself, only this time everyone else got bored by the time we reached level 11.

I started on my own and finished the whole thing, then all the DLC, then a second playthrough. Then I decided to go back to the original Borderlands. This game was where it all started. The DLC is great too, Zombie Island and Captraps Robolution in particular.

Do yourself a favour, if you remotely enjoyed Borderlands 2 and you haven't tried this one, get it, especially if it's on sale. You'll either love this more than the second, or get more Borderlands out of it. There's plenty of story and fun to be had."
9790,"GIMME A BUCKET, AND I'LL SHOW YOU A BUCKET !!!"
9791,I shot an angry midget with a sniper rifle.
9792,"One the all-time greats as far as First person shooters.  The storyline is disjointed but fun and the rewards make doing the side missions actually worth doing.

The guns are random and the loot is obscene.  This game brought a new defintion to ""lootsplosion"" and the DLCs have done nothing but ramped that up to even greater heights.

The aiming and actual gameplay is fast and frenetic.  I wouldn't say the AI was exactly intelligent, but when they actually attack, it's time to find cover in most cases or die.

Definitely a good game!"
9793,"The game has a peculiar almost sketched kind of appearance to it. This game was a lot of fun, but was very long. It is not terribly challenging as the missions do not reset when you die. Most of the missions can be done in any order, but if done too early in the game, can be near impossible to complete. The creatures are interesting and the enemies numerous, overall I would recommend this game."
9794,"A great story with tons of interesting and fun quests, a massive variety of weapons and combat styles, and an endlessly replayable co-op masterpiece. If you're looking for a game to play with 1-3 friends, Borderlands is pretty much the yard stick for FPS/RPG!"
9795,"Robot taught me how to dance.
10/10 would tbag him again."
9796,"Spent hours on this... Next sale, get it with all it's DLC and prepare to sacrifice hundreds of hours of your life !"
9797,"My very seriously taken Pro's and Con's for this game:

+ Awesome weapons to obliderate your enemies although they will probably obliderate you
+ Most cutest robot in the world (Also known as CL4P-TP, but you can call him Claptrap)
+ Awesome and literally insane bosses
+ You can destroy your friends. Or actually work with them but who the **** cares about that if you can shoot them in the head
+ 4 classes, all fantastic and destructive (but not all very wise).
+ After playing 8 hours still learning new stuff and getting more shit tons of new kind of weapons.
+ Unthinkable skills that only weirdos can have (oh, and they are awesome as well.)

- Depleting your time for school and other important things. 
But who the **** cares about that if you can destroy some of those stupid skags or kill all those psychos with your amazing shotgun which is able to shoot them 5 metres in the air! 

Why are you reading this? Get the game and kill your friends and have fun!"
9798,"A game that I played/loved when it was first released and I will always go back to.
fps/rpg at its best."
9799,Better than Borderlands 2 even if you're playing alone.
9800,most fun game that has guns in it
9801,great game for co-op play. play the GOTY edition for better n longer experience
9802,"Fun combat and a steady flow of rewards make this journey a massively enjoyable one, especially with some fellow mercenaries along for the ride.

On the hostile, bandit-ridden planet of Pandora, there is one thing that draws off-world attention: The Vault. This mysterious alien structure is rumored to hold treasures of fantastic power and wealth, and so it attracts fortune-seeking corporations and individuals alike. In Borderlands, you are one such individual, but the satisfaction of unlocking the Vault's secrets pales in comparison to the rollicking good time you'll have on your way there. Borderlands is all about the journey, not the destination, and like most trips, this one is much better when you have some friends along for the ride. Solo players can still have a good time, because the bloody and entertaining combat is paired well with rewarding loot and engaging experience systems. But Pandora is a lonely place for a solitary mercenary, and lone wolves will find the pace deliberate and the friendly characters too few and far between. Those who take advantage of the four-player online cooperative mode will experience the game as it's meant to be played. The pleasing rhythm of killing enemies, gathering loot, and cashing in is punctuated by fighting bosses, completing quests, and leveling up. As a solo merc, this rhythm is slow and methodical, but as a team, the pace quickens to an invigorating clip and pretty soon you've spent hours having a riotously rewarding time.

The world of Pandora has a dusty, run-down feel, yet it manages to be vibrant and eye-catching at the same time. The art style features black-line borders and a colorful palette that give the game a not-quite-comic, not-quite-cel-shaded look. It takes some getting used to, and its technical execution is less-than-perfect . Yet what Borderlands lacks in precision it more than makes up for in style, and hours into the game you'll still be appreciating the thoughtful design touches that bring this world to life. Though the different environments occasionally feel too similar, there is enough distinct detail to keep them from blurring together. Your vanquished enemies also do their part to keep things visually interesting by dying in a variety of gruesome and entertaining ways. Bodies explode, limbs fly off, and burning enemies occasionally disintegrate from the ground up until only the mask of their face is left hanging in midair. It sounds (and is a bit) horrifying, but when the mask drops comically to the floor and finally burns up, don't bother stifling that chuckle. The art design resonates well with Borderlands' irreverent sense of humor, and the game is playful without feeling too goofy.

You travel through this world as one of four characters, each with a unique look and attitude. You don't really get to appreciate the character designs if you play solo because you have no AI teammates, but you do hear frequent quips that give you a little bit of character-specific flavor. The most important difference between characters is the action skill, which is a special ability that can give you an edge in combat. The Hunter can release a vicious bird of prey, the Soldier can throw down an automatic turret flanked by shields, the Siren can turn invisible and speedy, damaging all enemies in the vicinity, and the Berserker flies into a damage-resistant rage and delivers brutal punches to his enemies. You unlock these abilities after playing for a short while, and not only are they all fun to use, but each one can be customized in a couple of strategically distinct ways. You can tweak and upgrade your ability by investing skill points in appropriate skills. So, for example, upgrading the Hunter's bird of prey not only can increase the amount of damage it does, but can make it attack multiple targets, steal health from them, slow them down for easy sniping, and cause them to drop more loot. Expanding your action skill makes you more deadly in combat, and it's one of the most rewarding parts of leveling up. Killing enemies, finishing quests, and completing in-game bonus challenges earn you experience points, which in turn earn you a new level. Leveling up boosts your overall fortitude and grants you a precious skill point to use however you see fit.

You can also spend your skill points on other improvements, and each character has three different skill trees that highlight different tactics and abilities. So the Soldier can essentially become the team medic by developing the skills that allow him to shoot teammates to regenerate their health and that make his turret create a healing radius. Or he could choose to become more deadly, increasing his turret damage and combat rifle performance. Though your weapon proficiency improves based on how much you use a given weapon type, different characters have skills that favor different types of guns, so it's to your advantage to play to your character's strengths. The Berserker can certainly become proficient with the sniper rifle, but his melee-focused action skill and preference for rocket launchers make him a better choice for wading into the fray. Though the branching skill trees offer intriguing ways to specialize, your initial character choice has the biggest impact on how you'll go through the game. Fortunately, each character is fun and deadly in his own way, so you can't choose poorly, and you'll probably want to experience what each one has to offer. Playing cooperatively allows you to enjoy and benefit from the other characters' abilities, something you don't get to appreciate when playing solo, unless you start a new game.

Expanding your abilities and leveling up is one of the main ways that Borderlands consistently rewards you. Loot is another. Loot can be found in containers, dropped by enemies, or given to you as a quest reward. It includes money, ammo, shields, mods that boost and alter your grenades, mods that boost your skills, and, of course, guns. Guns are classified in familiar categories: pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, combat rifles, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, and so on. Each class feels distinct, and the shooting mechanics are well tuned and satisfying, which makes it fun to blast baddies. Base damage, clip size, fire rate, accuracy, and bullet spread are just some of the variables within each class, and some guns have more exotic features, like bladed pistols that increase melee damage or a shotgun that also shoots rockets. They can also do elemental damage, which comes in a variety of flavors that put a special kind of hurt on and can even do damage over time. Equip an incendiary gun if you want to burn flesh, or a corrosive gun if you want to deal extra damage to creatures with tough hides.

The Good
    Satisfying gunplay
    Tons of weapons, shields, and helpful items
    Four unique and equally fun-to-play characters
    Distinct, appealing artistic style
    Great system of rewards

The Bad
    Lonelier, slower-paced for a solo player
    Massively unsatisfying
    Lackluster loot sharing system

8.5/10"
9803,a compelling story about a guy with 3 balls and a little robot reminiscent of R2D2
9804,amazing game 10/10

"
9806,awesome game!

9810,"The worst in the series in my opinion, but a fantastic game nonetheless. 7.5/10"
9811,I'm playing this in 2014 and is totally worth it. Get the GOTY tho. Finishing this then starting Borderlands 2
9812,"This game has 17.75 million guns, how could you not like this? Plus you can fight a monster, WITH TENTICLES! This is the only game with this ammount of guns. I dont mean it has the most guns in anhy game, but it might. 10/10"
9813,"There is nothing more amazing than the lighthearted pleasure of setting a half-naked psychopath on fire with a sniper rifle while screaming the chorus for ""Light My Fire"" in the middle of the night.

Get this game."
9814,awesome game i have been playing it sence release i started on ps3 have now moved to pc if u love loot and shoot games this is the game for you
9815,Funnest Game ive ever played dude.
9816,Ain't No Rest For The Wicked!
9817,"A bit out-dated graphics wise but still has solid gameplay. General Knoxx DLC adds hours of farming in the Armory or Borderlands first raid boss, Crawmerax. Buy this."
9818,I had this game on PS3 many years ago and it was an amazing game i put countless hours into it. I bought it on PC for the DLC and the the hope that people still played online (They dont its desolate). I missed many things from B2. If you have not played either Borderlands games i do recommend this if your looking for a nostalgia trip you wont find it
9819,"I find this game to be good christian fun for boys and girls,even the little baby Jesus would enjoy it.Remember kids,Jesus loves you even if No one else does.Well,maybe he only likes you."
9820,Game is kinda buggy. Like the damage of the guns. and the balance of the levels. still fun game!
9821,"I'm writing this review after having beaten the game on PS3 at least 6 times and having beaten Borderlands 2 4 times and the Presequel once. I've played through all of the games in Spanish at least once; the voice acting is superb in both the English and Spanish versions (at least in Borderlands 1 what dialogue there is is good).

Borderlands--an immensely fun and addicting fps with rpg elements--is like a bag of mixed candies which consists of mostly good, enjoyable elements but contains some less than stellar ones as well. 

First, the bad:
The intro sequence of quests really drags on and takes a bit to get into the game; at least on PC loading screens are much faster so the awkward space between some beginning quests in which you have to travel to more than one area before you can do anything else aren't as bad. 
The atmosphere of the game can have at times a really hazy, dulled feeling which is both good and bad in that it successfully emulates what the climate might be like and helps immerse the player.
Some quests are repetitive.
Character Development is pretty absent with a few exceptions
Some of the weapons don't handle well, but that's not so much of a problem as there are so many freakin weapons
Interface on the PC version is kind of klunky and annoying

The Good:
SO MANY WEAPONS. While the styles aren't as varied as in the two games that come after, the game's tremendous combinatorial weapon generation yields a huge variety of loot that motivates continued gameplay.
The environments. Pandora is this huge, (mostly) wasteland planet. The environments, monsters, and other baddies that fill them are highly rememberable.
Questlines. The quests are arrranged in a manner that doesn't feel linear in a bad way. Routes abound for completing things in a manner that pleases you.
Skills/skill trees.
Weapon proficiencies. This is a feature that I thought was really great when I first played the game many years back.
Humor. The borderlands universe has a great sense of humor. Love it.
CO OP is helpful but not essential. The nature of the game is conducive to having other friends with you through the journey.
Unique Graphical Style

I'm sleepy and going to wrap this up, but I HIGHLY recommend you buy/play/consider playing/buying at least this game and the Second.
Countless hours of enjoyment for myself and friends whom I've played it with.
Definitely worth whatever you pay for it."
9822,"Best game I have played, cartoony graphics make it much more fun and just all around entertaining... all in all this game is the best shooter out there"
9823,FUCK YEAH. I just got level 30 in destiny and only played this game for 3 hours.. got bored of destiny so I needed a new RPG where there was FUCKING TRADING. thank you borderlands.
9824,fantastic game played this on console good graphics played it on pc .. never looked so good! this game is top of the best shooters of all time
9825,"When this game originally came out, I didnt believe the hype. I was, for the most part, wrong. Even 5 years later, the game is still a great time, both solo and with friends. Sure the original final boss wasnt what you hoped, but the Characters are great, the story was well defined and the loot was every thing you could ask for a gun totting pyscho."
9826,I loved everything about this game except one.  My avatar did'nt feel like they were running. It seems like your legs are taped together and you shuffle along. Makes getting from one place to another take longer than it should. Wish they could have put the fast running like Farcry 4 has in it.
9827,"Got attacked by a small doge creature and died. 
11/10"
9828,"Got this game way before it became available on Steam so I have a few hundred hours under my belt. 

On to the review! This is one of the best games I've ever played. It takes the best bits of a fast-paced FPS and combines it with character-building in the style of Diablo II, Torchlight and so forth. Combine that with dark humor in the style of Quentin Tarantino and cell-shaded graphics and you've got a winning concept. The game is easy to learn, but hard to master. In my book, this game is only surpassed by Borderlands II.

+ Easy to get into
+ Graphics are easy on the eyes
+ Extensive random generation of loot
+ Diablo II, in space, with guns
+ Well written story
+ Hilarious co-op in multiplayer

- Hitboxes are sometimes inconsistent with graphics
- Some slight balance issues between classes and weapons"
9829,I like this game. I can play this game over and over. This is an very outstanding game. i recommend this to all others.
9830,Played It on the 360 Loved it love it even more on the PC ^.^
9831,"Si j'ai joué à Borderlands 2 avant celui-ci, je ne m'attendais pas à grand chose si ce n'est un point de départ scénaristique. J'étais dans l'erreur! Borderlands premier du nom est bien un petit bijoux d'originalité qui pose les bases d'un système de jeu très addictif et bien ficelé. Il est certes perfectible et à été perfectionné dans le second épisode, mais le fun est au rendez-vous. Ce jeu a du cachet et beaucoup de personnalité. A faire absolument si vous êtes fan de RPG shooter!

Comme tous les borderlands, les dlc me semblent indispensables pour compléter l'expérience de jeu. Comme il n'y a plus d'extension qui sortiront, on peut considérer que le jeu est complet!

Une expérience à vivre et vive Pandora!"
9832,Good.
9833,I do not recommend if you have already played Borderland 2.
9834,"First person diablo-like shooter. Tons of loot. Great artstyle and humor. Hours and hours of sidequests. Also, 4 DLC packs that don't suck!"
9835,Amazing game I love it!
9836,"Borderlands takes a lot of time to get into before it becomes fun, but once you're about 1/3 through the game, it's mind-blowingly awesome. I love the graphics, gameplay, humor, and pretty much everything else besides the ending."
9837,I deffinately recommend this game! it had so much replay value and the story and style are great too!
9838,"this game to my close friends and me  means childhood. Great coop , lots of guns , well desing world , and is fun as fuck.The rating is 9/10 has some minor bad things but is not enough to ruin the experience."
9839,"[b]Warning: if you're new to the Borderlands series, disregard this review and get the GOTY edition of this game, as you probably won't get frustrated by the amount of flaws present in this game that were fixed in Borderlands 2.

[h1]SCORE[/h1]
Gameplay ★★★★★☆
Story ★★★☆☆
Graphics ★★☆☆☆
Soundtrack ★★★☆☆


[h1]PROS[/h1]
[olist]
	[*]Way harder than Borderlands 2, so you won't need to replay the main story twice to get to the ""REAL REAL game""
	[*]You get to play as the original vault hunters, and therefore you get to use Brick's fists, Roland's scorpion turret, Mordecai's Bloodwing and Lilith's phasewalk
	[*]You get to see Fyrestone, New Haven and plenty of more locations that are unavailable/abandoned in Borderlands 2
	[*]You get to see the birth (aka ""where the hell did they come from"") characters such as Marcus, Tannis, Zed, Moxxi, Scooter, Grilled Earl, Helena Pierce... and the original Crimson Lance
	[*]Way more serious than Borderlands 2... no dank memes/LOL SO RANDUMB XD/SJW BS courtesy of Anthony ""Mangina"" Burch
[/olist]


[h1]CONS[/h1]
[list]
	[*]The user interface is as friendly as a rabid skag... ugly and useless are gentle words to describe it
	[*]No mini-map on screen, so prepare to press M all the time until you get familiar with locations, because the compass isn't any trustworthy
	[*]You don't automatically pick up health/money/ammo
	[*]The loot system is the saddest thing since 9/11: you'll get white/green weapons all the time, but blue grenade mods, purple class-mods and legendary relics... it's horribly unbalanced
	[*]Gunplay is meh, most weapons have the same look and feel and overall aren't pleasant to use
	[*]Reloading is painfully slow until you reach lvl10 proficiency with that kind of weapon
	[*]RPGs are WAY too weak but WAY too accurate; so accurate they don't even have a damage radius, you either hit the target in one shot or it's like nothing ever happened, even if the rocket explodes behind the enemy
	[*]Manufacturers are pretty much meaningless here: Torgue's aren't always explosive, Tediore's aren't thrown on reload, Dahl's don't shoot in burst mode under iron sights, Vladof's fire rates aren't that good (in fact their sniper rifles suck), Maliwan's don't excel for elemental damage and Jakobs don't shoot ""as fast as you can pull the trigger""
	[*]The comparing system is almost hidden, so comparing loot is more like a tedious chore rather than something you can do on-the-go
	[*]You can't move while in Fight For Your Life and enemies will run away after downing you... lovely combo
	[*]Weapons are so meh, you won't really feel more powerful as you level up (example - lvl 10 grenade mod: 40 damage, lvl 35 grenade mod: 70 damage)
	[*]No FOV slider, you'll need to install a third-party tool so you don't feel like a turtle when you run
	[*]Say you need to collect 5 echo recordings in a certain area; well, there will be no [url=http://i.ytimg.com/vi/x7rL1EO1-Xs/hqdefault.jpg]mission area marker[/url], just a single mission marker in your map. Good luck finding the echos
	[*]Buying ammo is a chore, as you need to confirm the purchase of every single cartridge, and you have to memorize the icons so you know what to buy
	[*]Creating a co-op party is almost confusing, and you have to choose your character every single time if you don't wanna join the game with a lvl 1 Roland
	[*]No ""!"" sign on NPCs with available missions, so prepare to listen to Claptrap ALL the time: ""Greetings! There are new missions available on New Haven's bounty board"" until you accept them
	[*]Elemental weapons are too rare (I didn't get the ""kill 25 enemies with corrosive weapons"" achievement until I was lvl 25, go figure), so most of the time you'll be playing with dull, non-elemental weapons
	[*]Vehicles are WAY too powerful... you can just run over badass enemies to avoid killing them
	[*]There's NO way to tell main missions from side-missions, and sometimes you have to complete a set of tedious side-missions in order to unlock the next main mission
[/list]


[h1]NOTES[/h1]
[list]
	[*]Controls are customizable, you can use the arrows instead of WASD, Enter instead of E, Backspace instead of R
	[*]Just in case I wasn't clear enough: DON'T bother buying this if you've already played Borderlands 2

9843,One of the best !
9844,Great game geting ready to buy the second one
9845,"Let me start out by saying that I do not like shooters.  1st person, 3rd person, or whatever.  I have never liked shooters.  My son came to visit and brought his Xbox 360 and he said he had a game that if I would give it a chance, he was sure I would like it at least enough to play with him when he came to visit.  When he loaded up Borderlands, my first reaction was ""Oh God!  A Shooter.""  I reminded him that I didn't like this kind of game at all.  He talked me into trying.  He suggested that I play Mordecai.  To make a long story short, within an hour I was so hooked I lost all track of time.  Between the pop culture knods and puns from my era (the story writers have GOT to be close to my age... which we won't mention what is) and the shere enjoyment of the game itself, it felt like we had only played an hour or so and I looked at the clock and it was 7 hours later!  I went on to play the 2nd AND the presequel!  I am still not very big on shooters, but I am at least a little more open to them because of this game and my son's persistance.  Borderlands have you laughing hard one second and then wondering ""what the heck!?"" the next.  The story is extremely engrossing, and the characters very relatable in their actions and motivations.  When you get to the end (is there actually and end??)  You will feel like you have acomplished the unachievable.  If you are even looking at this game and wondering, I have only two words:  ""BUY IT!""  Whatever genre is your preference, you will fall in love with it!"
9846,"Although I am biased in the fact that it was the first game I played that did not involve racing or mindless zombie shooting, Borderlands is the number one game in my heart. I love everything about it, from its rough-around-the-edges visual style to its witty and often nonsensical dialogue to its killer soundtrack. The playable characters are so carefully constructed that you forgo class for personality and their particular background and skills provide a completely different experience on each playthrough. The NPCs grow on you like weeds and you find yourself hesitating to shoot enemies just because they look so cool. The gameplay is very straightforward and the RPG elements not at all off-putting for those averse to the genre. More importantly, despite making for an amazing single player experience, it’s co-op that really takes the cake. I cannot possibly express how fun the Borderlands game series are when played with your best friend so I can only urge you to try it. Now."
9847,"Borderlands was the best co-op experience ever. I had so much fun playing this game, the jokes and humor were hilarious. The story was engaging and the developers put so much thought into how you did things, it made it you want to keep playing. The little side quests were engaging and kept the passion of the game alive. The guns were amazing, they put so much into the detail of them even with a toon line effect on top. Overall this game was amazing and I would recommend to anyone. Single or co-op this game is awesome :D"
9848,"Doesn't matter which class you choose or which gun you use, you are the ultimate badass on Pandora. (Or anywhere in the galaxy for that matter.)"

Sale Rate: 60%

Total: 6.5/10

Graphics: 2.5/3
Have you ever read a comic and thought the hero should have shot the guy in the face? See the cap crusader punch a guy without his head exploding? Well, shut up Batman and move aside to Brick, the face exploding punching rage machine. 

The game’s style is based on comic book shadows and details. It gives it a more of a timeless look compared to more high-def. games. Using this style, the game acts like a Dead Pool just killing and not giving a shit for the entire ride. The graphics add to the game giving it both lasting power and a fully functional setting.  

Story: 1.5/3
Do you like space westerns? Do you miss Firefly? Do you think its cancelation was bullshit? Well this is not Firefly, but is still a space Western. 

The game centers around a myth of the Vault, the greatest trove of weapons, money and women in the galaxy. You are a vault hunter, you hunt vaults. This vault is the biggest vault that must be hunted, and you always get your vault, no matter the road blocks in your way. 

During you vault hunt you find several people who will help you hunt your vault, and many more who will try to stop your vault hunt. Some have fun dialog and a handful will stick in the back of your head until you die, for real. Fun dialog and no actual story makes this a fun game.

Game Play: 2/3
This was the first game that mixed tight combat with a progression system that changes the core game with each level. Most of the levels only add slight passives until you hit a game changer. Each class plays extremely differently from each other and the game supports all of them evenly until you play online where you can only play as the Siren or be left behind. 

The combat is based on Team Fortress 2 and confused level scaling. All the enemies have a large amount of health requiring shooting them in the face, again and again and again. If you start a quest that is two level above you, you will die. Every level matters not for the increase in health, but the scaling damage and damage resist is the difference between walking through as Chuck Norris and running through as Labuff. 

As the game progresses the combat gets stale since the enemies don’t get hard through complexity but through health. It takes about 30 seconds to kill the first boss, and 5 minutes to kill the final. This would not be bad if your survival time also increased, but it goes down as the game progresses. 

Re-Playability: .5/1
The game has a new game plus and multiple unique playable characters. It is worth a play through for the fun ones.

Should you buy it?
It’s an old game that is not going anywhere soon. By on a heavy sale."
9850,"My first open world type game that would run on my hardware (admittedly it's not actually mine; thanks, Grandma and Grandpa for letting me borrow your laptop!), and I am falling in love with this genre and the art style. The humor is a little low brow / ""random"" for my taste, but it also has some serious ideas in it. And this is an hour in. In short, I freaking love this game."
9851,"An amazing game! clocked in hundreds of hours in on the xbox 360 and loved it. if you have friends it makes it even better, if you have not pick this game up!

9852,"Dark humor, cheap plastic sound effects, pretty rad weapon system, unique and iconic locations, characters ranging from badass to nuts and a wide variety inbetween

Id be lying if I said that I found even a single rocket launcher useful, but god damn if it wasnt still fun to use.

This is the quintecential alien-wasteland shooter, something that unfortunately was not carried into the second installment (Probably cut to make more room for injokes, references, and memes. Well, it worked for Nukem: Forever--... Right?)
This game holds my favorite level series in almost any video game, Fort Knoxx. Partially due to its pitched vehical battles, sweet jumps, and blatant boss advertising; is a game I often go back to with friends jus to shoot the shit (and talk also :P)

Grab a couple friends, throw some music on, have a great time~"
9853,"Funny, good storyline, fun gameplay (eventually gets a little repetitive) but solid first person shooter with interesting animated scenery"
9854,"This one is an oddball. I bought it, turned it on and said to myself - oh bummer, what a shitty graphic, the steering, handling, oh boy - this will be a nightmare...

Currently i have over ~30h of gameplay, 2 characters ~32 lvl and i must admit i was wrong.
The game is really brilliant. it will literally suck You in. Just give it some time at the beginning and you will feel the magic.

Brilliant, humorous and really enjoyable. Recommend to anyone who likes action shooters and some RPG basics."
9855,"Awesome game. Pretty cheap. I've spent around 70 hours on it at the time of writing, and I purchased it, and all it's DLC for ten dollars. Great buy, however, Borderlands 2 is superior."

9862,"This game is spectacularly fun ! Sure it is a bit undercooked when it comes to technical features such as graphic settings and the cursed unskippable loud intros, but that's all well compensated for with the stability of the multiplayer gameplay ! I finished this game with my best friend and guess what: We had a blast ! 
The game barely lags, and the whole multiplayer system is clever- no need for a centralized host -making lag nearly absent, and rendering the whole setup phase very simple with the lobby concept.
Borderlands offers a very interactive experience, the more you achieve in it the more challenges the game will offer. I think if I want to summerize the whole experience, I'd say it's very dynamic towards the player(s). However, just to warn you: This game is infected with the DLC virus !
 So overall, either you're diving solo or with company in the vault hunt, I can guarantee that as long as you can overlook some technical flaws and occasional glitching and be patient about solving them, you can have a kick out of this game. As for the multiplayer: The more the merrier !"
9863,At first playig this game it puts you in a sense of security that you're going to die A LOT...like you have no fighting chance BUT after I hit level 16ish the game became easy...I honestly don't know if I recommend this and this game has the WORST controls I've ever played...major sensitivity spikes
9864,"Enjoyable single/coop experience with some RPG mechanics.  The versus multiplayer was quite generic though.

Recommend for a single playthrough coop experience.

9865,"The first of a great (Other than The Pre Sequel) series, both BL and BL2 offer hrs of great gaming."
9866,"This game, over Steam and console, has stolen 100+ hours of my life. And I don't want them back."
9867,"The game that started it all. It feels trippy playing this because of how different the interface is from Pre-Sequel and Bl2, they've definitely come along way aesthetically, functionally, and feature wise. The original vault hunters we all know and love are playable classes in Bl1, and it's definitely one of the best FPS's I've ever played. The storyline is witty and entertaining, and this game and it's descendents are definitely worth every penny."
9868,"First i was like omg another open world game bla bla bla, but then GOTY came out and i was like yeah why not. Now i have like 42h played and still playing this shit xd"
9869,"I was stupid for ignoring this game from the day it comed out only coz bad graphic style. Its epic fps rpg game one of a kind do not fucking miss this game its amazing fun!

Cheeki Breeki!"
9870,"Retrospect is a strange thing, especially considering the sequel and the mess that is the pre-sequel. Borderlands is a game that built its atmosphere above its story, along with its main premise of randomly generated guns. Guns were reused and mostly reskinned, fine enough, but at least guns didn't noticeably clip through each other (like the sequel with hyperion's guns, that shiz was ridiculous).

Storyline is fairly minimal, it may not be as engaging as the sequel due to characters' conversations be mostly text, but this game is pretty decent, it's not great, it's grindy at times, and padded in the DLC, but it's fun.

The two reasons that I would say the original did better than its sequel #1. it has brick, #2. It has more guns.

what madness is this?! how could an inferior prequel have more guns than its sequels?! Let's deconstruct the gun counts based on brand per game based off the types of guns **not** made by certain brands.:

**''Borderlands''**
Jakobs - SMG, Pistols, Rocket Launcher, Assault Rifle
Dahl - None
Hyperion - Revolver(?)
Torgue -  Revolver(?)
Tediore - None
Maliwan - Assault Rifle(?)
Vladof -  Revolver, SMG(?)
S&S - Revolver, Rocket Launcher(?)
Atlas - None (not completely sure)

**''Borderlands  2''**
Bandit- Sniper Rifle, revolver
Jakobs - Rocket Launcher
Dahl - Rocket Launcher, Shotgun
Hyperion - Assault Rifle, Rocket Launcher
Torgue - Sniper RIfle,SMG
Tediore - Sniper RIfle
Maliwan - Shotgun, Assault Rifle
Vladof -  Shotgun, SMG

the gun type difference may be 2 to the estimated 13 of the sequel compared to the original's 11,  sounds small? well when you take the context of ""gorillions of guns"" and then note that burst fire, corkscrew shot, split shot, and gyrojets were not brand-limited features in classic borderlands, well little things add up fast. Less is more? hardly.

if you want mindless shooty fun, go for borderlands!"
9871,Good start to series
9872,Great game. By far the best in the series
9873,"I've barely played two hours, but I can say that this game lives up to the hype that I was hearing from people. The graphics are excellent and so far I like the story, as well. The whole interface is easy to use. Plus it's just a lot of fun."
9874,"My credit card won't stop crying, but yeah, it's awesome."
9875,Perfection! I wish I had the time to play this with my cousin.
9876,"Awesome story, awesome gameplayer, AWESOME GAME, love all the bordelands series <3"
9877,Diablo loot+First person shooter+rpg mechanics=FUN FOREVER
9878,"Been playing it for a few years and this game never gets boring! Borderlands have a unique content generation system that  allows infinite weapon variations, the co-op experience is just great, with you and your friends you just enjoy the game while everyone gets better items and harder monsters! 10/10 will play again."
9879,So much fun to play this game. Love that it's multiplayer! A little glitchy but it's funny most of the time. I think everyone should play this game at least once.
9880,Pound the flesh!!! The meat puppet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

9884,"My review may be late by alot but it still stands.

    Borderlands was a game in it's own class for a while but people took notice and started to copy a large amout of the style  in their own games. This is largely casued by the cult like following it has earned since it's relase back in 2009. One can not anymore expect orginal gameplay because it has been copyed by other devs, but there is little point in me beating the dead horse on this.

   The place Borderlands falls short is the main game's story it is slow at times and the dialogue is dry a good portion of the time. This is not ture for the dlc as they took a less serious tone and made fun of some of the games short comings. (If you only buy one dlc for this game the best for an all around good time is ""The Secret Armory of General Knoxx"" it adds 19 levels to the cap of 50 making 69 along with new loot.)

 To end my review I would like to state to those of you whom hate dlc and say it is just a cash grab. The dlc for this game came after it was demaned by the fanbase. Futher proof of this was the first big update for this game was a hookin system so the dlc could load in to the game.

 *Please forgive the run-on sentence and other grammatical errors in my review."
9885,"If you like this then download Borderlands 2, evrything slightly off in this game is fixed in that. Awesome!"
9886,yaaa
9887,"This game makes the player feel like they are always underpowered which is the most unfun experience you can have in a game. It says something about a game when you have played over 50 hours on both games (Non-Steam & Steam) and the most fun you've had on both was fucking around ramming cars into each other. The game constantly spouts dank maymays in your face trying to make you laugh but at the end of the day it's just an excuse for poor writing. This game gets credit for being ""good"" yet it does the exact same stuff as Destiny which gets negative reviews. The only difference this has ""le cl4p tr4p xD"".

Doesn't Interest Me/10"
9888,"First impressions are the best impressions, and I'm relatively unimpressed. Nothing feels organinc, and so far, the quests seems to be 'run here and kill X amount of Y's.' I don't feel invested into any characters, nor care for their well being. It's a completely dull game and a bore. I won't be getting into this anytime soon."
9889,"Now with SteamWork multiplayer!

It's a great time to go back in with Friends !

9890,"Got wrecked by a badass flaming skag. Came back 2 levels higher and still got wrecked. More fun with other players, but still a little bland. 6/10"
9891,"This game is an MMO but designed for 4 players. The main draw is looting weapons. All the weapons found looting will have different stats and different elemental effects and so on. 

And like any MMO there really is no plot. There are a bunch of characters but no real story. And seriously, fuck the Claptrap. He is not funny and his voice makes me want to kill myself. Art style is what it is. A kind of cel shaded look. You either love it or not. I don't like it. The blurry textures combined with low FOV and head bobbing when moving around makes my stomach churn.

You cannot play this game in singleplayer. It is unplayably boring in singleplayer. Play co-op or don't."
9892,"I love it.
Playing the borderlands first game Was way better than the Second one.
Probably because of the new guns,missons and maps.

But there is a problem with the game.
Bosses.
They are so easy. I killed all of the bosses (Except for the last one) With one rage only (Beserker)

9902,"When I used to play on my Xbox 360, I remember the fun times I had. Whether I was playing Halo 3's limitless custom games, or Battlefield Bad Company 2 with my friend Stevokiller (he converted to the Master Race a year in advance of me) I had a great time. When Borderlands came out, I did not know what to make of it. I had no clue about it, or what it was. So, when I got it as a Christmas gift I decided to give it a try. I must say, I am happy that I played it. Borderlands is one of the best games I had ever played on my Xbox 360, and it is in my Top 10 games of all time as well (it is at number nine). Every DLC story was hilarious and amazing, though I cannot say the same for Claptrap Revolution (never was able to play it). I think the game is a little to expensive, since it is a little over four years old now. Still a great game. Tons of loot, laughs, and adventures to be had. Get it and play it with competant friends. I give this game a 9.7/10 on sale, and a 9.2/10 for its asking price as of 1/27/2015."
9903,"Borderlands is an incredibly fun game with a great atmosphere. 

Starting the game and getting into the groove seems a little slow at first, but once you get the hang of the game and begin to understand the mechanics better, the world is your oyster. The story ending is a bit anticlimactic, but for an open world game, it isn't too terrible. The game also follows an odd difficulty pattern, and it is VERY highly recommended that a player do side missions and explore to not only increase their level but to acquire better weaponry. Just simply blitzing through the story while ignoring everything else is then going to be extremely difficult, something many players dislike. The game does evolve as you continue through the game however in terms of ambiance. The characters get a bit quirkier, you see more tough enemies (badass, bad mutha) pop up, and each area is for the most part very unique. Overall a great game to play.

When it comes to DLCs, this game had some good and bad. The good? Dr. Ned's Zombie Island, Secret Armory of Gen. Knox, and Claptrap's New Robot Revolution are all great and add tons of content with a great story for each. It is with these that I think the devs realized what they were trying to go for in terms of humor and gameplay. Easter eggs and pop culture/gaming references were everywhere by CNRR, but it still felt like vanilla Borderlands in a good way of course. Mad Moxxi's Underdome on the other hand was a massive waste of time. The only new areas really were this small room where you can choose one of the three arenas to fight in, and the three arenas themselves. Together they were about the size of one of the smallest areas of the other DLCs. What made it even worse is NO EXPERIENCE IS GIVEN IN THE ARENA BATTLES. That's right. No XP. Very little (and crap) loot, zero xp, and it takes 45 minutes of continuous gameplay to finish 5 rounds of 5 waves in each arena. Horrible. Unless you have a thing for arena fighting or are a masochistic achievement hunter like myself, just skip it.

What an amazing game. At the time of this review, i collected 60 hours of gameplay, and still going on.
And this is with a single character.
If you own the DLCs, which you should cause Knoxx alone is worth the Goty edition of this game, there is an ""ideal playthrough"" you are recemmended to follow if it's the first time you play this.
That's because one of the flaws of the title is the difficulty level...it's not bad itself, but it can become an issue if you start doing all the side missions on the wrong time...it's too long and complicated to explain in detail, so i advice you to just google ""borderlands ideal playthrough"", and you should reach a page on a forum explaining everything worth to know.
Believe me, it's important, i wouldn't have spent time writing this in the review...cause i think it's basically the only true way to enjoy this gem.

Graphics: i played it in 2014-2015, and still appreciated it, the cartoonish feeling and the design too. 
Sound: nice, i liked the acting too.
Story: not bad, but this is not what the game relies on.
Gameplay: outstanding, the feeling with weapons is great, and the loot is fantastic. Can be challenging.
Longevity: important parameter imo, here we have an awesome amount of hours to play, especially if you follow the idel playthrough i've mentioned about above."
9905,"This game is just awesome. No other way to say it. There is always something to do it seems. Once you have all the characters max lvl and killed kramerax countless times and beaten Moxxi's Underdome, then you will probably start another character just to do t again like I did."
9906,Just yes. This game is PERFUKT.
9907,I once ran over a Rakk whilst driving in mid-air.
9908,Incredibly fun; I love the art work; gets a bit repetitive
9909,You carry hundreds of guns and you only use two.
9910,Best game i ever played!
9911,Hi Mom!
9912,Best Borderlands game made. Everything newer can not even come close to the natural feeling of this game.
9913,"Great story, fun combat, runs smoothly on all computers, Guns, first area is boring."
9914,What's all the hype about the 2nd game?
9915,"Great Game. Funny and bright. 
10/10 if played with friends."
9916,One of the best games of all time.
9917,"To start off I am happy to say all the terrible port issuses have been fixed since lanch and the gamespy crap is sorted and online works fine now

So it may sound a bit off but I like Borderlands  more then the second one i'm not to sure but i feel like BL2 is just to silly and is trying to be to crazy and BL1 is more straight forward 

This game has a pretty cool look to it and its gunplay is damn good, driving sucks but that is every gearbox game 

the missons are not to repetitive but they can run a little to long sometime 

over all this is a great fps action rpg and worth your time and money , maybe even more then the second  

8/10 a good fun time"
9918,"A fast paced FPS with RPG elements and randomized loot.  This game reaches out to many different types of players.  I'm usually not a fan of cell shaded video games, but the gameplay was attractive enough to keep me playing.  It has a pretty good degree of replayability as well with multiple characters to choose from that add a good variety."
9919,"Athough it's very easy to forget about the (at times) unengaging storyline, boarderlands is a great game to just zone out and play. The atmosphere is relaxing in conjunction with the soundtrack, simple UI, and fantastic gameplay with more guns than your could ever hope for. The best thing about the game is that once you beat it, you can replay again with keeping your level, skills, and equipment. 9/10"
9920,"A sleeper hit, Borderlands quickly became a very popular game, and franchise within the Gearbox Software company. I bought this game by accident when it first came out, and it was the best mistake I have ever made. I have logged in over months and months of play time on Borderlands and I never grow tired of it. An RPG/FPS game that has a gazillion guns just laying around for your picking. Graphically, it may not be the best, but it's still done beautifuly. The watered-down, almost comic, style of art gave it more of a feel, or depth. Four characters to choose from, a class to suffice even the pickiest of gamers, including a Berserker who later becomes a tank, who you don't want to make mad. A soldier with a deployable turret, an 'angel' that can teleport through different dimensions just to run/move faster, and a hunter who goes looking for the biggest reward, with his trusty side-kick, Bloodwing, beside him.
There are many, many easter eggs for other games, movies, pop culture, pretty much everything has a hand in this game, and it is put together well, including 'A Christmas Story', 'Mad Maxx', 'Godzilla', and the list goes on.
Each class offers different bonuses that can pertain to only them, but most do extend to helping out your allies. This game is a must for anyone that has friends over and you are just looking to have an awesome time and have fun, because this game is never short of a pervy joke. Guns, guts, and glory. All for you."
9921,Fun comic graphics that don't interfere with the fast paced shooter gameplay. Plenty of satire to boot. One of my favourite games of all time.
9922,Probably the best game I've ever played lol. I started playing this on xbox when it came out and I'm still having fun with it!
9923,"The Original badlands is quite possible the best in the whole series. Tons of explosions, bullets, more explosions, more guns, and stuff. 10/10 would play for 85 hours again."
9924,"Love this game that started it all, I'm revisting it now and loving it.  My first experience with this was on the Xbox 360 and I'm loving the better graphics and smoother play on the PC."
9925,i legitimately spent 10 straight hours playing the other day 10/10
9926,"[h1]Great...For Its Time[/h1]

Considering the release date (2009), I imagine this game was top-tier for its time. Borderlands is unique, it's funny, it's got balanced classes, and a great new mix of FPS-RPG. It was fresh...in 2009-2011. However, I can't recommend this game to players who are used to the streamlined gameplay mechanics and witty dialogue that its successors possess. I tried picking this up three times. It's very hard to get into after playing Borderlands 2. Unless you're a masochist...or a really dedicated fan of the series and wanna finish it just to say you did.

There are a lot of flaws in this installment that was addressed in the latter games. For instance, you're given quests to do only to run all the way back to turn in and fetch another quest—and tedious sidequests are mandatory if you don't wanna insta-die to mobs three levels higher than you. But if the mobs are one level higher, they're suddenly no match for you (doesn't make sense). For a game that's supposed to be open world, it plays very linear. Many quests are hard in the worst possible way: mobs are difficult—not because they have challenging mechanics—but because they come in swarms and they have massive health pools. That gets boring really fast. There is no ammo sharing, you have to manually pick up eeeeverything, no mini-map (you have an incomprehensibly broken compass), and there are rarely any voice-overs. The world feels as bland and lifeless as its sidequests—don't expect the vibrancy of Pandora that we see in Borderlands 2 to be here. It ain't there.

For its time, it was brilliant and fresh. For now, where quests no longer feel like chores, it's deeply flawed. I see why some fans of this game don't like Borderlands 2—it's sillier and full of memes and pop culture references (which I enjoy). It's rough around the edges but I'm glad I played this because I appreciate the sequels that much more.

If I played it first, 8/10. But I didn't so—4/10 (I'm sorry ;~;)."
9927,This game is great!
9928,"This game is extremely fun, whether by yourself or with a party. The writing, both plotwise and dialogue, is more serious than in the sequel. There are a few chuckle-worthy moments but nothing like the internet-meme, pop culture references galore approach you get later in the series. Not that there's anything wrong with that. When I came back to replay this game after BL2 I was a little surprised to find that Claptrap had originally been so staid. The character has been so Flanderized that I actually forgot his character hadn't always been the way he is now.

Game's still fun but I'd have to say that compared to Borderlands 2 everything about this game is ""smaller"". Sort of like the comparison between the original Fallout and Fallout 2. Even if you play Fallout 1 before Fallout 2, after playing Fallout 2 and going back to Fallout 1 you sorta get stuck thinking the first game is still good but it feels a little bare, a little simple now."
9929,Tried to get into this but got bored after a while.  Not a fan of cell shaded games.  The story wasn't interesting.  The environments are mostly barren. Characters are quite sterotypical.   The loot kept me interested for a while but even that faded.
9930,Wondrous.
9931,Awesome Game I think it is a great fps Everyone Should Play It
9932,"awesome,epic,etc."
9933,"I hear this is fun at 4 player co-op, but as I have no friends I was stuck playing the singleplayer campaign, and that blew harder than your wife with her on-and-off again boyfriend from College."
9934,"A solid, clever, but grindy FPS game with some light RPG elements.  The characters and world have lots of personality via the art and sharp dialogue that carry you through the bare bones story.  The Diablo loot grind is strong with this game, as the different weapon types and manufacturers will keep you hunting for that perfect weapon to compliment your character.  The four characters feel somewhat distinct with their skill trees and unique ability, but some skill paths are clearly stronger/more thought out than others.  PvP is essentially non-existant, but the solo/cooperative experience is substancial enough to justify the price.  Repeat playthroughs inject the game with some added difficulty to help with replay, and the DLC will jazz up the core experience substancially.  Would recommend to fans of loot grind games or action RPG games."
9935,9/10 Best game of 2009
9936,tons of monay
9937,"Bought box version of this game years ago. Borderlands Granting Tool out in 2014 - 30hours for DLCs played on Steam. Finally killed Crawmerax, the hardest boss in Borderlands, with Brick  (myself) and Lilith. Got so much epic weapons. Killed my friend on PVP. Got achievements (40 achievements in one moment just from character loading cuz of Granting Tool - ty Gearbox & Valve). 11/10"

9939,Like borderlands 2 but so shit ahahha
9940,The only game where its legal to shoot midgets for sport.
9941,Melhor jogo ever hahaha!!! E tem continuação...
9942,"This game is amazing, simple as that, but let us break it down.

First, I'm going to compare it to the other main installments. While Borderlands 2 did make many improvemnets, Borderlands still manages to hold it's ground, but compared to Borderlands The Pre-Sequel!, it's better. I recomand getting the Game Of The Year edition because it's a good deal. The guns all feel unique, especially the Eridian guns, which pretty much have unlimited ammo. The Pacing for the game is off and needs improvement, but I feel that's intentional as it's present in all the games, it's most likely there so you have time to do side missions, which you really couldn't devote your time to if the story was fast paced, and it also might be there so it feels more like an RPG, which brings me to my next point. I don't like general first person shooters but I like RPG's so this game is perfect for me, as it's an amazing mix of RPG and FPS. Now the characters, each skill tree is unique and some suit better play styles, so I recrommand playing each class so you can get the full feel for the game. Now, this review is way to long, so here's the end."
9943,"FANTASTIC GAME 
1000000 OUT OF 10
                                  -IGN"
9944,"Very fun initially, not much replay value. Would recommend if playing with friends."
9945,what can i say 87 bazillion guns enuf said
9946,"I beat Borderlands on PS3 back when it first launched, and more recently beat it again on Steam. Sure, Gearbox helped push giants gobs of DLC into mainstream, and one could argue that the series has gone a bit stale recently, but for the time, Borderlands was an awesome experience. I have mixed feelings about the DLC, and especially about their weird little ""key"" giveaways, but that doesn't change the original Borderlands being a fun experience.

It's not the most varied game, and by the end of the 20-30 hours of your first playthrough, some parts have gotten a tough tedious. But grab a friend or three, and blast through the hunt for bigger and better weapons. The original is still very much worth a try, but be warned that it's a fraction as enjoyable solo."
9947,Borderlands is great only with mates though if you play this game by yourself you are not doing it right find friends.
9948,Amazing fun specially in coop with friends ;)
9949,"As a PC gamer, I really appreciate the amazingness brought to me from Gearbox Software. This game / title, was the first FPSRPG to be released. I got the best of both worlds in one game! The unique RPG-esque level system, the amazing ""comic-like"" art and animations, the quirky characters, the amassment (""OVER A BAJILLION GUNS!!"" ~A Borderlands Advert) of weapons and items, customizable vehicles (vehicles = if you got the GoTY Ed. vehicle = if you don't.) and outfits, plenty of enemies and creatures to blow away and MUCH, MUUUCH more! So go and buy it! Maybe we can settle the score in Moxxi's Arena ;)"
9950,Great game A+
9951,"One of the greatest games of all times. It's funny yet immersive story, awesome cell-shaded graphics, and all out badass-ity makes this game an instant classic."
9952,Good Game
9953,"Shoot, blow, cut, beat, smash, squeeze, stomp, desintegrate, incinarate, electrocute, fire up, penetrate, splash, drill holes with bullets in bugs, dogs, people, cars and birds... And don't forget to Shoot ofc!"
9954,"Not as good as Borderlands 2. I found it to be kinda boring, just running around collecting stuff, killing people, and thats about it. Not much dialog other then telling you what to do. The world feels very dead. I only bought the GOTY edition for the story line. Its SO boring I've been using a trainer just to finish the game as soon as possible. I'm currently on the quest ""The Next Piece"" ( I think its about 3/4 of the way) and so far all I know is that some people believe in the vault, others don't and all I'm trying to do is use the key to open it. 

Borderlands 2 is such  A BIG improvement that I'm kinda addicted to it, this game just feels like a chore. No wonder I didn't get into Borderlands until now.

The FPS aspect is very good, great weapons, great bosses, interseting enmies (you can't just keep going for headshots)."
9955,"Amazing, I love it!"
9956,"I actually enjoyed playing this game a lot. I loved jokes, graphics, story, characters, etc. But the only thing that ruined the whole picture is ending. I was very dissapointed in it. The feeling of rush and hurry in the last story mission was such a good thing. When you know that the vault could be in hands of bad dudes and you are trying to be the one who stops them and takes the treasure of the vault. The boss which is looking like he is worth killing for the treasure. And in the end he dies and gives you NOTHING. The vault just closes and you are without treasure. Neither a good weapon is dropped, neither a player is happy.

I played the T-Bone Junction DLC after completing the Zombie Island of Dr. Ned which where both very good, but as usual the T-Bone Junction had such a dissapointing ending as I couldn't even imagine.

But even though the ending is not that good, the game still became one of my favourite.

9/10 Psychoes Totally worth buying."
9957,Amazing game.  10/10 would buy.
9958,REALLY cool game! I enjoyed the heck out of it! I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes good FPS games! I now its always on sale for usually a few bucks for the GOTY version there is really no reason not to have this one in your collection!
9959,Where it all Began .........
9960,"I originally played borderlands 1 & 2 on the PS3 and 360, but I decided to try this one out on my shiny new PC, as I have officially converted to the PC master race and what could be a better way to break it in than some good ol' Borderlands? I reallly enjoyed it and if you haven't played a borderlands game, you should try it out, its better than most other shooters out there, the cell-shaded graphics are nice, the RPG elements are enjoyable, you can collect a bazllion guns, and kill a bazillion enemies. Seriously, play this shit, its a classic."
9961,"First let me say if you play the story out right, you'll really just be running in circles doing quest.  I found it irratating having to constantly back track between NPCs. What is most fun is just making things blow up or shooting dumb enemies. The weapon system is interesting but badly explained.  Driving can either feel clumsy or fun depending on your prefereces. The setting and characters are fun but I feel it leaves something to be desired. If I took this game as an RPG it leaves a bad taste in my mouthas many RPGS are really just quest round ups with little to no zest. As an FPS it does ok and can be entertaining once you get past the odd weapon system. Overal I really didn't care for it."
9962,"One of my favorite first person loot-based RPG shooters. Lengthy adventure with fun characters, challenges and interesting lanscape to traverse. The DLC adds a lot more content and some fresh ideas and locations to the formula. Highly recommended."
9963,Nice game!!
9964,"This is 1 of the many master pieces out ther

9965,"Played it through, and I liked it alot. As for differences between this and the console versions, smoother gameplay, better graphics, absolutly no glitches."

9968,"Borderlands: The Good Kind of Stupid

I really like borderlands, which is probably obvious considering I have played close to 200 hours of it. Honestly, that number surprised me. But, I guess that’s to be expected when you play through a game (and its DLC) five times. 

Whether you like it or not, Borderlands has a style that is 100% its own. I happen to love it. 

Take the humor, for example, I’ve heard many people use Claptrap as a negative example of the game’s humor. And I completely understand their point of view… Claptrap is annoying: it’s a fact. however, in a strange way, that’s what makes him endearing. Claptrap has never bothered me, but I also never took him seriously. 

I found characters like Scooter, Tannis, and Mr. Shank to be far more enjoyable. Scooter for his deliverance-esque drawl, Tannis for her first person account of her time on Pandora, and Mr. Shank for... well, I think you’d have to be there. Suffice it to say, the humor in borderlands is not subtle, but it’s purposely not subtle. And it’s my opinion, that it required some skill to prevent this game from turning into nothing but complete stupidity. 

Don’t get me wrong, Borderlands is stupid. It’s just the good kind of stupid.

Aside from the ‘distinct stupid’ Borderlands rolls with, it also carries itself with a unique visual style.

Borderlands is cel shaded, like many of its counterparts, however this game distinguishes itself with its artstyle. The character models all have a nice -simple- silhouette to them, and the majority of their liveliness comes from detailed textures with strong black lines and a physically ‘drawn’ look that doesn’t feel like it’s trying too hard to look like a comic book or cartoon. Even five years after its release, the game’s graphics hold up, mostly due to the aforementioned art style. However, comparing the game to its successor, Borderlands 2, shows just how far the tech has come since Borderlands was released. 

Unfortunately, there are some negatives… the biggest gripes I have with Borderlands are actually a small aspect of the graphics, and in my opinion a pretty large design flaw. Concerning the graphics, my issue is with the ‘elemental effects’: they look very, very Unreal3. That’s probably because... the game runs on Unreal3, which isn’t bad, but the effects stand out to me as generic. Everything else has Borderland’s strong art direction and style wrapped around it. But when you proc the acid, fire, or lightning effects they just look like any other game using Unreal. It might seem minor, but it was enough that it pulled me out of the experience. 

My only other real complaint concerning the graphics would be that there are low-res textures here and there. Not a huge deal. Other than that, the majority of the environments look the same, but when the game takes place on a desert planet used as a massive junk yard, there isn’t going to be much biome diversity. To their credit, the game’s DLC take place in areas vastly different from the desert junk yards of the main story. Like an ancient ocean floor that a massive highway has been built over, cool stuff!

As for how the game actually plays, the shooting mechanics aren’t amazing, but they get the job done. Really, the main draw of the gameplay is the different classes and their respective abilities. And the oodles and boodles of guns. 

Each gun feels different in how it fires. Unfortunately they don’t pack a major punch, and they don’t feel very heavy, but that also comes from the ‘dice roll’ nature of the game. (Damage is dealt damage similarly to how it would be in an RPG.) For instance, I’ve run into a situation in which I was fighting a Badass (elite enemy) and loading him full of HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS of rounds of ammunition. 

This is actually my biggest complaint with the games mechanics: if you’re gear isn’t up to par, the game can become VERY difficult. Every time you die, the enemies in the area regenerate their health and you lose a percentage of your money. There were some cases in which I lost every cent I had because I died over and over again. Not the game’s best moments, but not enough to make me put it down

Overall though Borderlands is a wonderful game with a stupid sense of humor that just wants to make you happy. If you can look past some dumb jokes, some minor graphical missteps, potentially irritating Badasses, and a couple annoying characters there is a wonderful game underneath.

9969,"Borderlands is a game that was on my wishlist for a long time, and now, after my friend purchased it for me, I can say that is a game that I really recommend to all of you because:
- is cheaper than the rest from the category shooting and it worth the money totally
- is a method to banish boredom 
- is a good method to increase your performance at aim
- have a really nice graphic
- have co-op mode
- have missions
- and... why you don't try?

Enjoy!"
9970,"Awesome game, worth buying and spending your money. Recommended to buy."
9971,"This game is a lot of fun.  It is an entertainig first person shooter. I did not like having to go places for missions, though if this was ""real"" then you would have to talk to people to turn in and get new missions.  I also thought Clap-trap was supposed to be hilarious... maybe that isn't until the second one.  Oh well, I have been having a blast with the zombies...."
9972,Great game yes. But I played Borderlands 2 before I played the orignial because I found out about Borderlands 2 first. Not as good. But still amazin yes.  So far I have played all Borderlands and still have never got bored.
9973,I can not say this was a good game. Repetitive
9974,"Borderlands mixes the first person shooter genre with roleplaying games, set in the desert world of Pandora. You play as one of four classes of vault hunters seeking to uncover the legendary vault, led by an enigmatic voice guiding you forward.

The blend of the genres and gameplay consisting of shoot & loot is fun, although the story elements fall short of desireable. You get one ability to complement your arsenal and perks that influence your stats or ability, but there's little else of customization. Do not expect to see much variety in the environment either.

Although you can skip this game entirely and play Borderlands 2 (improves a lot) without missing out on much, it is still a fun game.

This review is based on the standard game, the DLC missions were not tried."
9975,"I'm only 25.7 hours in as of writing this. I've come back to this game after a lot of Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel co-op. Also, I started over and know nothing about the DLCs.

Borderlands 1 feels more fun to play alone. The multiplayer interface made so seemless in the sequels, has a few extra hurdles. The one that left a lastingly negative taste in my mouth, was having to get everyone through the same quest as they joined the party. I had to get the gate key from Sledge like 5 times in 2 days. Maybe I was doing it wrong. That was before.

I think I didn't really understand Bordelands the first time I played it. It was too silly to be immersive, the guns and the scenery all looked the same. It took BL2 make me realize that these games are not story-driven vehicles of immersion. They're to be played like a First-Person Diablo. BL2 shoved it in my face, crammed it down my throat. BL2 was obnoxious, but fun-as-hell with friends. There was so much dialogue you couldn't hear over shots-fired that the story just melted in the background with highly-varied scenery. BL2 was an ADD slot-machine spitting colors and bad jokes and prizes.

Coming back to Borderlands 1, I find it more mute, and atmospheric. And playing as Mordecai the Hunter really sells it because you have to setup a little ambush every time and keep an eye on sales for an up-to-the-moment awesome shield. When I first get into the game, I trudge around and check boxes for money/ammo, just letting the ambient sound and music sink-in. Then I think of that little joy I get from getting a critical on someone (another slot machine effect) and pick my way out into the wasteland.

Here's to killing Sledge one more time...."
9976,This game is ruddy awesome
9977,Best game ever and the sequel and prequell are awsome as well
9978,so much fun!!!
9979,"I just finished my first playthrough of Borderlands. First up, the gameplay is really fun; people have often made the 'Diablo with guns and FPS' comparison, which is reasonably accurate in terms of the pacing of the action. I played solo, but I can really see how it'd be a lot of fun with a buddy. 

Overall it was an enjoyable action FPS first and foremost, with RPG-lite elements. I'd recommend playing it to any fan of FPS games generally, but don't expect much depth here if you're a hardcore RPG fan. Personally I got a good 20 hours of entertainment from it, but I don't see myself replaying this game or farming it for items endlessly. Most of the 'named' guns that dropped throughout for me were worse than what I already had in greens and blues!

Without giving anything away, I'd like to add that the endling was a massive disappointment... I don't know what they were thinking. It's a sudden, jarring anticlimax that left me sitting in my chair feeling utterly puzzled."

"
9987,"Borderlands is one of my favorite franschice series of all time, but if i haft to choose which one is my all time favorite in all 3 of these games? Then it would be Borderlands 1.
Why, well here are my reason why i like Borderlands 1.

1: It has funny moments in differnt scene and in fighting.
2: Very good guns especialy om Assult Rifle, Rocket Launcher, Pistol and many more.
3: Great and good boss and other enemy, like some of these exemple:
Skags, Bandit, Alian, Spiderant, Scythid, Drifter and oother.
4:Clap-Trap that he is changing from acting all normal in games and later on he become differnt but in more funnier and somthing else.
5:Good Character to choose which one to pick from, but could have added to them to talk somthing more than just taking damage, level lup, ride in vehicle and other things.

And i hope other will are agreed with me!!"
9988,"If you like shooters and you like diablo, it doesnt matter, because this is different enough from those to be an original experience"
9989,"The game still holds up, even compared to it's modern sequels (pre-sequels?). Good graphics, fun gameplay, and just enough of a story to keep me entertained, this has been one of my go-to games for multiplayer mayhem since it first released.

RECOMMENDED?: Though Borderlands 2 is an overall better game, this one is still worth it, ESPECIALLY if you can find the GOTY edition on sale."
9990,"After owning Borderlands since either the year of or the year after release, I've finally taken the time to sit down and play it through. 

My first couple attempts I either lost interest, had to wipe my hard drive, started with friends but by the next day nobody else wanted to continue... Whatever else...
(I believe the furthest I ever actually got before was Krom's Canyon.)

I've gotta say, I had a lot of fun with it. 
Sadly, I only own and have played through the main game, 
I own none of the DLC and at this point highly doubt I'll be getting any of it.

I don't understand everybody's disappointment with the ending.

Anyway, time to start playing through Borderlands 2."

9998,"well me and my friend were riding a car in this game when suddenly a bandit vehicle came riding beside us, i was using the turret while he was driving this car.
out of nowhere my friend drove right up at a hill and did a barrel roll mid air right over the enemy vehicle and right in the middle of this barrel roll i used the rocket turret to shoot our enemy to a million pieces and we made a perfect landing.

9999,Its aiiiight
10000,A breath of fresh air in an oversaturated market. This is one of the few must own games of the last years.
10001,Excellent for multiplayer
10002,"This game is a diamond in the rough among shooters not only does it mix two completely different geners it manages to hook you into the game from the start. Borderlands has a large amount of replayability due to the amount of characters to try, multiplayer, and endless amounts of dlc. If you are a fan of action packed shoot 'em ups and comedy this is the game for you!"
10003,"I feel sick every time when I Played FPS Game But Borderlands make me a lot of fun. With Great Gameplay in FPS+ RPG , I strongly recommend U to buy it ! 10/10"
10004,While Borderlands 2 is arguably the strongest overall offering in the franchise the storyline of Borderlands is too much fun to be passed over.
10005,"Borderlands is a pretty unique FPS, with it's zillions of guns and very unique setting. Worth checking out if you want to try something different."
10006,how bout a good old game of borderlands
10007,This is the first game in the series that started me as an avid gamer. Before this I was a casual gamer until I realized the true depth a game could have. I have bought this game on two platforms. Highly recommend.
10008,"I played this game for a bazillion hours on the Xbox 360 all throughout high school, and you know what? This game is still amazingly fun to play. I own the three Borderlands games (Not that Telltale game one) and by far I prefer this one to the others. The others have more stuff and new content but also they are more oriented for multi-player. I find Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel very frustrating to solo. This game on the other hand is extremely fun, alone or with a team. This game has been out for around five-six years so I assume that most people know what it is about and it's gertneral idea so I won't go into that much. It has two playthroughs for each character and four characters to play, plus the four DLC. For total enjoyment of this game I would suggest the GOTY (Game of the Year) edition. This game has a special place in my heart and am happy to call it my favorite game of all time. 

(By the way, if you have played the other two, you know that BS about enemies running away when you need to get second wind? Yea in this game that doesn't exist)

13/10 would play a million times over (Which is what I'm working through now)"
10009,you can easly put this game near the limit of the games settings and  its a 1%laggy
10010,"I got this game and had about 3 days worth of playing, then it stopped working with a message that some file was missing. I have redownloaded once, and reinstalled 3 times now and can't get past the options screen, I have not been able to find any similar problems reported in the support section and no response from the makers. The error message is something about an assertion fail and file not found... Sick of trying, if anyone has a clue, please let me know."
10011,"If you are a fan of Borderlands 2, try this game, youll surely like it. If you havent played Borderlands 2, play this game beforehand. Youll be less confused. If you have played Borderlands: The Presequel and neither of the previously mentioned games, you have failed miserably and will not be forgiven. GREAT GAME THOUGH, TRY IT!"
10012,Fuck yes
10013,"Nice style, and great coop play."
10014,Outstanding Replayability!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10015,"Excellent game, definately worth picking up for anyone who is new the the series.  A lot of fun to play solo, even better to play with friends.  Graphics still look really good when cranked up to high."
10016,"Epic journey! Very good RPG with a good sense of humor. 
Too bad there's is almost no variety in the environments. 
Pick it up for a couple of bucks."
10017,"Truly the gem of the series. It's loot-system is far superior to borderlands 2's. The story is still pretty good if you read all the text boxes, untfortunately there isn't many actual spoken dialog."
10018,"For the 5 dollars I got this game on the steam sale i have enjoyed every bit of it.  This beginner to the entire trilogy is set in Pandora, a planet riddled with danger and bandits.  I am not even 5 hours even and I am already loving it.
10/10 worth buy"
10019,"I spent more than half an hour just volentarily watching claptrap dance like no one is watching.........oh the rest of the game? Oh right, I have no words to describe the immense fun I have whenever i play this game. Trust me, you wont regret buying it. Ever."
10020,Best game for fun RIP DAI!!
10021,"Incredibly boring with really rubbish weapon randomisation that they really boasted about before the game came out.

You have your basic archetypes, like shotguns, pistols, yada yada, but the only change you'll get is the elemental damage on them. No rocket-firing pistols or any other madness.

Forget playing this."
10022,"Last time I played much FPS was back in 2005 with TacOps mod for UT something. But this game about opening boxes and toilets and pressing 'E' alot seems kinda fun, for a bit. Except the toilets part.

It's got some severe mouse problems. I play on a 14"" Razer Blade and the camera is all over the place, even with dpi and sensitivity cranked all the way down. The save-game system also doesn't work properly if you don't get far enough into the game before you leave.

* Invisible wall syndrome
* Contrived map layouts forcing you to take the long way around.
* Pressing 'E' a lot.
* Instant failure states abound - don't try to jump down from this or that, or walk off the map, bam dead.
* Enjoy looking down a lot so you can loot stuff. And shoot small mobs like dogs and midgets. It's bloody annoying. And bloody.
* Some cool jumping secret hidden loot crates. Enjoy opening loot chests? You will enjoy this game.
* Hope you like explosions and tons of numbers flying everywhere on the screen with some class/weapons combos. It's to the point where you sometimes choose weapons based not on what's most damaging, but what you can actually see what you're shooting with.
* Melee isn't even remotely useful in this game, so bollocks to the Berserker, the rest of the classes are all playable and good at some stuff, but the Berserker's class skill is just silly. (I'm bad at FPS's, though. YMMV.)
* Enjoy backing up a lot later in the game. Shotgun + walking backward is just too effective to pass up in DLC1.
* Quite the often you're better off finding enemies to shoot at by just looking at the 'radar' thing at the bottom of the screen. Which is silly. Enemies' AI is also silly, most of the time. But it's a power fantasy for people who like to feel powerful in computer games, I suppose.
* UI is a mess, as usual. Plenty of times there's so much text and stuff all over that you can't see what you're pointing at. Esp. when doing ""pick up 50 crystals or whatever"" quests.
* If you enjoy toilet humour and opening toilets to see what's inside, then THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.
* I'm sincerely sorry if you're playing through the DLCs and didn't realize that the enemies in DLC3 don't scale for some reason until you complete one of the final quests, meaning all loot and enemies are trivial in that DLC unless you hit it at just the right level. Silly.

Still a good game. Loot and shoot."
10023,"Simpler, happier times..."
10024,"This game seperates your true friends from the greedy hoebags.

10/10 would buy again."
10025,Super game. For lovers of Series Borderlands definitely recommend it. With the STEAM and more can once again play with your friends and enjoy so much more about entertainment.
10026,"This game is a masterpiece. With a memorable characters, great humour, beautiful cel-shaded graphics and hours of content, you simple can't go wrong with this game. 

It's hard to put into words really. This game just has a lot of diverse gameplay with an innovative take on the FPS genre. This rethinking of the genre allows this game to be enjoyable for both casual and hardcore gamers. Its open-world setting allows for hours of exploring (both on foot and in a tank) side-questing, weapon-collecting and just screwing around. To top it off, it has 4-player story co-op (and it's done well). 

There are also 4 classes to choose from: Beserker, Siren, Hunter and Soldier - each with their own skills and abilities.

This game is definitely recommended for lovers of the Bioshock and Fallout series but is also a great place to start for people who are new to the genre."
10027,"I like the combination FPS-RPG, and is well implemented in this game . Lot of fun is offered, with some grinding missions, many types of guns with loot system. I really recommend this game!"
10028,"Love this game, Such a classic <3"
10029,"227 hours invested and I rarely played multiplayer, which in itself is a selling point.

This is a fantastic game but Borderlands 2 pretty much improved upon this in every way."
10030,"Borderlands is a comic book about guns and explosions and guns and overblown personalities and guns. But, like, a video game.

The decent storyline is stretched over a loot-driven festival of gibs, skill trees, bad aim, and questionable morality that's bound to make any FPS fan plenty happy.

The only disappointment is the ending boss, but the journey makes the whole thing worthwhile. Hilarious voice acting, tons of tongue-in-cheek jokes, enough mobs and enemies to shake all 17.75 million gun variations at, and some seriously sadistic entertainment make Borderlands a game I can heartily recommend. Grab 3 friends and co-op the whole thing!

Unless you don't like FPS games you panzy."
10031,Better than the 2nd. in some ways.
10032,"Save a lawless planet from itself and a monster!

Graphics:
While I am not usually a fan of cell shading, it makes all the graphics pop out and look really good and there is some VERY good detail on all the character models and set pieces.  Someone worked MORE than just very hard on these things!  My only issue is that sometimes when arriving into a new area, the graphics are blurry for a few seconds.  Annoying, but only slightly.

Sound:
The sound is very good, if a bit bland in certain areas.  But I will admit that I have just stayed in certain areas longer than usual just because of the music.  The voice acting is hilarious and well done (even IF Clatrap is almost more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks).  The guns sounds are also well varied and nice.  No issues here.

Controls:
I played with both controller and keyboard/mouse and they were both comptant with little issue (I did rebind come keys for comfort).  Again, no complaints here.

Gameplay:
Take a standard loot fest game and make it an FPS.  And this formula works so dang well for this.  I have never been so excited to see what new gun I would get or what silly name would come next.  And the skill trees give you much room for customizability to make your character truly your own; and the special ability at the end of each tree made it worth maxing the tree out!  The story about looking for a Vault full of treasure may sound typical, but the story getting there has many hilarious twists and turns and side paths that will make you want to go through the game again!  Multiplay online is also handled well, with monsters being scaled to the number of players, though not from levels, from what I have seen.  My only issues are that you have to have a Gamespy account to play online, online stabilty is soly based on the host's internet, making for some lagfests, and there is an issue with some players not being able to complete the General Knoxx DLC because it makes the game crash.

This game took the standard medieval fantasy setting for loot fest-type games and spun it on it's head!  I reccomend this game to anyone looking into getting into the story of the Borderlands!"
10033,Time to die!
10034,Best CooP for me.
10035,"Unlike Borderlands 2, it is possible to beat this one solo.  Too bad no one plays online on this game anymore..."
10036,Mordecai or GTFO.
10037,"Played back in the day, couldnt buy dlcs. Copped for 7.29 with all dlcs. If you like BL Classic then take your time and buy this game on sale. 10/10"
10038,"Definitely a game worth buying, especially during a sale with all the DLC. Borderlands is an open world RPG that's loot focused like Diablo styled ARPGs and it has questing similiar to WOW. On top of that the characters and very comedic and funny and the world - thought on the surface very bland looking - is actually cool to see and explore. 

The DLC are worth it if you get them during a sale. General Knoxx extends the max level as well as having a great story line, the clap trap revolution continues where the story left off (and includes some good Bioshock references) and the Jakkabs Cove (might be wrong name) is a zombie themed expansion and is very easy, but was enjoyed as a casual area to do quests. 

My only complain with the game is the frame rate, I've known it to be bad to other people who have better computers than my dinosaur, but I managed to live through it and enjoy the gameplay."
10039,I probably have over 3k hours on the console(Yes I know console sucks) but its such a great game! You can replay through it countless times.
10040,Nice game ;)
10041,"Just started playing this game, it's definitely one of the best games I have ever played."
10042,I'm having a blast with this game. Tried the console version of this game when it first came out. I'm loving the PC version so much better. it's a must play on PC. GG
10043,Apparently I own this game
10044,I put over 2000 hrs on solo & mutiplayer before gamespy shut down.
10045,"A great game, filled with action, adventure, clever and witty writing/dialogue, and most importantly, tons and tons of epic lewts!"
10046,"This game is a lootfest, much like diablo 2, except played in the ever popular first person view. I love the art style, and the game play itself is very good. It has some RPG elements thrown in along with the loot finding. Where this game really shines is the Co-op play. Teams of 4 scour Pandora killing enemies, completing quests, and finding loot.  The only thing it really needs is more characters to choose from. 

I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys FPS games, anyone that plays RPG games, and anyone who enjoys a good loot fest."
10047,"if you want a baddas, you get it"
10048,"Well, for his time, this game was absolutly awesome...
Boring if you play it singleplayer... but cooperative? is a fucking blast!

So, bring some friends and play the campaing with all the dlc!"
10049,"I played this game half way through almost 2 years ago but then stopped playing due to how frustrating it is. I tried playing it again today from where I left off and I still hate the game just as much.

Probably the most frustrating thing about this game is how under powered the weapons are.  It literally take 3 point blank shotgun blasts to take down the little Borderlands midget which is ridiculous. Say your fighting another enemy such as a Bruiser, this game make me waste majority of my ammo just to kill it. If you shoot the bruiser in the head with a level 20 or so sniper rifle, their health bar barely even budges. Even a rocket launcher which shoots 3 missiles at a time won't bring the Bruisers health below half, let alone kill it. What a waste of time...

Another problem with the weapons, is how may gun options/levels there are. Whats the point of this? This game make me waste so much time comparing the crappy weapons that I already have in my inventory to the even crappier weapons that were dropped by an enemy that I just killed. Not to mention majority of the guns that are dropped are extremely low level weapons which makes them completely useless.  Then lets say you want to want to pick up all these crappy weapons and sell them at the vending machines, you can't because your backpack's capacity is so extremely limited even with the backpack upgrades.

A third problem with this game is how the vending machines for Ammo (and Health) are only at the starting of each level. This normally wouldn't be a problem but lets say you play the level through and get to the first check point (save point) but die shortly after because of low ammo. When you respawn you may want to return to the vending machines to max out your ammo and health but you can't because all the enemies you just killed will respawn with you. This is just absolutely stupid since the game saved, those enemies are already dead. Again, this wouldn't be a problem if they put the vending machines at every check point but they don't. 

Due to the lack of vending machines, this game in certain ways, forces you to ration ammo since there is not enough ammo (or health) pick ups in each level which is also extremely frustrating. This just decreases the enjoyment of the game when you constantly have to conserve your ammo which is impossible since it takes so much ammo to kill each enemy.

Overall this game is just horrible. There are many other things I could pick out on why I don't like this game but the above are some of the main reasons. I have no idea what all the hype is about the borderlands series but its definitely not for me since I am not able to find any enjoyment in it.

0/10 
"
10050,"Soooo muuuuch fuuuun! I normally hate cel-shading but it was done so well in this game that it doesn't come off annoying or cheesy. It gives the game a very stylistic set of visuals that give the game far more character. Characters are interesting, albeit your main characters are pretty quiet. More dialogue and commentary would have been neat, cutscenes as well. Hard to nitpick on this game, also a difficulty setting would be nice. 

""Catch a riiiiiiide!"""
10051,"After playing borderlands 2 and the pre sequel, this game the original still remains fun and addicting. 
It is actually much more challenging that borderlands 2."
10052,"Still as good as ever, even if its been overshadowed (somewhat) by the second entry.

To put it simply, Borderlands is a bit nuts. Even with the flaws, I'd still recommend it, although you may not find it as fun as the second game if you started playing that first. At least there isn't the ridiculous plethora of mostly-meaningless DLC to wade through.

The Good: 
++ Essentially Diablo the FPS (in all the best ways)
++ Fast & fun gameplay that doesn't rely on hiding like a b!^@# behind cover every time you start taking hits
++ Huge world to explore, with tons to do
++ Great (and simple) DLC that doesn't feel like its invading your wallet
++ Crazy guns that do crazy things
++ Crazy people... not doing much, to be honest
++ Easy to tell if enemies are too strong for you or not

The Bad:
-- Essentially Diablo the FPS (In all the worst ways)
-- Limited enemy types (bunch of guys in hockey masks, and some reoccurring wildlife)
-- Health pickups are imbalanced - either they're too common when you really don't need them or too rare when you really do. Always bring spare kits.
-- Gun selection is surprisingly limited; even if there's a ton of them, most are copies of previous versions, and with so many drops it can be a hassle to filter through them to find the ones worth keeping - even just to sell them.
-- Additionally, finding a GOOD weapons that ffits the player can be a hassle, as the game throws so many guns at the player that it becomes a chore just to figure out whether the gun they currently have is worse than the one they just picked up, and vice versa.
-- First DLC (The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned) is crap, even if a funny call-back to old sci-fi movies in general.
-- This series REALLY needs a pet of some kind - similar to Torchlight where you can dump stuff onto them and continue adventuring while they zip off back to sell your stuff. Or better yet, a portable weapons/equipment dump.
-- No good way to sort items :<
-- Impossible to fight enemies that are more than 2~3 levels above the player, even with some strategizing and crafty playing

The Ugly:
__ Can glitch sometimes
__ Some weapons are TOO gimmicky; their gimmicks make them impossible to use at all because of the bullet patterns, despite being powerful weapons in their own right (looking at you TK's Wave and Madjack). Even worse when they're useless
__ Graphics aren't all that great even for the time. BL2 vastly improves upon them.
__ Not much in the way of NPC nor personal character development; they're essentially there to hand out quests & rewards, and that's about it...
__ Outside of DLC, there's maybe... 3 actual bosses in the game? Total? Not even many unique enemies to be honest
__ ""Badass"" enemies can be a bit too harsh at times, especially when they pop up around the player's level.
__ The ""classes"" feel a bit limited, and don't come close to the customizability of the BL2 classes."
10053,"Probably one of the greatest games i've ever played.

10 out of 10 would definetly catch a ride again."
10054,"This is a wonderful game. Though if you were to get a copy of it, get the GOTY version. The DLC's are great, they include Crawmerax,(Raid Boss) and much more content. This is a great game series to get into, just dont get the Pre-Sequel. That one is trash."
10055,Pretty much everyone knows Borderlands by now but to anyone who is doesn't know this game is great and i highly recommend it to any RPG/FPS fan!
10056,This is the game that single-handedly got me into PC gaming. There's nothing not to like!
10057,"My first trip to Pandora was July, 2011. This is my second trip back. Whataride! 

As you can guess from the release of the sequel and the pre-sequel, Borderlands is a good, fun game as it combines role-playing with a first person shooter. It does start out a little bit slowly, but when you finally get your first weapon with elemental effects (a gun that sets the enemy on fire), then it starts getting good. Then, of course, when you get to use your special ability, then it starts getting really good. The story is fun and filled with tongue-in-cheek humor and in-jokes. The weapons gets a bit confusing, and you will end up selling what you collect because some of what you find has a nice, bigger ""boom"". And, yes, I get a kick out of hearing Scooter and the somewhat-annoying claptrap. 

The story is a bit weak, and there are some weaknesses in this game, but that's all fixed in Borderlands 2 which also goes on sale frequently as well. The order that you should play the games is Borderlands, Borderlands 2, and The Pre-Sequel. 

If you are interested in getting this game, keep your eye out for a sale on the Borderlands ""Game Of The Year"" edition which includes all of the DLC content. Also, a recent update removed all of the GameSpy integration and replaced it with the Steam integration for multiplayer (thank you Gearbox). 

Since this is a five year old game, you will need to [url=http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Borderlands_PC_Tweaks]go into the WillowEngine.ini and change UseVsync from False to True[/url]. Otherwise, you are going to see some horrible screen tearing during gameplay. While you are at it, you can disable the intro movies as well. 

"
10058,"Few games really are compelling enough for someone like me to not only finish once, but consider finishing for every character (and at least take one through the second full playthrough).  There is so much in this game to do, whether you enjoy collecting the loot, messing around, or dueling in MP.  With the variety of weapons and compelling skill choices, it's nearly impossible to get an identical run like the one you just did."
10059,"Love the game, even though i got it after Borderlands 2, i love the series, cant wait to be able to aford the other games, i think this series is the most epic, its the first series that has kept me hooked, i'd recommend it to anyone"
10060,vader was the the chosen one
10061,"Normal Game w/ DLC: 9/10
Game & DLC With Rice: 11/10"
10062,Literal garbage.
10063,Best game ever!!
10064,"I honestly don't get why people love this game. I find it to be just a very bland fps-rpg. Very boring gameplay and story. Level progression is to slow as the enemy level increases faster than yours leaving you dying over and over again until you take out a room of thugs. The map is just bleck wasteland with not much in it except some plants. I just can't mentally understand why people like this game so much as I found myself bored within a hour of playing. 

6/10"
10065,"This game is simply a must buy, best co op game ive played!"
10066,"[h1]+[/h1]
Art style and environment design compliment each other well
Characters are memorable and story is well-written
Loot generation system is executed very well
DLCs 1 & 3 are incredible additions to the game
Multiplayer to singleplayer and back is effortless
[h1]-[/h1]
Power level is naturally pretty high towards the end of the game, especially if you've sidequested at all, leading to a very underwhelming final boss fight
DLC 3 is essentially all end-game content (not a problem anymore as most of you will pick up the GOTY edition)

Borderlands is a masterpiece cross-over and an undeniable 'must play'. The charm of the characters you play as and interact with is truly unique and will grow your attachment to the world and story just as much as the art will. Enemies, with the exception of human enemies, are all interesting while they engage you with the bandits and soldiers through scripted encounters or more complex geography. Gearbox concieved an evolved random loot generation system based on inter-compatible gun modules that was executed well for both regular and modded play, a feat few systems achieve. Overall BL1 has a lot of things to love about it and really opened the door for more ambitious shooter crossovers across the board."
10067,"I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of this game for XBox from my buddy for helping him move. I probalby would not have played it if not for that.

I then determined the game was so good that it was worth buying for Steam when I waved bye bye to consoles for good! Do not let my meager 8.9 hours played on Steam discredit my review overall. I have far more hours than that logged. I'm also going to give this game another go when a buddy of mine picks up a copy. 

This game has tremendous replay value and some epic DLC's to boot. The only DLC I didn't care much for was Mad Moxxies Underdome. That to me was not challenging, lacked story, and too reptitive.

Bottom Line: Buy this game!"
10068,"Overall, Borderlands is an ok game. However, once you get past the cell-shading you realize that it has a ton of flaws. There is a lot of content, sure, but most of it is all very similar. There was around three missions where you collect journal entries, and a ton of missions where you scavage for gun parts. The story is weird, and in most cases non-exhistant. These missions were especially hard because the objective marker would pretty much lie to you about the locations of the parts or entries. It did thi for other missions to. The same enemies will always respawn, so you will be killing the same group of enemies many times, and that gets really tedious after a while to the point where you will just run away because it is more efficient than combat. This really devalued exploration because if you left an area the enemies would respawn, and any time and effort you put in to killing them was now lost. Some people have a problem with the car, but I thought that it was ok, but I mainly used it to run people over, because it is usually a one hit kill, and it was faster then bothering to kill people. It was nearly impossible to distinguish what missions were story, and which was just a side mission. The game was fun for a little while, but it kept dragging on and on, and got really boring after a while. The game essentially devolved itself, and what I mean by that is, instead of charging into battle, and shooting everyone, I either ran past them, or went behind cover, and shot them until the room or base was cleared, rince and repeat. I also did this for boss fights. (even the final boss) The guns were cool, however, I used around 16 throughout the game, and I rarely switched grenade mods, shields, or class mods. There was a good amount of variety, but that is really all I can say about that. As for the second wind mechanic, it was a cool concept, but you cant move so if all the enemies are either taking cover or out of range (which is common) you are just out of luck. Probably my biggest problem is that the final boss sucks. Throughout the game you are told that if you open the vault you will get fame and fortune (that is pretty much the whole story), but what happens at the end... its a giant monster that kills people and doesn't move. To beat it I just went behind cover, and when it wasn't attacking, I shot it. This took a bit, but it never even damaged me because it can't move. There are a lot of cop out boss fights I'm afraid. One of the later bosses is just a bunch of generic enemies followed by a slightly tougher generic enemy. The only reason I haveany hours on this game is because I became comitted to beating it so that if I look back at my steam games I will remember that I don't need to play this because it sucked and I beat it."
10069,nice!
10070,"this game is guccier than Kayden even knows, he doesn't know though because he does not want to spend 5$ on a game that is awesome, amazing, and even amazinger than er thing else. Buy it now ;)"
10071,badass game
10072,Awesome game! I recommend it!
10073,A wonderful Co-Op game. It doesn't get much better then this for FPS fun!
10074,"i present day CLASSIC FPS game, buy it if you love to shoot things  with LOTS of different guns :D"
10075,"Tons of (random) gun combinations, neat class system, great desert steampunk feel and LOADS of wry, off-the-wall humour.  This series is a good ways in by now, but if you have yet to get into Borderlands, this is a great start!"
10076,Great Game!
10077,this game is the shit
10078,you know what would make fast paced action shooters more fun? spreadsheets! I enjoyed this game very much because I unfortunately have a medical condition which causes me to become sexual aroused by day planners
10079,"Dungeon Hunting, chest looting, and a stellar voice acting cast make this game one of the most fun I've ever played. It gets sorta tedious every now and then having to open chests and I wish there was a simpler way to sort through whether the gun you're about to pick up is better than the one equipped. Having to look at the arrows and read the numbers kinda takes away from the experience for me.

All-In-all, this is a great game with an okay story but amazing voice acting and really funny parts."
10080,"""Who needs a real doctor when you have my machines and their scary needles"""
10081,crap very glitchy
10082,Really the first rpg fps that would blow your mind with all the action numb and the loot you can dream of the game has millions of fans who just love the game to the core becasue of the blurring of serous character with so much humor it will keep you game for a while i tell this you will enjoy every moment in this game because of how it keeps you comn to play more with your friends!!!!!
10083,"This is a very fun game, and it is totally worth the buy. If you love the other two or just want to play the original, I highly recommend you pick it up."
10084,fun
10085,click on ppl with things to shoot out stuff
10086,Just as good as the 2nd one. 10/10
10087,"very good, tons of stuff to do, great visual style, 10 out of 10"
10088,"If you play it alone it can get a little boring ,but in my opinion the game is 100% worth buying just for the co-op."
10089,Waste of time.
10090,Killed a maniac with three balls 10/10
10091,
10092,"Got 60 hrs out of this game, all pretty good ones too! Lots of action. The graphics and sound are pretty good too. I enjoyed the game and look forward to playing part II and the newest one eventually."
10093,"Borderlands is the first in a groundbreaking series of games that changed the face of shoot n loots forever. Borderlands 1 by itself is a great game, but with community mods, multiplayer, and dlcs, the game turns into something amazing. I played it on my ps3 for a little bit when it first came out, but it got boring on console due to the lack of friends that would want to play Borderlands, but now, its amazing. If you are looking for a shoot n loot/rpg game that is easy to run on your pc, this is it. If you can't run it right away try right clicking in in your steam library and going to startup options ad putting in ""-dx9"" without the """"s. I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good game to play with friends"
10094,It's amazing! Had to re-adjust my thinking & tactics from FPS and from there on it was a fantastic experience!
10095,"Graphics, gameplay, story are all great. Skill trees seem rather weird (ex. the sniper class has 4 perks that affect sniper rifles), BL2 is better in essentially every way though. Would recommend playing this before BL2.
Ned's zombie island DLC has the biggest plot twist in gaming history too"
10096,Loved this game. Action packed with thrills and BANG BANG CHILLS!
10097,anyone want to play with me?? love the game but i feel like playing with someone
10098,"Amazing in single player, and even better in multiplayer"
10099,best game  9/10
10100,"Randy Pitchford and the folks at Gearbox really created a true masterpiece when they made Borderlands.  There are so many aspects of this game that make it an instant classic.  First, the size and scope of the open world Pandora is tremendous.  The areas offer a ton of diversity both in the environment and with the creatures that inhabit them.  The FPS/RPG style of Borderlands is spot on offering a great skill tree and upgrade system.  You will find a decent variety of quests that keep the game flowing nicely.  And finally, the GUNS……they are offered in a standard RPG (WoW) color based hierarchy (green to legendary orange) that number in the millions of combinations of damage types, accuracy, and many other categories.  Overall Borderlands is just an addicting and awesome game that needs to be experienced by anyone who considers themselves a gamer. 9.0

The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned is a great Halloween themed DLC that continues the Borderlands experience. Quests are entertaining and well written. The characters are solid and very humorous. Overall, a fun add-on for fans of the original game that is worth checking out. 8.0

The Secret Armory of General Knoxx is by far the best of the four DLCs for Borderlands. In Secret Armory you are pitted against the elite of the Crimson Lance including General Knoxx himself. This add-on offers up some of the best locations in the game so far. Outstanding missions, fights and even a raid boss make General Knoxx the true definition of a great DLC. 9.0"
10101,"I normally don't play fps games, but I lowered my standards for my boyfriend’s sake and thought to give it a try. We wanted to LAN and found this game. I really enjoyed playing Borderlands GOTY with my boyfriend. We purchased Borderland 2 GOTY as well. I liked The Walking Dead's graphics and Borderlands has a similar style. The gameplay was enjoyable and I love the fact that it is controller enabled. The little robot is quite a character and the game is funny."
10102,Cranderlands is perfect.
10103,"Opened a gate only to find a sign that said ""PIS OFF"" 

10/10 would PIS OFF again"
10104,not worth your time since there was no story at all really instead of side missions everywhere and the controls were a bit weird on pc. i played through the second one first and i definitely recommend that.
10105,"Great game !

Highly recommend."
10106,You get to shoot midgets.
10107,"Guns, Guns, and more Guns. Add in a nice rp element and you have an excellent fps scifi epic. OCDers beware, you cannot collect them all."
10108,Yes.
10109,"Gun stats comparison simulator 2014! 11,025/10,758"
10110,jesus christ you need to play this game so hard.
10111,I still go back and play this game from occasionally.  I reallly enjoy it and have gotten my moneys worth out of it.
10112,"Skip this one and just play BL2, waste of my money."
10113,"I regularly die, friend doesn't get mad.  We point out loot to each other.  This game is dude-time.  Dude-time is for the bros.  Or sistahs.  Or Pats of the world, whatever, dude-time is unisex; shoot stuff up with compadres or however that's spelled."
10114,"Good game but made a bunch of fucking losers start listening and quoting Cage the Elephant which makes trying to discuss the band the most painful thing. 

Shame on you all."
10115,10/10
10116,You want a game where you don't have to give a s*** and still have the most fun ever? This game is perfect. My personal favorite game.
10117,"Ending was pure, unadulturated garbage 0/10 would not play again"
10118,"This is an amazing free roam game, dont let the games old age stop you from buying this!  Also, the dlc is a must have if your getting this game!"
10119,"Enjoyed this game quite a lot, big sandbox, lots of new things to do, lots of new guns to find. The only problem I had was that if playing solo it became a bit of a grind, other than that I had an absolute blast. Great sense of humour, bizarre and fun story and with a  beautiful engine. 9/10"
10120,"To be honest, I hate this game to begin with. But then it struck me how AMAZING this title is.....Border-fucking-lands people! 

get it."
10121,"Love this game, maxed out 4 characters on 360. and ps3.... now for steam!!!! and steam still has multiplayer!!!! yay!!!!

10/10!!!!!!!!!!!! addicting gameplay, though sometimes annoying. Mulitiplayer on steam more then solves the problem."
10122,"Although an older game, Borderlands has lost nothing of it's appeal and will keep on entertaining you with awesome graphics, intense gameplay and lots and lots of looting..."
10123,Finished in one sitting 6/5 would buy again for 7.50€
10124,"Great game, but if anything get the GOTY edition + BL2 combo.

Much better loot system than the other games but cannot farm bosses.

Im too bored to write a full review so I will finish it off with a 10/10"
10125,"Fun,Funny,great story!!!!"
10126,Have easily bought this game well over 10 times for friends. Just do it.
10127,"I love this game, one of the best playing experiences I've had in the last few years.

http://geekyblithering.blogspot.com/2014/12/borderlands.html"
10128,Awesome!
10129,Look at the amount of hours I've spent on this game. It's just so addictive and fun! <3
10130,Interesting FPS in postapocalyptic setting. Great itemhunt but repetitive quests. SP gets boring after some time
10131,"love this game, its annoying that the ammo drops arent picked up automatically like b2 but i can live with picking it all up manually
"
10132,Best game ever i love it
10133,"I have bought this game 7 times
 - Once when it first came out
 - Three times GOTY (Pre-Steam and twice on two separate steam accounts)
 - Once on PS3 and Twice on Xbox 360 (one digital and one physical)

Also ""received it for free"" once.
 - I was desperate...

I have completed it about 8 times.

10/10 would buy again.

2019 Updated Review: Still awesome, I am in love with this series even more now as it seems like Gearbox knows where their audience is, so I hope they keep the community just as alive as it has been for 10 years now.

Excited for 3 and I will never not love this franchise."
10134,Sometime I wish the DLCs had more fast travel.
10135,"If you don't know about Borderlands by now, you should correct this shortcoming INSTANTLY! This game is definitely one of the most recommendable ones out there, technically incredibly well made, straight-out iconically looking and simply a ton of fun.

Gameplay-wise it's Diablo meeting Serious Sam on top of one of the most hilarious narratives I ever encountered in a game. Choose one of four classes, grab a gun, shoot Bandits, Psychos, Midgets, and the mutated wildlife of a backwater desert planet, then collect more guns, and shoot more things. The RPG aspects are relatively dumbed down, in most of the cases an accurate trigger finger pays off more, but they still add nicely to the game overall.

Also big ups to the DLC - Borderlands is one of the few games whose DLC is actually well worth its price, apart from Moxxi's Underdome the DLCs add so much story that they basically double the play time of the whole game. And quality-wise they're just as awesome as, if not even a tiny bit more awesome than the base game."
10136,"Gud gasyme
"
10137,I know I'm playing this a little late compared to everyone else. For some reason I thought it was just going to be another fps. But after a friend asked me to play co-op I'm now hooked. The rpg elements are fantastic and I haven't been this grabby with loot since Diablo II. I've just bought the sequel in the Holiday Sale but I'm going to save it until I've completely milked this one.
10138,"Seriously, this game needs to be played by everyone"
10139,this game is so much fun
10140,funny game :D
10141,Great game
10142,"Highly Recommended! This is one Badass-Maniac of a game, with an ironic twinkle in the eye. Everything cool about shooters, Fantasy and RPG, brought to the edge and then given a kick. I quickly lost tack counting all the puns, references and inside-jokes.  Besides fast-packed action, development tree, insanely huge arsenal (about every gun you ancounter has different properties) and a twisted storyline with characters tending to cling to the verge of insanity (mostly from the wrong side), this game also includes a complete Nerd-o-Game cultural reference chart.
"" You scared?? - You should be!!"""
10143,"Pandora, a land of death, decay, bloodthirsty monsters, and deadly cannibalistic bandits...
CATCH A RIIDE!!!"
10144,A fun and goofy shooter with a nice verity to the guns you can pickup. I highly recommend anyone that's a fan of shooters try this game out.
10145,LOVE this game!
10146,yes
10147,"If you haven't played Borderlands yet, you should... NOW.
My favourite game series of all time, I love all of the games."
10148,"I really like this game.  I'm not usually a super big fan of FPS but Borderlands was highly recommended by my friends so I figured I'd give it a shot and I was not disapointed.  It has the perfect balance of storyline mixed with free range if you just want to go shoot stuff one day.

I was disapointed in the ending but it doesn't detract from the rest of the gameplay."
10149,המשחק הכי כיף של השנה!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10150,I got to shoot a midget in the head 10/10
10151,borderland isa good game it give me a challenge be my friend and we can play together
10152,Amazing game. Just buy it!
10153,This seemed like a good old shooter.  However alone this just wasn't fun.
10154,"A decent enough time-killer. I got it on sale with all the DLC campaigns, and managed to get to level 46 or so before I ran out of stuff to do.

Not as big a favorite as its sequel, but still a good purchase nonetheless."
10155,เป็นเกมที่อลังการงานปืนงานระเบิดมอนซะเต้อมาก 555555555 สนุกมากๆ ถ้าเล่นกับเพื่อนฝูง ออกแนว rpg หาของเพลินได้โล่ห์ สุดยอดครับผม
10156,"biggest guns, mode co-op with friends, loot of fun and too much blood, its awesome"
10157,Awesome Game!
10158,nice.
10159,A classic....... enough said!
10160,"This game was awesome like Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel. But, the HUD just differents with the Borderlands 2 and Pre Sequel. Good job for the future. I like the fastest graphics. So, maybe on the future Borderlands have to make fastest graphics for all users. Thanks."
10161,"I bought this game for xbox years ago, played hundreds of hours on it, then bought it here. Again. This should tell you enough about my opinion of this game.

10/10 would buy for both platforms again."
10162,"Fun game that mixes genres well. Can be a little tiring to trek back and forth to turn in missions, but on the whole a ton of fun."
10163,Excellent RPG+FPS. Try it!  9/10
10164,"If you like Co-Op games, get this.
Tons of weapons, tons of bad ass bosses (literally) and tons of fun."
10165,love this game
10166,So good
10167,"Awesome game.

First time I've played a 1st person shooter, and then I went and bought BL2 to play more.
Side quests are fun, but I have yet to give BL1 another playthrough to properly complete them all."
10168,awesome game still u need to play
10169,"Dark humor, a large variety of weapons, excellent balance, distinctive art direction, and expansive environments...

What more is there to say - and what's not to like?"
10170,"Cool story, cool graphics, shitload of stuff to do. Bit repetitive but very playable."
10171,"Absolutely love it! I think its a great game that all games should play. But, I recommend having alot of time since the game does have alot of missions and things you can do, which can take up alot of time."
10172,"I finished that game.

Liked :
- so many weapons and good feeling
- original background and story
- humour
- hack&slash touch
- graphisms
- playing with friends

Disliked :
- vehicle part
- some quests boring
- gameplay a bit repetitive
- playing without friends"
10173,"Great fun - had to get it for PC when I first discovered it was on Steam, after playing a lot of it on the Xbox 360. I've also got it on PS3. That means that this game is TOTALLY worth your time."
10174,"You shoot, you loot.
Set in the chillest of all the desert junkyards. Borderlands mellow and frantic lootfest kept me wanting to try the next gun over and over.
This kind of over the top, no subtlety, wackiness, with bosses named stuff like King Wee Wee, is what Gearbox should be doing. The elemental effects are especially hilarious, with electricity being my favorite.
The graphics and the music are nothing special, they do their job well enough. Although they should win some kind of Oscar for the opening cinematic.
The story is in there, it gives you a reason to go from a to b. But the NPCs monologues make it shine.
Make sure you are at the right character level for your current area, so the game does not get boring or frustrating."
10175,"This game is awesome, really good fun, fun just to pick up for a few hours here and there, gets more and more surreal as it goes on and the storyline is funny as hell."
10176,"""You should've seen that look on your face"""
10177,"Borderlands is like an RPG-FPS, you play the game like a shooter but at the same time you can loot stuffs, customize your inventory and gain experience from killing enemies. Usually, when you have an RPG with guns like Fallout, the shooting feels underwhelming mainly because it’s more of an RPG instead of a shooter. Not in this case though, Borderlands is not your typical RPG. It’s more like an action RPG where looting and killing lots of enemies are what makes the game so having a good shooting mechanic is a must. Thankfully, the shooting mechanic is good. Shooting guns don’t feel like shooting some toys, there is actually some weight behind every guns and shooting them actually feels deadly. It may not be as good as the shooting mechanic in Max Payne 3 or F.E.A.R. but it’s good enough that will keep you playing. 

There are also tons of different guns in the game and I’m not kidding about that part, there are literally about a million guns that can be found while playing in the game. Many of them are not just reskins either, you can find a shotgun that shoots rockets or a revolver that shoots shotgun pellets which are unique and fun to use. Seriously, there are so many weapons that eventhough you think you have the best gun you can find in the game, you will still want to loot for more guns.
 
The quests you are given in the game don’t have much variety. At the end of the day, it’s still basically go to this area and kill some enemies and maybe find some quest-related items. Despite that, the game paces itself nicely, I was rarely bored doing these quests as they don’t throw enemies at you repeatedly. Not to mention that the visual artstyle for this game really helps me enjoy the graphics of the landscapes. Especially at night, the graphics just blend with together creating a very atmospheric experience.
 
Overall, a good game to play with your friends.
 
7.5/10
"
10178,Hard time starting up.. Overall good game but it is a b1tch when it comes to starting up...
10179,WHY CAN'T I HOLD ALL THESE GUNS?
10180,"This is the amazing game ever, i´ve never played. First time, I´ve played (i don t know) one hour with my friends. We killed the first enemy, boss, find new guns, missions,first meeting with claptrap, and my reaction? ! SELL ! Just kidding. THIS IS AMAZING and AWESONE GAME!

Good graphisc, great multiplayer, story, Pandora, guns + with elements, characters, enemys, stupid kamikaze psycho, boss, cars, levels, SELLs guns, skills, my favorite SOLDIER, friends, sexy Siren and Moxxi, Claptraps, great DLC, arena , RoboRevolution, Vault is real ... Sometimes problems with bugs, lags ... Developer thx u very much for this game!"
10181,"Like Skyrim but with more annoying robots 
10/10-IGN

10182,Yet another mindless shooter but with a twist: enemies respawn. Nevertheless worth playing. Get the whole pack with dlcs.
10183,A lot of fun. Especially with your friends
10184,Great game +
10185,"this game made me cry like a bitch

10188,Works on my i3 netbook. 10/10
10189,Love it <3
10190,"As great as always! I have the retail version (which uses GameSpy for MP). GS unfortunately was shut down, so I thank whoever converted this to Steam and allowed retail users to get it on Steam for free."

10201,"Entertaining shooter / RPG; however I quite enjoyed the humour => ""Meet 9 toes; also he has 3 balls""."
10202,"This game is amazing, only bad thing is a paper-thin story. But who cares, you can walk around blowing a skag's face off. Don't know what a skag is? Buy the game."
10203,It's a very unique game and very enjoyable.
10204,"Fun fps with an interesting story. Graphics are corny, but on purpose and it works.
Snag this when its on sale, you wont be disappointed."
10205,"THIS IS THE GAME.A lot of fun nice co-op modality,all the gun in the game are so good nice story and nice character(mad moxxi <3) this game is cool and funny it's more funny to play whit friends"
10206,Good story line and play content. Though still on a Mature end of things. Helps to get Game of the Year on this game and any other DLC missing. You really do get the most gameplay with all the content there.
10207,"This game has a huge following but just wasent for me I think. Boring quests, hardly any voice over work for the quest givers. Found it quite repetitive to be honest almost like an MMO with MO part."
10208,Coolest Game I ever played! Wish I started earlier.
10209,"Diablo 2 with guns and it works out perfectly, fucking amazing. A fluke, but amazing."
10210,"My Borderlands 1 Review

SUMMARY

Borderlands 1 is an awesome mix of FPS and RPG; Taking a procedural weapon system like Diablo then adding in a tactical FPS system like Stalker. After having played Borderlands 2 then going back to Borderlands 1 out of nostalgia, I can say this game feels much less polished. While still a pinnacle gem of its time, Borderlands 1 now feels more like a beta engine containing the prologue to Borderlands 2. This prologue still has much to offer, but read on for details on my opinions of some of the game's features.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES

First issue I had coming back to Borderlands 1 is the FOV [Field of View] on my 1080p monitor. The FOV defaults to 70, which long ago I didn't notice was so bad on my 1440x900 16:10 monitor I used way back when. On my new HD 16:9 1080p monitor it looks like I have training goggles on that are creating tunnel vision. I had to search the web to find workarounds for this issue, but could only come up with a quick key binding as a solution. Unfortunately, my FOV continues to reset to 70 every time I mount a vehicle or gun placement. Borderlands 2 doesn't have this issue and allows FOV adjustments in the main menu settings.

PROCEDURAL WEAPONS

While innovative at the time with plenty of stat variation, weapon brand names were not as distinctive in Borderlands 1 as they are in Borderlands 2. Most of the weapon models felt reused constantly no matter what the brand was. The weapon mechanics and procedural system mostly made brand name a stat adjustment. So going back to Borderlands 1 with some brand loyalty didn't lead to any feeling of distinction or difference in tactics. The lack of brand distinction made Borderlands 1 weapons rather shallow with no lore behind them.

Finding new weapons in Borderlands 1 was a rather odd ball inconsistent process of trial and farming. I didn't realize this at the time, but it appears that even a level 21 bandit can drop a level 4 standard weapon. At least in Borderlands 2, the loot drops were very close to the enemy's level rather than so far away. The feeling of reward vs. difficulty in Borderlands 1 is not as good as Borderlands 2. 

There is a slight bug that causes weapons to appear lower in level when equipped. Looking into it further it seems to be related to the proficiency of the weapon type. From what I hear, this is residual left over code from a feature that was canceled at launch that allowed players to equip higher level weapons as if they are lower level. The change has nothing to do with the weapon's function, which concerned me at first when I started noticing it.

STORY AND QUESTS

In a lot of ways, the content of the story and the way quests are handled felt very much like Stalker-lite, but without the immersive element.  Voice acting was limited and the way quests were logged was a bit too simplistic. The compass tracking system was almost useless to me along with feeling clunky. Navigating the map in the menu was also clunky due to how it handled the current active quest. In Borderlands 2 this was considerably fixed up and even optimized. 

The plot was all over-the-top brutal humor with a ton of awkward fun. But was only skin deep, consisting of some villain monologue [which was always hilarious], but mostly instructional dialog by various characters you meet. The characters you meet didn't offer much beyond their initial introduction. There's really no emotional attachments to be had with any of the NPCs. The lack of NPC interaction beyond getting some transmission chatter kind of made Borderlands 1 feel lifeless, which was an issue that was addressed with Borderlands 2. 

COMBAT AND AI

My first impression before Borderlands 2 was actually quite good [and still is], but I've played a lot of games before coming back to Borderlands 1. I notice things now... things I didn't see before that are important to me. 

I've always been annoyed by horribly inaccurate weapons that give me that ""Naked Gun 2 1/2 - Gun Fight"" feeling.  I am especially annoyed when an enemy that is dead center on my scope takes a missed shot to the point of emptying my ""sniper"" rifle.  It doesn't help when you stagger from every single hit you take even if it's a distant glazing blow impacting upon a fully charged shield. Much like Stalker, weapons in Borderlands 1 can be weird and misleading when it comes to accuracy through aiming. This issue was fixed in Borderlands 2 since you can see the crosshair shrink for a moment as you focus in allowing for a more precise experience with an aimed weapon.

Enemies in Borderlands 1 can also feel a bit awkward, but they still have that signature hilarious dialog that leaves you giggling hysterically while trying to shoot straight with an already inaccurate weapon.  AI navigation is a bit more problematic as midgets have a much harder time moving up ramps or even around corners to charge at you. If the navigation was any worse, you would think that you were playing with Doom 1 AI programming. Even AI vs. AI interaction was sketchy at best as the AI would prioritize the player at random intervals without ever checking line-of-sight. Some modest improvements were done to the AI in Borderlands 2.

The enemy spawn rate is very aggressive in Borderlands 1, giving players no real opportunity to truly clear an area before another wave of enemies hit the field. This was a double edged sword as leveling and finding loot was easier to do in Borderlands 1 because of the aggressive spawn rate. On the other hand, if you were struggling in a large area while trying to escape back to the fast travel station, you would be in for a constant wave of ambushing on the return trip. Borderlands 2 toned that spawn rate down quite a bit.

There is one big problem that has not been address in Borderlands 2. There are a ton of bad navigation issues that involve getting stuck on terrain and being blocked by invisible walls on ramps. On several occasions, I'll get stuck on a hill of loose debris or the corner of a small ramp while attempting to kite an enemy.  I really wish Gearbox took the time to smooth out their levels before launch.

CUSTOMIZATION

You get to pick a different color for your character and vehicle. That's it. You don't even get to view your real model when you do the customization - just a 2d portrait is used.  Thus another thing that was totally fixed in Borderlands 2.

OVERALL

Still addictive and still playing despite its flaws, but will likely be logging more hours into Borderlands 2 here soon."
10211,love it
10212,"Amazing game
Amazing graphics
Amazing soundtrack
Amazing psychics
Never gets old
Never gets boring
10/10 would kill Skagzilla again"
10213,Play with meeee
10214,"Replaying this in the Good Year Of Our Lord And Saviour Jesus H. Christ Two-Thousand-And-Eightteen has certainly made me realize that it's quite a bit more flawed than I remember, but it's still a great game and we've certainly seen how it's influenced the FPS-aRPGs that have come after it.

The shooting practically hasn't aged, and while it may be lacking the wider gun/enemy variety of its sequels and games that took beats from it, it's still at least adequate.

On the gun side, while you definitely get a degree of variation between manufacturers, it mostly boils down a difference in stats than in actual functionality as we'd see in the later games. One manfucaturer will have a pistol that shoots at X speed and does Y damage, another will have one that shoots faster but does less damage, another one shoots slow but does fire damage, etc. 

Each gun type generally has one ""special"" variation, such as revolvers that shoot shotgun shells, multi-barrel SMGs, or the occasional unique gun that has a personalized function (such as bullets that zigzag, or shotgun pellets that spread in a set pattern), but these are few and far-between.
The main problem with the more unique weapons is that many of them are just flat out -bad- (except the revolver-shotguns, those things are just plain overpowered). The shotguns with unique spread patterns are often counter-intuitive to actually getting all of the pellets to hit the enemy, 4-barrel SMGs have such wide spread that they're practically useless, rocket shotguns are incredibly underpowered, etc.

If I can give the guns one major credit though, it's that the scaling of strength by item level works -far- better than it does in the sequels. Damage works on a slow linear scale, so while a higher-level gun with identical parts will always deal more damage than a lower-level gun, the lower gun will remain viable, often for 10 levels or more. Compare this to BL2, where the damage was on an exponential scale, and a level 51 gun would deal 50% or more damage than a level 50 gun. Thanks to this, if you find a weapon you genuinely love, you can keep using it for a good chunk of the game without feeling like you're gimping your combat performance.

On enemy variety, while there's plenty of unique factions (two types of humans, a solid 5 or 6 animal archetypes, and the aliens), most groups tend to be a bit lacking of in-faction variety, and fighting more than one faction at a time is a rarity bar for the final area of the game.
Bandits have the best variety, with multiple different sorts of gunner, heavy gunner, and melee based enemies. However, the Crimson Lance, who all but totally replace the bandits during the late game, only have three variants.
Likewise, while beasts like the Skags and Scythids tend to have a large -number- of types, the actual variance between these types is horridly lacking. If you're lucky you get at least one variant with a unique function (e.g. exploding scythids, rolling spiderants), but generally the variation is merely size/health bar, with no actual change in ability. Skags almost form an exception to the rule, by having both spitting and armored variants, but towards the endgame you can expect to be fighting -only- those variants, so the potential for some neat encounter design ends up squandered.

Thankfully, the initial lack of variety is helped a bit by the Badass enemies. They're rarer, tougher, bigger, and often elementally-charged versions of regular enemies, and even just throwing one or two of them into an encounter really shifts the balance of the fight around.
Bosses likewise help keep the experience fresh by presenting some new and unique scenarios. Except for the final boss, who aside from being completely out-of-nowhere story-wise, is both horridly unchallenging and unneccesarily loaded with HP, to the point that on Playthrough 2 the fight drags on into pure tedium.

Bar that one fight though, the encounter balance is generally pretty good. Frustrating, multi-death encounters were few and far-between, but the game still makes sure to throw enough at you that you're challenged.

However, the lack of instanced loot is disappointing. As a result of this playing with multiple people will stretch your resources thinner and thinner as you get the same amount of gear chests, ammo boxes, and etc despite the 2x-4x greater need for it.

On the writing end, the humor still holds up well, it never gets memey and keeps a consistent tongue-in-cheek tone that doesn't feel forced. However, it takes a nearly hands-off approach until you get to the DLCs, with most of the dialogue being in the unvoiced quest descriptions instead of through actual voiced lines, and as a result you may feel a disconnect between the gameplay and story.

Still though, for all the criticisms I can levy, the core shooting gameplay is so fun that it's still a plenty enjoyable and time-worthy game. Try to buy the GOTY edition as some of the best content is inside of the dlc expansions.

10215,"Borderlands is, in my opinion, one of the best games ever created.  The humor, gameplay, characters, NPCs, and environments are all extremely well done.  This game has enough action and easy of use controls to keep the casual player interested while also getting pretty hardcore at some points to give the serious gamer a challenge.

There are very few games that just about anyone can pick up and be playing in no time and this is one of them for sure.  The intro to the game and first few missions do a very good job of explaining how to play and what guns to use in what situations.  The transition into the full on game from the tutorial levels is seamless and before you know it you are done with the first main zone and moving on.

Once the game is finished, you are able to continue developing your character in a second playthrough that scales the enemies up and makes everything harder.  This will allow leveling beyond where you finished the main game and allow you to acquire even better guns.  Add on the DLC and you have a game that can be purchased now for around $10 USD for the GOTY edition that will give literallt hundreds of hours of entertainment."
10216,best
10217,Just buy it. I was really lucky and got it on sale for $7.49 but I would spend $19.99 on it.
10218,"Tons of guns, thats for sure."
10219,This game is a lot of fun.
10220,"A very nice rpg-fps.

+ nice, funny and cruel implementation of a post-apocaliptic world
+ Telltale (half cartoony graphic, design, game etc. high quality)
+ very good music from Jesper Kyd
+ secrets
- not too good multi and post-content"
10221,"Best Borderlands game so far, I own this game for both the Xbox 360 and PC.

Unlike Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel, this Borderlands offers proper modding support. Variating from 3PDLC maps, guns, items to whatever you can imagine really.

I myself am one of the ""modders"" <-(hate that word); let's just say ""creative individuals"" that do their best to keep this game going for years to come.

My work on the game:

10223,"In this, it is open season on a niggas ass ja feel 7.5/10"
10224,"A great game, wonderful humor, great combat, good DLC (played them all on console versions of the game though sadly, so not sure how the PC versions compare) a great cast of characters and locations to explore. The second game improved much upon this already great game. Worth the purchase if its on sale or your want to buy it right away.

Also its worth it just for ClapTrap. <3"
10225,"Extremely fun game with or without co-op, definitely check it out, it's worth it."
10226,"The entire game is loaded with cringe-inducingly unfunny ""humor."" Battles take too long since enemies are all bullet sponges. Loot is extremely lame and the environments are repetitive. Every talent tree is unsatisfying. We played co-op and we were both done with this before we finished. Play something else."
10227,What's not to love about this game. Superb storyline... lots of action... character upgrades... and the weapons. Hours of FPS fun!
10228,"One of my favorite game series ever, I have fallen in love with everything Borderlands. Witty/crude humor, great combat, and loveable characters is what makes this game great.

9/10"
10229,"It's a good game by itself, I guess. A lot of the story is implicit and you have to read a lot to actually get what's going on, because although there's voice acting, a lot of briefing and such simply isn't voiced and is only read. Handling of maps and quests are very awkward. The lack of health regeneration really hurts gameplay. Voice acting and characters are very flat. (Note: I fucking hate Roland and the way he squeals like a little bitch every single time he goes down. Every. Single. Time.) Fight for your life time is poorly done. Animations are lifeless. Aiming sucks ass. Running mechanic is broken. Guns are boring. FOV is very small and can't be fixed. Vehicles get stuck easily and are often unrecoverable. Borderlands 2 upgrades this game in every single way. Don't get Borderlands 1. Its time has passed years ago."
10230,"Best game I never realised... Until Now...

Borderlands appear to be best played with friends. However, I don't really have any gaming friends and I think no one is playing it anymore since this is a 2008 game and I'm only playing it in 2014, so the lobby right now is empty. It's fun, regardless.

Weapon loadout is *Dead Island* confusing... I think Dead Island loadouts were inspired by this... Lots of modifiers to keep each weapon pickup unique and confusing at the same time.

**I should have written this review a long time ago but Steam got pissed at me for getting a refund from the unauthorized transactions that I have been trying to reverse; At least the hacker didn't win this time but my community profile got suspended for 3 months**"
10231,"The original Borderlands and definitely a must purchase for those looking to get into the Borderlands series. Rewarding progression from early levels to the end with an endless stream of awesome loot. The humour of the game is the biggest selling point though in this iteration it mostly comes through in text only dialogue with the occassional rare intro dialogue. This, as the first iteration, is less refined than the later titles but still maintains a high level of replayability and charm.

If you jumped right in to Borderlands 2 you might find this one a little slower paced, quieter and overall less grandiose and stimulating than it's sequel. The violence in this game trends a little more on the ""realistic"" side than the following titles which seems a bit of a miss match for it's comic-book style.

All in all the first entry in the Borderlands series is well worth a playthrough, especially in a GOTY bundle with all the DLC. It lets you experience all the origins of your favorite characters and really informs the humour of the second game."
10232,"great game and another great thing is it borderlands soo what more can i say =]
"
10233,"This is definitely a classic and I still enjoy playing it. I have been a fan of the game since day one. Borderlands is about – finding weapons and shooting things with them! It’s all about the guns: combat rifles, machine guns, sub-machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, revolvers, pistols, rocket launchers, and many that can’t be categorized! Seriously, there are a lot of guns! The gory Mad-Max feel of the desolate planet and the people you meet on your way is the bulk of the story! It goes like A) Go somewhere B) Kill some shit C) Flip a switch or something D) Kill some more shit E) Success! The game is fun! Its like Diablo loot with guns! The NPC characters are hilarious - yammering some schizophrenic one liners every now and then. Choosing what weapons to keep and what to toss is the most difficult decision in the game. Discovering a quality weapon stash is a very satisfying feeling! The four-player coop is the games shining moment! Going on a rampage in the hostile wasteland with 3 friends can be a lot of fun. It just feels good to level up, get new skills, new more powerful weapons! Bottom line is that everyone should have played this game by now!"
10234,"Slower than the second game, the first incarnation is still eminently fun. Indeed, if you're looking for a good time with friends, you really can't beat the levity and wit of the Borderlands franchise. This first game has only very minor issues (and I'm nitpicking): co-op can be unbalanced with different rewards and disparate leveling at times (depending on what your build is, you can level up much more quickly than your mates). Besides that, rare gun drops are few and far between. Make sure you get the DLC as nearly all add to the fun, with the exception of the tedious Moxxi's Underdome. 

"
10235,"Have completed 2 playthroughs, and both have been engaging and amazing, it's easy to go and play this game all the way through on each individual character class and have fun while doing it. Highly reccomend playing with friends as that half makes the experience what it is."
10236,10/10 would play for 5 minutes
10237,"If you're into any type of co-op games, I highly recommend picking this one up. If you're into shooters, I highly recommend picking this one up. If you're into RPGs, I recommend picking this one up. If you like heads exploding, guns out the wazoo, psycho infested wastelands, creatures out to kill you day and night and wub wub, then I highly recommend picking up this game."
10238,good game
10239,Looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10240,The best coop game I've ever played.
10241,"Game Needs Better Terrain Textures, But Other Then That Its A Good Game."
10242,"This game is literally eating up every minute of my free time.  I know it is dated and borderlands 2 is apparently better but I wanted to play this before I play the newer ones...all I can say is goddam, its addictive, almoste as addictive as half life 2 and its episodes and that is saying something."
10243,Swag better combat than borderlands 2 m8 8/8
10244,"Unless you want a game that's just looting and shooting, stay away. The lack of ability to even change out the scopes on your weapons seriously drains from the experience, and while graphically appealing style wise, the game suffers from a lot of pitfalls many other rpgs fall into. So treat it like a team shooter and you'll be fine, treat it like an rpg and you'll be disappointed."
10245,"This is one of those games that if you play it, you will LOVE it. it's fun, brutal, beautiful to see and listen to, as well as sexy and did I say FUN? 
GET THIS GAME!"
10246,GAHHHH BORDERLANDS
10247,Good game. Finishing it with my brothers then moving onto the presequel. The starting area is a bit derped though xD better later on.

10252,Great shooter!!! Lots of loot to sale and some good stuff to keep and use yourself!
10253,"Okay so this game is a good game however it is badly ported onto the pc, there are many guns in this game, millions of randomly generated guns however most of them perform the same, they just generally look different. The graphics could be better."
10254,Great game!
10255,"I could activate my US retail copy of the game on steam.
And the game itself is good fun. Definately recommend it, although you might just want to get the 2nd installement"

10263,"I love this game and franchise. I the first two games on Xbox, I even use sound bites as ring tones. Now that I have Steam I have repurchased so I could introduce my friend to the greatness and joys that come from the world of Pandora"
10264,"This Game is in my top 5, i love it"
10265,"Seriously, this is one of the best games I've ever played. It holds up too, becasue I only purchased and played through this in 2014. 

Pros:
- A great animation style; which I'll admit, did take some getting used to, 
- The fantastic story, 
- The FPS/RPG elements that mix so well,
- And the loot system... OH! The GUNS! So many awesome guns. 

Cons:
- A little difficult in some places.  Some areas are insanely hard.
- Some bosses are way over-powered and can cause many, many, many deaths. 
- A touch grindy. You spend a LOT of time in each area. This is made worse by...
- Areas re-spawn. You clear an area, get to the next, and on the way back have to go through it all again.


But, when it comes down to it, the Pros definately outweight the Cons. It's just a great game. I sunk around 45 hours into this game (including all the side quests), and it was totally worth it. You could probably speed through it in around 30... but it is a large game. So yes, if you're thinking about buying this game... do it. Especially do it at the amazing Steam price it tends to go for these days. I'm now off to play Bordlerands 2."
10266,Awesome game
10267,Playing bumper cars with friends - best part of Borderlands.
10268,"A MASTERPEICE. Although there is some backtracking issues and a few bugs/glitches, everthing else is great. if your looking for a good fps with loot and facemelting, then buy Borderlands.

i would suggest it every time the whole franchise is amazing that ive seen and played

10274,Back to Borderlands after finishing Borderlands 2. Classic game. Like it!
10275,"I don't know why I love this game. It is so totally asocial that it's a little bit sick. But I guess there come times in everyone's life when the only thing that suits your mood is to melt the faces off some midgets with a gun that shoots acid, or set bandits on fire and listen to your character laugh her head off as your victims run around screaming ""Mommy, mommy!"" It shouldn't be funny, but it's as funny as hell. It has some absolutely classic characters, not only in the main players like the siren Lilith, who has a ghastly giggle every time she hurts someone REALLY badly and who will abuse you if you leave her on hold too long, but also Dr. Patricia Tannis, the insane archeologist whose only reflection when a colleague is devoured alive by one of the local animals is ""He always had the more comfortable chair....I took his chair,"" Scooter, who could so easily have become a simple hick parody but turns out a great deal more, and funnier; and General ""Doesn't Like Mondays"" Knoxx, who is condemned to the hell of being commanded by a six year old child who outranks him because of nepotism gone insane. Just don't expect redeeming social value, unless there's some redeeming social value in getting rid of your less healthy desires in a relatively harmless way."
10276,"i played this game to the point of getting bored with it. i did not even think that was possible with a game. and as you can tell, i have 171 hours put in to this game, so i love it. and with all those hours spent i have to say that this is better than borderlands 2

Pro's:
great story 
Fantastic loot system
Lots of memorable moments both offline and online
Amazing gameplay
Lots of replayibility value
Good AI
Awesome music and sounds

Con's
When joining a high level game with a low level character the quests will get glitched and add their quests to yours

overall i give this game a 9.9/10"
10277,I shot a pscho in the knee and he said he would eat my spleen with my eyeballs as a side dish.
10278,"It's something action role-playing game fans looking for an experience more up-close and brutal than genre entries of the third-person variety should have a blast with, and one of the more memorable products of 2009."

10280,"It is ok but what ruined it for me is the cartoon graphics with today's technology that is uncceptable and lazy then to ask for a price than it is not worth!

Overall was boring dont like the overall system, gameplay etc."
10281,"8/10

Gun variety is fun. Open world coop is [i]very[/i] fun. Storytelling could be so much better though, the ending was a complete anticlimax.

Of the 4 content DLCs, only the General Knoxx one is good (but it's very good indeed). Zombie Island and Claptrap are okayish throwaways if you liked the gameplay and wanted an extra time sink on the game."
10282,"The singleplayer of this game is good. You know, it's a first person shooter. Pretty chill, the developers obviously wanted to put the actual fun back in gaming, rather than the typical Call Of The Battlefield Of Honour And Duty franchises which just focus on ""Realism"" (Jumping out a plane, shooting a pilot in another one and landing in it to fly it, yeah okay.) and have focused on a game being FUN, not super cool and slick.

The multiplayer of this game... Fuck me, absolutely outstanding. Playing with your friends is hilarious and frustrating at the same time, so much fun. Just grab a few beers, chill, get a bit of Borderlands smashed out, then wifeswap or whatever the fuck you guys do after you've been playing some vidya.

Or do what I do and get the missus playing with you. Yeah she's shit, but fuck it, it's funny watching your bird get hacked to death by psycho midgets."
10283,"9/10. This is a great game, and I've bought it twice! Definitely one of the best FPS RPGs made in recent years. I would compare it to ID's RAGE but but with an element of slapstick comedy and goofiness that just makes the game work. This is a must buy!"
10284,Recently bought this game and I'm loving it already there is tonnes of levels to achieve along with 4 classes and online play makes it a very good game indeed

There is also enough funny dialogue in the game to make it one of my favorite games today. I am not a serious reviewer, but if you want to have some serious fun, check this game out!"
10294,"After trying over and over to get into the series (playing this and Borderlands 2 on the PS3) I have come to the conclusion that I just do not like these games. I'm a nervous online player and by that I mean I get nervous when I play with strangers online ha. I feel like I should be polite and offer them certain loot but then I end up not getting anything new (which is my own fault). BUT because of my online demeanor it makes this game not very fun to play.Also, playing solo single player got really boring."
10295,its like skyrim with guns without guns with guns
10296,great game all but moxxie campain
10297,"I played this on Xbox 360 day 1, and was blown away. I bought a PS3 along with the game of the year edition the next year and was still amazed by the content, humor, gameplay, and overall writing. Last year I decided to buy a copy for my PC, and it was like playing the game for the first time-- with better graphics and controls, I rediscovered the entire game. I've honestly played through this game +25 times and I still feel like I've never played it before. This game reinvented the wheel when it came to RPG/FPS genres, and will always be my favorite game."
10298,">Borderlands
>A real game

Pick one."
10299,"its a dawn good game
"
10300,"Well, it's not as good as BL2. So I highly recommend to play this game before its sequel. It has almost everything that it's sequel has, just not as good. If you play those two games in chronological order, you won't notice how BL falls behind BL2 almost in every aspect, except for the loot system, perhaps. I finished BL and all of it's DLCs and then I finished the BL2 main story and then I switched back to BL again to play it with my friend, but it just didn't feel that great anymore. The character development and the story felt slow and only after we reached the middle of the game did things start to happen and it was the fun fast-paced action-filled post-apocalyptic experience everyone is looking for!

Don't get me wrong! It's a great game. One of the best FPS CoOps out there. It's just that you need to get pass level 10 to see its true glory.

PROS:
- beautiful, immersing and vast deserted world (similar to that of Rage or Fallout)
- tons of various weapons (even more than in BL2 and without the limitations of what the combinations might be)
- cool upgradable characters (although, IMO, the Soldier's skill tree makes him by far the best, and that's a shame, if you want to replay the game with another character)
- cool unplayable characters
- interesting story; funny jokes
- lot's of easter eggs and secrets to explore
- DLCs worth of purchasing (I would even say that they're better than the main game)

NEUTRAL: less enemies to shoot, which means less action, but also more time for calm exploration

CONS:
- Moxxi's Underdome DLC is too hard, IMO
- It's not possible to complete one of the side mission's in the Secret Armory of General Knoxx, because you can't access the location, in which it's located, although you could before
- 3rd party account/software is required for CoOp
- Level caps and it's not possible to unlock all the skills
- Picking up loot and ammo just by running over it was introduced in BL2; here you have to do it manually

Overall rating: 8.5/10"

FIVE BIGASS FUCKING STARS

10306,Worth ;D
10307,"A humorous RPG with cell-shaded graphics in a post-apocalyptic world.  The action is intense and if you can find a game with friends, then it's even better.  So many different types of weapons, upgrades and different character types can make this game very replayable.  The additions of DLC adds quite a bit to this game as well.  A welcome new series in the FPS/RPG genre."

10312,"this game turns into a meme

rip in peace"
10313,"(Not relevant) At first I didn't really see the point in these reviews but recently have started to find them more and more handy as actual reviewing sites are going to shit, and so for that reason I've decided to join the large crowd writing reviews.

If you haven't heard of the Borderlands series since it's been out, congrats I don't know how, but it's one of the best games I've ever played. In essance it's a shoot and loot game, but ends up being quite a bit more than that with laughs in quite a few places, which are much more reviewed in the DLC. The ability to grind for gear is quite addicting as when you finally get what you've been wanting it makes the (possible) hours worth it.
The game is not without faults, with side missions being more tedious than fun in some places and no ability to make the game harder without ignoring side quests.

Overall I would give Borderlands 1 an 8/10 for being game that I like to just pick up at any time and play for 6 or so hours without noticing."
10314,"This game! While not so acclaimed and rich as Borderlands 2 still is a pearl and must play for evryone that likes:
1. Shooting hordes od enemies with gazzilions of different gun types/variations with or without special elemental effects like corrosive, fire, electro.
2. Looting awesome guns to kill even more hordes of enemies to loot even more awesome guns.
3. Likes to build his avatar - 3 skill trees for each character give enough room to play around.
4. Has a sense of humour and likes a good laugh.
5. Prefferably has 1-3 buddies to play with because this is where each Borderlands game shines since you can use your awesome skills to enhance teammates, however it's not really necessary - you can play solo as well and lots of people enjoy single player aspect of Borderlands.
6. Wants to get into Borderlands franchise - it's a great start in before Borderlands 2 because: 
a) the story the franchise is consisetent and you would be missing a lot of the references in BL2 and BL: TPS which is not something critical for the enjoyment but trust me it gives you smirk every time you catch something.
b) IMHO the loot system is way better in the first establishment of the game. I wish they haven't butchered it in BL2 that much! Don't get me wrong I love BL2 but.. well let's just say it's more interesting.

While it's a 5 y/o game the graphics, animations and special effects are great but of course don't expect a Skyrim quality of graphics. Upside is - it works good on older machines and you can max out graphics on newer machines (woo! ultra quality! ;)

TL:DR - GUNS, GLORIOUS GUNS!

PS BUY ONLY GOTY EDITION"
10315,"It gets a little repetative, but the game is a lot of fun and run super smooth."
10316,Up yours  - if you can't take that don't play the game!

10318,"If you love hack'n'slash mechanics (loot, simple rpg elements) and FPS (the sight of a gun from your right corner of screen, quick action) and coop (playing with your buddie/s against hundred of different enemies) and you are above all that a fan of Mad Max (crazy psycho bandits, vechicle warfare, desert landscape)

10319,"Borderlands was my introdution to RPG FPS games, and man... I love this game."
10320,"get this game guys
"
10321,Best game ever :)))))))))
10322,"I'm a girl that really hates FPS games (I like watching someone else play, especially if the story is good though) but Borderlands...oh God... it's just AWESOME! I love the RPG part of the game, the story, the graphics, characters, humor, everything!  Even in single player mode! ^^
Although most of my playing hours are in co-op (khm... 46hours are just..khmm.. ""official""..if you know what I  mean :angel: ), I really enjoyed playing alone. And when that comes from me - you gotta trust me :P
The best part? While the guys are trying to get in the enemy hideouts all pumped up and ready for action, I clean it with a few sexy and precise headshots.... with my Siren :D

"
10323,"Great with friends, otherwise don't bother. Sirens are incredibly broken op."
10324,"its fun 

One problem to much gun changing"
10325,An amazing example of how RPG and FPS and great sense of humour should be combined.
10326,Great 1st person shooter game... even better when played as multiplayer! I love that the game is long so you don't complete it within a day... plus lots of DLC ... def one of my fave games
10327,Great game.. Challenging and fun.. ;)
10328,"How to describe Borderlands? Genius? Epic? Stunning?
Yeah, all that fits, but still... it does not seem enough.
For me Borderlands is a game like no other. It's fun, done with a huge dose of details, it lets you just hop in and have fun with it but if you want, you can also dig deep into it, to get everything.
An FPS with heavy emphasis on loot collecting, tons of quests, awesome DLCs, multiple playthroughs to do, 4 completely diferent classes, PvP and so much more it's just a game, that simply, cannot be beaten easily.
For me, definitely one of the games of my life."
10329,"How can I start, by far one of the best game franchises i've ever played."
10330,"I watched, as this..man approached me, silent, not one word escaped from his mouth. He looked up and stared at me, deeply, such a cold stare for one to behold.  He raised his hand and it began, with the ground shaking i was confused. what sort of magic is this? without second though i was blinded by a rainbow of orange, purple, and just a hint of blue. i looked away and to my surprise, the man was gone.

(He literately, shows up in my game, and starts spitting up legendarys out the booty. i don't even know how i feel about this.  just..why? thanks though.)"
10331,"Dear Steam and Gearbox, thank you for your latest update! Not only did it reset all my graphical options making it look like shit, now using all my old settings it now lags! Thanks a ton!"
10332,"It's more the rule than the exception for me to only discover games several years after everyone else has got bored of it and moved on to the next big thing, so coming to Borderlands five years post-release is like riding the cutting edge of gaming as far as I'm concerned.  An added benefit of no longer being being remotely challenging for the latest computers to run, so every graphics slider can be ramped up to its highest setting without any real concerns, making even the arrival in the barren outskirts of Fyrstone a wonder to behold.  It's not long before I'm running around firing potshots at anything that moves and constantly running off in the wrong direction just to see if there's a few extra dollars in that green box over there - Borderlands hits my completionist buttons hard, which is why after 14 hours of play I'm still to make Sledge's acquaintance; the 145 hours ""longest"" play posted on HowLongToBeat is looking like an easily achievable goal right now.

However: a significant number of those hours have been as a consequence of persistent CTDs that have led to my having to play some missions countless times - I've spent several hours in Headstone Mine alone after being repeatedly and unceremoniously dumped out of the game.  On two occasions now I've had to stop playing out of frustration, only to find on my return that the game, perhaps in a fit of pique at being neglected, has forgotten the aforementioned graphics settings (not to mention my keybindings) and set itself back to defaults.  Yet further hours have been spent researching solutions in an attempt to resolve the issue: have you verified local content? Check.  Reinstalled drivers?  Check.  Updated Windows runtimes?  Check.  Compatibility settings?  You betcha.  I'm beginning to wonder whether resorting to dancing widdershins around the entrails of a stand-in for Mordecai's falcon companion should be considered a viable option.

So it bugs the crap out of me that I can't give Borderlands a positive review: it looks great, it plays great, and when it's worked, I've thoroughly enjoyed my time playing it; and despite everything I'll probably still keep going back to it.  But right now the only adventure I'm experiencing is Groundhog Day, and that's neither the adventure I signed up for nor one I can recommend to anyone else, especially in a game this old that's never going to get fixed."
10333,"Borderlands

There is so much I can say about this game good and bad, though mostly good. Like for example: The Gun-play in this game is very very good, it is very fun, it can be challenging (especially if you havn't played many FPS's before, like me), you'd think looking for loot would be boring but it isn't, it is always a treat to find a new gun or shield or a grenade mod that you feel suit you better than the last one. 
Another very good thing in this game is the dialogue and the writing, it is absolutly hilarious, if you don't burst out laughing at how fun the dialogue is then I do senserly feel bad for you. It took a few mintues for the game with it writing alone to hook me right on for the rest of the experience. And the RPG elements in form of skill progression is appreciated, especially for one such as me (a.k.a RPG lover).

Unfortunetly there is a part of that game that is severly lacking, and that is the story. What story is there is very basic but  I found that the writing that was there still made it enjoyable. And all the boss battles you'll have along the way are fun. But to give a basic introduction to the story of Borderlands (No Story Spoilers): 'You play as one of four different Vault Hunters who arrive on the planet Pandora (no not that one) to seek out the treasured Vault said to contained riches beyond imagination and you are being lead to it by your ""Guardian Angel"".'
However the ending isn't anything so write home about, it is disappointing and it does bring down the score and as unfortunate as it is it does take away a little from what the game tried to do.

One last thing I should mention before I give my score is the co-op, I highly recommend playing with friends who also own the game. I did this I cannot even describe how much fun it was in the end, but to tell of the co-op. The way it works is that the more players there are in the game the harder the enemies will be, BUT and this is a big but (hence why I wrote it in caps) they also drop better loot. So it will become more of a challenge, more fun and more rewards.

My verdict for Borderlands is a Good game and I highly recommend it to just about everyone as long as you don't mind FPS's or doesn't like playing with others.
Score: Good!

Thought the review was over? No not quite I want to tell you about the DLC's for this game as well. Three of them I would recommend and the fourth only if you like Arena Challenges. The four campaign dlcs are as follows (and the order you should play them in, after the main game).
Dr. Ned's Zombie Island: This is a zombie DLC, but it isn't at all boring, quite the opposite in fact. It is mostly very fun, there is 1 quest that is very grindy and takes a lot of time to complete but overall I recommend it. And even as weird as it sounds a little but more story starts to come forward in this.
Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot: This is a Arena DLC and a very annoying one at that, it was fun for the first couple of hours and the first Arena Challenge ""Prove Yourself"" was genuninly fun. But then the larger challenges was also fun when I started it up but it became boring and grindy a while in. And it never felt like it was worth doing since you gain no exp or weapon skill or anything, the reward for completing the quests didn't feel worth it either. I would only recommend it if you are really into Arena fighting.
General Knoxx Secret Armory: This is what a DLC should be like, adds more to the story, feels relevant and deals with the consequences of the Main Storys ending. It is hilarious as always and as I played through I felt more and more drawn into the world of Pandora (no not that one). Highly Recommended.
Claptrap's New Robot Revolution: The best DLC of them all and part of the reason you should play the other dlcs as well, since the DLC continues to build on the endings of the Main Story, Dr. Ned's Zombie Island and General Knoxx Secret Armory. This DLC truly captures the best that the rest original Borderlands and its other DLC has already created and does it all very well. Highly Recommended.

And finally if you've made it this far down (which I doubt), then I just have one final thing to say: ""Buy the goddamn game already!"""
10334,good game
10335,good game

8 psycho midgets out of 10!"
10338,"I love borderlands 1, its just an unique game, I love pandora on borderlands 1 because its a wasteland, love atlas weapons and S&S weapons and I miss them on BL2, the DLCs are great, its a very replayed game, I 100% recommend it"
10339,Awesome game and lots of fun.
10340,"The original game of the Borderlands francise. The story and characters are extremely bland, but the gameplay is excellent. I think the loot system works a lot better in this than later games and Ned's Undead DLC is great. Sometimes feel a bit too easy. 8."
10341,"This game is great fun. I love the style of the graphics - the comic style will age this game well. I love the quirky characters, and the depressed ones! This game is great to play with a friend."
10342,"Borderlands is a perfect mix of FPS and Diablo-style RPG, and it plays on the strengths of both genres very well.  Basically am FPS that plays by Diablo rules.  

Before I get into that, I should mention the design.  The game is one of the coolest-looking games I've ever seen, as far as graphics design and effects.  There is a unique effect that makes everything have an outline like a graphic novel.  It adds to the feeling and atmosphere of this game.  

And this game does feel like playing a comic book, very much so.  There is a strange mix of brutal, disturbing subject matter mixed with humor, and the two flow together in such a way that you stop distinguishing between them.  Madness is part of life on Pandora, and the game brings that experience home with that humor.  The game stays funny enough that even the worst parts come off as light-hearted.  

The characters are all well-written and well-performed, and just about everyone you interact with is memorable, and sometimes iconic.  You will never forget meeting Claptrap, Moxxi, T.K. Baha, Scooter, or many of the other residents of Pandora.  The characters stick with you.  

As an FPS, the game is a far cry from Doom and Quake, due to the integration of RPG elements such of proficiency and skills.  It is not simply your accuracy with aim that matters, or your reaction time, but your gear, skills, profiency, and experience that decide how lethal and accurate you are.  This is not a stealthy game, nor one that insists you be clever and avoid trouble.  Borderlands insists you wade right in and take what's coming to you.  And that's fine, because you cannot actually die, and death does not make you lose progress.

As a Diablo-style RPG, the game captures the core of what made that game great.  Four character classes, with unique abilities and skills chosen as you level up.  There is a strong emphasis on loot and gear, and death drains your money supply.  The game is made for co-op, like D2 was, and plays better with a group.  But this game does away with ability scores, instead having your gear decide your bonuses and stats.  

I think it is one of the best FPS games ever made.  But it has one major problem.  It's not Borderlands 2, and once you play the sequel, the original will feel weak.  It also is a little short, comparatively, and I'll just say something very unsatisfying about something in the game (I won't elaborate for spoilers).  A flaw the sequel more than makes up for."
10343,Loooooot
10344,It's 'ight
10345,"Beautiful pixel-shaded graphics, interesting story-line and lots of looting. Playing alone is fun enough but playing with your friends is hilariously better. The downside is the sensitivity, which is horrible for PC at least, but overall it's a top-notch."
10346,"It was great. However after playing borderlands 2, it's lost some of it's appeal. Back when I first played it, it was a 10/10, Open world, good loot, good characters, fun, quirky. However borderlands 2 and the presequel did everything that little bit better, so going back feels kind of stale. 

If you have never played a BL game, start here, and the score is 10/10
If you have played BL 2 to death, 7/10"
10347,awesome!
10348,Good old game :D
10349,If your looking to kill pyscho enemies while setting them on fire while killing midgets and giants. Borderlands is the game for you. Plus you can see where the series began. A really fun multiplayer experience but I just wish the servers still had more people. However there's always Borderlands 2 or The Pre Sequel. Still enjoy the first game for what it's worth. The accuracy for most of the weapons is quite off and some of the weapons aren't always worth the upgrade. But with a over one hundred thousand guns to choose from and of course a big open world to explore. Borderlands will keep you busy for sure. If your new to series I think it's good to start off with this one.
10350,"Crazed, but beautiful with excellent co-op feature, well worth a play"
10351,"A must buy!
Bought it at discount with a gmg download code and am extremely satisfied with my purchase.

I'm playing Siren atm and I think I made the best choice too. :)

10/10 awesome game.

P.S. Im playing with a Toshiba laptop w/ HD Intel 4000 graphics which is terrible, but automatically set me at settings which made the game the most playable."
10352,A boss has 3 balls and 9 toes. Work the money!
10353,"One of the best games out there, of you like to shoot and loot then this game is for you. If you are looking at getting the second one, I would recommend playing this one first for more of an oversight on the past."
10354,"Hey, I liked Codehunters, too, Gearbox! I didn't rip off the artstyle to wrap around a morass of acceptable shooting mechanics and horribly unfunny and contrived writing!

Me > Gearbox."
10355,even though it's getting kind of dated it's a really fun game where there's tons of guns and you can make really crazy character builds 10/10
10356,"Well, its not completely terrible, but gun accuracy is a bitch in this game"
10357,"Great game, enjoyed every minute of it but the game has a week story and i was greatly disappointed at the end."
10358,"No need of review, just an amazing game all around."
10359,"This game is tons of fun, I can't seem to stop playing it."
10360,Fun to play with friends. Not so much by yourself.
10361,"Cartoony gore with bad@$$ guns. 30 hours + for just the normal campaign, and crap-ton of DLCs! One of the better FPS games made in the last 10 years."
10362,"this game was garbage all you ever do is run around and shoot retards
claptrap is shit and ruins the game

10/10 would give claptrap a dicking"
10363,"WAIT, YOU HAVE BL2 BUT NEVER PLAYED BL1 !!!
DUDE, YOU ARE MISSING SO MUCH.
buy it, its good.
if you love borderlands 2 you will love borderlands 1.

10364,"when i got this game back in 2009 on my xbox 360, i didnt stop playing this game. now i got it on PC i love it even more. GUN GUN GUN"
10365,"Beautifull game.. Had a lot of fun with the characters. Lacks a little of background story, but still really fun game!"
10366,"Is is worth the money? Yes it is, but I found myself getting bored with the game after a while. All the missions are the same and most of the bad guys are beaten in the same manner. It did not keep my interest for very long"
10367,"Lacking in the story and voice acting department compared to future games, but the guns feel so much better.

Really enjoying playing through this, even solo."
10368,I slept on a dirty mattress in the middle of a sewer 10/10
10369,"Picking up this game for 4$ including Borderlands 2 and all the DLC was one of the best decision's I've made. 

10/10"
10370,"amazing, very fun game to play single or multiplayer, very very fun :)"
10371,"Borderlands is a neww genre-definer. RNG-RPG-Shooter like never seen before! Alas the story is really not even worth listening a single second, you´ll meet some supercool NPCs on your way :) But beware, the DLCs hide the best parts of this game sealed behind a payment-wall :\ Though I´d recommend to buy them as well as the game itself, without them you won´t have much fun..

IF you buy Borderlands AND all DLCs be prepared to have a hell of a good ride :D"
10372,Pretty shit. With emphasis on both pretty and shit.
10373,"Nice game, art style is a plus; single player mode is ok, challenging when you are high level, co-op is very enjoyable, but it is repititive which makes it boring when you get your character to lvl 50. What I'm hoping for is they add new content - like new environments so that players wouldn't see the same setting time after time (barren land), and maybe players can get all skills for all classes, more interactive npcs and player environment."
10374,love the game. First got it on playstation. Than became a steam member.
10375,Play with friends; otherwise this is just an average fps loot fest.
10376,"Give me a review, and I'll show you a review. Apart from some repetitious missions, the gameplay is very solid. This game very quickly became one of my all time favorites and I am glad it exists. Played it first on Xbox 360, then bought it on Steam before I even had a gaming rig to play it on. Played it again with crap graphics on a laptop, which was still very fun, then played again once I build my PC! I could maybe even say it inspired me to build a gaming PC. That would be a lie though (Skyrim). Borderlands still helped :)"
10377,ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES!!!!
10378,"Screamed ""BLOOD"" and proceeded to beat a midget face in and got in no trouble even after i killed the rest of his family. 911/420 would play again"
10379,"I liked that there were so many diffrent gun to collect and trade out, but i didn't like that there were so many fetch-and-return quests."
10380,"This game is amazing. If you love Diablo, then you will love Bordelands. 10 out of 10"
10381,"Do you like Action? Gore? Cartoon Mayhem and a badass loot system? YOU DO!!!
Ok then, you should probably go get this game."
10382,12th Kinkiest game i've ever played... (And thats saying a lot since i've played a lot of games)
10383,One of the best games ever
10384,"If you want a co-op, open world shooter with RPG elements, then Borderlands has you covered.

Good: Borderlands is great to play with friends. You can create a unique characters with your friends, having different abilities and weapon proficiencies. You can run and gun through hordes of enemies, and laugh at the ridiculous stunts you’ll inevitably perform.

Not-so-good: Borderlands can become repetitive, especially if you move through the game slowly. This is compounded if you play the game alone. By the time you complete the last quest, and get into the DLC, even with your friends, it will feel quite grindy.

There is a story, but that’s mostly to provide arbitrary motivation to move around and shoot stuff. The characters are funny when you listen to them, but they don’t stay with you after you put the game down."
10385,"This game has a great look like a  graphic novel, and post apocalyptic storyline which is pretty cool.  But is definitely for the get-killed-over-and-over-and-respawn crowd.  If you liked the unreal tournament style of frenetic, kill-and-respawn play, then this could be the game for you.  The game play is basically a twitch-and-shoot with some RPG and Adventure elements.

Increasing difficulty in Borderlands means you have to shoot the bad guys more times.    Because of this every adversary has a damage meter-- kind of like a boss.  They also never run out of ammo, and never miss.

This is a typical scenario:  A bad guy, or many bac guys,  appear and immediately start shooting as fast as possible-- sounds like a drun roll.  They hit you with every shot, no matter how far away they are, wearing down your shield,  while running toward you at top speed.   If you can get in enough shots to drain their damage meter  before they get there, you may escape without having to respawn. 

After you respawn, those you killled stay dead.  So by getting killed and respawning, eventually you can complete a level.   That is pretty much this game.   I'm really glad I got it on a Steam weekend deal for really cheap."
10386,fun!
10387,"unfortunately, it is not my kind of dish. I feel boring. I cannot continue at all..."
10388,Yea its ok
10389,"One of the best games i have ever played

10390,It's like Diablo but 3D with guns. Also I think I'm having fun.
10391,"I played Borderlands 2 and thought the game was Awesome. So I said to myself ""Why not play Borderlands 1 to see if it was just as Fun as the second game"" and you know what it was. It was a little hard at first but I got the hang of it two hour's in. Now Down to Business Borderlands is a 7 out of 10"
10392,"Just started playing, got this game a while ago and never got into it and I'm fucking addicted.
Get cool guns, find cooler ones.
Be in a cool atmosphere, kill cool things.
Play forever.
If I could I would replace sleeping with hours of some great borderlands I fucking would."
10393,"Awsome storyline and easy-to-play format.  I really enjoyed the characters.  The variety of items wasn't lacking and the challenge, for me, was satisfying.  I've played it through with 3 characters and still playing.  The graphic style is unique.  It was easy to get used to on the PC, great control with mouse & keyboard.  Kudos to the writers, developers, and publishers.  I hope you guys keep pumping out more of this kind of FPS.  This game was thoroughly entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone who craves that ""can't stop playing until 2AM crap I'm late for work"" experience."
10394,"I loved this game. First i was disappointed because you have to read a lot of the dialogue like in JRPGs, but the gameplay, the weapons, the monsters, etc. are awesome. I played this for hours on the PS3 (platin trophy) and on PC. I even bought a second copy for steam."
10395,Amazing Game! Best RPG FPS series.
10396,"Played 40Hrs into this game and completed it in 2 days
[u]10/10[/u]"
10397,"Borderlands probably needs little introduction to most gamers - it is pretty much the apex of action RPGs, with lots of engaging and interesting characters, a serviceable if sometimes basic/cliched main plotline, and (particularly once the DLC kicks in) it can be pretty funny.

The base gameplay can be a little offputting initially, as you generally start with a very crappy gun that doesn't really shoot straight and does little damage, so combat can be a bit of a chore, but once things start rolling it picks up well. Probably the weakest part for me is the loot system - there are lots of guns, with lots of different combinations of abilities and statistics which can significantly affect the weapons effectiveness. This is great of course, except it is all too easy for the game to degenerate into spending disproportionate amounts of time deciding which guns are better, and which you need to get rid of. This is especially true later on in the last couple of DLCs where the amount of big loot chests and how easy they are to get grows exponentially.

The other main weakness is the level straight jacket - you can go to a region a few levels above you and it will be very challenging, but go back a few levels later with the exact same equipment and spending no skill points and it will now be easy. This also means that playing it now really requires reading up a ""playthrough plan"" of when to complete the main story, when to play each DLC, when to start new game plus mode etc., to avoid being overleveled and having a completely trivial time.

On the DLC front - you really want them, the base game is pretty short, and the DLCs certainly more than double the length of the game between them, and generally the are more fun, funny and involving than the base story. The only problems are as mentioned above they can massively overpower you for nearly all of playthrough 2 if you do them immediately after the main quest (or even before then), and they aren't as easy to play in short sessions - generally in the base game you can just do a mission, then save and exit and come back to do the next one next time you have time. In the DLC you always respawn at the start of the DLC, and there are no shortcuts so you have to work your way back to the zone you are up to, or have a bigger chunk of time to clear out the entire zone. Easily the worst offender here is General Knoxx - you frequently have to clear through two zones to get to a third, finish the quest, go back to the start, then have to get back again (or head two zones in the opposite direction)."

10404,It's like if Mad Max had a baby with Cowboy Bebop.
10405,"Borderlands has got to be one of my favorite games of all time. It mixes your classic FPS with RPG elements, so for someone like me who loves RPGs and  also a fan of FPS games it's the best of both worlds. In my opinion the best way to play Borderlands is co-op with a friend or a bunch of them but playing solo is still a world of fun. You start of in playthrough 1 of the main campaign and it has a really nice story and lots of different areas to explore. After you beat playthrough 1 you can go back and play through the campaign again as a highler level making it much more challenging and getting those very rare and powerful guns. My favorite thing about borderlands is the loot. I have spent countless hours farming bosses from the DLC's, Farming chests and overall just trying to get the best guns possible. Just when you think you have the best gun you will always find something better. There are a variety of characters to choose from and once you beat the game twice you can always go back and playthrough with another character. This is a review for just Borderlands but the DLC adds a WHOLE different element to this game which has kept me playing it for hours on end not to even mention the achievment hunting. All in all Borderlands is WELL worth the money and is one of my favorite games of all time. If you have never played it pick it up and you won't be dissapointed. 9.5/10"

10413,"Gee, I don't even know where to start with this game. So, where should I start?

First of all, the story of Borderlands. It has no flaws in it at all (unless you're a twat and you hate Borderlands) and there are soooooo many bosses to fight.

The classes themselves each have their own strengths and weaknesses. The hunter is great with long-ranged weapons and loves picking off enemies with his Bloodwing, but isn't great at close combat or melee. The soldier is a great assault and defence class with his Sabre turret, but not really a sniper of any sorts. The berserker loves getting close up with both shotguns, rocket launchers and his fists (going berserk), and he's a tank, but he does need to get close up to do damage, thus taking lots of damage in the proccess. The siren can surprise enemies with phasewalking and can do well with elemental weapons, and - uhhh, what's the weakness with the siren?

With these classes, there are great skills they can unlock. Headshotting and gaining health; lunging forward and dealing heavy damage; appearing and causing a massive shockwave full of fire, electricity and corrosion - they really have thought of everything to make people happy.

But don't buy Borderlands 2 before you buy this. You need to play this one first to understand the storyline of Borderlands 2, with the vault hunters and Marcus and stuff. Overall, this game is greatcellentasticilliantulous!"
10414,Possibly the Best FPS/RPG game I have ever played
10415,"Great game, ton of replay value."
10416,Fantastic fun. Especially multiplayer.
10417,Great
10418,Borderlands1 and borderlands2 are the best co op games ever made.
10419,"This game has it all: great story, hilarious dialogue and characters, engaging characters, an with a definite rpg feel, tons of loot, awesome quests.

Fun as hell! Not for the squeamish or easily offended, there's lots of gore and adult humor."
10420,"You run.
You shoot.
Good Game."
10421,"Man, I can't believe I didn't write a review for this game.  I can't say it enough, this game is hilarious fun.  With many 'WTF did they just say?' laughs, with many explosions to walk away from, mind you don't step in the meat loot chunks.

Probably the most fun you could have with three friends while keeping your pants on."
10422,"This game is very good, about world texture. Here you can play with other palyers, and You can kill anyone.

Will be a lot of blood.

Have fun. :)"
10423,"Filled to the brim with content, an amazing game with a brilliant story to go alongside with all the action. If you are into FPS or RPGs you will probably love this game."
10424,Good game. Lots of guns. FUN
10425,"Very perky and yet desolate FPS and RPG, moreso a FPS than an RPG. Contains many, many references to pop culture. Overall, it is a parody of life itself. If you enjoyed a game such as Portal, or its sequel, you will love this game."
10426,Great game and really fun to play as Mordecai and be an assassin.
10427,Great game to play with or without friends. An engaging story line full of humor that is sure to bring you and your friends closer as you slay the creatures of Pandora and discover the secrets of the Vault. A timeless adventure that never loses value.
10428,Four people who have no real solid background in the borderlands search for buried treasure while killing everything with a plethora of advanced weaponry and techniques. I think the WIP name was Cortez's Adventure? 11/10 would bullet again
10429,"Great game, great game engine, and great single-player to multi-player crossover system."
10430,classic
10431,"A comical story, many different playstyles, tons of guns. Borderlands is a fun FPS that you will enjoy. 8/10"
10432,"this game is still active , online works, and its priced at very good affordable price. i love it, its still a very playable game and steam makes it easy to grab this bad boy up :D"
10433,So... Many.. Guns... It's... Beautiful!
10434,You looking at Bloodwing?
10435,Borderlands: Hoarders' Nightmare. 10/10.
10436,"I'ts a awsome game, you are free to go because i'ts a open world, you can even play with your friends and have the fun of you life, and if i was you i shall buy it now!"
10437,"the Original, and still playable after all those adds & sequel/prequels.  trekking through the desolation, it really does seem a bit lonely at times, and then something is trying hard to kill you.  Great fun with friends and the occasional stranger."
10438,"Great port, great performance, great keyboard controls and above all, extremely fun.
You just can't hate on this game. It is flawless doing what it aims to do: killing a bunch of enemies while looting as many weapons as you can.
Plus, there's the puns, bad jokes and funny gags that make this game hilarious.
9/10"
10439,"Brilliant and also throwaway. No story worth mentioning, but collecting guns become a gamers crack cocaine. Would have given it 80%, but a completely flawed save system corrupted my high level Hunter, with absolutely no way of recovering it (no .bak files, no multiple saves).

Such a poor game design choice it makes me sick. Bioshock Infinite may have had no profiles, but the saves were all backed up automatically (literally dozens). Gearbox really let the side down on that front, and I know I am not alone in this frustration.

Great for multiplayer, jump in and kick ass."
10440,"Played 12hrs game is ok but music is so fucking horrible 6/10.
This gets boring after 5 hours straight.
I would and would not recomend

EDIT:
Beat the game would now give it 5.5/10 end boss is a bag of wank
Music still fucking annoying
Overall its good and bad.
I still prefer BL2."
10441,"I felt the incredible Borderlands-game-feeling (that I know from the 2nd game) during playing the 1rst DLC.
The DLCs are the bests.
Also;
STRIP THE FLESH
SALT THE WOUND"
10442,This gmae is really good I highly recommend it to all my friends... to bad i odnt have any
10443,If you like watching midgets running around howling in pain as they slowly burn to death then this is the game for you!
10444,guns guns guns
10445,shoot em up...
10446,Addictive rpg shooter that does get repetative after a while but you just can't stop playing.
10447,"Borderlands serie is a must. Love the genre. The graphics a Comics like, the story is correct, Everything drops something Woaaaa!!"
10448,2K and Borderlands is like what milk is to chocolate. You can't have one without the other. Great game best FPS Role Playing game there is even now. RPS.
10449,WUB WUB WUB WUB
10450,"""OVER 87 SQUIDZILLION GUNS!"" -FLEEP - Squid RIP"
10451,Good times family fun for the whole family
10452,"Pretty Simple Review: Guns, explosions, crazies... what's not to love."
10453,"[b]THIS APPLIES TO ALL BORDERLANDS GAMES[/b]

[h1]A damn shame.[/h1]
First of all, it's painfully obvious this game is ported from a console version.
Most if not all of the GUI is based on keyboard input. On a console, pressing ""A"" to accept a quest makes sense. Having to routinely press ""Enter"" on PC does not. This is unfortunately prevalent in the entire game, which makes for a less pleasant interaction.

Naturally, that alone doesn't ruin a game. My biggest problem with Borderlands is that your character's performance is largely if not completely based on [b]random and erratic[/b] item drops. Your character's firepower and durability increase rapidly throughout the game. As a result, you might find the gun you have found to be completely insane and overpowered two hours ago to be worth next to nothing. The importance of decision-making is [b]practically nonexistant[/b]; it seems to be based entirely on random chance. There isn't a notable learning curve and aiming doesn't seem to play a big part; once you reach a certain level it doesn't really matter anymore.

Moving on, it seems like all the games in this franchise haven't got much to offer beyond shooting the same type of enemies over and over, while the enemies and your weapons keep steadily getting stronger. In the end it all comes down to simply shooting, moving, and running in the same scenario except slightly different every time. 

[h1]TL;DR[/h1][list]
[*] Bad console port
[*] Completely luck based
[*] No skill, no decision making
[*] Awfully repetitive
[/list]"
10454,"What can I say. Well worth the money and the story line is amazing, never a dull moment when your shooting heads off psyco'"
10455,"This is one of the worst games I've ever played, and the only one I've ever fallen asleep while playing.
It's constant praise and success baffle me"
10456,"         While borderlands 2 and the pre-sequel are mechanically superior in every way, there is something about the original that keeps me playing it to this day.
         The original is, in-fact, so broken that it actually benefits the game. Glitches like General Knoxx's armory actually increased the lifespan of the game, and the absolutely overpowered character abilities and guns were extremely fun to use. I remember the first time I found an anarchy smg ( an smg that shoot 4 shots for the price of 2) or a masher revolver (a revolver that fired 7 pellets at once), and when that gun completely melted everything in its path, i felt like a complete badass. borderlands 2 may have had much more interesting skills and far less buggy mechanics, but the complete insanity of the original just can't be beat.
          Borderlands also helped popularize the ""looter-shooter"" genre, and without it, you might not have seen games like Destiny, Firefall, or The Division be the way they are. if you are in to either RPGs or First-Person Shooters, try this game, it is an experience. (God damn I type too much.)"
10457,It's a pretty good RPG.  I hate skags.
10458,Its okay could be better but its a old game so they tryed
10459,"Awesome Game- 

Worth the penny"
10460,good game 5/5
10461,"I could only ever recommend this game if you have people to play with. Not much in terms of story and can get quite boring playing solo. Gameplay is solid but lacks any motivation. Since the sequels, you probably won't have much luck finding someone to play with. If you do, buy it when it is on sale."
10462,"Online w/ friends = 11/10

I recommend this game if you want to try a RPG style in a FPS, was really funny, a little difficult at the start because of the accuracy rates and that, but with proficiency and that got the problem solved

Loved this game, and want to try out the sequel and the Pre-sequel"
10463,"One of the best games I've ever played. Good music, great atmosphere, good jokes, funny moments (CL4P-TP, cutscenes, character introductions..).
People say Borderlands 2 is a great successor of this game, but I think different. This has more good jokes, less bad memes, better enemies, better map design, better story, better characters.

The bad things are:
-Too much invisible walls.
-And they patched so there is no way you can create impossible weapons. Like the peashooter. The modded weapons weren't even made to make the game easier, they were made to make the game more fun after the 5th playthrought. No dmg weapons that can knock everything off the map is awesome! And we managed to find a cube below the map. We knocked each other there. It was more fun than the game, and they made it impossible to do it again... But you can still create instakill shotgun, and infinite shield, so it didn't even stop cheaters."
10464,Great game!
10465,I love this game. It's CoD's and Diablo's baby. One badass baby.
10466,"So where should i start. First of all Borderlands are one of my most played and favorite games. I will do this quick so.

Pros: 
Funny kinda black humor.
Unstoppable action.
Long main story even much longer side quests which arent repeating.
Something like RPG system. (levelup,skill points etc.)
DLCs
Big but seriously BIG firepower. (guns duh -.-)
You can play it over and over again.
Sympathic playable characters. (except Roland (im not racist btw))
For PC its in my opinion one of most simple and greatest co-op game.
Soundtrack
Bosses
Challanging

Cons: 
10% of bugs
In some places, theres kinda deppresive atmosphere cause nobody is arround you like you are totally alone, no npc etc..
Only one kind of car (with dlc 2 kinds) 
Someone can find this game Hard
There are two mods one is normal and second is after mode where you will start over story but you will have all youre guns and experience from normal mode but what i want to say Normal was too peacefull for me and theres horrible loot and things like these so for me to enjoy borderlands on 100 % is only in the aftermode.

Well if i should decide ill give this 10/10."
10467,its good
10468,love it
10469,this was good game
10470,"I've played this originally using the GOTY version on GameSpy, then converted it to STEAM after GameSpy went offline.
The basic game worked ok, though the DLC:s had a repeating habit of crashing in some places, eg: inside Dr Ned's house in Zombie DLC; at a specific enemy vehicle spawn point on the highway in Knoxx DLC; in a cave with respawning birds in the Claptrap Revolution DLC - causing me trouble getting past some stages until I turned off all ingame videos, which seemed to cause most of the crashes.

One issue this game has is multiplayer, a host mission list overrides any joining players lists, and can totally mess up the respective mission sequences for the others. Best practice is to always play characters with the same missions available, or to never join anyone further ahead than yourself.

I played this game with several characters in order to test the skills/abilities for each class; this proved to be another source of problems; In the GameSpy single-play version I've often found my savegames for one class overwritten by another characters latest savegames, and it seems this is worse in the STEAM version, as so far, I ALWAYS have to restore another characters save when having played the STEAM version.

The GOTY DLC:s have been another issue in the STEAM conversion, my saved characters have all activated them already, but the DLC:s need to be reactivated manually in steam, as a separate product. (Adding another few gigabytes of download, even though I had them already).

When the game works, it's a nice slow FPS (compared to Borderlands 2), with alot of loot & guns to gawk at, maybe even overwhelmingly much. Single play could become tedious after awhile, and multiplay tends to mess up the missions if one isn't careful (Borderlands 2 improved on the latter).

There is also no difference in the misssions for the different classes, so once the game is played through with one class, there is little/no incentive to do it again with another class."
10471,Teh seks.
10472,just...wow....
10473,"Bought the GOTY edition for 2€ on a local flea market, thinking ""this is old, but I read some good reviews about it"". Best purchase I ever made on a flee market up to now; this game is great fun playing co-op with friends! Single player is kind of boring compared to the Co-Op mode though. It may not be the latest game, but the comic style graphics don't go out of style.

Since the second successor of Borderlands is already coming out, I think that 20€ for the GOTY on Steam is really overpriced. However, if you get it for a few bucks like me or at the Steam sale, you should definitely give it a try with your friends."
10474,"Bought retail GOTY edition and used the Borderlands tool to get it on steam. Awesome game - awesome stuff. 

Thanks Valve."
10475,"Great game with some fun exp. packs. I don't seem much replay-ability, unless you want to try it with everyone's different skills."
10476,"Oh man, what's not to love about this game? Quirky and raunchy humor, high action, and a very fun, fast-paced campaign really round out this game. Four playable characters and a fully costomizeable skill tree for them really allows you to fit to your niche in the game. My first playthrough I played Roland (the Soldier) running a more Infantry/Support build and it was fun. So much fun. 

I strongly recommend this game to anyone who loves unorthodox FPSs."
10477,"Great game, but the ending is a little anti-climactic."
10478,Started looting. Didn't think I would be hurting anyone. But then the loot wasnt enough. All the money wasn't enough. I began to kill... Then I got good... And borderlands is pretty cool too.
10479,Great Game would always recommend!!!! 9/10
10480,"Every now and then a game comes along that is so simple and addictive that it affects the way that video games are made forever. Games like SimCity, Populous, Dune II, and Doom all changed the face of computer gaming for years to come. Now Gearbox, the company that refined worst company ever, has unleashed Borderlands, a title that combines the elegant simplicity of an action game and the addictive storyline of an adventure game with the personalization and exploratoration of an old-school RPG.

As with the golden RPG titles of yesteryear, Borderland's premise is very simple: Find evil things and fuck them repeatedly. The tricky bit comes in deciding just how to fuck them, and how to do it without getting seriously killed. Each of the game's four character classes - the muscle kkk, the edgy rogue, and the hot ass fuck sorcerer - has a different approach to combat. 

Cooler still are the amazing variety of items, magic, and monsters encountered while tackling the game's many quests. Like Sword of Fargoal and The Wizard's Crown (old, old, OLD, RPGs), Borderlands features magic items and weapons with random powers and properties.This means that players going back for their second or third shot at the game will very likely fight opponents they haven't seen before. Talk about replay value.

All and all Gearbox confirmend they Wont make a sequel.

2/10 THANK GOD!"
10481,"One of the few games i regretted buying...especially full price. Bought into the hype and had plenty of friends to play with ,it seemed like such a good idea, but then we all actually started playing and i realized how crappy this game really is. The levels are pretty much the same locations recycled over and over again, the game is sorta free roam but not really, its not like elder scrolls where you have a big open map, its more like dragon age where you have 3 paths and you choose one; and im not saying path options is a bad thing in a game like dragon age, im saying its bad in a game like this where your choice brings you to the exact same ""wasteland""...and your choice makes no real impact towards the overall adventure isnt this a RPS (roleplayingshooter?) whats the point in playing a co-op RPS if there is no randomization in levels or story, the only thing thats diffrent/random are the guns which are just reskin after reskin with minor statline changes <----seriously some times they JUST change the color of the gun is that a joke? billions of guns my ass more like billions of skins.

customization is limited to your skill treee, so its not like your going to get new gear or outfits just new guns. (Yes i am aware you can change your character model color) Story is pretty much non-exsistent in this game, because your making your own story with your friends going through predesigned levels and ""events"" i guess? Ill be honest there could of been a story in this game but i have no idea what it even was, nor will I ever want to know. 

I cant believe they came up with calling this game a RPS, no this is not a RPS, thats like saying call of duty is a RPS because you pick between a sniper with ironlung perc or a machine gun with juggernaut (dont play much COD so sorry if  thats a bad example but im assuming you get the point) This game is essentially Diablo with somehow less of a story. You (and your friends!) walk along paths, kill enemies, get guns, sell guns, buy diffrent guns, and repeat. If thats all your looking for in a game then Borderlands is perfect for you, me im looking for a bit more substance. I felt like I could of gotten the same level of depth and enjoyment with possibly better game mechanics playing one of the halo campaigns co-op, and i dont care for halo...

There are two somewhat redeeming quality I see in this game and one is its art style. It was fairly originial at the time and broke the norm of video games which i liked. But even this redeeming quality has a downside because to me it seemed like the developers used this ""art style"" as a excuse to be lazy and create undetailed and boring wasteland scapes that will grace your eye throughout the entire game. I played fallout 3 and new vegas (yes new vegas is pretty bare bone wasteland but it makes up for it with great gameplay) and I loved those games so dont go telling me that ""its a wasteland its supposed to be plain""  because thats no excuse. The art style is used well in creating city/towns, buildings, and most importantly characters/creatures, they feel comic book like and like they are part of this diffrent universe.
The other thing I think this game does correctly is its boss fights. Based on the gameplay mechanics the game has created they do a good job creating challenging boss fights that often require some planning/tactics or groupwork.

I just dont understand how this game has spawned so many sequels and how it has become so popular, all I get out of this game is a co-op fps with diablo loot system, if thats all your looking for in a game then i guess buy borderlands"
10482,Kill Bandits. Loot Item. Complete Objective. Repeat. Totally Recommended
10483,I found Rakkinishu. 11/10
10484,I LOVE THIS GAME !!!
10485,"Aah, Borderlands, the original manic, comic-book like game about gun lust and excessive, pointless shooting. I've put so many hours into this game I can't even remember where most of them have gone. Even without ever playing the DLCs, I've played this through multiple times and never REALLY been bored. 
There's certainly a lot of content in the singleplayer game, but being able to take a friend into all that craziness opens up a whole other spectrum of fun and friendly rivalry. Pop-culture references and a unique art style along with often amusingly disfunctional NPCs really tie this game up nicely for me, and keep things entertaining as you progress.
Better balanced than 2, somewhat shorter and unashamedly silly. Apart from some occasional sound hiccups you'll have fun with this."
10486,"The original loot 'n' shoot. They did a really good job of making the guns feel distinct, which is really cool, because you could very well find a gun that no one else will ever find. (the gun stats are generated). Because of this, you get really invested in the loot, because much of the good loot is unique.  The characters are super memorable. The  visuals are pretty wierd, but it suits the game. The coop is pretty good, as it attempts to be a seamless transition from single player to coop. There are some issues with players of different levels, but this is the first game that I know with this style mutliplayer, so i'll go with it. I feel like this game really influenced how people make shooters, and for that, I recommend you play it."
10487,This game wasn't that fun for me but I played it alone. I did finish the whole game though so I guess I can't complain.
10488,Awesome game
10489,"Boarderlands is what happens when a developer actually decides to makes a more then decent first person. before i continue i have to ask 2k, what kind of dark magic did you use to craft this fine peicof a game and can you share your secrets to other companys as well. 

Boarderland is polished and refined, shoing of a copetent leveling system, sports a colorful array of high tech wepons, and sports a campaign mode that outstrecthes call of duty, battlefeild and metal gear solid ground zeros combined. 

The only gripe i have is that it falls into the stand behind cover route of gameplay

9.9/10 Boarderlands rest assured you will have your place in history"
10490,"It took tons of hours with tech support to get it to work. What a let down! Poor graphics, bad gameplay. I will never buy another Borderlands game."
10491,"Haven't gotten alot of play time but here goes...

|Pro's|
|-Great Story line
|-Funny Characters
|-Shit-ton of Weapons (around 84 million)
|-Lots of loot

10492,Awesome game set on a post apocolyptic planet with awesome enemies and weapons.
10493,"I love Borderlands. A lot of people I know played the second one first and hate the first one, but I played this one first and I loved it. It's very different from the second one, but shouldn't games be? I love this game and I love all the characters, I'm glad I got in the Borderlands fandom, it's taken a lot of my money but I do not regret that decision. 
This game is fun.
"
10494,"Borderlands, amazing game.. put tons of hours into it but I would move to Borderlands 2 for a bit more updated and a different story."
10495,"One of my favorite games ever, randomly generated guns can be amazing, i liked all of the zones.
only thing that could make if better for me would have been randomly generated zones :)"
10496,It's ok
10497,"Super Awesome game, amazing graphics, badass weaponry, Lots of loot=Brilliant game"
10498,Absoulte must have. Brilliant game from cel shaded graphics to a playground of destruction. I have just completed this game and there is still so many more hours of carnage and fun ahead. 10/10
10499,gg
10500,Amazing game so addicting.
10501,"I've put 30 hours into this game and about half of those were fun. The rest was me lying to myself that I was having a good time. Now, I'm throwing in the towel and admitting that this game is just plain boring. Fetch quest after fetch quest, kill this many guys, collect these items, kill this bounty. Sort through useless loot over and over.  My last few hours of the game were spent trying to complete missions as quickly as possible, running past many enemies and just not being tactical at all, this made it a bit more fun but the overall experience is pretty lackluster and not very engaging. Its a decent way to relax because the game is so mindless but mindless activities can grow boring pretty quickly.

There are better games out there and better uses of your time, skip this one. Hell, getting some friends together and playing dead island is even more satisfying than this."
10502,Collect guns. Kill things. Collect better guns. Kill bigger things.
10503,good game
10504,Game sucks so freaking bad
10505,"Borderlands has a handful of choice features on paper, particularly the general fusion of RPG and FPS and the 4-player co-op directly integrated into the single-player campaign. That all said, it lacks polish, and in practice it amounts to far more pop culture references and arrow comparison than is warranted. For all my complaining, mind you, I sank several hundred hours into BDL, so read that how you will."
10506,"Deez gaem iz so fun, I lyk it , fool 0f awsum"
10507,"Awesome combination of FPS and Diablo style loot system. Tons of fun, lots of content and also a blast co-op"
10508,It's good.
10509,"If you've played Borderlands 2 before this one, there are quite a few things that might annoy you, but once you adapt to those little things you'll find the same excellent loot-based FPS as Borderlands 2."
10510,Fantastic game!!  Must Play!! I am a Fan of all the BL games!! Also pre odered the Pre!!
10511,"Borderlands feels like a classic game to me like Bioshock or Half Life 2.Of course,it is only like those games in the sense it is a FPS.Borderlands can be considered a free roam if you take it technicaly,but dont expect just cause that im saying this it means huge open worlds.You just arent forced to follow a level,but there is not much exploring.The game has an interesting story and it embarassingly reminded me of Star Wars meets Indiana Jones.The guns are epic,and the classes play very well to their powers and abilities.(as long as you upgrade them.).I dont recommend playing this game if you like 3rd person,because this is obviously an FPS.Very good game."
10512,*
10513,"I love playing this game! I am not sure what it is but this one sucks me in every time. Something about the way it is built. FPS with leveling and objectives. IDK, I always have fun with it."
10514,"This game feels like it had far more effort put into it than its sequel. It feels like theres more unique weapons, more things are overpiwered (makes it more fun than balanced stuff) and it just overall feels better. It is a bit dated, but this one feels like it had heart and soul put into it where the sequel feels like it was just made to be a sequel."
10515,"awesome game dlc has tons of content
"
10516,"Really cartoon shooter, lots of fun enjoyed the storyline and gameplay i like the different looks of the guns & characters you can pick with their own unique special move and talent tree. took my a bit to complete the storyline after that i went to borderlands 2."
10517,It took me longer than normal to finish this game as I did get an opportunity to play through a large length of it on the Playstation console years ago.  When I finally jumped back into it with a buddy of mine on the PC version - I found a game that had aged extremely well and lots of enjoyable/memorable Gun FPS RPG moments (what a mouthful).
10518,"The original, still an amazing game. If you want to save a few bucks, grab this over the new versions. 50 hours later you'll have a few other newer Borderlands games (2, and the prequel) you can buy to continue the Borderlands thirst."
10519,"This is one of the few games in my library that I can 360 noscope in.Just warning you.
I 360 NOSCOPED A SKAG RIGHT IN THE TESTACLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Then I proceeded to beat a midget in the face with my swag bird.
He was on fire after that,of course,so don't even ask.
I killed Hella skags with a pink pistol,and my Pistol swag increased.
So then I decided,""Hey! I'm a bad*ss! I'm going to 360 noscope a raider right in the d*ck with a rocket launcher!""
And so I did.
After that, I ate breakfast with the hot siren chick. And f*cked Hella b*tches.
So the game kept saying,""Bruh,do your freaking quests and stop f*cking Hella b*tches.
So I beat the game on Swag Mode.And Micheal Bay gave me an award for exploding the map with my EPIC JOHNSON OF SWAGALICIOUS DERPATRONIX MC-HELLAB!TCHF*CKER!!!!!!!!!!
And that was my experience.
(No drugs were involved in the making of this review.)"
10520,"I got the feel for the game a while ago. It's different. It's a little more raw then others. ""Raw"" meaning it's cruel humor and a little messed up so those of you who are twisted individuals would love it."
10521,"This game lets me set people on fire using a machine gun and frankly thats all I really wanted out of life. 
10/10"
10522,"Brilliant game. Sunk many hours and playthroughs into it and haven't got bored of it yet. Love the weapons, characters, enemies, and just the general feel of the game.

... can't think of any downsides."
10523,"""Overall, the game is quite fun. While the story and graphics probably won’t keep the hardcore FPS player engaged, the RPG elements and the loot certainly will.  If you are someone who enjoys playing video games and feel that the people on the show “Hoarders” have nothing on you then you may want to give this a look.""

10524,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. Do you like finding loot in your games? Then this is the perfect game for you; you will have so much loot you won't want to see any more for a week, but then you will find even more. At one point, after I had already leveled more than one character to the maximum level, I lost all my save data; I was mildly dissappointed but then I realized that I had to play through the game again and I would be able to go through the excitement of finding all that wonderfull loot yet again. I have since leveled multiple other characters up to the maximum level and I have played through the game more times than I can count. I would reccomend this game to anyone and everyone."
10525,"Incredible, if frustrating, first person shooter. The early game is far too difficult, but if you can get over that hump you're in for a lot of fun.

My #1 complaint: the default FOV is way too small and there's no in-game way to change it. It feels like I'm looking through a soda straw. There's a mod to fix this, but it's flaky.

Oh, and the DLC DRM is annoying and broken, too."
10526,"Actually it's aweosme , and buy awesome I mean awesome"
10527,"I picked up a copy of Borderlands when it was on sale because of the fairly decent reviews. In terms of gameplay, I was expecting a fusion of FPS and ""RPG"" level grinding, but I was also expecting some depth to the game.  Unfortunately, it felt like pure level grinding with no purpose aside from increasing the numbers in your character stats screens.

My main gripes are that the game gives you very little sense of purpose and no sense of accomplishment, unless you enjoy obsessively finishing quests and gaining more experience/money/stats/numbers/loot.

I played for about four hours and only ran into two soulless human NPCs who gave me quests, and they felt exactly like the electronic jobs posting board that also gave me quests. A quick Google search reveals that the game only has about 20 or so NPCs, including boss characters who say a few lines of dialog before you kill them. Also, all of the ""merchants"" are actually just vending machines that regularly update with newer weapons and shield units. Without any remotely compelling dialog or characters, I felt no sense of purpose aside from checking off another quest from my quest list.

The game promises a ton of guns, and you definitely get lots and lots of guns, but since you're constantly getting slightly better loot, there's really no feeling of accomplishment. After you beat a boss, you'll get a new gun, but within a few minutes, you'll find a slightly better one on your next quest. The game rewards you so frequently with loot that it very quickly becomes meaningless.

Constantly upgrading your guns is important though because the enemies in the wastelands endlessly respawn. Crates and chests also constantly refill with more stuff. No matter how many times you clear out an area, the enemies will always respawn and crates will always refill, again giving you no sense of accomplishment.

If you really, really enjoy games that offer tons of level grinding, then you might love Borderlands. If you're expecting anything even slightly deeper than endless grinding, then you'll probably find Borderlands to be incredibly boring."
10528,"Just finished Borderlands. And it is safe to say I'm definately going to move on to the sequel. 
I was rather apprehensive about playing this with a gamepad on my 360 / PS3. And I have to say I'm glad I waited to play it on PC. 

The controls are pretty nailed and solid on start up. Only thing I changed was putting my Melee on Mouse-3. Personal preference. 

The Narrative in Borderlands (In my opinion) Isn't extremely important to have a good time. I usually dislike RPG's with quite a passion. However, The RPG elements in Borderlands work absolutely perfectly. I played through with a Soldier, And mainly maxed out my 1st skill tree, Which definately worked for my single player walkthrough. My university lecturer reccomended this game to play with friends, However, If you do want to play solo, It Isn't broken in the slightest. But destroying things with 4 people would have been a great blast. 

The loot system in this game is incredible. Never once did I feel like looking at all of the loot was a waste of time, And I was very excited to see what I would find every time something dropped. Even when Half of it actually turned out to be useless. 

The solo campaign took me about 17 Hours, and theres 100's more hours of sidequests which you can do. So its safe to say this game definately isn't lacking in content. 

My only gripe about this game is I'm a massive soundtrack nerd. And the soundtrack in the game is rather bland and samey, Which for me kinda sucked, But thats nothing when you put it next to the awesome gameplay and comedy. 

Would reccomend to at least play through once. 

8/10 Claptraps."
10529,"This is the very best co-op First Person Shooter I have ever played. Despite being a little old, the game still plays amazingly! Giving hours upon hours of unforgetable moments, I could not recomend a better game."
10530,Also God-like...
10531,"The place where all cartoon violence started. Campaign with all of the DLC is too long, also there are lots of missions of the same type.
8/10"
10532,"FPS + RPG = BORDELANDS
FREAKING BADASS GAME"
10533,funnnn
10534,"This game requires alot of dedication to complete and is more difficult than its sequel. If you are thinking about buying it because of how much you enjoyed the second game then in comparison you will be disapointed, however if you came here becasue you wanted to play this before you bought the second then you will thoroughly enjoy the game and be geared up to play the sequel.
My opinion is that this game takes alot more effort than it is worth and you are better off playing it with friends rather than alone because all you will want to do is give up if you try to play it lone wolf, but i would recommend this game to someone who is playing the series for the first time.
Overall opinion 7.5/10
Oh and the weapons are awesome."
10535,Play Mordecai or Lilith to win.
10536,This is the best game I have never played 10/10
10537,"An enjoyable game with quite a high replay value, mixing in the different playable characters and the variations of available items you could play it through a few times without getting bored. This game also has some of the best value DLC based on content/price.

- 8/10"
10538,Robbing dead bodies is all you do.
10539,
10540,"What happens if you combine Diablo-style loot dungeons, Ghosts 'n Goblins difficulty, MAD magazine and Albuquerque, New Mexico?

You get Borderlands."
10541,This game is one that is most epic when it comes to a trip with the famous clap trap himself! recommended.
10542,Fantastic Co-Op game with drug addict simulation in the form of rare loot drops. Funny quirks and memorable jokes imbound. Who doesn't love a trash talking robot with emotional problems and 4 protaganists who were all probably serial killers at one point?
10543,The most accurate portrayal of Texas ever seen in a video game.
10544,"Borderlands is one awesome and unique experience, one FPS par excellence. Great comic-like graphics, interesting story, humour, original classes, hundreds of sidequests, thousands of weapons and upgrades, huge maps, all kinds of enemies and mini-bosses...
You can play this game solo, but playing it with friends is where this game shows true potential.
Really worth to play. Two thumbs up."
10545,"The start of what continues to prove to be the greatest game series out there. I love this game, and all others in the franchise. Well done guys."
10546,Tell me... Why is this game so damned fun?
10547,I don't normally like playing level grinders but this game is extremely well made with a great sense of humor.
10548,"Awesome game, it's one of my favourite games now. There's a lot to do in this game. You can play this alone, but it would be better to play it with friends."
10549,"Pros:
*AI is decent, but not overly complex.
*DLCs are fantastic.
*Gameplay is challenging at the beginning, but it started to ease later on.
*The random generation of weapons with over 60,000 combinations makes this game very unique, it should be in all games.
*Atmosphere is fantastic.
*Story is interesting.
*Humour isn't lacking in this game, prepare for laughs.
*Enemies look awesome.

Cons:
*Graphics are badly optimised.
*Characters sometimes have glitches where their mouth either moves weirdly or not at all, when speech is definitely being received.
*Sometimes clip on the map for no reason, been killed by this a couple of times.
*Sometimes explosions occur from barrels for a second time after they've exploded, this has killed me several times (no enemies for second wind).
*Multiplayer is a bit strange.

Overall: This game is bloody brilliant and has the fun factor, I would recommend to anyone, it has flaws (what doesn't?), but overall it is very fun and playable."
10550,"IT's a very fun game, I really enjoy playing it.
Always a good choise of variaty and nice shottings whit a lots of fun.
And It's like and RPG.
"
10551,"Very witty, tonguein-cheek humor. I actually beat the second game before playing this one, but still am enjoying BL1."
10552,"I LOVE this game, but I recently switched from a PC to a MAC. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE release this for the MAC!"
10553,its amazing
10554,"Played 35h as hunter/survivor, pretty fun. Nice visual, doesn't require a good pc, boss/mini boss useful drops and really steampunk. 7.5/10


Pros: Second Wind will save A LOT of your money in game; Big map; Fast travel; Mordecai's reactions to his own crit/kills (laughing or taunting); Good rewards for loot scavengers; Useful passives; Balanced weapons and trademarks (hyperion snipers still rare); Really good OST; Good controls; 

Cons: Quests might turn into something repetitive; it takes a lot of hours to find a new good weapon to replace your main/secondary; shops rarely have some interesting item to buy, they work better as ""loot selling points"" than ""equipment upgrade site""; Human bosses don't react to melee ranged shots (don't know if it counts as a con, neither would I); Few cutscenes; Final boss (Destroyer) isn't so good, lack of good drops and poor mechanics; Sugests DLC; Sometimes quest radar might not be accurate;
"
10555,"If your looking for a mindless shoot and loot, this is the game for you, if you are looking for anything else...it sorta sucks.

5.1/10."
10556,"Great game play, graphics, and story line.  Simply a Great game."
10557,A lot of fun! Glad they are running the servers again so that I can play with friends!
10558,"While not especially unique, the gameplay and pace of Borderlands combined with a great multipayer experience makes it well worth a now very low price.  Merging action RPG and FPS, the gameplay can be challenging and rewarding as both your accuracy and reflexes are tempered by your loot.  7/10 solo 8/10 with a friend!"
10559,"Boring fetch quests can't keep me interested.

Boxes of cash everywhere, trash piles contain ammunition clips and even the dog-like Skags drop clips and money... really? This is just lazy."
10560,"FPS shooter meets Diablo.

Do you like FPS?

Do you like Diablo?

If yes to both then I would highly recommend. If a mixture...well it is a bit of a gamble if you will enjoy.

Quality game with amazing CO-OP. The sequel is superior."
10561,terrible game by terrible people
10562,IT. IS. AWESOME.
10563,"hell of alot of fun its already a few years old and i still like it <3
I'd still prefer this over the other 2 games even with its lower visual quality and simpler story than the others it still holds as one of my favourite game"
10564,YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
10565,"I think Borderlands is the first game I can think of that actually requires multiplayer campaigns. The first game's story, at least for me was barely interesting. If I played this alone I would have been disinterested to the point where I would have given up on it and given this a thumbs down. But company makes it worthwhile and a memorable experience.

10/10 Would buy 3D loot simulator"
10566,Yes
10567,"Awesome game, played all trough it. defenitely unique. 

Pros:
GUNS GLORIOUS GUNS

Cons:
Guns to glorious!

Haha 10/10! would play another 100h! :D"
10568,"While overshadowed by its successor, Borderlands 1 is still a fun FPS RPG with excellent co-op."
10569,"Borderlands is one of the best shooters I've played, combined with my favorite gaming style of RPGs. Worth days of endless fun with so many different guns that you never know what you'll get! Even if you beat it all on one of the four characters, it's worth it to play again as someone else! Best with a friend, but fine alone. Good luck to all you vault hunters out there!"
10570,"You must play this game with friends. I slogged through it on xbox by myself before and I felt so bored. Now i am playing with a friend via lan and we are having a blast. Other than that, great loot mechanics, fun humor, and awesome dlc."
10571,"Just stellar. The art style, first off, being the most noticable, is unique and adds to the atmosphere. I especially love the linear story, yet still able to do what you want, within reason. Other games, it's pretty easy to get sompletely distracted doing something completely different (Skyrim, I'm looking at you) and it's nice to just stay on task sometimes."
10572,"If you like the leveling system of WoW but always wanted the gamplay in first-person shooter perpective, this is the game. The guns are random drops and the rariety system is even the same. Also, while the story is not the strongest, it is one of the funnier ones I've seen. The sequel is actually even better, but this game will have a special place in my heart."
10573,best games to hangout with friends great value for money .....highly recomended....
10574,"bored..(er) lands.

Here's my rant in list form 
#1. You walk so FUCKING SLOW. Like 2 miles a hour. 
#2. ALL the quests are repetitive, boring fetch quests. 
#3. The weapons are weak as hell and you can find yourself running out of ammo constantly. This aint fallout 3 bro.
#4. That robot is autistic I hate it 
#5. the weapons are inaccurate as hell..  Blackkurate I aint some gangsta i a white boy why cant i shot str8?
#6. the vehicle controls kinda suck a bit
#7. I'm too bored to make it past 10 hours of gameplay and i had it for years
#8. glitches LOL
#9. they want $20 from you to waste your life doing nothing relevent 
#10. Because for $20 I can get skyrim"
10575,"Borderlands is the first PC game I ever played and there was one day I played fro 16 hours straight.

It's campy, fun and you can play co-op if you like an added strategic challenge.

You should but this game."
10576,"Really great game. At the start it may become a little bit stale, but after you loot more and more awesome weapons the game really shines. In my opinion it has the best loot system in the series that rewarded exploration rather than grinding.
In any other aspect Borderlands 2 is far better. DLC packs are extremely enjoyable, so you might think to pick up the GOTY edition. If you prefer 1 by 1, I'd avoid only Moxxi's Underdome, since it is separated to 3 arenas with 3 difficulty levels where you kill a lot of people but you don't get rewarded accordingly. Still fun for half an hour."
10577,This game is REALLY fun.
10578,"Played the shit out of this back in the day on Xbox 360. Looking back on it now, it's held up quite well. The humor is still great, the gameplay is still awesome, and the story is still highly enjoyable. However, I can't really play games I already beaten at least once. So this game on my computer wasn't played as much as it was on my Xbox. Well over a hundred hours were logged into my Xbox version. 

As a shooter, this game is a MUST HAVE. The sheer variety of weapons and enemies keeps the game fresh and fun as the game continues. The story and characters are all loveable, and I don't have a single complaint about any of them. Not even Brick, my least favorite character, but still a great character.

Conclusion: 9/10 
MUST HAVE. Complaints about the graphics but that's cause I'm used to BL2 style."
10579,"Has land and borders, as the title says"
10580,"Unique, groundbreaking, and most of all, extremely fun.  Combining a Diablo-like lootfest with serious FPS chops and a real sense of humor, Borderlands is one of the best games I've ever played.  Anyone who hasn't played it or the sequel owes it to themselves to check it out."
10581,"Borderlands. Great intro vid rare in games today the vid intro is what I would say one of the best parts for my experience with the 2009 hit from Cage The Elephant ""Ain't No Rest For The Wicked"" first time I watch it a year ago I am like ""Oh yeah I used to hate this song but now I am digging it and it's fits so perfectly with the game's settings and all"" etc. Anyways the intro vid is what grappled my attention so well but asides a video the game itself is just......MARVELOUS. This is not like Bioshock for those who have played that form 2KGames. This is Borderlands it's own game. Very originnal and you can get endlesss hours of fun and gameplay either by yourself or with others. THis game is one of those few games that asides great comic effects and visuals the MP is actually worth every cent the game is. The MP is where it's at the SP is good too but the MP is what makes this game epic. This game is like a much more graphic version of Serious Sam and less serious than Mad Max series. I would reccomend this game to anyone literally especially those looking for challenge, in depth gameplay, lots to do and MP based gaming. The Game should run decently on almost any pc for my HP G56 laptop it works like a charm on lowest settings but the game is best on a real gaming pc etc. Game itself is a 9.5/10 in my book only lacking a few settings and optimization options. But this is amongst my favorites and is not overhyped like many other games. THis game is a lot like the films: Mad Max, Titan A.E., Heavy Metal 2000, Heavy Metal (1980), I am Legend, Escape From NY, Treasure Planet and other post-apocalyptic films. This game is centered on one of four characters/classes, a Siren, Soldier, Hunter, and Brick. Each one has it's perks and downfalls, but the game is mostly the same experience just certain things easier and others not. Anyways amongst the four whichever you choose gets a random vision/message from a mysteirous girl/woman, to instructions to getting to the mythical but real vault treasure of the planet Pandora which is filled with wonders, and Loot. The point of the game is to be alive, kill bandits, and to get as much loot as possible and of course get the mythic treasure for yourself. The game is a lot like Fallout 3/New Vegas, Serious Sam kind of themed but it's truly a full on original fun experience with a lot of comical relief compared to the any of the examples mentioned beforehand I mean this game is filled with humour and it's good in general. One of the few FPS's I have respect for since it's not a COD or anything of the sort all in all the game is a hit, Fresh, and just a truly amazing game in general the sequel is even better on almost every aspect must have game for everyone!"
10582,"Pretty nice game, but for my kinda taste a bit too monotone. Desert, Loot, Desert, Loot .... c:
With friends it's kickass, but alone you will get bored pretty fast.
Personally I like part 2 way more :D"
10583,"An excellent blend of run and gun action and loot collection. Think Serious Sam meets Diablo.  This game really shines when you join up with fellow vault hunters and take on some of the challenges Pandora has to offer.


10/10"
10584,"Better than most games of 2013 - 2014.

11 / 10"
10585,"Borderlands is a shoot and loot game which is just fantastic. It has good story and has loads of guns to collect. I recommend buying this and Borderlands 2, they are both brillitant. (this is coming from a very pesamistic guy) There is only one problem, FIX THE FOV GEARBOX!!!

Rating
5 1/2 stars (out of six)"
10586,"give a borderlands copy to justin beiber and you won't hear a song from him ever again.!!

10590,"[h1]A super funny and entertaining RPG-FPS, best played with a friend in co-op campaign!

9/10[/h1]"
10591,"Shoot and loot. At the time, Borderlands filled a sweet spot that to that point had only been satiated by Diablo II. With its cel shading and co-op gameplay, I spent way too many hours and playthroughs on Pandora.

P.S. The Secret Armory of General Knoxx is one of the best pieces of DLC I've played for a game."
10592,"i am in love with this game .
i played borderlands 2 first , i never really played through it - but when i started playing borderlands i never stopped gaming. if you love tonnes of missions , comic style, loot, enemies and funny and ironic dialoges than you HAVE TO game it . the dlcs are also worth it , i played the Dr. Ned in i guess about 3 hours and it was amazing ! 
i know many people say , borderlands will not get better , but i am lookng forward for october -
since then make sure you gamed the first title !
MAD MOXXI IS ON"
10593,A combination of FPS and RPG that goes to the max and making it four times better with cooperative multiplayer.
10594,I love this game
10595,fun and enjoyable
10596,Good game!
10597,Great co-op fun.
10598,"If you like FPS games, but also want a game with a good sense of humor, this is the game for you.  Slightly twisted, but overall good fun.  Not for the kiddies, though, it does get violent."
10599,"Good game, the sequal is better."
10600,"""You gonna squeal before we cook ya!"""
10601,"This game is a lot of fun.  I played Borderlands 2 first, and there are things I like better about each (better classes in BL 2, better quests in BL 1).  Overall I'd give the game an 8/10."
10602,"""Look at the cute dogs!'-Famous last words"
10603,mad game. has controller support to
10604,"very fun game have been playing for years,so glad that the steam work is going again to be able to keep playing with my friends."
10605,"very good game, full of fun, with friends is great!!"
10606,"One of the best FPS of this kind, awesome in cooperation or alone, there's a possibility to play it up to 4 and complete all missions together. The DLC I enjoyed the most is Mad Moxxi's Underdome.
A lot of final bosses and a very interesting plot (I don't like the ending though as most people do, but Borderlands 2 is there for that). If you love a good mix of FPS/RPG, grab it now !"
10607,"You kill stuff and items randomly drop. You shoot a guy point blank in the face, but due to low gun accuracy, you miss. You talk to strange people and get sent running around the landscape to kill things. It's pretty much the standard MMORPG meets a standard FPS. A good game but superceded by Borderlands 2."
10608,"unskipable cancer, long and boring intros... yeahh"
10609,"Game with lots of humor, guns and EXPLOSIONS! It's great."
10610,"One of the best RPG-shooters I have ever seen. Excellent and original with a lot of dark humor and a fantastic loot system. I played alone and it was still amazing the first time. If you play co-op it gets a thousand times funnier and better, more because of the loot that improves in games of 2 or more players. A must-have in your steam library.

Portugues:
Um dos melhores shooters RPG que já vi. Excelente e original com bastante humor negro e sistema de loot fantástico. Joguei sozinho e ainda assim foi excelente e estimulante. Se você jogar em co-op vai ser mil vezes melhor, ainda mais pelo fato do loot ser sempre melhor em grupo de 2 ou mais. Um título ""must-have"" na biblioteca da steam."
10611,"this game is so overhyped. the actual gameplay is clunkly and boring and frustrating. plot is inexistant, mobs are dumb overpowered and you will die A LOT of times crushed like a bug against enemies the same level as you, or even under. grenades system sucks, it requires a kinda good aiming but the aiming of the game game is so random you never know where it will go. 

the weapon sounds and global feeling is utter crap it feels like shooting with guns made of paper. the accurary is HORRIBLE. you can litteraly spend 100 bullets using a snipe and not hit your target standing just in front of you because it will never go where your crosshair is. there is a recoil + knockback + wind + gravity system that should not exist and that renders the game so damn frustrating to play because no matter how good you aim, the bullets will not go on the target. great for a said hack'n'slash game to put 20 minutes for a single enemy. so at last you just end rushing into enemies with rifles and smgs at short range because aiming is USELESS in this game

the chars are so unbalanced, some are way better than others, as well as the abilities. take a look at the siren's phoenix : it boosts your stats and xp gain when you kill an enemy, and give a chance to not use bullets when shooting. so ? it lasts only like 3 seconds, which is clearly not enough to kill enemies in time, so you don't even gain from the -very small- XP bonus. rush into lower level enemies ? the XP gain is so small and the bonus is useles if you don't want to let all the loot on the ground

it's okayish to 'play' while doing something else, like listening to radio or watching something at tv, but it miserabely fails at being a game because there is nothing such as fun"
10612,"Absolutely love this game. Great value for money. Excellent graphics, gameplay, humour and sound."
10613,"I had to write my first review for this game.  I am relatively new to PC gaming and was looking for a unique game to get.  Borderlands was definitely the game I was looking for.  This game blends several gaming genres so perfectly.  Sometimes FPS games can be so similar to one another.  It is very hard to innovate in the genre, but Borderlands pulls it off.  Borderlands is one of the original and one of the few FPS RPGs around.  It is truly a game that feels like its own.  There aren't many other games out there like it.

If you like FPSs, RPGs, Action, or Adventure games, then I highly reccomend getting Borderlands.  It is a great single player game, and is even better to play with friends.  If you want to play multi-player, but don't have any gaming friends, I would reccommend Borderlands 2 however because there aren't many people playing anymore.  There are some, but not many.  You do not have to play multi-player in order to have fun in  Borderlands though.

The weapon loot system is absolutely amazing.  Be prepared to get addicted to gun farming as there are few things as satisfying as finding a rare, powerful gun.  Choose from different classes with different strengths and choose where you want to go with your character as you level up and get new skills.  You can become more proficient with certain weapon types depending on what weapons fit you and your character.  

Like MMORPGs, there is a questing system in Borderlands which fits so well into the game.  Along with your main quests, each area has tons of side quests to complete as well to help you level your character and earn special rewards.  There are also many achivements to help you earn experience to level as well.

The game of the year edition comes with several DLCs that are well worth it.  One of which gives you a banking system to store your weapons/items which is extremely helpful.  Borderlands is just a great game through and through and I couldn't reccommend it more."
10614,"So… Borderlands… Or how the vault cult began…

[b]Short review:[/b] If you love loot, then your loot senses should be tingling!

I started playing, because I fell in love with BL2 and at some point I felt like I want more of it, but already had it all (if that even makes sense!).
I already knew what to expect from the game, but I was curious how it all began, I wanted to know how BL2 was better than its predecessor, so I got into it. The typical storyline, character story, dialogues and missions I knew from BL2 were already present in Borderlands and as expected I loved them all.
While playing the whole game and its DLCs, I felt like Borderlands is way slower to play than the second game.
I think that if you’re used to playing co-op and you play Borderlands on your own, this will most likely result in boredom. I mean… How can you laugh at a duel when if you’re not playing co-op?

[b]Contras:[/b]
Depending on your graphic card, you may not have Steam Overlay.
I’d say that Borderlands could become quite boring if you play by yourself. Didn’t happen for me, but I generally prefer coop games, so I seldom play any game solo. I’d recommend playing Borderlands with friends though – sharing the experience is always more fun.

[b]Pros:[/b]
I had a lot of laughs and Borderlands is generally funny, but humour is highly individual, so this varies with the player. As already said – I love the dialogues and the playable character’s lines (Brick’s simple desire for ‘MORE!!!!’ made me laugh more than once).
Ragdolls can be sooo funny! (and yes! That’s definitely a pro point :D)

[b]DLCs:[/b]
The available DLCs are a good addition to the main game in general and of course if you’re an achievement hunter, then the DLCs are a must have.
If you don’t care about the achievements, then you shouldn’t buy and play [b]Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot[/b]. This DLC is basically waves of enemies and killing them not only doesn’t give you any XP, but also doesn’t count for any of the challenges.
The other DLCs (The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned; The Secret Armory of General Knoxx and Claptrap's Robot Revolution) are quite fun until the point you decide to go for achievements. Trust me when I say getting all [b]Claptrap's Robot Revolution[/b] will take some serious farming.
What I felt like really unnecessary was the looooong driving in [b]The Secret Armory of General Knoxx[/b]. I know the DLC introduced new vehicles, which is great, but the decision about the amount of driving should have been left with the player. What I try to say is – more fast travel stations would have been better.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
If you look for logic, then look somewhere else. Why? Because [b]BORDERLANDS[/b]!!!!!"

10622,"This game is a chore to get through. This game represents a lot of what is bad in MMOs without that pesky ""always online"" requirement that MMOs have. Co-op is fine, but at its core, Borderlands is a slog of the same three quests laid end-to-end for several hours until you finally hit something resembling an ending.

The sheer amount of padding this game seems to employ is atrocious, with only a few NPCs with names and even fewer with unique character models. Any class in this game that can't handle close combat is going to have a rough time. Though having a sniper rifle is fine for getting those few baddies from a distance, it's a much better plan to have a shotgun ready for those that will rush towards you with no regard for their own safety.

The difficulty curve in this game is a mess. You might have trouble with a few of the early bosses until you manage to get a few better weapons, but by the time you hit the endgame and eventually the final boss, you can so easily be overpowered that it takes as much as aiming the mouse and clicking a few times to beat the game.

Perhaps the sequel improves on a lot of the problems of the first, such as a random loot system that is seriously out of date, but the first entry in this series is easily skippable."
10623,Not as good as Borderlands 2 but worth the buy and has even more loot than BL2!
10624,Great game to introduce people to gaming
10625,Just all around great fun. Feels like Fallout 3 with a different sense of humor :D
10626,"A great Co-op Game, (Even without Splitscreen). Was very Easy To Transfer GFWL Version Over To Steam."
10627,"Borderlands is a bit overrated. The game is actually pretty mediocre when played single player; the enemies and environments simply aren't interesting enough, and the gameplay doesn't feel as dynamic as more recent shooter-type games which I've found more enjoyable. While the guns and the characters can be funny, the game as a whole didn't really thrill me.

It is supposedly better as a multiplayer experience, something I believe based on my experience with Borderlands 2, which is is a bit better and a bit more interesting than the first game."
10628,need more guns.
10629,"This is one of the greatest games of all time. If you like to shoot and loot, there is not a better game"
10630,"If you love getting all kinds of loot then this game is great, for me tho the world felt empty and the story wasn't interesting enough for me to bother finishing it even tho I attempted to finish the game 3 times, but having to force yourself to play it isn't a good sign."
10631,"Glad I found this game, they should push the style even more with an artist's control rather then just some cheap filter tossed over it, needs that good old fashion hand touch, imo.  They should push the humor even more too, (original too) The bot seems like a rip off of Ger from Invader Zim. With that said I'm looking forward to the second game and the prequal after that."
10632,its pretty much fallout in space with more guns and different characters
10633,"Pretty fun. Kind of dated today, but was great when it first came out."
10634,"Evan personally bought this game for every ♥♥♥♥ in the Skype chat except for me, virtually forcing me to spend $30 to play with him and asscake for 3 hours exactly one time. Borderlands is in the same tier as Fallout 3 in that they are basically the same game and that they are basically the same queef of a giant ♥♥♥♥cunt

I still periodically text Evan and he sometimes sends me back a single word reply"
10635,"What is there to say that hasn't been said about this game? It's got a huge variety of guns, and a huge variety of targets. Bringing co-op (or sometimes a lack of) boosts the level of fun greatly, and I think it's bound to be better now that the online multiplayer has been fixed."
10636,"One of the most addicting games I have played. I dont think there can be anything else like Borderlands. 
If you love Guns, Booze, Women, and blowing stuff up Get it! 

I also Strongly Recommend buying the Second game too."
10637,"Played with three friends for hours. Far too many of those hours were spent in impromptu car wrestling matches. 10/10, would mess with wonky car physics again."
10638,"I highly recommend this game. This game never got old for me and is alot of hourless exciting gameplay.
"
10639,Want to shoot things and get loot so you can shoot even more things?  This is your game.
10640,well who has not played this game? its exellent.
10641,"Was able to convert my Retail copy to a Steam copy using the Borderlands Granting Tool.
Out of the box Borderlands doesnt run well. This was easily resolved for me by modifying UseVsync from false to true in the WillowEngine.ini file.
It is an all round great game with impressive art style graphics & challenging game play."
10642,"FPS meets RPG in a fast paced fun game.   The stylized graphics are great, and the  game has excellent humor to it.  Classic for sure. 

Plus, midgets.  Lots of Midgets.

Be sure to get at least DLC 1 (Zombies), 3 (Armory of General Knoxx), and 4 (Claptrap).  2 (Moxxi's) is more of a teamplay thing and insanely difficult solo, although it does give you a bank to store stuff in.

Im coming into the Borderlands series a little late, and am kicking myself for not checking it out sooner.

10/10"
10643,"Bit of a basic layout compared to the second one, however brilliant game that will get you addicted for hours.  Variety of dlc gives an added bonus."
10644,Awesome
10645,my penis grows strong when i catch this shit tonight 69/420
10646,"Do You looking for shooter designated for co-op strictly? If You say ,,Yes!"", thenk think about buy this game. Solo campaign is not bad, but with the pack of Your 3 friends it will turn into massive festival of loot, enemies, and of course - fun! :D. I know, it's a 5-years old game, and doesn't look good compared with newest one, but if people are returning to play this again, again, and again, then it's must have something making them to do that, right? Latest migration form GameSpy to steamworks are a smart choice, most people, who buy this game earlier (just like me), can still play without worrying about it. (thanks to The Borderlands granting tool!) If You want to get this one, buy the GOTY wersion, these 4 DLC's are worth well it."
10647,"best if played before borderlands 2. both games are great if standing alone, but they are so much better if played in order"
10648,"Uninstalling this game due to steam always showing ""update required"" on my downloads list, when I purposefully turned updates off."
10649,"Boom, headshot.

Need I say more? It plays beautifly on a keyboard or gamepad and the graphic style is unique as ever."
10650,"I wrote a review in 2011 for this game. Those were better days, and in those days I might have had the patience to give this game a 6/10 or something.

I've come back to re-review this since a new title in its series is coming out.

Borderlands is not a game I can ""recommend"". At the same time, it's not a terrible game. It's mostly a game to just screw around in, like downloading SWEPS for Gmod to test them out and then going ""that was mildly entertaining"", then not doing it again for a long time. You can have some fun with it, maybe for a little while, but you know what Borderlands doesn't have?

Any incentive to keep you playing (unless you have a fascination with ""loot"", a term Borderlands has re-defined). It may be more fun with friends, but you should be able to enjoy it alone.

You're put in an environment that lacks a lot. You get to travel around this environment and maybe to a couple of snowy places and caves. That's about it. This is obviously the most fun with friends, but enjoyment will begin to fade very quickly in my experience. This mainly boils down to three things:

*Minimalist stories are fine. What's NOT fine are the sort of stupid ""quests"" that games like this, just about any MMO, the new Fallout games, Far Cry 3 and whatever else you can think of that has these, where you're instructed to go pick something up/blow something up/mark something/collect flowers/whatever so that some dude who is non-essential to the story will give you some experience. You can have these if you want. Games like GTA have these, but they're optional. In Borderlands many actually constitute the story, and it gets boring. You don't feel like you're a part of something bigger, like some warrior alongside other warriors. You and three other people at most are just looking for treasure. That's it.

*Visuals/sound/aesthetics. They're on par with many games from the time and are not necessarily bad, however they play into the whole component of it not holding someone's interest. In the largely similar areas of the game, you're not really astounded by a great soundtrack and ambience, awesome sound effects (which is important in an FPS), you're just seeing and hearing the same things but slightly different. Same goes with most of the enemies, and it all couldn't be less original. This is a mashup of post-apocalyptic environments and ideas we've seen before time and time again. I think it probably goes without saying that there's probably not a single game that's 100% original in this regard, but this one barely makes it past 30% or so.

*Guns. This is the biggest problem. There is very little diversity in many of the weapons of the same class. You'd expect ones from the same in-universe manufacturer to look similar, but when one by a totally different one looks the same, it's just boring. Often the difference between one gun and another may be that it's a different color and has a slight physical change, i.e. a different handle. There's more diversity in the performance of the weapons, but it still feels redundant at the end of the day and it feels like they could have done a lot more to make them more interesting. They're not all particularily satisfying to use too, especially in the FPS/RPG hybrid formula. Though I feel this game got gunplay better than something like Fallout 3 (fond memories of watching blood fly out of an enemy's head as my bullet passes through it and they don't even flinch), it's still not that good. Ocassionally something like the Elephant Gun will come along and that'll be fun for a while until it becomes worthless shortly after and you might have to wait a while to get a better version of it.


So yeah. It seems to have no evolution ultimately, no ambition, no meaningful story and an experience akin to how a friend of mine describe Skyrim: ""It's fun for a while, but you eventually realize how shallow it is."" Feel free to disagree.

The biggest issue for me with this game is that whole ""go here, get this, come back"" thing. Almost every game that gets compared to this has that. I've played only two that don't, and I seriously think devs should ditch that nonsense and just have levels and a free-roam or something."
10651,"Little words needed. GAME GOOD. Game VERY good.
You get game!
Game is like Fallout 3 + RAGE only RAGE = $#!+ but Borderlands just feels like these 2 titles but holds it's own as a unique title.
Now BUY Boarderlands and search forum for good settings (you edit .ini file game even better)
Why are you still readig this review? You have no options left, buy game, install game, PLAY!
But first read forum for graphic tweaks.
REALLY you are still here! GO get the game already!"
10652,<3
10653,"The first game of Borderlands series is a great alloy of Diablo and first person shooter. Click, loot, levelup - old good formula still works great despite unusual genre. All sweet joices of many diabloclones are here - money dropped from any rat, tons of randomly generated weapons and shields, skill trees and different character classes. And this is awesome addition to your typical FPS.

What is bad about it is endgame balance. After the first playthrough values of affixes are too low to allow comfortable farm. WTF, I even wore the same sniper rifle from 37 to 64 level because there was nothing better dropped from enemies or sold at the shop. Lack of interesting DLC makes highlevel play kinda boring too. You have to choose between the same locations from original game or vast and monotonous locations from DLCs (however, Moxxi's coliseum is hilarious). This reminds me Torchlight series, where the first game was like prototype, and the second had many issues fixed and way better content.

Still, this is great game if you want grab some friends and shoot, but tired of playing Left 4 Dead and Team Fortress (but maybe it's better to look at the second game of the series)."
10654,awsome FPS but i recommend you play co-op mode however if you are a solo player this game will be quite the challenge but it is fun to play so you will have to be very experianced in FPS genre games but it is worth playing personal rating 9/10
10655,best borderlands imo
10656,What happens when you put RPG stats on FPS guns? You get 20 extra hours of menu gameplay with your team mates. Stand around awkwardly while everyone vends!
10657,"Good Writing, Good Gameplay."
10658,STill an amazing game.
10659,I just blew up a guy with a sniper rifle and made a million dollars by selling guns...10/10
10660,"its great
"
10661,<3
10662,"Very nice and addictive shooter with RPG elements in a Mad Max-like world. If you like cell-shaded graphics, this might just be the game for you. Also lookout for Borderlands 2 and the upcoming pre-sequel!"
10663,AWESOME GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10664,HEY YO!
10665,"I just love boarderlands, its hardcore, fun, funny, and the replay factor is great."
10666,"This game is an absolute blast! If you're wanting a game where you can shot things, have a laugh every now and again and lot al maner of weapons, then this is the game for you. Enjoy! :D"
10667,SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
10668,"The story could be better, but who cares? There's more obtainable guns in this game than there are enemies."
10669,"One of those games that are going to be remembered in future generations. Awesome from start to finish, with humour and good plot. Multiplayer is recently back online, now through steamworks, so it is easy and fun to arrange multiplayer games with friends or strangers."
10670,"This is a game devoid of substance and personality. Everything is brown, everyone moves extremely slowly on these large maps, and every quest is dull and repetitive in this silent world. Just skip this and play its incredible sequel if you're interested, don't worry about missing out on the story, this one has none."
10671,"I've always hated the artwork, but, I gave the game a chance and now I love it!"
10672,"This is a VERY FUN co op game, great classes, weapons, character mods and hours of fun, has New Game+ after you beat the game!"
10673,I have three different console copies of this game and I still love it.
10674,"This game is just a helluva fun put together, it has lots of elements seen in other games: Call of Duty, Fallout, Halo... etc., yet the gameplay still feels unique and fresh.
The sequel, Borderlands 2, has made a lot of improvements, and in general is a better game, but it was the original Borderlands that set the humorous tone and established a successful formula: explosions, loot and addictive fun.
The ""loot"" part is arguably the best part of the game, I've finished the campaign years ago, yet I always come back for more.
Now that Gearbox has released the Steamworks patch for Borderlands to restore its multiplayer, would you kindly pick up this timeless classic, and share the fun with your friends?"
10675,"Here it's where it all started. Borderlands 2, the sequel is a critically acclaimed FPS but it all started with the first iteration of the serie. Beneath the surface of a graphic heavily influenced by comics and with an ironic subtone which accompany you for the whole game, hours of fun are hidden in this rare gem of originality. Four different classes to play with and a Main Story interesting (and absurd, but in a positive way) enough to keep you glued to the screen until you finish the game. I have played the whole game solo but, as I discovered in BL2, the game really shines if you play it with a friend. Get. It.

+ Interesting Storyline
+ Characteristic Sense of Humour
+ Fun to play
- Lonely, if you haven't a friend to play it with

8/10"
10676,"The loot doesn't suck.

10/10"
10677,loved it then love it now
10678,LOVE THIS GAME but the ending sucks.
10679,"i shot a propane tank while my friend was alt+f4 to dupe a wepon , this set him back 3 levels"
10680,"I have owned Borderlands on 360, and now on Steam.
I love this game.  Had to buy it again to play.

Are you at all interested in the art?  The story?  The universe?
$20 is a small price for a great game."
10681,great game! Fun on Coop! Do fun quests or Shoot and loot! good graphics and Claptrap! :-).
10682,"Amazing game if you like open world games.  Designed great, enthralling story, great way to spend $20"
10683,The game is very drab when played as single player. Introverts and social weirdos are gamers too.
10684,"This is a great action-MMORPG kind of game, like an FPS in a slightly sci-fi setting with tons of action and humour.  The different classes, trees, and weapons let you choose your play style and there are tons of sidequests and some DLCs to keep you going.  Don't forget to replay the game with the higher difficulty modes and you should not miss out on the playing the game with fellow players.  You get more enemies to fight, better loot/drops, and it's a part of the experience.  If that's not your style, you can definitely play through the whole game yourself comfortably.

It's a game with a cool story about a sort of hidden treasure that people have come to the planet to seek, and you one of the vault hunters."
10685,"Great for casual single player play. 
It has a great setting with a great array of weaponry. This is not a deep apocalyptic game like Fallout you just go and shoot stuff in the face :D But its great fun. 
The RPG elements are fun to play with and collecting your gear and leveling your skills is very addictive. Finding that bad-♥♥♥ weapon that you always dreamed of is just an awesome feeling.

Co-Op is also very entertaining!
And most importantly it has great replay value......you buy this game you`ll be playing for ages! And you can keep comming back.
10/10"
10686,"ugly and boring. and that was playing with friends. if i was forced to, by law, to play through this game solo then i would kill myself."
10687,Nuts and cool
10688,I really liked the simple graphics and how the story and comedy took over the game. I can't wait till multiplayer is finalized.
10689,if there is one over the top RPG shooter to own it is Borderlands. you wanna run around the desert shooting bandits and skags using big ass guns? then this is the game for you.
10690,"Love this game.  Playing through it with a friend since we're done with BC2.  We decided to play through this one prior to the next BL coming out in a few weeks.  Best part is, they fixed the crippled multiplayer that was lost due to GameSpy's collapse.  THANK YOU developers!"
10691,"HELL YES! GUNS! GUNS! GUNS! MORE BULLETS, MORE BULLETS, ALL THE BULLETS! SHOOT THE BANDITS, EXPLODE THE BANDITS, ELECTRO-PYRO-ACIDIFY THE BANDITS AND MORE!

BUT SERIOUSLY THIS GAME IS SO MUCH SHOOTY, LOOTY, STABBY, BLASTY GOODNESS I CAN'T FIND THE CAPS LOCK AGAIN!"
10692,"Good game, but it is slow in the beginning of the game. It tends to pick up around the middle of it."
10693,"Honestly, I can't see how anyone could say they don't love Borderlands! This game has everything you could want from an RPG and with the new one coming out soon, coming back and playing this one fills me with joy because this game has provided hours of fun for me and my friends and it just never gets old. If you haven't ever played the first Borderlands I recomend you do because I promise you will love it to bits :)"
10694,"I've played most of the game offline, putting over 100+ hours in it.

PROS: 

- Addicitive as all hell
- Literally gun porn
- A gajillion guns
- The characters are straight up awesome
- Incredibly funny
- Tons of content, especially the GOTY edition 

CONS: 
- No active abilities save for the single class-specific action 
- Not enough character customization
- Story isn't that good

VERDICT: If you like guns, humor and shooting bandits in the face, buy this game. Definitely buy it, this game is amazing."
10695,"I've known about this game for a few years but thought it looked crap, boy i was so wrong. I can't put this game down, it's just so addictive. I bought Borderlands 2 GOTY edition first and pre ordered the Prequel and thought hey i'd better play the first one. I bought Borderlands GOTY and never looked back. Just finding the various weapons is fun enough on it's own, and the challenge is, do i keep this one or shall i take that one! It's insane, absolutely love it!

I'm currently Level 31 and the hunger to progress is stopping me from finsishing the DIY. 10/10"
10696,MP for Borderlands has been re-instated through Steam. :) V nice
10697,Fucking love this game
10698,"I wish the co-op worked, but the LAN seems to be fine. Super fun game overall; would definitely recommend!"
10699,"Pure trash. Most boring game I have ever played. I can't begin to comprehend how this game got ""Game of the Year"". I literally had to force my self to finish this game with the idea in mind that so many people enjoyed it. Maybe I just don't get it yet.

The game was rampant with bugs and lazy level design. The story was weak and hardly present, many major events happen while you the player aren't even around, the ending was anti climactic. You start as nothing, do nothing, and end with nothing. Every interesting aspect of this game has literally happened while the player is not present. *Spoilers* from Dahl's mining operations and shut down, to TK's Death. Everything with the remotest amount of interest happens out of sight. The entire game is just one massive fetch quest padded by hundreds of smaller and more tedious fetch quests leading to a boring boss fight at the very end.

I will admit though, up to the final boss, I had maybe an hour of fun thinking this was the climb to a real climax."
10700,The Best action game.
10701,"Blew up a Psycho Migdet with my fists as Brick. 10/10, would punch again."
10702,"One of the few games I can think of that is also exciting the second and third time. Borderlands is a splendid RPG FPS. Blending dark humor with comic book style action is a big ++ for Tell Tale. I would total recommend...assuming you don't probably already own this game.

Why are you even reading this?"
10703,"Borderlands is one fantastic first person shooter. It has a good opening sequence which puts you right into the mind set of the game.

The graphic are very good and runs well even on on low end PC's. However you may need to turn off some of the bells and whistles, but it will still look good. The style of the graphics are a little too cartoony for me but the actual game play and storyline makes up for that.

The game play is very simply but highly addictive. Lucky enough there is plenty to do in the game and in the DLC's to feed your craving.

Sound effect are very good on firing and impact. All the guns you find sound and feel different depending on there stats.

There is a good soundtrack to this game when wondering around Pandora. Whenever you come across a challenging area the soundtrack becomes more dramatic which give you a good indication of what is about to come.

The control are highly responsive on an Xbox controller and feels natural when playing.

I highly recommend this game. The game reminds me a lot of Fallout 3. It is a bit more arcadic and a little less RPG. The world after the apocalypse is also a little brighter than Fallout 3, but the environment in Borderland is a lot more hostile. The game is good fun in both single player and multiplayer co-op. It has a very simple but good storyline to follow. I am looking forward to playing the second game."
10704,I love borderlands since i was a little boy great game reccomend to all
10705,"Love the look and feel of this game.
Also like the fact that you can customize your weapons to not only look but perform better.

The end level was a bit disapointing though."
10706,Great Game
10707,"Borderlands is great. And the graphics still make me stop to notice the way some terrain or structure is drawn in real time. It does have a few quirks, like invisible walls, but the number of variations for combat and exploration make this extremely fun. Questing is a bit unique, and the controlls took a while to adjust to, but now feel fluid and natural. I am playing through the first time as a hunter, and am interested at how different gameplay will be with the other characters."
10708,"The 2nd one has a better story.. But guys, good job :)"
10709,Great game better link http://strawpoll.me/2545390
10710,"What to say.... This game is a an allmost direct copy of RAGE with a hint of Fallout: New Vegas... and not in a good way.
RAGE was a disaster and that makes Borderlands a disaster too.
U get stuck in places you should'nt get stuck, weapons miss too often, (bullets fly directly through enemies without hurting them) and the loot is massive, but mostly bad, missions too boring or too long and enemies that spawn too fast or too often... and suddenly, the game is over... just like RAGE.

All in all, waste of your money (and mine as well :P)"
10711,"I have finished this game a combined 13 times on various platforms. I even bought it on steam  years ago just so I could have it on my profile (way before you could just download the steam activation thing) I love this game and ever (pre) Sequel.
Aint No rest for the Wicked! 10/9
"
10712,"tl;dr It's good but a terrible single player game, unless your into that kinda stuff like me~ 8/10
Edit: The Multiplayer is now supported through steam so if you wanna play it with friends, do it! 

I've beaten the main story so I feel like it's time to post a review. I enjoyed this game a lot more than I thought I would. A friend recommmended this game to me. At first, I wasn't sure, but I decided to buy the GOTY edition during the summer sales. I've always loved RPG games. This game has a lot of aspects I like in a RPG game but with guns. Granted, I'm not a huge fan of FPS games but that wasn't a factor with my opinion of the game. It doesn't take itself seriously and I love it. When I finished building my PC, this was the first game I played on it. It will be special to me in that way as well though I hope that doesn't make my opinion bais. 
I recommend this game a lot. The only things that would make me say otherwise are if you enjoy single player games only, you don't like having constant side missions, and/or if you want to play with your friends RIGHT NOW. I played through this game all on my own because that's how I like to play, but with this game, that's harder to do mostly because it gets boring easily. The multiplayer is down temporarily due to the mulitplayer being intergrated with gamespy's site. Since gamespy closed down, playing multiplayer has been almost impossible. I say almost because there is a LAN option, but for most people I know at least, they would only be able to play through the multiplayer. Steam is in the process of changing this so the multiplayer is through their servers like Borderlands 2 but I have no idea when this will be finished. 
If those reasons don't effect you, get the game. If you want to play multiplayer on the first Borderlands, you'll be able to at some point so I wouldn't say that's a huge deal breaker, with me at least."
10713,"Got 500Xp for blowing my car up 10/10

i strongly recomend it 10/10"

10716,All i have to say is to play and get a shit ton of loot!
10717,Good Game
10718,Great Blend of RPG and FPS! Weapons are insanely awesome!
10719,The best game of this generation. Hands down. Strips the flesh and salts the wounds of all other games in any genre! This is my seventh time beating it on my thrid platform.
10720,"This game is not fun singleplayer. Who the crap uses GameSpy anymore? I thought that died with the 90s. I wanted to like this game, but having no one to play with, it just felt like I was playing in a huge world all alone. Go here, kill X things. Retrieve this. Run here, run there. Boring."

10724,"Is there anyone who actually doesn't like this game?

This game plays like a 80's action movie. Huge guns and lots of frags. The plot isn't too thin, and the characters are ridiculous but likeable. 

It has lots of replay value."

10726,"Update: Ive replayed the game twice and had a blast again as it brought back a lot of happy memory, i found the begining boring because i had played the start with my best friend around 6 or seven years ago and playing that part alone afterwards without him after he moved away effected how i felt about it, nevertheless this game is amazing and would recomend."
10727,It's a fucking good game!!!
10728,"Awesome, will still play 10 years from now!"
10729,"Game freezes and gives BSOD.   Reinstalled drivers, checked ram, chenge amount of cores used, nothing works.  Good thing I bought on sale."
10730,"I have given multiple tries for Borderlands and I finally managed to complete the game on the 4th go.

Why?

Because if you are playing solo, it can be boring as hell, I found the DLC content to be much more enjoyable.

The atmosphere, the whole desert, forgotten world of Pandora, with all the unique landmarks is really something to behold, and some of the characters are memorable. Story aside it's a standard shooter with loot mechanics much like Diablo, nothing extraordinary.

Most of the time I play the sniper which is over lvl 45 now and the only thing that keeps me playing is to level up to fight Crawmerax, but getting there with 2nd playthrough is extremely stale. Some of the action skills are good, but not overall helpful.

Multiplayer is currently broken, I have read that playing in co-op makes all the difference, so I am still willing to give this one a shot later. The Underdome DLC is almost impossible to do solo, so they better fix it.

10736,"If you like realism, historical accuracy, seriousness or liniar gameplay you are so in the wrong place.

Its cartoonish, comdic, crude (and rude), sci-fi, random, role playing, co op, shooting, violent, brutish awesomeness. For a 5 year old game it made me laugh all the way through. BUY this piece of what will be gaming history for it's ingenous, and play with your friend(s) for a hilarious experience.

9/10

Not a 10 because the sequel(s) might top this."
10737,"Guys, this is the solution for the stuttering of the game. Go to the config file (WillowEngine.ini). Search for ""bSmoothFrameRate"" by press and hold Control + F, and search for it. Change ""bSmoothFrameRate=True"" to ""bSmoothFrameRate=False"" and search for ""UseVsync"". Change ""UseVsync=False"" to ""UseVsync=True"". It will solve the lag/stuttering issue. :)"
10738,"Borderlands was a very fun game that I have now completed three times. I really like looters, and this game did a great job with tons of interesting guns to use. The story is interesting but is missing something to make you care more. The side quests are mostly just tons of fetch quests that get boring quick. Occasionally there will be one fun side quest that is quite memorable, but most are just rehashed version of go there, kill this, come back.
     My biggest complaint is with enemy variety. After the first 15 minutes of playing, you will see the things you will be fighting for the rest of the game. The bandits and rakks just level scale and become more challenging. If you can get past this problem and the dull ""fetch"" quests, this game is really fun. For an FPS, this game moves fluent and leveling is great. Multi-player is where this game shines. Those dull fetch quests and same mobs don't bother you near as much when you are playing with a friend. The boss fights are also fun, but nothing too special. You will also find the characters you meet are not very memorable. Finally money is near useless. You will get money everywhere but never really need it.
     My first run through, I had no complaints. The game is often fun, but never really so compelling that you can't turn away. You will even get a few laughs out of it. I myself really liked The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned. Generally by the end of Borderlands, I had fun, but I had no urge to keep going. Here is my take away in a pro con chart.

Pros

Lots of guns with lots of effects
Tons of looting, making it worth checking around for hidden chests
Multi-player is really fun
Story line is fairly interesting
Fluid game play
Lots of little goals to accomplish (such as 1,000 SMG kills, ect.)
Good for some laughs

Cons

Very boring side quests
Almost no mob variety 
Very little voiced lines, meaning you will be reading a shit ton.
Money is almost completly useless 


All in all, this game is worth your time to play it. So if you are wondering where in the series to start, I would recommend here if you got a friend or two to run it through with. I'd give the game an 8/10."
10739,AWESOME
10740,"If there's one thing people like, it's a good RPG. But, I don't mean the likes of RPG's that take themselves way to seriously. No, I mean the ones that have enemies that are the funniest I've ever seen, or maybe the one's that don't care about strategy, or the best human-like graphics, or even a story that makes the game that much better. This one is run and blow your enemies head off. It's just a little game I like to call Borderlands."
10741,"-Large, sandy desert

10746,Absolutely loved this game.  I wish i had have played it sooner than i did - 8/10
10747,"After playing through and compeleting Borderlands two over one year ago, I finally picked up the original Borderlands. Even without playing the fist one, Borderlands 2 is my favorite game of all time. Borderlands 1 does not reach those heights, however, it is still brilliant in its own right. 
BL1 is, in simplest terms, a smaller version of BL2. And that was just fine by me. I really loved this game, and I can defeintly say now that the Borderlands series is my favortie franchise and I can not wait for the prequel!

Final rating: 9/10"
10748,"Probably the most batshit insane game I've played in a while. Never before has shooting midgets and lave crab-worms ever been more fun, and there's more loot than a Malaysian Airlines crash site. 10/10"
10749,"I played BL2 1st and I have to say getting to know these Vault Hunters in the 2nd game makes loving them way too easy. The game is fun by itself and I would recommend playing BL2 then BL1. If I would have started with 1 I would not have loved the series as much since BL1 seems to lack humor. =/ As of this review I got past the 1st actual area and I am having fun. =) For the most part BL1 plays more like an RPG WAY MORE then BL2. Go into an area you are not meant to go yet and the eneimes are a higher level. If you do go to a story mission and are underleveled just go do a few missions and you will be up to par. ^_^

ALL IN ALL:
A Great game! =D"
10750,"It's Borderlands.   You got guns and stuff.  There was this Robot, and...."
10751,"It's a coop game, but you can just play through this in singleplayer and it's still fun. The weapon variety is great and different enemy types have different combat styles and weak points. The skills are fun and provide a reason to grind to max level, or start a new character for a new playthrough.

It also has different skills and environments from the sequel, so it's still worth going back to if you've only played Borderlands 2.

I'd also recommend all the DLCs (except Moxxi's Underdome Riot). The Dr. Ned DLC is probably the best.

Would recommend to a friend.

Final Verdict : 8.5/10 - Not too optimized for amd."
10759,shit game 9/10- ign
10760,"I have played this before and it was an alright game. But the FOV will give you a headache within 10 minutes. There are fixes for this, although you will have to press a hot key after everytime you sprint, melee or get in a car. Save your money and buy another game."
10761,This game is like a relative that won't fucking leave you alone until you have to uninstall them and format their SSDs.
10762,Love this game. Billions of guns....I am in 10/10
10763,"Recently purchased Borderlands and have no regretted it at all. Gameplay is solid, story is great though can be hard to keep up with if you constantly do side missions like myself. Only problem is that multiplayer is currently dead as the Gamespy servers were shut down only a few months ago. We are promised an update, but that has yet to be seen any time in the near future. Could be great to play with other people, but have to go through various methods to connect to one another. If the game is on sale, its def a must buy. But without proper servers to run Multiplayer, it’s not really worth full price that you would really pay for a fully functioning game."
10764,"I thoroughly enjoy playing this game. The art style is awesome, and it's not too graphically intensive, meaning that rvrn if you don't have an incredible gaming rig, it will still work. Absolutely would reccomend it, and definitely worth the price."
10765,"This is one of those games that you grab your friends, a bowl of chips, and a compfy sofa to play on.  I can admit that the weapons are unbalanced, the shields/grenades are unbalanced, and hell, even the classes are unbalanced, but the game, with friends, is hilariously fun.

Very creative take with the blend of RPG and FPS genres, all while managing to make grinding not difficult.  Guns, of course, take the game's central focus, with a startling amount of combinations.  That feeling when you find 50 bucks on the sidewalk?  That's how you feel when you find rare loot in Borderlands."
10766,Always cool to blow things up
10767,"This is the game fallout wishes it could be. 10/10 so replayable and memorable

10768,"Pretty good game, and some many freakin' guns!"
10769,Yeah!
10770,[i]Like Skyrim With Guns 10/10 -IGN [/i]
10771,"An FPS with a humorous setting in an alien world, focused on loot – kill enemies, find better gear, kill more enemies, find better gear. My review is from a solo play, so I can't attest to how the game feels if you play it in its co-op form.

This game is a few dozen-hour worth of grind. If it had a compelling story, the experience may have been different. Sadly, the plot is the most basic thing you can expect. You are a treasure hunter in a strange land, and your quest leads you closer and closer to something called ""The Vault"", a place accessible only once every 200 years. Don't expect any Indiana Jones investigation and mystery solving, though. You basically just drag through the different missions. Which all amount to the same thing.

That's something that bothered me. The missions. This game is a practice at FedEx delivery. Each level is its own open map with a few transition points to ""dungeons"", so to speak. You can fast travel between the hubs, and you'll often need to. The DLCs are more colorful, as are the late stages of the game, but for the most part of it the landscape doesn't much change from the bleak desert view. At each stage you'll have some main NPC handing out the central mission, as well as a ""Bounty Board"" of sorts where you can pick up side quests. 

Problem is, all the side quests are summarized by going to this point and either killing this slightly stronger version of the same monster you already fought, or gather pointless items that are in no way interesting (I need 10 monster brains, I need 4 pieces of a shotgun, etc). What's more, it often happens that a bounty board won't display all the missions for the area from the start. Meaning that somewhere during your play you'll receive a message that there are new missions available, and you'll find yourself backtracking again to the same areas, to collect more uninteresting items or kill more bosses with mega HP. Items that did not appear, or alternatively you could not pick up, before you ""accepted"" the mission itself. This is is just a formula for a lot of wasted time, just to make the game longer.

It's not all bad. The setting is cool, graphics are unique, the humor brought out a few laughs (particularly in the DLCs, which are much better than the standard missions of the game), and there /is/ something satisfying about finding better weapons. As I began by saying – loot is the focus of the game. You'll find countless versions of the weapons, and at times it'll be recommended to switch between different options of your shotgun\rifle\SMG\else, depending on the enemy. They have cetain elemental bonuses – fire, acid, electricity... – and some enemies are immune to this damage, or that, making you need to adapt on the fly. It's as simple as opening the inventory screen and switching the gear.

Combat itself is pretty fun, honestly, and the enemies are colorful and varied. You pick between four different classes when the game starts, and level up. The skills-tree is pretty simple, with just one active ability for each class and then different passive boosts to this one ability – e.g. one class summons a raven, another turns invisible and super-fast – but it is still enjoyable to develop.

Difficulty depends on how much of a completionist you are. There is no difficulty scale – instead each quest comes with a recommended level to complete. If you accept a quest for a level 28 when you're 31, it'll be trivial, probably. If you insist on doing every side-quest (like I did for most of the game until the DLCs which I played at the end, since they take place after the main 'story'), it won't take long for you to fly high above the levels of your enemies. By the middle of the game I had more money than I knew what to do with, and was enough higher level than my foes to just rush in, guns blazing, and shoot them in the head at point blank without much worry.

In conclusion – fun battle mechanics with an addictive loot system, but the /extremely/ repetitive and FedEx styled sidequests, along with an utterly generic story, made me force myself to finish this game after just a few hours into it. It may have been different if it were a short game. Or if you could toy with the difficulty. But it isn't. And you can't. If you're the sort who just enjoys a simple shooter without additional substance to it (which is fine!), you may enjoy Borderlands. If you, like me, can't get into a game without it having even a minimally decent story and characters, I suggest you skip this Borderlands.

That being side, it might be something completely different if you're after an online experience. Haven't tried that, not much of an online player, so better search for a different review.

The reason I have 40-some hours sunk into it is because I felt obligated to finish the main quest, side quests and the DLCs before writing a review."
10772,Cam would have this game but he bought a bunch of gays skins for bl2 and was 20 cents off of goty edition :tf:
10773,"What can I say about this game that hasn't been said before, and much better? Unique, entertaining, fun, this is gaming fun at its best for me."
10774,"I have a crappy computer. Borderlands runs buttery smooth on it.

I got Borderlands because it begins the shoot-and-loot legacy leading to its amazing sequels. But we're talking about number one here. 

I've met plenty of people who say, ""ew look a creppy guy shoting himslef in teh hedd tis suxx"", but Borderlands is one of the most excellent games I have ever seen. Stylistic comic book-like graphics mixed with a seemingly infinite number of guns makes Borderlands a truly great shooter. 

9/10"
10775,"This is where the cars live, get you one!"
10776,"Borderlands is a fantastic RPG/FPS game. I have been playing it every minute of my free time. Prior to ever playing the game or ever giving it a chance, I thought that the game looked stupid. However, I was very happily proven wrong when I decided I would give the game a shot. Now, almost 15 hours into the game and no where near being done with it, I can say that this game is definitely worth what you pay for. It is a beautiful game with great graphics and mechanics. What more could you ask for in an RPG?"
10777,"With out a doubt, this is one of the best RPG FPS games I have ever played. I have no complaints about this game, because every part of it is amazing. BUY IT NOW!"

10783,"Before you scroll back up and buy it.

It's a one trick pony.

It gets very repetitive and boring. 
////I COULDNT PLAY COOP///
Single Player doesn't bring any fun. It's a grind, but a good kind.

If you want to shoot and then shoot and not think about why or what you're shooting, it's great (thus thumbs up)
If you want a little more from a game than shooting, it's a nono.

10784,"This game is just brialliant! If you have ever played a game like World of Warcraft this is the FPS style of that genre , It combines killing a load of bad guys and some really well designed bad guys with more guns to collect then you can ever imagine.

I have played this game on the Xbox360 , PS3 , and now playing it on PC and i must say i do seem to be enjoying it alot more on PC with it being a FPS."
10785,fuck you

It's clearly a 9/10 or even a 10/10"
10790,"Borderlands is one of the best game ever I recomend buying BUT borderlands 2 is way bigger, more fun, and more exiting, and better...... borderlands pre-sequel coming soon too"
10791,"I'm more of a ""level up"" your character type of gamer. I've never really been into first person shooters and this game gave me a new perspective on mixing level ups and first person action. The storymode is very cool and there is a huge selection of different types of weapons, giving you the ability to create a unique character where your skill points can completement your aresenal. The story mode was very entertaining and the boss fights can be very fun and challenging at the same time.

I highly recommend this game!"
10792,"This game is just insane and borderlands 2 is twice... 
My advice, get the one and its addons, nailed it and enjoy borderlands 2 right after!
"
10793,"awesome game, just like borderlands 2 is awesome"
10794,So fuking awesome :)) very very good :))
10795,Love this game. Nice fps and a lot of varied loot.
10796,GOOD GAME
10797,Classic...
10798,"I'll be honest, when I first heard about this game I thought it looked... flimsy. After playing a bit of it here on Steam and far far more on my PS3, I can say the experience is not only solid, it is worth playing again and again with different characters and different partners. This game really excels at co-op, and I love me some co-op. The skill trees are varied enough to give each player a personalized feel for their character progression and the weapons come in so many shapes and sizes, there is no way to get into them all (except of course... the burning... ""oh god! why am I on fire!?""). Hilarious voice acting, I specifically loved the random stuff enemies would say (you never should've come here, now you're gonna pay!) I could go on with that bit... Suffice it to say, Borderlands marries FPS and RPG with style."
10799,10/10 would play with friends
10800,This game is great I think its better than the second one any way if you dont have it your missing out on a TON of fun.

10811,"Where do I start? I guess I'll just give you the short version and say that this game is the game that I put the most hours in when I played on console. Not only was it fun for myself, but for the friend that I played through it with. Borderlands is one of the single best single player/co-op RPG Shooter games I have ever played; it offers the RPG element with weapons/equipment stats, as well as skills and skill points. Long story short, interesting and challenging enemies, great character development, and a shit ton of loot.

10815,"I'm a level 65 and love borderlands, firstly for those who complain about FOV, you NEED to change the resolution higher, SO much better, I love the whole wasteland kinda thing and when I use my revolvers I feel like a cowboy, there are an unmeasurable amount of weapons and I recently got a Jakobs pearlescent sniper in a lance chest in knoxx's armoury, my favourite make and weapon, and to top it off, it is the ultimate sniper, when zoomed it has 100% accuracy, so only human error can screw it up, this game was a surprise to the creators since they didn't think it would be so popular, but it was, there is in-depth backstory, good maps and sure it can get a bit repetative, but when you finish a game there isn't gonna be a whole fudging new story, that is what DLC is for, sure borderlands 2 will be better, it's newer so it will be updated, that is just how it works, but I love this game, especially my favourite DLC, Jakob's cove, though of course I used the armoury a lot :P basically free money and good weapons, but the whole zombies thing I loved however after looking at global achievements, 13.6% of people kill Ned, yet 13.9% of people kill undead Ned. LOGIC! Since Undead Ned can only be fought if you kill normal Ned, but my favourite part is the halloween kinda thing, I love horror so it was fantastic."
10816,"Borderlands is one of the funniest games I've played with friends! Hours and hours of fun! A game that proclaims a million jillion guns, you will never be disappointed with the loot!"
10817,"Having played the hell out of the retail edition before activating on Steam, I'd like to think I played enough to give at least a decent idea of what you may be getting into playing this game.

-Loot.  Tons and tons of loot.  If you enjoyed the loot-gathering aspect of games like Diablo, you're gonna love Borderlands.
-Challenge.  This game is decently challenging without being the type of game that would make you want to repeatedly hit your head against the nearest brick wall.  Some of the bosses can be a pain in the rear, but there's a definite sense of accomplishment when you beat them.
-Graphics.  The cel-shading in the game is beautiful, and works well with the game's not-even-remotely serious tone.
-Length.  Even the base game on its own is a good length, what with all the sidequests that are available to do (and you'll likely be doing them for all that extra loot :P).  Add in the 4 DLC's and... well, damn.
-Loot.  Did I mention the loot?

In short, good length, good challenge, good graphics, good loot = good game.  Get the GOTY edition.  You won't be sorry."
10818,yea it good
10819,No insta kill penis shot 3/1
10820,Not really worth the $6 i bought it for today.. i got it wanting to complete it before the prequel came out.. its just way too pixelated to enjoy it..and the ONLY options for video is BRIGHTNESS.. really lame..
10821,I have been in love with this game and it's unique humor and art styles since the day it came  out. I would strongly reccomend this game to everyone. The new multiplayer system is a vast improvement over gamespy and is just as if not more fun than single player.

10825,Awesome game lots of fun with friends
10826,"This game is just F***ing amazing! I played Borderlands 2 first, and at this time it is my most played game, thanks to all the DLC and me being a noob. When I started this game, due to me pre-ordering The Pre-Sequel and getting me in the Borderlands mood again, Borderlands 2 is my most played game. 100 hours isnt a lot for many people, but I struggle to replay games, making it hard for me to get thousands of hours in a game. I also struggle to do side quests after finishing the main story due to my feeling that there is no point. Borderlands 2 I loved the story, but after completing the game, apart from DLC, I felt this, making it a struggle to play the game for long periods without gettingbored. THis was the one thing I disliked about Borderlands 2, but I guess it is just me. 
I didnt get this feeling with Borderlands. The game didn't feel as repetetive and Borderlands 2 got, and it felt like a lot nier experience to play. Yes the story wasn't quite as good, but the gameplay just felt better. The lack of a golden box meant finding weapons actually felt rewarding and exciting, and completing sidequests to get the loot made it feel more interesting and caused me to fel more drawn in, meaning after I completeted the main questline I still had a couple hours fun before finishing all missions. I wont be able to play through again, as I can't do that, maybe in a few years when games all become pay-2-win and I feel like going back to the old days.
This game, of which I thought couldn't possibly be better than Borderlands 2, proved me wrong. If you enjoyed Borderlands 2, get this game. It is 10x more fun, if that is possible, and I sure hope the future Borderlands games are just as good.

Tl;dr even better than Borderlands 2, buy this aswell!"
10827,"Absolutely brilliant game, it's the bastion of cell shaded FPS games!"
10828,"Not as fun as people say it is... Skip this one and play borderlands 2 instead. Not funny enough to play for the jokes, not good enough to play for the gameplay and not good looking/good sounding enough to play for the atmosphere. I had some fun playing with 2 friends or more, but I also enjoy hanging out with them regardless, and that costs me 0$. If you want to play it, I would only recommend doing so with 2 or 3 GOOD friends (not random people from your friends list).

10829,10/10
10830,good game
10831,"The first title in the sci-fi series brings a cooperative first-person shooting experience combined with player customization and vehicular combat. An excellent game alltoghether, an absolute blast and a must have for fans of both the RPG and FPS genres."
10832,Amazingly fun game even on your own! Great Price too. Go Forth and Get Da Coin
10833,I'm coming for you Pitchford... and Hell's coming with me
10834,This game makes me actually laugh out loud with its over-the-top dialogue and excelent character designs. Some people critisize the story for being cliche. Those people are jack-asses.
10835,"This is among the few games that I can go back to play again and again, across console and PC both.  It's enjoyable, plain and simple."
10836,"Borderlands is one of my all time favorite games, I've played through it more than 15 times over the past 5 years, basically get it, especially if it's on sale.  There is no reason to not get it."
10837,"This game is amazing it is a must for rpg and shooter fans and here is why.
1) Greatly implemented RPG elements
2) An amazing time with friends
3) Now has Steam matchmaking 
4) It's only £5 for all dlc included, which are 4 in total 
5) Lots of quests and new things to explore
This gets an 9/10 for me as it's a gem that all RPG owners should pick up and play."
10838,"You should buy this game. Now. Like right here right now. Why are you still reading this? You're supposed to be buying this now. Wow. You're still reading this, just go buy it."
10839,Nice change of pace. Some cool moments. Great for a couple bux.
10840,"I was skeptical when a friend recommended it because I wasn't in to the cartoon style graphcis, but after purchasing the first Borderlands game just a month or two before this one was released, I was truly excited to have yet another Borderlands game in the series. And at the time I'm writing this review, you bet I'm pumped for Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. Would I recommend? Absolutely. If you're into sci-fi, shooters, treasure/loots, guns, and/or a ton of fun, this is the game for you. I would also recommend either the GOTY edition, or purchasing the DLC's. They're a great addition to the Borderlands: 2 story, and they're well worthy it."
10841,The most fun you can have with your pants on. Or off.
10842,"Just as good as the second one.
wait..."
10843,Fantastic game
10844,"So much to sink your teeth into, with a main story that isn't short but not too long either! It's weirdly good natured fun where peoples' heads explode all the time? Like, constantly? Also it's got a comic-book aesthetic.

It's important to state that this game is more fun with friends. But I've still played it plenty on my own."
10845,"Kicked off one of the greatest video game franchises of all time, how can you hate it? Imo also has some of my favorite DLC's in the series."
10846,"- Nice graphics;
- Good storyline;
- High replayability;
- One of the best to play Co-op with your friends;

Get the GOTY version, cause the 4 DLC's are well worth it."
10847,"If you aren't already hip to this game being awsome, you must have been living under a rock. Awesome game!"
10848,"Boring gunplay,boring guns,boring quests,boring characters,boring skill tree(all stuff is passive),crappy story. This game is an all round piece of shit"
10849,The best game I'd ever played when it initially released - spend your money here then go buy the rest...
10850,"This game is one of the most fun I had in quite some time.
Plus, it makes my skin crawl :)
A must have."
10851,one of the best games i have ever played. very fond memories and nice to relive them
10852,Yes! ... That is all.
10853,"Borderlands kan bedst beskrives som en blanding af Mad Max, Quake og Diablo. Selve gameplayet er egentlig temmelig hjernedødt, men også vandvittigt underholdende. Det er en loot-fest, hvor en stor del af fornøjelsen består i at opstøve de fedeste våben og bruge dem på spillets monstre. Spillets verden har et tegneserieagtigt look, og der er masser af humor. Specielt de hjælpsomme Clap-Trap-robotter er vandvittigt morsomme. Alt i alt et spil, som man kan få oceaner af tid til at gå med."
10854,Better than number 2
10855,I can never get enough of this game and the farther I play the better it keeps getting.
10856,Only few words to this game Best looter shooter i have ever played!
10857,"To be fair people like this game. There's LOTS of needless backtracking and the characters singular abilites are all lame. I semi enjoyed it for a while; really liked the music but all in all average to dull at best.

3/5"
10858,"If you are looking for a game JUST for partially good gameplay, than this is your game!

However, if you are looking for a game that has a great storyline, super hard enemies(Last boss was the only really hard boss), and doesn't take a god awful long time to beat, than this is NOT your game. It took me 34 hours to beat, and I'm not going to spoil anything, but the ending of the game REALLY sucks. I don't mean that the ending was sad or anything, it just SUCKS. It gets pretty fun getting closer to the end, but it's a relatively long and slow game, and most of the fun is just in the shooting. There aren't any cool parts where you fly space ships or anything like that, all you're able to do is use your guns and drive around in an underpowered car to fight people. The enemies remain relatively the same for most of the game, it's mostly just their levels that change. The story line is shallow, and leaves almost everything unanswered by the end of the game. While the game was fun and I'm glad I beat it, it truly wasn't worth the 34 hours it took me to beat."
10859,"Que se yo, esta bueno el juego, muy bueno. lo recomiendo 9/10 a favoritos."
10860,One of the best games on the world
10861,Fantastic game. Definitely should be played with friends. 10/10
10862,"Even though this isn't borderlands 2, the magnificent. It still is a great a game and I really think if people gave it a shot they would like it. But not as much as BL2. Borderlands 1 had some pretty nice and well designed DLC the combat system and loot system is a little harder to understand than in BL2. I know I am comparing everything to BL2 and you know it has its ups and downs in this game. It is hard but both of them are. The quests should be in order just like in BL2. This game will run very well on bad computers, (My computer xD) but they both run fine and I can play them and thats all that matters! :D"
10863,"This is the best game ever! I have played it on xbox 360 and ps3 over 5 times each, and still enjoy playing it. The loot system is incredible! If you do not have this game, BUY GOTY NOW!"
10864,great game. fun to play.
10865,Love boarderlands. Many differences from ps3. To bad about the multi player not being available. they better hurry up and get it working. Never pre order a game from this dev.
10866,"I love this game and i was almost finished the whole thing until my little brother deleted my save game, oh well its time to start all over again im okay with that."
10867,"One of the best, in your face games i have ever played. Loads of fun, attitude and personality. Go for it!"
10868,"Borderlands, the ultimate loot and shoot fest.

While this game does not boast the most engaging narrative or memorable characters, it does somewhat succeed to entertain on the gameplay front. In an open world with an abundance of baddies out to kill you, there is virtually no end to the amount of mindless shooting that can be done. While that can quickly become repetitive, and perhaps even dull in the minds of some, others will never tire. As for myself, I had mixed feelings, which I will attempt to describe at some length without boring you as much as this game occasionally could.

I couldn't help but notice that one of the labels this game has garnered on Steam is ""RPG"". Hmm, to the slightest extent, I may agree, but hesitantly. Yes, you can pick from a number of different classes that each possess different skills. Aside from that however, there is very little customization. You can select a variety of colors for your character's appearance, but that's hardly relevant. There is no decision making in this game. You will not have the opportunity to respond to any NPC you may speak to, their primary purpose is to provide you with quests so you can shoot more things. But while we're on the topic of shooting things, I musn't forget that there are several ways to do so. I have no idea how many weapons are in this game, but I can assure you that there is enough to the point where you will not find them all. And that is something that I rather enjoyed, as you will never find yourself spending a monotonous length of time with the same gun. Superior weapons will be popping up left and right, and all of them will aid you in shooting things with more efficiency. 

Now that we've thoroughly discussed shooting things, I believe it's time that we covered the other main activity in this game: looting things. For the sake of keeping things simple and concise, allow me to inform you now that everything you shoot, you can loot. You will also find an assortment of boxes, crates, garbage piles, and, I kid you not, toilets that can be looted. What sort of loot will you procure, you ask? Weapons, money, and ammunition. Weapons so you can shoot things in a slightly different fashion, money so you can buy more weapons to shoot things with, and ammunition so you can never stop shooting things. If it hasn't become apparent already, everything you do in this game serves so that you may never stop shooting things, and if you discontinue shooting things, it means you're not playing this game, because as long as you're playing Borderlands, you will always be shooting something.

So there you have it. Of course there are many other aspects of this game that I failed to divulge, however I feel that I did my duty and informed you of the two most important components. What does that mean? It means that if you are an avid fan of looting and shooting things, then this is the title you've been waiting to get your hands on. If not, you may want to avoid Borderlands.

7/10 for Borderlands, your impressions of this game will be entirely dependent on your preferences, I simply don't view this as the sort of game that is either bad or good."
10869,"Meh.

Borderlands reminds me of Fallout 3, kinda. Borderlands takes place on some alien planmet and you find a vault and there's guns and crazy people and yeah that's about it. It does have the tons of guns they boast about, but there's no reason to carry more than like 3 or 4 since there's no reason to carry 2 of any gun class. The character creation is pretty interesting and makes quests worth doing, so it isn't boring, per se. The graphics are nothing special, even with everything maxed and modding the game to use AA (Yeah the game doesn't support Anti-aliasing out of the box for some reason), but the Field of View feels like it's zoomed in and modding it messes with the viewmodels on the guns, so the game can be disorienting. The characters are either annoying or uninteresting, but there are occasional characters that are alright. It has plenty of good things but also plenty of not very good things. It's worth at least a few minutes of playtime, at any rate. Find a friend who has this game and play it together or even just play it by yourself for a little. It's not bad, but it's a game that you'd need to try to figure out whether it's good or not. Watching and playing this game are two different experiences."
10870,best game ever and it runs well on my pc
10871,"Awesome game, and alot of fun to play with up to 3 friends once the Steam Network Update is live. 
Some of the most remarkable features are:
[list]
    [*]Awesome DLC's with the GOTY Edition
    [*]Rewarding Loot which scales with each level
    [*]Refreshing graphic style 
    [*]Its very own humour
[/list]
"
10872,"""Its Medicinal"" 10/10"
10873,"Cartoony graphics with a decent story.
Multiplayer now shut down :(

Other than that GREAT"
10874,"Dawm you borderlands! This game is so much fun, that it's easy to forget the time. 

Pros:
- Fun and silly comments of the characters + well chosen voice actors (both playable and NPC's)
- over 2 billion weapons to choose from
- good looking cartoonish graphics
- and so many more that it's hard to even think of things to say

Cons:
- sooo much walking (until you get a car)
- not enough inventory space to cary all the stuff you find (in order to cell it all and make a ton of cash)
- road-kills are too over powered (*Drives around like a mad man, killing everything in his path*)

All and all it's a great game and I can't wait to start playing the second one. (But have to finnish the first one before I do that)
"
10875,Feels like the good old Blizzard North(before selling out to Actv) hilarious gameplay in fps form.
10876,"This is a good game, buy this because it's worth a good blast and has replayability with the expansion packs and stuff an junk blah blah blah 400 hrs blah blah blah, just buy the dam game!!!!!"
10877,idk
10878,"cool RPG, cool storyline, good graphics and won't get bored easily xD :)"
10879,It's a good game
10880,"Extremely fun game, both co-op and solo. Recommend Buying the DLCs too. Inteligent dialogue and funny comments. I loved it so much i completed it 100% (got every single achievement in the game)."
10881,"grate game runs brill but one thing on windows 8,1 it has randome crashes when in the vendors its realy anoying plz could you fix this"
10882,"This is one of my all time favourite games.  Sure, it doesn't have much of a story, but the action and humour more than make up for it.  All of the DLC makes it even better.  The game is absolutely packed full of content.  If you're at all into shooters, you must absolutely give this game a try."
10883,awsome game
10884,Excellent game. Brought me back to fps genre.
10885,Play with friends :)
10886,A Fantastic First Person Shooter with a twist of RPG element. A Start tp a great franchsie. A must play for every First Person Shooter fan.
10887,"It's basically what happens when Mad Max's son makes a video game where you shoot a bunch of Jason Voorhees' in the face...

...multiple times."
10888,"This game is the best game. The only Bestier game is the next game and the only even bestier one than that will probably be the pre sequel with is third but second in order only with newer stuff, so best, bester or bestier still, england be damned, PLAY ALL BORDERLANDS or find yourself in a desert without Loot Chests."
10889,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING i highly recommend it but one thing the graphics arent the best but thats what makes the game fun. Borderlands 2 on the other hand is one of the worst games i have every put money into and ever played. Borderlands 2 the leveling up system is too easy i played 15 minutes i was already level 30 beat half the bosses Borderlands on the other hand it was some challenge, Borderlands 2 wasnt that hard so i recommend playing borderlands and not the second one. I mean the game will never be the same like each time you play you will get different guns (not mission guns they stay the same) but i mean its an amzing game I RECOMMEND IT!!!"
10890,Best Co-op FPS for those who doesn't mind bullet sponge enemies and who loves collecting stuffs
10891,"This is a very good game 
Never know whats comming up next
The Robot is so very cutie
"
10892,"Oh yeah, Amazing"
10893,"Fun, quirky, cartoony art style with cell shading. The game and storyline are pretty good. Multiplayer isn't very enjoyable unless you're just doing co-op and no battling."
10894,"Borderlands (moar like Boredomlands, AMIRITE?) is a ground-breaking game concept - take Fallout 3, make the combat more like Halo, add a randomizing technology à la Diablo II, steal characters from Killzone, throw in the meatheads from Gears of War, then give it a Mad Max skin,place the game on planet Pandora (100% original name) , use cell shading to cover up poor graphics, and finally, suck out any innovation. Clearly, this is the most original game evar. The only reason anyone bought this game is because they thought it was an expansion to the original game, Fallout 3. What they got was LOTSA FUCKIN' PURDY GUNZ!!!"
10895,Sooooo much better than the sequal. The classes might be a little bit less interesting but the gameplay is unbelievably more fun. 11/10.
10896,Yay Man Love This Game i'v Had it since it came out and i will Never Stop play brah way to much fun
10897,"Wow, what the best game ever i play with CS graphic"
10898,"What can I say about Borderlands that hasn't already been said?  There isn't much I can add to the existing reviews, let's plays and the fact you probably already have this game.  But if you don't, I can say this game will appeal to the non FPS gamer of which I'm one.  The hunt for loot and a better gun is addicting.  The DLC add ons which you should just get as part of a cheap Game of the Year package will give you even more hours of play.  I put the majority of my hours into the 360 version and the PC version looks even better.  I only wish I had the time for another play through as well as getting though Borderlands 2 with its mountain of content."
10899,"I wanted to try out Borderlands 1 before going onto 2 and have very much enjoyed the journey so far.  I find that I am really interested to find out about the weird blue lady, and as annoying as claptrap is I like him.  I think the characters are superb, simple, yet very deep.

The game play is easy to learn, and as soon you think you have the best gun ever and things die fast, the game cranks up the challenge and it remains fun.

I recommend this game for all FPS fans, and a possibility for those action RPG type"
10900,"Good game, gets a bit repetitive.  The art style is refreshing.  I know my review is like 10 years late."
10901,"holy shit, yes.
"
10902,"shot some mad max cosplaying nerds to death with a cool fire pistol.

7/10. sure."
10903,"It's several years old, but it's still great fun.  The voice acting is great, the graphics are stylized but not cartoony, you'll spend a good amount of time chasing down achievments and such.  It's great fun in co-op, good and bloody and challenging too.  This is one of the best co-op FPS games I've ever played, and have recommended it to people on Steam and elsewhere"
10904,this games awesome and i love it
10905,"Enjoy this game befor it turned into Memelands 2, 
The Coop is really satifying and the humor is great. 

The only thing that bothers me is that the game is 4 years old and didn't got much cheaper"
10906,It's a pretty Cool Game! :D
10907,"Fun alone ,epic with friends!"
10908,This Fallout: New Vegas loot mod really takes the game to space. It adds a whole level of depth to the loot available in Fallout: New Vegas. I'd recommend this to anyone getting bored of picking up lockpicks and forks.
10909,"Five years later I Finally got the game during a steam sale and I've played it all the way through now. Was it worth it despite being a 5 year old game that is, atm (though soon will be fixed), singleplayer only, due to the gamespy shutdown? Absolutely! It was a blast! I can count on one finger how many games I've fully finished in the last five years... This game.

 It's not perfect, there was an issue getting it to run with physx where I had to reinstall my physx (I just redl'ed the same driver release I already had from nvidia and clicked the clean install button to have it delete the drivers and reinstall them). The graphics are dated, being a 5 year old 32bit dx9 game, though honestly due to the cell shaded cartoonish/animie like art style the graphics have aged quite gracefully. The storys ending left alot to be desired, and it was a tad shorter than I'd expected. Only about 42 hours to fully complete the main game. The voice acting is limited and the quests are mainly in old school text form.

And there are far from 87 billion guns. More like 8 types (smg, assault, revolver ect) each with Maybe 10 texture models and then a totally random amount and type of bonus stats like +20 reload speed/ +2.5 zoom/ +10 dmg/ ect. These random bonus can occur in 87 billion different combos so.. yah... I'd much prefered if for some of the bonuses like the scope for example there were collectable parts so you could customize your weapon with just the right lvl of zoom rather than being stuck with a random one or not one at all.

Other than that I have few complains of it. It was a throughly enjoyable experiance. I highly recommend getting the GOTY edition as it adds all 4 dlc's to the game each of which is a decently sized expansion to the game adding their own story archs, zones and about 4-8 hours of game play each so basicaly adding 50% more content to the game. Totally worth the $7 I payed though I wouldn't have been disapointed had I got it for $20-30. Really my only regret is waiting 5 years after release to pick it up!"
10910,"I started to play this game and already had all the DLC's
So time spend on game is more than just the base game.

The story of this game is a little flat, no big twists.
Which is not all bad, but it is not the strongest part Borderlands.
The graphics is (my taste) really not bad at all.
Finally something different :-)
The AI is descent.
If you play the missions the level it is intented they are pretty challenging.
Music in the game is nice ( not great nor bad )

Pro's

Art style.
Old fashion gunning down stuff :-)
Classes are destinct enough for another play through


Con's

Flat storyline
this game is for CO-OP, can get pretty boring alone."
10911,"This game takes the upcoming Mad Max: Fury Road movie and puts it (more or less) in the palm of your hands. Beautiful, desolate, western wasteland with lots to shoot and a large sandbox to play in. Sometimes I would play just to shoot skags and watch the sun set!"
10912,awesome gay to play with freinds
10913,"Seriously fun to play.
Help, I might be addicted."
10914,"GOOD GAME , BEST CO-OP GAME :)"
10915,"Borderlands

     It is the first of its kind, a FPS/RPG game. It has cell-shaded graphics which gives it its unique-ness. It has 3 skill trees per class and their are four class. Soldier, Hunter, Berserker, and Siren. They all have different playstyles, but all in all, its the same game. The game is ment for co-op, but the multiplayer is a little odd the PC. I believe steam is adding steamworks though the game is 5 years old. Super-fun shoot and loot, grab a buddy and explore Pandora. I do recommend the DLC, they all have the perks.

Heard you huntin' for that Vault. You know, even if it weren't hogwash, would it matter? What're you gonna do with treasure anyhow? All we got here is mud, guns, and dirt!  -Scooter

10917,this is the shit right here best game ever!
10918,"Borderlands combines the irrational comedy of dark humor and the insanity of thousands of guns.  Compared to Borderlands 2, it holds up nicely with the second game improving on many of the minor issues of the first game (I think the addition of a mini map in Borderlands 2 was a great update)."
10919,just get borderlands 2
10920,"Awesome game. First fps I ever beaten.

10/10

Pros-
High replay Value
Tons of guns
Tons of areas and quests.


Cons-
Not as fun without a bud to coop with ya.
Maybe it was because of my class and level, but
the last few levels before the final boss were really a spike, even if it IS the LAST level."
10921,"Great game, highly recommended!"
10922,"Good storyline, thrilling gameplay and very entertaining mature content. Overall this is one of my favorites of all time, it has everything you need for a good fun shooter. The level and loot system makes this game a topnotch for fun, entertainment and collectables. This game is definately worth checking out if you love a good storyline with a mix of immature adult content, Funny and atractable characters. If you like the game, I really suggest trying out the DLC's as they invite you into different envirorments of pandora (the planet) with challenging opponents and awesome characters."
10923,"Fine post apoclypse rpg,  story line is good playability is good controls are slick. Story is Meh. But hey whop cares about the story when your rpg is an fps :P"
10924,"If you're reading a review for Borderlands.... jeeze go buy this game! Or better yet, get Borderlands 2 and join the rest of us and our bazillion guns :p"
10925,"Super RPG mit einer nicht zu kurzen Story,Super Grafik,man hat was wo man auch mal länger dran sitzt,damit man das höchste Level bekommt und es macht saumäßig Spaß im Co-op Modus (geht leider nicht mehr aber bald).

It hits all the right enterainment buttons and still keeps you going late into the night. The co op is amazing but it still would have been fun to see a lobby, like Phantasy Star Online, to meet everyone in and make groups. If you have not picked this up yet and you like any kind of RPG you are missing a vital piece of gaming history. Get it now!"
10935,"Great Game, the only problem is tha almost all of the misions are the same. but it is still fun to play."
10936,"Awesome in many ways, story, enemies, graphics and enormous number of weapons/items you can mix to create best sets to serve painful death to everything in your way. Advised to play in up to 4 players co-op for better experience. Hours of wasted time on playing this game with no regret :)"
10937,Hours and hours of entertainment. Borderlands 1 and 2 have got to be the best value for money games I have bought in years!
10938,"Gud game, never finished it though due to I had to reinstall windows and I couldn't arse my self to do it ever again, so it is sitting there unfinished."

What is better than tons of action? loot? comedy? 
Even the story is captivating getting into it and leaves you eagerly wanting to play the higher levels. 
The setting and overall theme of the game was done so well and the graphical choices were just utterly brilliant.

10942,borderlands 3 has no borders and the lands don't have borders either what the heck nintendo what kind of poopy butt cheeks are you running scam here i came here for quality realistic train simulation but Hulk Hogan just noped me and stole my butternut squash the biggest disappointment since Citizen Kane 0/10 fun with friends
10943,"It's very nostagic game, very funny. 
Some bugs.. But nevermind ;)"
10944,Awesome game!
10945,I've spent countless hours gunning down enemies with my friends and it never really got old. If you're looking for a game with replayability then i would highly recommend this game. I would recommend aslo that you pick of the GOTY version since the dlc's add plenty to this game
10946,Hours of fun with friends.
10947,such a great game
10948,"Have played this quite a lot, completed it on another platform before but bought it again on pc. It's so good, when it first came out the graphics was thought to be terrible but it was the style of the graphics that helped play up to the name of borderlands. One of the best RPG's i have played, up there with fallout, elder scrolls series. The DLC is well thought out except Underdome. I would recommend this to anyone"
10949,"Borderlands is a stunning game, whether you want to pick off aliens and mutants from a distance or charge in punching faces. This game offers some of the best game mechanics and skill system I have ever seen. Every level up feels beneficial to character progression and the crazy weapons you can find great."
10950,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10951,"Borderlands is a post-apocalyptic world took me by surprise with its unique-style gameplay.  It features a cell-shaded art direction that perfectly matches the rest of the game. The first thing to notice is it's cocaine-like addictiveness.  The combat, which is fun and fluid first-person shooting, results in XP to level up, loot such as upgrades and ammunition, and the key feature of the game, more guns.  Half of the fun comes from finding and using each gun as they only improve with your level.  At its heart, this game is a role-playing game with first-person shooting implementations.  Also it happens to be hilarious.  Definitely one of my top games of all time is Borderlands."
10952,"A. Go somewhere.
B. Kill some creatures. Loot.
C. Flip a switch or something.
D. Kill some more creatures and loot.
E. Success!

That's it. Pretty much.
Co-op is indispensable."
10953,"Very entertaining multiplayer shooter. Game lets you level up and collect loot, so think of it as Diablo having an illegitimate child with Far Cry, except with cel-shaded graphics and a hilarious setting that's like a red neck Treasure Planet.

Not so fun alone. Great with friends!"
10954,"One of the best games i have ever played.
Catch a Ride!

11/10"
10955,if you and your friends like blasting things away or blowing away your friends this is a fun game to have
10956,"I actually played Borderlands 2 first, but had a blast playing the older Borderlands recently."
10957,"I highly recommend this game if u want quick and easy gameplay 4 great dlc one gives u the oppurtunity to get to lvl 69
"
10958,Great Game
10959,It's good. I mean I thought it was good.
10960,"Great game - if you like levelling up, collecting loot (there is A LOT of loot) and shooting things to bits, get this. Will not disappoint. Got the GOTY edition because the DLC is so worth playing. I think the best part is if you're not happy with the way you've built up your character, you can just reset your skill points and reinvest them into something else. Tons of replayability, especially when you have 4 characters who play differently.

Also - Guns. So, so, so many guns."
10961,Excelente jogo. RPG e FPS em uma mistura perfeita
10962,love it!
10963,"This is the game that started the Borderlands franchise. This is a great blend of fps game-play, artistic cel-shaded graphics, and Diablo style loot system. This game had the record for the greatest number of guns in a videogame until Gearbox broke the record with Borderlands 2. If you think that a strange world with fps gameplay, skill trees, and a crazy amount of guns sounds like fun, then this is definitely the game for you (or you and up to three of your friends)."
10964,"There are few games that capture ""fun"" in video games the way that the Borderlands games do."
10965,"Great game, though the sequel is better all around. But this doesn mean this game isnt worth it."
10966,It s a funny game
10967,A fantastic game by any measure.  I've found it to be slightly harder than [url=store.steampowered.com/app/49520]B2[/url].  The UI isn't quite as polished (oh how I miss the inventory tagging system in B2) but is certainly adequate. A must buy for fans of the genre (which it helped create).
10968,"Considering how cheap you can get the GOTY edition nowadays, there's no reason not to get this game. It's a great mix of FPS, RPG, and Diablo-ish looting that will keep anyone entertained. Add on the DLC and the different ways the characters play and you have dozens of hours of play time."
10969,"An excellent cooperation game, even though it is still great excperience to play alone."
10970,"Only addictive when playing co-op, playing by yourself and it gets boring"
10971,Good to play with friends :3
10972,THIS IS THE TITS
10973,"Giving this a thumbs up because I'm a big fan of Borderlands 2. However, very shortly after playing this one, you can tell how and why BL2 exists. It's a great foundation, but was never taken to that next level. I feel weird walking around... like the camera is out in front of my body a foot or two. The menus and text are layed out odd. Coloring in area's feel weird.

It's like they took a great concept and brought it to 95% complete. In BL2, you can tell a HUGE difference in just how everything feels. If you're looking to get more out of your Borderlands story and haven't played this, go for it. If you're new to Borderlands, i'd recommend BL2. You won't miss much, and you'll get a much better finely tuned product."
10974,YES!
10975,"that moment of pure
concentrated breathless thrill
when the chest unfolds"
10976,"If you want a quick summary, it's like a stripped down version of Fallout New Vegas - on acid... on another planet... and you can drive. It's essentially Mad Max, the game.

I'm totally enjoying this. I don't know why it's took me so long to get around to playing it, but I spyed my chances for the GOTY edition in a sale, and here we are! The open world is very trippy and brutal.

I recommend the GOTY edition, because it comes with all DLC, which allows you to expand on the story, but also has a handy feature that allows you to store items from your backpack - believe me, it's EXTREMELY helpful."
10977,"One of the best games in my opinion. Well worth your money if you don't get bored with desert environments. Of course, Pandora is a barren wasteland so it makes perfect sense. Except, FOR THE ZOMBIES! Yes, there are zombies. Basically, my favorite enemies next to The Crimson Lance. The Zombies are a pain in the buttocks if you don't like being slowed down by cheap vomit (Yes, they vomit at you from a great distance.) Fortunately, The Zombies are only for The Island of Dr Ned DLC. I won't recommend this if you get tired of BEING SLOWED DOWN. The Crimson Lance appear in The Main Storyline, some sub quests, and The Armory of General Knoxx. General Knoxx's leader is a 3-5 year old. (Yes, really.) Basically, he hates Pandora and wants to leave The Crimson Lance. It's also a DLC. The Clap Trap Robolution, is my #1 favorite DLC. You are basically killing Clap-Trapped hive mind wild life, Hyperion Soldiers (Non corrupt dudes. Handsome Jack is a lowly ranked member of The Hyperion Corporation at this time, no need for spoiler alerts, this game has been here FOR A LONG TIME.) If you don't know who Handsome Jack is, he's the OTHER Final boss in Borderlands 2. The Warrior's the main Final Boss...course, I personally use an OP-ed Golden Chest Rocket Launcher to dispatch of The Handsome One and laugh at him as if a measly Corporation could defeat I, General Morden of The Rebel Army! Gah, too much off-topic. Great Game over-all."

10979,"[h1]Classic shooter with the most guns EVER[/h1]

Even after all these years, the original Borderlands feels like a true classic, playing it like coming home - even for a short time - to a well-known spot. The story is more than decent, although a bit drawn-out: you're a vault-hunter, lookng for the ultimate prize on a most inhostible planet, Pandora. You make progress through the vast landscapes of the planet, fighting lots and lots of monsters, bad-guys, and some VERY badass bossess (they're even labelled as such!). The actual fighting and shooting is extremely well done: every gun, every type of weapon has a great ""feeling"" to it and firing it is very satisying.

But there is more, much more to Borderlands. First of all, there are literally thousands, nay, hundreds of thousands of guns waiting to be looted. The game makes use of a random-generated drop-system, with ligher level enemies dropping more interesting and more unique loot. These are devided into several colours, with white being the most common ones, and going right up to purple and very rare green items. This system just works perfectly for me: it's so satisfying to keep on fighting, just hoping for that even better gun to drop.

But Borderlands is not only a very well crafted first-person shooter, it's also a RPG up to a certain extent. There is some sort of levelling-system which gives you action points, to be invested in better skills. You can also choose from four quite different classes at the beginning of the game, and having played each of them, I can say that all four have a unique feel to them. This really augments the singleplayer experience! As for multiplayer, it's almost - but not quite! - dead by now, but you really want this game for the immersive, action-packed singleplayer. Highly recommended!

Gameplay: 25/30
Graphics: 16/20 (shell-shaded and very atmospheric, but sometimes a tad dull, brown and grey)
Sound: 7/10 (I like the totally different gun-sounds, but ambietent sounds could have been better)
Replayability/longelivety: 14/20 singleplayer has really tons of gameplay, potentially you could play four times as each class)
Technical/stability: 18/20 (very smooth experience, tons of options to scale according to your rig)

Overall: 80/100

Played on a Intel Core2 Duo @2,66 GHz; Radeon HD 5850 & 4GB RAM"
10980,"Really good game, could play it for hours"
10981,<3
10982,"I honestly wasn't all that impressed. Sure, it was fun (which is why I still ""recommend"" it), but I don't think I enjoyed it as much as everyone else has. Music was bland and the story was unimaginitave, even for a shooter. I've played Call of Duty games that had better story than this.

My first major complaint would be the atmosphere of the game. Maybe I'm just weird, but I don't find junk cities all that exciting in games. And this wasn't a single junk city in a game filled with other, richer cities. This was a whole goddamned PLANET of junk. The only ""rich"" place I saw was the military base....and even that was pretty junky. I guess the alien ruins kinda-sorta count too, since they look like they USED to be rich.

My second, and probably biggest complaint are the enemies....or rather, the LACK of enemies. I can understand killing the same shit over and over when running through the same damn area, but throughout the whole damn game? That's just lazy design. Sure, the enemies were SLIGHTLY more powerful as you went along.....but it was still the same old shit over and over and over and over and over and over....... Worst part is they didn't even bother with pallette swaps. It was literally the exact same enemy, only a little bit stronger. Woohoo. Even most of the bosses were rehashed versions of the regular enemies. Easy to see humans being largely the same (and even then, you could've used a LOT more different clothing styles), but couldn't they have at least come up with more monsters?

Another complaint: the difficulty. WAAAAAAAAY too easy, ESPECIALLY after you get the vehicle. Probably 60% of the enemies I fought in between the beginning and end of the game were ""fought"" by running them over with the car with no effort whatsoever (except the effort to press the ""w"" button and move the mouse around a bit. SO HARD). Sure, the vehicle took some damage....but nowhere near enough to be of any concern. Especially considering that the vehicle can recharge health. It's slow, but it recharges, and it's not that difficult to find a safe place for repair. Even some of the bosses were ""fought"" this way. Only real fighting took place in areas where the car couldn't go.

Finally: the bugs/glitches. Or just one, really. There were a LOT of times where I found myself stuck in terrain that I really shouldn't find myself stuck in. Often it happened when sticking close to the walls, but it also happened a lot OUT IN THE OPEN WITH NO POTHOLE/BUMPS/ETC WHATSOEVER ANYWHERE NEAR THE AREA. Usually this was easily resolved just by simply moving around in random directions until you got unstuck, but there were a few areas where I had to outright exit the game and re-enter to respawn back at the start of the map.

Overall, the experience was about the same amount of enjoyment as a Call of Duty game. Fun, yes, but not by much. Nowhere near enough to warrant excitement for pre-ordering the next installment, or even playing it shortly after release. The game is BARELY worth the $20 pricetag years after release."

[*] Overall great game"
10985,"Good game.  Decent graphics.  Easy to play alone, but more fun with a buddy.  Definitely helpful to team up for the big challenges."
10986,A very fun game but I would recomend playing with friends.
10987,"Had I known this game was this good, I could have paid full price for it and not regretted it. It's incredibly fun and there is still so much more to do and explore even after you beat the game."
10988,amzing game brand new good graphics great coop
10989,bang bang good game 10/10
10990,Fun game.
10991,Too many guns
10992,"Got a explosive assult rifle, blew everything up
10/10"
10993,Always a fun game. Solo or with friends.
10994,"While the story line is anti-climactic, it is an interesting blend of Diablo 2 with FPS. The art style and the music add great flavor while the NPCs are hilarious. Suffers a bit from consolitis."
10995,you try playing the first level five times and never getting any further because your friends keep restarting and tell me it's a fun game
10996,im gonna fuck the game
10997,Like Diablo but FPS with guns....Awesome!!!!
10998,Just amazing 10/10
10999,"If you haven't played it yet, you're missing out.
But do not play Borderlands 2 before this, as even though it adds new stuff, it will make the 'new' elements of Borderlands feel stale, and you'll be missing out on an amazing story."
11000,Great game. very fun
11001,When this first came out I had over 300 hours into it. I'm excited to fully immerse myself in it again. I do have to say I prefer the first over the Sequel.
11002,"I love this game, id recommend it to anyone who wants a game to play through with a couple of friends and the DLC's are good fun aswell.

Also very easy to get all the vanilla achivments on it aswell aslong as your up for some xp grinding."
11003,"First off: This game is not as varyed with Maps as Borderlands 2, but this game is still dang fun! Most of the Maps are sort of Badlands like and are rather the same, but this game has incredible action (not as much humour as BL2) and some good.... Driving. You'll need good driving skills. The guns are still epic to wield and the enemies hard to beat. Its much more connected with the maps, purely because they're so close.
Not as good as Borderlands 2, but its Much better than Half the games you'll find on the market.

89/100 For Me, although remember this is opinion based, so if you are wary about buying this game, then get it on sale."
11004,Very sexy 10/10
11005,"If u dont know that this is the best game ever already than just dont, ok. 
10/10 all the way
"
11006,It's kind of like dust II but different.
11007,"The Good: Surprisingly addictive combination of RPG and FPS. Crazy guns! Great art style and atmosphere.

The Bad: The gun drops are a bit too random and a lot of the guns are garbage if you settle into a gun type. The ending of the game is a bit underwhelming.

Overall: Definitely worth a playthrough especially with friends!"
11008,"Eh. Borderlands is a very interesting game, its art style and design is definitely unique (though ripped off of a 2006 short film Codehunters) compared to other RPG games of a similar nature. The problem is that Gearbox (whose other ""games"" aren’t exactly classics) seems to have dressed up the game in an attempt to hide what it really is: a repetitive barebones shooter. I don't recommend this (just barely) because I was honestly getting a headache from grinding. Cycling through guns that don't feel like they have any power every 15 minutes, every single mission is just clearing campsites of dudes, and vehicles that are just awful to drive. It probably is more enjoyable on co-op, but I’m not really sold here. If this review system thingy wasn’t a simple “Yay or Nay” system I’d give this game a 6/10. Hell, I’ll give it a 7/10 on a good day, it just gets tiresome."
11009,"Then, I did every sidequest and one of the DLCs during PT1. 
Now, running around in PT2, murdering bosses with one or two shots and being a sad panda, because I'm overleveled as hell. 

Otherwise: A+, 10/10, would bang."
11010,"Good, dumb fun, kind of like an FPS Diablo-clone with more static environments and a whole lot more self-aware parody.  The fetch quests do get old after a while, though, and some serious boredom sets in during the final act, ultimately leading up to a disappointing and underwhelming end boss.  This was still worth the fire sale price I paid for it, but you might want to skip this one and move on to the sequel, which has a more engaging story (such as it is) and at least somewhat refines the stupidly crude inventory mechanics of the original."
11011,Borderlands? more like BOREDLANDS HAH
11012,"Lovely game, had an absolute blast with it. Get the GOTY Version though, cuz while the story's really long you'll be aching for more once it's over and the DLC's are actually quite fleshed out and funny."
11013,Just downloaded Borderlands! Loved this game on the XBOX and decided to pick it up again on the PC.  The FPS aspect is great and the loot is awesome.  Loved the different characters and classes but Lilith will always be my favorite. Go go Siren! Can't wait to spend countless hours on this game again!
11014,"Borderlands is and always will be one of my favorite FPS.  I love the fact that they incoporporated the ""loot and boot"" system which really made me appreciate the Diablo games so much.  It is a great game and I would recommend anyone who loves FPS and RPGs to play this game."
11015,"borderlands is just a complete beast, side quest, great story line, humor, and very interesting characters. I honestly have to rate this a 9/10 just u know its hard to find the perfect game"
11016,One of the best games I've picked up in a while.  Definitely recommend.
11017,"I have bought borderlands, because my friends wanted me to play it. I really enjoyed playing the game, it is a lot of fun, but heres why I dont recommend it. This was really annoying, I would click play, and it would show the borderlands first little screen, then it goes to full screen with the screen all black, and then it acts as if it is minimizing the game. I would re-click the borderlands many of times, and same results. Well, I ended up restarting my computer, and then it finally worked. Then I got on in the morning no problem, and then I crashed, and tried to re-lauch the program. Same thing. I have restarted my computer multiple times, and still nothing. The game is really fun though, I enjoyed playing Online games with friends. I feel like this was a waste of my money, and I am very dissapointed. I do not recommend this game."
11018,"Fisted a skag's mouth repeatedly while playing as the berserker and eventually killing it.

11/10"
11019,"Interesting visuals, but otherwise extremely boring, too many animations that can't be skipped, anonymous guns, invincible enemies, annoying bot. Not worth my time."
11020,"fun game specielly with some friends cellshaded grafic feels like a cartoon 



60/100"
11021,"Always wanted to shoot alien dogs in the face with rockets.

Great game, especially played with your friends."
11022,Wow
11023,ALRIGHT BOYS TAKE EM OUT
11024,"Great game to play with a friend or a couple of friends, provides endless hours of play time."
11025,"Tons of fun. Better played with friends, but cool enough as a single player. Handling the amount of loot can get somewhat annoying but awesome none the less."
11026,Is good game
11027,"I found rockets in a washing machine.
BEST GAME EVAR!!!!!"
11028,"FPS? check
Open world (sandbox)? check
Fun fights? check
Replayability?? Double check

This game was fun as hell and all i wanna do is get back in to play some more... but alas.... i have to spend time with my own personal midget (my daughter) before I can get back to shooting mental midgets in the face... This game quickly jumped into my top 5.... 

11/10"
11029,"Love the borderlands series, i like the cartoonish graphics, the challenge of levels, and grouping of enemies on a fairly open map section."
11030,"Now what to say about this game? Basically it's an FPS. Just an FPS, nothing more. It's got a repetitive gameplay, boring story, it's loaded with bugs and glitches.. Has some good moments, which are still not enough to save it. For what comes to buying it, do not. Unless you are a console player with low brain capacity. In that case, you will probably love this game."
11031,"One of the best games, ever."
11032,"GAMES AMAZING,FUN,EXCITING,DELIGHTFUL,JOYFUL,ENTERTAINING realy gives you a good time
"
11033,"Borderlands is one of my favourite games. I played it on PS3 and decided to re-buy it on Steam and loved every minute of the 37 hours I played it. The art style is incredibly appealing to look at and the writing is well written and witty. The story might not be very good, as I forgot it was there at times until the end on the way to the vault. All of the characters are well designed and have good voice acting, but I felt like wanting to know more about characters like Marcus and Scooter. The co-op is a fun little addition, but I preferred to play alone only because that's the way I play games. There isn't a lot of variety in the enemies and it got a bit boring killing the same people over and over again. But all in all, Borderlands is a must play for anyone who is into first-person shooters and RPG's.

8.9/10"
11034,"This game is awesome. While the stylized design of the game takes a little while to get used to, everything about this game is beautiful. The landscapes are great, the guns are awesome and completely customizable, and the story is good. I would definitely reccomend"
11035,"""Im going to cut you till you bleed blood"" Just yes"
11036,"The Origin of the RPG FPS, this game is the where you start to understand the great combination."
11037,"Fun, yet light hearted! The range of guns make this a must have game."
11038,AWEESSOOOMMEEE!!!!!!
11039,it has a great story line grafics are awesome and all in all its just a great shooter
11040,Simply delicious!
11041,"Its one of those games I just keep going back to, i played hundreds of hours on Console, And when I got my Pc it was an Instra-Buy for me.

It is worth while to note that the game does have a small modding community, Check up on that :D

If you've never played this Play it, If you've only played BL2 play this."
11042,"The game rules! I can't get enough of it. Will try to play with all characters to see which one is the best. :)
Awesome game, well done to developers and many hours of joy to the players."
11043,This game is amazing. I got the bundle with Borderlands 2 and Borderlands GOTY during the Summer Sale and I don't regret it. Borderlands mixes my 2 favorite genres; shooters and RPGs. They did a marvelous job. Just note that the game is from 2009 so don't expect perfect graphics.
11044,Like Fallout but want more color and more to shoot at and actually be able to drive a vehicle? Give this game a shot. It's has great music and atmosphere and lots of missions that make you want to keep going as see what you can get. 8/10 Multiplayer matchmaking could be better.
11045,"Very very fun game.  It provided me enough fun to cover it's worth and ten times more.  I highly recommend this game as it is even fun through the second playthrough.  Also if you are like me and get the DLC, thats an awesome way to get some awesome weapons.

Rating: 8.7/10"
11046,"Fantastic fun, lots of loot. Good story to go along with total decimation of psychos."
11047,"I have had regrets in my life, one of the biggest being the investment of time into this game. I only even managed to complete this game out of some warped sense of duty to finish what I started. Online co-op, solo, LAN, no matter how you play this game, it's torture. The environment the game takes place in is a veritable wasteland of feces. Playing this game was one of the most boring and useless things I have ever done with my life and I wish I could have back the hours I threw away on this atrocious crime against humanity."
11048,"Fell asleep almost every time I ran the game.

Was awake long enough to get bored once."
11049,This game is a plot twist with plot twists
11050,"Rarely does a game couple great gameplay and fun story. Borderlands aces both. Don't worry about the cartoon graphics, you get used to it quickly. It does have a problem with level progression on the late game, so don't grind too much.

If you like to shoot and laugh this is the best deal you'll find. Story DLCs highly recommended but not required."
11051,Absolutely amazing game! I recommend this to everyone. The DLC's also are a great plus to this game.
11052,"This game is so brainless ... and maybe therfore so much fun. I did not expect to have so much fun with this game, which basically is a more sophisticated version of serious Sam :) 92 hours playtime speaks for itself."
11053,Such a Badass Game ! especially fun with friends ! :D 10/10
11054,The only FPS greater than Borderlands is Borderlands 2.
11055,It's a must get for ppl that have not experienced how it all began!!!
11056,Absolutely Godly!
11057,Great game. You will tire yourself out trying to do the whole thing with all the DLC.
11058,In a word: Awesome

11062,The DLC keys are invalid and do not work. It's basically BL1 alone...
11063,"All around fun game, with a large weapon selection. Great game to play with friends."
11064,"Good content, missions, graphics, characters, voice acting, combat. Really really fun to just play through over and over again."
11065,"If you plan on playing the Borderlands series for the very first time, I definitely suggest starting with the first game. You may think that this is customary, and 'of course i'll start with the first game!"" but i'm warning you that if you start with BL2 and go back to play the first game, you may get bored. The first game is not as story heavy and the characters you meet don't quite feel as important or connected as they do in the second game. But the first is still definitely worth playing and is a good introduction to the world of Pandora!"
11066,Love it !!
11067,"Let's just start off by saying I usually don't like FPS games, but the Borderlands series is a whole different ballpark.  I love the looting system, the fights and bosses and characters all make for a most memorable experience.  I would recommend this game to anybody who likes FPS or RPG games for it is a brilliant combination of the two."
11068,good game.
11069,Very Good
11070,"stupid, mindless, annoying game i have 13 hours on and thought i only had 1"
11071,shoot and loot 101
11072,"This game is just pure annoying crap compared to Borderlands 2
you must be a total idiot to say this is better! (these 2 games are not on the same level at all)

note: this is not worth getting now that the other exist"
11073,"A decent shooter. Although the gunplay doesnt have much weight behind it, the randomly generated loot and pretty decent gameplay make it worth a play. More so if you have people to play it with."
11074,"What can I say? Guns, Guns, and more Guns! Get it and Love it!"
11075,"As soon as I saw the trailer for Borderlands I fell in love with it, The quests are interesing and the game is quirky. Very funny dialog and worth a play."
11076,I set all my enemies on fire.
11077,You get to feed old people dog food. 10/10
11078,you shoot shit and run even more shit over btw that red head has some nice titties
11079,"Too many of my friends liked and recommended this game to me, so I bought it at a sale. And I didn't like it....

Yeah, at first I thought this game sucked. There wasnt much going on, it was slow, and there was just crap to do all around. But this all changed when I moved on.

I soon hit loads and loads of jokes and hidden content, weapons that did insane things, and overall mayhem and fun. It was great. I finally understood what the game was about.

It's a really good game with an absolutely unique design. But beware, it's a hit or miss for some."
11080,Best Lootin Simulator Ever! 10/10
11081,"To start, if you are looking to get a Borderlands game, this is not what you want. Borderlands 2 GOTY is the same price, with far more content, better graphics, better story, gameplay improvements, and closer to true Steam integration. This game is older, and really shows the age. Securom and Gamespy features were only removed in 2014. B-lands 2 is just better.

I like the idea of an FPS-RPG. The execution here is mediocre, with weak weapons and bullet-sponge enemies. Normal RPGs raise stats with levels, so your character strengthens independent of loot. Here, RPG elements are just 1 active ability and a pitiful tree of uninteresting passives. Your health pool does increase with levels, but shields make health pointless. The main damage scaling not based on random drops is the weapon-type level. However, this system just pushes you to use 1 type of weapon entirely, or lose damage by switching to a new type. This makes the Eridian class of weapons feel weak, as they will be level 1 in the last third of the game. In dozens of hours, at character level 47, I still haven't maxed out the shotgun type despite using shotguns most of the game.

Shooter fans will likely be underwhelmed here, as the combat is unsatisfying with RPG variables. One-hit kills are rare, and bosses have no unique skills to challenge players. My RPG side is also bored, as the progression system is meaningless. I've only had a few pieces of high-level loot to look forward to equipping. Everything is guns, shields, and class mods, so it's easy to establish a full build that will last for days as you wrap up the game.

As for wrapping the game up, it seems the developers didn't want you to finish it anytime soon. Many of the DLC quest lines involve grinding up hundreds to thousands of random drops, or fighting the same bosses again and again, or grinding reused enemies for 6 hours straight in the Arena. The game's visual style is unique, but becomes bland after seeing the same areas and reused assets and repeated enemies. Add onto that the same repeating jokes from said repeating enemies, and I hope you didn't want anything new in the last dozen hours of gameplay.

The ideas may have been unique in 2008, but the game failed to take real chances even on release. Destiny seems to suffer some of the same design issues, turning gameplay into a grind. If you want a co-op shooter, I'd really recommend Payday 2. If you HAVE to jump on a loot treadmill of junk weapons, see Borderlands 2. If you can live without FPS, go for a real MMORPG. This game, however, is still overpriced and the sequel is a better game."
11082,da
11083,Its a great game and i would highly recommend it to friends! There really aren't that many people on the online coop though so  if anyone wants to play id be glad to friend you!
11084,"The Borderlands series is easily one of the best video game series out there. BAZILLIONS of guns, LOADS of fun, and SO much replayability."
11085,issss guhhhhhuuudd
11086,"Unfortunately as a borderlands 2 fan, this game sucks, the storyline is blunt, voice acting is bad, the A.I. is really dumb, loads of bugs and full of over used, bad jokes. If you wish to get a borderlands game, get the second one. It is better in every way possible."
11087,"This is a game that has awesome action, great enemies, a lot to explore, to buy and also is great to play with friends."
11088,best game of the year
11089,You like RPGs? you like FPSs? I don't care! this is borderlands! blow up a midget  with a sniper rifle!
11090,borderlands is a great game i love 10/10
11091,"You're not a skag, are ya?"
11092,Good Game for everybody
11093,can shoot shit
11094,"This game is unreal, it is fun, funny, and just plain amazing."
11095,"By far, my favorite game ever."
11096,For a 5 year old game this holds up really well. 5 years later and my 3rd time through this game is still awesome. :D
11097,AMAZING :D :D :D
11098,"I love this game, but will never ever play it with my boyfriend, because I'm too scared of looking and feeling like a complete and utter newblet."
11099,"Great gameplay, great story, and just alot of fun 30/7"
11100,In my opinion this one is better than the second. Not to say the second one is a bad game by any means but I personally found this one more enjoyable to beat several times. Do your self a favor and pick up both of them!
11101,"Borderlands is an absolute buy. It's a little slow going in the beginning, because money is hard to come by. Once you get a good weapon set, and learn the general areas to look for items to sell, it gets a lot easier. I have completed the first play through, and most of the DLC. If not for Borderlands 2 waiting in my library, I would be starting a second play through as soon as I get finished with the DLC. If you like FPS and/or RPG, you should check out Borderlands.

Since the multiplayer was tied to GameSpy, I didn't get to play with anyone. For your first playthrough, I recommend Roland. His turret is pretty close to having someone there helping to take down your enemies. In fact, by the end of the game, I could let my turret kill bosses without assistance. Ammo was never a problem, because the turret can replenish ammo and health."
11102,"I origonally owned this game for the Xbox, still do, and I played it all the way through 4 times not including all the DLC. I recently bought the game a second time for the PC so I can play it again. Even though I know where everything is and I know the whole story I am having a BLAST playing this game. that is how well this game holds up. Definitely one of my favorite games."
11103,Brilliant!!!
11104,"oh you like this scoped weapon you found that does fire damage? well here is the same exact thing in yellow and no scop or fire power, but does 20 damage more.

what? you found a weapon you found you really like it? sorry, you can shoot that weapon until you are level 20"
11105,The original is definitely worth playing. I highly enjoyed the blend of a FPS that allowed you to build your character around your playstyle. However fun this game is in a single player environment is easily doubled when playing with friends. The game scales the difficulty based on the number of players. Higher difficulty means better loot for you and your friends. The DLC content was rather enjoyable as well. With the sheer number of optional quest to take it can be daunting at times especially as you need to get to a higher level to complete story missions. All in all I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a FPS.
11106,Awesome game with characters and scenes you can really enjoy.
11107,It's a post-apocalyptic first person Diablo.
11108,Killer fun
11109,"This game and it's sequel are definitely worth the buy. When my brother got this back in '09 he almost sold it right after he bought it cause the game was too cartoony looking for him, and man was I happy I bought it from him instead.

It's a great overall shooter game and the rpg elements are a nice touch too without drawing too much time from the firefights. Some people didn't like the cartoony style the game went for although the game was originally not cell shaded at all before release but I'm glad they went with it, because in my opinion it helps draw you into the games atmosphere more.

One particular thing I didn't care for was while it isn't really any ""harder""(enemies difficulty is dynamic depending on player count at least) in singleplayer, the game doesn't feel as lively in my opinion without at least one other person in your game which might be a bummer for some people. The game is mostly frenetic combat built for co-op and the engine actually encourages co-op because it increases the difficulty of the enemies and in-turn the enemies drop potentially rarer and more powerful weaponry/loot, so considering the game was designed specifically for co-op in mind it can be argued it's a worthwhile tradeoff for less enjoyable solo play for some people.

All in all though it is a great game and I highly recommend getting it if you're a fan of loot fest games and shooters with sprinkled rpg elements."
11110,"An absolute must play for all the rps fans out there. Lots of humour, lots of weapons and explosions, lots of monsters and men to burn, electrocute, melt, or simply explode with a selection of weaponry that will blow your mind.
Every character in this game will make you wonder what they're made of, and if you get the chance to play with friends, the multiplayer experience will win you over."
11111,screen tearing
11112,One of the best games of all time in my opinion.
11113,"Got it when it was a newcomer to the FPS/Co-op/RPG genre.  Enjoyed it very much, great graphics, mechanics and team play.  Unique characters and tons of guns to experiment with.  Lots of territory to explore.  Get the DLC once you've completed everything and maxed levels.  Only complaint was the lack of steam cloud, it used gamespy or something else back then."
11114,"I guess it's ok if you have someone to play with. The driving part of this game makes it a whole lot better, and funnier :P The graphics are alright, very different from other games I play. I just don't care for running around the same places and doing quests, but I'll give this a yes recommendation for those who can pick it up for cheap."
11115,It is a fantastic game 10/10
11116,Get Borderlands 2 instead.
11117,awesome loot and shoot game.
11118,"First things first I would consider this game a classic. It combines a RPG with co-op that works together brilliantly. not really a game you want to play alone though, be sure to have some friends who got your back. Overall Borderlands is a great game. get the GOTY edition, it will help a lot with story in BL2 and their just plain fun"
11119,"A great overall game with fantastic gameplay, great dialogue, and an interesting story. Definitely more fun in co-op mode than soloing. DLC is a must as well"
11120,This game makes no sense.
11121,"I punched a skag.



10/10."
11122,"설정파일을 건드려서 FOV를 바꿔야지 어지럽지 않고 할만하다.
벌레가 너무 많이 나와서 좀 그렇지만 재미는 보장한다.
2편을 먼저 했으면 1편에 실망을 많이 할지도 모르겠다."
11123,Fun game. Kind of like Diablo but with guns and First person perspective.
11124,The game is great for a break from real life from killing some bandits to fighting those cursed skag this game is a hit!
11125,"Spent many hours playing this game, then did the second run through.  Wish I'd spent more time doing some of the DLC missions before starting the second run through... wow."
11126,"I would hate to say no because I enjoy both borderlands games very much but there is one problem with this game. THE GENERAL PROTECTION ERROR. I have no idea how to fix it and I have spent more hours trying to fix it than playing the game. Granted I was only able to play the game only for a whopping 3 days after I bought it.

Nevermind. I just had to update my PhysiX driver...."
11127,Loved this game!
11128,SHOOT THOSE PYCHOS!

11133,"Highly addictive.
Great Replay Value.
Fun to play as a single player game but would recommend playing this in Coop.
Big issue with game was the driving as you can get caught in invisible barriers quite a lot which is quite frustrating. 
Story was ok but you don't really play these games for the story.
DLCs are great.
Get the GOTY edition.
Overall Score: 8.5/10"
11134,I love it
11135,"Highly recommended if you like your FPS genre.

Had this on the XBox 360 and recently got this and havent regretted the purchase. Still really enjoy it."
11136,This was a throwaway item in a collection pack... almost 700 hours invested speak for themselves.
11137,Worst. Game. Ever. Ruined my life.
11138,"This game is a really great! It is very unique and creates it's own style of gameplay, textures, characters, and guns. If you do play this game, I would recommend making a friend or two to buy this game too; It is a lot more fun playing co-op. The great thing about this game is that you dont have to make a server in order to play with your friends. You simply click the ""online game"" button and choose the type of game you want, then just invite your friends. The one complaint I have about this game is the driving system. Instead of using ""a"" or ""d"" keys, you use your mouse to steer; not a big deal at all, i Just thought i'd mention it. Overall, I would give this game a 9.3/10."

11140,Just sheer AWESOME.
11141,"This game was my gateway drug to enjoying singleplayer experiences. I used to primarily play multiplayer shooters like Battlefield, but I decided to give Borderlands a go during a long vacation and I got sucked in hard. It's difficult to compare to other ""questy"" games when this was my first... I even like it more than Borderlands 2. Just the right combination of atmosphere, discovery, challenge and tight gunplay. 

Just like Sade once sang... it's never as good as the first time."
11142,I'm sure most people have read enough reviews of this game to know whether to buy it or not.  I have to admit that the concept is great (FPS RPG) but the execution leaves a bit to be desired.  It's just a bit too heavy on equipment needs to be fun but I'll still play through the game.  It just gets a bit frustrating when you can't progress due to lack of items and not skill.
11143,"Fantastic, great style, this game is fun even if you don't like shooters, plays well with a controller, and might make you laugh. Worth the time if you skipped it."
11144,"Borderlands is an outstandingly fun to play game. With the intreaging story line and rememberable characters the game will ingrose you in the hours. The various wepons bring an intresting way toward fighting your enemies and customizing how you fight them. The fun is even doubled, trippled, or even quadrupaled with up to 3 additional players you can play with online. I've played the game once though just by myself but still am having fun playing this game with my friends beating the story together with new ways possible. I still have yet to pick up Borderlands 2 but after playing Borderlands, I without a doubt am fully excited to play this new game. But for now I'll still happily be playing Borderlands with my friends and you should definatly too."
11145,Love this game.
11146,"11/10

Rich story!

great guns!

Its like christmas!"
11147,I absolutely love this game. Great buy!
11148,The game so nice I bought it twice.  The original loot-n-shoot that defined the RPS genre.
11149,Best game in the world!
11150,this is one snazzy game. yep.
11151,very very good game!
11152,"There are few games that I would ever give the title of ""Epic"". Mostly because that terms is sadly applied to every mediocre title or franchise that comes down the pike, that it's really lost all clout. However, Borderlands is a title, if not a franchise, that deserves such a monicker.

Right from the opening movie, the game immerses you into the world of Pandora as seen through the eyes of four ""Vault Hunters"" seeking a legend told to them in youth. But Pandora isn't your usual Sci Fi planet filled with green skinned women and chest bursting aliens. Rather, it's the bastard child of a massive scrap yard and the movie 'Deliverance', as mountains of discarded trash make up the scenery and most of the inhabitance would rather fornicate with your corpse rather than talk to you. Laden with the blackest of humor, characters that are both hilarious and creepy, Borderlands is an experience that should be a part of every game collection. 

Mechanical speaking, you will find few titles as sound as this. Playable on both high power PCs and even strip down models, the FPS mechanics are impeccably done, merging gun and run with special abilities and traits that make each hunter an experience in themselves to play. This title is a must for co-op players who are looking for a game that they will play over and over again. DLC is solid, and gives a great in between for players that still want to experience Borderlands without playing the main title, or sinking to play the horribly sub-par sequel. 

This game will give you it's worth, even at full price. I've owned it for a few years now, and I still go back with my friends and play it through again, still finding new guns and items not found in previous playthroughs."
11153,"What can I say, man? Borderlands was what brought me back to video gaming. No, seriously. Sure, I would pick up a Halo disc and dust it off every once in a while, and I would play Call of Duty with a few friends once a year (if that), but then Borderlands came out. It had everything. It was funny, daring, adventurous, a bit scary at times (I really hate scythids), and really (REALLY) cool. My only complaint has ever been that there was no major feeling of accomplishment once you won, but it really was the journey that was important in Borderlands, and that was done brilliantly."
11154,Amazing :3
11155,Ain't No Rest For The Wicked
11156,"This is a first time review for me but here goes: Borderlands is FANTASTIC... it is a colourful game with a great sense of humour, fantastic gunplay and a world open enough to be exciting but not so spacious to distract from the sheer action and awesomeness the game has to offer. Even on my poor laptop using an AMD radeon 7650m and at a resolution of 1280x720 the game still looks amazing. I did have some drop in frames when i tried to use max setting but that is not ideal for a shooter and will detract from the game. I rate this 10/10 and cant wait to play borderlands 2.

P.S I have only played the single player campaign up till now so i have no comment on multiplayer."
11157,"Great game, i couldnt stop playing"
11158,Ain't No Rest For The Wicked! =D
11159,"This game can last so many playthroughs. I absolutely love this game for it's humor, rpg elements, and most of all GUNS! Seriously though if you can afford this you should pick this up right now."
11160,don't buy this game its broken and you won't recieve a refund for wasting your time on money. if the game wasn't broken it would be broken but its full of crashes.
11161,"Ok, so I played BL2 first, then borderlands, which is the wrong order.   BL2 is mostly a better version.

Still, that said, the core gameplay is still there.  BL1 starts slow, it takes time for your class skills to kick in, before that you don't really feel special.   but once you get to lvl 20 or so, you really get rolling.

If you find the game of the year edition on sale, and you have coop buddies, it's a romp.   Get BL2 if you have to pick only one, but they are cheap nowaways, wait for a sale and get both.
"
11162,Its fun to play with friends but realatively short game. sorta sad I missed the summer sale deal for the second one.
11163,"John Freeman who was Gordon Freemans brother was one day in an office typing on a computer. He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went.
John Freeman got his computer shut down and wet on the platform to go up to the roof of the building where he left his motorcycle and normal people close because he was in his office lab coat. John Freeman got on his motorcycl and said ""its time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences"" so he had to go.
John Freeman ramped off the building and did a backflip and landed. He kept driving down the road and made sure there was no zombies around because he ddint have weapon.
The contrysides were nice and the plants were singing and the birds and the sun was almost down from the top of the sky. the mood was set for John Freemans quest to help his brother where he was. John Freeman looked around the countrysides and said ""its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys"".
John Freeman was late so he had to drive really fast. A cop car was hiden near by so when John Freeman went by the cops came and wanted to give him a ticket. Here John Freeman saw the first monster because the cop was posessed and had headcrabs.
""I cant give you my lisense officer"" John Freeman said
""Why not?"" said the headcrab oficer back to John Freeman.
""Because you are headcrab zombie"" so John Freeman shot the oficer in the head and drove off thinking ""my brother is in trouble there"" and went faster.
John Freeman had to go faster like the speed of sound and got there fast because Gordon needed him where he was. John Freeman looked at road signs and saw ""Ravenholm"" with someons writing under it saying ""u shudnt come here"" so John Freeman almost turned around but heard screaming like Gordon so he went faster again.
John Freeman drove in and did another flip n jumped off his motorbike and the motor bike took out some headcrab zombies infront of John Freeman. John Freeman smiled and walked fast. John Freeman then looked on the ground and found wepon so he pickd it up and fired fast at zombie goasts in front of a house.
John Freeman said ""Zombie goasts leave this place"" and the zombie goasts said ""but this is our house"" and John Freeman felt sorry for them becaus they couldnt live there anymore because they were zombie goasts so he blew up the house and killed the zombie goasts so they were at piece.
Then John Freeman herd another scream from his brother so he kept walking really faster to get where he was. Ravenholdm was nothing like the countrysides there was no birds singing and the pants were dead and teh dirt was messy and bloody from headcrabs.
When John Freeman got to where the screaming was started from he found his brother Gorden Freeman fightin the final bosss and Gordon said ""John Freeman! Over here!"" so John Freeman went there to where Gordon Freeman was fighting. John Freeman fired his bullet from teh gun really fast and the bullets went and shot the final boss in the eyes and the final boss couldnt see.
Gordon Freeman said ""its time to end this ones and for all!"" and punched the final boss in the face and the final boss fell. John Freeman said ""thanks i could help, bro"" and Gordon Freeman said ""you should come here earlier next time"" and they laughed.
The laughed overed quickly though because John Freeman yelled ""LOOK OUT BRO!"" and pointed up to the top of the sky. Gordon Freeman looked up and said ""NOO! John Freeman run out of here fast as you can!"" and John Freeman walked real fast out.
John Freeman loked back and saw Gordon get steppd on by the next boss and he was mad and angry.
""I'll get you back evil boss!"" John Freeman yelled at the top of lungs.
to be continued..?"
11164,This game might be old but with borderlands 3 aka the preqeul on the way it is fun to go back and play through this and BL2 to get ready for the release of the new borderlands !
11165,"This game is my new obsession.  I played the xbox360 version years ago and picked this up during a steam sale.  This PC version is much better than the console version.  This game, for me, is a cross between skyrim and call of duty.  Side missions are fun and looting all those chests is so much fun.  The single player experience is really fun but the game is better as a co-op experience.  Pick it up if you don't have it."
11166,"Great game, it really is an amazing game considering it's age! Can't wait to start play BL2"
11167,FPS combined with RPG-like qualities makes this super duper
11168,Amazing game. One of the best FPS RPG games I've ever played.
11169,I found bullets in a toilet. 5/5
11170,The game is very addicting.
11171,One of my favourite games. I love this
11172,"This is a game for people that like playing an FPS that is made for multiple players to cooperate towards a goal but don't mind going it solo either. It works just fine either way, but it can be hella fun when you have one of each type of character."
11173,"I have never been addicted to any game before. Borderlands changed all that thanks to my friend that bought it for me 5 years ago. She created a monster.......now ""get of my bus,"" its time to play!"
11174,"So much replayability, so many guns, so much loot"
11175,I love this game. lots of killing and loot. playing with friends is even better.
11176,This is a great game
11177,"Awsome gameplay, great maps and top of the best shooters"
11178,"A fantastic co-op FPS RPG.  It is one of the rare games where after completing the game, I went back and started over again.  It was simply a blast playing online with my buddies.  Every loot drop has you salivating for even more.  

I love the randomly generated weapons, but I do wish there had been a way to build your own weapons out of randomly generated components."
11179,"Completely awesome game, love running over the bad guys"
11180,Excellent adventure fps game that carries you in the cartoon and sarcastic worls of 2K.
11181,"nev, you're a faggot for not getting this game (╹◡╹)凸

Anyways, 5/5, would bang - co-op, replayability, a lot of loot, variety and it's a fairly long game."
11182,"- Claptraps
- Good jokes
- Weird looking enemies
- Sh.itloads of guns
- Lots of grenades
- Good DLCs
- Cartoon graphics
- LOOT!!!!

This game is truly a gem. You can spend tons of hours in it just looking for new/ better weapons or just play through the game again. It wont get booring as long as you follow the story or go to hunt some achievements. 
But not only in the singleplayer it's great. The part which is the most fun is the co-op. It combines teamwork and teamkilling. You'll love each other for reviving each other because dying due to enemies that are much weaker but got you down and you can't get a second wind because you're in any dumb corner isn't much fun at all. But you'll also hate your teammates because they sometimes get a better weapon than you or just steal your weapons. And then there are duels, duels are great to aquire satisfaction and honor for defeating your truly as.shole mates <3 

Even if the graphics might be bad (If you look at recent FPSs), it's not the only thing that matters. 
This game is fun in any way and I'd definitly recommend it to all my friends, which I already did."
11183,weird but fun to play
11184,"Some aspects are better than in the second game. The weapons look less like toy guns and more like actual guns. The random loot is more useful. The main story is way weaker, but I enjoy the DLCs more. Overall, if you want the ""hardcore"" loot-grinding-FPS gameplay, there is no reason to pick this over the second game, since it is superior regarding the core gameplay. But if you just wanna do some casual shooting n' looting on Pandora, this one is just as good, sometimes even better.
If you have a weaker computer, or a lesser budget, yet still want the ""borderlands vibe"", then this game is for all intents and purposes, the same as the second."
11185,Love This Game
11186,Awesome
11187,good game:D
11188,"Excellent art style, fun gameplay, and a very solid Coop experience. Grab a friend and enjoy the game. 9/10."
11189,I like guns. There are lot of guns. 10/10
11190,"Great game, totally recommended"
11191,Epic
11192,"Doesn't Save Progress, dont know what the game is about as I got in 40 minutes, took a break then found my save gone. Tried it again same thing."
11193,Really fun game if you are into open world quest type games. Its awesome with 4 people at once kicking but!!!
11194,"Addictive combination of FPS and RPG. Great graphic style. Hilarious sense of humor. All around, great game."
11195,"Gameplay:  18/30

Pros:
You get an ability
Sometimes satisfying combat
Better at the end

Cons:
Talent tree filled with passive choices
limited enemy selection
Mostly standard fighting
Random chance to miss
induces heavy yawns
Emphasis on random gameplay turned my sniper into a revolver wielding gunslinger with sniper passives

Visual and Environmental Design:  18/25

Pros:
Initial concept is great
Occasional cool set pieces
Surprisingly nice looking snow
Sometimes neat visual effects

Cons:
Limited Environmental variety
Limited Mob design

Presentation:  7/15

Pros:
Introduction to game sets high expectations

Cons:
Sloppy port
Bulky UI
Fails to live up to initial expectations
Horrible quests
Horrible text
Horrible story
Disruptive UI elements like healing
Not easy to trade items
Uses Gamespy

Sound: 6/10

Pros:
I liked hearing my rifle and revolver go off

Cons:
Many garbage sound effects, although one terrible vocal effect was entertaining

Music:  5/10

Pros:
Opening track

Cons:
I almost gave them a zero because I couldn't remember any of the music outside of the opening track and one other.  Most of the music is more like ambient noise, and should almost be considered sound instead of music.  The juxtaposition of the annoyingly colorful characters and the environment combined with the industrial tones creates strange dissonance.  When the game does add in a more prominent musical selection it's completely drowned out by the insanely loud combat noises.  This strategy is common in some games to create a ""movie effect,"" but it doesn't suit me.

Miscellaneous:  5/10

I had a strong interest in Borderlands early on because of the incorporation of the abilities with the shooter, and its bold visual design.  I passed up on it because of the repetition I heard plagued the game.  I ended up purchasing it rather cheaply because Borderlands 2 impresses me with its own gameplay elements. 

Unfortunately both aspects of the game let me down with only glimmers of what I expected from the title. 

I'm really happy that Borderlands, as a new IP, was successful for Gearbox, and I know some people absolutely love it, but Borderlands left me desperately wanting to finish and never play it again.  Additionally, it significantly dampered my interest in Borderlands 2.

I wanted to give this 6 Misc. points to bump it to a 60 because it's a new IP, but I looked at the games I've rated over time that scored a 60 and I enjoyed all of them more than I did Borderlands.  Borderlands becomes the 5th game I've scored to earn less than a 60.

Overall:

59/100"
11196,10/10 would loot again
11197,"Borderlands, Borderlands, Borderlands....where do I even begin?

I love this game. Like, a lot. It's honestly the first open world FPS RPG I've ever played, and WOW, this was a good game to start out on. Lemme stray from my empty reccomendations and give you a little rundown on what the heck this gem of a game is.
So, you're a Vault Hunter. You're hunting for the Vault (duh), a place rumored to have infinite fame, wealth, and power inside. You are on the planet Pandora, a desolate wasteland ridden with murderous bandits, bloodthirsty psychopaths, and many feral creatures hunting for their next meal. Shoot and loot your way through this unforgiving place, gaining trust by granting favors and completing bounties, saving some people's lives and taking many, many other. Trek across desolate, rugged terrain. Slaughter bandit after bandit, skag after skag, to get to the elusive Vault. From the Arid Badlands to New Haven to Sledge's Safehouse and the Crimson Enclave, cross this planet and pillage, murder, and....well, become what you destroy. Except you do it to the bad guys.

You will regret not buying this game. Especially with the DLCs, because they change the experience entirely. Coliseums, zombies, Robolutions, and more.

This, my friends, is Borderlands.

PS If you play this, and intent to play Borderlands 2 alongside at some point, either don't or skip the BL2 intro, because it has a spoiler in it. A pretty big spoiler.

Replayability: 5/10
Graphics: 6/10, but honestly, I don't care too much, considering my sub-par computer can actually RUN it with not too much lag.
Everything else: 20/10. Would run over midgets again."
11198,"One of the best shooters out their, a classic everyone should play at least once."
11199,"Tons of fun, plenty of opportunity to change up gameplay depending on equipment purchased/found and pairsed with certian skills."
11200,This is a fantastic game. Too bad no matter how many times I download it it still doesn't run correctly.
11201,"Really, really awesome game with great co-op!! This is probably my new favorite game series!! It's the perfect mix of FPS, RPG, and open world. It's incredible!"
11202,"After all these years, this game is easily still top of my list. Pick up the version with the DLC and grab a FOV mod, grab a couple of friends, get them on voicechat and enjoy a great night."
11203,"Time to replay it, fourth time ^.,,.^"
11204,"Lots of guns, lots of fun... enough said. Let's kick ass."
11205,"I love Borderland! This game is awesome. Each character is unique and a lot of fun to play. I found this game a little too easy at times on single player. I grinded out to try to complete all the achievements and the ones for the Clap Trap DLC were rediculously tedious. However, I still kept playing because it is a lot of fun."
11206,Psyco dick slayers
11207,so cool
11208,"Do you like role-playing games for their ""leveling"" and ""upgrading"" systems? Having a generic character class that you can then make your own through in-game options? Do you like shooting things? Do you like shooting a lot of things with a lot of different weapons? Do you like cel-shaded-esque graphics that never really ""age"" per se? Do you have friends? Do you like playing rpg-shooting games with friends cooperatively? Do you not have friends but you still love rpg-fps?

Boy have I got good news for you: Borderlands."
11209,This is a game.
11210,i am not very thrilled but i have to say it is a pretty good game although it lies in the shadow of the second game
11211,Shoot people get better guns and shoot more people. It's pretty dull but atleast you get to shoot people. If you like shooting people you should buy this. Did I mention you get to shoot people and use different guns to shoot people?
11212,Ooh money!
11213,Enjoyed so much I grew another ball. 11/10.
11214,"Fun game, you guys should get it"
11215,ah-may-zing!
11216,"What can you say about the original Borderlands that hasn't already been said? I remember when this first came out and I thought it looked weird and dumb. Well, it was weird...but holy god did it deliver on being one of the best shooters of all time. I remember hours upon hours of Craw runs trying to get the rarest weapons and shields. SOOO much fun, everyone should own this game!"
11217,"Picture a futuristic western environment on an alien planet... with copious amounts of guns, and special abilities, oh, and don't forget quests. A few of my friends were on board with Borderlands from the beginning, but I was skeptical and held back. I absolutely adore shooters like the Halo franchise and the Gears of War franchise, and I was very unsure about becoming involved in a game that appeared to be very wide open and lengthy. However, when I picked up the game and started it playing it, I was amazed. I couldn't put it down. I loved the characters, I loved the landscape and graphics, and I loved the guns, crazy amounts of smgs, snipers, pistols, repeaters, assault rifles. For those of you who think that it is maybe too large of a game, please reconsider. I consider every second played time well spent. BTW, the cooperative play is also inspired. Play with up to three additional friends. My only warning about playing with other people, however, is that if they have some missions completed that you haven't started yet, it might mess up a mission or two. Otherwise, grab a copy of Borderlands Game of the Year Edition, and join the treasure hunt on Pandora. It's not too late to play one of the greatest games of the decade."
11218,Juvenile humor without being childish.
11219,"Still haven't finished it but I am planning to.

Really fun with friends if you're a loot-driven person. The amount of guns is insane, sure the re-skins aren't anything to marvel at but it's the stats you're looking at anyway.

Ton of quests, ton of sidequests can eat up your time like you wouldn't believe. Great visuals, decent humor and quite fun gameplay.

Glad to have an FPS that shoot shoot for loot loot.

Still best recommended for CO-OP with some pals, solo can feel TOO lonely. Even for an introvert."
11220,Best Loot and shooter in my opinion definately pick this up Blast Master Brick forever baby
11221,crazy game.  too much fun to be had.
11222,"Love this game, building on an incredible first game. 9/10"
11223,"I couldn't stand this game. The humor was okay, the graphic style was okay, but I felt like I was playing world of warcraft in a desert with no friends.

4/10 my parents never loved me"
11224,Very good game
11225,Bazillions of guns!
11226,Great game combines first person shooting with rpg elements.  Lots of great humor spread throughout the game
11227,"Great game.....it changed alot on how to play a game
"
11228,Robot dance 20/10
11229,"I really enjoyed this game.  It's fun, engaging and enjoyable.  Plus the robot is cute!"
11230,400% more awesome!!!!
11231,"The game is worth getting cause you get  loot, cool characters the story is decent."
11232,"I've really enjoyed this game so far. You start out by jumping into combat pretty early on and the game has a really good pace to it. I think it was originally designed to be played as a mixture between solo and multi-player, but so far I've only played it alone and I've enjoyed the missions, storyline, and progression of my character.

My first thought of a game to compare this to would be Fallout 3. It has more of an FPS focus compared to FO3, and the world isn't open like FO3, but the combat is great and the whole game has a really good sense of humor that I've really enjoyed. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys FPS/RPG mixture."
11233,A boring mess of checking gun stats
11234,Great Game... Would definately recommend
11235,I love this game! Lots of replayability and great gameplay and story!
11236,I highly recommend this game. Even after beating it countless times I can still come back and have loads of fun with it. 10/10
11237,Must-have FPS Co-Op shooter. Loads of weapons prevent any occurrence of boredom from emerging! The co-op feature for up to four players make the game an excellent choice for gaming with friends.
11238,I heard this had aliens in it. I was not disapointed.
11239,"good game, much fun"
11240,This game is fucking amazing... has a very good storyline and it can run on fairly low spec computers
11241,Classes are fantastic and the story is great. Recomend for any FPS fans.
11242,Excellent Game
11243,"Great humor, love the characters. Great game all around."
11244,"Gameplay might not be as good as Borderlands 2, but I personally preferred the story and characters."
11245,despite its age its an amaizing game
11246,"Despite my Steam playtime on this I've played well over 100 hours of Borderlands and probably over 200 hours on Borderlands 2.  This game has it all violence, humour, sex (appeal) blood, guts and did I mention humour.  If you've not played Borderlands or know nothing of these games then you've been living in a cave and missng out on a special game series.

Play it enjoy it love it ! ! !"
11247,yea
11248,"Very lonely in singleplayer, its soo gray and far between locations, not a bad game though."
11249,good game..
11250,brown
11251,"Kind of the birth of a good FPS/RPG system that was perfected in its sequel, Borderlands 2.

If you have Blands 2, you're good. Blands 1 is great, but not essential.

11252,"""I'm getting really good at this!"""
11253,Good Adventure
11254,"Borderlands has to be one of my favourite games. I can sit and play this alone or with my friends.
It is a four player co op.

Borderlands is a RPG and kudos to 2K. This game plays brilliantly on PC and is so varied it is impossible to get bored.

You can choose one of four characters:
Roland: A soldier. His special skill is a turret, levelling up the turret means it can fire rockets and heal allies. The best guns to use are assault rifles. 
Mordecai: A hunter. His special skill is Bloodwing, his faithful pet bird who will swoop and kill enemies. You can level up Bloodwing so enemies drop more loot when killed. Best weapons to use are sniper rifles.
Lilith: A Siren. Her special skill is Phasewalking. Levelling up the skill means giving elemental damage when the skill ends. Best weapons to use are SMGs.
Brick: A Berserker. His special skill is punching. Yes. Punching. You can level it up to the point where one punch will smash the enemy to pieces. His best weapons are shotguns.

The main story is amazing and you will meet many allies and foes in your quest for the vault. You are guided by a mysterious woman who pops up on your echo feed now and again to point you in the right direction. You will also meet the infamous robot CL4P-TP or Claptrap. Annoying as he is you will find him querky and fun. During your quest you will come up against bosses. Nine toes is the first one and he is pretty easy to eliminate. The bosses get harder with each level as do the enemies. They level up with you as you get further in the game. However each area has different levels of enemies. Fyrestone has level 1-8 enemies so once you go past level 10 it is easy to kill them.

NPCs play a big part in this game in giving out quests. You also have bounty boards in which to pick up side missions. You will find a bounty board in pretty much every safe haven you find. Scooter pops up with his Catch a Ride machines, giving you cars to run around in. You will find vending machines all over Pandora. Ammo Dumps provided by Marcus Kincaid, replenish ammo and level up your gun types to hold more ammo. Dr Zed machines will heal you and you can buy shields and health kits.

Enemies on Pandora range from Skags to Bandits. There are a bazillion guns for you to find and use, each unique. Some fire explosives, some set fire to your enemies, other melt the enemies face off literally!! Grenade mods help you to have stronger grenades.

Once you have completed the main story you will be given a special mission. This mission calls for you to take three friends into the lair of Cramerax. A level 62, he is pretty much invincible until you are a level 69 and even then he is difficult. Prepare and make sure you are able to keep moving!! 

In short there is many a mission to keep you busy for hours on end. I give this game a full 10/10, it is just that good!!

Try not to die!!"
11255,If you have never played Borderlands before and you want to know if you should before playing the sequal the answer is yes and no. No because story wise it dosent tell you anything the 2nd game wont clarify. Yes because it will get you invested in the characters and give you a better feel of why Jack is badguy. All of that aside there really aint no rest for the wicked and i can back that claim up. Iv spent so many hours with this amazing FPSRPG that iv lost count. What it lacks in a deep intresting story it makes up for in fun 4-way co-op. The random gun generation means that no play through will be quit the same. The art style blends well with the gameplay and the game itself doesn't try so hard to be funny (like with the sequal). The gameplay can get a little repetative (it is an FPS after all) so its best not to play for very long at a time. The only real glaring issue with Borderlands are its legendary guns; the weapons that are ment to be top tier. Many of them have been codded incorrectly and dont behave as intended. This is a very minor oversight and really does nothing to take away from the game. It just messes with my OCD. Also hellfire is OP.
11256,"Picked this up on a sale and am very late to the party, but Borderlands holds up very well, despite the lack of multi-player support with the close of GameSpy. The graphical style endures and performs well even on older hardware. The game has clearly paved the way for Destiny and other loot-based/RPG-infused shooters."
11257,"I felt obligated to play this before getting into the sequel. The progression is solid and I enjoyed the comic-y story, although the General Knoxx & Moxxi Arena DLC wasn't worth the time it took to play through solo."
11258,Amazing game 20/10 Brings back old memories. All in All amazing game
11259,It's the tits. Buy this game and slap all your friends in the dick if they don't.
11260,Playing the game is just so awesome the missions are fun and its hard but not too hard and the story is just intresting. then the multiplayer holy shit i could spend 10000 of hours playing it with my friends :D buy it so worth it
11261,"Borderlands is fantastic. The dark humor is readily apparent from the start of the game all the way through the end of the first play through. The guns are outstanding, they feel and sound powerful, especially compared to the majority of guns in Borderlands 2. I enjoy the scenery and texture of the game, much different than the majority of games out there."
11262,"AMAZING game so far, I am level 26 and in New Haven. Although Borderlands 2 is definitely more developed and you can see where the money from this game came into play, but  this is still good if you want to discover more about the story. Having played Borderlands 2 FIRST, this game definitely was not AS fun and definitely didn't have the mechanics of BL2, but is still good, as stated before, for the plot."
11263,Definetly fun experience with about 50-100 hours of solid fun. Best served with coop.
11264,excellent game with plently of loot
11265,"Not a bad way to pass the time.  Fun controls, easy to get a handle on."
11266,"As someone who was introduced to the Borderlands games by playing the second one I must say that the original is rather gloomy. The second has many improvements, in gameplay, feel, and mood. While skipping to the second may  add some confusion as to why certain plot points are significant in BL2, I recommend it if you are looking to get into the Borderlands franchise."
11267,"It isn't working. I recommend this, but it isn't working for some reason."
11268,good all round game. gets a little boring with replay.
11269,Good.
11270,"Reminds me of my homeland, Pakistan! 10/10"
11271,Terrific game. Lots of humour and generally funny. Interesting game mechanics such as elemental weapons each with their own effects to kill enemies.
11272,"Borderlands is a lot of fun with friends or on your own. Lots of leveling up and a shed ton of guns. ALLOT OF GUNS. Full emphasis on that. Would recommend buying with Borderlands 2 And play it before Borderlands 2. Borderlands 1 has more of a feel you would get from the word ""borderlands"". Either way its a great game to play and normally goes pretty cheap."
11273,"I shot a midget in the face with a shotgun. 
10/10"
11274,"decent game with some good gunfights and tricky challenges, i'd recommend getting the GOTY Edition"
11275,Pretty damn good.  It's kind of sad that FPS has become so crap these days that roguelike elements are the only way to keep people invested in the genre but I guess that's where we're at these days so might as well run with it.
11276,"Amazing game! While Borderlands 2 has the edge on the first in terms of story and dynamics, Borderlands has some great aspects that the sequel lacks. The visuals and soundtrack combine for a realistic and unique atmosphere; while there are clever moments of humour littered throughout the game. One of the best parts is the multiplayer as you can play through the entire story (including side quests) with up to three friends. How cool, right?
Would totally recommend!"
11277,Freakin' love borderlands. Tenouddaten.
11278,"Excellente shooting game, and really fun to play!"
11279,its the shit
11280,tHIS iS A GoOD GAem
11281,This game is one of my favorite games of all time. The characters are all very well written and hilarious. I would definitely reccomend this game to any of my friends 10/10
11282,"Story - Pandora, a planet full of mysteries, and Bandits. You a Vault Hunter come to this planet seeking treasure and fame. Will you find it?

Pros - Nice graphics. HUD easy to understand. Easy controls. 4 classes with branching skills/levels. A long story. Hours of gameplay. Crude humor. Not too gory. Any one could play and understand. Playable. Decent Story. 

Cons - Minor bugs that are rare to fine, which all games will have. 

Personal Review - This game man. One of the best FPS's ive ever played. The beginning was kinda slow, but after that it turned into an amazing game! (Reguarding that the second one is even better.) You can play basicly any class and get through the story by yourself, just with diffrent classes take diffrent skills like it should. Mutiplayer is recommended because you experiance more though the game, gain more experiance through it, and makes the game tougher and harder to beat, which is awesome. Story was a little eh. Could use some work with that, but that doesnt stop it from being an amazing FPS and an amazing game.

I highly reccomend this game if you love shooting s***, love a kickass game, and love branching skills. 9/10"
11283,Hours of fun and adventure for everyone. A must buy. Stop everything and go shoot some Psychos in the face.
11284,"Funny, violent, addictive, and sometimes down right silly. Borderlands is awesome and you should play it."
11285,One of the best questing first person shooters out there!
11286,You don't have to be brilliant at FPSes to get on with this game. Thank goodness...
11287,"graphics are awful, bad game in general"
11288,"Great game. Missing a mini-map, though... :("

11291,"Extremamente divertido. A trama é bem complexa e cheia de detalhes escondidos nas missões secundárias. A jogabilidade data de seu lançamento (2009), porém, é muito funcional, simples e intuitiva. As classes, [i]perks[/i] e armas diferem incrivelmente uns dos outros, tornando as possibilidades de build exponenciais. O visual não surpreende, mas, por basear-se em [i]Cel-Shading[/i] continua agradável."
11292,Dlcc de jogo cara
11293,"Best played in co-op with a friend or three, but probably fun alone. It's a FPS that plays like an RPG. Or is it the other way around? Get loot, build your character up, and enjoy the cell-shaded art style. Every major DLC release is worth getting (do yourself a favor and get the GOTY edition). The cost-to-fun ratio makes this buy a no-brainer, as you'll spend countless hours playing this - with DLC, you're looking at 50+ hours per playthrough, and trust me, you'll likely be playing through again to level further. Yes, there are moments of tedious grinding, but all-in-all, you can't go wrong with this game.

10/10"
11294,"GAME OF THE YEAR, EVERY YEAR! RECCOMENDED FOR ALL PLAYERS! THIS REVIEW IS NOW OGRE>("
11295,"Epic game with epic characters. The world is immersive and fun. It was dangerous, but not overly so, giving the perfect amount of challenge. My bf and I didnt think we were going to like the art style but this game really pulls it off. Funny moments were funny, serious moments were serious. The amount of guns, OHMAHGAWD, the guns. Guns everywhere, too many guns. Had to use the dlc so I could store all my guns. Had to create extra characters and fully level them so I could store more of my guns. Why did I need that many guns? IDK, I just did."
11296,Really fun game and its kinda like an RPG/FPS. Its awesome!
11297,Has no border
11298,"Infinite respawning enemies is the worst thing ever!
Also vehicle controls are mad. WHO DID MAKE THIS?!
Graphics and story are good but infinite enemies make this game really boring."
11299,"One of the best games I've played and I've sunk many hours into it. It's also holds a lot of replay value. Tons of customizations and of course, the amount of weapons in here are insane. Highly reccommended for an FPS and it has a pretty fun storyline."
11300,"It's alot of fun, alot more fun with friends."
11301,"The Borderlands series must be one of the best FPS+RPG I've ever played. This was the game that truly got me into gaming. For being an older game, the graphics are still beautiful and the cell shading style was done wonderfully. If youve played Borderlands 2 first, youll see that the UI is a little different and some of the physics; but overall an amazing game!"
11302,"hours of fun, amazing classes, millions of guns i definitely reccomend this game"
11303,"lots of fun
definitely reccomended"

11310,"I spent most of my 2013 summer playing this and I have to admit. This was one of those games where I could sit for hours on end just playing. Shoot things, pick up weapons and then spend 30 minutes oohing and ahhing over which weapon was better. That is probably the downside, there is a lot of choice for weapons and a lot of time is spent on your inventory. Only to realise you accidentally sold a gun that you really needed (but that is just me being clumsy with my items.)
Definitely worth playing, again and again, and again. I'm currently going through my second walkthrough at the moment. Then, I will be getting on to making sure this is another game where I have all the achievements going. 
If you are going to buy this. DO"
11311,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
11312,"Shoot N Loot FPS HEAVEN! Borderlands is a game that stands out from the crowd of otherwise bland and boring shooters by incorporating elements of RPGs and popular culture for an all out in your face blast of pure AWESOME. If you are looking for the ultimate multiplayer game with longevity or just a really fun and varied shooter that ticks all of the boxes you didn't even realise were there, then look no further Borderlands is your next stop. Prepare to pump MANY hours into Pandora ;D"
11313,Great game but does not run well i can't play it on my pc i don't reccomend it if you can't play a game you bought thats no game i want so be sure it works before you get it. i hope better for furture Borderlands series

Great game!"
11319,"A Review Mostly for me so I know I’ve completed the story, as well as feedback on the game.
 
My Thoughts:-  GUNS! GUNS! GUNS! Loads of em good game for a FPS RPG type game, up to 4 player co-op.

Achievements:- 80 of 80 (100%) Achievements Earned

Graphics:- Bit cartoonish but alright you can see the console graphics in this game tho.

Story:- you’re on a bus after a vault and are contacted by Angel that helps you find and open the vault but the treasure in the vault aint what the vault hunters expect.

Replayability:- with 4 characters and 2 play troughs for each can be quite repayable. 

What Could Be Added: better Pc graphic options

Rating:- 8 / 10
"
11320,"OMG best series ever. Such a good story line and controls are amazing. Great controller support! Needs VSync and better AntiAliasing.  Needed more Crimson Lance though. Story isn't as powerful as Borderlands 2. overall 8/10 

I wish they included General Knoxx's secret army because of its being part of the Borderlands 2 storyline. 

Just be sure to get General Knoxx and Moxxi Thunderdome if you want to understand Borderlands 2 FULLY. Moxxi's Thunderdome isn't nearly as important."
11321,"Amazingly fun and addictive game, not as good as Borderlands 2 but very similiar and still fun with friends."
11322,borderlan :)
11323,"When you jump, you grunt.

11324,"Epic, just epic all out crazy! The graphics are one-of-a-kind and add to the insane vibe that just radiates from my monitor every time I start playing it. The controls aren't clunky and the whole thing about having a bazillion generated guns in the game always makes me happy."
11325,trdfhdfgh
11326,The loot and fun i have on all the BL games are amaizing . Im ready for Pre-Sequal bring on the midgets :P
11327,"Borderlands is one of my alltime favourite games! I probably have 500hrs on the xbox.
This game can be great fun by yourself. But I suggest getting a buddy.. You work to get sick loot and kill cool enemys in a open world. This game is not linear in anyway, You have tonnes of side quests to do and places to explore. 
Every gun is different, Besides quest guns. But they're different in small aspects.

10/10 If you like shooters and killing monsters a such and cool cartoony effects.. etc.. I'd suggest this to you.

Summary:
Graphics arn't detailed. But it isn't suppose to. It's like a cartoon almost. Hard to explain.
Gameplay is Awesome, Guns that shoot elements. Halarious jokes.
Multiplayer is good, Nothing to complain about.
There is so much to do!, and once you think you've done it all. Move to Borderlands 2! xD"
11328,"This is the best ""Shoot and Loot"" game out there, and for good reason too, there are at least a million different weapons out there to find."
11329,i hate borderlands 2
11330,"FPS action with an RPG twist.

The story does well to deliver an original and interesting plot with diverse and likeable characters while also delivering some nice humour to the mix. With four playable character classes to choose from you can select a character with skills that suit your play style and if you choose to play through again you can try out the other characters for a new experience.

The guns? The enemies? Yeah there's heaps of both of them. Too many guns to count and a range of elemental and other effects and stats that make each weapon have their own advantages. The loot is definitely a big part of this game, finding big containers full of weapons, grenades and shields that are more powerful than any you have seen before is very rewarding; it's even more rewarding when you beat your friend to the loot and then brag about how good your new guns are. You can always share too but where's the fun in that?

There are vehicles which handle well and allow you to take out enemies with the mounted machine guns. There's nothing really wrong with them and they do help to traverse large distances more easily but overall they're not as much fun to use when you have such a great arsenal at your disposal already.

Each character class has their own special ability and unique skill tree to increase your power and abilities as you level up from doing missions and killing enemies. These different abilities complement each other well in co op allowing players to take out enemies more efficiently if they use their abilities right; enemies will adjust to your level too so if you're playing co op you'll get more difficult enemies to balance things out.

Overall this game offers a whole lot of content and the choice of different character classes gives you additional replay-ability. Definitely worth a buy."
11331,"The cartoonish style of Borderlands might be a minus for some, but Gearbox uses that to implement a particular gore style and a buttload of humour. 

Best Features: 
 - Loot, loot again and some more loot there.
 - Leveling. Even though it is a FPS, the leveling system let you play four different characters with each three different talent trees. 
 - Humour. The humour in this game is genius. Shooting to death a bandit at point blank with a sniper and stumbling across his arm a few feet farther is always nice in that kind of game. Plus the CL4P-TP robot makes me think of the hyperactive child GLADOS would have had if she could have one.
 - It plays well in solo and great in co-op. The game stays the same and you have many hours of gameplay. Took me around 40 hours my first time with a little try of every character and some fooling around. 

Minus :
 - It is kind of an open world but you can't really venture off to the high level zone if you're not yourself high level. The trash mobs will kill you pretty fast. 
 - Community is greedy. If you play in a quick match online, you might have to fight for the loot. 
 - PvP is not really insane in Borderlands. Though I had my fun on PS3 killing those hacked-shield wielder in the small arena in the first zone."

11348,"This is seriously one of my favorite games ever. Take the frantic gunplay from shooters like Call of Duty, the RPG mechanics of the Diablo franchise, the visuals of your average comic book, and the personality (and wit) of a Valve game, and you get something pretty close to Borderlands. Choose one of 4 unique and equally awesome classes, and play through a 25+ hour story packed to the brim with action, humor, and guns (hnnnng the guns). If you weren't already aware, Borderlands is known for having hundreds of thousands of different possible guns to find and blast people with. You can have a dinky, little pistol in one moment, and find a legendary rocket launcher that fires mulitplying rockets that electrocute people in the next. Half of the reason why this game is so damn fun is the feeling of not knowing what you can find next. As someone who has played 2+ playthroughs with each class and got them all to the maximum level, I will never get tired of playing Borderlands. Pick it up, and bring a friend or three if you can. The game gets exponentially more fun when you play it co-op with friends."
11349,"Guns + Guns = A lot of fucking guns

11350,"I have to revise my previously positive-ish review. 

Great game if you enjoy the cel shaded art style and loot drop style... and hate your life, and don't mind grinding in a video game for  half of it. 

DIFFICULTY SPIKES!!!!!!! This isn't a pay to win, why the massives spikes? To prolong gameplay... in the wrong way? I shouldn't be able to breeze through one section with absolutely no threat, and then be brutally murdered within under 15 seconds. Seriously, I get it, you want me to grind, but come on, mandatory grinding on way under-leveled characters to progress is just POOR GAME DEVELOPMENT.  It's your fault, not ours. Stop taking out your lack of creativity on the gamers. 

Maybe Borderlands 2 is better. I don't know, and I won't judge on something I don't know. I just wish I had a time machine so I could slap the shit out of the Borderlands developers before they released this."
11351,"EDIT: Now that Valve has made servers for Borderlands online play, I have decided to change my review of this game from negative to positive.

While many may consider it an instant classic, having played Borderlands 2 before the first one, my expectations were much higher. In Borderlands, you play as an errand boy. You run around doing whatever you're told to and in exchange recieve just enough XP and money to survive in the game. Useful items are scarce, the little story the game features is dry, bosses are boring, the entire world lacks color and character balance is non-existant. Having loved her in the sequel, Lilith was the first character I chose and every mission was a drag with her. The other three choices were fun to use, but Lilith is just so useless, she even has abilities that screw you over (one of them makes you leave a trail of fire behind you, which seems great until you realize how many explosive barrels you walk by). Rather than being the hero Pandora has been dying for, you're forced to do everyone's chores in the world's greatest drive-here-do-this-shoot-that-collect-this-talk-to-him-find-this-walk-here game for PC. There aren't even servers availble for multiplayer, since Game Spy decided to quit unexpectedly. The only reason I had bought this game was to play with friends, because I know how dull Borderlands is single-player. 

I wouldn't call Borderlands 1 a bad game, but it has flaws. Luckily, the game's problems were all fixed in the sequel. If you're a die-hard Borderlands fan, I'd suggest getting this, but if you're new to the series start with Borderlands 2."

11357,"What can i say about Borderlands??? IT""S BORING!!! That is unti it gets really good!!! Really, this game does get realy good but you'll have to wait for a cuple of hours. Level up your character and watch how the game gets better and better. The game has lots of funny Dialogue and the story line is good, but you'll have to listen to what they're saying so... Achtung!!! (pay attention), and your Vigilance shall be rewarded: but not that much. Realy, there are a lot of boring level up quests at the start to get you Familiarized with the game, which  i  thought realy didn't need to be there, but once you start on the main story line things get a lot more fun. Especially when your character is sufficiently leveled up so you can mow down enemys in a Challenging fashion. 
Guns.
Lots and Lots of GUNS!!!
Did i mentioned that?
There are a crazy amount of unlimited guns!!! 
And they rain down from the sky like water falling from the vault of heaven. MUHAHAHAHAHHAHahahahahahaaaaaaaaa.
So have fun and remember to lode your weapon.

I am however trading a spare copy of Borderlands GOTY for a copy of The Forest, which goes for $15, lemme know if you want to trade!"
11364,"Great Team Co-op Play, replayability, complexity, and ease of drop-on carnage."
11365,borderlands is the perfect crossover of mario graphics and final fantasy gameplay. its good
11366,Honestly i didn't care for it but if you like the comicy style and somewhat monotonous gameplay with a story too simple to impress a 2 year old i guess it might be for you.
11367,"Have to say I feel like im in something of a minority here, but once I got used to the interesting, unique graphics I really didnt find much to like about this game. THe story (what there was) was catching and dropped hints of bigger stories... but ultimately came up underdeveloped. Another example as well, starts as a positive: with having a good cast of so many interesting charecters is a great boon to any game, underutilization just makes it all the more glaring when you dont deliver. And that sort of sums up my experience with Borderlands, promises but doesnt quite deliver. Upgrading weapons was interesting, as was skilling-up, but never got me hooked the way Diablo 2 or 3, or even torchlight could.

This has been reviewed as a solo experience, and I honestly believe that the game would be 10x better with friends. That being said, if its this dull in single player... why not make it multiplayer exclusive?

Worth a single run though, if bored, and if you are looking for something with a lot of promise that falls short on the delivery. 

2.5/5."

11372,"Amazing game 
"
11373,All I have to say is PLAY IT!!! Basically a casual shooter RPG. This game can get you addicted at the first mission. Some of the features are a little wonky but working as intended. You will definately enjoy playing this game. It also has really good replay ability.
11374,"I like it. Very good. 





5/5 Wubs"
11375,Buy the GOTY edition and get a few friends for a full playthrough! Then grab borderlands 2 GOTY and do the same thing! Then wait for the pre-sequel and do it all again!
11376,"Anyone who hasn't played this should remedy that, right now."
11377,"very fun in singleplayer or multiplayer. unlike in 2, where the bosses will clobber a singleplayer with ease and then go back to full health, this game is more forgiving."
11378,"First off, the multiplayer uses GameSpy, and GameSpy's dead, so unless you want to fake up a ""local LAN game"" with a VPN and people you already know, it's probably going to be a single-player experience, which is a bit of a shame.

By that token, this game feels almost the opposite of its successor (which seemed like a brotastic mess of forced jokes aimed at the tea party clientele -- but with rather workable co-op play): BL1 is played comparatively straight (so you're spared a lot of misfiring ""gags""); the story ""thinks smaller"", the locations are less varied, and there are fewer voiced lines -- but that's a bit of a blessing in disguise. More voiced lines in BL2 also mean Jack and Claptrap constantly spouting hideously unfunny rubbish, and the varied locations mean that after the shiny city of Opportunity, it's really unfun to go back to all the drab ones (worst of all perhaps Sawtooth Cauldron, which also happens to be a really annoying detour just when you think you're about to wrap up the main quest). Additionally, there are skills for the individual gun classes (SMG, sniper rifle, revolver, etc.) which improve with use, but guns you have a good skill rating for will last you a good while, and drops are fair enough (where BL2 made many feel like after 3 levels at most, they had to replace their guns, and since drops weren't spectacular, much of the gameplay consisted of mind-numbing, rote farming). 

The one thing I'll say for BL2 is that for most of the game, Maya's siren skills are more useful than Lilith's (the latter basically has the perk of ""running away really fast"" for most of the game; it seems to take a good amount of leveling up before her action skill has much worth in an offensive capacity). Coversely one thing I'll say for BL1 is, there are a lot of claptraps in there, and they're mostly not annoying, which is probably impossible to believe if you've only played the second game. :)

On balance, I came away from BL1 thinking I had some fun though the story didn't exactly feel epic or grand-scale, where with BL2, I had a lot of misgivings. Where BL2 seems too flawed to recommend, BL1 is rarely annoying, but also more muted where it succeeds; it's OK, but nothing to write home about.

All in all, GearBox seem like a bunch of amateurs who learn as they go along. From BL1 to BL2 they learned making the story bigger and ""cooler""; maybe from BL2 to BL3, they'll learn how to be funny (or at least not to force it if funny isn't their thing). Or maybe, player character claptraps will make the experience COMPLETELY insufferable."
11379,amazing
11380,"Borderlands.. 

This was a game that me and my friends enjoyed playing with each other. 

It had a fun coopy (yes I just made a new word.) feel to it that made it fun to play with friends. When not with friends.. Spam E when the weapon chest opens because otherwise you get nothing o_o

They added a few unique elements to the game that were actually pretty interesting. One of these was the weapon generation. Randomizing scripts would give weapons random stats meaning you could always find something better.. Unless if you found the smg that shoots incendiary rounds... Then... You could kill pretty much anything.. Which leads me to a problem with the game..

New Players.. Playing with friends is fun.. but we found that having weapons that could nearly one hit bosses took the fun away from the new players.. A fix for this could have been level/weapon scaling but alittle late for that now.

All of this being said though... I can't recommend this game to my friends.. They have updated their EULA giving them rights to collect what ever information off your computer that they want. So.. I leave the rest to you to decide if you want to willing install spyware on your computer.

11381,Great Game
11382,Had tons of fun with it really good graphich and gameplay
11383,"I'm having an absolute blast playing Borderlands. It's fun as hell, and hilarious as all get out. So much so that I can't put it down. (I may have taken a day off work this week just to play - don't look at me like that!) I can't wait to finish up so I can get back to Borderlands 2 (which I actually started first before coming back to play this one). Gotta get them done before the Presequel and Tales... come out! :)"
11384,"Although some QoLs that BL2 implemented aren't here obviously, this still stands up pretty solid on it's own. A lot of the areas feel the same until you hit DLC or you get later in the game (last couple areas).

Pretty good though!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've played both this game and the sequel on ps3 and xbox 360, but playing it on the pc tends to help with any lag issues you may experience. I also personally prefer this game on pc, but the console version for the sequel, as it just eliminates any past borderlands save issues.
Pros: Pretty long game with all the add ons, relatively ccheap if you grab GOTY edition, runs pretty easily, even on older computers.
Cons: Can lag on a console, or in big picture mode. Tends to have issues with 360 controller drivers at times on PC"

11398,"A couple of years down the line... this is totally not worth it unless you have some friends who specifically want to sit down and play it. Otherwise, it will sit in your backlog for years and years taunting you, until finally you find one single person to co-op through the game with. As soon as you begin playing, you'll realize why it's impossible to find anyone to play with. But, hell, you spent $7.50 on it a few years ago, and you have to play it eventually, right?"
11399,VERY GOOD GAME!!
11400,Play it

Though the levels  felt empty like fallout if you didn't had any friends playing the game with you.
The dlc's were fun to play, they included more guns, quests and a raid boss that you could beat with or without you're friends.
The game really shines in the co-op, so bring a friend and search for the vault

EDIT: the DLCs are sometimes very glitchy and buggy....and not in a good way!"
11410,"I loved it!!!!!!!!!! awesome game
"
11411,"I started playing this on my Mac and it was one of the best and funnest games i have ever played next to Bioshock 1.

You can play as either Brick, Mordecai, Lilth or Roland in the First installment of Borderlands. I usually choose Roland cause he can through down a turret that is really helpful when you are getting overwhelmed.

There are a TON of different guns you can find, loot and buy in the game. What i have noticed is that legendaries tend to drop more often in BL1 then in BL2 especially in the Weapon Machines. 

The one bad thing about the game is the General Knoxx DLC has a bug in the Lockdown Palace where my frames drop and the game randomly freezes. If i could find a solution to that it would be wonderful cause thats the only DLC i cant complete due to a game breaking Bug.

Also since GamsSpy is shutting down at the end of May, 2K is moving BL1 Multiplayer to Steam Servers so the Multiplayer will be saved.

Other than that I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone.

11417,"Not as good as Borderlands 2. That being said I'm not a super-fan of Borderlands 2 anyway, so my opinion doesn't mean much here. I think the first is different enough that I'm not sure that those that started with 2 will enjoy it. That being said, it's nice enough. The worst thing about it is no FOV slider, which is vomit fodder for many at the default ~70. It can be changed, but only by adding a line to a config file and binding that command to a key. Not ideal.

Buy it on sale and see if it feels good to you."
11418,"Borderlands is a game series which deserves tenfold more credit than it is currently getting. This game is a cross between Fallout and Call Of Duty. Has the gameplay of a game like Skyrim/Fallout BUT it has this one amazing feature that those games don't have; Co-Op Campaign. This allows a team of up to 4 friends, or you with 3 random people, to roam around and unleash havoc on the planet of Pandora.
Experiment with different equipment types, learn their traits and develop your character's skill in this amazing RPG first person shooter game.
I HIGHLY reccomend all the Borderlands games, and their DLC's as it just increases the long-lasting play time and extra content to keep the story flowing."

11426,"Great game though I am upset with the lack of support from steam. The loss of Gamespy/online multiplayer should be well marked on every product Steam is still making a profit from.

Here is a list of games that steam did NOT properly mark that have lost online support: (that i own)
-Dungeon siege 1 and 2
-Battlefront 2
-Borderlands
-Will Titan Quest be added to this list since it is powered by gamespy???

With tunngle and hamachi, it is possible to get around this though it is not what i paid for... 

Shame on you Steam"

11434,"Although the game took me awhile to get into because of how different it is from Borderlands 2, it's a lot of fun. Gameplay and story and good but it just seems a little slower then Borderlands 2. Although I played this game after the second game came out, its still a good game and a great buy. Shoot, loot, and repeat! Have fun!"
11435,"The great features of this game include hilarious dialogue from human enemies, non-enemies, and clap-trap robots, as well as a seemingly endless combination of weaponry with different abilities.  Your characters are more-or-less customizable to your game-play style (provided you pick the right character) and with the DLC's there are hours upon hours of play time to be had.  Also, unlike many other games where if you die you have to go back to the last savepoint, in this game you have a chance to save yourself.  Should you be downed by enemies, simply kill one during the ""fight for your life"" event and you get back up and can continue.  Should you actually die, you simply respawn after paying a sum of money at a NEW-U station and continue the fight!

The not so great features are that the game gets REALLY repetitive as far as enemies and quests go.  After 2-3 hours of gameplay, I find myself having to do something else due to the mind-numbing repetitiveness of the game.  Also, the only way to get anywhere is to do it quickly, so those who prefer to sneak around and kill slowly and methodically are going to have a problem.  The enemies respawn rather quickly, so even if you go quickly through the quest areas you will be fighting enemies both on your way there and on your way back out.  Lastly, the vehicles are not balanced once you enter the second play-through.  This means that while you usually are at a level that can easily handle everything you come accross for quite some time, they can easily destroy your vehicle and consequently put you into an instant ""fight for your life"" event.

Overall I still enjoy this game after the countless hours I have spent playing it.  I would reccommend this game for anyone who enjoys a good old-fashioned FPS game with an RPG twist."
11436,"Great game, lots of hours of fun!"
11437,"Really amazing game with an amazing way of playing it, my favorite part is the open world and the weapon hunting 10/10!"
11438,"The gunplay in Borderlands stands as some seriously well done shooting mechanics. The game as a whole is not as impressive as it is fun. With the lack of a decent ending, crappy RNG gun generation and lame enemy pathing (hey, at least they take cover) it stops Borderlands from being as fun as it could have been. I wanted to rate this game a little lower, but for some reason FPSs are hit and miss now for non-clunky gun mechanics which makes Borderlands better than some more recent shooters. I liked the RPG aproach they took as well. All things aside, while it may not have been the most amazing thing since sliced pizza, it did make me want to at least try the sequel. That’s got to count for something, right?

11440,love this game so much it works on outdated computers as well so it is perfect for me at the moment
11441,I'm so in love with this @.@
11442,"Just an incredible game all around. I never could get enough of it, and I doubt I ever will. Its one of those games that you can sit down and play for hours on end until you get the erge to play a different genre of games. If you are looking for a good game to play and stick with because you are bored, do not hesitate to get this game. Also, ALL the DLCs included in the GOTY edition are phenomenal. They all have a unique story and world that they are set in (except for Mad Moxxi's UR. Thats just an arena hoard mode. Still fun though...) 
I also would recomend the second game although as usual, the sequal wasnt as good as the original, still, it is a great, great game. Now with the completion of the PC version, I have complete it on Ps3, Xbox, an PC! :D 
This is one of my absolute FAVORITE franchises, and I can't wait to see what Gearbox does in the future days!"
11443,its garbage.
11444,"great game, buy it"
11445,Hell Yes!
11446,"This game is brilliant! Custom guns that have randomized stats, 4 amazing class/charecters to choose from with a good skill tree and then the story is pretty big. (with a second play through making things hard, yeah, i'd say this game is huge) :) 9/10 rating dude, it's funny and adventurous! if you haven't got i highly recommend if you like rpg's, fps' and a good laugh."
11447,"Been playing this game on multiple platforms since 2009, This game may not be perfect, but it sure is addicting and fun as hell to play through alone or with friends. Just trying to get the very best equipment is fun and addicting. I still have yet to find an Pearls across my 10 characters, but the search for one is one of the many aspects that this game has me coming back to play again and again! I highly recommend this game over the sequel if you prefer more challenge and more mechanics to loot. If you do get this game, I BEG OF YOU, to look at the mods and engine configurations because this game is abysmal for us PC elitists, but it can be made playable with some minor tweaks.

If you have friends, this is a must have to play."
11448,"First off, Borderlands is one of the best FPS games ever released.  There have been literally hundreds of thousands of words written about Borderlands since it was first released, it's that kind of game.  Without question it made a huge impact on the gaming landscape, not just when it was released but for years to come.

So why is this game so great?  Simply put, it combines several popular game mechanics, many not seen in FPS form before, into one fun, easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master package.  While the concepts themselves may not be truly original - alien wasteland setting, tongue-in-cheek humor, part-based randomized loot, multiple player classes with a level-based skill tree, 4-player co-operative gameplay - they'd never been combined together in one FPS.  Atop that, 4-player co-op during the main campaign was something that hadn't been seen in an FPS since the days of Duke Nukem 3D, back in the era of dial-up when such things were rather complicated to arrange.  Borderlands not only reminded people about 4-player co-op, it reminded them that it could be really, really good in an FPS.

Beyond that, Borderlands takes some of the core concepts of hack-and-slash games like Diablo and shows that those same concepts work great for FPSes.  +1 Sword of Smiting?  Why not an x4 SMG of Why Bother Aiming Its Basically A Shotgun?  Magic spells?  Call them action skills, and maybe add some explosions.  Elemental attacks?  Eh, who hasn't thought guns would be cooler with fire added?  Sure, instead of hack-and-slash it's shoot-and-loot, but at the core its the same thing: fun, in a randomized way.

There are of course a few little missteps here and there, things that Gearbox didn't nail down quite as perfectly as the rest of the game.  The somewhat lax scaling of enemies, the sparseness of fast travel stations in some areas, the utter uselessness of many weapons if given the wrong parts, how easily co-op partners can completely miss the plot if rushed.  All comparatively minor, but they're there (and, impressively, fixed in the sequel).  That said, it's a drop in the bucket, detracting in only the smallest of ways from an overall excellent game.

Borderlands is another milestone in gaming, the prototype for a new formula of FPS that looks to continue on for years to come.  To say it is a good game would be an understatement."
11449,Best and most fun game ever created 10/10
11450,"If like me, you like FPS (Gears, Halo)  but find most FPS games now are  getting boring (and short!) and full blown RPG games are not really your thing (too slow), then I think you'll love this. The storyline is great, there is loads to do, collect, level etc but you still get to shoot the shit out of stuff as well. What more can you want out of a video game. 
I am finding that this type of game (Bioshock, Borderlands, Tomb raider, Far Cry etc) give an immense reward for very little outlay, are great value for money and just great fun. For me I dont like the hack and slash game mechanic, but love guns and shooting shit, so these are all top class and above all FUN!!!"
11451,Found this game extremely fun to play (multiplayer playthrough). In all honestly I found this game a lot more enjoyable than Borderlands 2 as the storyline / tasks are really fun to play - especially in multiplayer. I'd give this game 9/10 - if you're into comedies and shooters then this game is perfect for youuuu!
11452,"Really fun with friends, not so much solo at least not to the extent that 2 fixed

Still pretty solid the graphics hold up and the guns are just as plentiful, just make sure you have friends to play with."
11453,"This, since Portal, has become my favorite video game. I love the style of the art, the gameplay, and the attitude it gives! There is nothing like the Borderlands series and I doubt there ever will be again :) great games! 2 thumbs up!!!"
11454,me gamesta
11455,"GOOD GAME. ROAR! SHOOT MUTANTS, GET STUFF!"
11456,Bang.
11457,"Shoot, loot, and show how BADASS you are!"
11458,"An excellent blend of RPG and FPS elements in a game that constantly refuses to take itself too seriously. Lots of fun as either a single-player or multiplayer game with pretty seamless transition, campaign-wise. I had low expectations and came away very, very impressed. The amount of content is also quite large, especially for an action FPS/RPG, so there's plenty of hours of fun to be had. Looking forward to playing the second! 9/10."
11459,butts 0.5/10
11460,Randomized loot and lots of entertaining dialogue.
11461,"I started my adventure with Borderlands 2, when friends convinced me to get it on sale, despite my hesitation. Since I generally dislike shooters and I'm not that good I didn't expect to like it. Eventually, though, I got to play way too much, and definitely the game is on my favorites list. Then I wanted to know more about the NPCs - the playable characters in the first game. I heard a lot about how Borderlands 1 is a great game, and that some of my friend were tired of playing Borderlands 2 because it's all the same. I also heard Borderlands is better on a PC than on a console. So I had my expectations high. But I only ended up disappointed... 
Technically, it's probably not good to compare older game against newer. However, with bunch of franchises people say they prefered the older games in the series. I've always wondered to what extent it's actually nostalgia speaking.

In case of Borderlands it seems pretty simple. Both games are funny, certainly, but I'd say Borderlands 2 wins in this regard a bit. However, the first games had more interesting and meaningful characters. (On the other hand Maya's ability seem more practical than Lilith's).

I've played a lot of Borderlands 2 and I got used to mechanisms in that game, I was surprised they weren't there in Borderlands 1. For example the inventory in Borderlands 1 is much more confusing, comparing is not as simple and clear. However, the absolutely BIGGEST problem with the first game is loot, and loot levels. My character is now level 25, I'm doing story missions and side quests appropriate for my level, and I get level 13 drops... What's wrong? It seems like loot levels are totally random. My weapons are extremely weak, because they are at least 5 levels below my character's level, there's nothing good for purchase in the machines. The only place that has any chance of giving something more appropriate are the big treasure chests. They usually give loot for too high level though. It's just terribly poorly-balanced...

Another problem I found is the map. The game says it has partial controller support, but the controller seems to work basically everywhere, except for the map. But even with the mouse, viewing the map is extremely awkward, having to zoom out every time you need to find your objective, and the movement is just quite unnatural to me.

And then one more thing is that, in comparison to Borderlands 2, you have to pick up money and ammo drops manually, instead of just running into them. It never really bothered me much, though, so I don't find it particularly problematic. And it's also something that I can totally forgive an older game for not implementing.

The rest of the things are on the same level in both games, and that is really good level. Borderlands is still vey very enjoyable game, totally worth recommending. But if, like me, you started with Borderlands 2 and go down to Borderlands 1 expect fall damage, also as it is in the game itself."
11462,"Bought this game randomly in highschool, played the shit out of it for two years on xbox 360... couldnt have been more excited to finally get it on steam"
11463,Very enjoyable. Liked it.
11464,Nice game!!!
11465,Well I'm not much for compliments but -- this game is fine. Many genres are much more interesting when there's RPG elements involved and this goofy humor FPS is not an exception. AI is occasionally hilariously bad. Character levels affect weapon damage which forces the player to do some quests or farm mobs. Even two level difference between the player and the mobs can be too much. This prevented me from continuing the plot the way I wanted. I probably would've praised this game more if I hadn't played games like Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas.
11466,Loot fest! Overpowered guns! Fun! 8/10
11467,such fun game. not take anything serious. cute innuendos. not for faint of hert. if seek you violence and zany action and shooter in the first persons borderlands is this game for you mang. shooting and driving and questing and buying and selling with four different characters. plus npc's make great memories for family gatherings and when you take date to applebees. all in all this game can i guarantee you play for over 20 hours. really do.
11468,"A VERY fun game to play co-op with a few friends. It's a shame they shut down the servers, but LAN still works. I beat the game probably five or six times, it's still a blast to play!"
11469,"I thought this game was going to be about stopping illegal immigrants from hopping over the border. I thought this game puts you in the middle of the action between the U.S. and Mexico and you got to choose sides to help as you venture into the Border-Land. However, it was some cartoon game."
11470,"Borderlands is for people who enjoy the extreme tedium of Diablo-style hack n' slash games' ""kill, loot, equip better gear, sell the rest, repeat until you get a game over screen,"" but want it in a very simplistic FPS format. The only things that add variety are the selection of characters, each of whom has a single unique ability that becomes incredibly boring to use after you realize that the level-ups only provide passive bonuses, and the selection of odd modifiers on guns that give them unique properties and result in supposedly millions of weapons, most of which procedurally generated by the game using these modifiers and various weapon components. The problem with this is that no matter what goofy modifier you stick on a shotgun, it's always going to behave like a shotgun. It becomes a matter of swapping out (insert gun here) with (insert gun with better stats but is effectively the same thing here) whenever you come across a new one. And the worst part is that the weapons aren't even satisfying to use. The weapon handling in Borderlands is so bog-standard at best and the enemies are such bullet sponges that you never feel like you're wielding anything powerful. All you ever feel like is that the game will probably toss another weapon at you sometime soon that will make taking out the enemies slightly faster than before.

There's almost no point in even talking about the story or writing in general because it's all so thin it might as well not exist. The story is almost nonexistent in and of itself, with nothing to keep you interested until the game has its incredibly unsatisfying conclusion. Nobody I know plays Borderlands or any other Diablo-style game for the writing though, so I suppose that isn't as big a deal as it sounds. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, at least, but the jokes just aren't very funny. Wasted potential everywhere.

People say, like they do about every game that supports co-op, that Borderlands is better in co-op. I suppose if you like an incredibly laggy version of the normal singleplayer that plays no differently apart from having even more bullet spongey enemies than usual, then sure. Maybe you can find something to make fun of. The most amusement I got out of the co-op was initiating melee duels with the friend I was playing it with, and since I was a good number of levels higher than him, I basically took him out in one or two hits every time. Of course that means he was completely useless against the enemies I was taking on at that point and we had to go back to the earlier areas so he could even get leveled up to be even vaguely helpful against the hordes of mindless enemies at my level, so that certainly didn't help. I guess if you attempt to make fun of the game while you're playing it with a friend then it can be better than the mind-numbing tedium of the singleplayer, but even doing that you get bored pretty quickly.

For the life of me I can never figure out why people enjoy this sort of game in general, nor this specific one. It's just a grindfest. Grind to get leveled up so you stand a chance against foes in the next area, grind to get new equipment for the same reason, grind to advance the pathetic excuse of a plot, grind to complete quests... Nothing in this game is designed to actually be fun or enjoyable as far as I can tell. Addicting to people who are already addicted to loot gathering? Definitely. But not entertaining. With so many other games out there that are better-made and offer far more enjoyable experiences, I see no reason at all to recommend such a mind-numbingly boring title as Borderlands to anyone who hasn't already gotten hopelessly addicted to it or its sequel."
11471,It took my maybe 5 times of starting this game over new before i got in to it. The main thing i needed was a friend to start at the same level and run through it with me. It has since become one of my favorite games ever. The DLC is easily the best part it makes the game way more fun.
11472,"Apsolute great game, find it hard to get off it sometimes, so much to do, quests free roam, collect achievements.

Just great Fun!"
11473,This game starting to play alot better now since some work was done on it. moving right along. This game is good makes ya wanna play more and more.
11474,awesome with friend.  am not interested in playing alone.  7/10
11475,Excellent game with unique graphics.
11476,super
11477,Co-op mod is so hard. We are just cant launch it.
11478,"Really fun game lots of enjoyment
"
11479,"Got friends to beat this game in Co-op? no?, great, they would only slow you down."
11480,I love this game. If I didn't have to go to school I would stay home and play this game all day.
11481,"Hours upon hours of running and gunning. Best played with friends. Many guns, many skills and a whole lot of enemies to kill. This game is entertaining!"
11482,A really fun coop shooter.
11483,"BORED-erlands.

MORE LIKE SNORD-erlands."
11484,"Borderlands. Just the name is intriguing. Borderlands 2, well, even better. And the preqeul to Borderlands coming out? I think I'm gonna shit my pants. Jump into the world of Pandora. Another planet filled with Bandits and creatures called Skags. Explore the vast areas of Pandora including the Arid Badlands, Trash Coast, and The Salt Flats. Embark on a looting  qeust where you will find money, ammo and new weapons. Complete missions like The Rescue of a Broken Claptrap and run over or shoot aliens creatures. Play with your friends or play with total strangers and become a friend of them! But be careful, the many bandits and even Phsychos will try to kill you and your team-mates. But you can kill these enemies with different kinds of pistols and rifles, that you find yourself! Have a variety of weapons and play as different characters each with their own talents and unique personalities including, Mordecai, Brick, Roland, and Lilith. Meet the many interesting and funny characters along the way including Claptrap. The first person aspect gives the game an addicting feeling. Even better are the graphics. Some may not take to kindly to them, but I do. The cartoony feel gives an excellent blend of fast paced and fun gameplay while not hurting or tiring my eyes out. I highly recommend this intellegent game for anyone seeking fun and a new addiction."
11485,randy pitchford is a chode
11486,"A motherfucking classic of a game. Despite some issues that you would see in a console game, this is still a brilliantly crafted game."
11487,this game is better to play with friends
11488,Buy it or die alone and sad. 11/10
11489,"Wow.

After playing Borderlands 2, I had forgotten just how much I love this game.

This is my favorite Borderlands, and that's saying a lot considering how much I like it's sequel."
11490,"I love this game so much.  I've played through it at least a dozen times, and I still go back to it again and again.  It's a great FPS with RPG elements and tonnes of unique guns.  Some of them are hilariously good, like the double anarchy.  All the DLCs are fantastic too, except for the Mad Moxxi one.  Well worth the money."
11491,Hours apon Hours of fun
11492,"Great game with nice graphics, and exellent story. Be warned however that without getting a fix for the FOV you may get sick after a while."
11493,Fallout 3 with even more guns
11494,eh...
11495,oh mer gerd i came in meh pants to all dis gme guna get teh secnd one
11496,Still one of my favorite games of all time. Lots of great memories.
11497,"Don't bother- 2's consistently on sale for cheaper, is superior in most every way, and requires no prior knowledge of the series. That isn't to say that this is a bad game- far from it- but why waste your money?"
11498,"I shot a midget in the foot and he blew up

10/10"
11499,good game but extremely laggy. Steam if you read this i suggest making Borderlands 1 for mac PLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11500,A fantastic game that everyone should own!
11501,Borderlands was a great experiance!
11502,"No bad feeling about reality. This is unreal, like DOOM was. Just be-live :) it."
11503,"Got to Crawmerax, got sent to space, fell off map.

11/10."
11504,"Played this when I was younger. Got it again hoping that it would stand up to my nostalgia.
Unlike my father, this game did not disappoint me.

On a scale from 1-10, this game is still a 333."
11505,Played it for 1 hour during free week and i can say this game is ducking amazing
11506,"Sad that this game never ever goes on sale with its DLCs yet the NEWEST shitterlands made by a bunch of faggot hacks who have no clue how to make a videogame goes on sale for 5 dollars 3 months within release
Big yoinkers and zoinkers fuck everything except for the first game in this franchise, which is bae & based as fuck lootgrinder
testament to what came afterwards before the AAA downfall
fuck anthony burch
and fuck whore burch"
11507,Not that fun after a few hours. Just a big boring grind fest where the enemies are always scaled to your level so you never feel a sense of accomplishment and superiority.
11508,"Excellent game, nice art style and gameplay / storyline."
11509,"A great mixture of a dungeon crawling RPG with a fantastic FPS. While by yourself it pales in comparison to many of the other FPSes, adding in a few friends escalates it above many of it's peers in the genre. If you enjoy FPSes, but are looking for something a little different to play with friends, Borderlands is perfect. If you like dungeon crawlers, and don't hate FPSes, this game is going to be right up your alley."
11510,"I played Borderlands 2 before I played Borderlands, and now I see where Gearbox got all their momentum.  There are many mechanics that are taken out of it when it transitioned to BL2, though I think the level of customization is slightly better in the original.  There are a lot of things to keep track of, which is why I love it.  Give it a shot."
11511,"Borderlands is an interesting game no doubt. Be one of 4 classes, take on an entire planet of alien creatures and psychos. All this done with RPG mechanics, such as leveling up, skill upgrades, and health points. Of coarse with this game being out for a few years, all this is probably a no brainer, though even with Borderlands 2 and DLC, the first game is one heck of a game alone. Lots of guns, lots of enemies, and all for seeking a vault that contains unknown materials or material. And with that in mind, it's enough to already call this game good, and I'll leave it like that because, for a game that's been out for sometime, what else can really be said?"
11512,"I am a guy who plays a new game for a couple of months and then get bored of it. This game on the other hand, I have 500+ hours of it and I still am addicted to it. Its one of those games where you can play it all you want and still find new things. The game too is prettty funny. Story line wise, not that big of a fan of it. Some thing I do not like about the game is the cartoon graphics. It's not that big of deal though because once you start playing for a little bit, you become emersed and forget about the graphics. The game missions are somewhat repeatative, go here and get this, go here and kill that, go here and press this. What I do love about this game is the guns. THERE ARE SO MANY GUNS IN THIS GAME, finding the same gun twice is not a easy task. Some guns have the same name and the same type (sniper, pistol, etc.) but the guns always have slight variations (damage, fire rate, etc.)"
11513,"Easily one of the best shooters I've ever played, wish I'd bought it eartier."
11514,"Borderlands is a fun experiance with friends but it falls rather quickly in both Single Player and Multiplayer as it becomes incredibly repetitive and then the story attempts to become the negating factor in all of it but mostly fails because it is fairly bland.

The other main thing keeping the player interested is 'TeH l00t' which while I will say does work for the most part it starts to become somewhat busy work as the weapons start to only improve very minoraly and you have to sit there and look over which one you want, it certainly isn't a daming aspect but when this mechanic is one of the few things holding your interest in the game then you'll notice the niggeling details.

Personally I felt the story to be anti-climatic, as did my friend who I teamed up to play the game with and when it got to playing DLC well... we played about an hours worth and got bored with the game.

So final statment on Borderlands, it's alright but if I'd payed full price I don't think I'd of been to pleased with what I got."
11515,Worst rts of this century
11516,"If anyone is looking for a a new game, or seems interested. This game is definitly worth it, especially for $30 for the game and all the addons. Unlike Borderlands 2 this game does not lose its touch after the first play through, it is consistantly fun, everything feels right. The weapon variation feels how it should, theres not a constant drop of OP weapons. You dont get handed everything in the game, and this game isnt on the easy side unlike the second Borderlands. Ive clocked over 400+ hours on Borderlands 1 on the console, and just recently got this, and having a blast still."
11517,I can't say anything other than fun
11518,"Thanks to the series Call of Duty, I've sworn off FPS, as I find most of them are linear and offer no real intriguing story line, missions, and/or quests.  Plus, the weapons in series like CoD are lame at best.

Borderlands has changed my mind about FPS, and that FPS can be fun again.  I simply cannot put this game down, and the loot is fantastic.  The guns you can find (or buy) simply rock.  I also like the rpg element, where by you can upgrade your character plus mix and match weaponry/shields as you see fit.  

Unlike CoD, Borderlands lets you choose which character you want, including a female character.  Even though it is only 3 characters, at least you get a choice.  As well, fire fights require some level of strategy, not like CoD where it is just run and gun - doing that in Borderlands, you'll wind up dead.

Graphics are stunning, and each world is huge - tonnes of places to explore and lots of challenging enemies to kill.  A big 2 thumbs and 2 big toes up !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
11519,Just because I said I don't recommend this game doesn't mean I hate it. It did have good mechanics mixed in with this RPG/FPS but if you get stuck you are stuck for a long time. If you really wan't a borderlands game I suggest Borderlands 2. Mainly because its not as hard and it doesn't get repetitive.  I would give this title a 6/10.
11520,"One of my favorite games ever. I love all of its mechanics. The leveling, loot, skills and enemy mechanics all work great. You can go through New Game + after finishing the game. It will let you carry over everything you got from the first playthrough. The enemy levels will also increase and all loot will be leveled up. After beating the game a 2nd time, the enemies will level up with you and all loot will also.

There are somewhere over a million different gun combinations you can find in chests, drops, and shops. You never know what you will find, which is what makes it so exciting when you find something like a new chest to open. There are 4 different characters to try and they all have their own unique abilities and skill trees. So, you may want to keep some of your good equipment you find for other characters, to trade to 1 of your new characters later on.

The game will last you around 30 hours and you can add another 30 hours if you plan on getting all the DLC. The DLC is highly recommended. It raises your level cap and gives access to new equipment and lots of other things. Playing with friends is also highly recommended. It makes the game harder and better loot can drop from enemies.

If you are a fan of FPS combined with RPG elements, then this game is a must buy."
11521,"Oh Brick, you go punch that group of 30-or-so bandit delinquents
It's the only sensible choice."
11522,"Do you like humour, post-apocalyptic game worlds, and character skill trees/character progression of MMOS but want a pause button? Borderlands is a game that offers that. It also offers 4-player multiplayer options too if you choose to play it with strangers or friends.

While it's not a game I'll spend time playing after I beat it, it remains a unique title in that it provides an MMO experience not tied to the full-time job requirement or guilds to progress. Think 1-50 level progression without raiding. (Or if you prefer, think of the raiding part being new game+ with the MP options.)

Many years later, the game is still pleasant to play. In part because of its art direction and in part because it was made so well."
11523,"When I first got this on console i thought it was brilliant, just the way its set out and alos the campaign gets really fun. I reccomend this game to all people and also this is multiplayer so have fun with friends aswell."
11524,Awesome game if you have 3 friends.
11525,"If you like loot, shoot and travel across another planet, this is a game for you :)"
11526,"Do you like GUNS?! 
Do you like Loot?!

Well boy do I have a game for you! 

Gearbox and 2K's Borderland game is essentially just that - game based around guns and loot, and yet as you play you're invited into the very believable and 'live' world of Pandora. It's not long at all before you realise that this is more than your basic FPS, sure it has the First-Person viewpoint, and you, er, shoot, but there's an adventure in here too. It's rare that a FPS shooter has characters and humor injected into as rich as Borderlands, and looking back from when I originally played this on the 360, I'm not sure I've really played a game like it since.

It blends FPS and RPG elements together, and embraces our natural greed for better loot, to provide what I can only describe as a really fun time. It might have aged terribly since I last played, it and Borderlands 2 (and it's endless DLC) has been released since then too, but the first Borderlands game will always have a place in my games collection. It was one of the first fun Co-Op experiences I had, which in part was due to the 4 unique characters you could play as. Each character had their own traits and specialist role within a team, but could be equally as well-rounded if you played Solo. So you never really felt like you had 'picked the wrong class' when playing. Sure the game would change slightly depending on who you picked due to that character's 'natural' play style shaped by their traits and abilities, but nothing that would make the game less enjoyable.
In essence you had the Soldier, The Sniper, The Tank & The Magic classes to choose from. Each class comes with a speciality ability, and there are 3 seperate talent trees to spend skill points in to allow you to customise your characters abilities somewhat. 

The way the Co-op System worked was interesting, and one I wish was used more often. Every game you had saved was YOUR game, and it was up to you if you wanted your friends to join in and help YOU out in YOUR game. So you could play Solo and progress, or you could call in your friends and progress. The game wouldn't progress without you being there, so there was no real need to worry about slowing down other people's progress due to other commitments. 
Sadly, the PC version of Borderlands seems to come with a really terrible gamespy client that is hard to navigate compared to the Xbox360 Party System, which can at times make finding a party difficult and irritating. 

As mentioned previously, the ship might have sailed on Borderlands due to Borderlands 2 being released, but I still enjoyed it and for those with an older PC unable to run Borderlands 2 this might still be worth checking out if you're looking to scratch an itch when it comes to collecting guns..."
11527,"This game is the bomb. There are so many guns and the skill trees make this Role Playing FPS standout. The actual storyline is kinda weak, especially if you've played the second game, but that is irrelevent in comparison to its gameplay. The diverse enemies and bosses, in combination with the three badass DLC's (my favorite is The Armory of General Knoxx) really make this game amazing. 5 stars."
11528,Was fun for a little while but it gets pretty easy after awile overall its still worth playing
11529,"Awesome game, awesome story. The bandits are giving 2 much damage, that's unfair, but kinda realistic, the weapons are so epic. 10/10"
11530,"Awesome co-op shooter that satisfies the ""loot whore"" in all of us.  Gather up some friends, get a drink and a snack, and be ready to be sucked into countless hours of shooting and looting!!!"
11531,10/10 supr gud i havent slept in 67 hours all day every day pandora
11532,epic :yay:
11533,"This was a very fun game.  The story line (if it can be called that) isn't as gripping as something like Bioshock or Mass Effect but fun enough for it to be noticeable.

The characters are funny, fun and presented well and look very cool thanks to the art design.  The AI is pretty good with little practicability except for the fact that, if you wander far enough then back track, the same enemies return...which might be irritating for some but I found it useful for leveling up quickly.  One thing I found cheap was that some AI had a tendency to start shooting before they even had a change to see you.  Stupendous precognition or lazy-ass programming, you decide.

The vehicle controlled well and was a welcome addition to running everywhere and it also made running stuff down for easy, if not miniscule XP points, fun and quick.

Weapons were cool in spite of the fact that there are a crap-load of them and I probably didn't seen a fraction of then in the entirety of my first play through.  I say my first play through because I enjoyed it so much I'm considering at least one more in spite of my backlog of games.

One of the more interesting aspects of the game is the leveling.  Attack a target marked as one level higher than you currently if you want an extreme challenge.  I did beat one or two but it was taxing on my patience but I does make sure you stick to stuff until you are ready.  A couple of times I wandered around so much that by the time I took up a new challenge I was one or more levels higher making it too easy.  So if you want hard, even or really easy just keep an eye are you skill level and attempt as wanted.

Graphics are very good and I didn't notice any frame rate issues.  The art style is very enjoyable, a cell shade-ish comic book look that I hope I see a little more often.  It's good to see different art styles like this, LIMBO and Mad World around.

In this game you are basically vacuum constantly sucking up look and XP but I found it very fun and worth every penny and minute I spent on it.  No buyers remorse at any point."
11534,One of the best FPS RPGs ever made.
11535,Awesome game!!!
11536,"Good
"
11537,6.5/10. Decently fin gameplay. Story kind of sucks. Comic-style graphics are not appealing.
11538,PANDORA
11539,"absolutely amazing
"
11540,"Ah, Pandora, land of IM GOING TO SHOT YOU SHUDDUP AND ILL TAKE ALL YER LOOT AND SHOOT YER CHILDREN WITH IT!"
11541,This game has so many layers
11542,"Borderlands is a good cross between an FPS and an RPG, that requires a bit of grinding to get the most out of it. The gameplay revolves around completing quests by either collecring or killing things in the world. There are 4 unique classes to choose from.  The graphics are alright and the art style has a comicy look. The humour at some points is pretty good, however i wish there was more of it. The plot i thought was the weakest part of the game was just ok and not done that well. Only a hand full of cut scenes and lots of reading and audiologs are used to tell the story. The co-op multiplayer is fun, and the game has its own in built com system to talk to team mates. The game does have a few minor bugs the biggest of which is just getting the multiplayer to work (seeing as how gamespy closed a while back). Once you realize that the online log on stuff is just for the sake of getting multiplayer to work rather than creating like a full blown account, you'll have a ton of fun. After you beat the main story there's a sexond playthrough, that has a raised difficulty and 3 DLCs all of which are worth having. There is also a side boss that you will seriously need to grind to be able to fight. Have played this for like 80 or so hours the worst of which was the first area after which things get more interesting. This is worth playing."
11543,"shoot and loot - yeah

the graphics are a bit...oh well it's quite an old game, but you could say sufficient, it's fun to play - that is most important.
the story is linear, a lot of sidequests makes it a bit mire intresting and, if you can get it in a bundle, gaet the dlc´s too - the whole package, it is worth it and you'll have a good time shooting and looting -"
11544,This game would be okay if everything didn't take a billion bullets to kill while your team mates rush through the story.
11545,"Still A good shoot and loot game. As it has next to no story of any sort that kinda sucked. BUT I still enjoyed it.

6/10

P.S If you have a month to kill this is your game."
11546,"I would be surprised to see if some one had actually NOT played this game yet.  Its one of the most fun Action RPG hybrids ever made. probably not the first, but definately one of the best. it has this kind of cell shaded comic book feel, dark humor to go around and tons of bloody Violence. i think the only game better than this is Borderlands 2."
11547,10/10 would bang!
11548,This game is boring as shit
11549,"Addicting. Simple as that, looting is fun and I love developing a character that fits my shooter sensibilities as a whole. Probs the best shooter I've played in a while."
11550,"Okay first off let me explain this. 
No, borderlands 2 is not better in every way shape of form in comparison to this game, but there are things that make borderlands 2 much better.
To start, the story. Handsome jack is by far the bigest crotch bag I've ever fought in any game [spoiler] except Krotchy in postal 2[/spoiler] The characters seem alot more well written and have so much personality to them. Borderlands 1.... well some don't even have voice actors.
But one thing borderlands 2 failed where borderlands 1 succeeds is giving of that wastelandish feel to it. when you get to the first town of fyrestone the town is being attacked by bandits and the only one to uphold the law, is you.
Borderlands 2 also fails to bring in that anarchic feel to the game like borderlands one. Though it does make sense because the super power corperation in borderlands 2 does want to bring order to the planet.
All in all, Borderlands 1 is a great game. It may be flawed in terms of multiplayer. (it was even more flawed with the gamespy shut down a while back.)
 So give it a chance. If you like games with mindless violence involving aliens, criminals and the military, piles and piles of loot [spoiler] and Mad Moxxi with her massive er... ""loot chest"" [/spoiler] and a robot that wont shut the fuck up about how there's new missions available at the fyrestone bounty board, get this game."
11551,good gome
11552,You dont even wanna live without this game man.
11553,I thought this was going to be yet other boring shooter. Turns out I was wrong as it is acualy enjoyable.
11554,"At first I was a bit skiddish with the graphics. I remember saying ""I don't like the cartoony type"". Well, that opinion is long gone. Only a few hours of the game, and I was half in love with it already. Basegame is already amazing, but all the DLC's only make it better. This is one of the games I have returned back to, over and over again. I even bough myself a Steam version of the game in order to hunt for the achievements, despite the fact that this is my sixth time going through the game. Good music, nice vistas, nice opponents, and as a favorite feature for a person who likes teamwork and not eliminate friends from comptetition, co-op. In this game, working together actually is useful, and results in more (and better) loot. 

Me likey. A lot."
11555,Still a great game even if it is dated. When I first started playing I fell in love with the desolation and the music that made the game feel so remote. The qurkiness of the game made me want to play it more...although there isn't much of a story to the content I still enjoy logging on my sniper and taking out a few baddies.
11556,"despite a little lack of story, a very great game with an even greater athmosphere"
11557,"Can get a shotgun that fires a blue Mexican wave that kills Giant Bats.
10/10."
11558,I like this game
11559,This game is butts. I play it alot with hot girlfriend. Hot girlfriend play siren everytime. I play mexican goggles and throw birds at people. This sounds like good game but it is same game for too many hours. I played much more of this on xbox where I could split screen and I liked it there. Borderlands 2 is a much better game and is usually cheapish and you don't have to play the first one to get the second one so play that instead.
11560,Lovey game! the graphics and story is really nice. Woud strongley rec to play with a friends makes it so mutch more fun to play
11561,I deleted it to make extra space on my old comeputer (it also was a terrible laptop so it wouldn't run wll) but this game and especially the sequal are AMAZING this game is deffinatly going down in gaming history as an all around great game.
11562,"Borderlands is a classic, timeless FPS game.  The graphics areCo-op muitiplayer games, up to  four players, are a fun & welcome challenge.  The storyline is entertaining, engaging & comical.   All of the DLC's have a story arc that I found engaging.  The Secret Armory of Knoxx DLC is probably the roughtest part of this series.  There is no fast travel option which makes it difficult for players who play in shorter sessions.  Each time you load into the Knoxx DLC region, you start at T-Bone Junction & have to fight, walk & drive to your questing area.  Sometimes this push to the questing area would take 45 minutes.  The Armory was also dissapointing as you only have a limited amount of time to scour for weapon upgrades before you are booted from the safe, never to see this treasure trove again."
11563,tops
11564,"One of the best multiplayer games you can find. Recommended playing with friends, but still enjoyable by yourself."
11565,Awesome game.
11566,"Best game I ever bought
"
11567,"Great game, love every hour I spent playing it. Gameplay is great, feels very rewarding, and the story is entertaining but Borderlands is not mostly based on the storyline. For those of you that have not played Borderlands, its a ""comicbook-like"" shooter. the graphics are bold and in your face, but it makes the game creative and unique. It's very entertaining, and theres always something for you to do. ias you can see, I have over 30 hours in it, and I have not beat the game yet. 
Although I do have to say, I recommend Borderlands 2 a bit more, everything they lacked in Borderlands One, they made up for in the second game. If Borderlands two had not been created, would rate this game a 9/10 (no games are perfect) 
Definitely worth the buy!"
11568,"This game all-though not as good as borderlands 2, was definitly amazing. especially for it's time.
I got this game back when it came out and had 14 hours of pure fun as a kid with my best friend.
And if you want something fun this is a great choice. if you want to play the entire borderlands series. start with this game cause if you start with 2 you don't want to go back. because then it just feels like you are missing alot of stuff that was in 2."
11569,one of the best fps/rpg combos out there
11570,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!! I'm in love with revolvers and have  one that does 2000 damage!!!!
11571,"Absolutely one of the best RPGs out there, ITS MADNESS!"
11572,for the love of god dont buy this game... Unless you like pointless shooters then go ahead.
11573,Amazing loved it
11574,"Had this game on the xbox 360 before it broke. Very fun game, lots of gameplay and even more when  you add in the dlc's. The only thing i dont care for are the way the graphics are but i can look past that with a game as good as this. Highly recommennd."
11575,this game is very good when you have a SDK to make maps just love it :D
11576,"Amazing gameplay, you get into the game very quickly thanks to it. Great graphics (for when it was released), fun to play. Full recommendation!"
11577,"Sweet co-op game, very funny with friends. Four different characters, long gameplay, epic loot, some of the best DLC I've seen. Buy it its very cheap now!

And ridiculous Claptrap!"
11578,"I shot at things and it was fun. 10/10
"
11579,"When this game first came out, I thought it was mainly a multi player RPG, so I didn't pay much attention to it.  Found out it was also a solid single player game, so I gave it a try, and am very happy I did.  Look forward to many happy non-productive hours with this!"
11580,Borderlands ... STRONK!
11581,this guy is shooting him haed
11582,The most awesome shooter i've ever played.
11583,not multiplayer just skip this and get borderlands 2 this was a waste of money it is garbage
11584,"I adore this game, bought it on sale for around $10 USD and am half-way through my second playthrough XD
My only issue is I /think/ I bought the GoTY edition but I can't tell if it's woking... Couldn't find any of the special areas nor the special car... either way, love it and I cant wait untill 2 goes on sale!"
11585,"This game is pretty much perfect. You can spend so much time playing through the main storyline (twice with the same character as a result of Hardcore mode) and completing every sidequest available, just to doo it all over again with a new character. Add some friends, and it's a party. If I could make a few suggestions if you're someone who would be interested in buying this game, buy the GotY edition. I bought it for 15 bucks during the christmas sale, and it was money well spent. Each of the DLCs for this game can add another 10 hours of play time. Second, start off as Brick if you're completely new to the game, his muscle mass and hilarious look of him wielding a tiny SMG are things you can't forget about. If you're squeamish, good luck trying to bleach your brain of Borderlands, but this game is incredible in a special way, in that it's a game you can have endless amounts of fun playing.
"
11586,"Great game, however the online only works when it feels like it."
11587,ht
11588,"A crazy action-adventure RPG where you play a vault hunter - a mercenary who desperately tries to find the vault to claim its hidden treasures. There are 4 different characters (classes) you can choose from that offer 4 different play-styles. There is an enormous amount of items found in this game - really, the amount of weapons you can find is just amazing. Colours indicate their extra features - this is similar to Diablo. The rarer weapons you find the stronger it is. 

There are tons of missions to complete and many conversations to listen to. It is a sin to skip even one single side mission as the dialogue is very, very entertaining and funny. In addition to this, the game has 4 DLCs that take you to different areas and continue the already silly story by telling you further adventures.

I guess the only difference between this and its sequel is that the first episode lacks a proper antagonist. There's no main villain here which is a bit of a let down once you complete the game and encounter the final boss. Still, this one small flaw cannot ruin the experience for you as your walkthrough will be entertaining all the way.

Also, the sequel has a bit more vivid colours that was a nice change compared to this episode where everything is grey or brown. Anyway, Borderlands is a great game and best played with friends (you need them for some of the boss battles). Playing the first one to understand the sequel's story is not mandatory. If it is discounted, though, picking up the game of the year edition can be one of the best gifts on Steam.
"
11589,"High Replability, Many expansions. 100+ Hours of content. Well Worth the money. Graphics 8/10 Sound 8/10 Gameplay 10/10 Overall. 9/10"
11590,FPS Looter.  Think Diablo meets guns and first person view... with Cell-Shading.  Don't miss it.
11591,FPS mixed with RPG is just amazing. borderlands is the right game for anyone highly recomend it
11592,best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11593,Definitely one of the best Free-Roam RPG's in existence. My only complaint is that I can't name my guns.
11594,Midgets 10/10
11595,"Loot, loot, and more loot. Anyone who's ever played a RPG loves games that reward you for everything you do and this game does that in truckloads. Kill a grunt, get a gun. Open a locker, get some grenades. Reach into a toilet, grab a legendary item. Loot aside, this game is a fun FPS as well. It's not necessarily about how accurate you are but about how much of the area in front of you, and sometimes behind you, you can cover with bullets. Throw enough bullets out there, you're bound to hit something.

Borderlands combines two great genres of games with a fun story and characters that don't take themselves too seriously. With the main game taking 20+ hours and 4 DLCs that add at least 5+ hours of gameplay and new bosses to experience, this game is well worth the time and money.

Grab some friends, grab some guns, and take a shot at everything."
11596,awesome
11597,"Okay, so to start off with this review, Borderlands is amazing game and runs pretty well on my laptop gpu with mixed-high settings.The game itself is a time killer with the amounts of fun you can have whilst doing quests and exploring about, and the joy of shooting Skags, ooh boy.


Also, they have midget baddies.

10/10"
11598,"Gameplay: 5/10
Music/sounds: 8/10
Storyline: 4/10

this game was pretty good, it was a bit dry, so to speak. its like borderlands 2 was two borderlands 1s' mixed together with explosions. gets boring after an hour"
11599,"Its got amazing gameplay and its really good mission wise not a game you can complete in 15 minutes
"
11600,"This game is awesome.  I've played this game more hours than I can even remember, don't let the hours played on steam fool you, I also own it on other platforms.

While this game may not appeal to everyone, fans of FPS games should at least give it a try if they find it on sale at a reasonable price.  The character buildup  is easy to figure out and isn't horribly in depth, which is good for the kind of fast paced action this game can be.  My only real issue with the game, is if you happen to do all the side quests when they become available, before the story quests, the game starts to feel a little too easy."
11601,Not the best storyline but great gameplay and co-op.
11602,"Who doesnt like Borderlands? Everyone has enjoyed a Borderlands game at some time. In Borderlands you'll find polish and refined controls. And the RPG elements behind this first person shooter make the game and all around great experience.

Borderlands simply a fantastic game 9 out of 10. :D"
11603,Quite fun although a massive grind which can get very boring after a while. Fun to play with friends!
11604,Strangely addicting.
11605,Excellent game. perfect for those who enjoy a challenge.
11606,Good for a gun type of genre.
11607,"I played this game a lot on Xbox 360 shortly after it released, than hadn't played it in a few years until after switching to PC and buying Borderlands 2. It is still pretty good and can hold a candle to Borderlands 2, but I do encounter some issues with it not having verticle sync. This can cause screen ""tearing"" which is pretty annoying, but it is easily fixed by download Rivatuner and finding the D3DOverrider within Rivatuner's folders."
11608,"What should I say about this game that makes me wish there were more hours in the day, that makes my head playback the in game music when I'm approaching the traffic light as it turns yellow?  This game has a blend of Road Warrior, RPG, and Battlefield that makes me stay up later, ignore my family, and hate my day job more than I should let it.  I can't help myself.  The story line is great, the characters clever and funny, the missions enthralling and the comic book look and feel mesmerizing.  I love playing this game ... a lot."
11609,Endless hours of fun - be sure to bring some friends!
11610,AWSOME game
11611,"One of the greatest games that have ever been released. If you play RPG and FPS games, you will certainly appreciate what Borderlands has to offer. The first time I played the game it felt like a void was filled in my gaming life. It's so addicting, the story is great, with a lot of humor, cel shaded graphics make it even prettier. Gameplay wise it plays like any other shooter. It's solid and well made. Different classes change the gameplay quite a bit, and a lot and a lot of loot. A LOT OF LOOT. Sooooo many weapons. You will never get tired of hoarding legendaries. Also the DLCs are really good. 10/10

MUST PLAY to anyone who dares say he ""likes"" FPS games."
11612,"One of the best FPS action-adventure RPGs out there. I'd recommend this to just about anyone with a Steam account, especially if you see a sale where it's a mere $5. You won't regret the purchase."
11613,"Excellent first person shooter with a massive loot system full of lewt! 

Love the comedy side of the game too, makes me giggle amongst all the bloodshed!"
11614,"Awesome Game, Best Story-Line, Competitive Enemies, Award Winning DLC's, & to add to it, a Co-Op FPS consisting of RPG elements. Anything else you expect from a GOTY ? A bit of Spoiler though....using your Brain is the key in here. Also the final Boss, typical classic RPG style. :D
Whatcha waiting for ? You have it in your library, then play it dammit."
11615,"Quite simply brilliant, and amazing in co-op."
11616,"best fuckin game evah
"
11617,"I beat this game and its sequel on Xbox...I have really no idea why I bought it again...

Anyway, this is one of my favorite games. I remeber just being bored one day and asking myu brother what new games where out. He told me that his friends have been playing a game called BORDERLANDS. It soon became one of my favorite games and I was sooo excited about the sequel. Borderlands 2, by the way, is MUCH BETTEr than this (even though the first is amazing). If you only had to choose one, I d say go eith borderlands 2, but other than that get both!"
11618,When this came out it was my favourite game for a year. A+
11619,"This started the whole Borderlands universe and it's fanbase even if I did start with the sequel and it's much better. You can't help but love this even if it is way more simple in it's story and not many cutscenes to it, it's a masterpeice that Gearbox has managed to make after their success with Half-life Opposing Forces, Blue Shift, and it's Brothers in Arms series. Yes Gearbox had those games which were ""meh"" but Borderlands it not in that catagory. It's a FPS and RPG game combines. For a fan who loves rpgs but sucks at shooters this is great. This begins your journey on Pandora. And to that I say, Roland, Lilith, Brick, Mordi, Goodluck."
11620,"A very good game to play. A good fps, with a loot system that adds an rpg feel to it. The game incorporates a witty sense of humor that will make you laugh during the game. While the game has enough content, it might get long at some point doing fetch quest solo. But thats where the game shines, as it's made to play with friends making the whole game one big adventure. 
The art style is made differently then the realistic look in most modern games, making it look good after a few years. The soundtracks are good and stay give it a good ""feel"" to the game. 

All in all a great game to pick up for LAN or just to try out."
11621,"Good game. A bit of a grinder, but it has it's moments. Nice art style makes this game unique."
11622,"In my opinion, a great game!  I had almost never played first-person shooters, but had bought this game on sale.  It was a great way for me to start learning on.  I am still trying to play it through on all of the classes.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  At present, I am looking forward to playing the sequel :D"
11623,Make sure you don't already own this game before you waste another $30.00... F#CK!
11624,It's like Diablo but with guns!
11625,"Borderlands is a great loot based game. There is a lot to do and full enjoyment/for the completionists you will need to do multiple playthroughs as there is a NG+ type of system involved.

The gameplay is great with loads of different guns, grenades and 4 classes.

The story is humourus and exciting.

The graphics hold up well as well.

The DLC is also recommended. 

This is a great FPS."
11626,Actually kinda fun
11627,BEST GAME EVER
11628,kinda like borderlands 2 but without the 2
11629,Great Game.
11630,baas
11631,"Really fun and great game, a nice combination between a FPS and an RPG.

The dystopic world of Pandora, full of bandits and scavengers it's an interesting and colourful setting. 

From a gameplay point of view, the game is really great since it combines the adrenaline of a shooter with the pleasure of seeing your character grow and level up just like in an RPG.

The GOTY edition contains all packs so overall it's worth the price."
11632,"Borderlands is by far one of the best games I've played.  At first I thought I wouldn't like the heavy cell-shading, but once I started playing it, the story, the humour, and the game play was addictive!  I couldn't stop playing it!  I want Borderlands 2 next!!!!"
11633,almost as good as B2orderlands 2
11634,"Humor, action and the best pack of DLC I ever saw. I recommend this game for four friends."
11635,"by far better than any game i have owned so far i even have number 2 and i think 1 is better
"
11636,"Kill enemies to get loot, then kill enemies faster and in more innovating ways to get more and better loot to kill more enemies in order to get the best loot!!! Escalates quickly, tons of fun to be had in this game"
11637,fun
11638,"So so... It's not my favorite but is an ok FPS game (on my opinion, off course)"
11639,I SHOT A CRAZY MIDGET IN THE FACE WITH A ROCKET LAUNCHER!
11640,"This is the best Co-op game i have every played... All you need is 4 friends with 4 different characters and you can have loads of fun... The game is well balanced, though some missions are repetative it is quite enjoyable. The shear size of the open world is amazing and the storyline is great. Worth the buy."
11641,The first game in an amazing seires! love this game and it's DLC ill admit i did play Borderlands 2 more but regardless amazing game if you have played Borderlands 2 i recomend playing the first it's well worth it.
11642,"Borderlands is a good game with a good story but can get very boring. I have tried many times to complete the story both with and without friends but i just cant seem to make because it gets so boring.After saying that, it is a good game and can be fun at points when playing with friends but i dont recommend getting this game if you get bored of long stories easily."
11643,"On loading the resolution was a bit off and found it strangely difficult to change (but don't worry, its easy to fix, I'm just blind) so now my resolution is sitting happily at 1680 x 1050 :) The game has no difficulty settings which could potentially be worrying when I get stuck on later levels but so far have only died twice! Would recommend this game as it has a brilliant style and story (and that's saying something as I am an animator who does this sort of thing for a living!) It is still a tad overpriced for a relatively old game but with the release of the second Borderlands who can blame the developers for raising the price of the original? And this game definitely feels original. Over and out."
11644,"It's a good game with gameplay that can be repetitive, and the story is interesting if I had to rate it 7/10"
11645,Wheeeeeeeeeeee! Holy Shit! WheeeeeEEEeeeeeeeee
11646,Hearing Brick run around gets me horny everytime
11647,"how do i use a key code
"
11648,"Fun with friends, used to be interesting. Not so much anymore. 2 is much better."
11649,"My personal favorite co-op game, its basically a full campign dedicated to the idea of co-op, not many games have that. Millions of guns, good classes and crazy enimies make this a fun game, the story is a bit hard to follow though, and not to mention pointless, the whole purpose being just to get you to do another playthrough.
8.5/10"
11650,Overrated garbage.
11651,"Oh my, oh my where do I start. This is the game I had every friend down my neck telling me to play. 
This game has many great things such as a fun theme that is unique with characters that are very likeable however for me this is where it ends.

The game had very mediocre difficulty that could have you skipping side missions and going straight into the main story just to make the game that little more difficult. The fact that the only game mechanic for mobs was that I only had to shoot an enemy in the head or behind made for very long dull gameplay that feels like it would only be difficulty for console. (Kind of think it was made for console) About the only thing that did make the game difficult was not getting stronger guns to finish off them easy mobs quicker. To finally make your way to the last boss to see nothing but an appalling ending then left me very, VERY, disappointed.
However if all these things are ok to you then I highly recommend teaming up with a few friends and blast your way through each zone collecting guns.

Benefits of the game:

Funny, interesting characters,
Insane gun looting,
Immersive world
Funny Glitches

Cons of the game:

Super easy,
Short story,
Appalling story ending,
Can be repetitive for some (but this is something not to complain about in an RPG)
Really bad team share"
11652,Never ending fun!
11653,"One of those games that its fun to play with friends. I would however recommend that you don't play it by yourself orwith random strangers unless you like being bored or getting into arguments cos the gits stole all the loot again.

Great co-op game with a fab sound track, entertaining dialog (if you ignore the ^*%*&%""£*(£) robot) but a disapointing end."
11654,Probably the most fun game I've ever played co-op in. :)
11655,"the most boring but somehow addicting game, thankfully borderlands 2 is much better."
11656,Snore-derlands
11657,"This game is worth every peney of you're money at full price and even better on sale tho the stongest elaments of this game is the co-op how ever it is verry fun single player but if you can play it with friends do so. this game knows what it wants to do and it dilivers it exalently all the elaments are verry somoth form the gun play to the rpg inspierd skill trees. i would say to play it with a controler as its kind of kluncy on keybored and mouse likely do to it being made with controlers in mined. all in all a good game 
85/100"
11658,So much todo so little time. Crude and rude humor along with wacky cartoon style makes this game a must buy. Trying to 100% it thats how engaging it gets. Enjoy your stay in Pandora!!!
11659,Excellent FPS CO-Op with MMO elements.
11660,THIS FGAME IS FUCKING AWESOME 20/10
11661,"Vey fun game, highly recommend playing!"
11662,"This is one of the most fun co-op campaign FPS games I've played in ages.  I've gone through it countless times on console, and find it quite serviceble on PC.  While it is balanced favoring the Siren due to the commonality of better suited drops for her, it's entirely fun and playable as all of the classes and an excellent way to spend an afternoon with friends.  It's a nice blend of modern MMORPG equipment collection with casual shoot 'em up action and a taste of snarky comedy writing."
11663,"Forget all the other games. Borderlands has the shiniest meat bicycle of them all.

10/10

11665,just play the sequel
11666,Sweet mother of cream cheese squirls... GET. THIS. GAME!!!
11667,"If you have played borderlands 2, I recommend playing this one for the story aspect of it. Graphics are not great but still a good game."
11668,"I bought the game of the year edition
but how do i get the Duke NUkem first access codes?
"
11669,CLAP-TRAPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11670,"A game filled with humor and crazy situations. Awesome characters and gamplay. It is better to play this with friends than alone, but it will still be a great game if you cant find other people to play with. The endind may result a bit dissapointing to some people, I just laughed at it."
11671,badass

11673,"В хранилище монстр, Ангел хочет чтобы волтхантеры его пробудили."
11674,"Post-apocalyptic atmosphere, wastelands and charismatic characters.
10/10"
11675,"In contrast to its sequel Memelands - which stars all the garbage humor the creators' children found off the front page of 9gag and Reddit and the most uninterestingly spastic antagonist in any video game I've played to date - Borderlands 1 constructs humor on its own and maintains a respectably interesting storyline that makes you feel at least remotely engaged in the plot.  It also does, in fact, feature literally millions of potential unique weapons being created by the game, much unlike Borderlands 2 which scapegoated their dumbing down of the weapon generating system by referring to the game as having ""bajillions of guns"" or some fake number like that.  

In quicker summary, if you want a fun game that is at least fairly tolerable to play solo and keeps a fair balance of crude and sly humor mixed in with the serious plotline, ignore the shitstain that is Borderlands 2 and pick up its prequel.  Borderlands 1 is one of my favorite first-person shooters of the past few years and it's a damn shame they butchered the second one so horribly in the attempt to pander to children."
11676,this is a game you can skip. unplayable if you've played Borderlands 2 or any FPS in recent years.
11677,"awesome for first few hours after it was nothing but crashing, very frustrating try to fix this steam"
11678,"Great shooter with RPG elements. Shooting enemies is so much more fun when it gives you a level up. Then when you get to pop that skill point into a new ability, you get a great feeling of progression.

The story is interesting and spread out among very excentric characters you meet in your travels. 

The four player coop is lots of fun but you might miss out on some loot or story because four people are moving along.

The environments are pretty bland but it is made up by filling it with off the wall characters and enemies."
11679,"Do not buy this game as it does not work on Windows 8 or 8.1 (almost all votes incompatible)
Noone seems to be pursuing this and although this was an awesome game I cannot recommend it anymore.

"
11680,Excellent game. In every way. Get it. Play it. Love it.
11681,"Best. Game. 

Rating: 11.42/10"
11682,Not bad
11683,It's like Skyrim with loot.
11684,"This game, the never-ending, legendary (weapons), gory, free-for-all, RPG that is Borderlands.  This game is like a fast-paced Fallout, but in an even more rogue-like planet.  The humorous dialouge and brilliant soundtrack allows this game to beat the second by FAR."
11685,"Cool game! Wicked graphics and smooth fun gameplay! Well recommended to anyone who likes FPS and completing missions. Another fantastic game built on the Unreal Tournament engine which, for me, says it all!"
11686,"best first person shooter after half life series. this game what I always wanted to play, but I could not name it. mix of half life and atmosphere of witty original fallout game"
11687,"This game lasts long and is entertaining, it is difficult to level up though."
11688,Best Game on The Planet!!!!!!!!
11689,Really cool game loved it
11690,Borderlands was tons of fun in local co-op.  Borderlands 2 is however the new king.
11691,i had my doubts about this game but since I do love guns and loot there was no way of resisting it. If you like RPG shooters with an insane amount of loot than you will love this game. I highly recommend playing this game especially if you have some friend who will play it with you
11692,"The original shoot 'n loot, with a great sense of humor. 5/5 claptraps."
11693,"Another game i would like to reexperience with a group of people. The story is ok, however boss fights and running missions with friends has never been as much fun as in this game."
11694,"Interesting game, liked the game play... Hate the graphics of it. Story was good, characters were great. Hit boxes could use a little work but not a bad game. 5 out of 10."
11695,"This game is seriously fun. It's a mix of a fast paced shooter and an RPG. The art style is a fantasic cartoony look like TF2. The guns feel really awesome and there are literally thousands of guns. There are even really rare guns that will have you piss yourself with hapiness once you find one. I love the sense of humor this game has. The enemy bosses, the little robots, and characters are hilarious. Speaking of bosses, there are boss fights! The 4 player co-op is really fun. This has to be one of the most fun games I've played. I recommend getting all the DLC's."
11696,"The best FPS ever. Full of missions, skills and fun."
11697,"This game uses Gamespy who no longer exists so you cannot play multiplayer so this is a total waste of money
DO NOT BUY :P"
11698,gooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
11699,Its Great
11700,"Borderlands is fun, fast-paced adventure in a game-world where hyperbole is exemplified in the explosions and the guns and characters that cause them.  The story is unique, clever, and makes the player feel like they are the only sane person in this post-apocalyptic dystopia.  The RPG component helps to immerse the player into the world by allowing an opportunity for the player to feel invested in the character as they make decisions that grow their character in a variety of branching directions.  The dialog is refreshingly quick and clever.  I wish more developers would spend time of the story component of their games instead of tacking on cliché dialog and overwrought cut-scenes that look like animated versions of artwork from the cover of video card boxes.
The only negative against the game is the lack of variety in enemies and vehicles."
11701,"I played through Borderlands 2 before I played Borderlands 1 GOTY edition. If you've already played BL2 but not BL1, then all you need to know is that the gameplay mechanics are the same. The story in BL2 picks up from BL1 and the environments are similar since you are on Pandora. BL2 feels more refined than BL1 but if you really enjoyed BL2 and haven't played BL1, then I'd recommend picking up the first game for at least one playthrough. If you've not played any of the Borderlands games and want to get into them, then I'd suggest starting with the first game. I currently have 52 hours on BL1 and that's going through the game and most of the DLC."
11702,"I love this game. As good as the second one, and better in a lot of regards. Worth a purchase, no doubt."
11703,"Its amazing
"
11704,Get the game and we'll play.
11705,Amazing
11706,This game ruined my mid-life crisis.
11707,a real bang for your buck! 10/10
11708,"Not as good as the sequel, and that's because the latter improved every single aspect of the game; but the core game was never the less very, very good! Get the GOTY version when it goes on sale ;)"
11709,"Not as wild and crazy and actionpacked as BL2 but still a awesome great game!

BL1 feels more like a strategic shooter than BL2's wild blazing non-stop action; and I liked that alot. If you started with BL2, like I did, you will NOT be dissapointed of BL1. Not one bit!"
11710,"This game lets you shoot people.  But don't worry, they aren't real."
11711,Gun shaped hats for all!
11712,"I dig it. I liked the story and being a part of the universe. The gear collecting mechanic doesn't really get to me. It's probably why Diablo was a one play through game for me. Still, it's totally worth getting this and playing it. I still haven't beaten all the DLC."
11713,"Funny, entertaining for you and your friends, good story."
11714,"Extraordinary even now, Borderlands represents the starting point of a franchise that deserves to be played.
One of the 100 games to try during your life time! I's a must!"
11715,"This game is amazing. Great story, lots of guns, lots of fun :)"
11716,Shoot loot and monsters.   the story is fun and well made along with the gameplay. dlc´s have unique stories to tell and epic loot the find
11717,"Amazing game. A new and fun way to play an FPS, while being challenging yet not that competitive and stressful. The story is amazing and the characters are very relatable, if a little odd. 9/10 Always suggest to buy and play this."
11718,Couldn't launch game on Win7 x64 with an AMD GPU.
11719,this game was and still is the perfect comonation of fps and rpg.Much better experiance than borderlands 2.
11720,"Great game, esspecially with friends"
11721,The best game ever... Hands down the BEST!
11722,preddy guud
11723,"Horrible, repetitive game.

Those are 89 hours of my life I'll never get back.

I hate my OCD"
11724,"its awesome,espesially borderlands 2"
11725,"Borderlands is the perfect mix of FPS and RPG and has given me many hours of enjoyment, so heres my rundown:

[b]Guns, Guns and Loot[/b]
Borderlands offers a Diablo -esce randomized loot system offering loads of types of guns (no two are alike, ever) and is the first game ive ever played to bring such varied change to the simple tried and true grenade; with grenade mods adding lots of variety and characteristics.

[b]Roleplaying, I thought thats like D&D!? (Storyline) [/b]
With a sound story, simple enough to be interesting but not long winded enough to inspire hate, Borderlands offers a great experience as you journey to find the vault and all its alien technology but you'll have to fight a few psychos and crazy corporations along the way. Dont assume this is linear however, Borderlands offers many, many sidequests and quirky inhabitants of pandora to keep things varied!

[b]Characters and Pandora[/b]
Pandora is a Border planet and nobody really cares who or what happens there, theft? murder? Meat Bicycles!? (ask the psychos)

There are many interesting characters such as Dr Zed, Marcus our friendly Gun Overlord (buy anywhere else and he'll kill you) TK Baha, Mad Moxxi and the like, but at times as you travel out of the very few sane areas you'll start to feel very lonely as only skags and lunatics will be you're company!

[b]Multiplayer[/b]
What can I say, the multiplayer is great, as more players join the harder the enemies get and the better the loot is, not to mention the current host can select anyones quest to do; so play from start to finish with others and dont be afraid to join new people everytime!

[b]Overall Rating: 10/10[/b]

[b]Why I gave this rating:[/b]
Borderlands doesnt try to hard to be serious, Infact it tried to be as zany as possible and because of this regardless of its faults (which you can read in other reviews) it offers a mad gun/loot crazy bloodbath of [b]FUN![/b]

[b]Keep reading for DLC Reviews[/b]

[b]The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned: [/b] (SPOILER ALERT, if you have not finished borderlands)
The First DLC for borderlands Brings us to a new land on Pandora, Jacobs Cove. This land is infested with the undead thanks to Dr Zeds Second (out of four) brothers Dr. Ned (who also has a REAL doctorate.)
This DLC is suggested for level 10 and up.

But fear not as all isnt bleak for an old friend is also returning; the horribly murdered TK Baha (I missed him) and he is mildy sane, but really hungry for some brains. infact 100% of his new dialogue is brain related.

[b]Guns, Loot and Zombies[/b]
Naturally there are new ""EPIC"" loot drops to make you smile but the real magic is in the zombies, their not fast, they are old school to the core, nigh Invincible unless you get a [b]Headshot![/b]

[b]New Content (what you get for what you pay)[/b]
Get off the boat and save Jacobs-town and keep it as you're own personal Stronghold against the undead horde! (since everyone else is dead.) This is a nice big island, and aside from being full of pestilence; is the most foliage you will ever see in borderlands, ever.... EVER.

25... Sorry Twenty-Five new missions (and some pretty long and hard) will entertain you for hours, there are even whole new enemy additions such as [b]pumpkinhead[/b] and [b]Tankensteins[/b] for you to Murder-late!

[b]Overall Rating: 10/10[/b]

[b]Why I gave this rating:[/b]
I could honestly just sum this up with [b]TK BAHA[/b] but alas a lot of effort was put into his dlc (obvious scooby doo references worked into it aside) new enemies, a whole new island and a heap of missions but seriously... [b]TK BAHA.[/b]

[b]Keep reading for the second DLC Review[/b]

[b]Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot:[/b]
The second DLC to come out for Borderlands and its all about Mad Moxxi and her [b]Underdome[/b] if you know what I mean (you dont, keep reading.) Thats right a bloodsport arena where you get to fight to the death, in the same arena, that never changes, over and over again for One-Hundred Round Waves of enemies.. If that sounded negative read on.

[b]Guns, Loot and Booty[/b]
There is no booty, only loot, cheering crowds and seemingly endless slaughter while moxxi screams over the megaphone. not much more I can say here.

[b]New Content (what you get for what you pay)[/b]
If an arena mode style of play is enjoyable to you (for 100 waves) by all means get this dlc, not to say its bad but the only thing that really kept me killing was the atmosphere and the dialogue. Not to say this dlc isnt completely unredeemable it also features a much needed Banking feature so you can store up to 42 of you're favorite guns, long gone are the days of having to discard a gun, grenade or class mod you love just because you need to make way for the new or different. and if it appeals to you it is run by a claptrap in a tuxedo so you know you're items are safe!

Also note that you can earn a total of two [b]extra skill points[/b] for ""enjoying"" this dlc in both playthrough one and two.

[b]Overall Rating: 5.5/10[/b]

[b]Why I gave this rating:[/b]
I honestly found this one difficult to rate, it costs the same as the previous dlc but it feels like you're getting less especially since there is no meaningful storyline added to the game. Moxxi however is a wonderful, crazy and colourful character a decent addition to the game, the underdome is a nice place to hang out if the music looping doesnt send you crazy and Lets not forget the [b]Bank[/b], its a [b]Bank[/b], we need a [b]Bank.[/b]

[b]Keep reading for the third DLC Review[/b]

[b]The Secret Armory of General Knoxx:[/b]
In this third DLC installment all your prayers are answered, if you plan on only buying a single dlc get this one; why? it has everything. Our [b]mad[/b] General Knoxx is at a low point in his career, he wants some vault loot and he's brought so much firepower he might aswell raid his own base. Be warned the assassins are out in force to kill you but luckily a betrayer is on your side (for unknown reasons) this rogue is going to help you take down knoxx and get that delicious loot or something about ending his tyranny I dont know, [b]Just give me the guns![/b]

[b]Guns, Loot and Giant Robots (Chicks dig them)[/b]
With the three new vehicles in this dlc you're going to be cruising around a lot, and killing a lot for very good reasons so much new loot to gain and 11 new levels to train but be careful you dont run into Crawmerax the Invincible too early (but kill him for amazing [b]pearlescent[/b] loot!)

[b]New Content (what you get for what you pay)[/b]
Where to begin? Where does it end! [b]

| 11 NEW LEVELS | 
| 43 New Missions |
| New Guns | 
| New Class Mods |
| New Vehicles |
| New Enemies | 
| New Pearlescent Gun/Mod Rarity! |
| God-Tier Endgame Boss' | 
| Bigger Loot Chests |
[/b]

[b]Overall Rating: 10/10[/b]

[b]Why I gave this rating:[/b]
Borderlands ends at 50 and the Secret Armory of General Knoxx begins, this is the real endgame right here and there is a lot of it, in terms of cost I got more than I paid for, there is just so much content crammed into this dlc. Gearbox said it: [b]best add-on ever. Of all time. Forever. The End.[/b]

[b]Keep reading for the fourth and Final DLC Review[/b] (I have to keep this short as im reaching the character limit)

[b]Borderlands: Claptrap's Robot Revolution:[/b]
The fourth and final dlc for the much loved borderlands. Hyperion is sick of buying your guns and decided the vault hunters are a drain on profits, solution? they want you dead and they have sent the [b]top-secret, Interplanetary Ninja Assassin Claptrap![/b] to kill you but he turns on hyperion and wants all life on pandora converted to claptraps. kill him, get loot +2 extra skill points HUZZAH!

[b]Overall Rating: 10/10[/b]

[b]Why I gave this rating:[/b]
I really wish I could go into more detail but all I have left to leave you with is [b]Dr Zed is back baby![/b]"
11726,Yup. Good game. Right here.
11727,funnest game ever played everyone should buy it
11728,One of the best games I've ever played. The only game that really beats it is the sequel. I don't normally like FPS but this is so plot oriented that it can be fun to play alone or with friends. Gorgeous graphics. I played as the siren and had a great experience. It's funny but serious all at the same time.
11729,I keep haveing a crashing problem at t-bone junction.Can somebody help me?
11730,BEST GAME EVER
11731,"""Lock, Load, & Face the Madness Get ready for the mind blowing insanity! Play as one of four trigger-happy mercenaries and take out everything that stands in your way! With its addictive action, frantic first-person shooter combat, massive arsenal of weaponry, RPG elements and four-player co-op, Borderlands is a breakthrough..""

defo recomend this game! :D this game is awesome! the story, may not be complex story but that dosen,t matter as it still got a great story to it where in the past vault hunters have tried and not suceeded getting to the vault so the player is the vault hunter and has to get through anything that gets in the way,this game does have RPG elements 1 being free-roam which is great as yeah there will be still enemies around but your not forced to do a misssion even if you mark it you can save it for later and play the missions in any order you like :) there are 4 main chracters (you can buy DLC characters also) alll of them have different playstyles which is good as people have different preferences with chracters i,ll mention 2 of them, commando(Roland) is the character who uses all the big and small weapons and has a turret which is very useful in combat as you can upgrade it to heal and re-fill whilst its shooting away. the siren (Lilith) uses magic in the game to control enemies in a way so she place them in a spell whilst everyone shoots the enemy. the gameplay is very addictive weather your playing it in single-player or co-op it is more funner in co-op so defo reccomend if your looking for a co-op game and gameplay is also action-packed and the game provides a lot of challange with boss stages and even smaller eniemies and so much more! :D. if you can you should defo pick this game up and Borderlands 2 in sale or not they are defo worth playing and you won,t regret buying it! :)"
11732,"I loved this game, the mix with FPS and RPG, gameplay was great , guns, more guns, and yet more guns.... it this like 500.000 gun in this game :D just try this game.

-9/10-"
11733,Yea cool game back then...borderlands 2 was great too.. fps rpg open worldish but more arcadish than say fallout..yea fun game.
11734,Good game and fantastic plot...There are plenty of reasons why this game deserves to be purchased.. 1.Awesome guns 2.free roam 3.cool cars and cool enemys 4.great for multiplayer 5. Because its borderlands
11735,"Full of bugs, so full of bugs, so many bugs."
11736,asd
11737,i like hte port where shout th gun
11738,Borderlands is one of the great games of this generation! it is a must for people who enjoy shooters and rpg's
11739,"Boring Lands. Aiming was not as good as, for example, Call of Duty. Too many missions, some of which you have to wait for ages before you can attempt them because you are not strong enough yet. Customization has way too many options. If you like straight forward shooters with a mostly linear path and a limited amount of weapons, then stay away from this one."
11740,Still like playing the old boderland game still the best game
11741,"Borderlands combines the best in first-person action with player customization and vehicular combat for incredible layers of gameplay depth. The game features a groundbreaking content generation system allowing for near-endless variety in weapons and item drops. Borderlands allows for multiple players involved in online co-op games simultaneously. The player can at any time to join a game or leave it or continue playing in single player mode. In addition a complex and thrilling story.

All these features combine to form a breakthrough experience that challenges the conventions of modern shooters. Players choose from one of four distinct characters and then win in battle experience and Unmegen added special skills. Many of these skills can be developed through upgrades, so that the player can create his character exactly as it corresponds to his playing style.

83/100"
11742,Better than Borderlands 2.. imo
11743,Possibly my favorite first person shooter.
11744,"(+ over 50 hours - i also played it while offline steam mode)

One of the most enjoyable combats in gaming history ! 
+ Co-op.

Awesome and various weapons. Elemental or special/hilarious effects. Looting. Bosses. Badasses. Challenging difficulty. 

Skills. Hack n slash.
Catchy character-gameplay building (you can respec).

Pretty humorous. Stylish. Impressive world... [ Best intro :) ]"
11745,"Awsome game
"
11746,"I have mixed feelings about Borderlands. The game is okay, I'd dare to say fun. However it can be fustratingly hard to play alone, and it's hard to find people who are willing to play through a co-op campaign (everybody plays Borderlands 2 now). My saves were bugged so I've lost around 12hours of progress and I just couldn't make myself to start again. The first few hours are really boring and tedious. 

I recommend it nevertheless, because If you can find three people to play a co-op it's really fun. I also like the artwork and  humourous style of the game."
11747,this game is so cool
11748,"Borderlands years later and still crawmerax is still Invincible
DAMN YOU CRAW MAGGOTS pushing solo players from the arena before the boss fight even starts...
11/10 would be flung out again by maggots"
11749,"A decent enough game.  Enjoyed how many missions there were, enjoyed the diversity of weapons, and the visiuals were different in a good way (more cell shaded without being Zelda bad).  Vehicle travel adds a quicker pace that's nice and enemies get harder in certain areas as you progress.  I'm not a big fan of enemies respawning if you're gone from an area for a bit, but I guess they don't want you clearing out too much space.  Would have also liked spoken dialogue on the mission selects with a bit more dialogue but that doesn't subtract from gameplay.  Not sure it would warrant another playthrough with a different character.  About 25 hours worth of gameplay with completing all side missions and main mission.  Final Grade - B+"
11750,Boring (sorry ryan)
11751,"Awesome game, the story line is just amazing and you have a lot of things to do, you'll spend a lot of hours here..."
11752,The best shooter there is in my opinion mainly because of the whole free roam setting you are in wich just amazing and cool and you feel the freedom to go and do what you please with minimal restrictions. ALOT of guns which is why i still play this game even to today i still find new guns i have never seen before. Just an amazing game overall and the best part is it is a CO-OP campaign i dont know any other game that has that.
11753,:(
11754,"An excellent mix of FPS, RPG, and humor. Highly recommended! I bought this during the wintersale two winters ago, and sunk over 100 hours into it within a month. Highly recommended!"
11755,its hard.
11756,"There isn't a lot of story here and there isn't a lot of challange either. It's fine if you have friends and just want something to kill time with but it's not something I really enjoyed playing it was just something to pass the time.

This is not a bad game but without 3 other people to play with I think I'd hate hit."
11757,A fun FPS and RPG with Co-op and Multiplayer capabilities.
11758,The start of one of the greatest franchises to ever exist. Borderlands throws you into a fps/rpg combo with four playable characers with thier own abilities and strengths and throws you onto Pandora filled with millions of guns ad thousands of enemies. An immense ammount of content can be found around the game and fill endless hours of enjoyment. 11/10
11759,"A grindfest in which you literally do the same damn thing on every quest. Go fetch this and kill that. Go kill this and fetch that. Sometimes it'll be just one or the other. There's absolutely no variety in this game. That's it. Multiplayer doesn't save it either. The gameplay is the same but only you get 3 others to play with. Gearbox's claim of tons of different, unique weapons is half-right. Except they're literally the same weapon with minor changes in stats. Let's not forget the ending. That was the only thing that kept many people going and yet, Gearbox screws over the player with that awful ending. If you like repetitiveness and have no taste in games, get this. That's right, stay mad Borderlandsfgs."
11760,Best game ever!!!
11761,"Great game, love the rpg elements. Maybe a little too easy? Second wind should only happen once, and there should be more consequences for dying. I feel as if there's a difficulty setting that I'm unaware of. Idk. Otherwise it's a great game.

If you're one who enjoy's playing video games for story though, or you want to play this game to fill yourself in on the story before playing the second one, you'll be a little disappointed. The ending was painfully obvious to probably everyone (I mean, the planet's called PANDORA for flippers sake), and that would be fine, if there was more interesting story to fill in between. 

They make up for this in the DLC though! Soooo good. Definitely recommend getting the DLC, whether you're into story or not."
11762,"One of the best shooters I have ever played, oh yeah and its an role playing game. Very fun game if you enjoy shooters with character development of a rpg then this game is for you! Oh yeah almost forgot, there are nearly a bizillion guns in the game you will (almost never) find two of the same gun. Loads of fun"
11763,"Simply amazing, determined to max out a characters level and fully complete all DLC, playing co-op just makes it even better, already put over 100 hours into this one and Im gonna put a lot more into it later.
The comedy, action and just style of the game has mad this one of my most played games ever."
11764,"Good game. Funny writing, good story, amazing art-style. 5/5."
11765,"Fun game, good replayability, friends help along the way but the FOV is fucking shit and feels somewhat clunky."
11766,"This game is an absolute copy of the minecraft mod called ""Borderlands weapons"" Notch made this game first!!!!!!"
11767,"Great game, great story, and also i learnt more teamwork from moxxi´s coliseums than a entire life in school and university."
11768,So many guns! SO MANY GUNS!!! Also this game is fun. 9/10
11769,"This is one of the best games that I have ever played and I really wish that Gearbox will make a third to up their status as best game designers ever.

In my books this is hands down the best game that I will ever play in this genre of game, along side Borderlands 2 and if 3 comes out then we may have a three way tie.

All in all, Great Job Guys"
11770,"✖ Boring single player.
✖ Not easy to join co op.
✖ Bugs some times make you unable to complete the game.

I hate this game."
11771,"Borderlands is a really (really) good action game with rpg elements.In my opinion it would be best if you explored the game treating it as a rpg and not really an action game like other action fps(like counter-strike or even call of duty games).Can't wait to purchase the dlc's as well in order to completely explore the entire game.
Pros : 1)Extremely fun storyline(jesus christ so much craziness),2)Easy to use customization,skill-trees,skills,3)Rpg elements that motivate you to build steadily your own character,4)Action elements so that even when you finish the game you can easily fight alongside with your friends,creat incredible strategies and have tons of fun,5)Incredible cel-shaded like toonish visuals,awesome musical effects,voice actors and
Cons: I didn't really find and serious con that would make me stop playing the game.Only thing that makes me a bit disappointed is the overpriced dlc's.

P.S There ain't no rest for the wicked ;)"
11772,awesome game to shoot stuff and have fun
11773,"Fun game, especially with friends."
11774,Awesome game!!
11775,"this is a tripple fried egg chilli chutney butty.
red dwarf, look it up."
11776,I waisted 15 fuckin dollars on this game
11777,Used to like it but now their DRM SecuROM is broken and not letting me play it at all. There is no support for it either. What a load of shit.
11778,I first played this game when it came out on xbox 360 and I beat just about every dlc and the entire game. Good enough to buy it again on the PC.
11779,"It took me a while to really get into this game but I am glad I did. The cell rendered graphics are a pleasant change and provide some character for the game. Loads of guns, loot and co-op make this game a blast!"
11780,"So I'm going to make this quick,

  Borderlands is one of the worst First Person Shooters I have played and only a mediocre RPG. The graphics are solid yes, but the gameplay is simply bad. For me an FPS should be fast, at least from a gameplay perspective, that does not mean that you need to move faster than in Quake but the bullets should at least have some impact. From that perspective Borderlands simply sucks, not only do the weapons low damage but the sounds are also quite unsatisfactory.
  From an RPG perspective I have 3 major issues: 
A) The loot is terrible since defeating a huge beast gives you almost nothing apart from money and the weapons you get are usually worse than yours which is a bad thing with the already weak guns and small actual variety of weapons(the game might have many guns but most handle the same).
B) Grinding. Now this is a more personal matter, I hate having to grind. While usually the pace of the game will give you the level and weapons you need, you will probably have to grind at some point of the game.
C)Missions, yeah they just suck. Not much depth, the system of ""go to place A the to place B and the back to A"" is quite boring.
  Besides those major problems however there is more, what exactly you ask? Claptrap. You will either love this character or absolutly hate him. I decided that the second option was more for me. He is a dreadful character and even worse, he is everywhere.
  The last thing I wanted to address is the Co-op part of the game. Co-op is fun when you play with friends that is true, but that is because of your friends and not because of the game itself. The game is still bad, the connection is hard and then there is the fucking in-game voice chat.

6.5/10 AndGeo"
11781,Yup this game is trully my favorite Fps.All those guns......
11782,"Awesome game. If you like Diablo’s loot system and shooters, then this game is the best of both worlds. I strongly recommend to play every character, so you can add replay value to an awesome and epic game. And wait until you begin a second playthrough  with any character. The game will feel new. You’ll see."
11783,Great Game ! Realy good co-op experiance ! Many guns ....few enemies prety cool and interesting ...with funny moments and if you love black humor like me must buy '!!!
11784,"This game is fun, but it is even better when you play with a friend."
11785,"great game 
i rate it a 9 out of 10"
11786,"Very good game. The graphics style is very unique and the game itself is well optimized. If you haven't had a chance to play the Borderlands series yet, it's time you pick it up! A fun shooter to mess around in, plenty of cool enemies, and a ton of neat weapons."
11787,"Revolutionary gameplaying. It a a great way to kill time. The cartoon-esque graphics give character to the game. HIghly replayable. The humor is unique and intruiging. Not the ""greatest"" game but is a last-gen classic."
11788,fun game even if it's a few years old still worth playing
11789,"Don't waste your money!
COZ YOU AIN'T WASTING IT! THIS GAME DESERVES IT.
Really, one of the best open world games I've played till date. Gives me a Fallout like feel with a little comedy. There are over 17k Guns in this game, because they're randomly generated. You can keep playing it. The DLCs are far more awesome combined with the base game. I recommend getting GOTY Version. Borderlands 1 is this epic, I don't know if my epicness meter can accomdate Borderlands 2's epicness!"
11790,"I have a lot of friends who like this game though I'm not really a fan.  I got tired of the task oriented fetch quests and the color scheme of the game.  It is very brown.  I have found that for me, games with a serious lack of color make for a drab feeling of the game.  I do like the art style of the game.  The ""Scanner Darkly"" animation style appeals to me I just wish there could have been more color used.  There are some good fire-fights; it's alwas fun to sneak up on people and kill them and there are a lot of weapon choices.  The people you play with make the biggest difference in how enjoyable the game is for me.  If you are playing with someone you like and have fun with, the game is good to tolerable.  If you are playing it alone, it's just running back and forth, back and forth...get this for me, I need that, there's this thing that needs to be killed...rinse, repeat.  

I dont really recommend the game, but as I said I do have a lot of friends who like it."
11791,Quite literally the best game i've played in a LONG time. Bloody Brilliant.
11792,"this games is fucking awseume all 4 classes are grate but brick is my favrite
"
11793,"A fantastically fun game whether it is playing with a friend in Co-op or on your own it's a game that you can sink a lot of time into without feeling like that that time has been wasted, its an RPG that I really enjoy and for that it should be commended."
11794,"[b] BORDERLANDS + ""The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned"" (DLC) [/b]

Borderlands is called a ""Role Playing Shooter"" [b](RPS)[/b]. It's a excellent balanced mix of RPG 
elements without sacrificing the FPS game play.
Tons of weapons, equipment, levels and more. Huge world with hours of game play to enjoy!

You take on the role of a bountyhunter which has come to Pandora in search of riches.

The game has a post-apocalyptic, almost Mad Max like feel to it. The graphics in Borderlands 
are quite unique and have comic book style looks to them which only adds to the post-
apocalyptic feel. 

Borderlands has so much to offer in terms of game play, rewarding missions, loot, and fun 
multiplayer that once you start playing you won't want to stop. 

[b]9/10[/b]"
11795,foreskin hats for my puppets
11796,Dildos in the ass make me super horny like holy yolo dildo 420 blaze mang.
11797,"Awesome game, well worth buying"
11798,Borderlands- still the most insane and hot rocking Shooter-RPG. Nothing beats 87 Bazillion Guns to shoot everything that moves on the most fucked up planet ever.
11799,"Borderlands is a game about loot. You want to find the Vault. Why do you want to find it though? For loot. There's a secret area  over here, what does it contain? More loot! Guns, shields, class/grenade mods, all different kinds of loot. Keep this in mind when starting to play Borderlands or it's sequel. The gunplay feels a little bit iffy sometimes, but it works plenty well enough. The main issue is that the game treats every bullet you fire as a really fast projectile, so sniper rifles aren't as incredibly OP as you might think at first, but they're still one kind of gun you're very likely to have on every character you make.

Speaking of characters, you can play as one of four classes, each with a different action skill and skill tree. Berserkers have. well... Berserk. They start healing a lot, and opt to punch things instead of shoot things. It's a great skill to just pop in a safe place and heal up for free, and it's always fun to just go on a bloody rampage with it, but be wary of charging into too many gun mooks with it. As far as skills go, the berserker is mainly a tanky brawler character who revolves around getting up close to soak up the damage for the rest of your team while still making a dark red mash of your enemies up close with his action skill. His Berserk tree is all about making Berserk more effective, making Berserk's cooldown shorter, increasing your sexual endurance. However, if you want to Berserk all the time, you need the beefiness that his Tank tree offers, It's all about making you tougher and making enemies do less damage to you. The last skill tree is Blaster. It's mostly based around explosive damage and Rocket Launchers, which are meant to be the Berserker's ""choice"" of weapons. However, either do to an error in the game, the port, or maybe i'm just using them wrong, rocket launchers are incredibly underwhelming, unless they have a powerful elemental effect tied to them, mostly ones with x4 of an element. The only time you'll ever really get any real use out of explosive damage in Borderlands 1, maybe outside of grenades, is when you get lucky enough to find a weapon with a rare attribute that changes it's bullets to rockets, and even then the unreliability of those weapons will likely make you replace them somewhat soon after. It's possible you'll be able to make explosive damage worthwhile with this skilltree, but the points you'll use to get to that point are much better off used in the other two skilltrees. However, respeccing is cheap in this game. Really really cheap, so feel free to experiment and prove me wrong! Also with all of the DLC and a patch that was put out at some point, the maximum amount of skillpoint you can ever get on a character is 69, so this tree will likely get some use late-game just to make these weak weapons more reliable and make your grenades more awesome.

 Sirens can phasewalk, which basically makes a shockwave around you, damaging enemies and making you invisible and fast for a few seconds. Use this time to move up to someone and melee them to make another shockwave, bringing you back to normal and repositioning yourself. It's much more powerful once you have an elemental effect added onto it through elemental artifacts you find, but even at it's weakest it can save your hide in a tight spot. The siren's skill trees are Controller, which is based around messing with your enemies, mostly by Dazing them, making them slower and making them aim like a Stormtrooper. Next is the Elemental skill tree, which is based around doing lots of elemental damage and decreasing the amount you take. The last is Assassin, which is based around letting you phasewalk in to get an easy kill on an unsuspecting enemy, and using the momentum from that to wipe out the rest of the crowd while getting to your next Phasewalk faster.

The Hunter class has Deathwing, his pet bird who will fly out and attack an enemy, along with a number of other things, depending on what skills you have. Deathwing is fairly weak early game, but he/she becomes a force to be reckoned with  later on. Also, a note on using Deathwing well, she has a tendancy to fly around in circles like a moron if you aren't looking at something for her to target, so she's not very good for tossing out from behind cover. This got infamous to the point that they make fun of it in Borderlands 2. Deathwing is still nice to have though. Anyway, the hunter's main focus is sniping, be it with Sniper Rifles or Revolvers. His Sniper tree is just what you'd think, making him wreck faces with Sniper Rifles. However, a word of warning, sniper rounds are capped fairly low due to how powerful they can be, so don't forget to have good weapons of other types to boot. However it's an amazing tree if you're playing with other people since you can stand back and melt the enemy opposition. Rogue is the tree based around Deathwing, and making her into a killing machine, while also making you get more loot for your trouble. This is a great tree to use for solo play, since it can keep you alive and give you ammo you might be in need of, and more loot is never a bad thing. His Gunslinger tree is a somewhat general tree based around critical hits, and giving you the chance to get random crits (under different names, like ""killer shots"" so they don't trigger crit bonuses)

The Soldier has the Scorpio Turret, which basically works like a decoy that does damage. It's not very powerful on it's own, but it does set up a very temporary spot for you to regroup and attack the distracted enemies. It's more useful than it sounds, don't worry. Infantry is a skill tree based around making the Soldier and his turret more deadly, and making him able to use it more often. It's fairly straightforward, and while I wouldn't put all my points into it right away, it's certainly worth easing into over the course of your playtime. The Support tree is all about making the turret work as a mini resupply station. some skills let it give you ammo, and there are some general defensive skills to help you get a foothold in a rough situation. His last skill tree, the Medic skill tree, is just what it sounds like. It gives you and your team a lot of different ways to get healed up, from a healing aura around the scorpio turret, to being able to heal teammates by SHOOTING THEM. Just keep in mind that some of these skills will be useless in a solo game, so if you want to play a support soldier, make him a seperate character instead of trying to shoehorn in some great skills into a character that can only use them occasionally when playing with other people.

Now for a big issue, is this game better or worse than Borderlands 2? It's not such a simple question. Borderlands 2 has more solid gunplay, and much better presentation and characters, however Borderlands 1 has a better loot system, and it's a fair challenge to solo players as long as they're willing to put in the time to get better at the game and put together a good build, whereas Borderlands 2 has bosses similar to Crawmerax that are nearly impossible to kill solo without an extremely specific build, which leads into my next point. Borderlands 2, while it does have room for different builds in it, mostly has specific skill combinations that are simply better than the rest, which is made worse when most of the legendaries seem built to work with a certain playstyle, especially the legendary class mods, which, to my knowledge, always give boosts to the same set of skills. And it's not that Borderlands 1 doesn't have skills that are just flat-out better than others, but it doesn't force you to use them late-game. You can have a weird build that doesn't focus on anything, as long as you have a few specific skills for late-game effectiveness, such as Tresspass on the Hunter. Also, BL1 has a more fair loot system, not based all around legendaries like BL2. Sadly, character limits cut this last point short. I suggest BL1 over 2 overall."
11800,"Borderlands includes character-building elements found in role-playing games, leading to Gearbox calling the game a ""role-playing shooter"". At the start of the game, players select one of four characters, each with a unique special skill and with proficiencies with certain weapons. The four characters are: Roland the Soldier, Mordecai the Hunter, Lilith the Siren, and Brick (a Berserker) ""as himself"". From then on, players take on quests assigned through non-player characters or from bounty boards, each typically rewarding the player with experience points, money, and sometimes a reward item. Players earn experience by killing foes and completing in-game challenges (such as getting a certain number of kills using a specific type of weapon). As they gain levels from experience growth, players can then allocate skill points into a skill tree that features three distinct specializations of the base character; for example, Mordecai can become specialized in sniping, gunslinging with revolvers, or using his pet Bloodwing to assist in kills and health boosting. Players can distribute points among any of the specializations, and can also spend a small amount of in-game money to redistribute their skill points."
11801,"The original Borderlands game came along when the FPS genre really needed a kick in the rear to keep going; markets were over-saturated with military shooters and multiplayer-centric game modes. It was coming to a point that there was nothing new, and it seemed that all ideas had been exhausted. Enter Borderlands, a shooter that blends the genres of FPS and RPG into one massive open world rodeo filled with explosions, quirky characters, a decent story, and lots of humor. Let's also not forget the ""bazillions"" of guns all of the commercials touted, as loot also plays a major factor in this release.

The main premise of Borderlands is that you, a fortune seeker, arrive on the planet of Pandora in search for a mysterious Vault. Nobody knows what's in this Vault, but rumors of riches and amazing loot are abundant. After stumbling upon the small town of Fyrestone, you begin to receive transmitted instructions from a mysterious woman known only as the Guardian Angel, who will help guide you to your final destination. Along the way, you will meet charismatic allies such as the little robot companion Claptrap, doctor Zed, and ammunitions vendor Marcus. You'll also meet your fair share of bosses, like good ol' Nine Toes and Mad Mel. Beyond the basic plot, character banter and quest descriptions fill the void.

Originally, Borderlands was the first game to make use of cell shaded graphics on a large scale. Its overly cartoony/comic book style made it instantly recognizable; it still does today, although all three of the series entries have used the same model, which has been slightly upgraded over time. In retrospect, this debut release does look a little bland, especially in comparison to what came later on. Most of the areas are arid deserts, and generally speaking the entire world is filled with hues of brown. Though that's what Borderlands is all about; being set on a barren, post-apocalyptic planet in the distant future. That's not to say that the visuals do not get dull after a period of time, however. 

In terms of gameplay, there's a great balance between both FPS and RPG genres. There's a leveling system, and with each level gain you can place a skill point into a three-branch skill tree. There are a total of four characters to pick from, each with their own specialization and with their own special power. Additionally, the more you use a certain weapon type, the higher your proficiency grows for it. Loot includes randomized weapon drops, which can vary in both statistics and additional damage elements such as fire and electricity. Guns, shields, and grenade modifications also come in different rarity types, much the drops from titles such as Diablo and World of Warcraft; White is Common, Green is Uncommon, Blue is Rare, and Purple is Legendary. This type of loot system ensures that no matter how many times you play through the game, you're always going to get different loot and therefore a slightly different experience.

Despite Borderlands having come out in 2009, a whopping 10 years ago at the time of writing, it's a game that you just can't get tired of. You'll end up coming back to it over and over again throughout the years, despite how vanilla the gameplay is compared to its predecessors. There's just something completely addictive about it, whether it's the gameplay, memorable characters, witty content, or a combination of it all. It's easy to spend a minimum of 20-30 hours going through the main campaign, and all of the DLC can easily carry you over the 40-60+ hour mark; though those are reviews for another time. That being said, it's hard to justify paying $21.99 CAD for Borderlands in 2019, especially when it's not even a Game of the Year edition and all of the DLC is extra. It's best grabbed on sale, but you'll be sure to get your money's worth even if you do succumb to the base price.

11802,this game is old but fun:)
11803,One of my all-time favorites!
11804,"Guns, Guns, Guns!!!! The FPS for MMO Loot Horders and Death Obsessed Lunatics Everywhere! What u waiting for?"
11805,"Predecessor to Borderlands 2, if you loved BL2, have played all the content, and are just begging for more, well you should already own Borderlands. If you're new to the series, borderlands 2 is the better game, and you don't need to play the first one to enjoy the second. Give two a try before this one. The borderlands PC port is also pretty poor, if you want to try it i'd explore a console option first. And that's coming from a hardcore PC gamer. Having said all that, it's still a very fun game. If you don't mind doing some tweaking and maybe running 3rd party p2p software to be able to connect to your friends, give it a shot."
11806,"I find this game one of my favorites, but unlike some people I know, I find it to be less good than the second. Both are worth playing so, GET IT!"
11807,Still mint...
11808,Better than BL2.
11809,awesomeeeeeee......
11810,This game has many missions and weapons too.
11811,was not a land of borders. big letdown
11812,"I love games with humor, from the old style point-n-click adventures to the RPGs that have you rolling on the floor.  I never was a big fan of first person shooters, but I love borderlands for its nonstop comedic nonsense and comic book style graphics.  It's a non stop ride through a post-apocalyptic theme park of hilarious action as you search pandora for the vault."
11813,"Best combination of FPS-RPG, great story, funny characters and quotes, action packed and filled with exciting moments especially in the DLCs. Definitely recommended, a lot of replayability, and like Scooter would say: ""GET YOU ONE!!!"""
11814,"Very stylish FPS, lots of fun and well worth a buy for FPS fans."
11815,This game has been a lot of fun and very addicting.
11816,First of all got this game during winter sale for 7$ which is the best deal you can't really find anywhere else.This game is damn good and fun to play.
11817,It was fun for a one time play through but I'll never buy more releases of this game.
11818,Not bad fun for a while to upgrade weapons and beat bosses
11819,a very good game much better than the second one in my opinion
11820,Borderlands has that cell shaded bad ass feel that I love.. the added pop... The love of numbers flying off your hit foes was always acsthetic to me. 8/10 for when I played ... TOO many weapons!!! lol
11821,I have loved this game since i bought it for the PS3 and now i have all the dlc and i am still discovering things i didnt know about this game a great game cant wait for number 3
11822,Kill skags and bandits. 9/10 will swag again
11823,Very good game. Entertaining FPS.
11824,"Shotgun revolvers, shotguns that fire rocket launchers, rocket launchers that fire several rockets at the same time. Man, this game has got all the guns!

It's the sheer variety of guns that drives the gameplay in Borderlands, that's 50% FPS and 50% inventory management simulator. The quests, whilst delivered with some humorous fluff, are standard-fare MMORPG types of ""Go here, kill X amount of the thing"" or ""Bring me back Y amount of animal tails"" that generally exist to faciliate in you shooting things. Unfortunately, this doesn't really change throughout the game, apart from the infrequent ""Go kill this boss"" missions which have you rampaging through a linear environment, but as you move through the world of Pandora, a plot does eventually begin to form and will drive you through the final few areas that are a little more interesting than the earlier ones.

The world will probably make or break your enjoyment of the game as the variety of ridiculous guns you amass along your way are all very satisfying to use and apart from the odd combination and those of lesser qualities, are generally all useful. The problem, if you see it that way, is that the world is one giant dust bowl. For me, I liked that it had this one, constant, drowning feeling of being on this crappy planet, where the greatest resources are dust, sand and rocks. Whilst the environments remain similar for the majority of the game, they're different enough that it prevents me from getting bored and quick teleportations and a speedy vehicle do help to get you to where you want to fairly easily. While enjoyable solo too, especially as a heavier damage dealing class, there's extra fun to be found in co-op, as different classes lend each other assistance and you can move together through the empowered enemies.

If you can survive the world and possibly some bad luck with random weapon drops, if you like shooting, random loot games and getting powerful, Borderlands is there for you.

DLC:
General note - once you finish the main story, you have the option to commit to a NG+. It can be easy to out-level the early stages of NG+ by playing through the DLC, making both the NG+ and the DLC very easy and with little chance of upgrading. 

The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned - Whilst the AI in the stock game is generally pretty simple, it's literally brainless here. There are few enemy varieties, but the new areas to fight in are mostly different and it can be completed in a time-frame that feels just right.

Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot - Arenas! Solo, it can be pretty challenging and perhaps a bit dull especially as item rewards are pretty pitiful, but it can be fun for a few runs. It particularly shines in co-op, but other than for saying that you've completed a certain stage, there isn't really too much to it.

The Secret Armoury of General Knoxx - Possibly the best content in the entire game, this DLC package offers some fun questing, vehicles and weapons to amasss in environments that are fresh and great to explore in.

Claptrap's New Robot Revolution - Whilst adding new areas like Knoxx before it, this DLC has you fundamentally refighting a lot of the same enemies under some thin premises, especially in certain cases. Its plot may be crazier than Knoxx's, but it's also less engaging. Overall enjoyable, but a let down after Knoxx.
"
11825,Borderlands is a mix between diablo and fallout. I have had issues with it on my system due to Windows 8. However with compatability mode enabled it seemed to quit freezing up. All in all its a great game and a review is not really needed. But replaying this again is something i'll have to do.
11826,"Imagine Fallout 3 with more action and a lot of ammo to waste and less talking! Borderlands is a fast pased action game that allows you to shoot people in less than 5 minutes since the start of the game, I really like its cartoon graphics"
11827,"A true example of shoot and loot, as they have branded it. While it lacks the plot and comedic highs of the sequel, its fantastic DLC and better balance make it a definite buy, possibly better than the sequel."
11828,I thought there was going to be 6 million [i]different[i/] guns :(
11829,"Must have, le jeu est fun, graphiquement génial et impérissable!"
11830,A game that has truely surpassed World of Warcraft as the most grind intensive MMO of the decade. Best Grinder 2004-2015.
11831,You get to shoot dogs. 10/10
11832,"Great Game.  Played it again recently and It brought back memories of the Siren I had.  I put soo much time into her. Maxed out all of the weapon types.  Then the save file got corrupted...  RIP

10/10"
11833,"When something is called Pandora, you can bet your marbles something bad is going down.

For those of you who are not so well versed on the subject of Greek mythology, Pandora was the name of woman who was sent to earth by the gods as punishment for their disrespectful actions. Pandora was moulded by the smithgod and endowed with all the desireable traits anyone would want in a person. Lastly they gave her boundless curiosity. She was then given a box (or an urn depending on your textbook) and sent to earth with the simple message to never open the box. What was in the box you ask? Well...despair, terror, disgust, disease, death, pain, agony, greed, lust and lastly: hope. Pandora opened her box and the world was made miserable and the only respite was the tiny bit of hope at the bottom. 

Now that we have a context, can you image what is hidden on a planet called Pandora? Há! Wrong! It's guns! Guns and bullets and rockets and bullets and bullets. There are so many bullets on Pandora you'll be wondering why people are still paying with cash when you can get bullets and guns from everywhere. The whole point of the game is to open a mythological vault (Pandora's Vault. See where this is going?) On your way you'll be beset by all manner of horrors and fiends. So it is nice that you can pick up guns everywhere and share your bullets with everyone. Obviously I meant: shoot at everyone. Stuff gets a bit blurry after a while cause the game is so vast, so huge, you'll be dragging yourself from one end of the planet to the other over and over again, and everything looks the same. This is my chief complaint with this game: It is huge, but doesn't offer much in the way of streamlining. There is some fast travel possible, but only from certain places. You can also rent cars, but arbitrary barriers stop you from driving them all over the place. So if walking is not your thing, steer clear. 

However, if hearing the screams of bandits, as they dissolve into a sloppy pile of green goop after you shot them with a round filled with acid then you are in for a delicious treat. Borderlands drops a lot of weapons. You can compare and contrast to find what suits your class best and go to town on people's face with it. Zap 'em. Burn 'em. Melt'em or Blast them into tiny bits. All off course accentuated by delicious screams of pain and horror. What do you mean ""thats grim?"" That isn't grim at all. That's life on Pandora man. You better get used to it, cause you'll be doing it a lot. 

A funny thing about how the game presents itself is its classification system. A normal wolf-like enemy would be a normal wolf. A big one would be an Alpha Wolf, and a giant, burning and barking monstrosity would be a Badass Wolf. This trend developes, and it makes it easy to gauge what you can deal with, and what will certainly kill you. Dying then triggers a short moment where you can save youself by killing anything on the screen to prevent a hefty ressurection fine. Of course, you can mitigate all of that with the help of some friends. 

You can play the game with up to three friends at the same time. Everyone helps both eachother and themselves when completing quests. However, don't think it is weird to have all out brawls over who gets the good loot. It is a veritable melee of conficting interests that will inevtitably result in the death of many enemies who simply stood in you and your friends way of riches and glory. Unfortunately, the game is connected with an archaic netcode, to actually getting together might be a pain. However, there are workarounds, but it would have been nicer if it would have worked straight out of the box....

Pandora's Box! 

I am ashamed for making this cheap pun."
11834,"This game is pretty awesome to play with friends. Graphic style is snazzy, and it appeals to my MMO-ish side with all the quests and character progression. Definitely worth a pickup, though now you'd probably be better served with the sequel."
11835,SEA SICKNESS.
11836,"This game is not like any other Shooter, it mixes with RPG-like elements to create an ultimate gaming experience. I love the cartoon-like environment and the story about this planet of Pandora. Even if you beat the game, you can do it all again with harder enemies and better loot and I certainly did it because it was so fun. This game is one of my all-time favourites and for the sale price it was totally worth it.

I would recommend it to any gamer."
11837,"Had this game for 360, got it on sale during the winter sale ! .. Steam is just as awesome as this series!"
11838,"Great game, lots of fun and replayable. My only beef is that there's no Mac port on Steam; don't really use my PC too much anymore."
11839,This game is alright for me because I don't have friends to play with on Borderlands but I still had fun with randoms. I'll give it a 7/10.
11840,A intuitive to play FPS that looks and feels like a Top Cow or Dark Horse comic.
11841,The prequel to yes.
11842,its awsome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11843,verry good game :)
11844,"A little slow to start. At first, I wasn't sure I'd like the game. But soon after reaching Level 5 (which is not too hard to get to) I started having tons of fun. I can see what all the hype is about, and I can't wait to play the sequel. Man, I haven't even finished the game yet and I can't wait to see where this goes. Play it, buy it, get your hands on it if you haven't already. You won't regret it."
11845,"Good game, but not as good as Borderlands 2.

That's all.

:-)

Edit: but the intro and exit songs were better in Borderlands."
11846,"Overall 3/5

Lots of guns! Lots! I’m usually not a fan of RPG games, but this one doesn’t feel all that much like an RPG. Lots of shooting! There isn’t much to the story in this, which is one of the only drawbacks. Character customization is limited to changing colours of certain items. Love the cell shaded art style of the game, and the variation in weapons. Definitely a good game, and a required precursor to the sequel!"
11847,Great game!! Totally enjoying it!!
11848,"Borderlands has boiled the basic mechanics down from a Diablo-style loot system and inserted them into a cartoonish and fun overworld populated by psychos. The drive and enjoyment here from from constant reinforcement and progression. Every single bullet pushes you further up the skill tree, giving you new perks and letting you cause damage or havok in new and interesting ways. The four classes can all use any of the weapons in the game, though the skills complement some combinations more overtly. The bosses are generally challenging enough to be fun, and the penalties for death are annoyance but not frustration. Nearly any encounter can be overcome with enough thought and preparation.

The game does get repetitive at points, and there are a few too many quests that tread into the fetch 10 pelts territory that MMOs are so fond of, but if you can slog through that it is well worth it. And if you can bring a friend along, you will hardly notice this anyways as you push to the front and squabble over who needs the gun with exploding fire bullets more."
11849,"morning,
gimmi moar BORDERLAAAANDSSS'!¡!!

say goodbye caroline.
goodbye caroline."
11850,"Epic game! Get the full edition discounted if you can, it's very fun either for solo-ing or in coop. Crazy humour everywhere."
11851,i bought this game and it wont even fucking start. Preparing to launch biggest lie ever.
11852,this game makes me wanna bobble walk while screeching
11853,One of the best games ever love the fps rpg. the art and everything about it
11854,good game to play in single or multiplayer
11855,"Woo-Hoo!

No really story to follow here, but a cool art style and really fun combat!
LOTS OF LOOT for you loot whores (like me)!"
11856,"This is a rock solid game, that is a kick ass shooter with some light RPG elements to it. The guns are crazy and varied beyond any other game. The characters too each have their own unique skill sets that let you play the game different from one another. A must have for any game collection."
11857,"This game just keeps me coming back. Its gameplay is awesome, with so much variety in the weaponry and enemies which make for a game that feels a plays differently than most shooters. I also love the RPG elements to it aswell. I would recommend this game to shooter fans, RPG players and anyone looking for something new.
"
11858,awesome game try it
11859,"This game don't leave [i]rest for the wicked[/i]!
Now seriously this game don't let you sleep for 2 or 3 or maybe more months."
11860,Very good game
11861,"more like BOREDerlands because this game is fun with your friends 
7/10"
11862,"VERY GOOD.

11863,"+nice, interesting graphics
+17+ million weapons
+funny gameplay
+nice coop + multiplayer

-serious bug on playthrough #2
-second playthrough is getting boring
-story ending is dissapointing"
11864,"Had a fun time while playing co-op with friend but i gave up after some time.
Tonst of weapons and so but its too repetetive... which i don't like much - lost my interes for keep playing it"
11865,"At first I could not get into this game, I kept seeing it as a straight FPS, which made it mediocre.  The trick though, was to realize that this is an ARPG FPS.  The difference being that ARPG are expectedly filled with (mostly) pointless looting, repetitive quests, and the obsessive inclniation for finding slightly better, but mostly similar, weapons.  Under this light, Borderlands takes a whole new life, scratching that same itch that ARPGs do.  While still repetitive and slow at times, it is still a very fun and comforting game, as your brains numbs and you willfully click forward knowing that its only a couple more enemies till your next level up.  Also, the Co-Op is fun."
11866,"This game is quite cool because of its idea. A combination between FPS and RPG like never before. Nice cartoonish graphics. Gore is there, if needed too. Good humour and a very fun environment because of that. It provides a good number of gamehours combining FPS action with loot-hunting and nonlinear questing. Main quest is interesting but a pretty boring ending . DLCs are a must to play too because of the quests and dialogues which are very very fun!!! :)

I never understood the playthrought mechanics but nonetheless playing the game ONCE then the DLCs afterwards provides a very rewarding experience."
11867,i dont remember if it had as  many memes as the second game
11868,The recent release of this game on ps vita is tremendus and i would like to see the cross save ability to be used from the ps vita to my steam account.
11869,"It is fun,smart,wonderful and well made Animated FPS.
I love it.It's absulutely fun,you will never be bored even in single mode,cause i think coop is the best :D"
11870,"The Borderlands Series is one of the best games i have ever played yet in my gaming life!Borderlands 1 is one of my favorite games on steam, even though i only have 30 hours the game is still awesome, so who ever reads this, please buy this game and support the creators. Thanks :)

11875,"Ahh, Borderlands. A loot-and-plunder shooter game, very addictive, what else do I need to say?"
11876,"This fun title had me laughing before the end of the title sequence.  The characters are goofy.  The weapon play is satisfying.  There is a class for most play styles.  The desert environment can get a little repetitive and the interface for setting up multiplayer games is pretty terrible. However, this is a blast to play with friends.  The DLC mission packs are pretty good value as well.  I have put over 50 hours into the game and find it a great value for the price."
11877,"This game is A+

Gabazillions of weapons.

Beautiful environment to explore, it's huge!

Blow the heads off of those ""freaky little maniacs"" with shotguns!

They are dangerous, squash them quickly!!

Haha, MUST PLAY. NOW."
11878,"Good, but doesn't age well and Borderlands 2 is overall an upgrade that almost makes this game obsolete.  Play the game for the story and background."
11879,"Great game!
It's always nice to get a new weapon that help you to get more kills faster!

Great combinaison of RPG and FPS!"
11880,"""9 Toes. (Also, he has 3 balls!)"" It's like a MMORPG but with guns!

8.3/10
Meh, I really don't understand the hype people think about this game besides it's humor."
11881,"An amazing game with a great atmosphere. The storyline is great and there are a lot of optional missions to do. The downside is, however, that the most optional missions are very repetitive after a while. Playing with friends (4 players max.) will make this game more fun, however playing solo is also loads of fun. I can recommend this game if you don't mind playing some repetitive missions for the sake of an amazing game."
11882,Just play the game... U will see why we love it ;)
11883,"zzzz....
z"
11884,Amazing Game
11885,"I've played though the story twice, first time with a friend second time single and near the end with the same guy and i'd have to say it is a lot better with somone else or a group of people.
Good game."
11886,borderlands is a fun and entertaning game
11887,Over two hundered billion guns... Less than zero fun.
11888,"Want a game that has you constantly doing something? Do you want to loot guns? And I don't just mean loot. I mean LOOT. A LOT. Want to shoot sqealing midgets in the face with a shotgun, or blow up turrets and take down the most badass people out there? Buy this. And if you don't get GOTY edition, you just wasted $20. Seriously, stop being a pansy and get the DLC."
11889,Love it
11890,nice game.
11891,"Borderlands is the epitome of shoot n' loot. 

I don't think there's ever been an action game to capture the essence of an RPG so fluidly as Borderlands. With nearly infinite replayability, a random numbers generator deciding your loot for(again) nearly infinite possibilities, and a beautiful, desolate cel-shaded wasteland art-style, those of you who've enjoyed your dungeon crawlers in the past will find yourself enthralled in the first installment of this series. 

For an even more intense experience, and where the real replayability lies, you want to purchase the GOTY edition. This comes with 4 DLC mini-campaigns that introduce new enemies, new loot, quirky stories and an increased level cap! Have fun working your way towards level 69 to take on the first raid boss introduced to the Borderlands series, Crawmerax the Invincible! Play your way through the swamps of Jakobs Cove to discover the terrible secrets behind it's inhabitants! Save Pandora from the Robo-Apocalypse in Claptrap's New Robot Revolution! And just kick some major ass in Moxxi's Underdome Riot! GOTY is where you'll find the meat of your replay value, built upon the strong foundation of the vanilla game itself! 

What the hell are you sitting there reading this for? BUY THIS SHIT NOW."
11892,you get to watch demons do it
11893,One of the better free roam shootem' up games
11894,"Great game. The story can sometimes be difficult to follow, but at the end of the day, it's loads of fun."
11895,"Borderlands 2 is MUCH better.  This one's entertaining for a while, but ultimately dull."
11896,lol
11897,"Hillarious Co-op fun, but little to no replayabillity. If you get your crew all the way through the game, I applaud you.

I think I talk for many, many people and friends - when I say this is the game you've started with your buddies in Coop 10 times, played for 2-3 hours, and then abandoned."
11898,Super fun with friends. Recommend it 100%!
11899,After my first playthrough with Mordecai and Lilith I found myself amazed and still having more to do as the game evolves between playthroughs to match your level and even change some enemies completely. It's rare that a game amazes me the way Borderlands has. 11/10
11900,"A few months ago a friend of mine, who is an up-and-coming nature photographer, decided to spend a day and night alone in the woods outside of our town. She wanted to get photos of the woods and wildlife as naturally as she could for her portfolio. She wasn’t afraid of being alone, as she had camped by herself many times before. She set up a tent in the middle of a small clearing and spent the day taking pictures. She filled up four rolls of film on that trip, but when she went and got them developed she saw four pictures that unsettled her, these four pictures were taken from inside the tent, of her, asleep in the middle of the night."
11901,If you're looking for a good game to kill time this is the game for you.
11902,"This game is pure fun.  Pandora, the planet setting, is a character on its own."
11903,fun game
11904,"This game is amazing, you can get lost in all the mission"
11905,TOO UCH FUN!
11906,"If Diablo, Quake, and Redneck Rampage met up and had a love child, Borderlands would be it's awkward yet perfect child.  It has just about everything everyone loves from those games:  TONS of loot, lots of shooting... and rednecks (among other odd outlandish characters).

The game has lots (almost too much) of content, especially after you get the DLC.  My wife and I played up till the mid level 40's and had a blast doing it... We still pick up the game on occasion.

The game is a bit gorey and uses some foul language and has some sexual over tones... so it's not for everyone.  But if you can get over those hurtles (or if you don't care), it's a very fun game that can be enjoyed with friends for a long time."
11907,Good game.
11908,no one shoots my buddies but me
11909,"=)
"
11910,Love the artstyle.
11911,Awesome co-op or single player for anyone who loves FPS/RPGs
11912,"It was pretty fun playing with friends, I don't really like grinding and loot based games like this so it wasn't really for me, I never beat it but I wish I would have at least beat the storyline, I don't like games where I am required to micromanage all the guns and stats."
11913,Great game! Good graphics. Good story. Fun characters.
11914,Is a fun game that you gonna love if you forget to look to much into a perfect perfomance and focus in having a fun experience
11915,Unhealthy amounts of fun
11916,Awesome and fun game. Highly recommend.
11917,"It's a Shoot'N'Loot. You shoot things with guns. Get better guns cus you are so good at shooting things with guns, and you continue on to shoot EVEN BIGGER THINGS WITH BIGGER GUNS.

10/10 would recommend."
11918,"Claptrap is the name of the robot you meet in the game if his name doesn't get you to play this amazing game with insanely beautiful graphics and comical back and forth between the characters then I don't know what will.

"
11919,"What can you say about Borderlands that hasn't been said?  Great game? Check! Amazing visuals? Check! Replayability? Check, and check!!  This is a must own for anyone who love shooters, and has a sense of humor."
11920,"Not as good as the second, but still Amazing."
11921,"The art style, the scavengering for items and weapons, all good.  The one place it falls for me is the story, or the lack of one.  Having come from Fallout, I guess I was expecting similar, and was quite disappointed.  It's a fun game, just not a very good story, which for me is a deal breaker."
11922,"This game is great fun, mixing FPS, soft cell art, and RPG-elements together very nicely.  Great game to lose many a hour in."
11923,"Thias ain't an RPG game, just hack'n'slash 3D multiplayer game, if you don't have friends to play with, don't buy BL1 or 2"
11924,"Pros: 

- Performs on the Unreal Engine
- High replayability due to multiple playthroughs
- Custom classes and weapong choices
- Strong comical dialog.

Cons: 

- Action driven, not story driven
- No minimap

After hearing the constant clamorings of my cohorts (excuse me for the alliteration), I purchased this game on steam four years after the release date. I have been completely baffled by how high-quality caliber of game this is, especially for a 2008 release. Where the story lacks, not necesarily in the plot, but more in the storytelling itself, the dialog picks us up and keeps us laughing. Claptrap, one of the most wellknown supporting counterparts of the game, is endearing and I am extremely grateful for these beloved machines. Borderlands, after having defeated the main storyline, features multiple playthroughs. This feature gives the player option over fighting new enemies in new places, with more guns and more vehicles. However, the story is repeated and the quests are presented in a new way but with the same plot.

Bottom Line: Borderlands is a very excellently crafted first person shooter and the action combat with  countless weapons and enemies frankly make the multiple playthroughts worth it. 90/100"
11925,"Could not get into this game like the second one, but overall it has a nice feel and a certain atmosphere that feels great while playing it. Would reccommend to play this game before the second."
11926,Nice game
11927,Would I recommend this game? Of course I would it's a masterpiece.
11928,Great game lot of mission and great guns
11929,Awesome!!!! My favourite game ever.
11930,Far better than the Second one. Never seem to get tired of playing
11931,"What can I say, the reviews don't lie. This is a great game. I particularly like the cool comic book style 2D graphics. Weapons are vast and awesome as are the bosses. Will keep you busy for many hours. Can't go wrong here."
11932,"very uncommon cell shading art style, innovative shooter looter gameplay, definitely worth the price (always sales too) [ps better than BL2]"
11933,"tl;dr down there
Hey, It feels a bit dated now, but so does Bioshock now and they're both great games. But don't let great sequels overshadow some awesome games. All the stuff you love from BL2 came from somewhere but for those don't know, ONWARD TO VICTORY! So, the game's a shooter with a bunch of RPG elements and an addictive loot system. See, each gun has about 5 different RNG'd peices, each with the chance to have different quality materials. I'm no math major, but the result is you'll probably never see the same gun twice. So, that sniper you tear through the enemy and loved for the last 5 levels? Sorry but you just found an UPGRADE and you love it so much MORE AHAHAHHHAHAHAH.... Oh yeah, classes. So you've got four distinct classes, each who kick ass in their own badass way and each one has three skill trees with awesome perks to help you dominate the beasts, bandits, and aliens that want to eat/shoot and eat/what do aliens do to people? you to death. And hey, if all of that isn't enough for you, YOU CAN DO IT ALL WITH FRIENDS! [laughing like Brick] (and just realized I can keep typing too) Multiplayer is a must for this game. Period. Pandora feels a bit lonely at times, since most of the people you meet are crazy and trying to murder your face, and friends are always good, so PLAY WITH FRIENDS! CAPITALS!! And each of the DLC are pretty good, but if you're gonna get one, it has to be Knoxx. Also, the four classes add replay value too.
Game's not perfect though: Time for me to calm down. So, game is a bit old, and it kinda shows too. Overall, the story is non-existent (basically), but other stuffLOOT outweighs itLOOTLOOTLOOT. Can get lonely at times, helped with multiplayer.

tl;dr- Good game, feels a bit dated and can get lonely soloplay. Cool stuff? LOOT, classes and powers, awesome multiplayer (get 3 friends and have a ball), general badassery. DLC? All are good and worth the price, but get Knoxx at minimum, it's great.
Edit: YO, it didn't take me long to realize that this game isn't pure gold (they lied and I fell for it). Looking at this, I know I'm biased. So look up there ^ and click on the ""Negative Reviews Only"". Dem fools who didn't like the game still have souls, AND VALID POINTS. Check 'em out. I still love this game tho. Oh, and check out SHSD's review. Short, concise, to the point."
11934,"Amazing game, if you're new to it, gimme a ""Holla"" and i'll be more than happy to help ya level up!!"
11935,"Had so much fun playing it but hated the ending...
Maybe they'll uncover the behind story on Borderlands 2.

[b]Lasted Me[/b]: 22 Hours
[b]Worth Meter[/b]: $30"
11936,Get this game its a cult classic.
11937,"Run and gun! Lots of replayablity, lots of guns!"
11938,"Borderlands brought something new to the table and if you like RPG / FPS games then you will definitely love Borderlands. 4 classes to pick from each with different specialities which can be tailored to your liking and a random gun generator keep the gameplay fresh each time, it also has online multiplayer with 4 characters in a co-operative mode (although there is an arena and duels if you want also). Borderlands can be ran through in several hours if you only do the base story, each DLC adds several additional hours and the side quests can easily bring the total to 100+ hours of gameplay. I've completed all achievements on Steam and XBL and can honestly say it's perhaps one of the best games I ever bought.

The game is very lighthearted and some of the characters add a lot of humour to the gameplay, the storyline itself isn't exceptional but you will often find yourself taking up sidequest after sidequest to get that extra loot. The game even features its own inbuilt challenges, allowing for proficiency enhancement with your favourite guns & extra experience for doing basics such as looting, killing, even getting a vehicle airborne for several seconds!

Only downsides are some of the achievements, and the underdome is a little too long, that's only 1 part of the game though and the rest more than makes up for it.

Can't go wrong with this game!"
11939,"Awesome, shoot, kill, get loot! All in a comical style."
11940,"Shoot crazy old men in the action packed game featuring Ben Stiller, who is famous for his work in ""Night at the museum""."
11941,"A FPS with good RPG qualities, and I must say the loot system is a bit messy tho. You will be always changing gear until late game I put about 35 hours into the Xbox version."
11942,This is a great game! I give it four out of 5 Stars. Rockstar never fails to bring good games to the table (except Borderlands 2) and this game is one of theyr'e best.
11943,Do you recommend this game? Yes!
11944,Excellent game!
11945,"A really great game. I have yet to play the 2nd but so far, the first is amazeing, although, I do have to say it is much better with friends by your side. I can't find many downsides, besides some popins, lag on some internet games, and the horrible ""No push to talk"" mic system. Overall, still a great game.  7/10"
11946,game rocks!!!
11947,"Where to start with Borderlands? It is a ridiculously addictive FPSRPG...with limited RPG elements. You pick which character you want to be, then level up accordingly to your gameplay style. Best enjoyed as a 4 player co-op with friends. You can try to join an open online game, but this may end up with people running off without you to level up their own characters faster. Single player is solid, mindlessly repetitive, yet somehow deliciously satisfying. The story is practically non-existant, simply, you're a vault hunter...go find the vault, with a load of side missions attached. The ending is horrifically unsatisfying but then what do you expect from a game with no real plot?
HOWEVER! That being said, I did enjoy this game! It is thoroughly addictive and it's the game I've put most time into in my Steam collection. So if you have friends to play with, it's amazing, if it's just you, it passes the time very enjoyably! Just don't come here if you're expecting a revelation in FPS story telling. Come here for the fun, and the bazillions of guns!!"
11948,"Trust me dont bother getting this game if you already have borderlands 2. Yes this game used to be fun along time ago but its horrible at what it does, sure its full of action and awesome guns but its basically the same thing over and over again same with the guns they are the same guns but with diffrent colours and bullet types the only thing that keeps you hooked is the boss battles which is the only good part about this game. Also the story is s*** and boring and is only fun to be played with a friend. what im trying to say is GET BORDERLANDS 2, trust me your not missing out on anything if you dont get borderlands the only way it connects to the second game are the characters you play as in this game. trust me the second game is AWESOME and is one of my top games of all time. just think of Borderlands 1 as a pre pre alpha of borderlands 2"
11949,"This game is AWESOME! Screw the graphic, its not that bad!"
11950,"One of my favorites, very addictive game which will give you hours of gameplay. You get what you pay for."
11951,HATE
11952,"What can i say about borderlands EPICCCCCCCCC!

Seriously  if u have never played it grab the goty edition u will not be dissapointed"
11953,Very fun!
11954,"Great game! If you play this one, you will HAVE to play Borderlands 2."
11955,"Immature humor, game intentionally tries to screws you over, a-hole characters:10/10"
11956,yes
11957,"This game is absolutely engrossing and engaging.  The special abilities of each class add a delicious flavor and the story line just keeps pushing you ever forward.  The sense of humor in this game more than makes up for the admittedly dated graphics, but if you can look past that, you're in for a FPS treat."
11958,This da Shit
11959,"Story was crap, combat was meh, names were good."
11960,"yea 
"
11961,"The graphics are different then most games, however I found  them visually appealing after getting used to. The games mechanis are solid, and the various weapons you get throughout the game are hilarious to use. Some turn into a gernade on reload, etc. 
The story is great, and the sequel is great as well, so this is a series worth playing."
11962,fun game it is
11963,AMAZING
11964,Very good game and good plot of my opinion and fun to play with friends but little buggy cause its first borderlands but the second one was much better bordrlands 1 has a lot of cool weapons and fun characters to play with
11965,Great fun and fantastic multiplayer
11966,It's not as good as Borderlands 2 but you still shoot crap up with awesome guns.
11967,"The one thing you absolutely need to know about Borderlands is that it's basically fun, addictively fun. Throw in genuinely hilarious writing, characters, hours of mindlessly opening bazillions of supply, mail boxes and looting gazillions of slaughtered enemies to find yet another freaking badass gun and you get an instant phenomenon. And yet, there's CL4P-TP?! INTERPLANETARY NINJA ASSASSIN. This Stuff is Gold!!"
11968,"Abousolutely sick!

11969,"In my opinion, first Border aren't worse than second. It's like an origin. If You like Borderlands 2, You have to try Borderlands to see how Gearbox created greatest mix of FPS and RPG."
11970,"Grab a friend. Heck, grab three friends and play this game. It's easy enough to play with a significant other, and challenging enough to have some fun with experienced players. A strong story line helps keep the game interesting, and DLC's allow for a good replayable value."
11971,"Awsome game, played it through with my friends, really good fun multiplayer and looks beautiful in graphics =D"
11972,Really awesome game
11973,!
11974,"A lot of fun, especially with a friend on Co-op."
11975,"Borderlands is a huge blast to play, especially with friends."
11976,Great game was really not interested to play it but once i did i was glad i did
11977,"Such a great game. Its a little dated, but Borderland delivers the fun FPS Role player that it promises. Play this game."
11978,super awesome
11979,This game is fantastic highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it!
11980,"Love the story, NPC's, ART, gameplay.. everything."
11981,"Excellent game. For interesting story tidbits I'd play this before #2, since a lot of references come from #1."
11982,"First of all, I played this game to find out the backstory of Borderlands 2. (Which is 10x better than this game)
I rate this game a  6/10

I was not 100% satisfied with the game... Espically the ending.
But.. The game has its pros and cons.

Pros:  -Great DLC
          -Great co-op
         -Good Weapons, Characters and Bosses, 
         -The loot that you get after battle
         -The Skill Points

Cons: -Same map style throughout the whole game
          -WAY too repetitive, it's the same quests over and over and over.
           - Same enemies throughout the whole game (not dlc)
           -Quest variety
           - lack of customization
           -bores you
           - and the worst of all... THE ENDING. 
I can't spoil anything but all I can say is that it gets better in BL2.

Overall it is a fair game."
11983,"Graphically good, however all that is done is you run around shooting things. I like reading storyline, when you play with others there is much rushing from one place to the next, so I can't read the storyline."
11984,"One of my favorit games of all time. The hummor in this game is top notch, and keeps you entertained for hours on end. I played this game for up words of 100 Hours on the Xbox and I cant wait to play it again on steam. :P The DLC is great too, but Mad Moxxie is a do once and forget about it DLC :) Hope this all helps."
11985,It was excellent on Xbox - but better now on Steam with a nice big hi-def screen!
11986,No.
11987,First class FPS game with RPG elements. Awesome!
11988,"A great game to play with friends where u can share the loot with them or be a greedy asshole and piss everyone off,also...Lilith mmmmmmmmm"
11989,"Multiplayer felt unfinished and d/c'ed a lot.. Twas unplayable, however the singleplayer wasn't as bad."
11990,One of the best games ever!
11991,"I can honestly say this game improved my life. Had a lot of fun playing through the story and unlocking different weapons and gear. But you seriously can not beat the multiplayer. The Co-operative system within this game is fantastic, elaborate and evasive and it never slows down. Whether you want to play the campaign and progress through the story, or go all the way to the end of borderlands to go loot rare mobs, this game is the game for you."
11992,"You love coop? You love having a fun time? You need something awesome to play? Borderlands! Borderlands!

One of the best coop games ever made. If you want to play Borderlands 1 with friends however you have to do this via LAN Option. You will sort it out."
11993,"Borderlands may be an older version of Borderlands 2, but is just as playable and as much fun as the second."
11994,"Very enjoyable game. After many hours thrown into the console edition prior, I can confirm that this will not dissapoint for those looking for a Fallout-esque feel. The amount of weapons on this game was also unreal, making it unlikely to find the same weapon twice.

All-round amazing game -- 9/10"
11995,Get some friends. It's terribly dull in singleplayer.
11996,"Super fun Shoot and loot game, Many hours of fun with friends via lan or online play. well worth a purchase if you like both shooters and rpgs."
11997,Great game for those new to the gaming world.
11998,Horrible
11999,This Game is a good questing / first person shooter game. I like being able to hook up with friends and quest or play solo. Language not meant for kids. DLC is  good to extend the lifetime of playing this game. Wish it had more DLC but then the came out with Borderlands 2 and change the UI to make it harder.
12000,I love this game
12001,Awesome Game. People should play this. The was the first FPS I'd ever played and I fell in love with it.
12002,"I played BL2 before BL1 and was NOT disappointed in DL1.
This is a great game with the same interest and excitement as the 2nd one.
Lots of guns, upgrading and skills just like the 2nd.

If you played the 2nd before the first, don't hesitate to buy the first! Just as good as the 2nd."
12003,cool rpg game
12004,"Borderlands is a FPS kill and loot game, similar in some ways to Diablo. Great game that at times can get a little repetitive, but never to the point that you are not enjoying yourself anymore. Highly recommend."
12005,nice fps game
12006,I was very skeptic about Borderlands so it took me quite a while to give it a try. But Im sure glad I did. FPS/RPG is mixed very well. I was surprised at how much this game captured me from the first minute. So far I love everything about it and intend to go on to get all DLC and Borderlands 2
12007,"Only 7 hours on record, but that 7 hours was done in one sitting, without moving.......really fun, exciting, and I'm only playing it co-op."
12008,good game
12009,"Definately one of the best RPG I've played in awhile. It's highly addicting and fun when you play single player, and it's even better when you co-op with friends. ^_^"
12010,"i have it and you should 
"
12011,more like gay lands ahahahahahahahahahaha
12012,"not the best/greatest games i have ever played, but they are pretty good...
worth buying, including the DLC's (damn gearbox and 2K for milking the franchise, i wont be purchasing any games from them in the future)...

storyline is extremely limited, or what there is of a storyline (same for borderlands 2)
mostly its a loot/money paradise game... or lootopia.

despite the glitches and invisible walls the game is still fun to play and worth getting overall."
12013,One of the better games that mixes FPS and RPG
12014,such a good game every few months i come back and its all new :)
12015,Its ok.
12016,"well after playin this one, this is well done :D
fun to play with your friend and for me (my gf) lol :D
got the Borderlands 2 already I will play it later on with my gf also :D"
12017,good
12018,"If love rpg for their level and damage you can deal, then you'll love this. Also if it is first person shooters love then you will enjoy it as well. Also love jokes they put in the game."
12019,Really fun. I love using Hunter. Headshots all day. Now if only I had Borderlands 2...
12020,Well... speachless
12021,"You can punch people and they explode and turn into bloodstains.
Get it."
12022,"Pretty amazing and unique game mixing Action RPG elements with the FPS Genre, has a lot of minor flaws but is overall and amazing experience especially when played with friends."
12023,this is one of the best games ive ever played
12024,"The premise of this game is simple, shoot and loot. The greatest part is that this game makes no efford to disquise this fact. Over 2 million weapons, no two the same.  I've now played through this game 3 times, and all the DLC at least once, and found each instance refreshing, and to illuminate some new aspect of this game.

Also, this game is a great Co-Op experience. 

The single greatest part of this game is CL4P-TRAP... As for why, you will have to see."
12025,"I recommend this game, however do not buy game of the year edition it may not work and have not been able to resolve issue."

Cons
-Too many Fetch quests and too much walking back and forth
-Storyline is a bit generic mainly the main campaign
-Environment does not change often and is usually bland at times
-Amount of characters in a large world makes the world all too barren and somewhat boring
-Music is very forgettable
-Difficulty can be at times unforgiving if you go to a certain area before you really have to.

12030,"Great,exciting and damm right weird Game :)"
12031,"You notice how Borderlands 2 has brighter colors on its image?

That's because it's just better."
12032,Def underrated game. Would recommend this game to anyone
12033,"Run around, talk to annoying idiots, shoot stuff, get loot. Repeat FOREVER."
12034,"This game has far exceeded my expectations.

I played it for two hours during the free weekend a while back and thought little of it.

I bought it during the Christmas Sale and I played it for 43 hours straight/1300-ish minutes without even closing it or turning off the PC.

Easily one of my favourite games and I haven't even tried multiplayer.

=============

If I had to pay for this game and DLC now, it's easily worth $80 -- especially considering the developers supported the G19 with its simple but effective applet.

would buy again/10"
12035,Awesome game! I cannot wait to try Borderlands 2!
12036,the borderlands franchise has completely enthralled my faith in FPS
12037,"Good shooter game, great story/ humour!"
12038,"EPICNESS UNLEASHED!! 10/10
Hours of fun and tons of replay enjoyment."
12039,trying too hard: the game
12040,"Borderlands always gets compared to its successor. While I agree that the 2nd installment does a good job of varying the environments and enemies, has a better story (although that's not saying much), and is overall more challenging, this is still my favorite. Borderlands is a game where you shoot things with guns. Lots and lots of them. They fall out of just about everything. In fact, despite statements to the contrary, I'm pretty sure this has more guns than BL2. This is the fun bit; the story and related stuff might be a bit lackluster, but it knows its place and lets the looting take front stage. The DLC is generally good, the music is appropriate, and the menu stays still. Reasonably priced and good for a few hours of entertainment every now and then."
12041,"Borderlands (along with BL2) are two of the best FPS/RPG games available to buy. Endless replayability, a FUCKTON of guns to loot and awesome co-op!"
12042,This Game is amazing the quests are alot of fun and its not as linear as i imagined it would be. the fact that you can choose which missions to do and which to forget about gives you a sense of freedom which i find appealing. Great fun
12043,DA Bomb~
12044,"Good game, I played Borderlands 2 first, wasted away weeks of my life, and had to check out the first one. Shoot and loot is always fun, but the second polishes the formula. Overall a great game, gotta play it, but the second is way better."
12045,This game has incredible multiplayer
12046,k
12047,This game is always a classic for me. I love it!
12048,"great game pure enjoyment,  I don't finish many games but this one I did
loved it.  The story telling was awsome and I couldn't wait for them to pop up."
12049,An extremely fun game with a lot to offer. It's like Skyrim but in a wasteland it's an awesome sci fi open world game. The characters offer multiple playthroughs. If I had more time I'd play it again and again!
12050,"This game is a slam dunk, like they say in football GOALLLLLLLLLLLL"
12051,"Just plain fun.  Plenty of loot and enemies to kill.  I definitely reccommend playing with a gamepad like the xbox 360 controller, I found the keyboard commands and player reactions just a bit off using the keyboard.  Not really much story in the game, but I found the graphic style very endearing.  Took about 20 hours to beat the main story, and now I'm planning to work my way through the 3 main content DLC packs."
12052,Great game cant stop playing!!!
12053,"If your fans of aRPGs like Diablo and Torchlight or you like FPS games then this is the game for you. This game has a unique art style and is full of content; you will likely spend dozens, if not hundreds, of hours playing Borderlands. This is a very fun and unique game. BTW, it is also extremely well optimized for those of you with lesser PCs.

----The only cons for this game is it sometimes gets lonely while/ boring while playing alone, low res textures, mmoesque quest, and the rather easy difficulty level."
12054,...
12055,Great game. A first person shooter with RPG elements. How much better can it get?
12056,"Really fun game.  Might have a little trouble if you have a really fast computer.  I can't seem to get the game to play in my monitor's resolution, and sadly I can't make it into a windowed game, but other than that, it is great!"
12057,amazing.   so much detail in the environment and characters.  simply amazing.
12058,i like how its a game
12059,"I shot a mentally disabled midget in the head with a rocket launcher.
11/10"
12060,Borderlands: Game of the Year is one of the best games iv ever played its got awesome boss battles and amazing guns if you want a game where you don't get board after playing it after a couple days this is what i would get
12061,"Endless amounts of fun. So much to do and although its not the most obvious, there is kind of a semi-storyline. Good for blowing things up though. Highly recommend."
12062,Proper name for this game is [b]Borelands[/b].
12063,:)
12064,pretty Fun rpg shooter great sense of humor annoying little robot companion some pretty dark things out there man check it out
12065,"couldn't stick with it, graphic wise it's good but I didn't enjoy the gameplay style or hype"
12066,"So borderlands, great game with cartoony graphis which I really like. The gun variety is pretty high and there is no linear gameplay so the whole world is open to you. 8.5/10"
12067,Pretty good game. First shooter I'm actually really into.
12068,"If you like adventure games, this one is pretty damn good."
12069,"This was one I skipped but shoudn't have.  Picked it up during the Summer Getaway and just now got around to playing it.  Story falls off at the end, which is unfortunate but it's certainly a good play all the way through.  Loads of weapons and upgrades which makes it feel like an RPG but the management is simple and there's really no need to min/max. Just pick the weapons and gear that look cool and match your play style and go kill some bandits. Will be running Playthrough 2 just to see the ramp up in enemies and gear.  Looking forward to picking up BL2."
12070,"Its a bit too repetitive for me so I didn't like it that much. The quests in this game are pretty boring and the plot sucks. 99% of the game is looting stuff and finding new guns that look like your old guns, but with bettter stats so you can shoot the same enemies over and over again."
12071,"Borderlands is a great game when playing with friends, enjoyed it a lot!"
12072,A shame I didn't buy it sooner! Love it! [strike] SUCKS! [/strike]
12073,Belea jocul !!!
12074,"Awesome game, with endless replayability! Reminds me of playing Diablo and Diablo II ages ago, searching for rare drops."
12075,"An awesome game, with great gameplay, funny graphics and awesome loot!!! Shoot a midget and get 123475315 guns!!!!!!
"
12076,One of the best FPS games with RPG elements. Must play.
12077,Tried out on the free weekend. Fell in love with it. Boght it. Played the whole game. Then got 3 of the DLC to enjoy as well. Then Borderlands 2 went on sale...
12078,If you love looting and punching people in the face then this is your game the whole story line is awesome to me and if you like leveling up and unlocking new things than buy it now what are you waiting for stop reading this.
12079,"Buy it, It is so fun"
12080,This game is a classic. A great blend of the FPS and RPG genres with great loot system. I played this originally on the xbxo 360 but I enjoy it even more on the pc. Definitely worth getting.
12081,"You like shooters? You also like games with loot?

This is your game, my friend."
12082,Mein favorite.
12083,"Excellent game!
It is funny, a good story, good gameplay. 
If you like advanture-shooters it will keep you hours in front of the computer :)"
12084,"The art style is nice and there is a really great intro. After that you are greeted by Claptrap, an annoying, unfunny robot (imo) and the game becomes a comparing gun simulator. Seriously, who wants to continuously have to pick up all your ammo and ruthlessly compare every gun you find; this takes up more than half the game! The quests are also boring: go here shoot this, go there collect that. I do not recommend this game, and I do not understand others enjoyment from it."
12085,Great game works with the rift
12086,like
12087,Ruined my life 5/5
12088,"Welcome on Pandora!

Really very good game with very long gaming time. It's a mix of FPS and RPG which means there is the important level-based system. With every gained level (you have to collect the XPs by doing missions/killing enemies to gain next level) you will get one skill point that you can use to improve some ability in your's character skill tree. This skill trees are different for all four playable characters. It's important to be carefull of your enemie's level - you really [i]shouldn't [/i] provoke an enemy with quite higher level than yours - you simply have no chance against them no matter what gun you have. Yes, guns. There are really almost infinite amount of them - you probably will never found two absolutly identical weapons. And don't forget about the elemental weapons that can for example set target to fire.

In short: just a very good game and if you haven't played it yet, you are doing a mistake."
12089,still interesting after all this time
12090,A really great game if you are trying to get the storyline for borderlands 2  or just want to play the first game before you go to the second
12091,"awesome
"
12092,cool
12093,This game is the shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
12094,I like big butts and i can not lie
12095,Borderlands was really an immense role playing fps game. Overall it was really fun and worthwhile.
12096,"One of the best games of 2009, Borderlands (now, Borderlands 1) is an amazing blend of FPS and RPG. Sure, it has some issues sometimes (randomely getting stuck while driving can infuriate even the most patient gamers), but this game does nearly everything right. Intriguing enemies, cool areas and quests (many hilarious), and tons of weaponry, along with some brilliant voice-acting - you can easily sink hundreds of hours into this game. You also (bonus!) never feel like you're doing quests where you're simply retrieving an artifact from a dungeon or a cave; most of the quests are intriguing and the scenery tends to distract you from feeling like you're doing a ""fetch"" quest. Additionally, the co-op makes this game even MORE fun (if possible) while simultaneously increasing difficulty.

A great game, a must have for fans of FPS, and I even recommend it to RPG fans."
12097,This is a great first person shooter that I played a lot before I started playint borderlands 2.
12098,"This is a FPS with RPG elements, you can gain levels and customise your character through placing points in a skill tree.

The game is quite long but it's fun and it has a diablo style looting component, which means in reality that you get tons of guns but the vast majority of them are useless trash and you'll be using the 1% of drops that is actually decent.

Don't get me wrong though, this game is fun and the price that it goes on sale for these days is a bargain."
12099,"This is a FPS with RPG elements, you can gain levels and customise your character through placing points in a skill tree.

The game is quite long but it's fun and it has a diablo style looting component, which means in reality that you get tons of guns but the vast majority of them are useless trash and you'll be using the 1% of drops that is actually decent.

Don't get me wrong though, this game is fun and the price that it goes on sale for these days is a bargain."
12100,"I just didn't like it. I tried and tried. But, it's just not my kind of game.

edited: ones I tried it with a friend it became a lot more fun so if you are planning on playing it coop this game is great. Do not get it if you are planning on playing it on your own. Only problem I still have with this game is that it has physx garbage software."
12101,"LOVE IT!!! only thing I dont like is the in game navigation, everything else is 10/10"
12102,Me llamo Carlos y me gusta este juego
12103,Such a great game. Beat it on 360 with all the achievements saw it on sale on steam and had to get it. One of the best coop games ever made.
12104,Awesome. And Crazy. Mostly crazy.
12105,why gamespy? why?????
12106,"FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!
"
12107,Another great game. The perfect first person shooter rpg. The only way to play this game is to buy $7.50 GoTY edition with dlc. Another great buy for the mature gamer.
12108,"I started this after I finished the second one. I will say, if you enjoy zipping around in fast cars killing most every moving thing all while listening to humorous diologue, this is the game for you!"
12109,OMG THIS GAYM IS SO GREAT
12110,After you get over how unbalenced and completely god like the solider is. the game is overall fun and better in co-op when you have 4 people who have a common goal and one of them isn't out to screw the group over. the DLC is great and the characters are always funny until you hear claptrap screaming for the 100th time. in which its still gut busting to hear a robot scream for his life.
12111,"Borderlands is an awesome game, with a great sense of humor! LOL I can never get tired of this mindless fun :P"
12112,"I feel like the rpg elements in a shooter was a fairly good idea, but they should have left out the element of not being able to damage an enemy that is a few levels higher than you, despite having every advantage over them."
12113,"This game looked good! An FPS, different classes a different kind of story and look. Yet... it wasn't for me. If you're someone who likes open worlds, or just worlds with people in them that are alive with life. You'll most likely not like this game, the world is dead. You can have friends come with you in the dead world which is cool. With handful of classes to pick from and not much to look at or do. I would pass on this one... I here Borderlands 2 fixes a lot of these issues.

A 3 out 5"
12114,I enyoyed this game far more than I should have. Loved the art style and the mix of fps/rpg and humour.
12115,So much fun in co-op. A must have game for sure.
12116,"BORDERLANDS IS AWESOME!!!! The loot is great,  the characters are hilarious, this game NEVER gets old!!"
12117,"Probably my favorite game. The art style, humor, and music are fantastic. Not to mention, the gameplay is great. An rpg shooter that gives you the best of both worlds."
12118,"Solid gameplay, and actually surprisingly good in single-player. Definitely worth the price, though the sequel is decidedly better in many ways."
12119,"This game is fantastic. It's a hilarious loot based RPG that everyone should play. If you're a fan of first person shooters, give this a try, it has guns galore, enough to please any trigger happy gamer. 
The co-op is fantastic, but don't think its absolutely necessary. Sure its fun to grab a friend and playthrough with them, but you can have just as much fun solo. 
LOVED this game, get it, and then the second."
12120,Gun Potato
12121,Best Rpg/Fps in my opinion
12122,Great game! Highly recommend it. Hours and hours and hours of play time. It never gets boring.
12123,My favorite game out of the 100+ that I have played...beaten it 11 times (maxed 5 characters or 6 don't remember completely. Beat it on xbox a bunch and bought it on pc to beat it again. 10/10 !
12124,good story but the graphics hurt my eyes
12125,My favorite game ever ♥
12126,"This game is probably the best game I could think of playing with at least one friend. Having all 4 characters on max level and did all playthroughs with all dlc I can say you are missing out a gaming experience of your lifetime. You may only follow quests mostly killing someone to please one of your NPC-friends but still. There is a lot of fun in playing this game.
Must Buy!"
12127,"A great title to own. Nick named ""The Diablo of guns"" for a good reason. And now you can get all the DLC with it fairly easy."
12128,"best first person shooter EVER 
"
12129,LOL this game gets better and better
12130,Amazing physics with a first person shooter perspective. Art is almost in a comic sketch feel. Awesome game!
12131,"This is a really great game. This is a perfect game for both rpg and fps lovers, at first I didn't expect to have loved this game as much as I actually did. This game doesn't really get old, it's filled with tons of missions and hours of fun and tons of replayability since theres 4 characters and theres dlc to enjoy too"
12132,"Glad to be done with this game, I was really hoping this game would get better towards the end. Maybe better guns or something, but more of the same thing. Fetch quests,going through areas twice,killing guys several times even after clearing a room. After awhile it became so  tedious I was hoping at least when I got to end there would some kind of payoff, but nope. Only good thing about playing bl1 save me money from buying bl2,glad I got it really cheap,"
12133,neat
12134,"Great game, tons of fun. Great multiplayer. Tons of unique humor.

If you haven't played it you need to fix yourself."
12135,Super fun. Good character variety and co-op. :)
12136,"Borderlands is an awesome shooter, and it manages to be different from other shooters.

The graphics, guns, and characters all seem to be on a different level than most games. The humor of it seems different from other games as well. All of the characters handle well and are fun to play as. It's the type of game that you'll keep coming back to because you can play a different way each time."
12137,love this game
12138,Play this before you play Borderlands 2. They weave together a great storyline that is both robust and mature in it's content. 7/5 stars.
12139,"One of the best action RPG's i've ever played. It has thousands of weapons that never gets old. also has pretty decent dlc. this game also features many weapon types. and leveling up is also one of the main charms. Has those cartoony grahphics like tf2.
What more could you ask for? XD"
12140,"Stylized FPS with RPG elements should be an easy sell to me, and I finally gave in to the hype and tried this. I found: extremely repetitive encounters, tedious repetitive quests, annoying sounds that cannot be turned off, and bugs... so many bugs. 

Most upsetting, and surprising that I didn't hear about it before purchasing, is the disturbing amount of misogyny in this game. This might be the most offensive game I've ever played, and yet it managed to do it without any apparent attempt at humor."
12141,"Borderlands, what can I say, it's a beautiful game. One of my personal favorites and I'm so glad that I had bought it. I recall back to when I was obsessing over getting it, going through youtube to watch gameplay and listening to a couple of my friends saying how much they enjoy it. This is a must have game. The style, the graphics, the enemies, they're all beautiful and one-of-a-kind.

Seriously, play this game."
12142,"Pure Genius

Rage trys but falls short!"
12143,"While the stylised graphics style might not be to everyone's taste, the combination of RPG progression and FPS gameplay are melded together well here. It's been a long time since an FPS gripped me, and this has me coming back to play with the prospect of different play styles, and simple character progression."
12144,Fun when you have friends to play with.
12145,shit ton trillion guns
12146,"Love this game, it may be old but still very good!"
12147,The game looks a bit duller than number 2 but the gameplay feels just as good and playing as the original vault hunters is a nice way to experience how the group started off.
12148,This game just made me want to play it. It's really good
12149,Buy this game right now
12150,"great game and really good missons and lots of them to it is jut endles fun a tun of guns and i like when you first start you get a weapon not like borderlands 2 to good really good game one of my favorats 

##########################  10/10  ######################"
12151,Randy Pitchford sucks my balls
12152,"Best Shoot game, tons of guns and always fun with friends."
12153,Love Borderlands :D
12154,"This game is the best with plenty of missions and action to keep you playing for the years to come. Sadly though the Co-Op feature using gamespy will be ending sometime within the coming years so do not get this game if you wish to play with friends or anyone.

EDIT!!!: Steam now controls the multiplayer for this game so goodbye loneliness!!!!"
12155,This game is a great FPS/RPG title. I've only played single player and had a great time exploring and doing countless missions.
12156,very good but do prefer second game
12157,Fun rpg shooter I'd recommend it to anyone 8/10
12158,"from the trailer looked good, but balls"
12159,The best RPG FPS game on the market. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes FPSs with an awesome Story.
12160,this game rocks!
12161,"A fantastic game, from the very beginning it immerses you into the ambient of Borderlands, plus it's probably the most funny FPS you'll ever see (and that's good humor mind you!).

[b]Graphics: 9/10 [/b] They're kinda comic-like, you get used to it and they're actually quite good, the explosions and the scenery looks great (c'mon who doesn't likes explosions).
[b]Music: 8.5/10 [/b] Very repetitive although good, there's not much variety on the game for this.
[b]Story: 10/10 [/b] Fantastic, can't really say anything else, great storytelling with a bit of humor.
[b]Controls: 10/10 [/b] As usual for FPS the controls are pretty easy to use, just spam that ""R1"" to win.
[b]Gameplay: 9.5 [/b] The RPG elements on the game are great and add some unique mechanics to this game (and the FPS genre), the skill trees are well done and there's enough variety on fights with the additional elemental damage on weapons to really think about which weapon to use best.

[b]Overall: 9.4/10[/b] would ban... errr buy. :P"
12162,"Borderlands is one of my all time favourite games for many reasons. First off, its RPG elements are great. You get to choose the 'class' of character you want at the beginning of the game, and choose exactly which abilities and skills you want as you level up.  You get to choose which sidemissions you want to do, when you want (If you like it hard, do it straight away, or wait a bit so its easier. AND the GUNS, so many guns. the randomness in them are great and theres always the feeling like you have the best gun ever, only to play for another 30 minutes and find your new best friend. This game also has replayability, start as each class member and thats 4 playthroughs, and each one will be very different not only because of the different skill trees, but also due to the different weapons you'll encounter."
12163,"This game is so good that if you don't like it,I think we can't be friends anymore.."
12164,"I probably can understand that someone can like this game while playing it in coop, but as I usually play games in single player, this not my cup of tea...
Aesthetics are nice, but I (and as I search the net, many other people) have problems with eyeballs hurting after a few minutes of play... This is by far the biggest issue I have with this game, but other than that, I don't like that enemies respawn every time I start the game... It's extremely frustrating, because I usually don't have more than 20-30 minutes to play, and there is really no reason to play such game if you're going to play it for less than an hour at least... However, I can understand why they did that...

Then again, RPG part is awful, but that is expected for the action game... If action part was actually better than it is... It is average, at best... I don't like controls, story is... Well, I don't actually see any story worth mentioning and remembering... Loot system, which is probably the most important part is not the best, but it is ok...

After all this, it looks like I hate the game... but I don't... It's ok, playable and I probably think it's pretty nice in coop... I would probably play it more, and even finish it, if I don't encounter strong eye pain while playing it, but the problem with respawning enemies is preventing me from playing it for 30 minutes or less, which is about max before the pain is unbearable..."
12165,"Good time, better with friends."
12166,Borderlands is based on the idea that grinding through hoards of enemies to get better loot is incredible fun.  And they are right.  The story falls a distant third to killing everything you can see and searching around the bodies to see if the game generated a better weapon for you.  Each of the characters you can pick has a unique play style and set of upgrades meaning that you can have at minimum of one unique play through for each character (more if you want to try different builds).
12167,"Very enjoyable, somewhat repeative RPG FPS. I think it would be very enjoyable with 3 friends, but quite good either solo or joining random internet games. Borderlands 2, is only slightly better."
12168,"Was fun at first, then got boring and repetitive. Never picking back up/10."
12169,"Aw yea man, this game is the bomb diggity."
12170,"Lock, Load, & Face the Madness Get ready for the mind blowing insanity! Play as one of four trigger-happy mercenaries and take out everything that stands in your way! With its addictive action, frantic first-person shooter combat, massive arsenal of weaponry, RPG elements and four-player co-op, Borderlands is a breakthrough in RPG + FPS.    (From Description)"
12171,Fun times with the classic vault hunters
12172,"New experience every time you play, and has many resons to be played again. Definitely worth your time of you like FPSs with a story to it."
12173,"simply the best multiplayer sandbox game you can get.

Great artstyle and ton's o' gun!"
12174,good game.
12175,long
12176,My Favorite FPS series
12177,Surprizely I like it
12178,"I think this game is just great I love the enemy ""Handsome Jack"" he is hilarious. The characters are awesome! its pretty cool!"
12179,Great hack'n'slash in a new (and refreshingly cynical) setting. Suitable for casual gaming where you just want to blow up a few heads to vent off steam.
12180,"Borderlands is a simple game: go here, shoot some stuff, collect a whole bunch of loot, and repeat ad infinitum. There is an outline of a story that keeps things moving along, but it's mostly about the shooting and collecting. Given its core simplicity, it makes for a surprisingly compelling experience. The design is good, and makes for a concincing universe, although the colour pallete consists of various shars of grey and brown, which gets a bit drab after a while. The game provides good value for money: I got 28 hours out of a complete playthorugh (completing the main story and most of the side missions), but the experience gets a bit grindy towards the end, so the game could have benefited from being about 20% shorter. Overall, I enjoyed this game, and would recommend it. I'm looking forward to playing Borderlands 2 next, since this is widely held to be the better experience. Since there is not much story to the first game, one could play the sequal first without missing out on a great deal."
12181,"For shoot and loot, button mashers like myself, this is a wonderful game.  Not only do the characters remind me of me with their wry wit and fantastic style, but this game never makes me bored...and my girly side allows ample empathy with the wide range of characters."
12182,Curiously addictive and surprisingly replayable. Unusual graphics lend to the otherworldly experience. Solid campaign with the added bonus of potential multi-player co-op. Put this game in the winners column and make sure it's added to your library.
12183,SImply fantastic. Immersive experience which gets better with every additional friend or stranger you will take on a ride...
12184,"I want to like this game, I really do.
But it just draaaaaags. And especially when you've completed the game. There's absolutely nothing to do."
12185,"100/10, would play again and again  (and have)."
12186,Shoot for loot!
12187,"The Borderlands games are one of my favorites to play. I find that they have endless replay value, and the shoot and loot gameplay is amazing. They fixed most of the issues I had with this one in the second game, such as not knowing which mission is a story mission and which one is a side mission.

Overall, great game, get the GOTY edition for even more fun."
12188,Lub dis gaem!
12189,Gunfest!!! Awesome!!
12190,"I love this game, it's quirky, it has replayability, and it stays in your mind forever after you've beaten it."
12191,One of the best series.
12192,Nice game!
12193,"Borderlands has had me hyped since it was announced through gaming magazines all those years ago, talking about being a fps based Diablo loot game, and it deserved the hype train it got along the way in my opinion. Play this game, play in coop if you can, and enjoy the comedic world and awesome setting, and the MOUNTAINS of loot."
12194,Great cartoony game with lots of action and fun! Great game and get it during the sale!
12195,My personal favorite video game that started a series i can't get enough of and have wasted many an hour both on pc and ps3 that i could have spent being productive to society.
12196,"""it's like christmas"""
12197,Great multiplayer game
12198,[spoiler]1 bajillion guns[/spoiler]
12199,"Got this on the PS3 and now on the PC. Also got Borderlands 2 on the Xbox 360. Best money spend, well done GearBox."
12200,"Besides stating I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The ability to co-op and loot. The story is fine. Maybe a bad ending. But the side stories from the DLC add-on (except Moxxi's) were very good.

I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Worked hard after borderlands 2 came out to 100% this games achievements. 
I would highly recommend anyone to play this game. Its very playable solo, with a friend, or with a group.

Roland, Lily, Brick, Mordecai and our best friend Claptrap - make the world of Pandora a great place to explore, shoot things, and of course LOOT!"
12201,"Tons of fun, limtiless weapons, very comical, and a great story. A must have."
12202,Excelente
12203,"Not sure I would call it a memorable FPS compared to Fallout or Half Life, but it is a great deal of fun."
12204,"One of the original and best whacky shooter. I like BL2 better myself, but I would still highly rate BL1, especially with all the DLC packs in the steam sale. Runs buttery smooth on my bog standard works machine with all the settings up high. No issues so far."
12205,I love this game! it weird because i find it to be almost peaceful at sometimes which i like. BUY IT NOW!
12206,"Loot Crazy Gamers Attention! This game will suit you well!

Borderlands 1 is the game that started me with the whole multiplayer co-op scene. I usually just play multiplayer online for versus modes or mmorpg. But never for co-op FPS team game. This introduced me to a whole array of looting craziness, hours upon hours of running around maps to do quests and having WTF moments with team mates when we go and deal with Boss fights.

If you enjoyed playing the latest Borderlands version (2), then you should definitely try the original. You will feel right at home with it and you will also get to know the characters and the story of Pandora a whole lot more.
Borderlands 1 is a great buy especially if you have friends you can play the game with.
"
12207,One of my all time fav.. Logged in so many hours on my PS3 and im happy to play it all over again.. :)
12208,"Borderland is truly one of the most boring, bland, laziest, and uninspired AAA games in recent history. It is incredibly tedious and offers little challenge, even smaller reward, and almost no satisfaction from accomplishment. Its characters manage to be less than one-dimensional and are forgotten as soon as they are met. Not to mention that the colour palette comprises of little more than three hues; dull, monotonous, and ugly.

Basic expectations are not met when it comes to Borderlands, for example, character's mouths do not always move when they talk. Such a basic part of animation that has been a staple of gaming for decades, yet a game from 2009 can't bring itself to bother with something so trivial. Time and time again you will find yourself stuck on a piece of scenery, slightly raised higher off the ground than the rest of the mess strewn across Borderland's semi-expansive world, which gives it an excuse to snag a corner of your clothing, keeping you in place for a few short seconds. If you're lucky and want to take a shortcut you might even get stuck between a boulder and a cliff face or a fence and a post with no means of escape, all due to incompetent design. Hooray.

There will be times when you become so confused as to where you are that you'll travel in circles as everything and everywhere blends into one giant continuous blurry blob of colour before realising that, without the waypoint guiding you along, you have exactly no idea how you even got here in the first place. Never mind the fact that Borderlands absolutely loves reverting your video settings and keybindings once every few months, regardless of syncing them to Steam, just to keep you on your toes.

By the time any exciting variation comes along, in the form of scenery and enemies, it's almost over. One final boss battle that can be accurately summed up as throwing pebbles at a beached whale for 20 minutes until it explodes and you're done. Congratulations, you've just beaten the saddest excuse for a game in the 21st century. Now go do it again. Lovely."
12209,Gun Management Simulator 2009.
12210,Absorbing.
12211,"thissssss is the shit
"
12212,"Fun game, although those who do not like repetition may get less mileage out of it. Others who don't mind a bit of a grind and love loot and blowing things up will love it."
12213,"+Terrific fun with friends
+Different character classes are equally as fun
+So many different guns Jesus Christ
+Soundtrack is great
+Weirdly addicting

-Grindy
-Not fun alone
-Story is kinda just not there?"
12214,"This is one of those games that can draw you in with the depth in character development. With four different base classes and different branches of skills, the game is what you make it to be. Multiplayer is easy to jump in and out of. Forcing you to rely on the teammates for support. I have spent a lot of hours into my character build and I have to say it is time well spent."
12215,"I love this game to bits. The humour is fantastic and the graphics, though simple and comic like, are nice and well drawn/designed. I can play for hours dipping in and out to complete a few missions here and there or have a mad day long Borderlands spree only remembering to sleep when I drop the controller. 

It does have its floors in that a lot of the questing is very repetative and having to go from place to place then back again then to somewhere else the other side of the world and then back to the place you started can be annoying. I believe these are the only down sides I have to this game. 

Buy it and enjoy people :-)

p.s. I must add that almost all mof my game play, 500+, was on the xbox version."
12216,This game has lots to do with lots of potential but can get very boring unless you have some people to play with.
12217,This was a fantastic game. The dialog is well done and well acted. Entertaining all the way until the end.
12218,Fun game
12219,I rather watch grass grow than play this
12220,Funny as fuck...
12221,This series hardly needs my endorsement but it has it.
12222,"Fun game, always great to have friends playing it with you!"
12223,"[b][u]-Quick Review-[/u][/b]
Borderlands is a First Person Shooter, which has very witty humor, a great story, and at times a very challenging level system. Because this game is now rather “old” (seeing as it’s 2014) a lot of the mechanics and quest-style will reflect that age. But if you can overlook that, you will undoubtedly enjoy this game.

[b][u]-Long Winded Review-[/u][/b]
Hail Vault Hunters!  I will try to organize my review into sections, if you want a short review, look at my conclusion, if you’re interested about a certain part of the game look up the specific section, hopefully this will be useful instead of annoying. I hope my review will be useful to you.
Introduction: (you can skip if you don’t care)
I'm a firm believer in “gamer loyalty”, so I wanted to play borderlands so that I got the bonus stuff in borderlands 2. So I came into the borderlands backwards, started with the second, then played the first.
So naturally there’s a risk doing something like that… you’re basically playing the higher quality game first, then moving on to an older one. It’s like if you played Mario Galaxy and then went back to the N64 Mario games. Analogy aside, you need to appreciate a game for how it plays to play a game in that way, and I do.

[b]Story-Review:[/b] (spoiler free)
Something I have always liked about the borderland games is its story, and weather you’ve played the first or second borderlands, trust me, the story is excellent, the second expands on what has been done in the first, but you don’t need to play the first to understand it! (That is good game design if I’ve ever seen it.)
The story has humor, drama, and twists and turns. Not only that but if you get the DLC you can to continue the fun with some side stories of your favorite (or new) characters in the borderlands!
One final comment about the story, after playing through borderlands, I understood things a whole lot better in the second game, just because you have a foundation, and it give that whole “coming back” nostalgia feeling too it in the second game.

[b]Combat:[/b] [i](pew pew pew)[/i]
I played at least a little bit of each class in this game, but I ended up leveling Mordecai, (Because I tend to prefer the sniper play style), although I played as Mordecai, I found myself testing out many different types of weapons. The initial thing that attracted me to borderlands was the concept of having guns that had different stats and abilities. (And believe me, they have many.)
Choose between a high attack weapon, with terrible accuracy, or high accuracy + low damage + burst fire while zoomed. There really is unlimited potential to the types of weapons out there, the best is when you get weapons with unique abilities like bullet ricochet.

[b]Achievements:[/b] [i](I like achieesements, if you don’t – skip this)[/i]
I know not everyone cares about this in a game, but for those that do, I have soloed most of the achievements in this game however there are plenty that you will need a friend to get. I intend to finish them out, but most of the ones left require some heavy grinding. It’s a very fun game that you get most achievements for just playing through.
Anyone who’s spent much time going after achievements there’s just that point in the game where you’ve gotten all the easy achievements and everything else require grinding out the work or farming until you get those last few achievements. I still recommend this game even if getting several of the achievements is a headache.

[b]Final thoughts:[/b]
Whether you get this game for the shooting, the story, the multiplayer feature, the classes, or the achievements, I recommend this game for anyone who is wanting to play a FPS in a more “quest” oriented story, even if you started out playing the first, it’s not that rough at you to go backwards into the borderlands, you’ll be glad you did. Fair warning, when you start out it does require a bit of work to get the hand of (or it did for me) but you can do it once you catch up in levels and gear.
Best of luck, see you in the Borderlands Vault hunters!

12224,Really immersive. Hours of replayability. Just as good as Borderlands 2. You won't regret it if you love shooters and RPG's
12225,"Great fun to play, quirky but good game play. The graphics are excellent. Masses of carnage!!!"
12226,"Poor story, lots of grinding but funny elements"
12227,"Such fun, especially with friends. Single player is solid too."
12228,Epic! The 1st game that combines the 3d and 2d elements since its released date. The comical environment and the storyline of 4 vault hunters co-op makes the game not boring. Well its just like left 4 dead but shooting aliens and psychos
12229,"A terrible PC port, with really repetitive game feel that isn't very fun.  Also the lack of AA burns my goddamn eyes."
12230,Mojestic Sauce... nuff said!
12231,Really great fun for the compulsive weapon collector.
12232,"Wicked humor, gorgeous design, playability in bucketloads."
12233,"If you haven't yet played Borderlands and you're wondering if it's worth picking up before playing the sequel, rest assured, it totally is. I have beaten this game twice and it was tons of fun. The story is sort of lackluster but you don't play this game for the story."
12234,"Amzing game.  Loved the first one, but this one improves even more.  Fun adventures and doesnt take intelf seriously.  Plus Gearbox does a great job to continue support throught dlc and community codes."
12235,MEGA!
12236,"A fun game, with comical characters and dialogue (although a bit childish). It can get boring pretty fast if played solo. Since this was designed to be played co-op I'm going to give it a thumbs up."
12237,"Oh mah lawdy. So, I've easily put over 400 hours into this game across a couple platforms, and every second has been fun and explosive and shooty(is that a word?)! For the regular price it's AMAZING, and on sale, you can't NOT get this! A MUST have for anyone who enjoys looking for better guns and shooting everything possible. And with the 4 different characters, there's 4 different ways to kick ass!"
12238,This game is pretty sexy!
12239,"Pretty funny comic-like game but the co-op almost never works.

Edit: Recently this game got patched to Steamworks! The co-op finaly works flawless. Kudos for Gearbox/2K for putting time in this 'old' game!"
12240,Very well made and fun game
12241,"This game, although quite old, has given me a great amount of new loves for the rpg/fps genre. Absolutley brilliant in the gameplay and story alike. The creation of this game still amazes me. For anyone who has been told about this game, should defeinitely give a try. MIght be a little lackluster for true RPG fans, yet it action and bits of customizing to your character surely will keep you hooked!"
12242,"So much fun, wish it was easier to connect with friends."
12243,"Borderlands is one of those games where when I tell people that I don't like it, they gasp at me in disbelief.

I understand why people would like it.  Its a humorous game about shooting stuff with crazy guns and looting for more crazy guns.

However for me, I can't get past the first couple of hours because I just get so bored of it.  For the ""bazillions of guns"" that they advertise, they all seem to be the same to me.

You may like it, but I'll pass on Borderlands"
12244,"Great start to a series, fun shooter set in a wasteland enviroment with lots of quests and great loot."
12245,Awesome fun! Fast paced and enough killing and gore to whet anyones appetite for destruction. Insane characters with razor sharp wit.
12246,"Great open world game with lots of potential gameplay hours.  Can be a great experience alone, and even more fun with friends.  Lots of guns, different characters with unique skilltrees, and a superb leveling system that allows for an even challenge throughout.  Want more after the first playthrough?  Do it again, with enemies leveling up to make the second playthrough another fun challenge!
"
12247,"Fun, worth $10 or less"
12248,Truly one of the coolest games I have ever played.
12249,"This is a great shooter, that's for sure. You get a good and often hilarious story along with lots of sidequests, different kinds of loot and intensive gameplay. Not to mention the special graphics that only this game has. However, as I said this game is sort of hilarious, and to some this may be a downside since the game rarely takes the story seriously, so if you're looking for a ""serious"" game then this might not be what you're looking for, besides that, get it now!"
12250,It's as good a game as the second one and offers plenty of gameplay. I love my firefly.
12251,"In a nutshell, Borderlands is an FPS mixed with Diablo-esque ARPG elements of grinding and leveling. The visual style is cartoony, yet oddly compelling and four different characters as well as the randomized loot will keep the game somewhat fresh on subsequent playthroughs. The scenery is a bit dull, even though they try to freshen things up by the end at least a bit.

The plot of the game is, unfortunately, nearly non-existant. The few lightly fleshed out characters you meet won't actually have that many voiced lines and the actual ""bad guy"" of the game remains so wallflowery that I didn't even realise she existed until the very end. Oh, and the ending... well, less said, the better. To me it was, unfortunately, rage inducing. I would also like to point out that when I originally bought the non-steam version of the game, it didn't even have the courtesy to work on my computer until I downloaded a cracked .exe for it. Shame on the developers.

Still, if you're looking for a decent ARPG to sink a few hours into, Borderlands isn't such a bad choice to be honest. Although it's hard to get into the story or characters, you can at times get absorbed in the world and the non-stop silly yet gory action. At least it's something different in a sea of mediocre fantasy-themed hack-and-slashes."
12252,"And I was all like, ""Pew pew pew pew pew. 'Murica."""
12253,"the destroyer is a fucking pussy
took < 1 minute to kill"
12254,Crazy people. Crazy enviornment. Lots of guns. Kill stuff and win. Borderlands are on border of awesome.
12255,"Borderlands is a great game that is well optimised for pc, (except for dynamic shadows), and I prefer the 1st over the second because the first had a better enviornment and had much funnier humor. The second has better coop though, so it just depends on what you would rather have in your game experiance. I would recommend this game to people wanting a new fps game with rpg elements, (or if you're sick of call of duty)."
12256,"This game has absolutely no interest in distracting you from what it is with contrivances like plot or unexpected changes in the gameplay. At the start of the game, you run around a desert landscape, shooting beasties and bandits with an array of guns, and it's what you do at the end of the game, too. There's a brief moment in literally the last act where a plot appears and new enemies arrive, but it's over quickly. If what you want is run-and-gun gameplay, you'll be happy in the Borderlands."
12257,It is ok.
12258,wow such fun
12259,"I want to LOVE Borderlands. I played almost 25 hours of it.

Borderlands definitely fulfills my Diablo 2 needs of loot collecting. The main characters are incredibly interesting - both visually and and personality-wise - and the game has a LOT of customibility

But unlike Diablo 2 where there are segmented levels, Borderlands WANTS to be a open-world game. That's where it suffers. There's a lot of open space but not a lot to do. You'll find yourself traveling a lot without shooting. A LOT of traveling.The missions are fetch-quests and they can be better. And that is why I can't recommend it. When it drags... it drags! I can't subject myself to playing it a second time, knowing that I have to do all that traveling again.

The DLCs are much better developed than the main game though, and I'd recommend getting them. The Game of the Year version with the DLC I can  recommend. The vanilla Borderlands game itself - 
not so much."
12260,Awesome game... Graphics are a bit cartoony but the gameplay is awesome!!! Must get for everyone...
12261,Definitely had a lot of fun with this game!
12262,"It's a great game, recommendend it to friends and we loved it!"
12263,One of the greatest games to man kind. Seriously so much fun!!! Multiplayer and single player!!! Sent many hours enjoying such beauty.
12264,"BL1 is a FPS enjoyable, fun to play, into a wild world where one can do whatever wants; weapons work fast, vehicles are easily mouse controlled; all is fast and responsive; it has a sadist touch at places; at I had no technical problem installing and using at a PC with single-playing. For me the best is the replay value, since it keeps the interest even when you already know it, playing as another character type, or as multiplayer, up to more 3 players. Youtube videos support any doubt about game-play and are a warranty no one gets stuck in the story line or at hard places. Believe me you get the most by playing the game as single player, up to discovering The Vault. Not all objectives need to be made as soon they are listed, some are intended you to come back. Sure one can get a help going multiplayer at hard places - setting your host name as “help” - but all are possible without others help, if you dare. This game is very valuable in hours, it can endure for months, and still be fun.

I had difficulties setting the Internet play working due to the need for router port forwarding settings, who were solved within the last updates - so Gearbox says. Sound and micro control is not very flexible, but work. Steam support has all the answers, an advantage of this being a game with some years.

Another top value for me is the instant rewarding system, a novelty for me at the time: every thing one makes right or achieve counts, literally, I mean, the count is visible in a perfect playable way. This itself can be interesting as a kind of wild economic system. The leveling system, the better weapons access, are truly effective for player motivation. And the story, nevertheless fable, is good enough to keep going for more, until The Vault.

I found after replaying BL1 more than a dozen times there were still new ways to explore it, finding some map paths, mods and even some community made maps, around a project named Oasis. The first wave of Borderlands I players, more than 3 years ago, were enthusiastic up to that point, yes. Unfortunately game updates made the access to those maps complicated and even technically not recommended as it can trash your saved games or crash the game. I just can hope one day that will be taken care by Gearbox, as a reward .

One of my greatest surprises were the extend of the maps outside the playable area, I mean, all those landscape are actual ground a player can walk into knowing some secret paths shown at youtube videos. I would love a BL1 revisited version could just open those access, mainly at the best DLC ever made: The Secret Armory of General Knoxx (level 50 recommended) . That and some modifications would make it re-interesting.

I saw too many players losing the value of the game by going too early multiplayer, where too high players make all the work for them, or getting some cheated modifications. My advice is first go at The Vault, alone. Then you will have another opportunity to play. Mods are another way to keep the interest. An advice: keep some saves from the lower levels. And please, never spoil a new player game by helping too much. The Steam 4 GOTY editions pack is a very good gift for your FPS friends. Nevertheless, again, do it alone the first time, It is worthy, if you dare! :-)"
12265,"This game is quite fun. I love the art style. This game is best with friends; I don't think I could have played it alone. The story is not compelling enough to pay attention to, but the humor makes paying attention to random dialogue worth it."
12266,"This is the game that started it all. I love RPG Shooters, the chance to get some epic loot, and being able to play together with friends. The story and quests are entertaining as well and the art is very unique. With many different characters to choose from, this game has some serious replay value. One of my most favorite games aside from its sequel of course: Borderlands 2"
12267,The first truly great Co-Op focused FPS/ARPG out there.
12268,great game
12269,Great game! Lots of fun and very funny!!
12270,"I found Borderlands to be a very fun FPS, and I especially enjoyed the various RPG elements. I am a big fan of the leveling system, the skill trees, and the sheer variety of items and guns. The art style of the game is another huge plus, giving Borderlands a unique and distinctive feel. Combat itself works well, even if it gets a bit tedious and repetitive over time. In fact, I would say the overall ""grindy"" nature of the game was its biggest negative for me. I simply didn't sink the hours into this that I have into comparable games, and only ever bothered playing one of the characters through the story (the soldier). Still, Borderlands is fun, and well worth playing for fans of the genre."
12271,"This game is probably the most interesting RPG FPS ever to exist.  It is by far the most complicated leveling system i've ever seen, and later on this leveling system serves only to MURDER you if the monsters are higher level.  In any case, the game is great fun and very difficult.  I suggest if it goes on sale, to buy this great game."
12272,"Borderlands is now up there with the best games I've ever played. A perfect marriage of role playing and first person shooters, I've never played anything quite like it.  I put 100+ hours into this game, explored every nook and cranny, and completed everything and all the DLC 100%, every achievement. This game was incredible.  Pinpoint accuracy with the randomly generated weapons, a great storyline, missions that didn't bore you, and enemies that ranged from good to great.  There were even a couple of moments that made me laugh out loud.  If you own the game, play it if you haven't.  If you don't, it's time to buy it.  You can find a good deal where you can get the entire game and all it's DLC pretty cheap around the holidays.  As Scooter would say, ""Let's get you rollin!""  A++"
12273,Great game - beat it many times (Like Fallout)
12274,Fun ! Fast ! and enough content to keep yourself for a very very very long period occupied with this game!
12275,this game is horrible. the graphics look like a 2 yr old drew them.
12276,"The graphics are average, but the game is still fun. I would definitely recommend this game if purchased at a discount."
12277,Borderlands is an amazing game and is worth every cent. Endless hours of gameplay and coop with friends.
12278,"Even though it lives in nostalgic quality, i say this game aged like fine wine, and is always fun to go back to."
12279,"this game is fun you kill stuf with guns.


lots of guns

like frigin tons of guns

like gun gallore"
12280,"Love this game. The artwork and detail even though somewhat outdated still make this game worth playing, the run and gun style keeps me focused and even though it can be a but repetitive but hey just means i know what to do next."
12281,"Just Purely and Insanely Fun, Single Player is great fun But may Get Boring At times but it Helps entertain you On many levels while the Multiplayer addition to it was just outstandingly AMAZING!! Loved how the more players there are, the more tougher the enemy is, the better the reward is and you can do missions and etc with friends :D It is a MUST GET!"
12282,this is one my favorite games
12283,GET IT!
12284,Brilliant game
12285,gearbox can't do anything right.
12286,Fun Totally different game to play and Funny I enjoy it!
12287,Also a great buy.
12288,"The original Borderlands was big and ambitions FPS, giving players a Diablo-ish loot system with ""billions"" of guns (composed of parts under the hood), loosely RPG-ish mission system, vehicles, AND 4-player co-op that scales difficulty and rewards to the number of players. The inventory system isn't perfect, the NPCs are essentially static billboards, the story falls flat, and some regions and enemies are more fun than others. But overall it's a good-looking game full of challege, humor, wacky characters, a ridiculous number of guns, and many, many hours of entertainment. The bang for the buck is incredible. Don't forget the Secret Armory of General Knoxx DLC, which increases the level cap and adds some great new missions. The other DLC is probably skippable."
12289,"Absolutely excellent. The game's feel and style is great. The gore is fantastic, when you can blow someone's head clean off with a critical hit, and then proceed to blast off his arms and legs while he falls to the ground. The story was good too. However, I feel like they could have amped up the difficulty a bit. The game get's a bit easy even in playthrough 2 if you have some decent gear.

The DLC was the best part in my opinion. Especially General Knoxx's Armory, and Claptrap Interplanetary Robot Assassin.

Another thing to note is: Play this game before you buy the second one, or else you will be lost on most of the flashbacks and storyline. And you'll get to see how much Gearbox fucked up the gore and the action of the Borderlands series itself."
12290,"Borderlands is a case study in how to take core gameplay that's actually pretty good and still churn out a game so terrible that it's literally headache-inducing. A first-person shooter with Diablo style loot is a recipe for fun, although Gearbox didn't come up with the idea first. And it's on this level that Borderlands actually partially delivers, because it's a solid FPS with a ton of loot that should satisfy fans of dungeon crawlers and shooters alike. Unfortunately, everything else about this game is dull, repetitive, and annoying. The camera jerks up and down like Michael J. Fox when walking or running, placing a hamper on the action that takes some getting used to. Borderlands provides no variety in scenery, either. Every dungeon and overworld is just some vast, bland, lifeless desert thing, and what little life exists in the game is either trying to kill you or spouting off stupid humor. This is to say nothing of the game's ludicrous claim that it has thousands of guns when it actually has about five guns with varying stats. As much as I dislike Borderlands, I will say that I don't know of anything else that's quite like it, which is a shame. A competent developer with a little more creativity could have done wonders with the idea."
12291,One of the best games I've ever Played.
12292,"The king of FPS games for me. 
The story isn't so interesting, and the end of the base game is disappointing, but the mechanics...
Those weapons, bosses and other enemies, car races, special abilities etc make this game unforgottable for me.
I spent almost 80 hour with the single player mode and I enjoyed every minute of it. I didn't try co-op, but that's not my style. 
I can recommend it for every hardcore FPS fans.
"
12293,Hours of great co-op fun!!
12294,:)
12295,Amazing game. Anyone who has played BL2 and not this one should definitely play this. The DLC is fantastic and it also explains the story of BL2 better than they try to in the second one. 9/10 would play again.
12296,loved it at the start got bored in the end but totaly worth you'r money!
12297,"a very good game for 4 people ! 
graphics solid 6 but you get used to it!
funfactor 10
jokes 9

solo: it is well done
multiplayer : very funny in a group ^^"
12298,"Honestly... one of my favorite games ever. I've played this game on and off for about 8 years and I just keep going back to play it. It's one of those games you never get over. Very fun game to play with a group of friends (up to 4 players total). The DLC content is definitely worth it. The story isn't the best in the world, but the underlying humor while playing through makes up for it. Definitely a recommended game, especially if you have a group of friends to play it with."
12299,Wander around a giant dump looking for naughty magazines... and the pages are all sticky... this is so gross
12300,"I love this game. So much fun and so addictive they should put a warning label on it. And you'll want to play all or nearly all the characters, just because there're all that much fun to play. (The only character I don't like playing is the Sniper one. I play all the others (A LOT)  though.) Buy this... and watch all your free time go down the drain, as this will suck away all and repalce it with it's funness. And yes, that is a word, because I say so. Hehe."
12301,May definitely be addidicting.
12302,"Decent game to play alone, but much more memorable and entertaining with friends. The debut to one of my favorite game series. Not much of a story, but great gameplay."
12303,"This good team work game :)
"
12304,Fab
12305,9/10 ~its ok
12306,"A very good game, good combination of FPS and RPG genres where you can upgrade your guns and armour and fight against levelled mobsters. Has only a little story attached to give the gamer some motivation to progress.."
12307,Great game especially if you want fun for 1-4 players.. 9.5/10 for me!
12308,"It's a great game, it really is. It has a few cons against it, but with Co-Op it is really fun.
Singleplayer is also great, and pro tip, The Hellfire is the most overpowered weapon in the entire game. THat and a SMG mod ammo regenerator is equal to the kind of Borderlands."
12309,"Borderlands is such a crazy RPG game. It seems so many different things can happen in this game. From different enemies fighting each other to the hilarious dialouge you can hear, Borderlands is full of comedy, adventure, danger and more! The guns are some of my favorites of most games due to the fact you can find weapons that will set people on fire, melt them with acid, electricute them, and more. The vehicles are fun to use, as you can splatter most anything in your path with ease, as well as run over high level creatrues you couldn't normally kill and still get a ton of experience points for it. The characters are unforgettable, as most of them are quite funny, or otherwise have funny things said about them. The exploration is great, with many different places to go, and different stuff to see. There are tons of quests in the game to keep you busy once you've beaten it, or even when you haven't beaten it. Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good RPG game."
12310,"I got this game on a free to play weekend I decided to purchase it afterward. Trust me, the 7 bucks was well worht it. Not only is this game addicting but the different classes and DLC give the game a ton of replay value. I have just recently started on my second playthrough. One of my few complaints though is that enemies can feel somewhat cheap at times. For some of the later missions you might find youself doing a bit of grinding to raise your level since the difficulty of the mission depends on what level you are currently at. I would recommend this to anyone who likes RPGs and open world FPS games"
12311,I bloody LOVE this game!!!
12312,"Great game. This goes for all of the Borderlands titles I've played (1, 2 and TPS)"
12313,Abram
12314,"It's a role-playing shooter. Original, visually attractive and funny, but if you're going to play this on your own you get bored after a couple of hours. But if you're with some friends and you want to shoot some stuff, grind and loot more badass guns, that's the right game. Well it's perfect if you are looking for a LAN-game!"
12315,GG fun and ejoyabe
12316,Great Game :D
12317,"Very fun with friends, not the biggest fan of Gearbox but this is their gem.

The randomized guns and the pure amount of things to do with friends while leveling up and killing everything in sight is really great.

The story isn't anything amazing, and the ending can almost ruin the whole adventure for you...but you don't play randomized lootfest games for the story, right?....right?

The DLC's are equally as fun, some of them get VERY difficult. I highly reccommend trying this game out, as long as you have 2 or 3 friends to play with."
12318,"Fun shooter, quite difficult in some places. You really need to manage your weapons effectively. Shotting enemies in different areas offers a critical hit rate. This is the same on every 'species' of enemies. Bleh."
12319,One of the best ever.
12320,its the tits
12321,Is a epic game
12322,"GOTY is the best all the add ons, never missed a single boss"
12323,"I loved this game, the mix with FPS and RPG is just fantastic, and the fact that you can level your character and spend points in your talents tree is awesome! The art is great as well, and there are lots and lots of different weapons that you can try, until you find one that you really like! Playing by yourself is great, but it's a lot more fun when you play it with friends, the enemies get tougher and the loot gets better. 100% recommended!"
12324,"This game is SO much fun! Its WAY better in Co-Op. Me and my friend played this for hours straight and got a huge kick out of it. You should DEF get this game, even more so if you have a friend to play it with. I TOTALLY recommend this game. Get it and  have hours of fun! :D"
12325,its fun
12326,In will blow yo head ! Insane game ! Must buy
12327,"A Really action pack game. Full of fun.
"
12328,"i first bought borderlands 2 and enjoyed myself, then just recently bought borderlands 1, and although while i think these games were overhyped and overpraised i do have fun playing them, but like borderlands 2 i have one simple issue-that being, the LACK of difficulty. its easy to fix if you mess around with the config files and play singleplayer (or was it lan?) but i dont think i should have to risk fucking up my game files just to get a challenge. other than that i cant complain for getting bl/goty for 5$."
12329,"GUN PORN!!! So many Nerf like guns. Story is meh.. but the RPG elements are solid. The gunplay is just perfect. I love Cell-shaded graphics, it adds to the charm this game has. I found myself repeating Critical BITCH! all day.. I've heard so much good about this game before I bought and I hear the 2nd is better.. GearBox you have my respect"
12330,"To be honest, I have no idea how I could play this game for over 100 hours.
I'm not a fan of post-apocolyptic scenarios and no big fan of shooters either. Still, I decided to give it a try when the Game of the Year edition was on offer. Surely I must have enjoyed it in several aspects, or I couldn't have reached my playtime of 100h with just one playthrough of the main game and the DLCs except for Moxxi's Underdome, because this one takes forever.

So what I'm actually saying is this:
The game has something really addictive and might be fun even if you're not a big fan of this genre. However, since there is already Borderlands 2, which I haven't played yet, but seems to mainly improve the gameplay of it's predecessor without taking steps backwards I would say that it might be the better choice. Especially since the story isn't really the most important part of this game."
12331,"Wicked game. im more of a Rpg kinda a girl, so it took me a bit to figure out the controls but well worth the time and effort. its a really well thought out game with so much creativity behind it. im not too far in so we'll see what the next bunch of lvls brings!"
12332,this is a well crafted game i would buy this three time over if i could just play it again for the first time
12333,This gaem is da bestest gaem in da wurld. wurf
12334,"Borderlands is simply one of the best games ever made.  They blended RPG and FPS elements and the result is wonderful.  Coupled with a great underlying game engine and terrific storyline/atmosphere, this game shines amongst the game choices out today.  Throughout the game, you're consitently challenged without the RPG elements becoming too repetitious.  Overall, Borderlands is a wonderful game that will have you coming back to it over and over again."
12335,"I am a late comer into this game.. I am amazed on how challenging it is and the RPG elements really makse this game awesome.
I can not wait to start playing the second one."
12336,Huge and massively immersive world. Cell shaded and beautiful with more Easter eggs and cultural references than you thought could fit in a game. It's an amazing gameworld that will draw you in.
12337,"Open World+RPG+FPS Shooting game
at first time I played as hunter, it's very difficult. 
So, I try to played as soldier, It's quite easy.
I think it will be the great game if u play multiplayer but it's vey lag(maybe only me)
If u wanna waste ur time, I recommend the game.

Score : 7.5/10"
12338,"Borderlands is set on the distant planet of Pandora - a Mad-Maxian desert like planet riddled with gang wars and strange alien beasts. 

It's been some time since I've played Borderlands so my memory of this game might be lacking in some areas. To start this off, I'm going to say that I'm actually recommending against Borderlands. While this game does have good reviews there are a lot of problems with this game that keep me from personally recommending it. 

Borderlands is what I'd describe as proverbial empty calories of gaming. Borderlands will keep you playing and you won't think that while playing a game that it's bad. This game is shamefully easy but rewards the player copiously with loot drops that keep the player interested. There's so much loot that even a packrat completionist gamer like myself was forced to ignore much of it. 

After completing Borderland and experiencing its incredibly unsatisfying ending I felt it was a gross misuse of my time that ultimately left me unsatisfied as a gamer. Like a pint of Ben and Jerry's, Borderlands will keep you playing until the end but ultimately leave you with a feeling of shame.

There is some DLC for it that I probably purchased at some ridiculous steam sale price but I've yet to even play it. A tell-tale sign that this game is just too medicore to recommend.

Save your time and money and stay away from ""Bored""erlands. 

Score:
6/10"
12339,"It's kind of heard to recommend Borderlands. The humor isn't there, the gameplay is boring and repetitive, and even playing with friends isn't that great. I once almost fell asleep whilst playing the game with a friend and he actually stopped playing because the game made him want to go to sleep. It's all rather grindy and unexciting. With that being said, I will actually recommend it because of the fact that it is grindy and unexciting. Because it has forgettable music, a forgettable cast of characters, a forgettable storyline, and dull dialog, I can easily mute most of that and play some music. I went through several new albums whilst playing this game. If I had never played Borderlands, I would have never known that Alt-J sucks so very much, I mean, the hell is their appeal? They're terrible. So if you've got a bunch of albums available to you that you want to listen to but you also want to do something at the same time that won't entirely take up your focus, pop on those albums and play some Borderlands. So long as you stay awake, it should be quite comforting."
12340,"A nice little sleeper-hit from 2009, Borderlands showed modern first-person shooters how it's really done by combining an open-world sandbox game with the old-school FPS combat of the mid-to-late 1990s, creating an immensely satisfying and cathartic experience that you just don't see from many shooters today. Its perfectly dank and dirty setting filled with a collection of good, evil and funny characters, some of whom are all three, makes it a must-play."
12341,"Really enjoyable game to play coop with friends. Tons of loot, with a not too bad system to easily compare it all. Comic-book type graphics, if you're into that sort of thing."
12342,"This game have everything: exciting action, great story, memorable characters, fun levelling/looting, amazing villains... One of the best games of the 21st century!"
12343,"A near infinite range of weapons and items, and fun shooter gameplay. Excellent four-player co-op mode. Distinctive visuals and genuinely funny script. Easily worth the money. However, the single-player experience is improved but it’s still far less interesting than co-op. Game world still feels unconnected and occasionally sterile. Very little visual customisation."
12344,borderladsis a game were your looking for the amazing vault but you face lots of trouble to obtain the vault
12345,Crazy storyline. Loveable characters. Epic amounts of weapons and loot. Fun to play with friends.
12346,"Very impressive game. Borderlands combines two unrelated genres (FPS and RPG) for an amazing outcome. The driving force to this game is balanced between looting/shooting. Character skill trees are original and interesting. Borderlands also chose to be a cell shaded game, but dont worry, its very gruesome with alot of comedic acting."
12347,"A Masterpeice of the RPG Genre. Imagine, not just doing quests, but being able to do whatever you please, kill enemies, sure, drive around, again, why not? but how about fighting your friends, playing grenade tag, having races, role playing, trading guns, grinding, leveling, with endless replayability thanks to a new game + type thing. if you have the second one, this one is a must have. New to the franchise in General? considering buying the second but not this? Get this one, unlike the second, it provides plenty more of open world places, and a much more Wastelandish experiance. Get this game, and make sure to tell you friends, and if you think beating every  quest and maxing your level is it? Well as the intro says: There aint no rest for the wicked"
12348,"An epic game if you like big explosion, nasty language/attitude, chicks made cartoony, all around a good game with twists and turns."
12349,buybuybuy
12350,Absolutely a Masterpiece for the combination of RPG and FPS.
12351,"Borderlands is a very unique and awesome game, while it is not for everyone, it is for the most people a great game."
12352,"This is like Diablo but in first person.  You go around killing things, collect a bunch of junk you aren't going to use, sell it for a bunch of money you aren't going to spend, in order to maybe buy some things you haven't been able to find, just to kill more things, repeating the cycle ad nauseum.
The player and enemies have a frustratingly large amount of HP, a seemingly unavoidable trope in all videogames which leads you to shooting someone over and over again without regard to things like stopping power, or the fact that a bullet to the heart would likely kill you instantly.
The graphics are interesting (not original, but then again what is?), but are wasted on deserts and- wait for it- wastelands.  If this game took place on a jungle planet then we could really appreciate the art.  As it is the terrain is fairly boring."
12353,Great game with dark humour...love the south west feel to it and the various lanscapes. Picking off dudes amongst the trash piles is a blast.
12354,Catch a ride on this amazing FPRPG. More guns than you can shake a stick at and even more enemies just dying to cut off your head for your loot. Did I mention loot? Loot loot loot until you need some healz then loot some more. Race around the land of borders in a sick dune buggy while squashing open-face armadillo dogs. Laugh at that funny little robot who has more use than he gives himself credit. Boomheadshot across the desert until you can call yourself a true and victorious Vault hunter. BIG BOSSES.
12355,"While this version of the game is nothing but a shoddy console port gimpled with the obsolete service that is Gamespy, this game still has its merits as a dignified multiplayer co-op experience.  Good for multiple playthroughs, enriched with rather-decent DLC, this game may disapoint PC users for its lack of an FOV slider and it's non-mouse friendly User Interface, but it can still please anyone."
12356,This game = Super kewl
12357,it is good
12358,"I ain’t gonna bite, pro’ly

I was concerned that I might not like BORDERLANDS, as I’ve played games with stylised graphics before and have found this type of design can reduce the immersive qualities that I love about gaming. I need not have worried. Borderlands is one of the best games I’ve played. The visuals are very impressive and suck you right in. This is open-world gaming at it’s best, with many large maps to explore as you complete the numerous missions. There are hundreds of weapons to collect and use, or sell along the way (gathering loot quickly becomes addictive). A wide variety of enemies will take you on as you progress up the levels. The combat is varied and the AI is good if not exceptional. Although there’s little story to speak of there’s enough humour to just about make up for this. It’s possible that some might find the missions a tad repetitive but I was so engrossed in the game that I didn’t tire of them and completed every one, including the 3 DLCs available. As for multi-player, well co-op is great fun but best played with people who you can rely on to share the loot.

4/5"
12359,"Good game, like this fps shooter very much, and I give one advice, select siren, She have a good ass:)"
12360,"It's an FPS. It's an RPG. It's an adventure like no other!! Robots, mutants, psychopaths, monsters, enemies, allies, this game has EVERYTHING and MORE.  Huge, beautiful, open landscapes create an expansive environment that will take time to traverse, but there are so many missions, monsters, and treasures to be found that you won't care even if you're wandering around lost.

This game sets the standard for the FPS/RPG genre and you must play it.  It's more than worth the cost and you'll enjoy every minute of every hour you spend hunting and looting and levelling and customizing and laughing and crying and JUST PLAY IT ALREADY!!

Отличная смесь RPG+FPS диаблоподобная мочилово, весёленькое, с хорошим годным стилем и музыкальным сопровождением, немного хуесосные ДЛЦшки не портят особо отношение, игра отличная. Вот только самому в неё не стоит играть - уныло.

Графика с применением Cell-Shading мне очень зашла, не комиксодрочер, просто приятная. Играть очень весело в компании с друзьями и интересно. ПВП очень посредственное, играя за сирену спокойно мог убить всех остальных соло без проблем на любом этапе игры.

У игры отличный юмор, хоть и сюжет тут для галочки, но блядь, играть в неё ахуенно.

12390,"When the FPS market was filled with dirt-colored instakill milsperg games, Gearbox came out with a hybrid FPS-RPG shooter that featured a silly (but well-written) plot, over the top characters, ridiculous abilities, and rainbow colored weapons.  All in a cell-shaded cartoon style.

And it was a smashing success.

Now Borderlands didn't do everything perfectly.  Gunplay was rather cartoony (the best in my opinion was in the STALKER series).  Vehicles handled rather awkwardly.  And certain missions were little more than glorified fetch quests, which seemed to exist more to pad the length of the game.

On the other hand though the original Borderlands did some things right.  Classes were well thought out, with enough abilities and variations that it was actually difficult to choose which perk to pick.  Enemies were varied enough to create more strategy than ""shoot everything in the face"".

But the two best aspects of Borderlands were the setting and the guns.  Oh the guns.

Between the colorful landscapes and the more colorful characters, Borderlands was very easy on the eyes.  And while neither the characters or plot were particularly deep, complicated, or thought provoking, they had enough of a contrast to keep things interesting (unlike say the BL2 Tiny Tina DLC which is both zany and rather thoughtful).

And the guns... which do so many amazing things in so many amazing ways that it puts my previous favorite (the ""amazing"" AN-94) to shame.  You will pretty much keep playing because the next gun might be a tad bit more shiny or shooty than the one you currently hold.  It's an addiction.

In the year 2013 it's hard to recommend Borderlands only because Borderlands 2 is out.  But for the right price (I'd value the complete game plus DLCs at $15-$20) it's worth picking up."
12391,"★★☆☆☆ Okay!

[h1]Action[/h1]

Borderland is not as ground-breaking as many people claim it to be. It's a combination of RPG and old fashion first person shooter.

This game wasn't originally made for the PC-market, but it was ported. However it's a fairly decent port, some of the controls are objectionable, there are a couple of instances where you have to use your arrow keys to navigate through menus, something PC-gamers aren't very fond off. The biggest problem with the fact that the game is ported, have to do with the game's difficulty. A direct effect of putting a console FPS game on a PC is that the game becomes ridiculously easy.

The fact that the AI is incredibly dumb isn't making this less of a problem. The bots will continuously try to shoot you through objects, such as houses and metal walls. Some bosses I was able to take down by simply standing still, the final boss for instance.

The class system is not very unique, not new in any way, shape or form. It saddens me that such potential got lost here. It doesn't really feel as if the classes make any particular difference whatsoever. The classes is just a mare smoke and mirrors, there's nothing really special about the classes, maybe except for the soldier.

The creeps look virtually identical throughout the entire game. You never get to see anything new. The same goes for weapons, there are pretty much 7 different kinds of weapons to chose from in the entirety of the game. The only thing being different is the stats, and sometimes the scope. That is artificial diversity as far as I'm concerned.

The missions are also very similar, there are a few kinds of mission types (kill X of Y, collect X many Y etc.), but nothing above that. This makes for an extremely repetitive and boring game, with almost no replayability.

My conclusion is that this game is worthwhile playing if you got 2-3 friends to play with and if you like repetitive games, with virtually no story attached to it."
12392,"Absolute mayhem, with the occasional ""fetch"" quest or monster-slaying side job for some quick rewards.  If you like shooting electrocution bullets that make bandits' heads explode, or flame-throwing shotguns, or acid-spewing rocket launchers for face-melting fun, then you'll love this game.  You get to choose a character class, each with a unique set of skills but the ability to use the same guns (to different levels of effectiveness depending which skills you enable) and then you get to explore a barely-colonized alien planet.  You'll fight your way through small armies of mostly-human bandits and corporate soldiers as well as hordes of alien insects and rodents, all working towards opening ""The Vault"" which is a mythical treasure trove that most of the locals don't even believe exists.  You'll find plenty of weapons as you go to experiment with, so see how many different ways you can make your enemies scream.  Some of them will thank you for it.  This game is fun with a single-player campaign.  It's also fun (and a lot easier) when you play with a friend.  If you get this game, you should also consider the DLC mission packs to expand the campaign beyond the main game, add some new side-jobs, and put some new enemies (i.e. zombies) and weapons into play."
12393,"Borderlands - an interesting game that combines FPS and RPG. 
One of the most fun games out there, definitely worth picking up :)"
12394,Borderlands and Borderlands 2 are amazing games with a lot of work put into them by the developers.  Hilarious entertainment mixed with a solid shooter that is customized to your style of gameplay based on the character you choose.
12395,"Pros:
+Procedurally generated loot is neat
+Excellent use of a cel-shaded graphics

Cons:
-Monsters have vaginas on their faces
-All of the missions are basically the same
-Each area looks copy and pasted
-Terrible story, especially the ending"
12396,"The core game is OK at best. Environments are somewhat drab though, constant brown barren expanses. There is a low variety in enemies. Most of the time you'll be shooting about four different types of enemies. The DLCs throw so much tripe at you though. The first one has very uninspiring zombies who are next to no threat, the second is a dull and repetative arena mode (but has an essential bank) the third gives several large areas, but for some reason there's no fast travel system like there is in the base game. The other DLCs are lacking it, but the third really suffers from it. It also has an issue where most of the enemies drop temporary power ups, but they only drop them whilst one quest is active. No real complaints about the last DLC, except the final boss of it is far harder than the rest of the content."
12397,Very cool game but after few hours its a little borring. borderlands 2 its way better than 1..
12398,"it has guns and guns and guns and guns and midgets, 10/10 game"
12399,Love it
12400,This game with all the DLCs is great fun ins single or multiplayer mode. There are many areas and tasks to do and many challenges.  I personally do not like Moxx's Thunderdome these fights can be very intense if you are in single player mode.
12401,tis borderlands!  I'd almost say this was better than the second one!
12402,"Guns, more guns, and yet more guns... Game for boys!"
12403,"Borderlands was a new project by Gearbox Software back in 2009. An excellent FPS is more like sci-fi FPS, that occur on world called - Pandora - and counts with a few RPG elements, since loot, to level up system. Is great! 

Graphically speaking could be a bit weired for some of you, i still remember the first time i saw a trailer and i was meh.. but i started liking the details, textures. Thanks to the cell shading, the game could hide behind pretty simple textures without appearing low-res, as the game does not have to look realistic.

Before we enter Pandora we have 4 characters to choose - The Hunter, Soldier, Siren e Berserker - that are all great and in case you play COOP, is better each of you use a different class. then you have the lvl up system, you will gain XP when you the main, secondary quest, also doing the challenges the game offer is great way to rank up.  

After you get your character, you are now good to enter in Pandora, and i must say is not a pretty place to be - laughs - lot of bad guys to kill and some weird dudes too. about the game difficulty, well is not too hard perhaps if you play solo some parts could be a little tricky but you will do it for sure. 

After beating the main boss you can do a new playthrough, there enemies/boss will be a bit tough, is like doing transition from normal to hard. 

If you are someone like me, who love loot you will love this game, loot everywhere. There are a lot of ways to get the better loot, farming boss, chase the safe etc.. Like in normal games loot has many categories - green, blue, purple, orange e pearlescent - and of course everyone wants that orange one! 

Also Borderlands has a huge variety of guns to choose, so you won't get bored of it. 

That's it, i totally recommend you play this game, solo or in COOP and enjoy your journey in Pandora. 

~ 8,5/10"
12404,"Shit game, enemies are to bullet sponge, story is boring, multiplayer is lacking the key element ""fun"". Would not buy whish I could sell it back. My score is -123/12"
12405,Dem Lootz
12406,"Much guns, such fight, wow"
12407,"Without a doubt, one of the best ""Shopping Simulator"" games ever made. 

   Do you enjoy killing a bunch of things, picking up lots of ""loot"", then going to a shop to sell and buy approximately 4,678 times in the course of a 50+ hour gaming experience? Then this is the game for you. 

   If, like myself, you would prefer to only kill one type of enemy about, oh, 800 times over, rather than 8,000 times over, the preposterously lengthy and repetitive gameplay might wear a little thin after a while. Personally, I enjoyed about the first 30 hours, and only kept going all the way to the end out of principle (having reached the point of no return). 

   And the best part of all? If killing the final boss isn't enough for you, the designers have kindly offered the opportunity for you to KEEP PLAYING, even though the plot is finished and the credits have rolled. But hey, you still have MILLIONS more enemies to kill and BILLIONS more things to pick up and sell. So why stop. EVER..?

Think I'll give myself a slight rest before Borderlands 2. Don't get me wrong...this game has tonnes of personality, fantastic graphics, a great world, amusing characters, and enough good ideas for a good many games. But you really, really, REALLY can have too much of a good thing. And whatever you do, don't even HUMOUR the notion of tackling it single player. If ever a game needed friends with headsets, this'd be it. WAY too much brainless ""fun"" for one person to endure alone.

Verdict: 7.5/10."
12408,"Growing up on games like Quake and Diablo really helped me to appreciate the greatness of Borderlands. There’s been a lot of games that have tried to pull off genre hybrids, but they either fail to deliver or just fail to program a game correctly. Borderlands is one of the few games that manages to feel like an RPG and a FPS at the same time.

Coming from a shooter side, the game is a very fun classic style shooter, meaning that the realism has been replaced with you getting to unload a clip into someone before dropping them. Sniper head-shots can generally take a foe down with one shot, but most all other guns are going to require you to get dirty. It feels an awful lot like a classic Quake shooter too. It’s just action based. Your ‘cover’ system is generally using you strafe and jump at the right time. By all means, this a welcome to some older gamers since most of today’s games are just striving to hit a certain realistic feel.

From an RPG point, the game does take a few tumbling points in certain areas. The biggest problem is the skill tree. It’s pretty bare and some of the skills just feel useless. There’s also not enough skills to pin you into one type of character. Are you a Hunter looking to just be the stay-back sniper? Well, you can max those skills out but you can’t invest only points into one branch. It would have been nice to borrow a few more of the Diablo elements, allowing you to create an amazingly unique character from branches. Instead, you’re left feeling a bit underwhelmed by the skills. The only other problem with the RPG element is the characters all feel about the same. My Hunter manages to be a jack-of-all-trades character instead of just a hunter. While I might technically do more damage with a sniper rifle, my dark-orange rare machine gun that does 4x fire damage is going to take down the enemies faster. While these two things are a bit critical, the rest of the action role-playing feels genuine. Looting is fun; leveling up is fun; and having a huge inventory is very nice.

From a graphic standpoint, this might not be a masterpiece, and some may feel a little turned off by the cartoony look, but by all means, you can at least distinguish this title from the other 90% of shooters that look like Modern Warfare clones. The one problem with the game’s graphics is some unstable frame rates, mainly when there’s a lot of blood on screen, a lot of elemental damage, or just towards the end of the game. It’s not unplayable, but the slowdowns shouldn’t be happening at all. Aside from that, it’s a nice refreshing look and feels more like a video game than a simulator.

There’s a story to the game, but even after playing through the game two times, I don’t think I could tell you what it’s about other than treasure hunting. Personally, I think the lack of story kept me more interested. I wasn’t worried about progressing to the end as much as I was trying to kill as many things as I could to find the next best weapon. While the story lacks in a big way, it would be nice to have a bit more of it in the next title release.

Where most people are probably going to go wrong with this title is trying to play this game as a single player game. Don’t bother. This was meant to be a co-op game. It’s like playing Left 4 Dead alone. It’s possible, but you’re going to actually enjoy playing the game when you have friends around. A benefit of having more friends play with you is that the game rewards you with more rare items. Plus, if you want to break away from the typical gameplay, they’ve installed arenas around the area to help you test out your gear against other foes, or to just play a little smack down with a friend.

And for you achievement/trophy treasure finders out there, this title is pretty easy to get 100% in. What’s more interesting is the Medals (or challenges) you can try for with each character. Trying to get 2,000 head-shots or get the max number of cash in the game is wildly fun. It actually feels more like an extra quest in the game, since each challenge gives you a nice pot of experience points.

My final thoughts on the game: it’s a fantastic game, and for a new IP, it’s refreshing to see that there’s companies that still want to bring new or greatly tweaked genres to the table. While there’s some work to be done in some areas, the game had me fork over $60 and supplied me with $100 worth of entertainment."
12409,first of its kind best of its kind
12410,Get it.
12411,"Not so fun man, not so fun."
12412,"This game is the FPS that Diablo wanted to be.  Seriously, if you love the FPS but wanted a bit more world to have to crawl + missions to complete, here you go!

While I haven't played Borderlands 2 yet I hear that it is like the first but without some of the issues."
12413,"Good humour and doesn't take itself too seriously which is part of its charm. The art is a little bland and there's not much endgame but it's addictive and a great multiplayer blast that doesn't suffer from the bloody stupid difficulty setting problem of the sequel.

It's a loot based game where you are a vault hunter who is looking for said vault. Legend has it that it's filled with loot. There are four classes to choose from that feel distinctly different. As you level up you choose (mostly passive) new skills. Each class has a unique skill they can activate that really helps them out of a tight spot. For example Brick (the tank class) goes berserk and gains super powerful punches, health regen and damage resistance.

The weapons are wacky and nonsensical but loads and loads of fun. Rocket launchers that fire five rockets at once, shotguns that fire pellets in a wave formation, corrosive assault rifles, rocket firing shotguns. So many different guns its just silly, a good silly.

Sadly there is an ugly side to the weapons. Modded weapons are rife in Borderlands, either with sensible stats or those that are just over the top (capable of one-shotting Crawmerax). If you hate modded weapons in your game being polite and asking for them not to be used is usually met with rudeness or plain defiance. Also be aware of the idiots that don't get you might be new to the game and don't realize that you are unaware that the gun you have is modded (modders like to hand them out). You try and explain you didn't realize and their tiny little minds still go into rage overdrive, unable to process that little bit of information. I'm sorry internet tough guy!

Anyway aside from the human race occasionally buggering things up (again) you can also join plenty of random games without that nonsense."
12414,"Although the game is charming and has a brilliant storyline with intresing gameplay, it is obviously a console port. The controls are clunky (even with a gamepad) the FOV tends to cause sickness after prolonged play, and the graphics are obviously not optimised for PC. I would consider buying it on a console or buying the much more PC-friendly second installment."
12415,not bad
12416,"It is fun...until it gets way too repetative.  You kill the same people, they say the same things, it is a little boring by the time you play 6-8 hours of the game.  The new one does a little better but you can get a better game for the same price."
12417,"Interesting setting, but the story is boring and non-immersive. You're FAR better off just skipping this and playing Borderlands 2."
12418,"Borderlands is an example of a very good blend of FPS & RPG & Dungeon Crawler.  Overall the graphics are great, the artwork on gun and enemies is great, and the combat flows well.  Due to the game's genre, the gameplay hours naturally will be high for a FPS, which is nice.  So here are my negatives, (take note that Borderlands is one of my favorite games in the past couple of years).
The Skill trees are awful.
The Weapons each character specializes in are not balanced(i.e. one character specializes in the two strongest weapons)
The game offers 4 elements that can be infused to weapons, I found one element worth using.
The game offers 4 DLC maps/quests.  One is very good (zombie), one is average(Knoxx), and the other 2 are awful; what i found from the DLC, is each one offered small additions to the whole game that were needed in the first place, example the Underdome DLC added a Stash, which was not part of the original game."
12419,"omg, such game. very fun. very gun. very explosions, very wow."
12420,"I remember reading about Borderlands. It sounded cool. Procedurally generated guns? A neat-looking world? Awesome. Then they made it cell-shaded, which was... well, weird, but fun. The resulting game? Pretty fun too. It's seared into my memory as nothing less than pleasant awesomeness. I can't even begin to tell you how much fun I had pretending to be someone's hat by riding around on top of their car in my own.

I was the best hat.

Finding a loot chest felt good. Spending time jumping around the maps felt right. The enemies were neat, the guns inventive, the bosses kinda fun. It took me a long while to kill the final boss--where a friend killed it in less than half a second. Okay, so I didn't get the best loot on the planet, but I still had a blast. The game was funny, too. While the actual plot could have been better, the story told in logs and lore was amusing, and the character barks were great.

Where Borderlands really excelled, however, was the DLC. Doctor Zed was a minor disappointment, not because it wasn't funny (it was hilarious), and not because it didn't have a lot of content (it had a lot of content), but because some of the content was an awful lot of ""hey, go there, kill a thousand of that, bring me back some brains."" This got a bit old after a while. Moxxi's arena DLC was, well, an arena DLC. Not all that fun. But then, like a spark of inspiration from the gods, we got The Secret Army of General Knoxx, which had like twelve to fifteen hours of content, cost $10, was fun, well-written, smart, and excellent. It is still the gold standard for DLC. After that we got Claptrap's Robot Revolution, which was not quite as excellent, but we're talking Jaws to Jurassic Park here--still greats, regardless of which one you value more.

Borderlands is still, years after its release, a game worth playing. I still know most of the maps by heart, still have memories of some of my finest battles ingrained in my mind. Still feel a bit odd when playing the sequel and not having Bloodwing by my side. You definitely don't want to just skip it and head straight for Borderlands 2.

Only complaints? It wasn't a great PC port, so it had no FOV slider and used Gamespy for its online multiplayer component, meaning it was really hard to play with certain people."
12421,"It combines FPS and RPG, making it a very unique game. It also has a rather unique graphic style. Humor isn't missing either in this game. Story? Got it.
Overall it's a very fun experience with good enough replayability (4 different characters, a lot of sidemissions) and in case you're thinking of getting Borderlands 2, IMO, you should also get this. It's not necessary as you'll be able enough to follow the story without having played this first, but it definitely makes 2 even more enjoyable and you'll notice little things you wouldn't elseway, etc."
12422,"One of my all time favourite RPGs. Meant to be played with friends and if you can co-op a whole game with a close buddy you'll have a huge blast. Tons of guns, varied enemies and a bunch of classes to pick. 
The atmosphere in BL1 is superb and I prefer it much more to BL2, all of the DLC is fun as hell and is quite long and have a lot to offer and explore (except Moxxi's but hey ho it's just fun wave survival).
The ending isn't that brilliant but the DLC fills right in for it and gives you a lot more bang for your buck, the game boasts a nice cartoonish style with some cheesy and funny moments in between."
12423,I really enjoy this game it has great gameplay it's funny at times and it is a must have!
12424,"Diablo for the FPS crowd. An MMO for the solo or small group co-op crowd. An action game for the RPG crowd. It's the cross-genre, loot farming, head shotting, skill tree choosing, coop game for anyone who wants to shoot stuff for a while and feel like they hit a piñata as guns and upgrades fall out. Absolutely worth it when you can grab the GOTY on sale."
12425,"good if you're into open world fps grinding to level up weapons and skills. gets very repetitive quickly though. and the main storyline just ends ..

still, i found myself able to sink 80 hours into this in multi and single player quite happily :)"
12426,Run to this place. Shoot these bad guys. Run back. Repeat ad infinitum. No thanks.
12427,"Maybe I'm just nostolgic, but the first entry in the Borderlands franchise still has a charm for me that it's sequel didn't possess, despite numerious gameplay improvements, and a much, much bigger gameworld. This game claimed an embarassingly large slice of my life, and I although I haven't fired it up in a few years, I still google the intro cinematic (""No Rest for the Wicked"" by Cage the Elephant) and watch it all over again sometimes."
12428,Great Game!
12429,shit game
12430,Tedious grind with a golf clapping loot god
12431,Great fun with friends.
12432,"Good game. Gets old fairly quickly, even playing co-op.
Nothing Earth-shattering, like many people claim."
12433,8/10. Better with friends.
12434,Play Borderlands. It's a good game.
12435,"I currently have 5 hours logged in this game so far and I thoroughly enjoy it. not only are the RPG elements spot on and engaging, but the characters are fun and vibrant, the art style is silly and cartoonish while also keeping up with gore and violence."
12436,"This is an All-time favorite game of mine, It is packed with hours upon hours of fun, full of rich content that will keep you gaming for days on end. The DLC's are definitely worth picking up if you haven't purchased the GOTY edition as they not only increase the level cap to 69 but give you many more quests to complete and items to obtain. I gotta admit though, this game is way more fun if you play it with your friends because the more players that play with you, the better loot you will get which will be a better rewardable experience and of course the difficulty increase makes things more challenging which really puts your items to the test. Overall, I give this game a 10/10 for the gameplay, the graphics, and for the gazillion items you can obtain!"
12437,"The game is fun. It is a shooter with some rpg elements. It has its own unique style. It does have some problems with DLC. They decided to sell people on the base game and then offer the GOTY version for the same price. Effectively screwing people who had bought the game earlier.

The game is a little grindy, but fun.

I'd recommend picking up the GOTY version for $5.

I will update this review to be more in-depth at a later time."
12438,"There ain't no rest for the wicked...
Borderlands.
Cartoony, very interesting art style.
Guns, ammo, robots!
FPS + RPG Gameplay, if you like those kinds of games, and like the art style, or at least tollerate it, then this is FOR YOU!
9/10 Awesome game
Although to play online you must make a NEW gamespy account in-game and it will work. BUT if you try to auto login it will enter the wrong password so you'll have to retype it."
12439,"Never understood the obsession people had with this game, until I sat down and played it, and really got into it. Just about the best single player game I've played!"
12440,I have re-played this game most times than any other. Since there are four characters with different abilities and several campaings the replay value is significant. The mostly random gun drops also add variability to the gameplay.
12441,"When the game initially released I was not even remotely interested but as time passed and I eventually bought it I was pleased that I did. Granted the humor in the first Borderlands is dull or drab at time but most of it is pretty good.

The game plays well and often makes the player feel a sense of accomplishment when completing serious quest lines.
If you plan on playing Borderlands 2 then I suggest starting off with its roots here."
12442,"This...this game, it's the first fps I ever liked, it's crazy fun for the whole...hum not family but yeah, it is THE most amazing fps ever made, apart from borderlands 2.Also, if you have the money for it buy borderland 2 since it's just a better version but I still recommend."
12443,"A great game, and while the story was good, the writing is amazing in the dlcs, honestly worth playing just for those.  The second one fixes a lot of problems this game had, but this game is still awesome."
12444,"while not nearly as fun as the second game, this game is worth your while for the modded x8 multiplier SMG's and willowtree alone.
buy it if you want something else to satisfy your borderlands urge."
12445,"Diablo meeds COD, without all the unfun crap. It is worth beating at least once if for no other reason than to unlock the ultimate vault hunter pack in 2."
12446,"Awesome game. I don't know why but I wasn't that excited for it in the beginning, but I decided to buy it on a steam sale and I kind of regreted not buying it sooner. Highly recommend it!"
12447,Do it!
12448,"Do you like guns?
Do you like numbers?
Well then your in luck as Borderlands has them by the chest-full.

'Shoot and loot' and 'Role-Playing Shooter', these are the two things that best define Borderlands. It's a first-person shooter with RPG elements. You level up, earn loot (guns, sheilds, grenade mods etc) and go on quests. There is a story to it, but it takes a backseat as you will be focused on hunting down shiny pieces of aluminum that shoots more digits than your previous piece of aluminum.

All in all, Borderlands is a game created for people who like to compare and see increases in numbers while boasting to their friends."
12449,I recommend this game! Fair warning uses GameSpy.
12450,"Fairly fun and vibrant shooter. The gameplay gets old soon enough thanks to boring enemies and the fact that you only have one special skill, which isn't even that interesting. A bit more fun in multiplayer, but I think it conflicts with the single player structure of the game, so I was never able to enjoy it that way."
12451,"InTERSANTE,ORIGNAL Y BUENISIMO PARA JUGAR CON AMIGOS 9/10"
12452,"This game is stunning. It is a roleplay game that you will never get bored of, get it now."
12453,"I was very addictided to this game, especially as I played nearly all of it on co-op with another great player. 
All the DLC apart from Moxxi's one I enjoyed as well, I would really have loved more.

Over all I have prefered this one to it's sequel which I have very nearly finished"
12454,"This game is not as big as i would have liked, there is repetitiveness to it,but im enjoying it, a great game to pick up on sale and the co-op is done well"
12455,"i had never heard of this game seemed alittle weird avoided it for awhile then got it cheap decided to go for it,honestly one of the best games i ever played.great story lots to do.some really weird charecters,just all around weird fun game.highly recomend,and the most bang for a buck the hours ive logged are from one playthru.and 1 extra dlc i still have more to go.highly recomend 10 out of 10!!"
12456,The first of it series. That make us know the feeling of co-op shoot it all out with friend.
12457,"This is a game which is kinda ground breaking to have a FPS with loot and leveling up.  In some ways its a shame its only weapons, but when you are in it you don't mind.  Its a bit slow at first, but once you are used to the artwork it gets going.   Its a great game, however once I got to the max level and did everything, I knew I'd never repeat that with another class.  It loses some points for that.

3rd and 4th DLC are the highlights.  The arena one is the worst by far.

Overall a must play for FPS fans"
12458,"Fps/rpg game with many weapons, items and quests.4 Characters/classes with different skills. FUN."
12459,"bang bang bang loot loot loot, not much else to say."
12460,"Borderlands Review.

*Note: Review based on PS3 version.

Borderlands is the game you may have dreamt of when you were younger (minus the gore!). A big open world to explore, a multitude of quests, and cartoon graphics in an age of gritty realism. What's not to like?

The only downside to Borderlands is the fact it is basically a tech demo for things to come. But when you step onto Pandora, you forget about that, you just exist in this fascinating world that has been laid out for you. Sure, the lack of a solid story can and will disappoint you at times, but once you allow yourself to be immersed in this non conventional world, you will be hooked.

I say non conventional, because really it is not your typical FPS game. Nor your typical ARPG. It's almost a new genre, where all you do is loot, shoot and loot some more. Never have I felt so restricted in my choices to carry loot I find, but this is a good thing. You are given a steady stream of improving weapons and upgrades that encourage you to change how you play on the fly. This really gives the game longetivity and prolonged enjoyability, it just doesn't get stale.

The graphics, the world, the characters, the audio. All are wonderfully utilised in creating this game. You may find yourself shooting the same enemies over and over again, but that makes it even more exciting to find the ""badass"" version of them, and to beat the virtual stuffing out of them.

Borderlands will continue to entertain you hours after you start playing. It is a funny, tough, exciting, non stop thrill ride (that's right, cliché time) from start to finish. In short, you need to buy this game. Come on, visit Pandora. Who know's what you'll find here....

9/10
Excellent"
12461,"This game requires you to have a sense of humor and the desire for loot...a huge desire for loot. So if you like shooting things, looting items, and not taking things so seriously, there is no more to think about."
12462,SHUT UP AND BUY THIS GAME
12463,9/10 awesome game
12464,"
Great game that blends rpg and shooter elements perfectly. Highly addictive playing co-op. 8.8/10"
12465,Awesome FPS with awesome loot. Unless you've got an asshole teammate who ninja loots
12466,one of the first FPS games to actually be unique
12467,"good game, either for single or co-op"
12468,Loot based semi-free-roam RPG FPS with thousands of weapons and mods for each. - If you like the idea of a Pistol with a 3x scope and bullets that set people on fire. buy this.
12469,"Brilliant game. An open world with hundreds of missions and dozens of achievements. Great skill tree system and hundreds of weapons. What more could you ask for? Oh and by the way, the characters and dialouge are hilarious. A must-play."
12470,so badass!
12471,!!!!
12472,"This game is average, I would give it a 7/10"
12473,addictive as hell.
12474,"Top FPS game, good fun and lots of witty hurmour... A game that you'll play for hours and the graphics really bring the life of Pandora to your PC.."
12475,"Very fun game! 
Players start the game with the ability to equip two weapons but later gain up to four weapon slots, as well as slots for an energy shield, a grenade modification, and a class modification. Items collected can be sold back at vendors for money that then can be used to buy better items. One of the key features of Borderlands is the randomly-generated weapons and items created either as dropped by enemies, found in storage chests about the game, on the ground, sold at vendors in the game, or as quest reward items."
12476,Just genius
12477,COD
12478,"THIS GAME IS AWESOME, BUT DORDERLANBS 2 IS WAY BETTERRRRRRR"
12479,"Pretty much unlimited guns. Fantastic humor and unigue graphics. Buy this game duck sucka!!!!!!! Get GOTY though, you will regret missing out on this fantastic dlc that is with the GOTY."
12480,"Well this game is okay. The graphics are nice, the dialouge are hilarious. But I think Borderlands 2 is much better."
12481,Got this in the Halloween Sale for £4.99 + All DLC's. It has been great so far.
12482,"The art style and the atmosphere is what makes the game, better than the second game in my opinion."
12483,This Game got me hooked on the Franchise. I now have about 600 hour or so in to Borderlands 2 and couldn't Wait untill this came out! I am having a blast!
12484,хорошая игруля. веселая все дела.
12485,Amazing game and such good humour!
12486,"What a great mix of rpg and action, with a great sense of humour and a gameplay that gets you hooked on it."
12487,"Nice game, had a really fun time playing this game. Had a bunch of funny parts. One of the best FPS games out their. And that claptrap is really funny. Can't wait to play Borderlands 2 when i get the chance. I really did enjoy this game and the story was really interesting. This game can be both single player and multiplayer Co-op with the ability to level up ur character and their special skills"
12488,"Не плохая стрелялка, можно поиграть вместе
"
12489,"So much fun, so many guns, so many enemys, so great, so awesome. WOW!"
12490,A bitchin FPS game infused with RPG elements. The best part would be it's looting system. ohhh gun that gun this gun everywhere on top of their awesome artistic style.
12491,Best Co-op game eu!
12492,I cannot recommend this game enough. My brother and I used to play some awesome multiplayer on splitscreen. My cousin and I and a few others did online play. I did tons of hours of solo play. Play shmay get the game today thats what I say.
12493,"This game caught me by surprise. When I heard ""Role Playing Shooter"" I was expecting something like Fallout: New Vegas. What I got was a funny, fast paced game that seems influenced by MMOs. The most fun I had with borderlands was playing the online co-op with friends, and just having a good time. The randomized weapons and amount of quests is fun, however the lack of fast travel can be a little tedious, but with friends, traveling is never really an issue."
12494,"One of the best RPG shooters. Nice soundtrack, interesting story and lots of guns..
Really fun to play in co-op, but all have to be on same quest (otherwise its not so fun [and this is the big minus to game]). After you complete game on playthrough 1, you can start playthrough 2 and do challenges in game, arenas and many other stuff. All achievements worth to do, also game have many references to other games, TV serials, movies and so on..  So you can easy repeat it few times and still find something new and interesting.. My grade will be 9/10."
12495, 
12496,"Still an all around solid game, for sure one of my favourites."
12497,"Borderlands took many by surprise as it was one of the first game to introduce a loot-infested addiction in first person form. Whilst it graphics have come to age and its story is non-existent it makes up for these shortcomings with addicitive gameplay.

Although it has been successed by Borderlands 2, this is where it all started. Just make sure to bring a few friends if you truly want to experience what Borderlands has to offer."
12498,"A fun sandbox mode game. It is made for four actual players on multiplayer as playing on single player, is just wrong. There are four characters to choose from, each having their own specific abilities. The game setting is comedic and surreal. The quest system is very very simple as you read the message and go on your merry way. There are some cut scenes which is sometimes the most you will ever see. The items are randomly generated as well as the rarity. There is no set item with set rarity but a item with randomized stats which is unique. 80% you will be spending your time driving around in the free vehicles you can get at the vehicle station. Though with most of the entrances to the quests there will be road blocks or level changes that will not have the vehicle station. For the most part all the quests are repetitive and boring. While there are a few surprises with the bosses but other than that, not really interesting. Point to note that the DLC might provide a better experience but i found them more or less repetitive. The game does have RPG elements as you can level up and choose abilities. The ability to buy items is also an asset but really all you will be doing is buying ammunition."
12499,A RPG game that I expected to be boring and miserable... but it blowed my mind instead.
12500,the game is sweet. the shootings are bomb. guns keep falling out of your face. what more can you ask for? what more can you ask... from life? 10/10
12501,"Shooter, RPG, Loots, fun graphics, fun times, lots of trolling ... what is there not to like about the game? Sure the UI/inventory is kludgey, and you have to actually click a button to pick things up, but that is really being nitpicky when the glaring overpowering fact is that this game rocks hard."
12502,Haven't played Borderlands 2 yet. But this game is two f words: Fun and frantic in all the best ways. Nothing better than blasting through midgets with a shotgun.
12503,"Nice game with a good OST and freakingly quick gameplay sometimes, recommended."
12504,"No, just no."
12505,"In my opinion, this is THE greatest co-op gaming experience you could ever have. The replayability is unlimited, and I myself have logged hundreds of hours into Borderlands on the Xbox 360. It's one of my all-time favorites, and a game that I will go back to again and again.

My Rating: 8.5/10"
12506,better than its sequel in multiple ways that im sure a few people on my friends list would like to educate you about.
12507,A game that will get on your nerves....
12508,I can't stop playing this game! It's so fun! And it works well on my computer on low settings!
12509,"Borderlands is a fantastic game. Whether you play alone or with three of your buddies, youre definately going to add on hours fast. The story is that youre basically looking for a vault filled with treasure from a long told legend, ""The Legend of The Vault."" You can choose to play as one of four characters, all with unique traits and special abilities. The gameplay is very solid and super fun. You begin at level one and progress earning experience points by killing things, completing quests, and finishing challenges. One more thing, LOOT!! Loot plays a huge role in this game. There are rarity levels(White - Green - Blue - Purple - Orange) of loot and many types of equipment ranging from shields and grenades to rifles and rocket launchers. The game also generates thousands of weapons at all rarity types so the probability of finding the same weapon is near to impossible.

8.8 out of 10"
12510,"As horrifically unbalanced as this game is, Gearbox Software had made it really fun to scour Pandora in search of loot and glory; it's like Diablo FPS!"
12511,It's cool.
12512,"What are you doing here? Game is boring crap.

 Don't waste your time and go now to the Borderlands 2 steam page and buy it now!"
12513,"If you like shooters, and you like RPGs, and you have a special place in your heart for post apocolyptic wastelands, Borderlands might be for you."
12514,"Thick black outlines and guns. What could be better.
"
12515,"Even though I don't normally enjoy first-person shooters, Borderlands manages to grip me due to its basic RPG progression design. While the graphics are a bit dated at this point, and some of the missions later in the game tend towards the tedious side, the game is a breath of fresh air due to its combination of bright palette, humor and character level-ups.  8/10"
12516,"PC port is TERRIBLE. Go to pcgamingwiki.net and search for this game to find fixes for various problems.
I would reccomend the second game over this, its better in every way."
12517,I've been putting this game off for a while...Time to jump on the Bandwagon!
12518,"I prefer this game over Borderlands 2, in my opinion it has much less forced comedy, feels less watered down, and I prefered these classes and characters. The colors leave much to be desired though, BL2 added more colors than all 50 shades of brown to the world, but it is what it is. Fantastic game, especially in co- op, but still a great time solo."
12519,would not recommend to people with anti-bat syndrome.
12520,"Loot, loot, loot!.."
12521,BENG!
12522,"Jogo muuuuuito bom pra se jogar em coop, super grande, garante muiiitas horas de jogatina alucinada !!"
12523,Borderlands captured my attention in a great way. So many memories of this game and playing with friends.
12524,"FPS, lots of items, some bosses. The quests are simple repetitive ones they get monotonous after awhile. The animation/graphics are unique. Pretty good if its on sale otherwise check out borderlands 2 first. I hear it has some improvments"
12525,"visit Pandora, and you'll never leave or die trying... still a nice place to visit"
12526,"Some of the DLC add-ons for this game are equivalent to almost an entire game. The game play is pretty decent, co-op is fun."
12527,"This reveiw is more aimed at people who bought Borderlands 2 first, like me, and enjoyed it, like me, and want to see where it came from. After really enjoying BL2 i thought this would be just as good, and i found myself to be wrong. If you want to i wont stop you but i definatly would say that this is nowhere near as good. Its feels empty and they dont have a difficult curev but have mountins instead. some areas are near impossable untill you are a really high level, and these points come far to early, but the end game is far to easey respectivly"
12528,I JUST CAN'T DEAL with the GUI.. played BL2 first.. now this looks like a  zx spectrum  GUI. everything enviroment wise is exactly the same which i really like.. except the GUI.. its sooo ugly. tried online to find a mod to put the second one in the first.. but not surprisingly to no avail. .. I wanna complete this too.. aghaghagah first world problems. im being stupid and picky.. i know but cant stop myself.
12529,"This has really revolutionized the first person shooter by adding RPG elements like Dungeon Exploring, skill trees based on different character classes, and epic loot. It is a must have for sure."
12530,Amazing!!! Just Amazing!!!
12531,"This is a really fun single-player and co-op shooter. Funny dialog and comic-style art definitely don't hurt the game. The downside is it ends up becoming pretty repetitive with all the tasks you have to do. Go here, retrieve this, kill that, get loot, repeat. It's still fun times, though, so grab a friend and have at it!"
12532,RPG + FPS + Tons of action + Tons of Humor = Tons of Fun
12533,"Borderlands is well developed, combat and story driven, and wonderfully animated. The difficulty curve is very reasonable. The game is more challenging the more people you play with--which is awesome because the loot is significantly better. Also, both the LAN and interwebs options are great for multi-player. Plus: Brick. Need I say more?"
12534,"If you have still not played this game, you are wasting so many hours of fun you could be having right now! Buy the GOTY edition, it is worth it."
12535,"I beat Borderlands a while back and I forgot to write a recommendation. Play it. Seriously, go and buy it right now. This game is barrels of fun. Some may argue the shooting is very repetitive, but it is the different guns and enemy difficulty that mixes things up for me. The variety of guns is great, and eventually you will find your favorite weapon combinations. The ending was terrible though. If you want a great ending then you probably won't be too satisfied (as I was) but the gameplay makes up for it. All in all, this game is basically an MMO, but without other guilds and players, and in this game I actually enjoyed doing fetch quests!"
12536,I recommend this game. It's fun
12537,"Great game.
Good storyline.
Fun shooting.
Funny conversations.

Overall 9/10 for me"
12538,Loot-A-Rama!!!!!!! Great FPS action!
12539,"very good, very fun, very nice, very interesting"
12540,"Best theme music for a game - I've only played a few hours, but I'll be back someday."
12541,★★★★★
12542,"Только благодаря кооперативу на четырех человек, и загружаемым DLC, 6 из 10. КРЕПКИЙ СРЕДНЯЧОК."
12543,"If you like gory, crazy, hilairious adventures, this game is for you!"
12544,"Great game, great soundtrack !"
12545,Insanely fun. Play with friends in co-op mode. It is hilariously fun with friends especially.
12546,More epic than a monkey in a suit. Now that's something.
12547,"This game has been around for quite a while now, but it is still great!
The cell shading graphics stand up to the test of time. The selection of weapons is great enough that everyone can find there perfect setup. 4 playable characters with 3 skill trees each still ensures players enough diversity to replay. Very nice that they included a ""new game +"" feature automatically.
I am a little unsure about the DLC, though it is great I still have to ask if they intendend on that or if they decided to create more content based on player demand.
I have gotten many an hour of enjoyment from this game and I am sure you will too!

Graphics 88/100
Gameplay 98/100
Sound/Music 96/100

I concur good sir, now please, stop weeing on little girls."
12549,Das Spiel ist Hammer Geil die Grafik ist der Hammer ich kann das Spiel nur empfehlen wer auf Alien shooter steht sollte sich das unbedingt holen. Es ist auch nicht schwer durch zu spielen.
12550,plain awesome
12551,"Amazing story, great graphics, awesome loot! I wont repeat; Play BORDERLANDS!"
12552,"Funny FPS with great graphics and lots of weapon variety, although later in the game you see a lot of junk weapons, and missions become long and tedious."
12553,is very gud
12554,"Borderlands 1 is the prequel to Borderloands 2. 

I don't know, I played like 2 minutes of this game then thought ""Why the hell am I playing this when I have Borderloands 2?"" so I uninstalled it and never played it again. 

1/6 for thats how long i played. I know I said two minutes before, but that's become some sort of stupid joke that I keep making. I'm sure I won't find it funny in a year or TWO. 

Make sure to get rich black friend to gift for u. Otherwise, by a a sailboat."
12555,"Borderlands is a sci-fi western role playing first person shooter with a looting system that you can find alot of dosh(money), ammo, and useful or useless guns along the way, gearbox made this game quite suprising with hardcore, the game has four characters will their own skills that you can play, this game takes around 10 or 15 hours to beat i don't how long is it, there are bounty boards where you can try earn some XP for your character plus money and a bonus weapon, some bounties have their own difficulties if you want play it on normal challanges or harder ones but i would go with harder ones because the more hard exprience you do the more looting of money and guns you'll get, if it happens that you look like western, sci-fi, RPG, and FPS then borderlands would be suitable for you, i give this a 9 out of 10 (i can't wait to get Borderlands 2 thou i don't if i'm gonna get it on steam because i heard the annoucement for gearbox that they're porting the game the ps vita next year which i want a ps vita, so which should i get? pc version or vita verison? let me know on the comments below)"
12556,Trés bon moins cher que le 2 et déja top
12557,completely awesome play this
12558,Fun on a bun!
12559,awesome game! all my saves dissapeared... ty valve!
12560,"It took a very long time for me to get into Borderlands. Constant advertising and an unease with its relatively novel graphical style left me unwilling for some time, but eventually, at the urging of a friend, I finally took the plunge. The game has since become one of the more memorable titles in my gaming history.

By now, everyone knows Borderlands; it is often considered one of the best mergers of shooter and RPG, as it features fast-paced combat with an expansive list of firearms a first-person shooter should offer, and the pursuit of experience, new equipment, and missions that RPGs simply cannot go without. Weapons are procedurally generated from a list of parts, offering much variety in both statistics and feel, while enemies are numerous and diverse, all often incorporating uncommon ""Badass"" mini-bosses that add further challenge to ordinary skirmishes.

One thing that always stuck out about Borderlands in my mind was its charm. Gearbox found a pleasant mix of serious and comedic influences, allowing the player to simultaneously laugh and find a measure of immersion in the story around them. While, admittedly, the game is often quiet and features a number of dull, run-of-the-mill side missions, most with little or no voice acting to offer a sense of character, the setting and even balance of its tone continues to strike a chord with me even long after retiring from the game.

Unfortunately, what Gearbox didn't quite get right with Borderlands was balance. Weapons are quickly invalidated by level, balance between player classes is often questionable, and comparison between the different weapon element types can often find itself uneven.
In example, playing as a Soldier alongside a Siren often made me feel as though my weapons were borderline useless by comparison. Only by experience and familiarity with shooters was I able to make myself feel like a contributing asset rather than a health point hose.
In other cases, trying to use regular weapons to suit all occasions didn't feel like I was sacrificing a little to be ready for everything; it felt like I was sacrificing nearly everything to be ready for very isolated incidents. Even in situations where weapons of a specific element were intended to fall short - such as an incendiary weapon firing on a shielded enemy - it still gave the impression that using a normal weapon was an inferior choice.

Additionally, it feels hard to call Borderlands a title designed for the PC. Always-on voice chat, difficulties in getting the game to obey my settings, and one of the clunkiest menus I've used on a PC leave little to the imagination when considering how much effort was invested where.

Overall, Borderlands has earned its place in my library. While I have since worn the game thin and left it to collect the dust of nostalgia, it is a title that I will not think twice about revisiting should the opportunity arise."
12561,Besser als...
12562,MUST BE PLAYED WITH FRIENDS.
12563,"If you like FPS games and Diablo style games then get this, because that's exactly what it is."
12564,"I fell in love with this game, I want more games made the same way! Fps-rpg-coop... Choose a character, choose your combat style, complete missions, join your friends in battle, on path to the vault, ... get DLC's or simply buy the GOTY edition because only the main story won't be enough for you, trust me... but like in any other game which is meant to be played in multiplayer, it is about the people you play it with. Which doesn't mean that singleplayer is not fun, you totally gain some new gaming experience during this game.

12569,"Este juego es una maravilla....e jugado muchas veces, solo o con amigos, y la verdad una vez que empiezo a jugar me puedo pegar horas, ademas tiene bastante duracion y si te compras las expansiones pues tienes unas cuantas horas mas aseguradas, en total te digo yo que con los dlc y la campaña normal si haces el 1º y 2º recorrido tienes mas de 100 horas aseguradas, a no ser que por algún motivo no te guste este juego, pero si te gustan los shooter en primera persona este juegazo no te va a decepcionar, tiene niveles, variedad de armas, mounstruos etc..."

12572,"A game which more or less defined the ""looter-shooter"" genre. What else you would want?"
12573,Nunca pensei que ia ficar tão aficionado em um jogo/serie como fiquei com Bordelands. Gosta de jogos de tiro em 1º pessoa? Gosta de jogos de RPG? Fica a sugestão para dar uma olhada com mais calma nesse titulo.
12574,"love this game!
"
12575,"you guys have to pick up this one if you dont already own it by now, the DLCs are amazing ive beat them all, and the game is still satisfying"
12576,"It's really difficult NOT to recommend the original Borderlands.  At the price it is now and with as much content that goes into it, you'll be busy for a while.  Between the mixup of RPG and FPS coupled with the humor that is in every pore of this game and mixed with the fact that having several peeps going with you at once makes for a pretty great combo that wil easily suck the time out of it that you put into it.  This was probably the game that got me into modern-day FPSes."
12577,this games was my favorite game from the time that i got it to the time i got borderlands 2 and it is still fun to play especially with the loot and gun systems being the best in the series and the ambiant noises are really nice to listen to compared to the techno/dubstep that is the norm today
12578,"My personal favorite game of all time. I recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS, RPG, and/or sandbox games. The graphical style/art style is original and refreshing and lends itself to the atmosphere of the game. The General Knoxx DLC is amazing too, with lots of time and effort put into it. All in all, BL is a fantastic game and, if you haven't tried it yet for some reason, do it!"
12579,Best...Game...Evaaaaaaaar...............................
12580,"GAME OF THE YEAR EDITION!!!!
ohhhh baby eugggg (orgasm noise)"
12581,Adicting as HELL
12582,I got this for free and I still feel like i was scammed.
12583,"Yeah nah. I had high hopes for this game. The 'shoot at the enemy until it dies' philosophy is more prevalent here than most any other game I've seen.

It's the perfect storm of: No real need to seek cover, all enemies are bullet sponges, most abilities amount to ""+% extra damage or accuracy or health or willy size"", all the weapons are pretty generic and boring (despite being randomly generated), no real character customization (in terms of appearance or ability (builds usually amount to 'punching guy' or 'shooting guy')), boring and repititive locations, bland narrative, annoying attempts at humor.

The graphics style is kind of cool, and the idea of putting in a diablo-esque loot system into a FPS is also kind of cool (even if it doesn't work too well). But not even co-op could make this game interesting.

Bland bland bland. Just bland. Bland as fuck."
12584,"Updated review.

Borderlands has to be one of the best RPG's that utilises guns out there. It's up my list with STALKER and Fallout, though the settings here are completely different!

9/10 art style and personality; very original all around and it sticks with you; funny and relaxed; the only game that has a better personality is I think Portal 

8/10 sound effects, music, voice; it all blends in to form this captivating world

8/10 game mechanics; leveling like the classic RPG's have, meaning getting imba in just a few levels and also grinding IS part of the game, guns are fun to customize, combat is visceral with varied enemies and missions, quests are a little boring they look  more like MMO quests but there is a multiplayer option which is the best way to play with a few friends

Not that different from Borderlands 2. You're getting the same experience if you play BL1

Not very immersive, but extremely fun to play. Great multiplayer. It can really drain hours from your life without you noticing at all."
12585,"This is by far one of the best first-person shooting role-playing games out there. The plot is interesting and unexpected, the weapons are countless, the enemies are numerous, and side missions are almost always available. One of the most appealing aspects of this amazing game is the mature atmosphere and dark humor. The dialogue is filled with innuendoes, raunchy jokes, and satire, all provided by caricaturesque NPCs. Overall, the game is great, from the very beginning to the last DLC. My only complaint is that there is not much challenge to the game due to the fact that there is only one difficulty setting and just so long as you don't rush through and complete only the main missions, you won't have much of a problem with dying or dealing with difficult enemies. Other than that, this is definitely a game I consider you play."
12586,all i have to say migets
12587,"Awesome, skags and bandits all day."
12588,"Only redeeming quality was the gun variation.

Incredibly buggy: NPC speech cutting out randomly, car flipping over randomly, getting stuck in geometry meaning I have to start back from the beginning of whatever area I entered, quest markers not updating sometimes.

Solo play, as expected because Borderlands 2 is out and nobody plays this anymore, is boring and tedious as hell. I don't know how the other characters play (I played through as soldier), but after forcing myself to complete this trainwreck I don't want to ride it again. It's that bad that I don't even want to start any of the DLC.

The ending is the worst part of it, however. CONGRATS YOU KILLED THE TENTACLE THING! HERE'S SOME MONEY, NOW GO FUCK OFF SOMEWHERE.

Although I only clocked in around 24 hours with this playthrough, it feels like I've wasted a lot more time than that."
12589,A good choice. Is addictive game with a good story and a realist graphics. Recommend buying dlc.
12590,"Gamespy killed the multiplayer coop in this game. If you are looking for a better coop experience, consider getting borderlands 2."
12591,"Eh, I can't really say anything about this game. I only played it for about like 3-4 hours and still didnt beat it. Deleted it from my computer, but if you insist. Game was amazing from my perspective and to say from 3-4 hours, well it was a blast and I was not bored at any time!"
12592,"This, with the DLC's is heaven, you'll have the greatest time ever :D"
12593,"29 saat sonra sıkıyor, tek olumsuz yanı bu. :)"
12594,"Borderlands is a very meh game. The story sucks **Spoiler** The cake is a lie! **Spoiler**. Only the Jacob's Guns are the best guns. Also about 50 or so gun models with different stats, not a Billion guns. The characters are good. Most the Missions sucked. Sucks if play by yourself, needs aleast 1 other friend to be enjoyable. 6/10"
12595,Покупайте для совместного веселья самое то!!!
12596,cool
12597,"Shoot, Loot, Level up, and complete Quests."
12598,Ain't no rest for the wicked! Simply awesome!!
12599,"Imagine a single (or multiplayer) rpg with MMO style loot and quests, a Fallout sense of humor, a Nerf gun-style arsenal and a Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels/Snatch essence of dramatic narrative.   If that sounds good to you, then pick up the Borderlands Game of the Year Edition."
12600,funny coop game
12601,"It only took me 3 years or so to really appreciate Borderlands but, once I came around, it was an addictive ride from beginning to end.  It's rough around the edges, with a poor console interface and some annoying bugs and design decisions, but it's still unadulterated shoot-and-loot fun."
12602,2보다 재미없어.
12603,"Stupidly great game, single player, or co-op. Recommend Co-op for extra goodies and fun"
12604,"There is nothing to say about borderlands, everyone knows that it is awesome."
12605,"Very good FPS crossed with an RPG. You can get quests from various people and ""Bulletin Boards"" throughout the world and gain XP and loot from those missions. You gain levels just like in your RPG games and use the skill points you gain every level (1 per level) to upgrade your skills which increase your characters abilities. Very solid game with just endless hours of fun to be had. Highly recommended."
12606,Great cooperative shooter!
12607,"A game with a close to endless amount of different guns, extremely awesome characters, big ass world, tons of quests, levels and skills, a cool graphic style and lots of DLC's to keep the fun going... fun and entertaining for hours, but really shines with friends in ko-op!
Awesome game and a must-buy, especially when on sale."
12608,"BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
"
12609,"Borderlands is a first person shooter with strong role playing elements set on a distant and hostile planet.
You play as one of four mercenaries who have come to the planet of Pandora seeking the legendary “Vault” and its many promised treasures.
There are four different characters to choose from in Borderlands, each with their own set of skill and abilities. The four characters include Lilith ""The Siren"", Mordecai ""The Hunter"", Brick ""The Berserker"" and Roland ""The Soldier"". 
The missions and side quests can be quite rewarding in Borderlands and allows characters to score all sorts of loot and weapons to help them accomplish the game's main objective.
In the multiplayer co-op mode up to four players can choose any one of the characters and play through the same single player campaign.
Borderlands is an excellent mix of RPG elements without sacrificing FPS game play. It is a perfect choice to play with your friends, definitely worth to buy.

12610,"Borderlands has a wonderfully attractive art design and wasteland atmosphere but as a game it's a bit so-so. There's tons of content and the game's RPG elements are pretty cool once you get a hang of them but during most of the game's quests you're constantly trying to shake off the feeling of pointlessness, a problem only exacerbated by those long stretches of travel between quests. The game's plot is very thin and doesn't even feel relevant until the very end."
12611,"GRAB YOUR GUNS GRAB A CLAPTRAP GRAB YOUR FRIENDS AND SHOOT MIDGETS AND SKAGS!

tho, the constant quest hunting is a little rough on the edges ;) not much else is to be said honestly. i love this game, but its tireing to play in the end.

7/10"
12612,"A great open world game with unique weapon choices, many interesting creatures to destroy and four distinct classes each with an upgradeable special power. Unlock your inner Vault Seeker today :3"
12613,Love this game!
12614,If you like to explode Badass Psycho midgets then this is the game for you.
12615,Really good in coop.
12616,This game is Awesome. Old (2009) and I enjoying it so far. Owner of Borderlands 2 before this and I admit this game got some awesome coop experience. Its fun.
12617,Just flat out fun. Why did I wait so long to get this game?
12618,"Really damn fun to play. It has it's glitches and moments of pure derp, but overall, very fun to play. Highly recommend playing co-op with at least one person, not just to make it easier to play through, but to make it more interesting. Being in constant competition to find the best gun makes you want to explore the map more for any weapon crates in the area, which makes the gameplay that much more fun. The controls are a bit wonky at times, like you cant sprint and go from holding W to holding WD so you can look left and not turn, without having to press sprint again, and the general FOV is efawvsdfbhdubgjdfgnfvc bad. But, the voice lines are funny, combat is pretty good, and missions make you explore much of the maps, so this game is definitely a must. (Screw scavenge missions, just, screw them, and the compass, screw that too.)"
12619,"When Borderlands 2 came out and I FINALLY played it, I found myself dissapointed. COmming from this game, I expected so much more form BL2. But after going back to my roots, I found myself with Borderlands as more of a guilty pleasure. Not too many people play it anymore because they're too busy with BL2, but comming back to this game and playing through it again gave me a warm feeling inside. Other than the let-down at the end, I feel Borderlands is a Game worth looking into."
12620,"Approaching the last respectable thing Gearbox ever put out, it has a severe issue with the game being terribly boring if you don't play it with friends, and it has a visual aesthetic ripped wholesale from a guy's CG short from a few years before the game's release.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efj-v3ugbbc
That said, the game can at least be praised for trying something new in the area of attempting to hybridize the gameplay of an FPS with the gameplay of a Diablo-like, to success best measured by individual.

Going in, I suppose I should give you a few sage words of advice.
Buy the four pack, buy the GOTY edition, and buy it on sale.
Otherwise, this one really isn't worth your time.

Oh, and for fuck's sake, avoid the sequel. What little respect I can give this one is just totally uprooted by that thing."
12621,"A must-have classic of RPG FPS games. It's got humor, it's got gore, and it's got an inventive story, even if it is a bit lackluster in terms of the RPG element. If you're looking for a great game that'll give you hours and hours of play time before you hit any DLC, this is for you. 

In regards to the DLC itself, Zombie Island is a bit dull after a time and has no teleport hubs besides the one to enter/leave the DLC area of Jakobs Cove. However it's great for XP and gear farming and it does have some pretty funny moments. Underdome is very lackluster, don't bother. General Knoxx DLC is good and difficult but once again suffers from no teleport hubs and has a LOT of driving involved(likely to showcase the new vehicle type you cannot use outside the DLC). Claptrap's Revolution is hilarious, but can certainly get...taxing. Either way they only sell GOTY edition here now so you'll get it all anyway."
12622,The shooty RPG mix that started it all. Good. Get it and play with friends. Very fun.
12623,"Really fun game, tons of guns and a really fun co-op mode
Also big thanks to Cat for buying me this, you're fucking awesome!"
12624,"It's a real good first person shooter, has a kinda dull sandy brown rusted metal color scheme, but as apposed to clashing with the enviroment it makes sense since you are in a massive wasteland planet. and the colors make the characters stand out more. I won't rate this on a numeric scale because that'd be asinine overall it's a great game I really reccomend picking it up when you have the cash. Also, buy the GOTY version as it's cheaper than base game plus DLC."
12625,i love this game
12626,Play this game. A sweet blend of FPS and RPG in a large-open world. The dialogue in this game also offers some hilarious moments. Top-quality.
12627,One of the best FPS you will ever play
12628,Really fun cooperative adventure game. Best with one or more friends. Its sequel is already out so pick this up if you need some backstory.
12629,"Pick one of four unique characters to play with a customisable set of tiered powers (reminiscent of Diablo 2), and load up with a bunch of awesome weapons against a bunch of bat shit crazy enemies. Go it alone or team up with mates over the net to play co-op campaign with the opportunity to annoy and humiliate them in a Duel. Great atmosphere, soundtrack, scenery, gameplay and dialogue awaits the person who jumps in on Borderlands. *****"
12630,Post apocalyptic mayhem in all directions
12631,"Un piccolo capolavoro: se giocato in coop risulta piacevolissimo, data la forte direzione degli sviluppatori per questa forma di gameplay. in singolo potrebbe annoiare alla lunga. rimane sempre e comunque un'esperienza di gioco unica."
12632,"My Fav Co-op Game ever <3 <3 <3
Critical Game xD xD"
12633,It's a very fun game.
12634,Don't buy this.  Just get Borderlands 2 instead.
12635,"FPS game those who like FPS, but maybe aren't good enough to play most fast and furious shooters, combined with RPG elements make this game great fun."
12636,Another excellent co-op game!
12637,"Fun game-play, sometimes ridiculous sense of humor and one of the best map designs in gaming history in my opinion.

Worth noting are DLCs which are as  good as stand alone game itself."
12638,Set the standard in graphics and FUN ...
12639,"Crazy critters, insane weapons, dune buggies, exploding enemies and tattooed freaks who are ACTUALLY ON FIRE BEFORE they attack you. What more can I say? 

I'm not usually one for first person shooters, but this one is hilarious. The over-the-top weaponry (guns that can cause limbs to fly off & heads to explode with one shot!) makes combat darkly funny and the tongue-in-cheek feel of the whole game adds to the free-and-easy, kill-all-you-want -we'll-make-more enjoyment."
12640,Millions of Weapons + RPG elements= Awesome
12641,"Eat the flesh! Salt the wound!

Everyone needs to play this game!"
12642,"This game is amazing!
First of all it is a massive world that you can roam around freely in.
There are uniqe weapons and quests to do.
The enemies are very awesome and put up quite a challenge
The leveling system and skill points make the game realy exciting
There are chests and different kinds of things like safes and vaults to loot.
Different classes to change your experience of the game. 
And the best thing IT IS MULTIPLAYER!!!
And it is under £10.00!"
12643,"A really fun FPS/RPG hybrid. I've played through it twice already, and yet I still love to come back and play again."
12644,"FPS RPG with online, great for co-oping or single player. verynice :)

Would love to see them update this to play more like Borderlands 2."
12645,"Such a great game Crunch had to get it again in Steam so he could let someone else use his physical copy (that and being able to launch it from Steam with no disc needed). Great comobo of FPS, RPG & co-op. And yes, there are over a million different possible weapons. 8.5 out of 10."
12646,"Great, cheap fun and not too processor intensive"
12647,"Borderlands is an awesome mix of FPS and RPG, which can also be played with friends - highly recommended, it makes it more fun - and lets you choose among four different classes with different skills. A very long story mixed with a wonderful gameplay and very comic book like graphics make this one of the best games around."
12648,Fun game!
12649,"Wanted to finish this one first before playing the sequel. And man, this was probably my longest steam game until now. Cost nearly 40 hours and it was repetitive sometime, but still fun, because of the never ending item looting. The RPG elements are great for a shooter, cause I aint that good with this genre. And the RPG stuff kept me playing for a while. Still some guns felt strange because some bullet which would be hit for sure didnt hit.... It could that I suck though..."
12650,This FPS has to be one of the greatest games i have ever played. well worth the money but i didnt play for this. it was a gift from one of my friends. shout out to Auswipe.
12651,very good
12652,Funny and good game where you can explore different types of weapons while exploring and doing missions :)
12653,"Fun game!  It's got a lot of good humor in it and many fun missions.  It took some getting used to, but once I got the hang of the game I enjoyed it.  My only complaint would be the incredibly stupid and enormously disappointing (in my opinion, anyway) ending.  I won't tell you what happens, of course, because I don't want to be a spoiler, but I thought it could have ended better.  But I can see why they ended it the way they did...they needed to be able to make a sequel  :P.   Still, overall it provided hours of fun and entertainment, so I felt it was money well spent.  And who knows...maybe you'll like the ending!"
12654,"If you're not into FPS games, this is the one that will convert you! I LOVED this game. All the guns, the story and scenery, every shot feels like it hit really well...I just loved playing this game. I think the one thing that REALLY kept me going at the start (as I was only playing due to all the hype) was the RPG element and being able to specialise in specific abilities to play in certain ways.

The only thing that I have to complain about are those damn fetch quests: get 5 of this, find this persons lost item, etc and having to grind so much...if I didn't have to level up, this game could've EASILY have been 10 hours shorter. But saying that, I still enjoyed this game alot."
12655,boringlands
12656,"A FPS with an RPG twist, Borderlands took two opposite franchises and created something epic.

The gameplay is smooth, the characters are fantastic (although apart from Clap Trap some names may allude you) and the general feel of the game is one that you can pick up and enjoy anytime you like.

I fully recommend this game no matter what style of games you like but if you are a FPS or RPG fan (maybe both) you will probably get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this one

I also recommend buying the Game of the Year addition for the extra mission, its worth the extra bit of money for it I assure you ^^"
12657,"A cool FPS RPG, if you love quests and dont mind grinding a bit, its really fun and tons of stuff to do as well. Buy the GOTY Edition so you cna play the DLC which is also awesome."
12658,This is definitely a game.
12659,"Kickass good time. Thanks again to Raikaru for getting this for me. The ending is a little shoddy in my personal opinion, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. Borderlands 2 here I come!"
12660,banging your cousin is probably a really bad idea
12661,Borderlands 2 has a great amount of play time and even more with replay value.
12662,"FPS + RPG stuff = FUN whole day!!
VISUAL: 7
GAMEPLAY: 8
AUDIO: 8
FUN: 8
FINAL SCORE: 78"
12663,"get this, the 2nd, the prequel and the third, fools!"
12664,"wtf, this isnt diablo 3"
12665,"Pure Awesomesauce.
RPG blended with First Person Shooter and approx. 2 gajillion different Weapons.

Before playing Borderlands 2 I recommend you play this first."
12666,"Excellent blend of rpg and fps, though be sure to play it co-op."
12667,It's maybe a bit old but it's a heck of a game...
12668,"Fantastic, hours of fun cames from this title"
12669,"Great RPG/FPS mix game. The co-op is integrated seamlessly into the game as well. I love this game and have played 350+ hours. So much fun with some of the DLC. Get this title, get some friends together and spend lots of fun  having a great time. BTW use voice communication to talk to each other. It's more fun to talk to each other and share and the crazy stuff that happens in-game.

Definately recommended, rated 10 out of 10."
12670,"Even you have played Borderland2, you still need try this. It's the source of classic."
12671,"This is a game for the people who love a good RPG, humor, and countless guns, a must play if your into that kind of stuff. However stay away if you don't like repeaditive gamplay and low replayability."
12672,"Ah borderlands we have all played it at one point or another. This is a great game though the controls leave something to be desired I also found it a bit annoying how much I had to run back into town all the time just to continue the story line I wish it had a bit more moving from mission to mission rather than forcing you to keep coming back to town so much to progress in the story kind of left me feeling like it was a bit of a filler. Still I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a FPS the game has a huge list of items and weapons to pick from so you are never left wanting. The fact that it also went a step more by making items a little random was also nice.

Also loved driving around in this game the driving controls in this game were really well made it didnt feel shaky at all unlike some games I have played. Well worth looking into if your after a FPS with a good story line and a good challenge."
12673,"unique, stylish, unusual, beautiful and... multiplayer"
12674,"Port sux but game is fun.

12675,Foda. Simplesmente foda
12676,"Ok, the game gets repetitive at times, and the final boss fight is a joke, but it is a blast playing with friends."
12677,great fun. tons of guns and a unique and awesome art style
12678,"gets really grindy in the latter half of the game.

NEED FRIENDS TO ENJOY.

seriously. this is not a game to play solo."
12679,the original rpg fps loot game
12680,"Fun twitch FPS, might get Borderlands 2 when it gets down to $10."
12681,"You could say that this game's marketing is the reason it became popular - and while the mood of madness and over-the-top feeling is probably the most distinctive thing about it, the game is by no means unworthy of its praise. I just really wish that I had been able to play it when it came out in 2009 and with the full 4-player experience."
12682,This is a wonderful shooter with a ton of personality. Every serious gamer should play this game.
12683,"Guns, more guns, and yet more guns... if you have an insatiable need to shoot things and sift through hundreds upon hundreds of dropped items, in the hopes of finding that one rare gun that's marginally better than the one you already have, then this is most definitely the game for you. Oh, and it's pretty dang fun too. 

Borderlands is a sci-fi loot-fest shooter set on an alien planet. You play as one of 4 ""Vault Hunters"", on a quest to find and open a mythical vault that may or may not hold untold riches. Each of the characters has one unique special skill, plus a set of strengths and weaknesses (better in one weapon type versus another, etc). Unfortunately you can only pick one character at the start of the game, so if you want to try different characters out, you'll have to start multiple games. That kind of sucks, but it's not too big of a deal ultimately, and adds incentive for multiple playthroughs (if you are into making that kind of time investment). The shooting mechanics are pretty good and it's cool how many different types of weapons there are. It allows for tons of experimentation and variety. Gameplay basically consists of discovering a new area, collecting a bunch of quests that need to be fulfilled (though many are optional), completing said quests, getting more loot, leveling up, and proceeding to the next area. Rinse and repeat. Even though that might sound slightly boring on the surface, I assure you it is not. The game mostly stays fresh throughout and the writing is pretty good, bordering on laugh-out-loud funny at times (the game doesn't take itself too seriously). And oh yeah, there's a cute little robot named Claptrap... 'nuff said.

There are a number of DLC campaign add-ons available as well. I believe all of them come with the GOTY edition, but if you don't have that version, I'd say it's worth picking them up after completing the main story (except maybe the Underdome DLC, which I haven't played), assuming you enjoyed the base game. 

In summary, if you like games with a cool sense of humor that involve first-person shooting things and/or lots of loot drops and weaponry, pick this up. It has a great style, good mechanics, and enough content to keep you occupied for many, many hours. A-"
12684,"Wow.
Extremely long, so many missions, loads of achievements, great co-op, bazillions of guns, comical graphics. +1 recommend!"
12685,"This game reminds me of an FPS version of Diablo...random loot, enemy spawns tied to static areas, and a variety of characters to choose from that can be built a number of ways. Good stuff, but leveling is a bit of a pain, and finding the right weapons can be a challenge. Multiplayer smooths the game out quite a bit...but just like any online FPS, the crew determines the smoothness of the ride."
12686,PEW PEW
12687,"Great Shooter, played it like 30h and its still good, cant wait to play Borderlands 2."
12688,"Pure, undiluted fun!!! Must Play!"
12689,"Coming from a guy who didn’t even buy this game himself originally, I actually got this as a gift during December in a server in Gmod where they were doing game giveaways and I won this game. That was 2012 and I played this game for 5-2 minutes and found it so boring I stopped playing and didn’t pick it back up till 2019. I wouldn’t say that it I was entirely wrong as compared to the other Borderlands game this one is a lot more boring and the landscape is way worse. However its still worth playing and is a good game for the most part and you should always give a game more of a try lol… This is the Borderlands that started it all and is still fun 4 player co-op with great characters, skills, guns, enemies, guns, and ok DLCs.

*So from what I can see this is the GOTY only I don’t think you can buy the DLCs separately but hey the price for it all is relatively cheap I mean the game did come out awhile ago. The DLCs for the most part are pretty good and add a lot of new content. 

*If you’re considering buying the Enhanced edition instead it is optimized, better graphics, and overall handles way better however if you buy this game you get the Enhanced for free and you can import your character from this game to the Enhanced version.

+Not on The Epic Store

+Ledge spot for Crawmerax
+Can chat in-game and with mic

-If you have a mic plugged in its automatically on in the game and cannot be turned off unless you unplug it
-Compass being on the bottom of the screen
-Not to compare this game to the second because I think we can all agree that the second is better than the first in every way possible but I just felt Claptrap really annoying in this one, in the second one he’s funny and more in the story and an actual character. In this game after being a tutorial NPC he basically just sits in Fyrestone and tells you whenever there's new quests which he does again and again if you don’t go activate them. Also he’d always do it when I’d be activating them. He’d tell me Crazy Earl has new quests as I’m talking to him just annoying…
- Plot Spoilers including DLCs [spoiler] YET AGAIN not trying to compare this to Borderlands 2, but Handsome Jack is one of the best video game villains ever and was talking to you all game and can be seen multiple times. Commandant Steele was very underwhelming and while I was playing I wasn’t even sure if she was the main antagonist or not. She talks to you twice and you basically only see her physically once to which she died immediately after… Just a really lame main villain was barley in the story and then when Claptrap revives her in the Claptrap DLC she's just a reskin of the Atlas assassins…
-I thought TK Baha’s death was sudden and unnecessary it just felt random and the biggest thing is that you don’t even seek revenge for who did it I thought that was just so blue ballish.
-In the Knoxx DLC you blow up the armory yet you’re able to go back two more times? What was the point of blowing it up like nothing serious was damaged? Also how Knoxx explodes after you kill him yet he's how revived in the next DLC. 
-Claptrap is all of a sudden able to revive and mind control like everyone [/spoiler]
-Shouldn’t be able to sell backpack expanders
-Playing in co-op is annoying how other players who aren’t host can’t interact with certain mission related items, can’t accept and return quests, and overall can see where the quests are for the most part. Also would be better for players who aren’t host and have already finished the current quest on wouldn’t just show as completed for you but in progress
-Arenas glitch sometimes where the enemies spawn outside the arena
-One of the biggest issues I had with this game is how awful the location is. I mean just a barren wasteland for the most part is very basic and boring… no offense. Then you have New Haven which is the major city of the game and it takes place in a landfill and like dear god its like Gearbox wanted the location of the game to be shit.
-Hanz is disturbing looking
-Love it when you go down and all the enemies run away
-Biggest issue I had was the super lame ass quests that require you to like pick up 500+ items over 5 quests. First the one from [spoiler] Zombie TK Baha [/spoiler] who gives you a quest for 25 brains which is ok but then he gives you one for 50, 100, 150, and 250. Like holy fuck so boring and tedious like who enjoyed doing this quest? On top of that the brains don’t even carry over you have to get 50 within the one quest you can’t have 51 and have one carry over for the next just so lame just for an achieve is the only reward. Also why do they drop before the quest even starts you can’t even use them?! Then Marcus gives you the stupid core quest in the Knoxx DLC which ok wasn’t that bad but you’ll most likely not get it finished until you beat the DLC so he then gives you a quest to kill the Crimson Lance members which you’ve been doing all game?? Like just a waste of time and so trivial. “Hey go back and all that shit you just did again.” Then he gives you a quest to return to the armory after you just came from it and it takes too long to drive back that ugh so not worth it and then he does it again… ffs. Then Tannis gives you a similar lame ass quest in the next DLC about the stupid claptrap components. Just like the worst quests ever.
-Horrible map traversal for the Knoxx DLC so much driving and takes forever to go either direction especially when someone gives you a quest to return back to one of the directions takes like 5 mins to go either way
-The Underdome’s final 3 levels… like really. They are 20 rounds each round have 5 waves so 100 waves per map. Which takes up to about 2-3 hours average. Like WHYYY
-Ok I won’t be “that” guy and talk about how unbelievably op Crawmerax is but the thing that matters more so for my final con is the dumb fucking achievements in the Claptrap DLC where you have to pick up these random items for acheives: 3D glasses, pizza, oil cans, etc. they are so rare and you basically have to AFK for like 5 hours on the final boss to actually get anything oh and you have to do this for about 3 times. The pizzas are as rare as a snowball in hell like holy shit why. 
-Why was there a an achievement to spend $8 million for nothing? 
-Underdome gives no XP... all that killing for nothing.

Overall this game is ok although it lacks in having a good map and somewhat really dumb side quests. It's still a really fun game to play with friends and is a sweet shooter on killing bad guys and monsters with friends. Yet again if you’re considering still the other Borderlands are obviously better and I’d honestly skip this one and play the Enhanced version for a better experience."
12690,"I give this a 9/10. Some aspects are not entirely  perfect, but overall it is an excellent game. If you are looking for a more standard FPS experience, look elsewhere(it requires grinding and follows other rpg norms)"
12691,"This game is awesome
"
12692,"I'm pretty late to the Borderlands party but I've had a lot of fun playing it.  If you have at least one friend to play through it with and have some working voice com, it's more fun.  If you've read or watched anything about it you know that Borderlands is a FPS with light RPG elements with the main focus being on finding better loot (weapons, armor and other items).  There is a story but it's mostly secondary to finding more and better loot. I also like the over-the-top humor presented through the dialog and characters you encounter."
12693,"Borderlands 1 is a great game, it's fun, and is a great mixture of FPS, and RPG, It has classes, awesome guns, and everything!"
12694,"Finally gave borderlands a chance to try it and while I wasn't dissapointed it really wasn't anything special to me, the looting and the action is pretty good but the cartoony graphics style just doesn't suit me. It just didn't catch my attention as similar RPGs like Fallout where I spent alot of time."
12695,"great game, still havent beat it yet. rpg/action/shooter/open world"
12696,"Lootin' and shootin' in a dried-up wasteland, what's not to love? I mean that's basically how I could describe New Vegas, and that game is incredible! In all seriousness though, Borderlands has great combat, an interesting world, and some fun characters put through a mediocre story. An all-around fun time, much better with friends."
12697,"I did not have the chance to experience the borderlands franchise, so now I am as I purchased them all in a bundle including all DLC. Borderlands 1 has its ups and downs. This title was obviously developed with consoles in mind, which can be fine, and there have been much worse ports, however it's obvious with the graphical style and controls that end up hurting the PC version more than helping it. Gameplay is superb however, The guns are amazingly interesting and fun to use, never stale. Abilities vary however could use better descriptions and explanations as you just kinda find out as you go. As an RPG/FPS hybrid this does something that no other game has every achieved in such a hybrid. No doubt quirky and fun, great to give a go around however I think the second game has more in store for me. 8/10."
12698,"I have many fond memories of this game, but at this point... just get the sequel I think. Borderlands does have imperfections that were mostly corrected or at least improved for BL2. BL1 good, BL2 better. BL2 -really- good."
12699,"Open world action, Explosions, Bullets, guns, guns & more guns, monsters, giant monsters, Guns, loot, cash, jury-rigged vehircles with guns, & more Shooting!

Need i say anything more?. :)"
12700,Ok
12701,yall mother fuckeres need claptrap
12702,"Ein Spiel das mal etwas Farbe in die Shooterwelt bringt. Es gibt ein unglaubliches Sammelsurium an Waffen, weshalb man immer auf der Suche nach dem besten Equipment ist und Waffen vergleicht. Die Kampagne lohnt es sich sogar 2 mal durchzuspielen, da man mit dem erreichten Level, diese nochmals gegen angepasste Gegnerlevel bewältigen kann.
Die Add-ons versprechen auch eine Menge Spaß, doch rate ich allen auf ein runtergesetztes Gesamtpaket zu warten, da mit diesen nur nochmal richtig Geld gescheffelt werden will (siehe Borderlands 2...)"
12703,Nice and Fun Game with elevated adrenaline.. :)
12704,"This is an awesome game, and, in my opinion, is better than the second one! It has immature humor that I find hillarious. It's combat system is really fun, and has a really unique weapon system that is a little complicated, but is very easy to learn. I fully reccomend this game!"
12705,"Borderlands macht richtig viel Spaß, es gibt sau viele Quests zu erledige, coole Artefakte und Waffen zu finden, richtig kranke und riesige Gegner zu besiegen, die Welten sind auch sehr groß so das man sich schon fast verlaufen kann und das alles 4 Player Coop"
12706,"Good game
"
12707,"RPGs and Shooters made this master piece, mate~"
12708,"One of those games that was probably fun at launch when you could play it with friends, but it's been a couple of years now, nobody else is playing it, and although you can plow through it solo it's not quite the same experience. If you can't convince some friends to play through it with you, give it a miss."
12709,"Not as good as its sequel but still pretty fun. Best played with friends but the gamespy system is total balls.

Actually now that I think about it, its really nowhere near as good as the sequel, BL2 is better in literally every way.

However, that doesn't stop this being pretty fun."
12710,This game is freaking epic!
12711,"So if you like extremely boring shooters which seem like they might have a fun loot system but actually don't, with a story that is entirely irrelevant in the end, this is the game for you! If you want to actually have fun, uh..."
12712,if you like making love to the most butiful girl while eating exquisite food and haveing the finest of smell all around you then this is your game
12713,"I liked this game when I started playing it. But I didn't really get it so I stopped at level 20ish. Now after several playthroughs of BL2, I have come back to this and absolutely LOVE IT! I am now level 34 (I think) and nearing the end of playthrough #1. Love it! Highly recommended!"
12714,Well if you haven't played this game you're obviously a loser so yeah
12715,"Borderlands has givem me a fun story driven adventure.  It has loot mechanics similar to Diablo yet it delivers a FPS style gameplay experience that is not overly frustrating for casual players like myself.

The DLC's also further the story.  Mad Moxxi's Underdome is too frsutrating but I have enjoyed the Zombie Island of Dr Ned and am playing through the General Knoxx campaign.

This is one to definitely grab especially when it goes on sale."
12716,Phat loot!
12717,"This game makes you feel so incredibly bad-ass :D Hours and hours of gameplay. Fun graphics, it's a great FPS!"
12718,"SHOOT & LOOT , BITCH!

Also: I want that Claptrap  '__'"
12719,"SO FUCKIN FUN!!!!!!!!!
CANT WAIT TO GET THE SECOND ONE !!!!!!!"
12720,"Basic. That's how I'd describe it. It doesn't feel developed enough - the AI sucks, the guns don't feel different enough, the story is lacking, and the sidequests are nearly always fetch quests or variants thereof (don't quote me on that, I haven't played it in ages). From what I hear, Borderlands 2 improved EVERYTHING though."
12721,An essential in every Steam collection.
12722,Grande e divertido :d GOOD GAME
12723,"Great gameplay, style and world,.  It's just a shame that the plot leaves you lacking."
12724,"Great mix of FPS and RPG, lot of items, and high replayability. This game is for you if you like FPS and/or RPG."
12725,"Good for a playthrough or two, not a fan of massive quantities of DLC though."
12726,"Great game, the real fun begins during the second play through... and from what I see it is a lot better than the second."
12727,This game is a prefect combination of FPS and RPG. One of the best pieces i have ever played.
12728,"An amazing shoot-and-loot experience, full of humour and clever jokes. It oozes style and uniqueness, too!
Really entertaining, and the DLCs add some variety to the missions."
12729,"Borderlands was a new project by Gearbox Software back in 2009. The game had a lot of unique features and settings. A first-person shooter set on a sci-fi planet - Pandora, with a lot of focus on RPG elements. The game was very well reviewed and recieved a various amount awards, including several Game of the Year's. Visually the game is beautiful and covered in cel shading, giving it a very comic book / hand-drawn look. The game took cel shading so far, that people often associate the game with that specific art-style. Thanks to the cel shading, the game could hide behind pretty simple textures without appearing low-res, as the game does not have to look realistic.

Pandora is a very hostile planet, as you quickly get to experience with the regular human bad-guys and also a selection of aliens and mutations. You get to choose between 4 characters to play, each with it's unique ability and weapons. There is a leveling system where you gain experience and level up specific perks for your character and set-up. When you level up, so does your enemies, and occasionally you encounter a 'Badass' (stronger and more dangerous than the regular), as well as a bunch of unique variants and bosses. 

This game rewards you with more loot than your grannies wrinkles. You will drown in a sea of a billion different weapons, with different ammo types, reload speeds, firing speeds, scope zooms, damage etc. IT NEVER ENDS! There are 4 types of bonus damage; fire, explosion, shock and corrosion, all with an advantage and disadvantage to specific enemies. Luckily, you don't wear or find any armor in the game, only a shield and health augmentation, that has about as many billion combinations as the weapons.

A lot of people compare Borderlands with Fallout 3. They are in reality very different from one another. Borderlands is very humoristic and bright, while still being twisted and deteriorated. This game is not set in a post-apocalyptic world that has been beautiful. Pandora itself never was a peaceful place, and the name should hint it's secrets within. Borderlands never really focus on a good story either, it's just about the loot, man, the LOOT!

This game shows it qualities when played in Co-op, where 4 people can do all this nonsense together. It really starts feeling like an MMO RPG when fighting the harder bosses in co-op, grinding everywhere - and then then rewarded with loot. There even is PVP arenas for fighting over the loot too. If co-op is not an option you can still enjoy it in Single-Player.

[b]Pick this up if you are interested in a unique experience, with friends - or without - with a ton of loot and silly things to shoot.[/b]

[u]Note: Borderlands is the prequel to [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/]Borderlands 2[/url], you might be looking into that game too.[/u]"
12730,"I originally played this game on the Xbox 360 and decided to get it again, with all the DLC, for PC. It is a goofy, hilarious, and straight up awesome game all around. There are tons of weapons and loot explodes out of enemies in a Diablo-esque manner. It has some of the most lovable crazy characters around. Everything about this game is just ridiculous in the best way and I love it for that reason. The PC port could use some work in terms of optimization, but the game itself is one that will forever be among my favorites. 8/10"
12731,"Okay... So this is a game that's been out for awhile. Never got the time to try it, now that i did i can say this is one of the best shooters i played. better yet THE best i played. A level up system, massive loot pool and humorous yet great to play storyline all combined in one game. not to mention the offline and online modes which make this game alot of fun even after finished the plot.

A great shooter with a little disappionting twist in the plot (avoiding spoiler) this game gets a 9/10"
12732,"2Kってすごい、そう思うゲームでした。
ウェブサイトで見られるクラップトラップの動画も面白いよ！"
12733,One game that you should not be let down IT is that good and also try to get the second one
12734,very good game !
12735,Really good loot fest game.  Like an FPS version of Diablo with a space western outlaw feel.
12736,Fun to kill little midgets in the HEAD!!!!
12737,Really fun alone. Even better with friends!
12738,"Затягивает ;) 
P.S играть в команде))"
12739,A Great Sci-Fi Action/RP game. There are small nods to various science fiction material throughout the game.
12740,Piw piw...
12741,yawn
12742,"Nice addicting rpg, the dialogue can be pretty funny, entertaining and stupid at times, especially with the clap-traps. The cartoony graphics is a nice touch and make the game a little more refreshing. The story on the other hand is forgettable and it can become very repetitive, especially driving. In the end, it's a fun game to play, filled with tons of guns and perks to choose from and a nice variety of enemies"
12743,"I love the characters, the gritty artwork, and the game play."
12744,Yes.
12745,"Grab some friends and prepare to shoot and loot your way through this amazing game. ""The more the merrier"" has never applied to anything better than Borderlands."
12746,"heh.. more like.. nehehehehe.... BOREDerlands


get it

because

when you play it

youll be bored

because

yknow

the games like

boring"
12747,"BRILLIANT!.
no seriously, this is one awesomely addicting game."
12748,#tbt
12749,"Wasn't expecting to find this as addicting as I have. Farewell social life, it was nice having you back for a while :P"
12750,"the game's insane , very hard  when playing single player,very fun and must have game , (The game is beast), And play with me!!!"
12751,"Nice game, can take away all your free time just to get new gun & loots. Lots of funny moment & story, kill enemy in funny way, acid, shock, fire, explosian for gib.

You get bored once you have max out your level, gun, loot."
12752,some of the best money I have ever spent on gaming.
12753,"Great game, no doubt, you have for sure many hours to have fun on borderlands universe with a great graphics i personally love... 100% awesome!"
12754,"Pretty good RPG shooter. It is challenging every now and then, has a addictive looting system and most importantly, it has decent shooting mechanics so you feel rewarded for your ability to aim. The downsides would be repetitive quests, too much unnecessary travel, forgettable locations, dififculty to aim at the enemy weakspots due to autoaim, respawning low level enemies that you have to kill many times, and having to go back and forth after every quest in order to be able to follow the questlines and be able to do all quests in the game for achievements.

9/10 so far, at 25 hours in.I think the repetitive traveling can be forgiven to some extent."
12755,So good shoot and loot with 3 other friends its cheap and will keep you entertained and laughing for hours at its funny jokes.
12756,"Propably one of the best Games ive played. Its a role playing shooter.. a bit like Mass effect but less cutscenes and ""Life changing"" decisions.. basicly just grab a gun and kill..no bull."
12757,Super Fun Game Love it 8.5/10
12758,Best Pandora
12759,its okay but it would be more okay if there were more references
12760,the best game!!!
12761,Badass Cartoon Mayhem that lets you MELT PEOPLE FACES OFF. The End
12762,80/100
12763,I <3 MELTING MIDGETS WITH MY ACID GUN.
12764,A really great break in the usually grinding of an MMO RPG but with your friends! Never really gets old with all new enemys and various guns to always keep you striving for more.
12765,"Un jeu qu'il est super fun, surtout en coop !"
12766,I really love this game...
12767,"Best shooter I've ever seen, the number of different guns is insane and you're always looking for the next better one... be prepared to lose a lot of time into this"
12768,Yes! Yes! YES!
12769,i hve been doing a play of this game for a bit and i am having a say about of how good i like it he he he heh
12770,get this it is amazing
12771,awesome
12772,Yeah I still play this game and it's been out for years. It's not the most polished game I've seen but it's got enormous replay value.
12773,"Awesome game when you get used to it, plus if you play this first then borderlands 2 you'll get the best experience!"
12774,"A fun game that was a bold move for Gearbox at the time and really allowed them to do much of what they have done since....it was far from perfect and hugely surpassed by the far superior sequel. However if you fancy something that's fun or you are a huge fan of BL2 and never played the first one then this game is well worth your time, especialyl with the DLC."
12775,loooooot everywhere~~~
12776,Shit med fun
12777,"A wonderful mix of FPS and a Diablo II style action RPG.  Item collection is fun, and there's lots of quests to help you explore the world."
12778,"Probably my favorite game of all time. It takes the fun dungeon crawling with tons of things from diablo and turns it into a first person shooter, with a fun story. You get toooooooooooooooons of guns, fun misions and hilarious dialogue. 10/10."
12779,Uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado .... mejor que dead island.
12780,While Borderlands 2 is the better game by far if you want to expierience the original it is still well worth it.
12781,"Great game! I like the Wasteland enviornment. Borderlands reminds me of Fallout and RAGE. The weapons are amazing, different graphics. And very many side quests you can do, along with leveling up and having class mods."
12782,"A classic. Sand-Box game with excellent aesthetic and Random Gun Generator. Over 3,000,000 unique weapons. Strong voice acting and humor ellents. Fun Shooter overall with good mobility and pacing."
12783,c'est TROP COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12784,"UN chef d'oeuvre, MA-GNI-FI-QUE jeu absolument épique, tellement de contenu. A acheter."
12785,Borderlands Is a Great game! Mostly Because of the Leveling up consept and the guns and the Online Co-op Gameplay. Sadly there is not Team vs Team Match up in Borderlands But like i said before Co-op is a lot of fun. (TIP) - Playing online gets you leveled up faster. The game has (XP) whitch gets you leveled up. I Really do Recommend this Game to all my friend's and many more. If your someone who like gun games like online and likes games that are under $5.00 then this the game for you!
12786,"Very beautiful game,nice graphics,amazing story and quests."
12787,Classic! <3
12788,Don't have borderlands 2. Time to get borderlands 1
12789,Guter Klassiker
12790,Addictive and awesome
12791,"5.86/10 collecting guns is fun, a little humour and good switching from solo to multiplayer, unbalanced areas, runs shit with low graphics on slow pc (other shooters are quicker and prettier), didn't even get to go in the damn vault *raAAAge bitch slap to the writing crew*"
12792,"""Oh there ain't no time for the wicked!""
Freaking love this game. It's so dirty, rough and tumble! It ain't afraid to say ""FUCK YOU! I'LL DO WHAT I WANT"" Playing multiplayer is the best when playing, but it isn't too bad to play alone either. Only slight con is that the quests are sometimes tedious, but the gunfights make up for it in my opinion. The classes are pretty great and the arrayof creatures make it more enjoyable. Also, love the hundreds of guns! Burning bullets and electric sniper rifles all the way <3"
12793,geeeeeeenial para todos los que le guste jugar juegos con buena trama multyplayer o solo o con solo una lista clasificada :D
12794,Best played with 3 other friends. Interesting story and gameplay is fun.
12795,excellent issime !!
12796,good game to play with a few mates and for £5 for goty how can u say no (unless u hate borderlands ^^)
12797,"One of the best of the best in terms of co-op RPG gaming. It's older now, but it's STILL good!"
12798,Thanks Capracus <3
12799,Great Game !
12800,Just awesome!!!
12801,Awesome. That word is enough to describe this game.
12802,"Borderlands is a mess - this sometimes works to its advantage, but most often it is to its detriment.

This is one of the worst cases of the trickle down from consoles to PC with poor control, terrible map sytem, and the most tedious looting I have encountered.

The DLC made the game playable, but sets the bar so low for what DLC could and should be. The Borderlands DLC swindle is a joke.

Borderlands & Gearbox, are overrated - both have so much potential. Try.... Harder.... Please....

The only thing I have learned from this is to wait for the Game of the Year Edition for Borderlands 2 - and then get that on a Steam Holiday Sale.

(that means the game isn't worth full price + DLC purchases)"
12803,One of the best games of this generation but play it alone is no worth it
12804,This was the first game I thoroughly enjoyed in a very long time. Replayability is very high and joining 3 other players makes it so much more interesting!
12805,>implying you shouldn't buy this game
12806,"Nice game...
btw remember to get the goty,that extra $10 with make u even more addicted to this game."
12807,"If u r in to first person shooters, this is a must"
12808,"7/10 : Not bad, pretty good actually. Can be a lot of fun while playing multiplayer with friends. Awesome graphics, characters and storyline. Very confusing with the map when starting out, or was it just me ? :P"
12809,"What is there to say, that hasn't already been said, about the game that started a legend? The game that combined 2 of my favorite types of games, RPGs and FPSs, and did it right? Giving you 4 character types to choose from, each with a unique backstory, individual special skills, tons of ways to alter how they preform through how you spend their skill points and, lest we forget, ""Bazillions of Guns"". 

Being honest, the game has some problems; how the guns get built (the game randomly builds them as you play so no two that you find/buy are ever truly alike, which can make them either overpowered or utterly useless), how the co-op portion works, or the fact that while using controllers is supported you need to manualy alter one of the games files in order for the buttons to show on-screen instead of the mouse/keyboard controls.

But those problems aside, the games playability is nearly off the charts, the DLCs are absolutly great and add tons of extra hours of gameplay, and the cartoonish, cell-shaded visual style of the game sets it apart from every other game that's trying to get as close to photorealistic graphics as they can. And even given that the game is almost 4 years old (as of May 2013) I still find myself going back and playing it again after all this time because it is just that good."
12810,"I love this game. Wonderful world and a bazillion guns make this my GOTY for 2009. Incredibly fun with its unique artstyle just push it over the top. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys action, adventure, and role playing games.
Unlike other games, the DLC for Borderlands is quite enjoyable, and I would also purchase these."
12811,"this game is a boatload of fun and is also good with friends, play as the big guy and punch people and use super strong shotguns, or play as the slightly less big guy and have a turret that heals you or play as the little guy with the sniper rifle and shoot your bird at people or play as the girl spy and breathe fire on people or something, jus thave fun or whatever"
12812,"This is by far one of my favorite games of all time. It has hundreds of thousands of guns, so you never get bored, and the dialogue is hilarious. It's best played with a friend, so get others to play it with you. I highly recommend the GOTY, because you will never run out of things to do.

2016"
12813,Really having a blast playing this game. Addictive as hell too!
12814,wow awesome game if you havnt already played it
12815,Fun
12816,"By far one of the best games I have ever played. I could spend hundreds of hours just playing through the game with all of the characters, not to mention grinding and farming for awesome loot and the DLCs!"
12817,"This is good, but not mind blowing.. Comes from what I would expect from Gearbox.  There is a pleasant feel about the game, but design is flawed in places, the story is few and far between, and unless your grinding and gettin into it, you will not know wtf is going on.

I would consider this a pretty mindless shooter game.   Ellis on L4d was wrong, this is the greatest shooting range of all time, as, esp with the a high level of experience, you are un-stoppable; l4d is less like a shooting range as in a party  of blood mayhem and carnage(a complement).  This However is what peopel 'THINK' about what  Payday: the Heist (which is awesome) was like (but is not) a cardboard cut out shooting game.

If you like shooting at things, this is for you. 

If you like drinking and playing a smooth rewarding, yet not too deep game,without thought, this is for you. I have enjoyed many hours on here plastered when I need to kill a few hours for my body to gain fucntion again.

It is worth noting that later, however when the crimson lance come in, things DO become more intersting. They are better shots, are a lot better co-ordinated and many have impentrable sheilds and armour,  making this a worth while endeavour perhaps at the end, to make you feel like your a good shot :P.  Oh and the bosses are reasonably nasty too , but easy enough if a, you have the will and cash to die over and over and over or b, are not a plank.

It's good enough for me to says it's recommendable,though there are plenty of other better games out there, I personally dont understand all the fuss. Though I will admit, the 'art' abd 'style' of the game is good too."
12818,"Play the campaign with four friends, or play it alone.  Nice long campaign, decent DLC, more weapons than Skyrim and a sociopathic main character.  All the necessary components for a fun pseudo post-apocalyptic game."
12819,"Highly addicting, you think you'll just do the missions and ignore the side quests or even examine every piece of loot. I've been picking up everything and doing all the quests because it's just fun. Finished the main campaign and am now doing the DLC. Only gripes are some bugs with the map not giving you the correct location of your mission objective and getting stuck in some places. I think I paid $10 bucks for it here on Steam with all the DLC and it is worth every penny!"
12820,VLTTP
12821,"Just fantastic, the perfect blend of FPS and RPG, and 100s of hours of gameplay made even more fun by online multiplayer."
12822,"Du du ru! Dut tu tu! Borderlands, Borderlands, Borderlands.
First; You should play...
Second; You will need good weapons man, good weapons!
Third; Otherwise you will definetly die! (:"
12823,Love. This. Game.
12824,"В выпуске ""Game Informer"" сентябрь 2007 впервые появилась информация об этой игре. Выпуск в ""золото"" произошел в октябре 2009 года. Gearbox Software проделали во истину большую работу, Unreal Engine 3.5, открытый мир, action с элементами RPG.. Кооператив на 4-х человек.. Невообразимые количества разнообразного оружия и их модификаций, необычные противники.. Всё это казалось в самом начале натуральным безумием и провалом, НО.. Немного поиграв, можно осознать что это ШЕДЕВР! Безумный шутер на планете Пандора, с её чудоковатыми персонажами, противниками. В наличий также четыре скачиваемых дополнения (DLC), которые и без того большой мир ещё сильнее насыщают новыми приключениями/врагами/лутом/квестами и т.д. Must Have! 
Также в сентябре 12' года господа из Gearbox выпустили достойное продолжения достойной игры =) - Borderlands 2!
Так что.. запасаемся пивом, сигаретами, обмениваемся скайпами с друзьями и идем исследовать этот интересный мир =)"
12825,Really great game that combine rpg element whit a fps combat system. The story is really great.
12826,Great game!!!
12827,Mindblowing and funny game
12828,"its better than number 2
"
12829,"This game is actually more fun than it seems at first. Yes, it's repetitive and focused on co-op, but you can still enjoy playing it solo provided you like FPSs and loot systems.

One of things I like most about this game is that it rewards your exploration. If you're like me and like to try to get to places that seem unreachable, jumping around and checking corners, you might be surprised to find a chest or a simple little reward occasionally. It's something I wasn't expecting that the designers of the game seemed to have predicted, and I'm really happy for that.

Now one of the things I DON'T enjoy in this game is the weird difficulty. The enemies levels don't scale, so for someone like me who likes to complete all the quests in the game and explore it's easy to be overleveled and make the game a cakewalk. In some parts, however, the difficult has odd sparks that seem more arbitrary than natural, and sometimes almost unfair, with some enemies taking huge amounts of health from you.

Despite the repetitiveness nature of the game, it's samey environments and not-so-interesting quests, I still enjoyed this one more than I thought I would. If you like shooting things in the head and allow yourself to get hooked on the loot mechanics, you might enjoy it too!"
12830,"Borderlands, a loot based adventure? More like Hoarderlands 

Borderlands is a loot based RPG-FPS with Co-Op Elements, What makes borderlands so special is the playable classes, unique humor, and the millions of guns that exist. You start on a bus with the choice of 4 different characters. Each one has a unique skill tree that can be manipulated for different play styles. 

You have Roland, An assault class with his special skill being a deployable turret. 

Mordecai, A sniper class who has his pet bloodwing as his skill, deploying it makes it fly and attack enemies over a distance.

Lilith, A Siren who has the special ability to Phasewalk (Become invisible for a period of time, releashing a shock wave when ending).

Brick, A berserker (Tank), Who has the beserk skill that allows him to pound and punch enemies to death easily with increased survivability. 

All four characters are better suited to certain weapons that can be enhanced with their skill tree, Their special abilities can also be upgraded to do more damage and have more unique aspects. The class system makes for wonderful Co-Op.

The plot is unremarkable and cliche, You play as 1 of 4 vault hunters who seek a vault that is said to contain amazing wonders and loot. There is nothing really special about the story at all, But borderlands shines when it comes to colorful characters and unique even humorous quests. The game is open world and has huge spawling levels but for the most part this coupled with hordes of enemys can make travel boring over time, Prepare for a ton of walking. Borderlands also has vehicular combat, the controls are wonky and wierd but manage somehow to get the job done despite working against players. 

There is tons of guns, So many you will get rich off selling them. Borderlands prides itself on its gun system, creating guns using a system that allows for millions of different combinations. Although this sounds awesome you will probably see guns that look similar. Borderlands top tier loot is powerful, unique and legendary weapons haave unique properties and will keep you playing. 

The Graphics and sound hold up, Although some textures could be better but there is really no problems wiith it comes to this catagory. The Art style is unique and fits the humor of the game well and the soundtrack is immersive and fits the different locations.

Overall Borderlands is a unique Loot based FPS-RPG, Despite having a few problems and a lackluster plot, Borderlands makes up in its Humor, Loot, and Unique Characters/Art Style/Skill Tree system. I would recommend Borderlands greatly, especially if you are looking for some of the best co-op on PC."
12831,"second best game ever!
"
12832,5 out of 5 stars - Brilliant co-op game for 4 players. Definitely loved the RPG-feel to it. The random loot tables make searching for goodies worthwhile. Really long game that has lots of replayability.
12833,"This game is a fun,adventurous and challenging game with lot's of cool weapon's and awsome creature's to fight(might i add the awsome characters)."
12834,"Gdyby ktoś kazał mi otworzyć puszękę Pandory, obiecując jednocześnie, że w środku znajdę kumputer z zainstalowanym Borderlands™- nie zawahałbym się.
Tytuł przypadł mi do gustu tym bardziej, że tak w Diablo II™, jak i Fallouty zagrywałem się jak szalony wiele lat po ich premierze- a Borderlands™ wylądował dokładnie pośrodku tych produkcji, pakując się do tego w naprawdę solidnie wykonane buty shootera. To wystarczy by zapomnieć o świecie. Przykład? Jednego wieczora zaczołem zabawę o 20:00, i po chwili poczułem się zmęczony- tyle tylko że gdy spojrzałem na zegarek, była już 2:30... ~BRIDE~

12835,"I played it through on PS3 a few years ago and thought it was ok except for that lameass ending and how you find the same shitty drops a million times despite ""a million guns"" being possible
since then I've realized it's a fairly mediocre shooter with simplistic RPG mechanics
5.8/10 lazy port"
12836,Yes.
12837,LOOT FEST
12838,in my top 10 fav. list of games
12839,"The first Borderlands in my opinion is the better one, the world seems bigger, the story seems longer, the characters are more varied and the different areas of the world all seem to have more character. It's has slightely less funny moments than Borderlands 2 but that is not to say this game is not hilarious. One of the best RPS of all time."
12840,"Probably the most underrated Borderlands there is. Given that 2 is obviously fantastic, this one started it all. In a way I feel like the original Pandora and its story created a more personal connection to the game."
12841,Ultimately just the best FPS ever created.
12842,"Lilith is a bitch.

But I love her!"
12843,I like dis game BRO! BROFISTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!
12844,First person shooter with rpg elements in comic book style. All done with tongue firmly in cheek! Good fun.

12846,"A forgiving but fast-paced introduction to the series; pace of play, character histories and game mechanics are eased into. The last of which is most important if second game is on the to-do list."
12847,"before you get borderlands 2, you should play this game through before, its worth it in my opinion + you get the background story knowledge"
12848,Absolutely Great!
12849,Still better than COD
12850,"it is a perfect FPS game wich applies a diferent type of perspective of graphycs and missions. i have only just started the game though so why dont you try it for your self.
Derp :P"
12851,um dos melhores games cooperativo que já joguei!!
12852,"I have mixed feelings on Borderlands.  In terms of action and cooperative gameplay, Borderlands is addictively fun.  However if you're looking for something with a strong story and characters, I'm afraid Borderlands is rather weak.  Following what is happening in the plot of the game is confusing and, to be blunt, nearly impossible to care about.  I played this game solo and almost had to invent my own reasons for doing anything to stay interested in game.  Most of the time I felt like aquiring new loot and leveling were the only ambitions I had.  Again, the game was developed with the aforementioned co-op action in mind, and on that level, it's very effective in a joyfully mindless way.  I'm also sorry to say, Borderlands has probably the most disappointing ending in video game history."
12853,This is one I <3 :D
12854,"If Unreal Tournament and Diablo2 would have a child it would be borderlands.
If you like those 2 games you will like borderlands."
12855,"Very fun, very funny, great with friends."
12856,"Crazy, super fun. The ultimate RPG/FPS hybrid. If you're experienced with one and not the other (as I was), it's a fantastic way to transition to another great genre of games. 
Even when the game is difficult, it's still a lot of fun. That should really speak to it's overall quality."
12857,BUY IT NOW MY FREINDS!
12858,Woo weird things and a fuck load of guns
12859,"Borderlands, the game that came before Borderlands 2.  What can I say about it?  I guess its a lot like Borderlands 2 with less robust story.  

This game introduced us to Claptrap, a funny little robot with an altitude!  I hope we see more of him in Borderlands 3."
12860,Why did I wait so long?!
12861,"A good combination of RPG and FPS, offers long time experience, many weapons,  4 classes to choose from: soldier, hunter, siren and berserker, each with own preferred weapons/skills. Many DLC:s available, and multiplayer also."
12862,"ERMERHGERD

SO MANY WEAPONS

SO MUCH MADNESS

CAPS LOCK"
12863,"If you liked Dead Island, you'll like Borderlands and vice verca.  Mechanics wise, they are very similar. I think Borderlands is more forgiving in difficulty, and it also does not have weapon degredation like DI. .  Defintely worth buying!"
12864,Better than Skyrim
12865,5/5. Loved playing through this. Elemental weapons are awesome.
12866,There ain't no rest for the wicked. But you probably won't want to rest while playing this game. :D
12867,"Full of Gore and action, 8/10. if you like gore and action this is your game."
12868,"A different FPS with lots of hours in a very funny and huge world, tons of different weapons and quite different ways to play it, but the must fun is the multiplayer, all in all, this is a ""must have"""
12869,FPS Skyrim
12870,Shizzle on my nizzle
12871,Absolutely inmersive. It's better to play with friends. A little bit glitchy but still great.
12872,"borderlands is a fun game to play white friends and have many monsters to kil 
and many guns to shoot buy it and play it ..... .. you tink you hade a friend but i was rong"
12873,"Афигенство, простата, доминирование, свобода. HELL YEAH"
12874,喜欢游戏画面和剧情
12875,"more like BOREDerlands hahahahahaa no seriously this game is pretty boring, i only played a bunch of it cuz i played it while listening to podcasts and stuff so if you need a game for that, then skyrim's a lot better than this is for that. or trackmania actually. yeah just buy trackmania united instead.

The shooting's alright though,and numbers fly out of dudes when you hit them. There's like some weird conditional response behavioral psychology thing that makes people love that that this definitely taps in to. Maybe that's enough to get you through all the repetitive quests and bland environments and bad dialogue.

Also I think the font they use for everything is great and I'm really mad about them changing it in Borderlands 2. This game is alright for the price but man FUUUUUUCk Borderlands 2."
12876,I do not recommend this game. This game felt like playing with Duplos instead of Legos.
12877,"Cell-shading - it's good =)
Guns... very good =)
And! FUN! =) 
Conclusion: everything is fine!"
12878,Awesome game for solo play and with friends. Story is great as is the actual game play. A must have.
12879,blow your brains out fun
12880,"This game is unique!  A fiarly well done mesh of the RPG and FPS genres.  More action and a little less RPG than Fallout 3.  It has its issues (can feel slow and aimless at times, repetetive) but it is worth it.  It gets a Rare in the MapleGaming system."
12881,Unreal tournament 3 in a cartoon twist meets Fallout 3 i give it  9.1 Buy it NOW!!!! XD
12882,fucking garbage
12883,Best FPS/RPG
12884,Great game plays a lot like dead Island. If you like first person shooters this is definitely worth the time and now at a low price.
12885,Guns guns guns.
12886,SHOW!!!!!!!!
12887,"This game is great if you like to loot and to try to have a game that is a chalnge to beat in one sitting. This game is larg and expansive, and full of weirdos that want you dead. They say its an RPG shooter, but it does not feel like one the leveling up is feels almost pointless. This game is more of a an almost free roaming shooter. 7/10"
12888,Shoot and Loot and get sweet guns and armor.
12889,WULR﻿ HUWURR UWAARRRLARLRRLWAAA!
12890,I bought the GotY edition and never used the DLC. That's how good this game is.
12891,"Juego que en un principio promete mucho, pero que luego se vuelve monótono y aburrido, includso jugando en compañía. No quiero ni pensar lo que puede ser jugarlo solo...."
12892,"This game rocks.  You can do things as you become able, not when forced to."
12893,RATING: 80/100
12894,"The one and only original multiplayer coop post-apocaliptic slaughterfest. Huge with the DLCs, it provides a massive playground to go up to level 69 ;). So far I would recommend playing as the Siren, she's well balanced and her speed stealth phase ability lets you run through the levels in no time. There are some awesome bosses and settings, and facing a wide variety of hordes of enemies can be a good challenge (specially from the Crimson Lance) . The soundtrack provides a good blood pumping tempo for the endless waves of opposition and the plot can be quite cruel and overall less cartoony than the sequel. Nice and gritty, the game provides endless hours of fun even specially now that the multiplayer is back up thanks to steam!"
12895,Incredibly fun (WITH FRIENDS)
12896,"Play borderland, i miss bioshock.
i love bioshock, but borderland it's normal fun."
12897,"Приятный кооператив, разнообразные миссии советую всем  !!!"
12898,I love this game. It never ends.
12899,One of the best games I've ever played...
12900,"Great fun in post apocalyptic mad max kind off world named Pandora. Big world with 4 different classes and pure action first person RPG are explosive combination. Add 4 DLCs and you have many hours of fun. Oh and did I mention co-op multiplayer ? 

80/100"
12901,"Borderlands is a great game with tons and tons of missions. The original story wasn't that great in my opinion but, the dlc made up for that. There are numerous enemies to slay and to many weapons for any 1 person to have. (which is a good thing) I would recommend this game to any fps/rpg lover out there and I'm looking forward to playing the 2nd Borderlands."
12902,Besser als Teil 2
12903,"VAULT HUNTER WANTED !!!

The new legend  was born , from the small company called GEARBOX software who once started their own journey in the Video game universe by created an expansion pack for Half - life 1 , by the time passed by they have created some of their own franchaise such as the mightly 'Brother in arms series' which is a hugh success at the time and now is their next move. A Sci- fi /  fantasy game called Borderlands 1 

Pros :

4 Classes , Skill trees , Cool Cartoonish graphic , Black jokes / adult humor , Open - world , Unique Setting + places , Tons of quests , Millions of guns (I really mean that )  , farming ? lol ,  Many bosses to kill.

Cons :

Lack of dialogues (The character u play will rarely talk  except laughing after u killed some enemies) , Far traveling which might make you bored , some quests are too repetitive + no improvision.

Verdict :

8.6 / 10

PS. if you happen to own and played this game but not Borderlands 2 yet , just fucking get it already.


 To sum up  , BORDERLANDS 1 = GOOD BUT BORDERLANDS 2 = GREAT"
12904,"The fact is, two months ago I hardly knew what this game was. But now, this is one of my favorite games. It's so fun and full of blood, bulleds, psychos and of cource Claptraps!
 You won't regret it!"
12905,The only first person shooter series I have enjoyed playing. I'm a fan of the RPG elements and fully-integrated multiplayer.
12906,
12907,"this game made me feel funny in my pants, its that good"
12908,"The reason many people dont play this game is because of the art style. Honestly I think thats idiotic, games should be judged mostly on story and gameplay. But thats just me. Definitely a top nitch single player game, and if you can find some friends to play with its even more fun, better if you are ~same level though. Defenitely worth the money, with mass amount of replayability."
12909,"Guns, guns, GUNS!"
12910,Has a pretty interesting story and is best played with friends. Playing blinded is the best for this game.
12911,"I reccomend this game to anybody. It is an amazing first person shooter/ RPG type game. If you love getting new weapons, over 1 million of them, leveling up, getting new skills, and killing fools, than this is the game for you.It does have a few problems on PC, but not major ones. Overall, on PC, I give this game a 9/10"
12912,一款不同於一般FPS風格的遊戲
12913,"First add some diablo like loot, mix in some sillyness,throw in tons of weapons, add 4 characters to play as and you got yourself an addicting RPG shooter.
10/10"
12914,"Warning!! DO NOT GET THIS GAME FOR PC!

It has a lot of problems running, with practically NO benefits whatsoever from running it on PC.

I stopped playing because it was pretty badly optimized. Play Diablo 3 or Torchlight instead."
12915,"nice game, mkay?"
12916,"Просто шутер, без вменяемого, с большой натяжкой сюжета и отсутствием антогониста, с мультяшной, но красивой графикой. Большое количество оружия и врагов, езда на машинах. Желательно проходить в кооперативе, иначе часов через 15, начинает надоедать."
12917,"Seriously if you played Borderlands 2 and never had the chance to grind ,shoot and loot throught the first pick it up!! or wait until its on sale and get the GOTY Edition like i did. you wont regret it"
12918,"Decent game,
Extremly disappointed in the PC port...
Still worth a play though."
12919,"One of the best games ever.....!!! Lots of fun , perfect cooperation and beautiful enviroment...Also the story and the character quotes are kickin it....!! Worth the price..This is how RPG should be.. I can't wait to pick Borderlands 2...."
12920,"Un muy buen juego, al mejor estilo fallout 3, vale mucho la pena"
12921,3 BALLS.
12922,"Took me forever to buy this game but extremely happy with the purchase. Borderlands GOTY has great charcters, witty humor, outstanding moments, extremely addictive play, and the most flacid ending I have seen in a long time. Don't let the lackluster ending dissuade you from playing as the journey is worth every step even in the destination isnt. The great part is even after you are done is that you can go back and keep playing or go through a second more challenging playthrough with high lvl npcs."
12923,"Phenomenal. Absolutely fantastic.

I admit, I missed the boat on Borderlands. By years. I only bought it February 2013.

But the Game of the Year Edition has it all, and was on sale, either $5 or $7.50, so I said why not?

Sandbox gameplay, few glitches, unique freedoms, and (equally entertaining) unique restrictions. Wasn't sold on the art-style, but it truly does help this game stand out. Love the approach on an FPS set ""in the future"" (though it's never said where or when this takes place).

Engrossing. Violent. Funny. Creative. Unendingly entertaining. Get it. Even NOT on sale, the GOTY Edition is an absolute STEAL.

I'd have paid double had I'd known what was in store for me, even though the game is a good few years old."
12924,GOTY edition a friend gifted it to me thx again Xiddom oh and the game is awesome + you get 4 dlcs :D:D:D buy it now!!!
12925,Ez jó!!!
12926,"Borderlands easily deserved its Game of the Year nomination (and win on the Xbox) as an FPS with some RPG mechanics.  There are only a few failings to find in the hours of bloody entertainment you'll get from this very well-made game.

Borderlands is, first and foremost, a first-person-shooter, which gives potential players an idea of what to expect from encounters.  Shoot bad guys, run away from bigger badder guys, come back with better weapons, shoot the bigger badder guys, rinse and repeat.  

Once we include the elements of an RPG like looting the bodies of your victims to find better weapons, shields, and modifiers, the game slows down considerably as you do a lot of looking at numbers to see if any of the five guns that just dropped are better than the one in your hands.  Thankfully vendors where you can sell junk loot for cash are common.

Another RPG signature is an epic plot.  And Borderlands does have a decent storyline... but it falls flat on the delivery, using simple text-boxes and very short audio files to advance the story.  While this certainly appeals to the ""I just wanna blow shit up"" crowd, anybody looking to be entertained by the story will find themselves disappointed that what is actually a fine yarn of a space-western was so neglected to be brought to its true potential.  (In fairness, the DLC does a MUCH better job at entertaining you in their respective stories, although the stories are delivered in the same fashion.)  On the flip side, the bad parts about RPG-style quests are also present, namely that Borderlands is essentially nothing but a series of fetch quests.  At least a fast-travel system exists to get you right back to your turn-in point whenever you're done, but that doesn't turn on until about halfway through the game.

However, you're hardly worried about how a tale is present when you have a guy wielding an axe chasing you looking to turn you into his ""meat poppet"" while another hulking specimen is shooting electric rockets at you and you're still on the cooldown of your action skill and there's an entire private military company deciding to hunt you personally down while honestly all you're trying to do is get an old guy some beer, and did I mention the axe-murderer is on fire?

Borderlands is grand fun, chock-full of intense action sequences, memorably hilarious (if one-dimensional) characters, and just plain fun.  Get a friend to play it with you and go shoot some lightning."
12927,Dude. Dude. Play this game.
12928,"At the time of this game's inception, I was overjoyed to play this since it was something different from what was being mass produced at the time( Call Of Duty). It was very fun down to just about everything. I thought the story was unique and indulging as well as the characters being special in their own way. I thought the open-world kind of game type was well-developed and connected a very plausible world. The world of Pandora has just about any kind of creature one could think of and I think that applies to the variety of guns. Also, the character classes are their own thing and allow for the player to play how they wish since the skill trees branch in ways to allow unique builds. Although, the classes may not be balanced in which one may be more useful than another but still fun to play if you have others to play with. I think the graphics are nice and usually without texture glitches but nothing game breaking. I did notice after playing Borderlands 2 that Borderlands is a little bland and not very vivid in color but I am making this review to be directed before the second installment. Although, I do recommend playing Borderlands 2 but to enjoy the entire series and know the story more personally, I recommend playing this game first."
12929,"Good looongg story, awesome graphics, Super cool expansions, Lot's of time will be invested in this AMAZING fps rpg game, BUY BUY BUY! 10/10"
12930,ThIS gAME IS BLESSED!!!!!
12931,"Good game, bad console port to PC"
12932,Borderlands successfully reboots co-op play and mixes it with an interesting story and unique cel-shaded graphics. The game is set up through various quests and quest hubs that players complete. It supports a party of 4 players and comes with an interesting weapon randomization mechanic. Weapon stats and weapon bullet types are randomized. You may get a shotgun with exploding bullets or a sniper rifle which electrocutes your foes. Highly addictive game - and meant to be played alongside friends!
12933,Just a fantastic game. Nuff said.
12934,"Pretty lulzy, lots of entertainment, Very easy to sit down for like 8 hours and do nothing but play it."
12935,"What do you get when you mix Diablo and Call of Duty, the setting of Mad Max, the art style of Code Hunters, and the writing of a four year old?

This game right here.

Shallow gameplay, bad dialog, weak map design, and horrible game mechanics combine to make a mediocre title that gets by on 12 year olds and buyers who feel they must defend their poor purchases from critics.

The title is as bland in its play through as its characters are unappealing, others feel the multiplayer redeems it, I disagree.  Enemy AI is horrible, and instead of ramping up the effectiveness of said AI, the developers just give the enemies progressively bigger HP and DMG modifiers...  It'd be funny if it weren't so sad.

Between all its faults, one can see some ideas that other, better developers may one day use to improve the shooter genre.  But Gearbox couldn't successfully develop a herpes infection if they wanted it."
12936,A fun game if you mean by blowing a midget's Head in. Get it or i'll blow yours in.
12937,"9/10
Incredible RPG. Only bettered by Borderlands 2

The graphics are great, the weapon randomisation is flat out fun.

The gameplay is great, sounds great and is definately another FPS/RPG that if you dont have in your library it needs to be."
12938,"Still a great game today... one of the best loot-filled almost mindless, yet hilarious shooters ever made... or is that only? Oh, no wait... Borderlands 2 is out, but I have not played it yet, so yeah."
12939,"Dynamic, challenging and awfully funny. This coop-multiplayer-mainly game is great to play with friends! The mechanics are great, the game world is big and the main quest is good, too. Plus, DLCs are worth the money."
12940,"you like role-playing elements? Good. You like shooters? Great. How bout' combining them into one sick, bombass game? FANTASTIC."
12941,"A well crafted world filled with great characters and humour, and satisfying combat and loot at its core. The Claptrap DLC is woeful and some of the achievements are a bit grindy but the rest is great fun."
12942,"si, yo lo recomiendo"
12943,I really recommend that you get this game!!! You wont regret!!!
12944,"The under-appreciated older brother of Borderlands 2. The game is less polished than 2, but still gives the fun loot-'n-shoot experience. The game is well optimized, and the guns are innumerable. The quests are varied, and once you finish the storyline, you have the option to play the story over again at your current level and continue your leveling and face harder enemies with weapons and quests scaled to your level, allowing tons of gameplay hours. The DLC expands the game even further, raising the level cap and adding interesting new quests, enemies, and equipment. It's also where Gearbox started their wonky sense of humor, with more personality and oddities in the characters than the base game. If you liked Borderlands 2, then you should have fun playing through the original."
12945,"Gamespy is dead, intro videos are skipable with a launch command, and much prettier on pc than console. Almost no reason to buy it anywhere else now."
12946,"One of my All-time favourite FPS/RPGs. All round fun, great voice-over work, Lighthearted yet gritty story. Best played with friends.
*Bad PC port. Reffer to PCGamingWiki page before playing. http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Borderlands"

12948,"If you played Borderlands 2 first before this, you wouldn't appreciate it. I suggest finnishing this first before going to Borderlands 2, you'll appreciate the improvements a lot more."
12949,"I'm enjoying Borderlands a lot. It's an FPS, but its story and progression is very much in the vein of Diablo; you go on quests, explore lost areas and find weapons. Yes, there are a huge variety of randomly-generated weapons, and you will constantly be swapping out for new ones. But this is even more interesting than Diablo, because firing a sniper rifle is an entirely different experience from firing a machine gun. So that's fun. Also, Borderlands has a great aesthetic; it's really bizarre, yet cinematic. It opens with a hilarious scene introducing the characters, and the setting is like Mad Max by way of Tarantino on a freaky alien planet. Recommended!"
12950,Always someting to do in Borderlands. Action never stops. Story is pretty neat.
12951,"shootn' & lootn', best thing since sliced bread"

12953,"Borderlands is an amazing game. It has many, MANY guns, and endles gameplay. Not to mention all the great DLC. I highly recommend you play the sequel, Borderlands 2, which has even MORE content."
12954,"9.5/10 this game is great. i mean its got guns, and some other stuff."

12956,"better than borderlands 2 !!!!!
"
12957,"I like the steampunk style of this FPS. Graphics look awesome on the LED HD monitor, and you can't beat the wackiness of the characters."
12958,"This is not actually 2007 mexican horror film Borderland: The Videogame, but an original sci-fi game by Gearbox software.  If you’re like me and not a loser, you probably know who they are because you played the dreamcast port of the original Halflife.  It’s one of those fancy FPS RPG hybrid games where you kill things that drop loot and then level up and spend your cool points on expanding your talent trees, much like World of Warcraft.  Aside from your character's talents, you'll also be picking up tons of loot and weapons along the way, each with their own unique stats that will give your videogame character some spiffy buffs, much like World of Warcraft.  

One of the most neato things about the game is all the fucking guns, I mean there’s guns everywhere.  They’re just sitting on the ground and you can pick them up and take them with you.  When you’re killing shit little numbers pop off of your enemy's heads like you’re playing World of Warcraft again, and one of the classes even has a stealth cloak much like the rogue class from World of Warcraft.  In fact this game is pretty much a ripoff of World of Warcraft with guns.  So if you love World of Warcraft you might want to check this game out."
12959,"Amazingly fun game, its a Diablo styled, sci-fi, fps loot hunt game. Best in its class.



9/10!"
12960,"Perfeito!!! Com amigos, fica melhor ainda =D"
12961,"Borderlands is a co-op shooter with rpg elements that sets you in the far future on a planet that is ridden with bandits and monsters were your goal is to find a hidden alien vault with full of treasure.

The game starts off very slow and begins to be even slower later on despite the beginning sequence really pumping you up for more that doesnt really come in that way. Most of the time the gameplay is that you get quests and run from point A to point B and either destroy , activate or collect a thing. The only difference is sometimes the setup and humor like that you have to shoot shit that stuck on fans that powers something. There arent really any choices to make or any variety except the bossfights who end up to be bullet sponges that you dont really need any tactic for. You dont really mind this because weapons usually feel very good to shoot and there are lots of diffferent types of enemies that have different types of weaknesses, atleast if you get a good weapon drop that actually justifies the bonus against a type of weakness over the dps the other gun you currently have is.

The balancing of the game is terrible aswell. Most of the weapons you find are shit, some weapon types are obviously totally inferior to others and enemies end up later to be bullet sponges that you sometimes can only beat by abusing the bad ai or find better weapons. The game also gives you a couple of characters you can play with different abillies but Brick is obviously the best choice because his ultimate gives him tons of damage per second and makes him almost unkillable because of his fast health regeneration. 

The artstyle is okay, its nothing really impressive but doesnt look bad whatsoever. Only thing i disliked was the fact that the whole time it was just mostly either yellow desert sand or grey and black indoor settings.

The game also suffers from a lot of bugs, not only sometimes questlines can be broken or you can end up stuck, the GOTY version sometimes doesnt recognize that you own all the dlc´s. Also the driving physics are terrible.

The dlc´s are almost all of them bad or okay at best, but i just list them up for convenience and dont add this in the final scoring.
-Zombie Island:
Pretty idiotic unbalanced, would be fun but there arent many quests and the map is very liniar. You can beat it at directly at the beginning of the game when you unlocked the transport system. Only difficulty was the fact that there were so many zombies but rarely any ammo drops. Okay tough if you start it at the beginning of the game and the artstyle is nice. Finally something different than desert.
-Underdome Riot:
Terrible and everyone knows it because it just adds some wave like game where the only reward is just a skill point or two. There arent any loot boxes to get and the difficulty is so high that the reward isnt worth it when you are able to beat it. Up to this day i didnt even bother finishing more than one level.
-Claptraps Revolution:
Basically the high level version of the Zombie Island with claptraps instead of zombies . Except it doesnt share the awesome artstyle. Isnt that unbalanced tough and humor is great, still not really good but not bad either.
-Armory of Knoxx:
Terrible map design would be okay or good dlc but the game sends you driving from one part of the map to the other just to buy time. The whole map is just a huge highway with enemies that annoy you and destroy your car. The end loot is good tough but that was the only reason i played it.

The story itself starts kinda strange because some random woman talks to you despite you being just some random dude that just got out of a bus without a backstory. And of course in the end it doesnt really explain anything you find the vault and really nothing that exciting happens the last bossfight is as bullet sponge like and without any kind of interestening feature except you rarely get ammo drops. 

I played trough the game with my buddy and we both felt bored at the end of the game because the music and the type of constant running without anything really to happen until you stack your quests and take your rewards feels like a chore rather than fun.

I disliked the game because of the unbalanced and boring gameplay that occur after a couple of ours of playing. I dont really get the hype the game got despite everything it does is average at best.

5/10 Average"
12962,Reminicent of any other shooter ever. It's aweful.
12963,"A futuristic dystopian space western, with lots of gun porn, action and occasional comedy. Great with friends.

What more needs be said?"
12964,10/10 - Perfect combination of FPS game and RPG elements with unusual graphic design and shitload of weapons.
12965,"Really cool game but since i got the delux pack with all the dlc (No free copies) It took up a lot of memory
"
12966,Glorious comic-book mayhem.
12967,"what started it all borderlands, in search for the hidden vault named pandora, many and countless adventures and merceneries have given thier lives in search for pandora, your given 4 options to chose between a hunter, soilder, berserker and syren. if you enjoy games such as COD, MOH, or pratically first person shooters im sure youll enjoy this game with more than 50,000 diferent types of weapons im sure youll be debating wether which gun is much suited to your needs.
"
12968,"I've found a new appreciation for this game now that I own all the DLC. Yeah, the main campaign is still butt cheeks but the DLCs other than Moxxi are actually worth the money which is REALLY RARE for DLCs and post-release crap. Be sure to not play Roland or Brick because other than explicit builds they're awful compared to Mordecai and Lilith."
12969,"Loving this game and its DLC. GOTY for sure if you havent already. Great amount of humor, very few complaints. The inability to trade or sell ammo annoys me, thats about it. Oh and driving sucks overall. Other than that, near perfect."

12971,"Short main storyline but still fun to play, played the entire game in co-op."

12977,"I have racked up 100's of hours on the previous console generation, the PS3, and can confirm the gameplay aspects are incredible and addicting, given its simplicity. 

Simply put, the ""Find Quest, Kill Baddies, Receive Loot"" is a loop that is instinctively addicting. It adequately offers the difficulty scalability to coincide with the gameplay loop, without dimishing the overall experience. 

Too weak? Level up; Too easy? Time to put those guns to the test; Too lonely? Get a CO-OP match going."

12993,"Borderlands is an addicting mix of FPS and RPG with very motivating gameplay. It features a large cast of loveable and funny characters, tons of loot and a relatively solid story, despite the terribly sudden and disappointing ending. However, everything up to that point is a joy to play. The game has been designed with co-op in mind and many people claim it's the only way to play it. I think that is nonsense. Playing with other people is almost always fun and yes, many quests in Borderlands are MORE fun cooperatively, but even if you play alone, the game is highly enjoyable, so I would definitely recommend picking this title up, regardless of having anyone to share the experience with or not."
12994,"Beware, playing can be a hazard to your free time. Addictive in all the right ways.

EDIT:
This company has major problems. Randy Pitchford blocked me on twitter for questioning if 2k made the decision to make borderlands 3 epic exclusive, why doesn't HE have outrage for the fans who picked up the remasters?

This company is trash, and doesn't care about it's fans. I do not wish to support this company any longer. Supporting the product is supporting this company and him. I choose to support neither.

FYI, i payed good money for this. I'm entitled to a review of the PRODUCT, that goes beyond simply what is in the software, and to it's business practices and actions and how they have impacted me. Thus i believe this is legitimate criticism."

13019,"This mixture of the RPG and FPS genres is a prime example of quantity over quality.

Every aspect of its design reiterates this philosophy; the art is unique but unimaginative, the music is present but prosaic, the gameplay is traditional but tedious. Without a solid mythos or compelling narrative, Borderlands lacks incentive to continue once its gameplay has worn thin; it demonstrates the width of these genres with none of their depth.

Not Recommended. 5/10."

Overall I rate this game 8 out of 10."

13027,"While the story, charecters (bar a few), and vehicle driving may not be flawless, this game more than makes up for it with guns, guns, guns, and more guns. Oh and 4-player coop is a big plus. The game is a loot based FPS with RPG elements (not very extensive, but it works well with this type of game). the game never seems to get old and due to the aforementioned slighty lacking story has a lot of replayability (I've finished with one character, almost done with another, and working on a 3rd and a 4th). At the price (20$) and with it going on sale a lot, this game is well worth your money."
13028,"What can I say about Borderlands? I have played this game since release and am still playing it now. This is the first game that I have bought every DLC ever released and honestly believe that I had a bargain. They are not the equivalent of COD map packs or zombie modes, (even though when they came out they were a whole £1 cheaper than the COD equivalents!) what you get for the now tiny sum is an extension of a great game one which is a quarter of the playing time of the full game itself.

 The original game? Every playthrough has resulted in something new besides the witty script writing which never seems to get old there are a HUGE selection of weaponry, class mods, shields, grenade mods character selection & customisation's. Ever expanding (yet not quite open worlds) ever increasing difficulty and a rewarding co-op experience. Yet another game I enjoy for the fact you make it your own and play it your way."

13036,"Choose one of four styles of gunnery characters and hunt for a vault. Machine gun, sniper/pistol, SMG, or explosive/melee. RPG element in the game was done well, story is kind of pieced together  and can be easily missed. Travel is a headache for most of the game.The multi cash/ammo grab is buggy and the button needs to be re-pressed. The gun in the beginning start off horrible, but as with all RPGs, get better drastically."
13037,"One of those games that's infinitely better when played with friends. The core of the game plays like an FPS, but with levels, stats, skills, loot and more, it's more like the baby of an FPS and an RPG."

13040,Uh you know why we like it. :P
13041,Insanely awesome game.. Implementation of Shoot and Loot System at its very best. Even better if you play on Co-Op.
13042,This game is awesome i wish i bothered to play it when it came out
13043,"Great game, had loads of fun coop'ing it some years ago. and much more fun than BL2."
13044,"Although most of you have probably already heard of Borderlands, I thought a recommendation was in order nonetheless. A fine mixture of RPG and FPS with a ""hint"" of humor. Enjoyable both on and offline although in my opinion, best played with friends.. as Lionel would say: all night looo~ooong."
13045,"RPG meets FPS and looting,great engine and best played as a party."
13046,A must play
13047,"Fun, cool and awesome with your friends."
13048,Best FPS Diablo ever.
13049,"""Ganhei"" horas e horas a jogar este jogo. Se há jogos que gostamos por causa da história, ese é certamente daqueles que jogamos porque é divertido jogá-lo. As horas transformaram-se emdiversão, especialmente em co-op. Experimentem ;)"
13050,Pc is great! Got it cheep aswell :)
13051,it is by far my favorite game
13052,"Borderlands is a great blend of RPG and FPS that is all about getting loot in the form of guns, grenades and shields. The original is light on any real story, but is a lot of fun to play through with friends. DLC for the game adds some fun past the ending, and most of the DLC adds some story elements more than the original campaign offers. If you can catch it on sale, and have some friends to tag along for the ride, it is a very fun experience."
13053,"Why haven't I done this already? I don't know actually. Frankly speaking, it isn't an extraordinary game but it's so unbelieveably captivating. Well, action is good and atmosphere is either. But I rarely is hooked if it's just that. So I recomend it cause I don't even know why am I so fond of it."
13054,played for 5 mins buy this game
13055,"At first I thought this game was pretty bad, I started it with a few friends but in honesty we were useless at it, we didn’t get very far and were playing it in completely the wrong order. I wrote the game off as bad and I was convinced I would never finish it.  I restarted with someone else and I was actually very surprised what an impact the people you play with can make. This time it was played properly (no offence, guys) and the game grew on me very quickly.
Admittedly it’s slow when it comes to storyline, it took a little while for me to feel like there was actually a purpose to the game and I wasn’t just doing the same stuff over and over. When I look at it that way, you pretty much are doing the same thing over and over, but as the storyline unfolds I didn’t even really notice that anymore. There is a lot in this game to keep you distracted, one key part of that being the weapon system. It’s the first game I had played where “loot” was a big thing and it being a first person shooter only made that even better. There’s a massive range of weapons with different stats and abilities for you to find, in all kinds of shapes, sizes and rarities.
That being said, I would never play this game solo. The co-op in this game is what makes it for me. That is very likely to be different for a lot of other people, so most people should just ignore that part, for me it just wasn’t something I would do on my own. I know for a fact I would get bored long before the end if I was on my own. So if you are like me, make sure you bring someone along you enjoy spending your time with.
It’s a fairly lengthy game, and there’s a number of classes you can complete it with. The characters all have certain charms about them, they are all completely different from each other and with the whole RPG like elements in this game it’s a good reason to come back and play again. Which is always good, replay-ability in a game is never a problem.
As well as this being the first first-person shooter RPG-like looting game I had ever played, this was also the first game I had ever played that used cell-shading in the graphics, and I have to say that I loved it. I think it’s a great style. I would say that I hoped more games used it, but I’m pretty sure that after this franchise released it rubbed off on a number of other game makers as well.

All in all, I ended up really enjoying this game.
(Not as much as I did Borderlands 2, but that’s another review all together)
I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a great game to play with friends."
13056,"Guns, Friends, Loot. The RPG and FPS fusion with a touch of dark humor that's just awesomely fun. With loads of DLC, an amazing art style, as well as a crazy fun game play mechanic with friends, it's a great buy with friends."
13057,Frantic Dismemberment Mayhem.
13058,Fun Diablo-style shooter. Satisfying shooter mechanics and well-done RPG elements. Biggest downside is that you spend as much time sifting through the  bazillion guns that you loot checking for a +1 in the right stat as you do actually shooting people. That shit bothers me.
13059,Addictive gameplay that won't let you quit.
13060,borders
13061,Awesome game. Real fun.
13062,"Borderlands is an anything-but-generic 1st person shooter. With RPG elements such as levels and abilities, Borderlands is a great change from survivalist shooters like Fallout, and the unique humor within the game makes for interesting characters. The DLCs add on hours of play, and entertaining stories in new locations, new bad guys, each with their own sense of comedy. I've played this multiple times (on Xbox), and this game just never gets old!"
13063,"This is like a first-person hack-and-slash RPG. Diablo in the future with guns from first person, essentially. And it gets it totally right. My only complaint is the last boss — it's completely lame. Catch a riiide!"
13064,"Though it has a unique and plausible graphics style, I have played this game for only a few hours and I already know what the rest of the game is going to be like, which sounds like a bad thing and trust me- it is.

The ""mission"" or ""quest"" system is repetitive and boring. The level of depth these missions provide feel like they were intended to be put in an MMORPG, not a singleplayer/co-op experience. I also find almost none of the characters (excluding Claptrap) to be memorable.

The game boasts that it has millions of weapons and indeed, this is true, though the quality of said weapons are barely a feat of which to be boasted, as they are all created via RNG mechanisms out of a select pool of statistics, all of which I found to be dull and unoriginal.

I know I'm seemingly the only person on the planet who dislikes this game and the rest of the Borderlands series, so this will probably be buried into irrelevance, so try it out if you wish but don't say I didn't warn you not to waste your money."

13080,"Awesome sandbox game, dlc is fun and worth it, fun to kill stuff and collect the yellow weapns!"
13081,"Good first person shooter and co-op gameplay.
It's one of my favorite games!"
13082,"Amazing game, I've played this game for a long time now; it's very addicting. People who like Role Playing Games and First Person Shooters will love this game. Constantly trying to find a better weapon or shield keeps this game interesting; you'll never know what you'll find. I've played this game for over 60 hours and I still don't get tired of it. The replay value is very high."
13083,I enjoyed this game
13084,шиково =)
13085,Poxa muito bom pra jogar com os amigos ;D
13086,Totally worth it
13087,"it was fun once and a while i guess


4/10"
13088,"This is nothing less than sheer enjoyment. The setting is a perfect combination of wild west frontier and off-world alien planet. It sets the scene for a myriad of goal based missions that though essentially based on the same mold you never get tired of going for. 

There is a point when the missions do get repetitive, around the mid-point of my second play through, but the drop-in-drop-out save by location mechanism means you can play as much as you want and leave it, till your ready for the next time.

Where Borderlands really excels though is the unique character types available and their diverging skill sets. This means you can choose a character that suits your particular play style and further customize it, to your preferred killing style - NICE!

Singleplayer is great, but multiplayer is even better...  increasing the amount of fun to be had ten-fold! It also works seemlessly so you can switch between the two types with different characters.  Weapons-wise though the range is there, the best weapon you can get hold of is essentially the one you like best. This was perhaps the biggest disappointment for me. The range is there but the differences are so slight I didnt bother changing loadout too often.

Finally the DLC are all worth getting. Ive completed ZED Island and that was significant compared to the cost. Cant wait to try the others out. All in all worth the money and then some! Can't recommend this enough."
13089,Great game to play with your mates
13090,This game is amazing. Gearbox came out with a really unique game with some amazing Co-Op gameplay and DLC to go with it.
13091,"Do you like MMORPGs? How about 4 player coop FPSs? If the answer is yes, then this game is for you. Post-apoclapictic world, 4 classes, many guns and gear. No level grinding needed and can get challenging. A bit item dependant, but not unforgiving. A bit pricey.

7 out of 10"
13092,keeps me interested
13093,"It's not half bad actually, I would give it a 9.5/10"
13094,"Do you remember what it was like to play diablo 2?

you do?


now add guns"
13095,Great game! I recommend it!
13096,"Bloody good openworld RPG, defo worth a play! The dodgy southern american scum accents are kinda funny too ;p"
13097,IT'S AMAZING. Just try it. Also best when played with friends.
13098,"Boring and repetitive fps game

3/10"
13099,I was totally hooked on this game when I first played it (I love Diablo clones) and the world of Pandora is crazy.  A much more interesting game than the bulk of FPS I've seen lately.
13100,"Borderlands was the surprise of the year to me.
I own this game outside of steam also, so the hour counter is way off.

This is a big, fun and heavy game. It is difficult and easy in the same moment.
It is a free-roam RPG with the empathise on the shooter part.

The game is most fun when played with friends or when playing alone with all the DLC packs.
The content itself is a bit repeating on the long run so you need to switch from DLC and single/multi play often."
13101,"Excellent FPS! Very fun to play, you have millions of guns to play with. And the CO-OP is just epic! Buy it, you won't regret it."
13102,just BORDERLANDS
13103,Altamente Viciante
13104,"Borderlands is a futuristic action FPS with RPG elements and an open world environment to explore.  The game takes place on the planet Pandora.  You play as a vault hunter, drawn to the planet by dreams of unimaginable wealth said to be hidden in said vault.  Along the way you'll meet a colorful cast of characters that will help or hinder your progress.  As you gain levels, you can unlock skill trees that offer various stat and skill upgrades, depending on which of the four classes you play.

The game plays a bit like an MMORPG, with various quest hubs and optional quests that yield extra loot or experience.  One of the main draws of the game is the randomized loot.  You'll find all manner of guns, from simple pistols and revolvers, to rocket launchers and even alien technology.  Sometimes they even shoot fire, lighting, poison, or hell, maybe all three.  

Graphically the game looks solid.  Although a majority of the game takes place in desert-themed environments, you'll find other locations such as a snowy mountain peak, crystal-lined caves, and in one of the available DLC, a swampy island filled with zombies!  The sound design is solid as well.  The story elements are rather sparse, mostly told through mission text, but this also makes the game easily replayable, with few cutscenes or scripted events to sit through.

The PC port is pretty shoddy.  The FOV is very low, giving things a very zoomed-in look.  There are very few graphics settings to tinker with, and most are simply toggled on or off without any more nuanced settings.  There are about 30 seconds of annoying, unskippable intro videos that play every time you start the game.  The interface was clearly designed with a controller in mind, with no effort made to adapt to a mouse-driven environment.  Generally though the game plays great with mouse+keyboard, or a controller.  I suggest looking up PC Gaming Wiki to find tweaks or work-arounds to various PC port issues.

TL;DR: Shot fire bullets at a midget while my pet bird ate his face.  10/10 THIS IS WHERE THE CARS LIVE, GET YOU ONE."
13105,"
"
13106,"A loot driven shooter done right! One of the more fun and interesting games I've played, with a unique look and feel to the visuals with a so so story that is just enough to keep you playing through till the end to find out what happens.

Great weapon designs that will keep you entertained and wanting to explore more of Pandora to get the best guns. With great tie in RPG elements and polished FPS mechanics what more could you want! 

Throw in a couple of mates to join you in co-op mode and you got the complete package. Loads of fun! :D"
13107,boom
13108,"It's like a first-person Diablo with guns.  A mind-boggling number of guns, though many of them are similar.  Couple that with very humorous writing, some quite unique characters, and some excellent gun mechanics and you've got yourself a great game.  One of the best even.

The game has a pretty artistic semi-cel shaded art style that I don't particularly like, though it fits the tone of the game pretty well.  You can turn off the black outlines on objects with a mod which makes the game look a lot cleaner.  But for general graphical quality, the game is quite good.

Now the PC version is where the game lets us down.  The interface isn't really optimized for mouse navigation so some of the menus are a bit clunky.  The FOV is sickeningly low though it can be partially fixed with a mod.  There are also a few places where the game really could have used some optimization, especially in the DLC.

But problems aside, definitely one of the best games in recent years.  You will not regret buying it (unless you're a crazy person like the maniac on the banner.)"
13109,welcome to hell
13110,Very good game. :D
13111,"Great game if you like single player or co-operative and kind of roll playing
"
13112,Great blending of RPG and FPS elements. Excellent game!
13113,"Brilliant game.  Slightly confusing at first but everything soon becomes clear, then the fun starts.  If you're new to the game try to avoid taking challenges way above your level (if they're marked impossible they are at least mega hard but not all impossible).   The shield, class mod and weapons randomised system makes the game even more interesting and addictive, as does levelling up.  Buy the GOTY edition!"
13114,86 bazillion guns bitches!!
13115,after 12 hours it's so booooooooooooooooooooooring
13116,"Borderlands is a game that takes an interesting spin on the ""FPS"" genre, of taking the elements of a progression system of an RPG game and fuse into a FPS game that has turned out really well.  As this games biggest sellpoint is the vast variety of guns that are available to use (about millions) as some are good then others, you will most likely find yourself cluttered with all these guns, if you don't manage them properly.  The game gives off an interesting art style that comes together to form real nice sceneries, even though 90% of the scenery are giant wastelands as you are set in on a different planet known as Pandora.  The story itself for me has been entertaining to listen to as you progress, the writting itself does a good job of explaining your journey, as well with great lines of Humor here and there.  The biggest problems there have been said were the lack of customization of your characters of only changing 2 colors of your person, same with your vehicles.  In all it is a satisfing and enjoyable game to take a look at, Recommended!"
13117,"es weno

13120,A great game that combines the best of FPS and RPG.  Highly recommended for fans of both genres.
13121,Super fun. Really good game even though the optimisation is bad.
13122,Just an awesome FPS-RPG
13123,"Choose your hero and prepare to plunge into Pandora's world. A loads of guns will come in very handy when you'll face bandits and the fauna itself. And yeah, Borderlands will tell you the story which won't be flogged to death if you'll start game over and over again. But also the game won't spoon-feed you and I strongly reccomend you, loser, to get friends to play it."
13124,best game i got in a while cant wait to get the next
13125,Amazing. Game. Buy it NOW.
13126,boy howdy was this a depressing game to have paid 60 dollars for when it came out
13127,"Call It Genius Call It Awesome This Game Is The Best Series Opener From Gearbox Software. You Can Enjoy Alot Of Fun With Your Friends And You Get Great Items And Equipment For Your Guy Or Girl On There. Let's Roll! XD 
Also You Can Face Many Bad Guys On This Game My Personal Favorite Bad Guy Is
Crawmerax And He Is Lvl 65 Very Strong You Might Need TeamWork On Him! So Yeah Get This Game It Is Alot Of Fun! Trust Me You Won't Forget it. 
Rating 10/10"
13128,Definitely the classic loot adventure for a bunch of friends in a comical but rough wasteland.
13129,"""Great game"" till I find better words to describe it.."
13130,The game that started the loot n shoot revolution
13131,6/10
13132,"You guys know that thing that devs do?
Where they have a first person shooter, and it's really shallow and mediocre, and then they shove forced RPG mechanics into it?
Yeah, this is kinda like that.
And you also know that thing where they have a game with a really uninteresting story and terrible writing and characters, and they make a sequel (Borderlands 2) that has an even worse story with even more obnoxious characters? They also put references to all your favourite casual games in it. Golly gee, I sure love le arrow in le knee jokes and minecraft. Haha, best indie game ever, right dude? You can put blocks on blocks and there are funny green block guys that explode.
Also, the artstyle of this game (one of the only good parts) is plagiarised.
It's got a pretty nice setting though, I'll give it that. Good Starcraft and Fallout vibes. But then again, you'd be better off playing those anyway."
13133,Best RPG FPS ever!
13134,"Borderlands was an interesting experience. I can't say much more than that. Well I could. Except I can't say anything that hasn't already been pounded in the dust by now. Yes, it's repetitive. Yes, it's basically gambling for guns. But whatever, that's every game these days. It's time to man up and use your fourty seven damage pistol to take on the last boss you fucking nancy.

7.5/10 Maybe the sequel will be better."
13135,A perfect blend of RPG and FPS.
13136,"Loot, bullets, and wacky humor.  One of the best FPS games of all time.  The low budget is apparent at times, and two of the four characters' abilities are infintely more useful than the other two, but for all it's flaws Borderlands kept me coming back for multiple playthroughs.

10/10"
13137,Very fun game to get some friends together and fuck shit up with. Yall already knew that though. Not like its one of the bestselling games on STEAM or anything *sarcasm*
13138,i never liked the graphic style they used here in this game but after playing 3 hours u stop to think about it an just enjoys what the game offers
13139,Отличная игра для сингла и мультиплеера ! Берите не раздумывая
13140,"Loads of fun if you like shooters with rpg elements mixed in. Grab some friends and shot stuff together. Definitely a game that shouldn't be passed up.
"
13141,This is just incredible fun... with a bent sense of humour that suits me.
13142,"One of the best FPS, shoot and loot games I've played. This games is full of hours of fun, especially with friends. The amount of weapons, enemies, and areas is unbelievable. You can choose between four characters to play as, each with different special abilites and skills with certain weapons. To get the full benefit, play with 3 other friends, each as a different character. The characters you play as, are known as ""Vault Hunters,"" fortune seekers looking to find the ancient treasure on the planet known as Pandora. The main story itself is hours long and time consuming, but the ending is kinda disappointing, in my opinion, but it's still a great game. There is also some DLC which doesn't really add to the story, but is very fun to play. I'd recommend getting the Game Of The Year Edition for about $7.49. I plan on getting Borderlands 2 and playing through that one with my friends too. I expect the second game to be even better than this one, with alot more weapons, enemies, and more hours of crude humor and killing things."
13143,AWESOOMEE!
13144,"This game will take your socks, slap them in your face and then feed you to the Dogs while it eats your socks. 
Very Good game. I Highly Reccommend it. Muiltiplayer is awesome, and when you get a cool new gun, don't get too attached, There's always a better one."
13145,Get it and we can have a multiplayer romp!
13146,"Amazing Game!!!

Jogo Fodástico!!!"
13147,Great shooter with some RPG elements.  Got tired of going OCD on my inventory though and deciding what weapon was best.
13148,"★☆☆☆☆

Boring, redundant, linear, tiring, terrible maneuverability (especially for the vehicles).
The design and graphic style is cool, but that doesn't make a good game though.
If you want to play it, do it with friends. It will be less painful !"
13149,Always a great time killer
13150,gooooooooooooooooood
13151,"Edgy graphics, funny characters and pretty much a solid, cool consept. Dlc's are pretty good too, apart from the Underdome...."
13152,"This game has a lot of potential to be fun but is let down by the repetitive nature of the tasks you're given, the boring world that it takes place in and the lack of any real direction or explanation on why you should do the tasks you are given. Not recommended."
13153,"One of the greatest 2K creations, Borderlands boasts a neverending replayability value and randomized loots every time you play!

Fill your inventory up to the brink, enough to make the Vault look like it's half empty!

Surely one of the best mixes between RPG and FPS ever made. Too bad the same can't be said about the sequel!

UPDATE: Many other sequels have been released since my last review, and the first installment is still the best one around. Should be dirt cheap now, don't miss on it."
13154,"Buy the game of the year edition, or you will cry; don't bother with borderlands 2 XD"
13155,"Good FPS with RPG elements. Thegame doesn't give you much choices (less than the two latest Fallout games or the latest Deus Ex) but has a good replay value, anyway."
13156,"To put it bluntly; Borderlands is what Hellgate: London should have been - FPS Diablo with all the enemy slaying and loot whoring to go with it. What it tries to do it mostly succeeds at as well, even though one cannot escape the feeling that the game was built for multiplayer at its core. Story is of ragtag nature as expected, but guns feel like guns and enemies die in gory enough details to keep you invested through the experience. One major mark against the game is the final gauntlet push and a disappointing out-of-nowhere final boss that pretty much all but killed my desire to check out the supposedly great DLC material. Maybe next time."
13157,"Borderlands is a very under-rated game. The missions are tough and rewarding, the story is decent, and the co-op action is seamless. Best played with a friend- there was one section early on I couldn't get through without help. Aside from that it was an amazing, impressively huge game."
13158,I bought this cartoony type game on a whim and bought Wolfenstein 3D at the same time.  I've wound up playing this 10 times as much.  It's quirky fun.
13159,"This game is amazing, the funny character scripts, customizing your character and all the shooting! Guns are randomly generated so you never know what you going to find! This is one loot filled shooter/RPG! I would recommend it to annyone!"
13160,The original. Need I say more?
13161,"THIS IS AWESOME. BUY IT NOW
"
13162,"cartoon violence is great
"
13163,"This game provided me with 75 hours of pure entertainment on just one playthrough with one character.  It was a little slow to get into at first, but then something just clicked and I started to really enjoy the game.  This game has pretty good shooting mechanics, great humor and style, and most of all awesome loot.  I'd like to play through this again with a different character, but I can't wait to get started on Borderlands 2 which I expect to be better in every way.  Now that this game can be bought for cheap, it offers a significant value for the money.  Must buy for shooter fans."
13164,"Awesome, crank game!"
13165,"very fun, and good story plot"
13166,"One of the best FPS/RPG i have played in my life........hmmm to be honest its the first FPS/RPG i ever played but still its a mighty kick ass game with many funny characters, tons of mindless mayhem paired with a great story, pleasant graphics and music."
13167,"This game (and all the DLC's in the GOTY version) is reletivley inexpensive today... and is a great buy for anyone who is a fan of FPS in general. While not quiet as polished as BL2, you can easily pick up and play if you are at all familiar with the second. Many many hours of fragging bandits, skags, rakks and others... lots of fun and extreme collecting abounds!. Just when you thing you're done, the DLS's add three new stories to play through, two designed as interresting 'mods' of the main game, and one all new charecters and story (General Knoxx - introduces the mechs). All in all well worth the price i paid for 50hrs of fun :)"
13168,This game is awesome!
13169,Awesome
13170,Imagine Diablo was a first person shooter. You now have this game. I hate first person shooters but the collectible nature of trying to get better and better guns is really addictive and the setting combined with cool/silly characters makes this a fantastic title for any PC gamer.
13171,.
13172,"Well polished game with lots of style. Simple gameplay that provide hours of fun. Co-op is recommended, but playing by yourself is as fine."
13173,Ich Liebe es *_*
13174,"The game that refined the RPS looting genre.
Every non-quest related weapon and armor can be considered unique.
It's a little on the shorter side but there's a lot of replay value.
It was made to be played with any number of players.

[b]9 out of 10 slag piles[/b]"
13175,Didn't know when it was going to end... I'm not really into loooong games. But it was really cool. I don't regret wandering on Pandora. I'll be back one day...
13176,Warning this game is only for cool people.
13177,Awesomenessness.
13178,"I have over 250 hours into this game on this account alone, and even more hours on my other account.  This game is incredible; it has the perfect balance of run-and-gun through the storyline and just messing around, great driving controls, interesting character classes (yes, even Brick, what's with all the Brick hate?), lots and LOTS of different guns (""6 bajillion guns!"") because all of the gun characteristics change, and great co-op play.  The DLC are fun as well, except for Moxxie's Underdome: essentially an endless stream of killing arenas, it gets incredibly boring very quickly.  It is good for warming up, though, and just sharpening your skills.  (One fantastic thing makes up for all the dullness: it has the bank, where you can stash stuff you don't need now but may want later.)   

One of my favorite games of all time.  Borderlands 2 is just as good, BTW, and I highly recommend it as well."
13179,"Well how am i going to put this... This game is simply amazing. From the single player experience to the online co-op, This game does everything right.
The NPCs humor is funny and the FPS gameplay is perfect,  the variety of weapons is mind blowing! The only disppointing part is the Mad moxxi DLC,
But Dr.Ned, Knoxx and Claptrap is a lot of fun. So to sum things up get this game!
Make sure to bring a friend to play co-op with you because it makes the game even more fun than it is.

End score - 9.5/10
"
13180,"This is probably one of the games that I have had the most fun playing. Pretty good story, great FPS aspect, and it is especially fun playing with a friend."
13181,a highly addictive shooter with Diablo-style loot hunting. Great co-op fun.
13182,"Fun, tough, fun multi-player and good FPS"
13183,"Good game, it's like Diablo-shooter."
13184,"get nooooow
"
13185,"Jogo muito viciante, principalmente se jogar no modo multiplayer (Y)"
13186,"Never really got into this game.

The second is fucking class. Buy that!"
13187,"Benefits: long campaign (20+ hours) in comparation to other modern games (10+). Solo play was boring, but much more fun in multiplayer, in which play still quite a lot of people. Mobs and bosses respawning every certain period of time or if re-create the game. Do not like that mobs are stupid. They cant jump (unlike the hero). Quite easy stay on the edge of the cliff and shoot them.
Great story DLC (except the second) 5+ hours average for complete. Detailed review  look at each DLC.
The total plot is weak but fun. Especially Claptraps and unusual representation bosses or key characters.
Result: game for coop 8/10."
13188,great gameplay
13189,"From the makers of ""Drying Paint Simulator"" and ""The Game That Is Literally Shit on a Disc"" we get a riveting tale of <ERROR 404: PLOT NOT FOUND>. Choose from a wide selection of guns that all look and behave exactly the same, just pick a color!

I hope you enjoyed the first 10 levels of World of Warcraft, because killing 5 of the same creature, then 10 of the same creature, then 20 of the same creature and a slightly bigger one with a name is this game's MO. 

Be stricken with awe as you gaze at the beatiful landscapes of Pandora, including the brown, cracked earth of the early levels to the brown, cracked earth of the later levels, all in wonderfully done post-production Made-in-China cel-shading. 

Also, anti-aliasing is for communists. Everything is a staircase, which I think is a metaphor by the developers to tell the player that no matter how high they climb, nothing will change."
13190,"Surprisingly fun game with over 24 hours of pointless, meaningless (unless murdering things is like, something super enjoyable, you freak) fun! plus, the dlc's such as mad moxxi's underdome or jakobs cove increase the fun! good game!"
13191,borderlands 2  and borderlands is fun i woud buy borderlands and finish the game and then buy buy borderlands 2.
13192,"Loved the cartoon graphics, the array of guns, the fast-paced playability and the story. Played it all the way through single player and it was only afterwards I realised you can play co-op with 4 players like Left4Dead. Unfortunately still havent tried this due to lack of friends!"
13193,One of the wackiest FPS I have ever played! This game is pure insanity. I am pretty sure this was inspired by Mad Max movies. There are too many similarities.
13194,Had All the elements I love in one place.  RPG FPS
13195,"As strange as this may sound, Borderlands is the one kind of game that you either love to hate and hate to love, simply because this game not only borrows elements from other well known FPS's, but it also takes a few elements from RPGs also, where every bit of equipment you have will go a long way until you shell out some money for something even better. The oddball humor may throw some people off, but this is what makes the game as charming as it is. It prides itself on not taking itself seriously, with the goofy dialogue from NPCs, enemies and everything in between.

All in all, this game is a definite must-have to anyone who's wanting something new and innovative while at the same time be an outright blast to play.

-------------------------

Eight Years Later...

-------------------------

Looking back on this, I can still safely say that for sure, this game is still one of the best looter shooters there are out there on the market especially with the release of the enhanced edition, but lemme focus your attention on the base game itself.

For one thing, this game's campaign if you don't include the DLC packages and side quests is MONSTROUSLY LONG. Like, we're talking anywhere between 80-90+ hours long. It'll be a massive undertaking for all parties involved, so if and when you do decide to make the trip to Pandora, you're better off bringing some friends along with you for the ride. That being said however and now that there's more to say on this, there's one thing that bothers me the most about it.

For one thing... The grind. The dreaded grind for better loot in order to get better numbers and stuff is about on par if not more massive than most RPGs. Look, I know I said in the original review I posted for this eight years ago that this game borrows a lot of RPG elements and that is still true even now. But upon picking up on my second playthrough of this - goes to show you how long it's been since I touched this - I've come to realize that there is a lot of tediousness that can and will wear you out if you play this for any lengths of time, so be sure to take yourself plenty of breaks between now and then especially when it comes to finding the better gear. But that's for solo play.

Multiplayer is... Shockingly... Nonexistent. I mean, I understand the original GameSpy servers for this shut down some time back which left people high and dry and it was an outright pain in the ass in order to migrate everything over from it to the newer servers, but I've noticed that looking for people to play with is woefully underpopulated, even if you're looking to hook up for a quickplay match or co-op.

But is this game still worth your time and investment? I guess it still is, if I can be perfectly frank with you, but at the same time, you better load up on as much painkillers, coffee and No-Doze as humanly possible, because you're in for a long trek."
13196,"Gearbox has put together a wonder of a game. With beautiful environments, varied enemies, and more guns than people on the planet Earth, Borderlands is a RPS (Role Playing Shooter) not to be missed. The gameplay is fun, engaging, and the graphics are stunningly different from any other game I can think of. Without question, this game needs to be had with its' DLCs. They add new enemies, new weapons, new environments and new challenges to the experience. With powers unique to each character, and a planetful of guns to boot, Pandora is ripe for the taking! Overall Score: 10/10"
13197,It's Borderlands. What's not to like?
13198,"I avoided this game for a long time because I thought it was a ""twitch"" shooter game; with the recent release of Borderlands 2, I learned it was a ""role-playing shooter."" So, I gave it a try. It has great narrative, exceptional voice acting, and is really, really funny! I encourage any RPG person out there to give it a try; yes, it is a shooter, but it is also very much a role-playing game."
13199,Awesome game to pass the time! Great for those who like a large variety!
13200,"Uniek RPS (RolePlayShooter).
This game is fun, & verry cool 2 play Single, ore Co-op.
FPS RPG in Cartoon style, with a good: blood guts & goore. Enjoy, have fun.
This game is not booring. It's addicting.
Also verry good controlleble with a:
XBox 360 wireless controller for Windows"
13201,ОХУЕННО!
13202,Great game. Yet to try multiplayer but heaps of fun going solo.
13203,"Excelente jugo lo recomiendo. En un momento el juego se pone aburrido, pero si lo pasas veras que es mas divertido de lo que piensas!
Se los recomiendo en especial por el cooperativo para que lo juegues con tus amigos.SI lo juegas en COop sera mas divertido aun."
13204," PLayed the second Borderlands? Then try the game that started the mass murdering gun collecting craze. Especialy those who play the PS3 and 360 versions, the original has more gore garunteed!

 Oh and it's kinda fun too :D"
13205,Vivira aun despues de mucho tiempo
13206,this game is fun to just faff about in
13207,Fantastic shooter with some light class-based RPG elements. Game was designed with cooperative play in mind and this was done very well. Humor is well written into the story and can be quite snappy at times which keeps the story entertaining. Tons of replay value with the 4 different classes and multiple playthrough mechanics. Lots of loot too. Game is a very stylized shooter-looter where the player is constantly battling foes to aquire better gear and weapons as they progress through the story. 87 Bazillion guns! What more is there to say.
13208,"Think diablo fps, but you get guns/shields as loot."
13209,"Borderlands is an SRPG, and one of the few of its kind. Everyone loves guns, and everybody loves RPGs. When you mix them together, you get something amazing. Borderlands is executed very well, with a ""variety of weapons"" being an understatement. With something over 10,000 combinations of different guns and a load of side missions, as well as four different character choices each with different abilities, it's hard to get bored. The array of different enemies keeps things interesting, with vehicles adding another interesting method of play. 

Of course, the single-player is immersive and fun, but the real game begins once you pick up a friend. The co-op in this game is incredible. Multiple cars swerving around each other, the endless loot battles and the teamwork used to kill everything (when you aren't rushing for the drops) when the difficulty is up makes everything a lot better. The graphics are unique and the gameplay is great. You'll spend hours on this, and you won't reget it."
13210,"Borderlands is a very big world to explore with your friends. I first saw my little brother play Borderlands on the Xbox360 and at first I really didn't feel like the game was my type. More of a shooter than a RPG. But after buying it for the PC and playing for a while I found it was a lot of fun! At first I started a Co-op game, but someone just desided after a couple hours of playing they would never play again so I ended up switching to a single player game. I have made two characters, a Hunter and a Siren. the hunter is more of a sniper I found. The Siren I found myself useing her as a burst damage, I would phase walk into a melee with a shotgun. The Hunter I mainly sniped and only used a Shotgun for things that crawled up behind me to scare me. I fell in love with the game and only wish I had more friends that could have been there to enjoy it with me!"
13211,"Awesome doesn't begin to descibe this game.  

Buy it, play it."
13212,"""Borderlands"" -  Необычная, интерсная, впечатляющая! Игра очень понравилась, мультяшная графика, интригующий сюжет, ко-оп, жаль нет мультиплеера, тогда бы было ещё круче!) 
Она не стандартна, у неё свой стиль!

Итог : 9\10"
13213,"As a game I originally dismissed as a cheap Fallout 3 knockoff, I've probably put in twice as many hours as I did into Fallout 3. Borderlands is amazing, fun gameplay, crazy loot, awesome humor, and the style/art direction is completely fitting. Buy this game."
13214,"Looking for high quality RPG? Varied, trigger-happy FPS? This is neither of them... seriously. But take the most essential elements of both, add some desert feeling, many Fallout, Mad Max and other references, stir... tada! Here goes Borderlands!

To be honest, this game is boring. Boring and fascinating and the same time. And you will keep on playing, wondering why you, in fact, aren't bored at all, while you should have been since at least 30 hours :)

OK, some serious facts: cunning cell-shaded graphics, crude humor, and some happy brainless shooting; very recommendable. I'd give it 9/10 (or 9.5/10, if you're Fallout fan :))

And about comparison to Fallout 3, which was probably the first thought that came into my mind after launching the game: it's better than F3 in two ways:
- it's not Fallout :) I mean, Borderlands will not be compared to any of its prequels, since there simply are none
- Borderlands doesn't pretend to be RPG; it's just FPS/RPG mashup :)"
13215,yu
13216,One of the best shooters out there.
13217,"Pure unadulterated fun. I didn't want to like it but fell in love with it. Superb graphics, awesome art design, cool gameplay (even better with friends), and a humor second to none, Borderlands is one of the most pleasant gaming surprises in years."
13218,"Borderlands is a pretty darn good FPS RPG. The lore is interesting and varied enough to keep pushing forward and the ability to upgrade weapons seems to always be right around the corner.

Why don't they make an MMORPG like this?

PROS: Fun to play with a friend, most enemies are tough enough without being too tough. Pandora is actually a pretty neat little world and fun to play in. The RPG elements are fun. Leveling up is not a grind and the skill tree is pretty varied.

CONS: This game has tons upon tons of weapons but despite this fact it's still sometimes very hard to find a good upgrade, Claptrap annoys me, the World of Pandora is cool but sometimes feels a little small, wish there were more vehicles.

In my opinion the pros out way the cons by a very large margin. I really enjoy this game. 9/10"
13219,"It's AWESOME!
"
13220,"Borderlands has two things to give out... ass kickings and story-line, and it ran out of story-line."
13221,There's not a lot of story but there is a lot of shooting.
13222,"It's fun whether playing solo or going as a group. I like the whole power building aspects of it. 

I had two playthroughs. One as Mordicai (the sniper) and one as Lillith (the siren). it's a lot easier and more entertaining to be Lillith. 

Sniping is alright, but when you get stuck in enclosed areas you can't do so well. Plus in co-op your bullets get blocked by your friends (who are always between you and the enemy) so sniping isn't all it's cracked up to be.

Siren rocks. You can use any weapon with total efficiency making her awesome in any situation. Plus she has the power to poof invisable and be super fast so she can run away if she gets overwhelmed by enemies. Just run away/behind cover, heal, return. She's OP, but fun."
13223,"The base game is a solid shooter with good mechanics and a neat art style. The world they've built feels appreciably different from most wastelands. It can get a little grindy, so don't feel like you have to complete all the side quests. Avoid the DLC at all costs - they each have some pretty bad core design issues that exacerbate the grindy aspects of the franchise."
13224,"Interesting graphics although it's just an average-poor FPS game. The save game is locally stored and be easily hacked, so don't mind wasting a lot of time grinding enemies to level up. Once beaten, there is not much replayability so I can't recommend it."
13225,Its a Really FUN GAME!
13226,"Guns... guns... GUNS!!!! Epic LOOT AND GUNS! No seriously, this is a really fun Co-Op FPS Dungeon crawler with guns as loot. nearly unlimited combinations and styles of guns. Its cheap now so pick it up with all the DLC and have a blast."
13227,"Borderlands is a shooting gallery with loot pinatas. If you like shooting games and you love seeing loot rain from the corpses of your enemies, you will definitely love what Borderlands has to offer. Apart from seemingless infinite guns, grenades, shields, and satisfying gun combat, the remaining features of Borderlands are stale and poorly developed. Skill trees lacks true diversity, and class balance leaves a lot of be desired. The story is horrifyingly weak, with quite frankly one of the dumbest ending I have ever seen. Character development is hit or miss. Characters like Claptrap and Scooter are hilarious with very fun dialogues while the supposed antagonist was absolutely retarded with almost no development. While gun variety is plentiful, environment is boring, brown, and dull. I have no fucking clue how Borderlands got Game of the Year, perhaps pc games in 2009 were truly shit."
13228,"10/10 If you dont have it, get it!"
13229,"For a FPS, this game is very relaxing. Blasting and Relaxing. Music is good, tons of guns to choose from."
13230,One of my fave games ever :P
13231,Had fun so much fun in Borderlands I started playing Mexico and ended up in America. #TYBG
13232,"A modern FPS done right. Has the feel of a classic twitch shooter; fast pace, unrealistic, and fuuuunnn. Has just enough RPG elements to make it unique in a market saturated with stale Call of Dutys and Halos. Levels, skill trees, and tons loot keep the gameplay interesting and unique enough to be very different each playthrough. You'll always be hunting for a better gun that you have, because there are just so many. Play 3 friends for the best experience. Definitely in my top 3 games of the past 10 years."
13233, Borderlands !!
13234,"Awesome, nothing more is needed to be said"
13235,Awesome
13236,"Not much story, but a good shooter.

"
13237,I give this game 4 licks.
13238,FORGE A BRIGHT AND BOUNTIFUL FUTURE IN A MAGNIFICENT WORLD WHERE A VARIETY OF FIREARMS ARE FREELY AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL. NATURE SHALL TAKE ITS COURSE. YOUR PATH TO FORTUNE SHALL BE PAVED WITH THE CORPSES OF LOCAL FAUNA AND ALSO YOUR ENEMIES
13239,One of the most fun FPSs I have ever played.   I'm addicted!
13240,Vault man... Vault.
13241,Cell shaded apocalyptic chaos at it's best.
13242,A must have game 10/10
13243,"Extremely hilarious and fun game.  There are some minor issues with the game, but the overall story and massive amounts of loot make up for the issues.  Co-Op is very fun, but you can play the game completely solo through multiple playthroughs.  Try out different classes to find out your playstyle.  I found that Roland was the best for me since he can regenerate ammo non-stop.  Since that is the case, I was able to hold down my fire button and never let go.  There are many possibilites in the game and it's worth the purchase just to see what guns you get at random!  Highly recommend!"
13244,"Guns
"
13245,"While the PC port is a little wonky and it could use more depth, it's a fun little adventure with a lot of missions and content with an open-world feel similar to Fallout, but more heavily loot-based and Co-Operative. It has a few shallow features but semi-addicting playstyles that make it much better to play with a friend or three. The visuals, script, and sounds are unique and well balanced, though could be more refined. 7/10"
13246,This game is pretty damn good.  I need to hurry up and beat it so I can play part 2.
13247,"Superb FPS with just the right amount of RPG mixed in. Also MANY MANY GUNS!
Sure the ending's kinda shitty, but it's a hell of a ride the get there."
13248,"Fun game, AI is stupid as shit likes to rush you often,but when they have you covered at all angles get ready for a fight for your life. I like the game which is saying a lot cuz I am not a heavy fps fan. Has 4 different classes,a decent amount of guns,open world (Mad Max Style) environment, and chuck full of replay based on how you play with the chars you pick. 

Even though the AI is dense as fog, its still fun to hunt them ,snipe them,rocket launch them,etc and they are and not dumb enough that the game is pointless to play.. The game is just right,not to great,not crappy. Out of 100 I give BL1 GOTY about 75. If you want it,pick it up when it on sale for %75 off. Wont be a waste of your funds at all."
13249,"
"
13250,"Big guns, loot, fun, what else do you want, coop, is right here too."
13251,"I almost feel like it's a bit late to be writing a review for this. Sometimes it seems like everyone's already played it, and yet I still find people who haven't gotten around to it yet. 

First of all; I don't normally play 'fps' style games. And I don't play a lot of multiplayer games, either. But I absolutely adored this one. I own it both on XB360 and here on steam, and have played it through on both. The classes offered are different enough to enourage replayability and co-op works wonderfully. While playing multiplayer is recommended,  single player is just as enjoyable, especially first time through. If you absolutely must play multiplayer, try and find someone who hasn't played it yet either so that they're not just dragging you along or rushing you through cutscenes and dialog due to general memorization of the quests. 

The dialogue/plot is worth taking your time for. The writing is superb and really makes the game worthwhile. Read all the flavor text, talk to everyone. Really explore the world. You won't regret it."
13252,One of the best co-op experience I ever had. Weapon porn. Farming. Stupid enemies. Bullet flood. I'll definetely play the second opus.
13253,Play it. Love it. Play it again. Get the DLC. Play them all. Beat the whole game + DLC all over again.
13254,Boredomlands
13255,"An awful piece of tripe and one monotonous dredge of a video game. Feels devoid of any sort of passion and was likely slapped together using the results of focus groups to appeal to the least common denominator. Its only redeeming quality is its art style. If you like boredom and slow-paced, Call of Duty bro-shooting with an infinite supply of unremarkable guns, a boring/non-existant story, a setting that is huge in scale to pad out game length and  lacks any variety and is entirely unfun to explore, endless fetch quests, monotonous music, consoley controls, horrible FOV, a terrible user interface, and humor that is 99% references or jokes that fall flat on their face before the set up, then this piece of shit is for you.

Overall, I give Borederlands a 0 out of 1000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000"

Entre les gnomes qui foncent en hurlant, un hache à la main, les pyromanes suicidaires et les cow-boys dont le refuge est une immense grue à scier, la faune locale est loin d'être accueillante, mais avec 87 milliards d'armes à votre disposition, le répondant est bien présent. Enclanchez le chargeur, appuyez sur la gachette et amusez-vous. Ca va saigner."
13260,"If you don't have Borderlands by now you really missed out on a great game. Borderlands mixes MMO style RPG elements with a FPS game.  Solo play can be fun, but where Borderlands shines is in its multi-player experience. There are no level requirements for playing together, no party xp nerfing, and you gain xp no matter how far away you are from the rest of your team. This means you can split up and accomplish different objectives, or leave the lowest level player at the quest turn-in spot while you move from quest to quest. Gameplay is gory and funny. Some of it can feel repetitive and long play streatches begin to suffer as you find yourself running over the same ground and killing the enemies spawning from the same den over and over. Also, end game is a bit of a disappoint. With all that said, this game is still worth the $20 for the base game. I haven't played the DLC, but some of it seems to link into Borderlands 2 if you care a great deal about story."
13261,Its like L4D meets crack cocaine and win
13262,ahh old classic lan party game

13264,"Amazing lootfest / RPG / first-person shooter hybrid. Hilarious dialogue and pop-culture references are employed flawlessly into the creation of an awesome experience. The story is a little too subtle for this kind of game, and in many places it falls flat, but the sheer addictiveness, smooth gameplay, and insane replayability make this a game you can't afford to miss."
13265,"Where do I start, the game keeps you interested, even after many hours of gameplay. Sure it is repetitive, but with how this feature is woven into the gameplay, you never notice it. That game is mind-blowingly madness and great with a friend, playing co-op, and is definatively worth $30 for the GOTY edition. I highly recommend it."
13266,De loin l'un des jeux ou je me suis le plus amusé depuis la série des Fallout !
13267,top game
13268,"FPS Diablo FTW! Borderlands is a great game. 4 different classes, with all different skill trees. Every character can wield any weapon and gets better with it, by simply using it. Of course it's smarter to have the sniper use sniper rifles, but hey, I was having fun with my shotgun. Which brings us to loot. Most weapons are randomly generated, although there ARE legendaries. Like in Diablo (talking about Diablo II NOT 3) sometimes your ""crappy"" rare rifle is a lot better than that shiny unique one. I liked that a lot,because finding a unique one didnt mean you found something good. The story is boring, but it's the gameplay that keeps you entertained for quite some time! Quests are all of the same kind : find me x of these, or kill y of those,etc...What I'm telling you is : DONT PLAY IT ALONE. Playing with a least one friend is AWESOME. Playing it alone... not so much. 
As to the DLCs : Only buy The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned. The rest sucks."
13269,Highly addictive FPS with lots of guns and fun.

13271,"Crap ass story, reasonably good shooter, unique cell shaded world that's not really as open as it might seem. But the loot, THE LOOT! Haven't had so much fun running around collecting loot (that I'll be discarding in 3 levels for ever so slightly better loot ) since Diablo 2. It's just got that hook for me; dangerously addictive.

8/10"
13272,"I'm a gamer who perfers adventure and RPG types of games, so picking up a FPS game has never occurred or crossed my mind. However, due to a good review from my sister who has played this game with her friends, I figured I'd try it out as well along with the hope of possibly playing co-op with my sister later on down the line. 

Needless to say, the game still has playability after almost 90 hours (as of 17 Sept 2012) into the game, playthrough two untouched all this time as well. The graphics are unique and the main storyline is better than I thought it would be. I still have the four DLCs to start and finish sometime before getting into the ""hard"" mode of this game.

Recommended for those who like FPS. Warning though, if you get motion-sickness, play the game in short doses like I do. It'll save you a ton of headaches/strain later."
13273,"fun and cheap game, cool graphics...little bit of the same thing throughout but still awesome"

13275,If you at all like the old west & post-apocalyptic games at all then you should try Borderlands!
13276,"One of the best FPS-rpg styled gamed that I've ever played. It's an Epic Must-Own.

If you disagree and didn't like it, it's because you suck at it. HAhahah."
13277,"Wer rein zufällig eine Gewalt- und Ballerorgie sucht, die viel von einem guten RPG hat, der sollte sich den PRS und seinen bald erscheinenden Nachfolger nicht entgehen lassen."
13278,It's awesome. And you should try it.
13279,"A bazillion very satisfying guns and cracking humour and art style make this game fun to play over and over. 

Worth buying for Claptrap breakdancing and Cage the Elephant's theme song alone.

""There ain't no rest for the wicked..."""
13280,First person shooter ARPG.  Amazing.  Diablo with guns.
13281,It's good.
13282,Amazing game.
13283,"12/10, amazing freaking game."
13284,Always Co-op. Never not Co-op.
13285,You have already played this game if you haven't the fuck is wrong with you
13286,"Lots of guns. Those are probably the most accurate three words to desribe Borderlands. The game has a long story (about 30 hours if you do all the missions) and a large variety of enemies to shoot. Classes have a lot of upgrade paths, and there is a big payoff for searching everywhere for hidden items. A lot of them kick serious ass. Unfortunately, the bosses are a total joke, and the storyline is very generic and boring. This is not the kind of game for someone looking for engaging characters and plot twists. Despite its faults, this is truly a great game."
13287,"great
"
13288,"A Hell of alot of FUN to be had in Borderlands!, 4 player CO-OP and so many guns and things to kill... and the LOOT, So much and the characters are funny and have a good story line and can be had hundreds of hours of gameplay! get it if you want a game with very interesting gameplay and art style so yes 10/10 from me!"
13289,Epic Game - 4 ways to play and even the second playthrough will up the ante - I RARELY pre purchase a game but Borderlands 2 made the cut because of this classic.
13290,"Funny, best of RPG and FPS, what more needs to be said"
13291,"Diablo meets FPS meets whimsical sense of humor. Fun for a playthrough even if loot-hunting isn't your thing, though it is the meat of the game for many."
13292,great game - i hope borderlands 2 is as good :)
13293,Fun as crap!
13294,Great game. The co-op is excellent and there is always something new to do with your friends. If you like shooting stuff and collecting sweet guns then this is the game for you. Easily 80+ hours with the multiple New Game+ modes and 4 playable characters.
13295,"Soon the sequal comes, buy this one until then :P"
13296,"Fun, very good battle system/leveling up system. Recommended for all you FPS/RPG fans. Quests were also fun. Also very good multiplayer system!"
13297,"Just get it. Go on, do it. You won't regret it. Why are you still reading? You should be at the checkout."
13298,"Respect +++ for Gearbox, to bring this game!"
13299,Best signle player and coop fun ever
13300,This game is awesome. Better if you play with a friend.
13301,Fun as hell.
13302,Crazy Fun
13303,"Quite a lot of fun. Although I would not credit it with being the first game to merge both RPG and FPS, I would credit it with a great deal of originality."
13304,"This game is kick ass......also I'm just adding this to get the steam achievement,"
13305,"Cool game, the graphics are a bit strange at first, but you get used  to it rather quicly. The gameplay is fantastic though!"
13306,"This game should be experienced co-op with 2-3 other gamers.

In co-op you'll have s**tloads of fun shooting and looting your way to that particular final scene, which might leave you looking for more...fortunately there are several more hours you can spend in the DLC's - not to mention Borderlands 2 which will be out soon.

Single player mode - not so much. It gets quite dull and repetative without any buddies to share the fun with.

9/10"
13307,Its just fun...so play it.
13308,Good Game!
13309,"It's a pretty great game IMO, very pretty on the PC more so than on the PS3"
13310,pancakes
13311,You should get this game to prep for Borderlands 2. NOW.
13312,Bazzillions of guns and really great storyline. I'm really looking forward to the second part of it.
13313,"Wonderful game. The perfection for a mix between FPS and RPG. If you like Fallout, then you'll love Borderlands. For the first time ever after finishing a game, I felt a huge urge to play it throu and finish it again, so I guess that tells how addictive this game is. Multiplayer is orgasmic.
Sure, technically it looks outdated these days, especially compared to the second Borderlands, but in my opinion this one is MUCH more fun than BL2 (whose campaign was mostly targetted for co-op, because it's pretty hard when played alone). Besides, it has some decent jokes without being too retarded/silly compared to BL2. 
This is one of the best videogame ever made (if not the best), so highly recommended!"
13314,Finally a FPS that isn't over inside of 20 minutes. It's got a great sence of humour and is challenging but not so difficult as to be impossible!
13315,"buy this shit, buy your friends this shit, fucking laugh as you shoot shell shaded motherfuckers"
13316,"Fun game to play with friends, but the sequel will probably be even better so just play that."
13317,Fun as hell
13318,"Good and entertaining game, though a bit drawn out in certain situations, but the humor and graphics are excellent! The game gets better towards the end and the DLC content is top notch!

Rating: 8/10"
13319,"Одна из лучших игр в своем жанре, правда скучная немного, но если играть в коопе то норм, также понравился сам геймплей, мир, персонажи, все это на высоте, игра заслуживает своих твердые 7 из 10, жду вторую часть"
13320,"Borderlands is an absolute blast of a game, no pun intended! Fans of first person shooters and roleplaying games will be in hog heaven with Borderlands excellent shooting mechanics, and the bazillions of guns, along with the lite RPG elements of it's character upgrade system. I spent many hours in this game and can't wait for the sequel. The only thing I did miss out on was the co-op play....I never got to play with anyone...just playin' with myself...hehehehe!"
13321,"A unique FPS hack n' slash with lots of cool guns, check it out!"
13322,Fun FPSRPG . not too fun solo and you have to beat the same content 3 times to get max lvl but the DLC is a nice way to take away from the grind . but the concept is awesome and its got a lot of humorous moments
13323,"probably the craziest shooter i've ever played, and no matter how many times i beat it, i keep coming back! don't miss this game it's well worth the money for it!"
13324,"The addictiveness of looting from MMOs, with the excitement of first person shooters, and the colorful landscape of cell shaded alien worlds all come together like a peanut butter and chocolatey goodness that is... Borderlands!"
13325,AMAZING. it's skyrim only with guns and co-op. Best game EVAR. Can't wait for the second one. Comes out on the 17th of September
13326,Good old head shooting/bashing fun.
13327,Great little FPS/RPG gear grinder.
13328,"I don't get the whole Borderlands phenomenon.
I never really falled in love with it...its WoW met Fallout3, sound good but it isn't.
it have the repetitive grinding of WoW with the lame context of theirs missions and a weak general story mixed with a bad shooting mechanic.
Ah and the HUB and menu interfaces sucks as well.
i still recommand it in coop but nor really in solo.
perhaps Bordelands2 will be better but i doubt it."
13329,Play this shit.
13330,"I was late to the whole Borderlands party. I'd initially avoided the game because it didn't look like something I'd enjoy, the main turn off being the art style of the cartoon like outlines or whatever you'd like to call them. I first played the game about a year after release and it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be... in fact it was really fun even playing it solo.

The story is a good laugh, all though it did take me two serrious attempts to accutually finish the game. I lost intrest half way through after about 30 hours because it's very repedative. All the quests are pretty much go here and get 'x' or do 'x' at 'y' while the reasons for x and y can be funny it doesn't change the fact that there isn't much varience in it.

DLC is fantastic, more well written stories and side tracks for you to explore.

Overall, fun and funny. I can see the appeal if you have a bunch of friends for co-op but solo is really fun too so don't let not having friends to play it with deter you!

I got about 60 hours out of it including finishing the story, most of side missions and all the DLC missions. Worth about $20 including all DLC.

Gameplay: 8.5/10
Graphics: 9/10
Sound: 9/10
Overall: 8.8/10"
13331,"Alter, eins der besten Titel die ich je gespielt habe."
13332,"In my top 3 games of all time.  Great fun, good looking and fun to play.  Co-op is at the center of this game and I've spent hours playing it just that way.  The sequel looks good too but not for $60"
13333,"Очень смешная (в особенности DLC), красивая игра в которой много, ну очень много... нет... в ней миллионый разнообразного лута. Удобный кооп, в котором хорошо будет играться с друзьями."
13334,
13335,FPS and RPG made a baby...and it is AMAZING :D
13336,Um...because it's awesome!!
13337,"if this is good, borderlands 2 is gonna be kick ass."
13338,yes.
13339,PLAY THIS.  FUCK.
13340,"Ah Borderlands, in a nutshell: The hit comically over-the-top Co-Op FPS Action RPG | Co-op Looter-Shooter with built-in ""Your Mom's girl parts"" jokes.

There are 4 Character Classes customised through 3 Skill Trees providing a good range for practically all play styles. Each class has one unique Action ability which can be further modified via class skills. As this is a shooter your arsenal of a bazillion dynamically generated guns with unique abilities play a larger role in the game so you don't miss the hotbar full of abilities you might have in other RPGs much. And you'll be using those guns to blast through a variety of enemies ranging from zany midget bandits to epic sized wild game creatures and beyond.

Borderlands is chaotic fun no matter the problems it has BUT it's definitely despite a couple of main issues which revolve around Over-leveling(*) and Damage Scaling(**) when co-oping with characters more than a few levels apart:

(*) ~ Because of the way the designers set mission difficulty (and the lack of difficulty scaling for missions & enemies) in [i]PlayThrough 1 & 2[/i] of the game, it's very easy to completely over-level your character making the majority of the game a cake walk even into the DLCs.
Basically you will become over-leveled relative to Borderlands' mission content if:
-You do a few too many sidequests - You'll over-level.
-You join another person's campaign, gain a few levels and return to your campaign - You're over-leveled.
-You always kill respawned enemies in the way to your next objectives - You'll probably over-level.

(**) ~ Your damage is [u]scaled based on your level vs. your target's level[/u]. So if for example you have a good gun with a damage stat capable of killing the target in a few shots but you are 5 levels lower than your target - Your damage will be scaled down so that the shots will barely hurt the enemy, any lower level and it gets even more unplayable very fast. If you are higher level you'll cut the enemy down in extra quick time because you'll get a damage boost.
That becomes super annoying when trying to get friends of different levels together in a game or if you end up joining a host/campaign which is +|- more than a few levels from your char's.

The issue with over-leveling/no-difficulty-scaling was kind-of addressed with the last DLC release which, after PlayThrough2 of the original Borderlands campaign, makes the content scale to your char's level .. but again, that only happens at the end of Borderlands' campaign PT2 when you have practically completed the original campaign twice and it is flat scaling.

[i](Note: Dead Island (think of it as Borderlands' younger zombie brother title) already addressed many of the difficulty issues that Borderlands had using Challenge/Difficulty Rating based Scaled missions to prevent things like over-leveling while still allowing the campaign design to have easy sections and harder challenges. On top of that a later DI patch introduced per-player enemy scaling option which allows wildy different level characters to play together - higher level chars still benefit from their skill bonuses and probably having rarer weapons while lower level chars can still contribute to the fight effectively instead of being squishy zombie fodder.)[/i]

To wrap up: Borderlands is great for some chaotic co-op looting & shooting with a light sense of humour, it has a few issues left in here and there from it's long prototyping & development phase over at Gear Box but it's still great fun to play.

Bring on Borderlands 2 which is looking great and has already shown that it's addressed many of the first's issues, but I really hope Gear Box have used some sort of Challenge Rating based scaling to prevent over-leveling and make it easier for people to freely play in any number of different matchs of different player levels using the same character."
13341,"Well, I pre-order the Borderlands 2 because this game. That's all."
13342,Borderlands isn't a game... it's an addiction.
13343,This is a MUST PLAY game!!!
13344,Awesome
13345,"A great, entertaining and addictive FPS with Diablo-like elements and an immense variety of weapons. Irresistibly enjoyable in co-op multiplayer."
13346,"gearbox software Borderlands is a game that set in desert plant call Pandora you play as a hunter brute solder or siren that just get off a bus looking for unowned treasure in a vault that may or may not be real but you accompany by vault angle and few other crazy characters in the mix like clap trap a crazy robot that lives in Pandora and DR. Zed the unlicensed doctor in way the characters are fun but lacks life see the NPC just talk to you on a radio even if you meet them in person to do a mission they still just speak to you on your radio but game play make up for that with random and unlimited weapons every weapon is different from the other to shotgun that shoots rockets to alien weapons the game is just fun like just shooting bandits never get old and if you have friend over or online well it just got better so I give this game a 9.5  
"
13347,"Mother-effin' Borderlands, man. I played the hell out of this on PS3, still one of my all time favorite games."
13348,"If you have not heard of Borderlands yet, crawl out from whatever rock you are living under and get with the times! Just off the wall fun is what I would say to descripe this game.

Graphics are cartoony but fantastic. Voice acting is top notch, an easy 10/10. The script and random banter is the best I have ever seen in a video game, I can't count how many times I would burst out laughing just listening to conversations. Exellent FPS elements and RPG elements, unlike most that try to do both and fail miserably, Gearbox did a fantastic job with this. DLC's are all well worth the price (or just purchase the GOTY edition). Single player is fun but if you can some friends to play, coop is the best! Replayability is also high due to the randomness of the game, the new game+ mode and leveled up monsters.

You owe it to yourself to play this through at least once before the also amazing looking Borderlands 2 is released."
13349,Wacky game with a diffrent artistic style that makes it unique from all the other Games.
13350,"FPS+RPG=AWESOME!!! Borderlands has thousands of weapons and enemies. You can explore the planet Pandora with distinctive 4 classes. Shoot, kill, and loot. Each class has many skills too. I don't like FPS usually but this one? I love it!"
13351,Absolutely awesome co-op game! Play with friends!
13352,игра порадовала
13353,"Borderlands is a game that you will think is absolute crap unless you play it with friends. It's whole singleplayer revolves around it. If you are thinking you'll be able to run through this game without friends, you'll be dissapointed.

DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?! YOU NEED TO PLAY THIS WITH FRIENDS!!!"
13354,This is so awesome.
13355,My best game of all time. Sold my ps3 version so i could get it on steam.
13356,"good fun game
"
13357,It's good
13358,★★☆
13359,Świetna gra przy której nie sposób się dobrze nie bawić jak najbardziej godna polecenia.
13360,"Awesome RPG/FPS blend. This game has done almost everything right. Amazing COOP? Check. Cool world/bosses/enemies? Check. Boring repetitive quests? Check.

It's a lot of fun with friends."
13361,If I ever find out you haven't played this game I'm going to beat the shit out of you.
13362,Great game! classic shooter with a satisfying leveling system. The games main story line  dose feel a bit short.
13363,"best game ever. Its a fun adventure that you can play with friends plus all the blood and swearing you want. If you do get it, get the game of the year addition, it adds so much more for a small price."
13364,Fun addictive game and great mutiplayer co-op with friends.
13365,Kickass
13366,"Elegancka Gra 9/10 :)

Plusy:
+ Gazylion sprzętów i broni
+ Interesująca oprawa graficzna
+ Tryb kooperacji"
13367,"This game is just amazing, GO BUY IT!!"
13368,Lilith is the voice actor for Scanty. 10/10 Great Game
13369,Dosent get better than this!
13370,quality game especialy if you purchase the GOTY edition with all dlc included never get bored of this game really looking forward to number 2 :)
13371,"This game is a hell of a lot of fun - not really the FPS/RPG hybrid it promises to be, but has all the fun parts of the MMO grind without any of the stress of keeping up with the latest raid/craftng/gear. Also most of the time you get to be really kick-ass, which is cool."
13372,More like Boringlands.
13373,"i know its late (BL2 will release soon) but if you have not played it, its well worth a look, specailly as its so cheap now. great game well worth full price let alone what you can get it for now"
13374,This is like tf2 except only 4 people can play and there's only one team.
13375,"Borderlands is one of those games that you play for fun. While the story will not win any awards, it does not leave you hanging with a big question mark in the end. The gameplay is more than enough to carry this game to the top alone. Besides, who doesn't fall in love with Claptraps?"
13376,"FPS 디아블로라 불리울 정도로 중독성과 재미로 무장한 2K Games의 대작!
강화시스템은 없지만, 아이템의 종류가 수백가지라니 모으는 재미도 쏠쏠하다!
또, 카툰렌더링 기법의 그래픽은 독특하고 게임의 재미를 더해준다!
마지막으로, 타격감 또한 일품이니 PC 게이머라면 한번쯤 해봐야하는 보더랜드 
강력추천한다!"
13377,A lot of fun to play with a group of buddys!
13378,Addictive as all hell once you get into it
13379,Borderlands!!!!!
13380,Extremely addicting.
13381,"Borderlands is a good Role-playing FPS containing somewhat basic storyline, arcady combat, and a cartoonish graphic style. The game's story isnt very long taking players sround 10 hours more or less to beat alone including side quest and even then the player wont be at the top level leaving players wanting to go another playthough and obtain better weapons/equipment.The game has limitless amount of guns by the way. Players play one of four classes/characters and through leveling the player can unlock points to spend to improve their character in ways such as improved health, increased weapon damage, etc and unlock small abilities such as shooting your teamates to heal em'. Each class has a class specific ability. Players can play alone or 4 player co-op/versus and co-op is where this game shines. Playing with 3 friends is entertaining because enemies get harder with more players present and better loot is dropped. Players can fight each other too, in arenas or by 1v1 duals anywhere."
13382,claptrap
13383,Epicosity
13384,If you want  violence blood and idiotic humor this game is for you!  Excellent Replayability/
13385,Bellissimo mix di RPG ed FPS. Bel gioco dalle richieste non proibitive e molto appassionante soprattutto in multy
13386,Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooot.
13387,"Non-stop crazy stuff, with real cartoon graphics!"
13388,+1
13389,"This is not an FPS.  It is not an RPG.  It is an RPS.  A Role Playing Shooter.  It has got over 17,000,000 variations of gun, mods that help you and your friends in co-op, and shields that heal you, or make you resilient to certain types of attacks.  This game is legit and very fun.  Its graphics are impressive.  It also includes 4 DLC.  These DLC range from battling an unstoppable horde of zombies, to fighting in an arena surrounded by powerful opponents.  Try it, then try out its sequel, which is coming out next month."
13390,"fun game, graphics for some ppl like myself are a little hard on the eyes and the last boss is such an utter joke it's beyond defining."
13391,"Play the role of one of four illegal imigrants from Mexico trying to sneak into America in order to steal all of the white man's jobs, welfare, food stams, and white women in this class based exercise in xenophobia."
13392,"Diablo 2 if it were a first person shooter.  What's not to like?  If you're a typical FPS player, keep in mind that with a cardboard gun and a low level character you wont be droppin' diesels with simply a single shot to the dome.  Borderlands don't play that.  You DO however.. do much more damage. So skill is not lost on this rpg/skill tree game.  Fun solo, more fun with a friend.  With the exception of Mad Moxxi's whatever whatever, it has good dlc.  Not much in the way of customization, plenty in the way your character plays.  There's a tanky melee damage soak who gets in their face and uses demolitions, a sniper who makes short work of anything with a soft spot (with a bit of skill), a jack of all trades support character who is a go-to-guy for enduring combat, and a stealth burst damage dps assassin."
13393,Best co-op game ever!
13394,Great engine & gameplay... a game that gives you the best satisfaction when you play with some friends!
13395,"This game is crazy, the good kind of crazy."
13396,"Thorough entertainment, great adventure.. and enough guns for a lifetime."
13397,"Theres no FPS Team shooter quite like this one, everything in this game is badass. Don't let the cartoony cell shading change your mind about buying this game, because this game by all means is anything but childish. Rank up your skills, kill the most badass bosses and gain some incredible loot, considering you can play with up to three friends in a game in a big world like pandora, the badassness never ends!"
13398,"Best. Game. Ever!

JUST PLAY IT ALREADY!!"
13399,"
"
13400,"Ay mang, dis shit iz lyk crack ya see, u go round shootin shit to get mo shit to shoot mo shit."
13401,"Em um mundo de caos pós-apôcaliptico, você precisa sobreviver a tudo e a todos.
Enfrentando desde um simples cachorro mutante ate teus supostos amigos para garantir tua sobrevivencia.
Borderlands é um FPS/RPG que se passa num Ambiente devastado por monstros mutantes e ladrões do deserto, que querem te ver morto.
Esse jogo garante uma boa diversão, tanto no modo single como no cooperative (o que torna o jogo formidável)
Recomendo que comprem a versão do jogo do ano, que contém os ""dlcs"".
Pois o final do jogo principal não é lá essas coisas. O jogo possui 4 personagens jogaveis, No qual possuem habilidades expecificas... o que faz com que o replay seja inevitavel. 
"
13402,This game its awesome.
13403,What....umm hell yeahs bitches!!
13404,"Sweet Game!
"
13405,"I got this game during a Steam sale, and I've really enjoyed it.  I'll have to get Borderlands 2 when it comes out to continue the carnage."
13406,Getting ready for number 2!
13407,Gud.
13408,"I don't think perfection exists in gaming, but if there was one title to come close, it'd be Borderlands. The game has a large, interesting world to explore, a bajillion weapons to do your business with, hilarious characters and dialogue, a lengthy campaign (40-60 hours) and is ultimately is one of the most fun FPS titles around.

When's the last time you laughed out loud while gaming? If you can't remember, you surely haven't played Borderlands. Perhaps the best part? The game supports co-op for up to three friends, and to me, that's how the game -should- be enjoyed. This is one of my top 10 favorite PC games of all time."
13409,"One of the best games ever when it comes to having fun IMO, millions of guns to mess around with and a lovely scenery and characters, that also brings you a good laugh, must have must play!"
13410,great game. I've been looking for such an online FPS RPG game for some time. unique!
13411,is kiss me
13412,Love this game.  I have no idea how I haven't played this until now.  Perfect mix of shooter and RPG.
13413,"This ending sucks.
"
13414,"An extraordinary experience, a must-play for Action RPG games."
13415,"If you enjoy Diablo 2 and just about most FPS games, you might love this one. A class-based FPS with RPG elements and over 20 million guns to collect and use."
13416,"Starts off a bit slow, but it offers a great mix of First Person Shooter and RPG. The core aspect is FPS, with tons of weapons, armor, talent trees, and classes. It also takes a unique twist with it's cell shaded environment and crude humor gameplay. It's an amazing game to play with friends, and still fun to play alone. If you can get past the first few hours of the game's slow start up, you'll have easily another 30 hours of gameplay in it, even more with friends. Buy the GOTY pack for 7.50$ on a Steam Sale for the best price. The DLC adds a good 10-20 hours onto the game."
13417,Lots of content...unique graphics and fun gameplay! Must have!
13418,"The best FPS-RPG i've ever played, the gun's generation mecanics are just awesome and allow you to farm the lands of pandora to get better and better weapons.Its nerveous fights, beautiful lanscape and uniques protagonists make it a unforgettable experience."
13419,"It's a really fun fun fps rpg kinda game, fun even after beating it a third time :D"
13420,"A great game, even years after its release.  I never was that great at first person shooters until I played this one.  The RPG-like leveling system makes it easy for a person who is new to FPSs feel at home here.  The monsters can get repetitive after a while but each boss is at least different and challenging.  Multiplayer on this game is awesome, and should be utilized at every opportunity!"
13421,"Super long game with loads of guns, nice DLC's and funny/gore cutscenes."
13422,"Ive beaten it 3 different times and still love it. PICK IT UP NOW!!!

I also highly reccommend the DLC, its very expansive and very fun."
13423,"This game is pure fun. It's all about the explosions and the loot; so if you are looking for deep characters or plot, look elsewhere, but if you want running and gunning then pick up this title. It won't disappoint."
13424,"Looks like a comic book, plays like a Bethesda game.  Very interesting story-line."
13425,"One of the best multiplayer games ever, cannot wait till 2."
13426,One of my faves.  There's great fun in destroying raider scumbags and hostile creatures. Infinite different weapons stat combinations similar Diablo/Diablo2. The comic book art style is joyous.
13427,super fun FPS. I recommend playing it with 1 to 3 buddies!
13428,"So many enemies. So many guns. So many cramped hands. 
Unleash your inner MERC with the greatest FPS that DOESN'T involve hats!"
13429,this game is good.. i mean like really good.. hey everybody! come look how good this game is! :DD
13430,"Lots of enemies, loot, hours of fun!"
13431,One of my all-time favourite FPS games. It's got a great world with awesome characters and makes an amazing integration of RPG advancement. Multiplayer action kicks ass and the comedy is absolutely great in it's wacky and twisted ways.
13432,"fun game, definately a different style in terms of grpahics which i certainly do like,sometimes i feel as i have been dying too much though, maybe it's just me but the difficulty level in some areas are a bit too high, unless you have a high leveled character. All in all a great game, not much to flaw really except from that little annoyance, haha 9/10"
13433,I wish someone would have been able to convince me of this game's awesomeness when it was newer. I'm not into FPS's but this one has enough style and leveling to hold my attention like few games have.

13438,"MUST-BUY for any co-op games lover. Great co-op warfare, character level-up and tons of guns!

BEST USED WITH: a friend, and a microphone!"
13439,CATCH A RIDE WITH THE SCOOTER MAAAAAAN!
13440,Giant time/ vampiric life sink that made me a shut-in/pariah. Anyways what i'm saying is that this is a good game.
13441,Cool game))!
13442,You kill crazy MONSTERS!
13443,so many guns
13444,Mooooore!
13445,Diablo with guns.  And the art style is simply amazing.  THe graphics are great but the way things look is great.  I just cant get enough of this game.  New and interesting GUNS GUNS GUNS!!!!
13446,"I cannot recommend this masterpiece enough. The awesome feel and art style are captured and kept throughout the whole game - without detracting from the RPG/FPS gameplay. Loot keeps the game interesting, with over TEN MILLION WEAPONS AND ARMOUR COMBINATIONS. The storyline lacks somewhat, but each character feels unique enough anyway. It looks very good, and runs well on a reasonable PC. There's enough content (especially with all DLC) to keep you occupied for hours, and the incredibly simple to set up multiplayer is a great thing to do with friends."

13451,"An alright game, made much better by coop. Stick around the same levels as the people your playing coop with, otherwise the boring, unimmersive numbers and stats behind the game start to show. It's fun while its a challenge to scamble to find a better gun, and the enemies are tough enough that they require teamwork to beat. Modding makes the majority of it too easy, and like going through the motions, so try not to play with the ridiculously higher leveled players with the obviously modded guns. The core game is good, but the DLCs are actually much more memorable, and better experiences. Dialogue is nice and memorable, or maybe that's just Scooter; ""This is where the cars live! Get you one!""

If you like FPSs, and / or RPGs then you'll like this. I'd say leveling and the progressively better gear / artificially stronger enemies in a FPS never really feels right, but this is what it has, and while it's not great for it - it still manages to be a pretty fun experience."
13452,"GUNS, GUNS, GUNS"
13453,"Like shooting and looting? If so, you'll love Borderlands."
13454,"This is a game that I feel is heavily inspired by Fallout 3, but not nearly as good.

The game world seems fairly big, consisting of smaller areas which are unlocked as you progress. I would have liked more freedom. The ability to drive vehicles is interesting.

The atmosphere is original. I feel, however, that the scenery and soundtrack is a bit limited. Don't expect to get attached to any NPCs. The one I thought was most interesting met his demise relatively early. Their vocals are also very limited; some of them only have a single line reply and no character whatsoever.

Many doors cannot be opened. Secret stashes are restored each time you play, and items are randomly generated, making them less special.

The combat system is fair, but it could have been a bit more interesting. The same applies to the quests, which has very little variety and story. Progress feels like a typical RPG grind most of the time.

I have yet to try co-op mode."
13455,"Midgets with axes, what more convincing do you need?"
13456,"基本的には酔いゲー。fovが狭く、酔いメンには耐えられない。iniをいじれば多少改善できるが、トリッキーな方法でしかfov変更ができないため基本的にはゲロを吐きながらプレイすることになる。

というわけで超絶酔いメンである私ですが、このゲームはゲロ吐きながらクリアまで行ってしまいました。FPS+RPGというジャンルが珍しいこともさることながら、グラフィックスやら何やらおおよそ言葉で表現できる物は一通りよくできていて強い魅力があります。
ゲロを越えたなにかが、ここにはある！

しかしプレイ時間を見ると10時間そこそこくらいしかプレイしていないみたいで不思議ですね。クリアはしたはずなんですが。あとゲロ吐くのでもうこれ以上遊びたくありません。"
13457,So addictive! Can't wait for Borderlands 2!
13458,"FPS RPG  big world, look for guns so you can kill faster 10/10"
13459,"This is one of the best games I've ever had the pleasure of playing.  The gun Veriety is unmatched (I have over 200 Hours logged and I have never found the exact same weapon besides for Quest Reward uniques).  The Quests are fun and have some great references.  Where this game really shines is in the Multiplayer, it is amazing to play the game on your own but throw in 2 or 3 friends and let the fun begin!  The only flaw in Multiplayer is that the servers are hosted by Gamespy.

Overall this is a Must have game for anyone and everyone, and you can get the GOTY edition which has all 4 awesome DLCs for $29.99!"
13460,"Simply put, Diablo with guns. And no useless, annoying DRMs or Auction Houses. Play it with a friend. Or two. Or three. All with mics. This here is co-op games' heaven."
13461,"Loving this game again it never seems to get old. Fun seems to be had by all that play this one i know me and the guys that play with me have good fun time and time again. hopefully the NEW version   of this tobe released soon can improve on this and take us to the next level. 

If you havent played this one get it get it now and play the ass off of it you will not regret it infact you will have mad fun sooooo many differant guns to play with :D sooooo many baddies to shoot a funny / entertaining story plenty of levels and lots of large DLC mission packs you definatly get your $ worth out of this one
"
13462,"It's an interesting game.  It starts out slow, but as you advance beyond some of the starter missions and get into the second area, the action picks up quite a bit.  The basic idea is that you are a 'Vault Hunter' of one of four 'Classes'.  You gain levels, gain skills that manipulate your classes' main ability, and wind up dealing with a boatload of weapons, which is a good or bad thing, depending on how much time you enjoy looting/dealing with items.  

Storywise, the game is lack-luster and the end, while not entirely predictable, had very little impact.   Great if you like the action, not very great if you're deep on story.   Multiplayer really intensifies things as you gain the ability to synergize with your friends while simultaneously fighting significantly stronger enemies.

Overall, good game when cheap."
13463,EPIC!!!
13464,"Quality gameplay, excellent pacing, good story, and its humorous to boot.  I recommend getting the game of the year edition though...  Whereas I am not always a fan of DLC I find for this game it is worth it."
13465,Extraordinary unique great game.
13466,Fun looting with friends!
13467,"This is an amazing game, you should buy it instantly if you're into RPG's and/or first person shooters. This game has over 17,750,000 gun possibilities making each gun you find unique. It has 4 classes each with unique abilities and different skill trees. The bosses and mini bosses are fun to fight and once you beat the game you get to do playtrough 2 with your same character,same guns and same skills but the game becomes even harder. 15/10 this is an epic game."
13468,The lewt is phatt indeed.
13469,Dont play alone.
13470,Jacktackular game that does a great job of blending FPS and RPG game types. Can't stop looking for loot....
13471,"Borderlands is possibly one of the best games I have ever played.  The story line(s) are fantastic, the gun possibilites are endless and satisfying (if you want, you can have a machine pistol that spurs acid on your enemy along with regular bullet damage!), the graphics are pretty nice, and, altough it's a dark and depressing world, can be hilarious at times (like Claptrap!)  Even your charcter has certain skills and actions to do (spawn a turret, go in another direction, etc) and can be upgraded.  Again, one of the best games I have played to date, and can't WAIT for the sequel!"
13472,"nice comic look, crazy story and setting, thats what it makes worth to play :D"
13473,awesome
13474,fun as fawk
13475,Awesome Game and great fun!!!
13476,"Its like u with 3 of ur friends going out having an advanture...THIS GAME IS BADASS
One of the game tht I looking for all the time..Play co-op, do mission together travelling, find better weapons/gears.....SO MUCH FUN!!  Fight with variety type of enemy. Every charactor have their own uniqe skill tht will help friend and urself during the fight. If u play it chapter by chapter follow the right step be patient for level up pogress....The supreme satisfaction is waiting for U. Love alot except a bit lack of reality such as  enemy reaction and car driving....hope Borderland 2 fixed all this.Must OWN

85% lets go mate"
13477,"Жаль, что  тут нет русской версии. Пришлось проходить со сторонним русификатором и  поэтому из сюжета понял не особо много. Но это не испортило впечатления от игры. Очень бодро играется Похожа на помесь дьябло и квейка. Всем настоятельно рекомендую. Очень понраевилась."

13484,Geil :)
13485,Really fun open world shoot-em-up game! Multiplayer too!
13486,"An absolutely fantastic game.  Take an RPG levelling and skill system, add a dash of Diablo-inspired randomised loot, then put it all into a wasteland FPS.  Hmm... needs a pinch of humour.

While Borderlands may not have the strongest story going around, the wacky characters and bazillions of guns mesh with addictive and enjoyab le gameplay to result in a top-class product."
13487,Whee
13488,"If you like FPS and looting stuff, then this is a wonderful mix of the two. Run through missions and things in a barren landscape with weapons of your choosing, killing everything you see and taking anything you find. Lots of weapons, each one nearly unique with attributes, plus lots of stuff to do equals good fun. ^_^ Go try this game. Do note some of its humour isn't for the kids. But I love the nigh-maniacal laughter from my character after slaughtering a bunch of skags..."
13489,A Game
13490,play it with a friend
13491,"Easily the best FPS I've ever played. The RPG elements work beautifully. The DLC really shines as being worthwhile and fun, expanding the game to the point where 100+ hours of joy can easily be had. All the characters are fun and hilarious in their own ways and the planet of Pandora is well characterized. This game is an INSANE amount of fun."
13492,Bardzo fajny fps rpg!
13493,Don't fuck with Nine-Toes. He has 3 balls.
13494,Entertaining and captivating in a very special setting.
13495,"Buy this. You'll never experience more joy. And if you play this and feel no joy, you are probably ginger and have no soul."
13496,"It's an alright port and a good game. If your fond of dungeon crawling, looting, and FPS's then you may like this. Story wise it kinda lacks on core game but the DLC nailed it beautifully . Then again the dialouge alone is a good selling point."
13497,"An amazingly good first person shooter with an RPG vibe, long and detailed with plenty of stuff to do and plenty of weapons to pick (though you'll probably just sell most of them!)"

13504,80 bazillion guns. No one needs that many guns.
13505,"憋了很久，终于还是忍不住在2代发售之前，把DLC给收了，再次进入荒蛮世界。
Borderlands是一款虽然说起来有点老掉牙，当你不玩的时候你可以滔滔不绝的说出游戏的众多缺点，但是一旦玩起来却很难停的下来的游戏。两年了，游戏的魅力依然，前两天当我再次下载完成，进入游戏后发现，依然很容易让人沉迷其中，虽然几乎对每一个任务都很熟悉，但就是欲罢不能。什么是好游戏，我想不是81分的分数可以说明清楚的。
在等待续作发售的这段时间里，重温本作真的是不错的选择。"

13512,Well worth the money.
13513,"This is a wonderful game and fully worth playing X}

Loot hoarders beware, this game just might want to make you go nutters.

a FPS that was untold amounts of fun with co-op.

exception, avoid Moxi arena DLC (Not worth completing in the slightest)

Works wonderfully with KB&M"

13515,"This is Captain Hollister from the lunar destroyer Rook, we recieved a distress call from the planet Pandora. As we entered the planets orbit we were ambushed by a battalion of ships from Crimson Lance Mercs'. They fired on us without warning by the time we brought weapons online they had fighters swarming all over us we tried to retreat but there were just too many. We've lost shields and life support, we have mutliple hull breaches all over. Engines are not responding, I've ordered all crew to abandon ship. The ship is already re-entering the atmosphere. Fucking hell is that a battlecruiser?! It's firing on us, we're breaking apart. This is captain Hollister to anyone who can hear this. Do not follow the distress signals, stay away from 
Pando - Signal Lost"
13516,"I bought this game on a whim because it was on sale. I must say, this is probably one of my all time favorite FPS games after the Half Life series. It's like Diablo with guns. Lots of loot, and the replayability factor is excellent. Can't wait for the sequel to come out in September. 
"
13517,"good game 
"
13518,this game is GREAT on singleplayer and AMAZING with 4 players
13519,Fight with your friends over who gets the best gun.
13520,"Not recommended for players that suffer from motion sickness caused from low FoV levels, reason being that there is no FoV slider. (The only way of changing your FoV is to bind a key to repeatedly go into a different FoV degree as something as simple as sprinting or aiming will revert it to default) Otherwise, though, having played it on console, it's far more fun on PC. The ability to actually aim in particular helps a lot."
13521,"It's like Diablo but with guns. 
....It's like PSO but with ONLY guns, lol.
Pretty good game, and I hate shooters. c:"

13534,"This game is the most fun I've had on a fps in a while. Its like fallout had sex with call of duty to create a world of fun. You gather ammo, can purchase guns and health kits and stuff and travel like 10 different areas of quests. 8.5/10"

13554,Cool game!
13555,Just bought the GOTY edition. So far the game is insanely fun c:. I recommend this game to anyone who loves shooters and RPG games. Plus the graphics are amazing.
13556,"This game is the craziest game for ever =)
"
13557,"Borderlands is fun, the loot reminds me of Diablo, with lots of random variety, but the game plays like a FPS with some RPG elements. Bonus points for being different enough from 99% of the FPS's on the market. *Lots* more action than Fallout 3 / NV.

The default Field of View is only 70 degrees, it's ok if you're sitting a yard away from the TV (like with a console), but it sucks if you're using a PC monitor. I'd strongly recommend googling ""Borderlands fov fix"", and setting your FOV to about 100, it stops the game feeling like you have zoom permanently on.

During the Steam summer sale and the Borderlands sale a week later, Borderlands and Borderlands GOTY edition (with all the DLC) were the same price, so be sure to check if you can get all the DLC for free. If they aren't the same price, I wouldn't bother with the DLC."
13558,"A classic game that features RPG Elements and fast paced action.

Also shared loot, so you can steal from your friends."
13559,"Großartige Coop Action.
Die 4,50 EUR für die GOTY Edition allemal Wert."
13560,Sweet game it's fucking amazing. Buy it while you can.
13561,"Pandora, a world full of bandits, mayhem, and thousands upon thousands of different guns that you can use the rip apart any resistance you encounter as you make your way to the mysterious Vault in hopes of unlocking it's alien treasure. Play solo or in up to a four member team on an adventure that will chance the way you look at FPS games with light and asscessable RPG elements. With a vast and exciting main story and the addition of three stunning DLCs packed with adrenaline fuled action, you would be a fool not to become a Vault Hunter yourself."
13562,"4 player co-op mayham, lootable stuff and RPG aspect in a FPS game. What more can one wish for?
Well perhaps a bit less reppetition, I suppose. Gets a bit boring if you play it alone, without the multiplayer element."
13563,"It's a fun FPS with procedurally-generated weapons and RPG elements.  FPS-Diablo hybrid that works.  Despite the lack of Steamworks multiplayer (GameSpy, lol), it is more challenging and that much more fun with friends.
It's the best kind of ridiculous game: a ridiculous game that knows it's a ridiculous game and just wants to show you how ridiculous it is."
13564,"Очень веселая игрушка, особенно в кооперативе!"
13565,"Not sure why, but this somehow became one of my all-time favorites.  Perfect combination of humor, setting and extreme violence."

13577,great
13578,"I was gifted this game from the summer sale :) and i cant put it down!!.So many quests and things to do even in single player mode :) Just keep on the look out for the $4.99 for Reg and $7.99 for the Game Of The Year edition .Its a steal at that price for a dam kool and good game.At that price you too will be saying ""HEY LOOK AT ME IM DANCING IM DANCING!!!"" lol"

13592,Addictive questing along with an incredible mix of guns makes this game too much fun.
13593,A classic!
13594,"Real ace game, great for people who love class based games"
13595,"A great loot and shoot game. The weapon variety can seem infinite. I don't think I picked up the same gun throughout my 30 hr playthrough. Storage does become a problem without the DLC. Enemies come in all shapes, sizes, and species. The AI is fairly easy to exploit at times which is a con. Quests are pretty standard but are usually presented in a way that makes it feel different. The world itself is huge and makes me want to do a second and third playthrough to see all the character classes and specialized abilities. The story is lacking though and it's easy to lose track of the details. Excited for the sequel."
13596,Addictive as hell!
13597,It shows a guy shooting himself in the head. How can you not like it.
13598,Best!
13599,Best Mexican drug cartel game I've played.
13600,Why are you reading this and not playing Borderlands?!
13601,"Borderlands. what can you say about it other than GUNS, GUNS EVERYWHERE.

mildly interesting story, lots of guns. funny enemies, rewarding loot system.

story begins with some random on a bus being contacted by some random glowy woman. (dont know why you would listen to this stranger. let alone a stranger in your own head)  and shortly after that there is a robot that is (depending on who you talk to) either queer, or the best thing ever.

the main story is a bit bad (final boss, case in point) but the four DLCs fix this through longer stories, more enemies and more GUNS."
13602,love it love it cant wait for borderlands 2
13603,"Great 4 player Co-op with different classes and perks!
Cant wait for Borderlands 2 and kick some ass."
13604,"Borderlands breaks up everything you know about game genres! An, from  outside standing view, absurd combination of the RPG, FPS, and Adventure genres which in many ears was doomed to fail, actually turns out to be an epic mix that you might consider purchasing!

FPS and RPG games had a baby, and it's called BORDERLANDS!"
13605,Get lost in the world of Borderlands.  A whole lot of game and well worth it.  Does anyone not have this yet here?
13606,"Bang, bang, loot. ""Claptrap"" may sound like an sexually transmitted disease but in this game you'll look forward to catching it."
13607,Great game. Passed it 9-10 times and want to play it MORE AND MORE. Great replay value and fun with friends :D
13608,awesome
13609,Find three friends and let the fun begin

13612,"This is probably one of the most fun games you will ever play

EDIT: Almost 4 years later.......

The first Borderlands I think is still the best out of the Borderlands series/ Why?
I first played this with my brother when I was only 12 years old, and him and I shared his account just so we can play this together. -One online and one offline, thus allowing a LAN server. This was possible in 2010 because Borderlands ran on Gamespy servers, and not steam servers. 

Got into the original Borderlands again because the Pre-Sequal is just a cash grabber. The second installment of Borderlands is fun, but it's just missing some side missions, I.e. In Borderlajds 2 there isn't a side mission where you have to help a charater, such as Cl4p-, give the character something they need. When you give that item or objective to that character you get loot.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would reconmend this game for anyone who loves RPGs or First Person Shooters. 

*If you like Destiny then please play Borderlands, becauuse Borderlands is the ""superior"" game compared to Destiny. Eventhough the pre-Sequal was the worst borderlands game, it's still more fun than Destiny. Destiny requires you to have people play with you, and those people have to be on your friends list."
13613,"Great mix of FPS and RPG.  Played it on the PS3 first, and the computer version is even better due to mouse aiming.  Only questionable thing about it is that the graphics are really blocky on the PC.  Trying to figure out if that is due to my settings, or that the PS3 just has better graphics on this one."
13614,"A once great Neo said: ""We're going to need guns, Lots of guns"" and 2K replied with 3 Bazillion weapons, is this enough for you Neo."

Literally huge area. GTA4 maps seem puny in comparision.
Awesome graphics.
17 million(!) weapons.
Not another game with only 6 hour gameplay.
Did I mention it has an excellent co-op feature?

9.5 out of 10 from me.
Why not 10? Two drawbacks:
1. No minimap (there is a map though)
2. Gamespy."

13622,If you get this game with all the DLC you'll have a ton of content to go through before you put it down again. The looting can get annoying but the game is overall fun to play with friends and it looks great.
13623,"Despite at times being keyboard-smashingly frustrating, it's always great fun and wonderfully absurd."
13624,Uno dei migliori giochi degli ultimi anni e questo in particolare è in assoluto il migliore della serie!
13625,"Great game, many guns. use willowtree to avoid gameplay at all!"
13626,Definitely a time killer. Best played with friends.
13627,"Everyone and their dog on steam has this game, If you don't you then you must feel out of the loop and a result buy it anyway.

I'm not even going to say a opinion about this game I’m just going to let peer pressure do the work.
"
13628,There will be no refund! Your refund will be escaping this death trap with your life!
13629,"всем рекомендую поиграть )) немного напоминает фаллаут, и графика оч пикольная ))"
13630,"This is a fusion of a FPS and a RPG, resulting in one of the most fun experiences you'll have in a while, the game has nice re-playability and the DLC to it adds at least an addtional 30+ hours to it. Overall a great game, i'll probably get the second one as well."
13631,"Guns, Guns, Guns, Guns, Guns, Guns, and more Guns. This game has over 87 bazillion guns and they are all so fun to turn people into paste. If you are looking for a game with a solid storyline that doesn't take itself to seriously, this is the gme for you. Wtih comedic elements throughout the game and 4 unique classes and hundreds of playstiles to choose from this game has anyhing and everything a fan of either MMO's or FPS's love. GET EEET NAO!"
13632,An oldie but goodie. Cell shaded FPS fun
13633,sugar tits
13634,Awesome co-op feature.
13635,Awesome Game!
13636,"Fun for a bit but gets boring fast. Same boring locations, boring missions, story is hardly there. But does have aamazing loot system. If you want to get into the Borderlands games then just pick up Borderlands 2 instead, it's much better in everyway."
13637,"...GOTY, this is a must have shooter/rpg."
13638,HUE
13639,One of the best games ever.
13640,"Except for the fact that the endgame, the whole thing the game revolves around, is sort of a Skyrim-esque anticlimax it's a good one. The graphic style and setting are among the best, while the co-op feature has yet to fail on delivery. DLC-wise the game is very strong and should be picked up."
13641,Amazing game with great content and amazing DLC.
13642,"Tons of guns, large open world at a crazy multiplayer mode"
13643,One of the best game i played. Funny and entertaining.
13644,"one of the best FPS of this generation of games 

is FPS+ Loot RPG and with really cool art  and funny pop  jokes mostly from games"
13645,"This game is a time bandit. You'll get so caught in playing it you will lose track of time, hours will pass without you noticing. Friends and loved ones may even come looking for you, which is ok because this game has four player co-op, so let them in on the fun! All-in-all a great game, can't wait for the sequel."
13646,Fun.. Loads of Guns.. Co-op.. interesting battles.. level up.. Really enjoyable!
13647,Haven't played it yet. Better than Diablo 3
13648,"Tons of fun, something you should always play with the most people you can making a job out of it. Amazing script by 2K the art and gameplay very memorable. All the DLC's were worth the purchase cannot wait for the polished* second installment.

*After replaying is serveral times, there are many things that can be fix. 
Only the host can track quests, unable to use inventory or map within vehicals. A handful of clipping error and needless back tracking in quests. Unable to view more than on quest at a time. Those are what I remember as of typing this, I hope these issues are revised. 
"
13649,Nice game!
13650,!!!
13651,great game A+++++
13652,"Its Great
"
13653,Great RPG with solid game and gun play
13654,"Great beginning to the story and genre, unfortunately its ugly to look at but it old. must play to understand where it all began."
13655,"I like this game, especialy when playing co-op with friends!11"
13656,Do I really to tell you about Borderlands?
13657,"I bought this game retail when it first came out, with its stupid DRM then lost the disc before I was half way through it.  Gutted.  Steam Summer sale came along and I impulsively got it again for a fiver!"
13658,it's good because it has modern colors and you shoot people
13659,"I'm pretty sure you don't need my advice to know to buy this game, but holy shit it's some of the most fun I've ever had loot grinding."
13660,a good rpg
13661,Good single player. Better co-op.
13662,Exelent jeu
13663,"really good game.
"
13664,Great game to spend hundreds of hours playing
13665,"Tons of loot and headshots, what more du you want? This is massive fun and I can't wait for the sequel."
13666,"If you don't already own this game, you must be the kid who glued their ear to their shoulder in kindergarten."
13667,Объединяет все лучшие черты экшена и рпг  + необычная графика и неплохой сюжет
13668,Jogo sensacional
13669,"Not a great game to play solo, but with friends, it's a blast.  Set up a LAN or play it online, either way it's a ton of fun.  The cell shading graphics are beautiful to look at, and the insane diversity of weapons make it worth picking things up.  The skill levelling gives it a little  more customizability.  All of which add up to a very fun game."
13670,"So this is basically Dungeon Siege only as an FPS, and I would recommend it on that basis with the following caveats: it's crashed on me four times in six hours' play, the first chunk of it can be quite dull (god, do I have to re-kill all these skags *every fucking time*? ... yes, apparently yes I do), and some of the battles are unbalanced for single-player, requiring you to just spam the boss with your own repeated respawning until he dies. Other than that, it's good fun. But those issues make it kinda repetitive, and it only activates that grinding / churning mechanism for me; the story doesn't stick and the things you do are all kinda dull."
13671,"part fps, part rpg, sounds like it would be the worst of both but it's far from it, definately worth picking up."
13672,Best when played with a group of friends.
13673,"One of my favorite games of all time :)
"
13674,"You can't go wrong with Borderlands. Tons of stuff to kill, skills to level, and loot for days. Great to play with friends, it is a must have."
13675,"In nerdy terms, it's pretty hopeless. The bosses are a pushover, the guns are all over the place; some useless, others ridiculously powerful. It's a team coop game, but you have to stick with the same team all the way through, thanks to the rubbish levelling system and mission flags. Baddies are initially rather difficult because you have terrible weapons, no ammo and no money.  Pick a fight with a pig and you are likely to die. Initially gameplay tends to be very frustrating because you can run out of ammo half way through a mission then have to go back to get ammo and literally start again. Later the opposite happens that missions are just too easy. In addition, towards the end of the game some gun types become pretty useless while others become insanely powerful. Oddly it was even worse in Borderlands 2 where they messed up the entire balance of the game with The Bee. Bazzillions of guns and with one badly thought out shield they effectively forced people down one or two upgrade paths.  
The game runs very well on a modern PC well, abeit it does take a little while to sort out things like FOV and V-Sync. It looks and plays amazing for it's age. 
With all the problems, it's no wonder that Borderlands didn't get rave reviews, but despite all that, it's an absolute classic. One of the best shooters ever made. The graphics and music build an atmosphere that's highly addictive and if that's not enough to get you hooked then the looting system and tons of options in the gear system surely will. Buy it. It's better than Borderlands 2 as well, albeit 2 is more refined, 1 is more atmospheric.
Oh, and get the Game Of The Year too, because the DLC are great. The Underdome is so much fun it’s absolute must have. Just make sure you play them in the right order and don't visit the DLC until it's time to play it

Borderlands
The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned 
Mad Moxxi's Underdome
The Secrety Armory of General Knoxx
Claptrap's New Robot Revolution

I have to say that I didn't like Claptrap's New Robot Revolution but this is largely becuase I just found him annoying, lol. I guess that's just personal choice though, the rest of the DLC Is great."
13676,If you've got a few friends to play with you'll blow through this. Hours of great play and plenty of laughs. Grab the GOTY Edition with all the DLC it's well worth the money!
13677,"It's got a really cool aesthetic, and does for guns what Diablo did for sharp things, but do NOT get it for SOLO play. Gearbox has never been good at bosses, and these ones in particular are frustrating bullet sponges that are clearly designed for a team to tackle. Besides, you'll spend much less time frigging with cover when there are friends around."
13678,broderands
13679,Really awesome! A perfect CO-OP Rpg!
13680,cool game
13681,"FPS meets RPG.
Good fusion of  the two genres, with level progression, talent trees and random loot generation and quests. Single or multi player.
And all the FPSy goodness of 'sploding heads with critical hits.
:D"
13682,"yeeeess

for single player this i liked this better than borderlands 2"
13683,A great game to play online with friends
13684,Supa fun
13685,"FPS, aRPG, Co-op, AWESOME.

The latter is the best description to this game.

A perfect combination of Perk-based aRPG and Shooter (sans the aim twitching that a lot of shooters require, which makes this game far more ""approachable"") put in a blender with less than relevant NPCs, shallow and non-intrusive story and freaky enemies trying to skin your face to wear as a mask, added with some gore and ten tons of blood. That's Borderlands for you.

And it's multiplayer mode is the best thing since sliced bread, to the point that some people claim this is one of those games that can't be fully enjoyed by yourself, playing solo. Well I say these people should be hung in a rope of Skag guts and left to rot under the scorching sun of Pandora, then respawned at a New-U station and beat to death with a Midget Psycho's arm - only to be revived yet another time and thrown again into the pit-fight/rat-race madness that is the planet's looming backdrop. Alone or with friends, this game is awesome."
13686,"I didn't know what to expect going in. Many people were saying ""Diablo with guns"" and the Diablo series has never really been my thing. I'm glad to say that Borderlands is not ""Diablo with guns"" what it is is an incredibly fun open-world (mostly) shooter. 

It has a few annoying qualities: guns aren't particularly differentiated within a class, and the random element of mods means you likely won't be upgrading your weapons incredibly quickly. There's also an annoying damage scaling that uses the difference between your character's and enemy's levels to determine how much damage is done. Those two detractions were not enough to put this game down. It's easily one of the most enjoyable, over-the-top shooters in recent memory.

Well worth the money."
13687,Fun co-op game. Less so alone.
13688,"Addictive. Good gameplay, equipment with random effects Diablo style and online co-op and very interesting graphics. It's one of those games that can really suck you in. Has some issues at first but nothing that a good tweaking can't fix."
13689,THIS GAME RULES ITS JUST CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13690,This is a game to get if you wanna have a great time with your friends. I would totally tell everyone i knew to get it
13691,"Cool visual style, tons to do and fun as hell with a couple 'o mates. Bought it when it was on sale with all the DLC packs; totally worth it!"
13692,get it :o
13693,ALL THE GUNS!
13694,nice game
13695,할만 하던데?
13696,Borderlands 2!
13697,Really fun game to play with a friend or a few.
13698,"Seriously, get this game.
Do it.
Get all the DLC too.
DO IT YOU BABBY."
13699,"Good game, well made. Allows you to pick your own playing style and use it to the best of its abilities, with four base classes to choose from and all that other regular gubbins you always find. Leveling, stat improving, a whole host of weapons to choose from and a large open landscape to explore with something hiding behind every corner. The only problem I have with this game is the difficulty curve, which had me fighting bosses way above my level rather early on in the storyline - though this may only be my stubborness and refusal to stray from the sandy wastelands I learned to call ""home"". An immersive story is trumped by the fantastic gameplay, helped by the distinctive art style that makes Borderlands so damn good. Single player and co-op too. If you haven't already, buy it :D"
13700,great co-op fun
13701,great game to play with friends. i recomend it and suggest you check out the sequel thats coming out.
13702,"One of the best games I've played! Fun graphics, tons of replayability and an everlasting search for better loot!"
13703,"Wicked game, worth playing !"
13704,great game! bit repetitive on the missions but still fun to play!
13705,Insanity!
13706,"A FPS with lots of humor in it. The cell shading gives it a very different feel than most shooters who try to make it as lifelike as possible. As you progress through the game, the scenery changes which is always nice, and the enemies begin to evolve from killing dog like creatures to humanoids who have full shields that they hide behind. Worth every penny spent for the GoTY edition."
13707,"Great game, Most fun with friends so it's suggested you play with them."
13708,"My Favourite RPG/FPS for sure, the story is hilarious....."
13709,"Thise game surprised me. i didnt think i'd like it origionaly but the quirky cartoonish style an humor drew me in. Ther is plenty of missions an areas to keep you and your friends ocupied for hours, especialy if you get the DLC. However the game is a bit repedative, being that you mainly just run around shooting things and most of the story is told through text. The biggest problem with thise game however is that its multiplayer system is poorly implimented and for a purely co-op game thats a fatel flaw. some friends i've been able to conect to there games or vise versa some what reliably, others however it seems to be imposible for us to connect."
13710,Quite possibly the most fun ive ever had playing a video game with someone was this game. Just complete and utter joy.
13711,"Divertido e desafiador (na maioria das vezes). 
:-)"
13712,"This game deserves all the praise it's given. Despite the story-telling being a bit slim, this is without a doubt one of the best Diablo 2 style loot grinders. Very addictive gameplay and it becomes even more amazing with friends."
13713,Awesome!
13714,Игра однословно шедевр!
13715,"Borderlands is a cartoony, item-fest fps! And oh so awesome! Make sure to get the DLC as they are cheap and add a lot to the game, especially Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot which is fun, pretty difficult, and has awesome trippy music."
13716,"En terminos cortos, nos encontramos ante un juego tipo Doom, es decir un FPS (First Person Shooter), en el que veremos el arma que llevamos y lo que puede ver nuestro personaje. Pero Borderlands es mucho mas que eso. Además cuenta con unos pocos toques de rol, lo suficiente para que sus creadores, Gearbox, lo hayan denominado como ""rol de acción"". Primero deberemos elegir al personaje con el que queremos comenzar la aventura, cada uno con proficiencia en distintas armas (aqnque se podrán usar todas) y distintas habilidades, y es que con cada nivel subiremos un punto de habilidad que deberemos elegir entre tres ramas (no se excluyen) y elegir entre dos habilidades para rellenar alguna y poder pasar a la siguiente.

Por X-Chema.

13718,"4 unique classes, tons of quests, variety of guns, awesome co-op, make this a near perfect game. combine diablo loot system, saints rows humor, fallouts universe, elderscrolls quests and you get this game"
13719,Classic Fun
13720,"It's like WoW and Battlefield got drunk one night, and one thing led to another.."
13721,"feels pretty dated now but still way less glitchy than the ""enhanced"" version"
13722,"Extremely good, thinking of play it more after months of having finished it"
13723,Well worth it! I have lost track of how many times I have played through this game.
13724,"OMG det spil er det bedste i verden / OMG this game is the best in the world
"
13725,"No reason not to pick up Borderlands, with friends it's a riot!"
13726,Love it. Can't wait for the second one to come out.
13727,"Not a fan of RPG genre, but this is one can easily compete with Titan Quest as one of very few RPG games I like. This is also one and only Borderlands game that I would play. I love Lilith too much to try any other. Totally recommend it."
13728,Awesome game! awesome art-style... Awesome everything :D
13729,"Put off buying it for a long time, not sure why. This game is as awesome as everyone says it is. I definitely recommend it."
13730,A game you should not miss. Waiting for the sequel...
13731,"Definitely my favorite game this gen! Awesome artistic design, plenty of guns and a few tough challenges :)"
13732,Love it
13733,Great for playing together!
13734,Absolutely fantastic from start to end
13735,uhu ! :)
13736,"When you combine a classic shooter and a roleplaying game, what do you get?
Answer is: you get Borderlands!"
13737,"Uns dos melhores jogos rpg/fps que já joguei, mas nao é melhor que o fallout new vegas :D
Vamos ver como fica o borderlands 2"
13738,"""No, no, no, no, Derrick, it was your day to have the access code. I'm on personal ice cream leave of absence; code 3 dot 5 dot 31 in the manual clearly states--""

(GOTY/All DLCs required)"
13739,"The cell-shading makes the game look awesome. It'd be very plain without it. At least a Gazillion guns, and pretty funny dialouge. The Game of the Year edition is the same cost as the normal version, and the DLC is hilarious and awesome. Highly recommended."
13740,Hack. Slash. Hack hack slash.
13741,Great co-op game!
13742,"Role-playing FPS? Sure, why not? But seriously, this game is fun, colorful, (art looks good) and rude! Play it!"
13743,BUY THIS GAME
13744,"gud game
"
13745,Best game ever
13746,"Good immersion, awesome villians, and decent music.
"
13747,"Borderlands Gooood

13748,Great game to play with a group. There are public games so u don't have to be alone but great with friends. Still pretty fun by yourself too.
13749,"cool game, but its gonna suck when 2 comes out. just sayin'"
13750,How can you go wrong with this title.  It is a 4 player FPS MMO.  Hours of enjoyment with your friends and plenty of great DLC if you need more Pandora.
13751,"Pretty fun and Sometimes funny game that can either make ya smile or curse.lol, i got this from a dear friend, do the favor n do the same!"
13752,Realistic?  Hell no.  Fun?  Absolutely.  With more guns than the Arab Spring!
13753,YES
13754,gud co op
13755,
13756,Wish I got this game sooner.
13757,"It's a pretty good game. It's sort of a RPG/FPS hybrid. There is a plot and many missions to undertake. There are many variations of guns to choose from. Many of the guns seem the same bass model but there seems to be a dozens of variations for each base weapon. I've only played singled player so far, but I imagine playing co op with up to 3 additional other players would really add to the fun. The graphics are a little funky. Everything looks like an illustration. It's different and you get used to it. Good gameplay over all. It has a good bit of replayability as well. I would give it a good 8.5/10."
13758,The one game I have continuously played over and over more than ME2.
13759,So nice to see somebody actually put CRPG+FPS together and make it work. This game has provided me a few hundred hours of fun and I heartily recommend it to anybody who's a fan of blowing stuff up in a post-apocalyptic setting.
13760,BEST GAME IN DA WORLD!
13761,BOOOOOOOORING
13762,Pretty fun lol
13763,Best Co-Op FPS/RPG I've played in YEARS
13764,"What can you say about Borderlands? 

It's an incredible game, that will guarantee hours of pure fun, especially if played with friends, and after a long time it still manages to keep the charm that attracted players to give it a try in the first place.

This is simply one of best RPG shooters I ever played!

So... give it a try and believe me, that you will not be disappointed. :)"
13765,i havent taken my medicatio nyet today so i'm sorry if this sounds raw and uncut but it is better this way beacuse this game is uncut and raw like i am right now. this game has so many meager perfectional flaws and quasi eccentic cutscenes with deeper-than-seen meanings beneath the surface that i find any comparison comparible moot and unintelligible. play this game and buy it for all your friends so they can experience the great world of pandora with your loved one and close friends and family to play together in the coop realm where all your decisions matter the most
13766,"Bajizilion randomized weapons and equally generated targets to go with them and over abundance of ammunition, what else could you ask for."
13767,A really cool RPG/Shooter. However it is alot more fun in co-op
13768,"The game speaks for itself. I've beaten it more times than I care to remember. When it came onsale over the winter I rebought, i had the base game for PS3, in GOTY ediion and continued to replay and rebeat everything on each character multiple times."
13769,It's just a great game with good style and some pretty sweet art style.  I have played this game on my Ps3 and never thought it would be that much better on the PC.  But it is well over my expectations especially when played with friends...
13770,"Einfach nur Geil
"
13771,"Combines FPS with funny twisted humor & good playability, a huge open-ended world and Diablo-like grinding while searching for the ultimate weaponry. Can recommend also all the DLCs, except for Mad Moxxi's."
13772,Awesome game!! I have bought it 3 times now!!! Can't wait for no. 2!!!
13773,CATCH A RIIIIIIIIIIIDE!!!
13774,"Juegaso, muy vicioso! me pase 8hs el primer dia nada mas jajaja"
13775,"A large open world FPS with RPG elements, loot hunting and fun driving sequences make this a must buy. This game is how Diablo would look like if it were ever reimagined as an FPS.

It features 4 different characters each with their own unique mechanics and style of play. Story is interesting although not mind blowing. Music and Art Direction are quite unique but may be subjective to individual tastes. I like it as it has its own unique look that looks like a graphic novel.

The thing that makes this game really shines is its 4 players Co-op multiplayer. Having 3 other friends fight and level with you on an large open world environment hunting for sweet loot is definitely a fantastic experience.

Downsides, I felt that the whole campaign sometimes just feel like a big laundry list of quests to just do and get over with with no coherent connection between them.

Overall Rating: 8 / 10
Definitely worth full price, and an absolute steal when bought on sale."
13776,This game is brilliant and I love the gameplay so far! :D
13777,Have a plan to kill everyone you meet. And get purplies.
13778,Good game to play with friends.  Look out for the second part this year.
13779,"El cooperativo con mayor de la historia de los videojuegos. Su dropeo de objetos, su humor y sobre todo su desarrollo harán que se te pasen las horas como si fueran minutos, literalmente hablando."
13780,best rpg ever
13781,Borderlands will blow your mind!! Can't wait for the second one.
13782,"I've already finished the game before on my PS3, but when I got this game gifted, I couldn't resist to enjoy the epic experience again. This is on of my favourite games of all time and I can't wait for Borderlands 2."
13783,It's balls to the wall awesome.
13784,"The game starts off with 4 people getting off the bus to hunt for the mythical Vault. The depth of its characters is so so but they are endearing, I wished there was more. The gunplay is not bad, some mechanics depending on the gun can be frustrating at times. The character custumization is lackluster as well, but since this is the first game in the series I would take this with a grain of salt. The paid extra content is really nice, it adds depth to some of games cast. 

I wish there was more lore rich quests, I am not a fan of kill x many of this or go find x many of that. I want more of Pandora and its inhabitants. The variance of enemies in this game is limited to Eridan, Bandits (midgets, brutes and psychoes), Red Lance, and a few animal types. I wish there was more but like I mentioned earlier it is the first in its series. 

All in all it is definitaly worth the cost and is really fun. 

I really wish they would have kept the gore in the future titles, but sadly they did not. 

Happy Gaming, have fun."
13785,Great game if you've never played it. Mix between Diablo and your favorite FPS.
13786,Awesome Game! up to 4 player Co-op!
13787,"After Mass Effect 1 and 2, Borderlands is refreshingly straightforward, though repetitive. The comic book art style is a good choice, setting a distinct mood, which softens the ""crapsack world"" style so that it is less bleak than grimly amusing."
13788,Gun porn.
13789,Very addicting! The variety of weapons/enemies will keep you playing for hours! :D
13790,Very good single or co-op FPS. Loved the graphics and the character types. Excellent weapons and good re-playablility.
13791,"an excellent example of what happens when you mix genre's, and though its been done before, it hasnt been done AS GOOD as this!!! excellent game, must buy! DLC is actually fun and worth it two"
13792,As long as you have some buddies to play with you're ognna have a goddamn blast!
13793,"Borderlands was my first game on steam, and first major PC game. It's a perfect blend of FPS and RPG, and the guns are quite amazing in this game. There are literally billions of different guns, some of which have very unique crazy and entertaining abilities. The multiplayer is lacking due to how easy it is to cheat online, and the fact of bad menu interfaces (which is regrettably present in the whole game). However, playing with your friends can be enjoyable, unless they are loot whores. Borderlands also has quite a bit of humor and references woven into the game and story, which gives it a comic edge over other shooters. One of my most highly recommended games"
13794,Imense fun and Bazilion gunz :)
13795,Best times will be had with this game Play now or regret living
13796,"Just get this, play this, and enjoy shooting the crap out of everything you meet. I can't even say enough about how fun this game is. Yes, there are bugs like crazy bad pathing issues for the vehicles and the retarded respawning of everything you kill. But that's part of what makes it FUN."
13797,I didn't understand the incredibly addictiong nature of the incrementally increasing value of LOOT until this game.
13798,looty.
13799,Very fun multiplayer.
13800,CARTOONFUN
13801,"Tons of replay value, you can just jump on farm chests or bosses for guns or just kill some bandits and skags. Either way it is a great way to waste countless days!"
13802,greay game
13803,"Это шутер от первого лица. Действие разворачивается на малонаселенной и пустынной планете Пандора. Почти все злодеи и персонажи здесь карикатурные. Оружие делится на классы: дробовики, пистолеты, снайперские винтовки, пистолеты-пулеметы, штурмовые винтовки, гранатометы, есть даже образцы инопланетной технологии. Новые уровни дают очки развития, на которые улучшаются навыки. В игре есть кооперативное прохождение. Все сюжетные квесты остаются в силе, просто вознаграждение теперь дается каждому члену команды. Моя оценка 10/10."
13804,"Super fun game! RPG+FPS haha, co-op is fun too"
13805,Bang bang. Takatakatakataka. Shkk-shkk... KerrPLAAAAOW.
13806,"Best FPS-RPG around (I like System Shock 2 even more but SS2 isn't very readily available).
If you like the genre and haven't tried this, get it right away with DLCs.
Loads of fun, especially with friends."
13807,Amazing game. Really worth the money
13808,"Game of the year, every year!"
13809,"I somehow missed out on Borderlands when it was the new hotness, and only wishlisted it on a whim when I saw it won GOTY.

A friend gifted it to me, and now I'm losing sleep. Fun, simple, and a great use of contrasting cell shading and stylized video make for a very enjoyable game."
13810,"Let's face it... It's a game that you can play with others, that has a lot to do, is fun, humorous and quirky... A great mix!"
13811,Nice peaceful game
13812,"Not the best RPG, not the best FPS I've ever played, but certainly one of the best RPG+FPS combinations with a very, very accurately expressed theme and feeling of apocalyptic(-wild-west) world. Great game!"
13813,"A solid mix between FPS and RPG, they call it RPS, and thats exacly what it is.
Exceptional."
13814,"It's a great game. I played the Xbox 360 version. Great no matter how many times you play through it; the enemies adapt to your level, both in experience and skill, and the DLCs offer some amazing extra content."
13815,"Fun, but you really really really need to do it Co-Op."
13816,lots of guns.
13817,"I don't know exactly why, but I got SO INTO this game. I played it almost like a full-time job for two weeks when I didn't have any classes.

Addicting? Oh yes. But awesome."
13818,"is good game, i enjoy broderlunds."
13819,Borderlands is simply this: Candy-coated beer laying naked in a bed of rose petals.
13820,Probably the best Co-Op RPG FPS I've ever played.
13821,Отличная экшен рпг! Больше даже говорить ничего не нужно=)
13822,You don't have this yet? Seriously?
13823,"If you like shooters and/or RPGs, Borderlands is one of the most fun games developed in the past decade."
13824,<3
13825,"There are 17,750,000 different weapons.  Have fun."
13826,"I've had a good run at this game and I've really really enjoyed it. I've been quite impressed by the weapons and character progression and enemies... it's really been a lot of fun. Like all things, there are parts I could see being different or better but I'd say overall this game is worth paying for if you dig Action RPGs and FPSs."
13827,"Borderlands is a fast-paced, quest based FPS/RPG hybrid based in the dry, dusty planet of Pandora. You take up the role of one of four treasure hunters, each with their own class (simply: gunner, tank, recon, magic). The setting is post-apocalyptic, so if Fallout 3/New Vegas is a Tank, Borderlands is a Ferrari. One is slow and steady, one is lightning quick.

The game is fun alone, but shines with friends, as you can build a four person team with your Steam buddies for some shared mayhem. Besides that, a random weapon system (stats and looks wise) and deeply customizable skill trees make this game a lot of fun. Be sure to grab the GOTY bundle for a LOT more gameplay for a very small amount of money."
13828,"It doesn't make sense, and it doesn't have to."
13829,A classic.  Get your time in before the sequel comes!
13830,"The best way to describe how I feel about Borderlands is to call it a love-hate relationship.

As a gamer I put a lot of emphasis on story, character, and the game world itself and in doing so I'm able to cut games a lot of slack if their lacking in gameplay but weave great narratives. Unfortunately I find it hard to do so when the experience is vice versa.

That being said Borderlands offers very little in terms of a coherent well-paced story, fine tuned characters, and a fantastically designed rich world. 

The story is barebones and uninspired, the characters - though quite humorous and well voiced - are cardboard thin, and despite sporting a visually appealing artistic style the world feels empty and dead even when its populated by respawning enemies.

However, there's no denying that Borderlands can be incredibly fun to play. 

Combat is fast paced and thrilling, each player character feels unique to use, and the loot/insta-reward system makes the game hard to put down when you really get going. In addition, taking full advantage of the 4 player co-op only works to further enhance the addictive gameplay. 

Taking all of this into account it's easy to see why I had the experience I did with Borderlands.

If you don't care too much for narrative or you want a game where you can just turn your brain off and shoot things this is the game for you. If not then you might also develop a love-hate relationship of your own with Borderlands."
13831,Time to visit Pandora numerous opportunities to shot everything down!
13832,A Very Good 4 Player (Or Singleplayer) Ego-SHooter RPG with a brutal touch and a funny robot =)
13833,"Brilliantly addictive mix of an FPS with Diablo style loot hunting.  Even if you never touch multiplayer, the game has enough content to last awhile (especially if you have the GOTY edition)."
13834,"I have had a hell of a lot of fun with Borderlands. :) It is just one of those games I can keep coming back to and playing over and over (haven't yet finished a single character though). 

With the sequel coming out soon, NOW is the time to pick this up and give it some of your valuable time. It has an awesome atmosphere and can be played either solo or 4 player co-op. 

I must say I have had more fun playing in co-op with friends.

Borderlands certainly won't disappoint."
13835,FKING AWESOME
13836,Bom jogo.
13837,So many hours of enjoyment. Definitely worth the sale price. Hours and hours of GUNS!!!!
13838,"Really worth it, hope the second one is as good as this!"
13839,borderlands
13840,"I know I'm late to the party, but this is a great game."
13841,"So good, I can't wait for the second."
13842,"LOOK AT ALL THESE GUNS, GURL"
13843,"Good game to play on a LAN with your homies.  A good amount of weapons to choose from, and loot gets better with bigger parties."
13844,one of the best multiplayer co op games around
13845,Diablo....... with guns!!
13846,hours...upon hours of pure awesome
13847,"Decent four player co-op action, great for a LAN."
13848,Excellent game combining FPS and RPG elements. One of my recent favorites.
13849,"With its mind boggling array of guns to kill enemies with and the stylized type graphics, Borderlands is certainly a stand out among rpg fps's."
13850,Awesome game
13851,Borderlands is probably the most fun game to come out since its release in 2009.  The co-op is excellent (and certainly a deal-maker) and the loot-fest element is so satisfying and unprecedented in a FPS (to my knowledge).
13852,Do you like loot? Do you like shooting stuff? Maybe Borderlands?
13853,"An enjoyable experience infused with great comedy, made better by playing together with a couple of friends."
13854,Better with friends
13855,"Amusing characters, endless gun possibilities, and the ability to do co-op questing with some friends will keep you playing."
13856,"Cool setting, funny characters, tons of awesome guns, and multiplayer with actual RPG character progression, possibly the most fun I've had in an FPS."
13857,"Best played in co-op, this game is a blast from start to finish, and some of the DLC is really good.  With an insane number of weapons, cool skill trees and nice art style, the game offers dozens of hours of entertainment.  Well worth getting, especially for playing with friends."
13858,"Endless game, worth every cent!"
13859,"It's not often you see a game like this enters the market, and it's a breath of fresh air after the copy-paste military first person shooters you see on the market today.
What's so special about Borderlands is that's an FPS, but heavily focusing on RPG too! This is the best RPG game I've played on the PC platform.
The art style can't be forgotten here also. It's not ""Crysis graphics"", it looks more like a comic book coming to life! It's simply amazing! 
If you enjoy FPS that's focusing at the RPG elements at the same time, this is a must have! 
"
13860,"Right, to all those who don't have this; Comical, Time-filling, Amazingly Well Thought out game, dig deep and buy the GOTY Edition which contains all the DLC for the same price as the sole game itself, Right now it's sale time and the Game/GOTY Edition is at a whoping £5, This is definitely a game to have on your computer as you and three other friends can play online and kill mindless badguys together, plus it's a very unique game as a Shooter RPG, so for Five of your english pounds, this can be yours today (For the rest of the Summer Sale 2012 Period)"
13861,This is a must have game for any lovers of shooters and looters.
13862,"An excellent unique first person RPG. Tons of variety in guns, leveling with upgradable skills, enemies, missions, and environments. 

The gameplay is unique and enjoyable for its time and still is. As you attack enemies you see damage numbers appear above their heads, you level up by taking out enemies and completing missions - the leveling feels really satisfying and encourages you to keep playing to get stronger and gain better abilities. It's big on looting - you'll sure enough be choosing which weapons and gear are better to keep and which ones you want to sell or drop.

I played most of the game by myself and enjoyed it a lot, but there's even online co-op, up to 4 players drop-in/drop-out, which really just adds to the fun and makes it more of a social experience.

The toon visual style suits it really well too!

9/10
+ Unique: FPS RPG.
+ Tons of variety.
+ Leveling system feels satisfying.
+ Co-op (up to 4 players online) is specular."
13863,"One part skill, one part stats. It all comes together here. Oh, and did I mention loot? LOOT!!!"
13864,Een van de beste nieuwe IP's van de afgelopen jaren. Tot deel 2 uitkomt is dit zeker een game om je mee te vermaken
13865,One of the best rpg/fps games ever made!
13866,"한동안 재미있게 했음..
계속 뛰어다니는게 좀 지루하지만  할만함.
보더랜드2 기다리는데 디아블로3보단 나을거같음."
13867,Borderlands2 is comming out in september! But this is a must play before that :) Guaranteed fun and crazyness ;)
13868,"An FPS that is somewhat Rogue-like. Some glaring issues with multiplayer, and a not-quite-right balance to the quality of loot, when I played it originally at least, lead me to pass it off as not great.

Playing some co-op recently it was still passable."
13869,Must have
13870,Awesome story line. Extremly many weapons. Awesome graphic. Hours of gameplay
13871,This game is awesome - even more than any Blizzard-Title intented to be some months ago...  It should be called Addiction!
13872,"Welcome to Pandora.  I can easily sell this game to you as Diablo with guns.  An I would be both right and wrong.  This game is flat out fun. I mean like did 8 hours just pass wtf fun.  Meant as a co-op shooter or multi player loot fest.  Single player is fun too but this game is meant to play, shoot, loot and rinse repeat.  I loved the cell shaded style, and every DLC I played was fun.  Fun a game I keep coming back to and isn't that way we play games in the first place?  In my top 10 or 15 of all time fun, I could play all night with my friends games.  An Borderlands 2 comes out in September people so play this and get ready for more guns, more claptrap, and more FUN."
13873,"Borderlands is fantastic, fps, beautifully stylised and good humor."
13874,"A FPS, RPG, with D3 style loot. Grab a few friends, and a gamer acronym to english converter and GET IN HERE!!!"
13875,이겜 재미있음 ㅇㅇ
13876,Awesome mix of RPG and shooter. Very fun co-op if you have the right friends to play it with.
13877,"One of the most seemless, refreshing, and downright fun multiplayer experiences I've had in the genre.  Though I've never experienced the campaign without some friends to shoot things up with me, the game is good for action-packed fun mixed with a good bit of humor."
13878,"Fantastic, even better i now have on PC as well"
13879,If you dont have this game (GOTY edittion) yet then your dumb
13880,GAME OF THE YEAR
13881,"Игра шикарная... особенно с друзьями по сети квесты проходить не скучно... то, что надо..."
13882,"Borderlands melds Shooter and RPG for an exciting experience. Best played with friends, or other people and the downloadable content."
13883,"Great fun, but it's very addictive!"
13884,MULTIPLAYAARRSZZZ!!!
13885,Super beats fun.
13886,"If you don't know anything about this game, it is FPS - loot game with rpg elements. Up to 4 player coop. If you like shooting off heads, gettings lots of shiny things and leveling up characters then this one is a must. It is very repetitive but aren't most games? Best played with friends."
13887,"This melding of both FPS/RPG is flawlessly amazing.  One of the most fun games to play by yourself, that only gets better the more friends you play with.  Do not pass on the chance to play this game before its sequel comes out.  When the sequel comes out make sure you have about 2 months to take off because you will not want to put the controller down once you have the game."
13888,"Good, long, nice looking and fun game"
13889,Awesome game! Many hours of fun.  Lots of custimization.
13890,"Greatest game I've played in recent years.  First thing in a long time that I've actually thought ""This was worth spending money on.""  Even if it hadn't been on sale when I got it, if I had known how great it was, I'd probably have shelled out for it."
13891,Buy this game.
13892,"Borderlands game of the year for only 7 bucks? You would be stupid not to buy this, and the game offers around 60-80 hours of content and has customization. FPS+rpg = Hell yes."
13893,good game
13894,"A very well made game. The gunplay is a delight and having limitless guns means you're always coming across something unique. Best played with friends, Borderlands feels quite solitary on your own."
13895,good buy for a fiver
13896,Very nice game 90/100 My opinion!
13897,"It is THE BEST co-op game ever made. Nothing has come close to the variety, accessibility and fun of Borderlands when played together with a friend. Beautiful cell shaded landscapes, different enemies and creatures to hunt, interesting quests, diverse quests make this game a must buy for anyone looking to game with a friend. I'm looking forward to its sequel."
13898,Shut up and buy it!
13899,This is one of the bests games I ever played.
13900,Get to kill lots of people and creatures
13901,Fun game
13902,"Great game, plenty of different guns to choose from and it gets even better with co op and the dlc's."
13903,"This game is Torchlight/Diablo as a First Person Shooter.  The first campaign is fun.  Running through campaign plus can be tedious, but it only becomes so about 150 hours in.  If you're looking for a good FPS with a lot of content good humor/endless fun, this game might be for you."
13904,"You should buy it, its cheap!"
13905,"For fans of the RPG genre (Diablo 2, Diablo 3) and fans of the FPS genre (TF2, L4D) - Borderlands strikes a great balance as a ""Role Playing Shooter."" Add to that amazing replay value, 4 player co-op, and an excellent campaign storyline suitable for solo play, Borderlands is practicallly a must have for today's PC gamers. 

I'll be jamming Borderlands 2 straight out of the gate come its September 2012 release date. Hopefully by then Diablo 3 players will be cooling off a little and looking for something new. Hit me up if you'd like to get a game going come release time."
13906,"Fast, fun, and simple.... Boarderlands is what you'd get by making DIablo or another Action RPG into an FPS!"
13907,"Cant wait for the Sequel, this game is a really fun, fps mixed with  little rpg"
13908,"Tons of hours of enjoyment, a decent - but sadly repitive - storyline, and almost limitless weapon choices.

Overall, definitely worth it in the end."
13909,"A pretty fun combination of 1st person shooter and loot based RPG. Better with friends especially after playthrough 2.

Boss battles can get pretty crazy."
13910,SUPER CO-OP GAME :D MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE!
13911,Insanely fun. Period.
13912,"Pain in the ass, but none the less a good co-op shooter"
13913,GREATNESS !!!!!!
13914,I wish there were 25 hours every day so I could play an extra hour of Borderlands each day.
13915,recommending this for the badge
13916,"So much loot it never gets old.
"
13917,GAMES AMAZING!!! can't wait for #2
13918,Fabulous game. Especially if you're in to looting á la Diablo and also FPS games. Highly recommended!
13919,"What?!  I haven't made a recommendation for borderlands yet?  Maybe that's because I've been too busy playing it.  Honestly, if you don't own this game already, you are doing something wrong.

Go buy this game right now.

5/5"
13920,"Liked it a lot more than I thought it would.  Plus, gives you a chance to become a better marksman in other FPS games.  Really helped me with TF2.  Plus, the game itself is just a lot of fun."
13921,You need this now so you'll be ready for BL2
13922,"This is a perfect mix between FPS and Coop RPG. Enriching stories and game mechanics allow different playstyles. Can't wait for BL2!

13923,um jogo que recumendo ao viciados de FPS

13925,"This game is amazing, it has a great story and a shit load of guns.

as long as you can look past its many glitches or use them to your advantage.

I recomend this game to enyone who just wants to kill shit."
13926,awesome game
13927,excelente juego
13928,"Great storyline, nice gameplay, innovative features and bazzilion guns. This shooter with rpg elements is just AWESOME"
13929,"A delightful, Mad Max done in Maya sort of FPS. It has a rather DiabloII-esque skill tree, has more weapons and what not than you can shake a stick at, different classes to play, and the expansions are a blast and worth the extra munnies."
13930,"A really great coop game with tons of things to do , Even the DLC´s are worth it .  visuals are a bit dated by now and cell shading does not appeal to everyone."
13931,Great 4 Player Co-op.  Nice visual design.  Tons of gameplay.
13932,A lot of fun co-operatively.  Not so much by yourself.  Get some friends and have a blast!
13933,A Diablo-style Action-RPG from a First Person viewpoint - with guns. What's not to love?
13934,"Borderlands! It's like Diablo with guns.  A BAZILLION guns!  Pistols that shoot rockets,  Automatic sniper rifles, Shotguns with a 4x zoom and accuracy to match.  If you want an RPG with stats but also love guns, this is THE game to get."
13935,One of the best coops I've played in years.
13936,"One fun game... Shooting, questing,looting.... not much else, but who needs more ? =D"
13937,very good
13938,so fun
13939,It's only full of AWESOME.
13940,"Diablo 2 with billion of guns)

13941,Very Good Game

13943,aint no rest for the wicked !

13945,"Great game, lots of fun"
13946,xDDD
13947,"Remember, if it took you more than one shot, you weren't using a Jakobs!"
13948,"Too good, just too good for words, can't wait for 2!"
13949,One of the best crazy and fun games you can play!
13950,Awesome ! Waiting for Borderlands 2 !
13951,"Always a good time like a midget hooker with one arm, one leg, no teeth and trying to eat corn on the cob."
13952,Best FPS ever!
13953,"Such a great and suprising expierence, although I may have my own personal gripes about this game I  always find myself having fun when playing with friends."
13954,"Guns, guns, and more guns.  What's not to love."
13955,Play it.  You will know after that.
13956,"A LOT of fun for those that like collecting and hoarding.

It was just a large mindless shoot-em-up level up game. 150 hours plus w/friends....."
13957,"17.5 million possible guns await you in this wacky FPS. Though very linear & straight forward, it simply fun finding the next new weapon to supplement or outclass everything you already have. Then there is watching said rifle, shotty, pistol, rocket launcher, melt, detonate, or burn enemies away. There are 4 classes as well. Each with experience & branching abilities to choose, making you the most effective scum-swatter planetside.
The game's wackiness comes from the dialogue between some characters.
Best done in Multiplayer.
The DLC is good too.
Even though part 2 is almost here it's still fun & pretty...& pretty fun.
It's not the Wacky-Waving-Inflatable-Arm-Flailing-Tube-Man of FPS' ...but it's close.
PS: Get good with Longbow grenades. hehhehehehehehe"
13958,BRO-DERLANDS
13959,"One of the best action shooters around, the weapons are limitless and the non-stop excitement is second to none. If you want over-the-top badass fun, Borderlands is where its at."
13960,its good
13961,fun co-op campaign
13962,"This is a diablo FPS set in a cell shaded space western where you can shoot missles that shoot missles that blow up enemies.  Yes, its most fun with friends but its friend system sucks.  I still put 300 hours on it (9.5/10)"
13963,"Borderlands is addictive.Excellent game play, intuitive gun play and a great mix of types of quests.Love this game."
13964,This is probbly the best Fps Rpg game i have played.
13965,"Un FPS con la peculiaridad de ser ademas un RPG, muy entretenido y con unos DLC muy bueno que ofreceran mucha mas divercion."
13966,Great game.
13967,ABSOLUTLEY LOVE IT. Spent most of my hours on the PS3 version of it though :D Repeated playthroughs still bring the best of the game out <3 Lilith.
13968,"Great post apocalyptic shooter with a sense of humour, huge variation in weaponry, lots of stories and decent DLC.  Good value :)"
13969,"Aside from beinga semi-dodgy console port, its still a hell of a lot of fun."
13970,Great game
13971,"Fun combat and a steady flow of rewards make this journey a massively enjoyable one, especially with some fellow mercenaries along for the ride.
by some guy from gamespot on October 20, 2009"
13972,"Borderlands is pretty awesome. The gameplay is fun for a while and the characters are absolutely amazing. The only problem is sooner or later you're going to get either bored with the game or really pissed at the ending. No spoilers, but the ending is absolutely WTF. If it's on sale, I would recommend buying it since you can drop quite a few hours into the game. The dlc definitely added some much awesome stories and gameplay. Damn you Dr. Zed!

8.5/10.0"
13973,good stuff
13974,This is where all started :)
13975,"Playing Diablo 3 (and getting kind of disappointed) made me go back to this game. So much more fun in the ""item porn"" RPG style.
It's fun, it's stylish, it's brutal, it's funny.
Better played online with friends. Get the Game of The Year Edition."
13976,"This game was a blast. The art style is great, the Diablo style loot, the 4 player coop, and the world itself is just enjoyable. This game is totally worth checking out with 3 of your friends."
13977,Good game
13978,It's like Diablo 2 with guns and fun.
13979,"Just one word, awesome game.

Some flaws of course:

- Worst ending of a game in the history of time :)
- Ridicolous penalties for dying.
- Easy Bosses
- Buggy.
 Nevertheless, best game ive played this year for now. So much fun!

9.5/10"
13980,"Super jeu, un peu répétitif à force mais qui vaut vraiment le coup, surtout en GOTY pour profiter de tous les DLCs. Si vous voulez du fun, jouez en ligne avec des amis. Bref, un jeu à tester absolument, au moins avant la sortie du 2."
13981,Great shooter. Well written. Great with friends. Very pretty. Play it already!
13982,Very interesting.
13983,Great game!
13984,"Very much an addicting game, especially if you like RPG's and plenty of loot to collect. Fun alone, more fun with friends."
13985,DO DO DO DO DO DO DO
13986,"Tired of the same old first person shooters, with all their ""engaging gameplay"" or ""non-repetitive quests"" or ""variable color palettes?"" Then Borderlands is for you! With the most cutting edge graphic capabilities, this game can constantly render up to 450 shades of brown, including Autumn, Rust, Sienna, and few more! Also, the ending is really something that will leave you speechless. I wholeheartedly recommend gifting this game to anyone you hate, and watch them squirm as they try to appreciate it."
13987,im 12 end dis gaem ass rally gud u shld  by it cuz it c00l & 133+
13988,Amazing.
13989,"Well, I highly recommend this game for those who like RPGs and FPS, this is the ultimate baby from those categories, IT IS AWESOME!"
13990,"y not?, its fun"
13991,Ne hagyd ki életed top listás játékát :)
13992,A masterpiece of a game marrying two of the best genres around.
13993,fun that never gets old
13994,Funny
13995,i have literally had friends fall asleep while playing this game. it's that boring.
13996,Fun game... I love the characters in it... wish the 'unskippable' chick was something you could turn off...
13997,I like this.

14001,good！
14002,Must have. Love the zombie dlc
14003,Seriously Funny
14004,Замечательная Diablo-подобная стрелялка с кучей стволов и просто шикарными персонажами/диалоги (на английском языке)
14005,"Great game, especially co-op. Somewhat different to most first person shooters, with a decent storyline, and experience points and levels. Weapons are diverse and generally unique from each other."
14006,отличная игра но еслиб небыло коопа я бы не купил бы
14007,A very good co-op game. Tons of guns to choose from and all that.
14008,Fun game to play multiplayer
14009,Brolands. Play it now before the second one.
14010,One of the best games I ever played. Simple insane and fun.
14011,"Well... Like Marcus says... ""A day without slaughter is like a day without sunshine.""... I have spent many hours enjoying borderlands."
14012,Ain't no rest for the wicked.
14013,"Think of it as Mad Max on an alien planet.  Strangely addictive shoot and loot (with some RPG mechanics mixed in).

I say strangely because how much I enjoyed it kind of snuck up on me."
14014,Maliwan #1
14015,coop goodness
14016,Shoot the things.
14017,One of the best damn games in a long time. It's an FPS Diablo which can be played with four of your friends and is genuinely funny. Based on that description you'll know if you want it or not.
14018,Just... awesome.
14019,Must-play.
14020,"""This planet smells like hemorrhoids wrapped in bacon."""
14021,"Ah Borderlands, how I loved thee. At least until Steam Cloud support was added, and my save game file was over-written. Bye, bye max level Lillith. This is a cheap, fun game and worth checking out before Borderlands 2 comes out later this year."
14022,The bees knees
14023,"I put over a hundred hours into the original Borderlands and I still struggle to explain why. It was a cathartic experience with a satisfying amount of loot, shooting and story. The story is quite restrained in contrast to its sequel, and I think this works in its favour. Things are hinted at and left up to the player to imagine. The game is definitely better with the General Knox and Claptrap DLC. The ending is a bit of a let down, and they improve on the endings in the DLC - but still the original game might leave some wanting and this makes a poor platform from which to try and sell DLC."
14024,Buy this
14025,This game is Intoxicating. Possibly one of the best games i Have ever played. Can't wait for the sequel.
14026,The best Co-Op game so far.
14027,"Even with the second Borderlands out, I love roaming Pandora in the first. This game nailed it's aesthetic and game-feel. DLC is excellent too."
14028,"Not brilliant, merely very good with caveats, but does for me what Diablo II used to."
14029,tons.of.guns.tons.of.fun.

14034,Such a fun game to play! Play it before Borderlands 2 comes out!
14035,Pure fun for many hours. Borderlands Is probably one of my most played games overall (considering I have bought it for every console it is avaliable on). This game is worth the money and then some. With Borderlands 2 coming out on September 18th I can't wait to set foot in Pandora again.

14039,Strip the flesh! ... Salt the wound!
14040,"One of the longest co-op games I've ever played. Billions of weapons and fun leveling up system. Plus it has unique, beatiful graphics. :)"
14041,Great game!
14042,"A great game for casual FPS players. The RPG elements and the awesome stylized visuals make for a more well-rounded experience. Highlights include fun gameplay, funny dialogue, interesting design, and a long campaign. Weaker aspects include the skeletal (though compelling) plot structure, a somewhat roundabout mapping system, and fall damage. Overall, this is a great game and was fun with any combination of 1-4 players. The DLC is of the same quality as the main game, and the sequel is another great game."
14043,"best game ever
Still the best"
14044,"A great game, the perfect combination between RPG and shooter. Complete the missions, kill the foes, level up your character and unveil an interesting story for more than 100 hours of gameplay. I just hope you don't get dissapointed by what's inside the Vault... If you're able to fidn it."
14045,"Fun, fun, fun!"
14046,"Borderlands is a great game FPS-RPG who make it the best kind of game (I really enjoy fps games but this one got RPG things, like skills, different kinds of weapons, enemies, etc)."
14047,"Whatever you buy in your life, This is a MUST!! Make 3 of your friends buy it too so you guys can co-op the whole game, It's amazing, trust me :)"
14048,"Aside from its shortcomings in terms of enemy variety and the overhyped gun variety, Borderlands is still a great game. Single player isn't really where it shines, but driving through the wastelands with three friends doesn't get much better than it does in this game.

If you can find people who haven't already played it to death (or can't wait until its sequal comes out) then definitely pick it up!"
14049,best co-op
14050,Great game for coop... looking forward to the sequel!
14051,"This game is loads of fun, 4 player online co-op that adds higher chances of better baddies to fight and better loot drops for the already thousands upon thousands of guns. The quests are okay except for the Scvanger quests which just give you the general location of the items and if you don't remember where the items are you spend more time the next time you play it. My other complaint lies in the Boss which is basically a rehash of the Half-Life: Opposing Force boss which is OKAY since gearbox made the expansions, but it was a letdown to say the least.  ALSO SCREW YOU GAMESPY."
14052,Get you one! :D
14053,a great game.
14054,You get to shoot midgets and collect loot.
14055,"It's decent. Probably best with friends. But unless you all start at the same time and play through together, it'll get incredibly lopsided very fast."
14056,"i doubted in this game,  pretty cool!"
14057,"Lots of loot, and lots of fun! Best with friends."
14058,"Excellent game, can't wait what Borderlands 2 brings."
14059,Whar is sequel? Whar?
14060,"This game has FPS and RPG mixed together which makes it total badass!
There are over billions of different weapons to find with different kind of damages.
You can also choose out 4 characters who have different skills and if you are with friends it makes it more interesting and FUN."
14061,"One of the best fps's I have ever played, each game is NEVER the same and the possibilites are unlimited."
14062,"Początkowo ciekawe, ale szybko się nudzi. Kupcie tylko jeśli macie znajomych do zagrania razem."
14063,★★★★★
14064,"A great game that i gave a lot of stick to but ended up loving it.

Borderlands is a great game overall. Plenty of weaopns, a RPG system (abliet easily corruptable, only if you choose to of course) and the health collection of shooting the faces of whatever moves, with upto 4 people i may add.

Story: You are looking for a Vault, guided by a stranger. Thats somewhat it. No deep storyline but don't worry, the RPG aspects help you love your character were the story doesnt.

Graphics: Less said the better. Well lets say this. Fuck Cel Shader graphics, 1/10 for graphics

Gameplay: Classic, mean, fun and overkill. Four words i love to say about games. Finding that epic gun that beats your other guns by miles is just a nice warm feeling.

Pro's:
- Great large levels
- Epic guns
- Plenty of shit to shoot

Con's:
- Diabolical graphics
- Maybe the maps are a tad too big at times

8.5/10 - Get it"
14065,awesome game
14066,"Master work, awesome"
14067,still fun after all this time
14068,"One of the greatest and most replayable games to have been released this decade. Even with the sequel close on the horizon, Borderlands (and its DLCs) are well worth the money!"
14069,omfg <3
14070,"Fairly rough around the edges compared to Bl2, but where the game counts, its loot, is fantastic. Upgrades feel meaningful and enemies are fun to slaughter with YOUR GUNS THAT DON'T ALL FIRE ROCKETS AND FUCKIN E-TECH ORBS GOD DAMNIT GEARBOX."
14071,"Borderlands is one of the best ideas I've ever seen in a game. It's a loot-based hack'n'slash... except instead of hack and slash, you have shoot and explode. Lots of randomized guns, so you're constantly switching them out, even if one type isn't super different from another. The co-op is great, and the graphics are gorgeous and unique. 5/5

Now let's revise this review for 2016!

Borderlands is one of the best ideas (I'd) ever seen in a game. It's a loot-based hack'n'slash... except instead of hack and slash, you have to shoot and explode. (At the time, this was virtually unheard of: l)ots of randomized guns, so you're constantly switching them out, even if one type isn't super different from another(, was a crazy idea then. Not as much now, with plenty of little first-person roguelikes on the market, among other shooters of various types. Even so, this remains perhaps my favorite version of this concept, and still feels like it has the deepest pool of viable random guns. Even the sequel doesn't feel as good in this regard. As such, I still highly recommend it; t)he co-op is great, and the graphics are gorgeous (even if the style has been aped in dozens of games since then.)"
14072,"Borderlands is still my all-time favorite coop game. Heavy on action and light on RPG gives it the perfect blend. If you haven't tried this yet, you are seriously missing out on a good thing."
14073,Diablo 2 meets Fallout 3. ITS CRACK NUKKA!
14074,"This game is, to me, is the way that a game like Diablo is brought into a new genre, specifically shooter. Although it is far more quirky, and humorous than its spiritual ancestor, Diablo 2, this is one of the best ARPG Shooters to be developed. 

However, for the fan of other RPG Shooters, allow me to place this on a RPG-Shooter spectrum: Fallout 3 is more of a RPG (75%) than Shooter (25%). Now reverse that degree: For as much as Fallout 3 is more of a RPG than a Shooter, Borderlands is more a Shooter (75%) than a RPG (25%). It is not a fault of either game, both are fantastic. Just know that for this game, item looting and shooting everything > RPG. Highly recommended."
14075,"Do you like looting RPG's like Diablo? Do you also happen to like FPS games? Well you are going to like Borderlands because it's an RPG/FPS hybrid. Borderlands is set on a barren wasteland planet known as Pandora which was abadoned by a mining corporation. You play one of the 4 Vault hunters trying to search for alien technology on the planet. Everytime you kill stuff, there is always loot. There are so many weapons in the game. More than 300,000 combinations. I am not even kidding. The art style is great resembling a comic book adventure. It's also a cooperative shooter so if you got friends, it will be a great experience and ton of fun missions and quests to do."
14076,"This game is loads of hours of fun, try it!! :-)"
14077,"This game is a Masterpeace, The Best RPSG ( Role Playing Shooter Game ) I EVER Played Till now... If you like Games Like Diablo, Dungeon Siege 1 & 2  and other RPG games, Combine it With a Shooter game like Doom and Borderlands is what you Get, This game is AMAZING, Full Of Quest & Weapons and Items that you can farm for Days, I pass this game last year, and im still playing the DLC of it now, since its a Very Long Game... 10 / 10   Perfect !!!  EXTEAMLY RECOMMENDED TO PLAY..."
14078,Fun game! If you are looking for a FPShooter against PvE than this is the game for you at the moment.
14079,"If you want a good FPS , fun and great Coop game. Look no further..this is it!"
14080,"Sledge .
FPS . 18/20"
14081,"Very fun, co-op is the best!"
14082,Not to be missed!
14083,i think u would like this game if u play a sort of story line first person shooter.
14084,"Play dis Bitch
"
14085,"Brilliant marriage of Role playing and shooter genres. Best RPG, best shooter, best game. Period."
14086,This is honestly the most fun game I've ever played co-op.. the story is absolutely hilarious as is the characters you play. Am I the only one that cannot WAIT until Borderlands 2 is out?
14087,It's fun and annoying at the same time
14088,One of the best fun games!
14089,"Amazing FPS game with awesome cell shading effects, thousands of weapons, skill trees and wonderfull co-op experience. Put 300hours+ into the game on my xbox wich is no difference from the pc version, must have game!"
14090,"I haven't played this game in almost a year until today.  Man, now I remember why I spent damn near 60 hours playing it.  It's FUN!! I loot grabbing, rootin, tootin, shootin, lootin, and all around damn good time FPS!! Buy the game, play it now before BL2 comes out!  Another MUST PURCHASE for gamers of today!"
14091,Great adventure! Only thing missing is a good pair of chaps
14092,"Pack your bags guys, it's time to go to... PANDORA! No, not that expensive alien pocahontas rip-off, I'm talking about the RPG-like FPS that is Borderlands!

The game is about 4 vault hunters. Mordecai the Sniper, Brick the Tank, Roland the Soldier and then there's Lilith the Elemental Cougar (and the only female). With their powers combined, they scour Pandora in search of the fabled Vault, hidden deep within Pandora.

Now that sounded awesome, right? NOPE! That is just the sugar-coated, honey-glazed, dipped-in-caramel with a double serving of sweets way of describing the story of Borderlands, the story is actually crap.

For a game meant to be played by 4 players, single-player is boring. It can get pretty lonely in Pandora with only one guy (or girl) out and about. The main point of this game is co-op. Now THAT's where the party starts. The game's multiplayer mechanics are simple but effective.

More players = Tougher enemies
Tougher enemies = Better Loot!!

Overall, I give a 9/10"
14093,3 times better than doing nothing.
14094,This forever.
14095,"
"
14096,"Best RPG-shooter, with badass humor. ENGOOORGE."
14097,"First-person Diablo, basically. Haven't tried it multi-player, imagine it would be more engaging than solo.
2019 update: Yes, it is better with friends, especially split-screen couch-coop on a big screen (on xbox; not sure Steam can do the same). I prefer Borderlands to Borderlands 2 for the music, the grittier feel, and the less-focused-on-scrip; 2 had too many different currencies to grind. That's annoying when we just want to fsu."
14098,4fun
14099,"Take the core elements of the ever addictin ""hunt-and-gathering"" mechanics out of Diablo and streamline them into a great looking, sounding game. Playing in a world clearly inspired by Mad Maxx and enriched by some fantastic background tunes, this game is just very good. You can easily spend 50s of hours, best playing cooperatively! Cannot wait for the 2nd to arrive!!"
14100,"FPS with 4 player co-op and loot, please explain why you're looking for a recommendation for this game."
14101,"This game clearly stands out from the many other games, with its comic like graphics and endless guns."
14102,Good game
14103,"Horrible game by yourself, super fun with friends."
14104,"
"
14105,One oif the best Action-RPG mix ever. Play it. Now.
14106,"Also wo soll ich Anfangen? Erstmal sehr Abwechslungsreiche Grafik, sehr nette Gegner, schicker Multiplayer, sehr geile Waffen, lässt sich sehr schön Level´n alles in einem...
Ein super Singleplayer Action-RPG Shooter und das beste Spiel bzw. eines der besten Spiele die es gibt!!!"
14107,amazing game so easy to get hooked on can't wait for the 2nd!
14108,"Borderlands brings a nice touch to the FPS genre with it's comic type look and the game has an huge viority of weapons to shoot with.
And the DLCs bring even more content already fun packed game."
14109,DURR YES GET
14110,"Borderlands, a good game alone but extremely awesome if you play atleast 2 since the game was made for Co-Op. The 'story' is fun to play, and the variation of mobs is one thing that keeps you playing this game although it does get repetetive later on, it's still fun to just go around and grind mobs."
14111,Very fun shootem up game perfect for cross RPG FPS players.
14112,"Brondengars, that is all."
14113,!
14114,"Combine Call Of Duty's Aiming system with Diablos loot mechanic, mix in some post-apocalyptic humor and a bazillion guns and what do you get? Borderlands. An addictive little 4 player  romp through a planet called Pandora while going through more guns than a Smith & Wesson QA tester on a Monday. Borderlands is a great game for people who want a little more depth in their shooters, while its no Final Fantasy on the RPG side, its a great hybrid game with lots of charm. The second one cannot come out fast enough."
14115,Good game.
14116,Borderlands is a must play game. It is a first person shooter role playing game. There are a TON of guns in this game. This game is best played with others although can be played single player.
14117,"
"
14118,"Nice game overall. Worth its money. Fun, nice graphics and more compose one good piece of RPG."
14119,"A good game, Fast and Fun with tons of great guns and even better with mates, GOTY edition with the DLC is a lot of good gaming - Looking forward to no.2"
14120,"This game is still fun and its comic book graphics will never age. That being said its hard to get people to invest $30 into the game + DLC especially if they played, beat and put down the original copy. It also needs a patch the amazing amount of minor bugs. Seriously drop the DLC to $5 and cut us a simple patch to fix some of the guns and especially mismatched classmods. You will get some serious hype for borderlands 2 by showing you still support this."
14121,"I love the graphics in this game. I also like the entire RPG concept they used in this FPS; However, the story is bland and boring. It reminds me of Fallout, just with cell shaded graphics. Multiplayer is horrible. Single player is where it's at. If you're a fan of post apocalypse games, then you need to try this one for sure."
14122,"It gets sorta grindy after a while but then again what RPG doesn't.
Also there's a giant tentacle vagina monster surrounded by angels and you never get in the vault."
14123,awsome!!!!!!!!!
14124,"What if you took a Diablo 2 and Torrchlight style RPG and removed the drab point and click potion spamming interface and replaced it with a fantastic FPS interface, beautifully rendered environments, and a unique sense of style and humor? What you would get is Borderlands, a game that takes everything Diablo style games have done right and puts it in an FPS gamestyle that is far more engaging and skill based.

The game offers great mission variety (both main and side missions), as well as a diverse cast of characters with unique skill trees and playstyles. The game also doesn't rely on the whole ""this boss will require you spam potions more"" style of difficulty ramping that Diablo is far too reliant on. The additional DLC content is also top notch, particularly the General Knoxx DLC which adds enough content to almost feel like another game. Throw all this in an FPS with up to 4 player co-op multiplayer and deathmatch arenas as well and you've got a fantastic game."
14125,"FPS meets RPG in an orgy of destruction, with hundreds of weapons, varied talent trees, interesting enemies and environments and an involving narrative with plenty of humor sprinkled throughout. Two great tastes that taste great together."
14126,"I have to say that I have met so many of my Steam friends on this game it's one of the best, no wait, THE BEST SHOOTER I HAVE EVER PLAYED!  I love how it has the rpg elements and the skill tree and the add on packs just keep you playing.  Even though you might not have played any shooters, this one is the one to start off with!  Even though the origional level cap is 50, it still kept you playing for some time.  But when they released the new DLC packs like zombie Ned's place and the arena and claptrap the level cap increased to 69! Which kept you playing for EVEN LONGER!  If you don't already own this game GET IT!"
14127,"Too repetitive and filled with boring and ""MMO-esque"" quests. It is however, very FUN and addictive."
14128,The addictive loot hunts of Diablo mixed with the FPS trappings of today make for one of gaming's most enjoyable experiences. Especially with friends!
14129,"Not going to lie. The story felt a bit weak and empty, but if finding millions of different weapons (Literally. There are tons of combinations of item parts, so you're going to have fun with it) and shooting up baddies floats your boat, this is the game for you. The 4 different characters all have unique skills, and multiple playstyles to boot. Definitely check it out if you're an FPS and RPG fan."
14130,"An amazing ""hack,slash and loot"" game! For how old it is, its still a very fun game! Graphics are the typical cartoony style like mos 2K games are. A worth while buy with all DLC. Make sure you play with your friends, since the game can get quite tedious alone. Perfect for co-op whilst on Skype, teamspeak etc."
14131,"If you like cell shaded gaming, which I do not prefer, its going to be one of your favorite FPS/RPG games. Reasonably long main campaign, that drastically increases in difficulty as you play through it over again, and equally long (combined) DLC packs. Excellent playability value."
14132,Fantastic Game. Unique grahpics style and outragously fun gameplay. I highly recommend this game to everybody.
14133,get this game
14134,"Grinderlands? This game CAN be fun if you bring a group of your jolly freinds. The story is lacking to say the least. This game is and feels like a big grind. Quests are often fetch this, or kill x amount of that and lack creativity. You will be forced to do side quests to pursue the main quest ( which is not a particulary interesting one). The game has also completely removed any sense of achievement by having loot and enemies level up with you. The only way to extend your epenis are by statistics.

However the game's aesthetics come together perfectly. The world is quite a sight. The game has some pretty sweet soundtracks as well. Too bad they're only in the credits and in the start of the game. So if you got a bunch of jolly freinds that enjoy games with a lot of shooting, a steadfast artstyle and don't mind grinding. Then I would recommend it.

You can't adjust the FOV in the game. However by fickling around with the config files you should be able to do it (search the internet)."
14135,"An RPG with 1,000,000 guns on a desert planet with 2,000,000 targets. Fun core gameplay with no time wasted grinding for XP. Surprisingly memorable characters, from the NPCs to the bosses to the bad guys working for the bosses. Five dancing Claptraps out of five."
14136,"One of the best,most fun and addictive games I've played!!!"
14137,"If you're lookin' for a shooter game that will give you hours of fun - solo or multiplayer - I couldn't suggest a better game. I play Borderlands over and over because it never gets boring for me. Oh, and you get to shoot people, what more do you need to have a good time?"
14138,классная игра
14139,i watched some people play this once but i am not sure i care at all
14140,"87 Bazillion Weapons, Loot, Awesome Gameplay, awesome FPSRPG. oh, and GOTY"
14141,"A novel game that mixes a cell shaded first person shooter with elements of random loot generation and collection.  This is an unpretentious game that allows you to revel in a simple formula.  If it moves, shoot it.  If it drops loot, grab it.  The allocation of skills in character advancment is simple, but well balanced.  No matter where you put your points you wonder if a different build would be more effective - no dead skill cookie cutter formula here!"

14144,Good game but absolutely shit and pointless without friends to play with.
14145,This game will literally explode your proverbial nipples with gunslinging awesomeness. Mission based killgasm levelling up slushie of coolness.
14146,"I was hesitant to try this (I normally don't enjoy FPS') but it's turning out to be pretty fun!  If you're on the fence, I'd say give it a whirl."

14150,Diablo in form of FPS with loads of humor Gearbox style and remarkable graphics. You just have to love it and forgive it few bugs
14151,One of the best games I ever played!!
14152,Exelent 1st person RPG Co-Op Shooter!!!
14153,"The Game Beater has been DONE! This game is truly a Masterpiece, No other games can beat this game, Brilliant Animated Graphics and Amazing Gameplay with tons and tons of Missions. What about the shocking moments? Yes, it has that too! Everything you wante in a RPG Action game you can find it in one game, This Game! I would easily give 11/10 for this game, but as I know the rules I can't do that, so It's 10/10 :) ""Get it Today!"""
14154,It's Diablo with guns and humor. And more guns.
14155,"also, he has 3 balls"

14162,One of the greatest games to ever be made. Or that ever will be made. For shizzle.
14163,Great game. Hours upon hours of playtime as well as great replay value!
14164,"A terrific blend of RPG/Shooter and a lootfest all rolled into to one. Great coop game, can easily invest 40 hours into one character if not more. DLC is also amazing with what it adds in new locations, quests, and items. One of the greatest games of all time."

14168,"Amazing game. FPS with great DLCs. Game is amazing, and yes, there are as many guns in the game as they claim there are. Great FPS, game is just terrific. Deserves GoTY. Get this game with all DLCs today. Even has Co-Op!"
14169,"Ugh, boring and repetitive, in dialog, maps, voice clips, and grinding. It's as bad as the arrow-knee symptom of content density. Mostly because no one will play it with me, so the single player mode stinks. All of the fun in this game is in the multiplayer mode. They drop you off in the middle of nowhere without telling you how to play, and they never show you afterwards. Why do I own all these expansion packs? :( 2/10."

Borderlands is a new IP, and personally I'm glad I can say there is a sequel on the way. Borderlands humour, art style, guns and enemies make this game feel more alive than some MMOs on the market. Technical graphics arent amazing due to an old version of the UE3 and there are a few bugs but overlook them and you have one of the best FPSRPGs ever created. Or it could be the only FPSRPG ever made, in any case just buy it. You'll love it."
14171,Perfect FPS/Rpg Game - 9/10
14172,game SUCKS i go to BED
14173,the best shooter ever and in co-op even better ! :)
14174,Let it be known that this game helped stave off diablo fever for a few years
14175,"Świetna gra jeśli gramy ze znajomym w co-opie
W singlu lub z przypdakowymi ludźmi nie polecam i ocenilbym gdzieś na 5/10  ale w co opie z kumplem  jedna z lepszych gier w ogóle w jakie miałem przyjemność grać 
"
14176,"This game is a perfect example of how the sum of a game can be greater than its parts. When you break it down, there is nothing revolutionary about Borderlands. What makes this so great though is how well everything is done. Yes, it's another FPS action/adventure game, but in order to truly give credit to Borderlands, you cannot put enough emphasis on the action or adventure parts. It's absolutely refreshing to see adventure done right while keeping a very light and comedic feel to the whole thing. From the gunplay, to the art direction, Borderlands embodies what videogames should be, and that is pure fun."
14177,Always fun to hear the Crimson Lance scream when you hit them with a fire or corrosive weapon. 10/10
14178,Funny game in Comicstyle ... blood or no blood ... its funny ... i love to play it
14179,"It's like a FPS version of diablo. Tons and tons of loot can drop, and you go a questin for more stuff and to kill people. Cell shaded and very interesting, worth a try."
14180,GOOD GAME
14181,"The way I always describe Borderlands is ""it's like Fallout, but gritty."" I don't say that anymore because Fallout is actually quite gritty. Borderlands is like Fallout, but with more wacky humor. Yes, I said ""Wacky.""

It's an FPS RPG in which you play a treasure hunter on the Mad-Maxy world of Pandora. The enemies are crazy, the weapons are ridiculous, the robots are hilarious, and the skags are extra bitey.

As a side note, with 89 hours in, Borderlands is the game on Steam that I have played the most. So if you and I tend to like the same games, you will probably enjoy Borderlands.

The controls are good, the graphics are okay. Both of those can be remedied to ""excellent"" with any of the numerous ""tweak"" programs floating around the web.

Out of the box, I would call Borderlands unplayable. I will not play it without hacking the shit out of it. I can't imagine playing it on a console where you can't do any of that.

So as much as I love Borderlands, it's not fair to give it an A, because you MUST HACK IT to be able to play it.

For no other reason than that, C+. And that's being generous.

If I could just install it and play, it would get a solid A."
14182,"Great mixture of FPS and RPG elements. Hundreds of hours of gameplay in an open world envirionment, and the addition of co-op is very welcome."
14183,"This game is too short, but its alot of fun.  Hopefully the 2nd one is longer!"
14184,Lots of fun until you realize the flat gameplay. Leveling is more of a hurdle then a reward. Interesting graphics.
14185,"Awesome Co-op Game!

A Must buy for Gamers!

168+ hours and i'm still finding new loot :)"
14186,Remember a time when games barely had a point? When the main objective was to pew pew pew at everything? This is kinda like that...and its a good thing.
14187,"Wanted to be the modern Diablo.

Failed. In every conceivable way.

Was fun for about 2 minutes. Then torture for the remainder of the game.  Then we killed a giant space vagina.

Not kidding, that's the last boss.

Spoiler alert."
14188,the ending gave me cancer
14189,"In a time when cover system, regenerating health and linearity plagues shooters all around, Gearbox presented us with a simple yet ambitious formula. Mixing ye olde RPG elements of yore with pure, raw shooting mechanics and 87 BAZILLION GUNS (I know that's old already), Borderlands is one of the few bastions that remains true to it's roots nowadays. Pretty good on single player, almost criminally good to play in co-op. Warning: This one comes infected with Gamespy cancer. Nothing's ever perfect, is it?"
14190,Brilliant co-op game.
14191,"Weapon combinations seem to be infinite. Hidden treasures and challenges, skills developed to the players choosing and endless hidden humor all make for an amazing game. The online community is incredibly friendly. Finally an FPS that isn't completely about OMGHDGRAFIX or littered with young kids screaming about nothing."
14192,"Definitly a high quality game. Diablo style looting and action mixed with 4 player co-op, a great story , and more weapons than you can imagine. Worth every penny spent and every minute played."
14193,"Great fun with multiple people. More of a RPG than a FPS, but still, I like it that way. Not too much grinding is needed to level up, since there are always new quests available. This is the perfect game if you just want to get your killing out."
14194,This is must  be a game that i have been looked forward to for a long time!!
14195,"This game was and will always be amazing.

I have put almost a thousand hours into this game (most of which were off-steam) because it just keeps giving back. The Cooperative experience is where this game lives.  Playing alone will give only half the perspective. With a full party of four, this game goes places.  Much time will be spent clamoring over weapons and equipment. Sometimes the team will spend an hour just having a good time with the vehicle physics. Other times will be lulled waiting in towns and for shops to restock. When taken beyond the game's limit, Vehicles will be dropped through the map, superior parkour through entire levels and completely irrelevant adventures made by developer's mistake.  The game is just so engrossing, whether it is played as intended or off the record.

Some people may ask how I manage to spend so much time on a single game. I ask myself the same question. Glancing back, it's hard to imagine. Looking back, I reminisce of good times."
14196,"The best co-op game in years, and even more years to come!"
14197,"This games a total piece of shit. Graphics look dumb, lots of glitches, boring vanilla World of Warcraft style questing, and  a stupid story with stupid looking guns. However with the co-op, big bosses, humorous diologue and some secret formula I'll never get my hands on, this game sucked me in and I bought 4 different copies and beat it several times on multiple consoles... FUCK YOU BORDERLANDS CAN'T WAIT FOR BORDERGAY 2!!!!!!"
14198,This game is about lands of the border.
14199,"This is the worlds best shooter. Pick up BL 2 as well, far worth the money!!! :D"
14200,"Borderlands has alot of humour and you'll find yourself laughing at what the characters are saying. The character designs are interesting and funny, they're nice to look at. The huge selection of guns is a plus, though to some it may not be because you keep having to compare them. The graphics style is unique and something different to look at as it's in the comic book kind of style, some may think that the black lines can be quite ugly though. The game is quite lengthy especially with dlcs and if you do the 2nd playthrough option, so it's a good game for killing time. The game is mainly FPS, I don't think there is that much RPG stuff to it, there's the leveling up thing, which really motivates you to fight things repeatedly, because your character will get stronger over time and there's the screens with lots of text to read, such as the inventory and shops, this can take sometime to get used to and it also can be quite tedious to look at, particularly if you're not into RPGs."
14201,Ridiculously FUN!
14202,"Quote from the game's theme song - ""There ain't no rest for the wicked 'til we close our eyes for good"".  This is an excellent game any way you play it.  Excellent single player and excellent multiplayer.  It doesn't matter what platform you play this game on.  It's good on any platform.  The Underdome expansion is a must have because it has a bank that you can store items at.  The other expansions are good too but you got to have the Underdome.  I have this game on PC and Xbox 360 and I always save and load from the Underdome.  It's a nice hub to start at whenever you play it.  The Siren and Hunter classes are excellent.  The Soldier class is ok (but his turret could be much better than it is).  The Berzerker class is kinda pathetic but funny to use sometimes (punching things to death in a shooting game is pretty dumb though if you ask me).  It's a fun game that can be played for hours everyday.  There's alot of replay value to be found in this game."
14203,"Innovative Role-Playing Shooter game. Cool hand drawn graphics, nice RPG elements, and huge world to explore. All DLCs are good, they gives many extra gameplay (not just useless crap like hats and dresses).

My score: 10/10 (Must buy! Get the GOTY version, base game isn't worth it.)"
14204,"This is a fast paced, over the top shooter. You choose from one of four classes: Soldier, Beserker, Siren and Hunter. They all have unique skill trees and special skills. You then go on a quest to find the Vault, an ancient cave that only opens once a millenium. You are guided by a vision and along the way you meet crazy characters, mostly people who want to kill you. You will go against different bosses and mini bosses which keeps the game fresh. The gameplay is mostly first person shooting with a side element of exploring. The main selling point of this game is the amount of guns there are. How many you ask? Well, I roughly worked it out to be within 5000 and 20,000 guns. The graphics are very good and have a cartoonish look about them but you will need a decent graphics card to run the game. There is multiplayer which let's you and up to 3 other players share in the experience which adds to the replay factor. The only down side to it is the ending (no spoilers other than it sucks) 

9/10"
14205,Oynamadıysan eşcinselsindir
14206,"Very fun game to play with friends. Very challanging. Hilarious dialouge in both the game and it's DLCs. I'd reccomend buying this and playing throught the whole campaign with a friend, mostly because it's really tricky and it's boring without a compainion to adventure with."
14207,"Después de comprar éste juego, he tenido erecciónes más potentes."
14208,"Much like Fallout3, except with a wicked sense of humor that pervades every detail of the game. Also, random gun generation is ever so much fun."
14209,"A must get game, best played with friends."
14210,"Cell-shade grafiklerin post apokaliptik bir dünyaya uyarlanmasıyla ortaya çıkan çok iyi bir oyun olmuş. Pastel renklerle grafiklerini şenlendiren, silah çeşitliliğinin bolluğuyla kendini oynatabilen bu oyunu deneyin derim. Ayrıca içerisinde bol bol RPG ögeleri barındırıyor."
14211,DONT UNDERESTIMATE THE MADNESS ...BRILIANT GAME
14212,"Such a freaking great game! Great gameplay, leveling up capabilities, a TON of weapons, and hilarious humor. And I personally love all of the shoot-and-loot style of play. This definitely defines the RPS genre. [9/10]"
14213,velice dobra striiilačka
14214,Phenominal... Just...Phenominal.
14215,"If you like Diablo or any other Role Playing Games, you will definitely enjoy this game. Buy the Game of the Year Edition and be ready for Borderlands 2 to release September 18th, 2012!"
14216,One of the most interesting and fun games I have ever played also the second is coming out soon  so definitely get it
14217,Do you like FPS? Do you like RPGs? Perhaps you like to shoot bandits or alien creatures that has a tendancy to kill you? Team up with your friends and explore the vast lands of Arid and loads of other places. Why wait?
14218,"This game is way more fun that it should be. I mean when I really think about it, it is quite minimal and repetitive. The story is barely there. The NPCs may as well be talking trees.

But within these bounds Borderlands manages to be a whole lot of whopping fun. Those guns, oh the guns. The micromanagement. The exploding heads. Commandant Steel's eyebrows. PATRICIA TANNIS.

Oh right, and the drop-in multiplayer is such an excellent concept! WHEN it works. More games should implement this sort of cooperative drop-in multiplayer."
14219,"it is one of the most epic games i have ever played, there are TONS of weapons and hundreds of ways to play your character, and there are up to 4 player co-op which only makes it better. plus the art design is just amazing! im a big fan of the cell shading style.

14220,Co-op shooter. Its funny because there's no story but lots of bullets
14221,This has to easily be the most fun game I have played in a while. Humourous like L4D2 and  some really cool RPG elements make this much more than simple FPS. And I love FPS. The neat trick is that the RPG stuff is SO easy to do not as complicated like say Oblivion/Skyrim. You don't have to think too hard and can just relax and enjot single or co-op campaigns. The coolest thing though is the the multiplayer co-op seemlessly integrates with your single player campaign and you can keep progressing the same character on and offline. Awesome!
14222,"i have to say this games is like my favorite game of the year and it was made in 2009
i liked this game more than skyrim and thats anough to tell you that its a good game"

14224,Addicting first person shooter.   Like  WOW you keep getting better weapons and leveling up your character skills.   This is not a MMORPG but you can play with friends.
14225,"This is a really a fun game if you like repetitive expands of desert, equally repetitive gameplay, annoying characters and a storyline that rivals Dr. Seuss's ""Green Eggs and Ham""."
14226,"Not taking itself seriously is Borderlands' strong point. It's well written, surprisingly pretty, and if you're the type that likes levelling up, you'll enjoy this, because you do quite a lot of it. Randomised weapons is great, the DLC also actually adds to the game rather than just being extra missions, and it has moments of being quite amusing thanks to the bizarre set of rather well-characterized rednecks you deal with.  It's more fun with someone to play with, but very worth a playthrough if you can get it cheap."
14227,FPS + RPG = a damn good time.  I played 90% of this game with a friend in which we both find all kinds of exploits and are good shots in FPS games.  Borderlands was a game with a bad ending but overall a good experience and I'm excited for the second.
14228,"awsome rpg/fps game watch out for skags
"
14229,Its one of the oldest games in the world but still one of the best
14230,"If you wanna fell like Kenshiro of Fist of the North Star play this game and choose Berseker.
You will feel the YATATATATATAATATATAT!!!"
14231,"Great F@cking mother of all the awesomness' game.
Seriously, one of the best and most entartaining co-op FPS in the genre. 
And it's hilarious. 
A-wesome."
14232,Buy this game.  Buy it now.  Stop reading this and buy this game.  Go.
14233,"Borderlands' title art is a pretty accurate depiction of its gameplay: It drives you insane to the point that you try to blow your brains out, which have since turned into liquified shit, even if you don't have a gun."
14234,IT'S TIME TO PLAY! TIME TO PLAY!!!!
14235,"Right, so. Borderlands. A FPS RPG with a shit-ton of looting and a thing for mature humour (atleast in the Armory of General Knoxx DLC). The controls are your standard FPS controls, except with the added use of the F key to use your class's special ability. The look of the game is amazing, with it's unique look that makes it look like it was drawn or spray painted. The music is spot on fantastic and fits in well with the game. There's one thing tho. Borderlands is a game that shouldn't be really taken seriously, which I think they missed out a bit on in the original game, since there weren't many comical parts and it was more serious. Otherwise, if you get the DLC:s, my favorite one there is The Armory of General Knoxx, which really amps up the comical parts of the game.

Now to the main questions. 

1. Should you buy the game?

My answer; Yes. It is a game that is worth the money.

2. Am I going to like it?

My answer; I don't know, I guess you'll have to decide.

3. Should I buy and play the second game before this one?

My answer; No. Eventhough the second game might look tempting to buy, I would recommend buying and playing this one first before you go over to the second one.

4. Do you recommend the game?

My answer; Yes."
14236,"Fun FPS with four classes, light RPG elements and cel shading. UI panels slightly ugly in a LEGO kind of way. MMORPG-style quests."
14237,Barely anywhere near into the game and I can tell already that it's amazing. It's a must have so you must buy it.
14238,"Borderlands is a unique type of first-person shooter. It has very fast-paced but smooth gameplay, a wide variety of guns (not quite the bajillions advertised, but they're plentiful nonetheless) a quirky and always entertaining cast of main and supporting characters and side-quests enough to get your money's worth of game hours. Add to that a vast (mostly) free-roam world, and unique visuals that only this game could pull off, and you get a formula for an entertaining breath of fresh air."
14239,Why the hell haven't you played a game released years ago?
14240,aw3som gaem! wen i pray it 1 frin mny guns dat shot n i tak them!!!11! i rly enoy it
14241,still 5 star gaming awesomeness :D
14242,"Жалею что не купил эту игру еще в 2009. Брутальный экшен, интересная и оригинальная задумка вместе с ""РПГ"" элементами делают игру очень увлекательной! А целлшейдинг добавляет ""бордерлэндсу"" обаяния...."

14248,"Fun, hours and hours of fun and I played mostly offline not coop."
14249,"A decent game, it's quite humorous at times and is pretty fun to play. It is a game I recommend to play with at least one friend, playing by yourself just isn't the same. One thing I wish this game had was more variety in basically everything (weapons, enemies, etc.).

Game Rating: 7/10"
14250,Me and my niggas was playin this shit co-op shit hella fun breh I also tried playing single player shit was boring as fuck unless you playing co-op wit yo niggas don't get it
14251,"Grab 3 friends and enjoy the wastelands of Pandora.  A refreshing blend of Fallout 3 and Diablo 1, this game doesn't make any excuses; it tries its hardest to be fun and succeeds FAR more than it fails.  Really worth the time, just don't mind the annoying little dancing robot that you need to get quests from."
14252,HELP!!! I can't stop playing this game!!!
14253,"great awesome magnificent addictive game, one of the best of these last years :)"
14254,"fun game, addicting too, better if you play with friends"
14255,"Borderlands realizuje dokładnie to co obiecywano.

To doskonała strzelanina i całkiem niezły aRPG. Farmowanie przedmiotów, jak w każdej dobrej grze tego typu, wciąga i uzależnia. Godziny przelatują błyskawicznie, gdy płynnie przechodzimy od jednego zadania do drugiego, cały czas zabijając setki mieszkańców Pandory. Do ideału jednak troszkę zabrakło. Nieumieszczenie mechanizmu losowania przedmiotów pomiędzy graczami, skutecznie odstrasza od gry z obcymi, a koledzy nie zawsze są online :) Scenariusz jest tu przedstawiany tak niewyraźnie, że trudno się wciągnąć w historię poszukiwania skarbca. Ważny jest nie cel, a sama droga, a tą lepiej pokonywać z kumplami. Jeśli jednak masz grupę na którą zawsze można liczyć, dużo wolnego czasu i lubisz strzelać z gazyliona karabinów, to Borderlands jest grą dla Ciebie."
14256,"A bit slow to get in to at first, but once you do, it's utterly awesome. Get it!"
14257,"""Good Game"" I Will be buying BorderLands 2. Because ""There ain't no rest for the Wicked""."
14258,"Disappointing ending and tons of issues stemming from a rushed PC port are completely overshadowed by the humor, art, and fun of shooting so *many* rounds."
14259,"This game is amazing, especially if you play it with friends. A great co-op experience. Gameplay-wise, I like to compare it to Diablo 2, except as a first-person shooter, with guns.

9 / 10."
14260,"Exclusive game, RPG with guns -> ""What the hell?"", first time I played this.
But guns are almost same behavior, but its fun collecting/comparing them.
Various types of enemies.
Trivial story, with only one end. Quests are like go here and bring it to me....
Environment is little grey, Pandora is one big scrapyard.

pros:
-> 4 Playable classes
-> Over 17 mil. randomly generated guns, shields and other stuff
-> Lots of various enemies
-> Very long playtime
-> Playthrough 2 with stronger enemies and bigger Lvl up.
-> Coop with 4 other players
-> Last 2 DLC's rocks

cons:
-> Same behavior of guns
-> Not many coulourful environment
-> Same types of quests
-> Gamespy arcade matchmaking
-> Story"
14261,Why recommend this game?? ...... Because  there ain't rest for wicked...
14262,"This game is sheer bloody madness and I love every firefight.  Some of it feels like a grind, especially the T-Bone tollway, but my previous statement ""This game is sheer bloody madness"" holds strongly and I love playing it."
14263,Very Fun game 10/10 i recommend getting DLC too thats also very fun
14264,"A RPG game w/ FPS elements, and has some of the best upgrading elements around for weapons, health, etc

Very cartoony and interesting.
A must buy for RPG people"
14265,"Apart from what I mentioned here: http://amani-was-taken.livejournal.com/78968.html I can say that the online play and DLC didn't blow my mind. Maybe it's too late, maybe it never hit it off for PC, who knows? Either way, I feel that the optimal way to play this multiplayer is to have everyone in the party start off at the same level, or somehow locally.

I'm very much looking forward to playing the sequel."
14266,I love this game!
14267,Very addictive and highly recommended! Especially if you have someone to play with. The only problem I experienced thus far is frame hiccups in some places despite having everything on low settings. Seems to work fine in 720 resolution but lags in 1900.
14268,"There are games, that just take one part of your life from you. This, is one of thoes games. Graphics are comicish, which some people dont really like, but in my opinion, that is one of the charms of this game. Its addictive as well, the search for guns, the exploring, the monsters and characters you encounter in this game are fantastic. So, with a part of my life wasted to this game, I suggest you do the same. The time wasted wont be wasted for nothing, it will be wasted for awesome fun, and if you have 3 friends, who share the same opinion as me, the game will be 3 times more fun. Just get it."
14269,I don't understand why you wouldn't already have this game
14270,The way Borderlands merge Action FPS with RPG makes it very unique among the generic FPS out there. I will definetely be waiting for Borderlands 2 when it comes out and I recommend this experience.
14271,"If you're going to get this, get all the DLC, too.  Fast-paced goofy fun, not just a time-waster.  Love you, Claptrap!"
14272,fun with friends....
14273,Awesomeness!
14274,Wicked RPG-Action-FPS... Lots of fun!
14275,Must Play! End of story!
14276,One of those games you gotta get
14277,"es gude
"
14278,Pretty fly.
14279,"Really fun game, especially with co-op"
14280,"Guns and more guns.  I love this game.  But not because of the guns.  Playability, fun, and nastiness make it rounded for multiple play throughs."
14281,"This is quite possibly the best Action Adventure RPG I've ever played. The guns are awesome, the combat is amazing and the characters are... Well, let's put it this way, when you like one of the bosses so much you wish you didn't have to kill him, you know the devs did a damn good job."
14282,"Cali y El Dandee interpretan al Comandante Shepard, que junto a sus amigos, el rufián Adam Jensen y la compañía de danza interpretativa de Mallorca, forman el Equipo Gurren, una banda de piratas que lucharán, usando el poder de la espiral, contra Lord British y su ejército de stalkers, para así poder reconquistar el Strip y traer la paz al mundo entero. Pero durante su lucha descubren a un enemigo mucho mayor, que data de milenios de antiguedad y que amenaza con acabar con ellos y provocar el Gehenna (Que en murciano significa el fin del mundo).

Increible juegazo de Bethesda, con un guión increible, una jugabilidad sublime y unos gráficos espectaculares. Una compra obligada, 10/5."
14283,Such an addictive game : )
14284,If you like doing the same quests over and over again you'll love this.
14285,"Who said fun can't be had blowing up cartoony midgets?

It does take a while to get into, and the level scaling is a bit off, but aside from these and a few other annoyances [like when you're level 20 and you head back to the Badlands for a mission and level 5's start on you], it is absolutely superb.

If I had had the money, I would have bought this at it's full price absolutely no problem"
14286,Just buy it...just...do it all right? What else do you wanna' hear huh? You know it's good so just...just do it all right?
14287,Trop bon  jeux RPG shooting Action   en sennuis pas on vois pas l'heur passer
14288,"It is good...there's blood and skags and stuff, buy it. Woo!"
14289,I can't recommend this game enough. It's awesome fun with cool RPG elements combined with first person shooter - and it WORKS! Spent alot of time playing this.
14290,"игра просто БОМБА, рукомендую))) ждем 2-ю часть!!!"
14291,"Really awesome first-person shooter game where you can be a big brawler guy who loves shotguns or be a sniper or ANYTHING. Really boss: fighting monsters, and phycos"
14292,"This game is fantastic. The distinctive, vibrant visuals, the excellent build and performance, and the hilarious attitude all add up to a game that's more than worth the price. The co-op multiplayer is even more fun, and awards you with single-player progress. Don't just wait for the sequel- try this game. Try it and love it.

The pros: great gameplay, high replay value, excellent story and build, customizeable characters, almost infinitely variable weapon selection, huge DLCs, and more
The cons: Gamespy technology handling multiplayer servers, difficulties hosting if you have custom port settings, and audio difficulties with incompatible devices."
14293,I love this game! :)
14294,"Um dos melhores Co-ops que ja joguei , GAZZILLION guNS"
14295,Crazy wacky DLCs and quite good game-play
14296,a game with shit tons of guns and level upping. wunderbar!
14297,"Are first person shooters just, in general, way too exciting for you? Don't you think it would be more fun if you arbitrarily couldn't defeat certain enemies because the game has assigned them a higher numerical level than yours? Do you find it thrilling to be given numerous tedious sidequests that quickly grow irrelevant as you accumulate experience? Would long stretches of travel through vast, areas you've already explored improve your game? Isn't comparing a paltry helping of useless numbers a great way to choose between guns? Doesn't it suck how some games have coherent narratives with fulfilling endings?

If you answered yes to these questions, Borderlands is your dream game. If you didn't, then the developers are banking on the constant drip-drip-drip of loot + XP to hook straight into the reptilian part of your brain and trigger addiction before you realize that basically any other FPS would give more excitement per minute than this tedious grindfest set in a barren hellhole."
14298,"I highly recommend this game. if you like a game that will keep you entertained for a while and isnt too hard, get borderlands."
14299,"As a 1-player RPG Borderlands is pretty repetitive and sub-par compared to other RPGs.  However, it's the multiplayer you want to get this game for.  It's fast paced, the artwork's great, and the game play is pretty cool.  My biggest issue with Borderlands, though, is that all the pros are severely outweighted by the fact that this game is incredibly glitchy.  Quests Ive done previously are still labelled as not being finished, and then other quests are just impossible to compelte because the proper dialogue boxes won't pop up or the quest just will not trigger properly.  It's a shame, really.  I was going to reccommend this game to a lot of people, but the game breaking glitches are too much and happen way too frequently."
14300,"Better then expected from a FPS=>RPG.
If your into RPG like Fallout or Mass Effect this will feel a cartoon FPS
The comments are funny and witty.
It's a good game to get when its onsale."
14301,"Atmospheric. Casual. Its like something between the Hellgate: London and Fallout 3. If you like post-apocalypthic theme, try this."
14302,Good game when you play with friends although the 16 million guns or whatever the number is helps too the dissappointing fact is they all look alike with differing stats. Personally I also found most of the guns to handle the same with very little difference between them :( some of the cinematics for the boss battles are beautifally done and will definantly make you LOL or say wow. The biggest issue with the game is GAMESPY why did they ever produce that crap it totally ruins the game and means its next to impossible to pair up with your friends half the time.
14303,It's very good game with a little bit humor like dancing robot. It's very good to play with friends but if you play alone it's not bad too.
14304,Its alot more fun with mates but still a MUST buy nevertheless!
14305,"Come on, Catch 'a Ride"
14306,One of the best games of all time!
14307,"Everyone who knows me knows I adore this game, and with good reason.  Perfect combonation of an RPG and FPS."
14308,"borderlands is an expansive RPS (roleplaying shooter) where you'll have plenty of enjoyment, with likable chracters, strong shooting mechanics in addition to strong RPG elements, the game has plenty of side quests and weapons to go through in addition to a nice open world with plenty of baddies to shoot on sight, the shooting and side quests to an extent can get a lil repetitive but as you progress, it'll start to get more exciting (esspecially when you face even more challenging enemies and bosses)  the AI is okay at most times, but can have some screw ups, plus the game has a nicely done 4 player co-op where you and 3 other freinds can drop in  and quest together, one major flaw though is that if you plan to do all sidequests you'll be going back and forth to previous areas etc but overall borderlands is a great experiance, is it perfect? no, but if you enjoy shooting and rpg blended nicely together, i reccomend this"
14309,Freaking awesomesauce
14310,"Classic 2K shooter with an unique cartoon style graphics. Even with the game's age it still looks and feels good to play, even 2-3 years on."
14311,This game is completely unstable on win x64 systems do not purchase.
14312,Страус счастлив
14313,"There's no other way to say it: I enjoyed every second of Borderlands and all of the DLC.  This franchise will, no-doubt, be getting more of my money in the future.

A must-have title."
14314,One of my best games on pc besides Reckoning :]
14315,"Ok so get this right, theres this guy, you can become that guy, that guy is either a guy or a girl guy right, and you shoot guys, and theres this clown girl guy, and other guys, and like a gorillian guns. its pretty cool guy. Morty said he regretted paying for it, but hes jewish."
14316,best rpgfps iv ever played to date the soldier class is bay far the best class for one reson...team ammo regeneration
14317,"If an RPG and a FPS had a baby, throw in some COOP and voila, you got Borderlands. Watch out for Midgets wielding shotguns and Skag Poo."
14318,Really fun and addicting game! I can see why it was 2009's game of the year
14319,Great game! Much more fun with friends as the difficulty gets harder and loot gets better.  This game won GOTY for a reason.
14320,"Highly entertaining, as long as you can play with a friend. Make sure you wait until it goes on sale and get the GotY Edition. Out of the DLC available, General Knoxx and Dr. Ned are worthwhile, but Moxxi's is more of a filler than anything else. Then again, if you love arena's you'll enjoy it. Give it a shot, you won't regret it."
14321,This is great fun. And it's a cell shaded shooter so hey.
14322,"Is only game why you heff to shot gun?
"
14323,"This game is awesome for Co-Op.  For a FPS, I feel it has its lulls then insanity which is lovely in my opinion.  Its visually intriguing reminds me of a comic book, some of the detail in the environment is quite extradorinary. The personalization of your characters is very effective, I have 3 sirens and do not play them in the same style even when it comes to guns. Now to the guns, oh what fun the variety of guns there are in this game and the stats are very easy to understand.  I do strongly recommend the DLC packages. Particularly the Underdome one with Madd Moxie, the vault is nice and the Underdome is very fun, kinda intense at times plus you get some sick weapons as drops. 

On a a very small downside, I can't stand the Berserker's action skill, he giggles, shakes the screen, and you must charge into the fray to use it effective and its frankly creepy. I tried dressing him in all pink and calling him Snookums and nope, he's still creepy."
14324,Midgets with shotguns. enuff sayd
14325,GOOD with friends and dlc
14326,best of the best)
14327,Lots of guns. Killing stuff. ROAD KILL! Whats not to like?
14328,Enorme
14329,"You will not find a better Shooting/Rpg Game on the planet, and that is a promise. Borderlands has got to be the most fun game I've ever played. From the billions of guns you can choose from (that's not an exageration), to the wide assortment of enemies and huge exciting wasteland, there's nothing to not like about it. the only game that could possibly outdo this game... is the sequeal being released this year!"
14330,Get the GotY edition for 7.49 right now or forever regret it.
14331,One of the best games i have and everytime i play it it still feels new
14332,"Buy it, it's awesome! Massive amounts of gameplay, awesome humor, and great multiplayer! Even the metascore supports this comment. :]"
14333,"I very much recommend this game.  It has aspects of diablo in that you're killing lots of bad guys, getting exp, leveling up, getting new skills and collecting lots of loot.  Don't play it for the story.  The FPS controls are very smooth, fluid, and fast.  You can't really go wrong with this title."
14334,This FPS game is AMAZING. If you dont have it - GET IT - Co-Op makes this even better
14335,Nice Gameplay and Claptraps!
14336,It was fun for the two weeks where I had something to do.
14337,"I bought the GOTY version for 5 buck on last year summer sales,good game diverse alot of weapon and mods worth every cent"
14338,"Even though this game is kinda old, I still love it! Tell me if you want to play I will reinstall ASAP."
14339,"What's that? You want a first person shooter with a leveling system that doesn't make you feel like you have cement blocks for feet? Well look no further! The speed of classic FPS gaming with the dynamics of a leveling system and character progression. 
Go fast as hell, blazing a trail with lead fury or trudge through, dragging your adversaries to their graves, one head-shot at a time."
14340,"This game is where its at for cooperative or single player RPG sandbox shooter.This game has arenas scattered throughout the world to if you feel like playing some deathmatch too.Theres 100's of thousands of different types of guns too kinda like Diablo with the loot system.This is one of my favorites.

***** Five Stars *****"
14341,+1
14342,"I bought this to play with some friends and I am definitly getting my money's worth. I don't know if I feel the game holds up as a standalone FPS style game but its semi-open world feel with the loads and loads and loads of guns makes the multiplayer fun and enjoyable, definitely worth multiple playthroughs on each character type."
14343,"Man, when will I get tired of new guns ??? This game is a serious WOOT-fest  !!! Totally recommended for those waiting for Diablo 3 ... great game . I kick myself for ignoring it for more than a year."
14344,Spent countless hours on this game. It eventually got boring around the 30 hour mark because the story tends to be dull at certain points. Overall an amazing game!
14345,"A fascinating study on the implications of advanced AI's being used en masse in a future world. These robots, forced into menial labor for apparently no compensation, regularly demonstrate high levels of self-awareness  - including a perception of pain and an understanding of their own mortality. The increasingly pointless and repetitive interactions on the behalf of the player with these poor virtual souls clearly outlines the innate moral dilemma with developing robotics: as machines become more and more human do we begin to lose our own humanity?

Also there are a lot of guns."
14346,After 108 hours of playing (so far) - I'm still not bored with this one. A real gem.
14347,"Too janky to enjoy. Got a bad case of console port right down to locking up for 15-20 seconds at a time when alt-tabbing/no windowed mode. When it decided to leap me ahead 5 levels and give me no points for 4 of them due to a bug single player was out, and could not connect to friends thanks to the amazing black magic of Gamespy.

Add in that you have to manually install half the DLC and the permanent stigma of ""Duke Nukem Forever Early Access"" being stained on my account and you can kinda see just how much nobody cared about this platform when making it... which is why I don't care about the game. Took 4 hours to install the 12gb beast, and 37 minutes to uninstall."
14348,"Amazing. Fucking amazing. Albeit a bit dull if played single-player, it becomes a masterpiece when played with friends."
14349,Never once in this game does a psycho shoot himself in the head and say BORDERLANDS
14350,Borderlands 2 is gonna killlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
14351,"Great fun with friends, but way too much walking.
Quite worth it, if you don't mind the plodding between missions."
14352,Imagine if Fallout 3 had a cooperative playable campaign.
14353,"Loads of fun with friends. Story sucks serious ass tho, but that's not what it's about. It's about the experience of leveling up and kicking the ass of some badass badguys.  Just as long as you have some friends to do it with :D. 8/10"
14354,"FPS-RPG hybrid, so you're in for a treat! Great graphics and with awesome multiplayer, you can't miss! Tried one of the DLC's with a friend, and well... Felt a bit... boring..."
14355,"There's honestly not a lot of substance to this game, since most of it is running or driving around doing errands for people you don't even know. However, the cel-shaded graphics look quite nice (if you can deal with the too-small-for-PC field of view) and it's pretty fun to watch numbers steadily get a lot higher. If you happen to like collecting shiny objects, then Borderlands will have you covered for ages to come."
14356,"I don't know.  There is plenty of shooting things.  The  game apears visually beautiful.  And the sound is  definitelly atmospheric.  Oh yeah, and there is a metric shit ton of guns...but...the world of ""Borderlands"" feels extremely barren.  In places (settlements) where you get missions there are huts and buildings but no people.  You get missions from robots/buletin boards mostly.  Where are all the civilian inhabitants of this environment?  With the emptiness, despite the clearly obvious effort that has been put into everything, this world feels incomplete and in essence boring.  I want to love this game.  But it is just soooooo empty."
14357,"Now this was a surpisingly brilliant game...I really enjoyed the campaign and with all the DLC your'll get hours of gameplay...A bit slow at the beginning but once your hero is high lvl, massive killing fun...haven't tried it in coop yet but can imagine it being real fun
Rating 0-San Andreas...I give this game a whooping huge score of 9+"
14358,Постапокалиптический кооперативный шутер с механикой Diabolo. Если не испугались - покупайте. Игра исключительно для кооперативного прохождения с друзьями
14359,"Diablo FPS. loot, more loot, and more more loot. + of course fun.  Anti-climatic ending, but who plays a game like this for the ending?"
14360,"Had a lot of fun and spent many hours on this one, really good and lasts ages especially with DLC. Lots of action and good story with RPG elements, plenty of new missions always popping up to keep you busy. Its also good on co-op with a friend, great game."
14361,"This game is AMAZING to play with a group of friends, seriously one of the best co-op experinces I've had in a long time. 

The story isn't amazing and the end is rageable, but the gameplay is super fun, there's TONS of fun guns, and you feel like a badass pretty much all the time.

The stylized cartoony aesthetic fits well with the sprit of the game and the DLC is really solid.

Go buy this game, grab some friends and shoot sum gunz! :D"
14362,"Borderlands relies almost exclusively on fetch quests in order to move its anemic plot forward. Much has been said about the many guns which can be collected in this game, but ultimately all the guns fall into one of six types: shotguns, sniper rifles, revolves, pistols, machine guns, and assault rifles. These guns can have added effects like electric shocks, fire damage, etc. None of this makes for as exciting a time as you'd imagine, since the action basically amounts to just watching a health bar drain, horrible AI go through primitive motions, and whatever effect your gun possesses being shown on the enemy in a rather crude way.

There is no reason to play this game on your own, as its appeal largely consists of one-upping your friends in terms of level and weapon statistics. That's it."
14363,"The greatest game in the last 4 years. Like Fallout but better. Nice graphics, and lots of Humor. It is perfectly balanced, I'm sure glad I got it! 97%"
14364,"It's a big game, and satisfying all the way through, and lots of DLC to make the game even bigger. It's one of the more unique first-person shooters I've played, gameplay-wise and stylistically. Loads of guns, although they do share a lot of technical aspects between them. Also, enemies drop guns all the time, and you have hardly any inventory space to keep them all in, even when you upgrade it to maximum capacity. I used a hex code editor to give me over 65,000 inventory slots, and have horded every gun I've seen since. Also, you cannot customize your character's looks very much at all, but their skill trees are very well-made and you can develop your character into any of your preferred playstyle and strategies. The game is even better when played with friends, but I found it very enjoyable playing solo as well. One thing though: friendly NPCs and towns are very dull. Overall, this is a great blend of action FPS and open-world RPG. Give it a shot if you like either of those things."
14365,If you don't buy this game you will never forgive yourself.
14366,"IMPORTANT: This game requires a resonably good and consistent connection to play online coop. It supports LAN play, and I was able to exploit this using the now-defunct EVOLVE service to play with a friend who would otherwise have connection issues. He still had to periodically reconnect due to desyncronization.

Original review: People seem to love or hate Borderlands. I don't understand the hate, unless people misunderstood what they were paying for- Gearbox games seem to get a lot of that. It's true, much of the game's plot was cut out in development because they couldn't make it fit with the gameplay. And yeah, it gets old after a while. But Borderlands makes grinding and loot farming fun in a way it really shouldn't be- and that made me love the game. Its got a lot of style, and it's great fun to play in co-op, especially split-screen on a console. I love the characters and setting, even if a lot more could be done with it- something the sequel might address. But I had a lot of fun playing Borderlands. And in the end, I think it was really just about the guns. Lots and lots of guns. There ain't no rest for the wicked, but who's got the time? There's more bandits to shoot and loot to grab.

I recently replayed Borderlands once more with friends, for what was probably the forth time or so. This time I played Lilith, and she is by far my favorite of the original vault hunters. The game has aged relatively well, though it still bears some of the odd trappings of 00s era shooters not seen the sequels."
14367,Opening...and...OPEN!
14368,Shit this is fun
14369,"FPS meets RPG with amazing replayability, the gear and replays system reminds me a lot of diablo games."
14370,"If it isnt the best of the best, it isnt borderlands"
14371,"Very fun, always more to do and find."
14372,"If this game lacked co-op it would be awful.  Played in co-op, it's a blast.  Can't wait for Borderlands 2"
14373,"My favourite instalment of the series. Gritty, desolate space western. Significantly less of the obnoxious memeyness that the rest of the games had. 9/10"
14374,"Borderlands combines elements from a lot of genres, you've got a little racing here and there, you've got your first person shooter, and then you have your MMORPG style questing. If you like first person shooters, I think you'll have fun with this.

The most important thing about Borderlands would have to be the weapons. Everything from assault rifles and high powered revolvers to missile launchers and guns that can set your enemies on fire are avaliable in this game, and the ammount of them is almost infinite.

It's marketed as a multiplayer game, but it doesn't handle long distance ping well as it uses server side bullets. This means your friend can fire a whole 1.2 seconds before the bullet actually deploys, missing the target completely without aiming at your own feet if you need to backtrack.

Another thing might be the slightly unfair level guarding. Anything two levels above you recieves recieves so little damage you couldn't hope to kill it. Thus forcing you to powerlevel."
14375,"IF ANY OF YOU WERE KILLED TOMORROW, I WOULDN'T GO TO YOUR FUNERAL CUZ I'D BE IN JAIL FOR KILLING THE MOTHER FUCKER(S) THAT KILLED YOU!

14376,"One of my favourite games: it doesn't have the best story but it's extremely fun. Love the art style, and love the feel of the characters and guns."
14377,Amazing
14378,KAUFENNNNNN!!!!
14379,Diablo with guns. Endless replay in order to get the best weapons. Best with friends.
14380,Very Very Epic game !!!
14381,"There is very few games which have kept me playing for over a month of ongoing game play. 71 hours of game play in this so far, and still (with the DLCs) I am finding this game addicatively enjoyeable. It is World of Warcraft, FPS, modern, and without the issues of ongoing fees! I really enjoy it, enjoy the story, and can not wait for Borderlands 2 to come out (I want better weapons!!).

There are some parts of the game you get frustrated, usually because you are running out of time (ie - have to go to bed for work the next morning - only 2 hours away now!) and you can't really quit because if you do you have to go back to the start and do it again.

However - there isn't many of them, so usually it is forgivable being the fact the game is so HUGE!

So - COME GET YOU SOME - it is fun! :D"
14382,"Hell, four player co-op in an open world, four different characters and a buket load of fun!"
14383,"Bad-ass co-op FPS action.  Mindless fun.  A self-described ""Diablo with a shotgun""."
14384,"I like it, But its WAAAY too short without the dlcs, so buy all the DLCS when u buy the game, else u will level to 58 and be bored."
14385,"""B""  An odd shooter with a lot of content but it all feels kinda mashed and recycled from other games.  Post apoc styling, but its really a sci fi story/environment, diablo esque random weapon attribute dropping is cool, as well as tree leveling system.  Story, multiplayer, variety, and hook to keep playing are of average quality at most."
14386,"Great graphics, however, a bit slow gameplay and quests are dead simple. There isn't lot to do around and getting from place to place could've been easier."
14387,"Best FPS RPG co-op, magic-box-of-stuff finding, loot management game ever.  Interesting looking, with a bajillion different weapons.  Shallow story which improves in the DLCs.  Sometimes repetitive missions don't take much away from the game as overall there is a lot to do.  If you want to go and shoot stuff with your friends in a futuristic ,sci-fi environment, while your OCD forces you to organize your inventory... again... then this is the game you have been itching to play."
14388,Skag killing fun
14389,Fun
14390,awesomeness is awesome
14391,"Some people might say that it an ugly game or that it lacks substance and if you ask them to elaborate they say something in the lines of:
""Oh, but look at Crysis from 2007"" or ""it plays almost like an RPG but where is the plot"".

In all fairness, they are not wrong. Borderlands is not a game you play for eye candy or for the immersive RPG setting. RPG elements basically involve a skill tree + go kill x or get y kind of quest system with some very shallow hints about, well... everything else :)

But this where its shortcomings end. I mean really! It plays very well, throws hordes of fairly dumb enemies at you and gives you an absolutely ridiculous amount of weapons to play around with. Throw co-op in the mix and you ll have a blast. Borderlands is just plain mindless fun with a skill tree :) 

So don’t go looking for something that is not there and you will have world of fun waiting for you!

7/10

14392,Online mode and all of it's functions like voice chat work without any lag unlike the PS3 version.
14393,Top Game AAA++++
14394,"There is no one way to really explain what Borderlands is... Some percive it as a shooter, fast paced in essence with all the basics such as headshots included for critical hits. Some see it as an RPG, quest based in nature, running from place to place to build the storyline until the end. I see this game as a 3D shooter version of Diablo. You have quests, you grind, you have levels, you have loot of different colors  depicting its rarity, trading, pvping, and you have progressive replays to bring your character to that high level through all this. All I know is it feels right. Amazing game experience!

14396,"What do you get when you mix Diablo and Shooters? This gem.

My only gripe is the multiplayer servers being handled by Gamespy."
14397,The first ever RPS That I ever played and fell in love with becasue of its comedic playstyle
14398,This is one of the best Diablo style cooperative first person shooter I have ever played.
14399,Excellent game! Very fun game to play on singleplayer or multiplayer.
14400,Diablo + Doom = w00t
14401,"The game is quite big, lots of quests which you can opt to do with your friends or solo. And yes the bazillion varieties of guns will make for quite some interesting kills. I had fun with this one playing with my brother, the DLC expands the story and quests a bit keeping you from getting bored once you become an unstoppable tank! I suggest you get the GOTY version."
14402,"Добротный экшен от первого лица с элементами РПГ. Приятная, как-будто вручную разрисованная графика, неплохой саундтрек, разнообразие врагов, 4 разных класса персонажей, безбашенный кооператив и самое главное - число оружия, стремящееся к бесконечности. Один из самых весёлых шутеров, в которые я играл за последние годы."
14403,"I really like the game, but I couldn't find the stupid cake."
14404,"Absolutely massive game. Visual style is interesting, though not very well pulled off. Mission variety is laclusture, as is boss and enemy quality and variety. While the designs for them are unique to the game (Masked midgets riding on monster dogs and such) you'll be seeing them again and again. Weapons are randomly generated so if you're a loot whore it's got that going for it. The 4 classes feel pretty distinct, though some are miles better than others.

Play it in coop. It's not even a 10th as good on your own."
14405,"awesome game very fun, and worth your time if you enjoy coop games
"
14406,"I enjoyed playing through this at first with a good friend, but after buying the DLC and having a lot of problems activating it, I played it and felt like the game was just one massive grind without much of a sense of reward. Decent weapons are few and far between. 

Not a bad shooter, but kind of shallow."
14407,"Yo dis shit is off da hook

If you like pounding meat muppets, look no further."
14408,"Very nonlinear gameplay allowing you to advance the story line or go off after bounties on each in game day, or just go out and run things over with a car ala Carmageddon, the expansive amount of weapons keeps it feeling fresh and the claptraps are in the background enough to not be annoying"
14409,This game has an amazing soundtrack.
14410,Get four friends. Buy the GOTY edition. Play. Abandon reality.
14411,OCHE годная
14412,"7 Years, still going strong. It's got the OG BORDERLANDS feel to it BORDERLANDS 2 just doesn't deliver."
14413,"Fumettoso, ignorante, cazzarone, ironico. Una bella boccata d'aria dagli fps più seriosi. Divertentissimo :)"
14414,"I could not more highly recommend this game! I was turned on to this game by a close friend, and was initially doubtful I would enjoy it. More than 50 in-game hours later (I am an uber-completionist with this type of game), I still can't get enough. Check out any number of online reviews, if you have any doubts, then PLAY THIS GAME! Also, make sure to keep an eye out for Borderlands Game of the Year (GOTY) packs, which include all the downloadable content (DLC) on Steam, as it occasionally goes on sale. Have fun out there!  : )"
14415,Une petite merveille d'originalité au gameplay bien rodé dans un univers déjanté. Un FPS/RPG impropable et prenant ... et non censuré.
14416,"I've seen Some Bad Reviews for this Game, But that's rating the single player. I'll admit that this game isn't it's full potential on single-player, But when you are playing multiplayer via internet or even better Lan, This game is a Must buy for Gameplay, Co-Op, Story and a lot more, It's Definately worth the 30 Dollars, As it's a Must-Buy now for any FPS or RPG Lover.

Overall: 9/10 Almost Perfect, Just not quite there yet, Still Great Though."
14417,Great huge game with 17 bazillion guns
14418,Fuck this series dudes.
14419,"It's essentially FPS Diablo. It's flawed, but fun. The enemy variation is thin at best, the entirely random drop system is retarded, the music and environments are incredibly bland. The dialogue/writing might as well not even be there for as much as anyone cares about it. 

If you don't have 2-3 other people to play this with, don't bother."
14420,If you want your fun online co-op game here it is for you its worth the price
14421,"Classic Mad Max inspired FPS postapocalyptic wasteland, weaponistas will love it.  
Excellent badass boss to slay at the finale. 
Filled with bizarre quests, and npc's to kill, but it's best for killing time...  Your time...

The way to dusty death...  a walking shadow, a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  

UFF"
14422,"If you like the Diablo / Hellgate London style of RPG (go out, kill monsters, collect treasure) then you'll love this. Its really pretty with stylish graphics and imagery, great soundtrack and the multiplayer co-op works really nicely. The problem for me was that it was just a bit same-y. The mission are all the same ""Go here and kill someone"" or ""Go here and collect this"" and there wasn't any real variety. It's very much a hack and shoot to get enough gold and xp to buy the next upgrade, but without caring about the characters. So points for the looks and style, but black marks for repetivness and lack of depth. My score 7/10"

14426,FPS＋RPGという形は最近よく見ますが、その中でも特に両要素のバランスがとれているゲームだと思います。武器の性能は会社の特色だけに留まらず属性効果や、レアには更に特殊効果がついていたりと武器選びに困る程種類にあふれています。難点は「強い武器」がある程度決まってしまっているところ。RPGの宿命ですね。
14427,"never buy any game on steam shop, because it's damn slow at initialize game"
14428,the flying monkeys gives borderlands 4 wings out of 5!
14429,"I approached Borderlands with mxied feelings: 'the child of RPG and FPS', that's what the advertising said. Could this work out? The simple answer: Oh yes, it can!
Borderlands is fun to play in singleplayer, but it really begins to shine in cooperative play with up to 4 players. The 4 different and well balanced classes are fun to experiment with, each class with 3 skilltrees (comparable to MMORPGs like World of Warcraft). And the variety of available guns is impressive, maybe even comparable to Diablo 2's item generator, as it works in the same way of generating random stats for each item you pick up. This ""farming factor"" and the very special atmosphere (a mixture of classical Western and post-apocalyptic scenarios) make for a great game with lots of ironic jokes. Even the achievements, like Pandora-dog Millionaire, are mocking other games or movies. Brilliant title for players who enjoy a good cooperative shooter."
14430,Loot like Diablo in a first-person shooter? Sign me up!
14431,"Surprisingly good though after awhile it can get tedious but if you are playing with friends the fun can last quite awhile. It's a looter shooter styled game where you blow up stuff, get new gear and decimate bosses while uncovering new crazy npcs."
14432,"Somehow more than the sum of its parts. Fun in single player, but exponentially more so in co-op. High quality DLCs add longevity."
14433,"Gearbox really hit one outta the park here. Borderlands is definitely a wide-open-sandbox-FPS-RPG-thrillkiller that will stand the test of time. Notable not only for its robust weapons system, class system and edgy art design, but also for the engaging storyline and world-building presented over the main quest and multiple DLCs. With a hotly anticipated sequel sure to have more people coming back to the world of Pandora, it's a good time to buy, download and jump into the life of a dangerous mercenary on a far off planet of death."
14434,Awesome!!
14435,rpg랑 fps를 합쳐놓아서 정말 재미있습니다 후반엔 약간 질리지만 멀티플레이가 있어서 친구들이랑 함께하면  잼서요
14436,go for it try it yourself:)
14437,A fun and very stylish game which lets you play as one out of four different characters set loose on the planet Pandora to raise hell among its inhabitants. Get yourself together with three friends and play this game co-op and you are in for the ride of your life. Plus the fact that the game has more than a bazzilion guns makes for the icing on the cake.
14438,FPS RPG with D2-style randomized loot. God damn we have a winner.
14439,best game ^^
14440,I highly reccommend this game. it is one of the most well built games of its time and i cant stop playin it!
14441,Play this game.  Play it with a friend.
14442,Im dancin. Im DANCIN!
14443,"One of my absolute favorites!  Multiple replays with each character!
"
14444,its a break from the run of the mill shooters
14445,Easily my favourite game of this generation.
14446,"GREAT GAME!

This game is very addictive, so beware before you buy :)

Good graphics, Good gameplay, Good questing.

I had not been in a gaming spree in a while but this game glued me to the screen for a few days.

RECOMMENDED!"
14447,awesome game!
14448,"Love this game, shooting everything, running it all over, and you can team up with mates to do it....good fun. :-)"
14449,8.5/10
14450,YOU NEVER SHOULD'VE BOUGHT THIS AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA PLAY!
14451,"Great coop game. Gadzillion variations of weapons.
It's like a story based MMO, but it's coop, and has that cartoony cell-shaded graphics you might remember from a few other games(for instance 13 - or XIII if you are picky).

Has some decent DLCs(although I strongly recommend The secret armory of general knoxx if you have to chose only one - best DLC IMO).

Did I mention it has a gadzillion gun varieties? Yes? Well that makes it two gadzillions!"
14452,"One of my favourite games. Worth the buy, especially at the price it's going for now."
14453,"Super godt RPG, selvom jeg aldrig er kommet igennem det :D!"
14454,awesome
14455,Borderlands is a great blend between a FPS and RPG.
14456,very good game def. a bang for your buck lol
14457,Great game especially coop mode
14458,"Not exactly what I was expecting... In fact, it's better than that. This is a must have, since the game has gotten so cheap. You'll have a blast, both offline and online."
14459,"Great game, have not had such shitloads of fun since Left4Dead in a Co-op shooter!"
14460,Great game
14461,"I like the game borderlands because... well guns, its one of the only FPS that im actually good at.
man i even found the corrosive dove and with brick's Masterblaster & Revenge skills, Your gonna have an OP time."
14462,6/10
14463,"do i need to explain how frieking bootleg abd epic this game is......

GO BUY NAO"
14464,A great co-op game.
14465,"Extremely refreshing game for any FPS, RPG fan. Really fun and messed up humor will be tickling your thirsty desire for quality games.
On the bad side - feels quite lonely, almost no music at all, uses GameSpy and NOT STEAM, and it's too easy if you complete all missions you get and some locations are poorly designed.
In any case. This is one of my favourite games due to its action, humor, unique look and HUGE AMOUNT OF LOOT. DLCs are really good, however  level scaling is messed up.

Borderlands 2 gonna come out in mid 2012 and I hope that it will be more polished."
14466,"easily my all time favorite shooter, unlimited guns, fun abilities, great characters, insane and obscure refrences left right and center, and if your feelin lazy use WIllowtree tho i only use it for gun making cause it be boring with everything handed to you on a platter"
14467,"BUY THIS GAME!!
 It's a changeling, fun, well made game. The blend of FPS and RPG is great. The world is almost a open world, with lots to do and see. The characters are well made and the weapons are endless; allowing for every player to customize their load out. The Dune buggy is VERY fun and if you park it in just the right spot, you can take out some major bad guys wit it easily. The game is fully playable as a solo or team; solo is harder and requires taking your time and REALLY planing out your attacks. Otherwise you can get overrun. I strongly recommend this game. It's not as ""hardcore"" as other shooters out there, but it's not suppose to be."
14468,"Borderlands is fantastic and always on sale. Don't buy it unless it's on sale, but DO buy it. It's great."
14469,Favorite co-op. Amazing art.
14470,This game is good.Now give me my coal.
14471,"Loved this game and all the DLC...except for maybe Mad Moxxi, which was really just a big dissapointment cause I loved her character otherwise."
14472,"Simply put: Buy this game. The story is engrossing, the gameplay is fantastic, it has awesome replay value, the DLC is fun, and it makes for a great LAN game as well.

I bought this a year ago and spent my holiday break playing online with some close friends. Most gaming fun I had experienced in a long time. There is no good excuse to pass this up."
14473,"Excellent shooter/RPG.  I had great fun playing through the adventure mode on this, and with essentially infiinite weapon customization, you'll have plenty of fun just messing around.  If you find it on sale, a highly recommended buy!"
14474,"Cartoonish imagery works well, with a great plot and sense of humor.  Great FPS, and Diablo-style weapon selections.  A must buy."
14475,Can't wait to play this!
14476,Fun game. Doesn't take itself too seriously. Beat it pretty quickly though. I'm just doing this for the gift pile thing.
14477,really awesome game
14478,"Good fun, if you play with friends"
14479,"Hey, you seen my gun?"
14480,I initially thought this game was going to be laughable because of the graphics.  However once I got into the game the graphics became part of the gaming atmosphere and made the game actually fun.  It was a nice change of pace.
14481,"Really fun FPS, and if you love RPGs, it's even better. If you've played Diablo, you'll love this game. Millions of guns with different attributes will keep you hooked for hours trying to find the next best weapon.

To top it off, 3 other players can join you for the fun."
14482,Best RPG Co-op game of all times!
14483,bom demais
14484,derpy
14485,Pew pew!
14486,Love the game hope the new one will be as good :)
14487,Pure loot grabbing co-op fun.
14488,Do you like guns? Do you like finding loot? Do you like leveling up? Do you like co-op? This has all of that and quests and characters with personalities and a great anmostphere on the world of Pandora. Get it and hit me up.
14489,"Zajebista (jak masz z kim grać) , musisz ją mieć!"
14490,"It's Borderlands. And if you have ever wanted a quality shooter, a quality RPG, or even just a straight-up good game, it's what you want-- Even if you don't know it yet."
14491,More fun now with co-op since my bro started playing the game.
14492,"Good game, crappy ending, but fun to play."
14493,"A bit of a hit or miss game for some people, but for me it's one of the best co-op games out there. If you ever need a partner in Pandora's wastelands, I'm your man."
14494,"Very fun game. Great story line, and if you purchase with the DLC, you'll save money and be entertained. You can play it through 4 times with all 4 characters!"
14495,LOVE DAT GAME
14496,Fantastic coop experience. Lovely art style and sense of humour.
14497,Baw chika baw waw!!
14498,Best FPSRPG.
14499,I thought this game was well done and provided for hours of entertainment. The DLC was good too... well most of them
14500,"as an entirely fresh take on the subject, borderlands is a game every action RPG fan should try out."
14501,The greatest game i have played
14502,no memes
14503,"Feels kinda like Diablo FPS since the objective of the game is to farm for the best items. There's a story in there somewhere too, if you care about that sort of thing."
14504,"They don't call it a Game Of The Year for nothing. This is by far the most perfect blend of a FPS and RPG. You get the feel and power of the weapons while still having the game changing effects and skills of an RPG. Worth every penny in my books. Single player is a simple joy but multi-player is where the real entertainment value is. Difficulty scales with the number of players. More friends, more frienemies (Friendly enemies to kill. Warning: Frienemies may not be so friendly). 

This is your quest to find the vault, you'll hear it mentioned many times as you search for it. Whether you find it or it finds you, you will have to play it to find out!"
14505,one of the best 3rd person shooters i've ever played!
14506,Freakin Sweeeeeeeeet
14507,That's Game is AWESOME!!!
14508,=win
14509,"Awesome game, Will keep you hooked for hours on end  with its constant action and dark humor. Buy it!"
14510,"Quite a good game. The plot starts out slow-paced and meandering, but the entertaining characters and interesting missions will easily keep your attention. Towards the end, a compelling plotline develops naturally out of what you've been doing all along, and carries you along to the climax."
14511,"The game so nice, I bought it twice."
14512,"A good Action-RPG for shooter fans wanting to try RPGs or Vice versa. The menus could do with some work, and The farming in playthrough 2 gets Annoying, and has a slightly dissapointing ending, but otherwise, an amazing game."
14513,Cell shaded hilarity - fun for the whole family and the DLC doesn't suck. Win.
14514,Great art design and setting. The RPG elements hardly hinder the FPS elements. The game can be very drawn out and more like a sandbox if you play it that way. The co-op definitely complements this. Best played with a group of trusted friends.
14515,"Repetitive pewpew lootloot, possibly addicting."
14516,The twist ending is a total bitch.
14517,"Solid game, well worth its cost and amazing start to an amazing series of games."
14518,솔직히 지루햇다
14519,"Really good Derping game! 

9/10 Squidesss"
14520,"Although repetative, on paper (and often in realilty) this is a great game.

I like shooters, but sometimes they feel pointless to me, and since I am not a hardcore player, miss the rpg elements such as levelling up, which help you to improve even if you don't actually improve, and make the game feel less pointless.

Rpg's I love however level grinding (which I don't really do) or even the battles that you cannot avoid can be tiresome and repetative. Secret of Mana is one of the only games in which random encounters are not annoying (think gameboy Zelda style but with magic and levelling and a lot more weapons).

Borderlands combines the good parts of shooters and rpg's and eliminates the bad. It also looks amazing with its cel-shaded style, although the landsape is very beige and bland (purposefully) but still I miss my Secret of Mana aesthetics.

Despite sometimes feeling like a waste of time (boring storyline) it is addictive. I'm glad I bought it on sale though."
14521,this game is more epic than a turkey on christmas eve
14522,"Like treasure hunting, goofing off, and shooting stuff in the face? Look no further!"
14523,"one of my favorite games ever, fantastic single player, even better multiplayer."
14524,"This game was pretty sweet, but i wouldnt join into a game where people are a higher level because you will never find a quest to do because you will have 900 million unlocked but other then that great game =)"
14525,"A great co-op game to play with friends with addictive Diablo-style questing and looting and a ""wacky"" sense of humor that was more funny at the time than it is now. A story that's so light it's hardly there and some clunky console-focused mechanics are annoying, but the core gameplay is good enough to mostly overcome that.

Running around and shooting stuff until it dies and loot pops out has never been so fun.

Oh, the guns in BL1 are a million times better than in BL2. Much more interesting and random."
14526,fun as hell for co-op
14527,"Super fun game, limitless hours of gameplay, tons of replay value, hundreds of quests and thousands of gun mixtures. All around amazing game, and not to mention; multiplayer! 5/5 <3"
14528,This game is truely a work of art. Both the gameplay and texture of the world are amazing! Cant wait for Borderlands 2!
14529,Really good game. Some fun weapon combos. Had fun making my own weapons
14530,"rly good but not perfect, wait for borderlands 2 then buy that"
14531,"This game is easily one of the most highly addictive, fast paced, and violent games I've ever played, and I loved every second of it. Definitely worth buying."
14532,This game is incredible! One of the best open world FPS RPG I have ever played
14533,"Addictive, but best played multiplayer."
14534,I don't like it....I LOVE IT!!
14535,Pretty Dece
14536,Mordecai is awesome :3
14537,cool Co-op game it is really worth the bucks
14538,One of the funnest FPS games ever :) What's more to love? You get to shoot shit and run things over ;) I can't wait for Borderlands 2!
14539,The best mix of FPS and RPG ever developed... by far!
14540,"Very good game, with an awesome story!"
14541,The one real reason why you should definately buy this game is the awesome co-op campaign.
14542,I reconmend this :D
14543,Great game is like a FPS shotter but with some touchs os RPG games it is awesome if you like shotting games
14544,dis guy leik totly haz uh fingr gun 2 hiz hed n' it goez b00m
14545,"Despite the fact that this game has been out for a while, it's still an experience worth savoring.  Any FPS fan should grab it while it's on sale.  For less than $15, you can get the entire Borderlands experience, and that is plenty of ""bang"" for the buck."
14546,"This game is absolutley amazing. Tight fps controls combined with a pseudo open world with quests and loot galore. Play with your friends for added fun and enjoy exploring the world of Pandora! With over 500,000 guns, this game will keep you busy for hours, a must buy in my opinion and make sure you get the GOTY version!"
14547,Great game!
14548,Buen juego
14549,"Fun 2 play game, never gets boring, has comic-like graphics which is looking funny, great and very original. Very big maps (semi-open world), cities, dozens of enemy types and very very many guns! (I've read somewhere that this game has over 4000 weapons!). The game is worth the price, amazing game! Buy it! Seriously!"
14550,Amazing FPS with an RPG element. Very fun to play with friends.
14551,"It's not just about the guns! Amusing writing, a distinctive atmosphere and well-structured levelling combine to make this an enjoyable romp. THe major caveat is that the world can be empty without friends, so utilise the jump-in-jump-out co-op system where possible."
14552,It's really good.
14553,Really good game to play with your friends for hours of fun. You can level up offline and then play online and help each other get better. Really good buy! Totally worth it.
14554,It's like Diablo but an FPS.  Item collecting is like WoW except guns. Worth your dollars
14555,I love it and can't wait till Borderlands 2
14556,"Excellent game, you need to own this one!"
14557,fun while playing with friends
14558,"Fantatsic game, feels an FPS apocalyptic Diablo, with lots and lots of lots of guns. :)"
14559,Fallout 3 with multiplayer.
14560,"Very cool shooter with RPG elements.  Multiplayer is *much* more difficult, but it's also a lot of fun.  Get this game!"
14561,This game has one of the best loot systems in a while.
14562,"Nothing to say, if you like online games, borderlands is a must-own."
14563,Fantastic Game. Enjoyed it from beginning to end.
14564,Get the loot!
14565,This is one of the best games I have ever played.
14566,The ending is as bad as the game is good (it's really good)!
14567,ALL I DO IS WIN
14568,The Diablo of FPS.
14569,"Excellent combination of shooter and rpg. Each of the 4 characters can be built in several ways, lending great replayability."
14570,"Borderlands is a massively enjoyable game. You play as one of four playable characters which each have their own set of skills they can choose which may affect your character or a gun type within the game. The characters won't stand out as much as later games as they added very little personality into the character within the game.

The game shines when playing multiplayer with friends however the connection can be poorly when playing with over one friend as the next code isn't great compared to the enhanced version. The good thing about the original over the enhanced version is there is no golden chest which makes finding loot unless.

The guns within Borderlands aren't your typical guns they can range from a wide range of distinct elements shot to them. The DLC content mostly is okay with Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot being the weakest of the DLC and Dr. Ned's Zombie Island being the best DLC."
14571,Definatly a must have game for RPG and FPS people alike. The unique gameplay and creative artstyle of this game make it very interesting and it is something you SHOULD try out!
14572,Great fun and replayability value. Best if played with others.
14573,Love this game probably in my top 10 favorites
14574,Este juego es excelente muy largo y entretenido para 2 o mas personas
14575,"Fantastic game, great shooting mechanic. Gets a bit repetitive towards the end. 4 stars out of 5."
14576,"Easily one of the most entertaining games ever. Grab some deodorant, take a gander at the fantastic art style, and jump into the world like Mad Max on steriods. Hey, don't be shy now, get you one!"
14577,epic
14578,"An interesting take on the RPG-FPS hybrid, Borderlands delivers an enjoyable experience for single player and for co-op. Don't expect a revolutionary story though - treasure hunters looking for a big prize seems all too familiar. The side quests and weaponry are varied enough to secure its entertainement value."
14579,This game is so fun I forgot i had it
14580,"Borderlands.
Takes the Fps genre and creates a Great game Out Of it. With highly customisable weapons and a wide variety you can always find something good to shoot baddies with."
14581,"""The cake is a lie"""
14582,"Just epic to play with your friends. If you haven't bought it yet, just watch for a Steam sale action. It'll be there cheap."
14583,Pura diversión!
14584,Runnan' around fast n' gettan kill stolen not getting buffs and LOOK AT ALL THESE WEAPONS I BETTER TAKE THEM FAST: The Game.
14585,"FUN. FUN. FUN.

Only with friends"
14586,"Amazingly fun game, shooter/ RPG love.  The RPG aspect is kinda short, but is still such an amazing game, I still play it to this day!  I even bought it twice, once for steam, and once for my xbox.  I am a dedicated Borderlands fan, you and must try it!"
14587,Is awesome sauce
14588,"One of the best games I ever played, tons of fun specially when you are playing with friends!"
14589,One of it's previllages is that has endless gameplay!!! The rest no need to be mentioned... but if I have to sum it up... then...I have to say it's an Epic Game!!!!
14590,"Very much recommend this game.  It's like playing a comic book and has a similar feel as STALKER.  The humor and dialog  is really good, and the graphics are outstanding."
14591,"Extremely varied weapon selection makes this game a nonstop adventure. Seamlessly blends RPG elements with FPS gameplay and succeeds at every turn. This game is not to be played solo. It's still enjoyable but the true beauty lies in co-op and multiplayer modes. While in Co-Op the PvE enemies get a boost to level, health, shields, etc but the drops are better than what you'd find alone. Even if you're lower level than your friends, tagging along will still get you some experience so Power Leveling is available. I actually do recommend it because there are some missions I found that may be too difficult for single players. 

TL;DR Version:
Lots of guns
Lots of shooting
Lots of fun!"
14592,"Awesome game. I can't say anythign bad about it :3 it's just great :D
"
14593,Best game for getting greedy about weapons with your friends
14594,"This game right here, I enjoyed. I'm sure you have it already though."
14595,Much better than console version 5 stars
14596,"May be the most enjoyable FPS i've played. Great solo, awesome with friends."
14597,"It's a loot-happy FPS with fantastic multiplayer support, more guns than the entire population of Texas, and it also  features a revolutionary gameplay design of an actual color palette and not another brown and gray generic military FPS color scheme."
14598,One of the first FPS that didn't give me motion sickness.
14599,I've been a fan of fallout 4ever and this game rocks! Kool weapons and enemies an lots of territories to discover.
14600,"I got this game on Christmas Eve of 2011 for 5$, the best 5 bucks I ever spent...
waiting for the Remastered version to jump in again!"
14601,Excellent both coop and single player :) Tons of replay value and a great looking art style
14602,"One of the best FPS/RPGs i have ever played. countless amounts of loot to find, endless amounts of fun to have."
14603,This game = AWESOME!
14604,第一人稱 RPG 遊戲，滿有意思的。 :D
14605,"What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said by others.  Simply put, it is awesome!  ""As if an RPG and FPS had a baby.""  You get a shooter that has leveling and stat distribution.  There are basic weapons and then those with elemental damage added.  You start off with two weapon slots and will increase to four.  It is true that the RPG elements can be somewhat lite at times, as there is only one skill per class, it is low on equipable items other than a shield, grenade mod, & class mod, and therefore there are no such things as set items.  
However, what they did they did well.  I like how the class mods not only have individual buffs, but also team buffs.  That way, everyone gets to take advantage of the Hunter's Scavenge Extra Items or the Soldier's Ammo Regen or Enhanced Clip Size.  And the difficulty in MP mode truly scales with the more players you have.
And for the newbs, don't worry, once you get your wheels the game picks up in speed as traveling becomes easier."
14606,this game is really good and has amzing graphics
14607,best fucking game ever yo
14608,If your looking for a fun game with an absolute TON of different guns look no further
14609,"Hilarious fast paced action and adventure. If you love the game itself, the DLC is just as great."
14610,"Крутая игра с супер геймплеем, кооперативом на 4х, кучей оружия и крови)"
14611,!!
14612,"Great game, even the DLC was awesome."
14613,This is one of my all time favorite games. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in RPGs and/or shooters.
14614,Best co-op multiplayer ever.
14615,"GUNS, GUNS, GUNS, GUNS, GUNS, and more GUNS."
14616,"AMAZING, you really enjoy this game with your friends, is a very competitive game and the DLCs packs are a really nice bonus on the GOY edition"
14617,This is ef-ing awesome!
14618,"A very good game, I've been playing this a lot and it's allways fun. A game that rewards exploring with treasure"
14619,So much hours played :). Diablo with GUNS!!!
14620,It's like Diablo with guns and FPS view. Good combination.
14621,"Fun, humorous game with lots to explore and well over 100 hours with dlc. And you get to play agian for even more time and harder enemies."
14622,"Очень рекомендую игру,так как она очень интересна."
14623,Enjoy it with 3 friends!
14624,"Everything in one package! 
Guns, blood and a lot of work.. what else do you need?"
14625,good play :)
14626,Game of the year. Every Year.
14627,ваще крутотенечка
14628,"This is an excellent example of the integration of the FPS and the RPG genre. Borderlands excells in gameplay yet lacks in the story department. In addition, this game was ported perfectly; so as long as you have a decent gaming rig, expect 60 frames per second with no stuttering or other technical issues. This is a great game that deserves attention from fans of either genre.

Gameplay: 18/20 ... AWESOME
Story: 5/10 ... POOR
Graphics: 5/5 ... PERFECT
Sound/Music: 4/5 ... AWESOME
Controls ... 5/5 ... PERFECT

Overal: 82% (37/45) ... GREAT"
14629,"FPS with RPG? This is the source of so many hours of great gameplay, headshots to psychos and brilliant story. Hours of fun and many other hours of fun in co-op! TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY! 10/10"
14630,"It's a very addictive game. The begining could be slow, but after awhile you just can't stop playing."
14631,Fantastic game with an extraordinary universe !
14632,its good
14633,정말 재밌어요!! 가끔가다가 오류만 빼면 ㅋㅋㅋ
14634,good shooter with some rpg elements
14635,"A lot of fun, especially as the game doesn't take itself seriously and the graphics just make sense!"
14636,"A little light on story, but co-op is an absolute blast."
14637,"You should really consider buying this car...  Stay with me here...  It's an '06 Camaro.  It has only 300,000 miles on it and an all new suspension.  The tires, brake system, and feul lines were put in new last month.  The interior is all new and it even comes with a free tree shaped smelly thing.  Only OVER NINE THOUSAND dollars! XD"
14638,Fantastic game / addons well worth a purchase
14639,"Cell shaded FPS, nice style, good control, great interface.  All around goodness."
14640,"Hours and hours of shooting fun, inbetween minutes and minutes of walking around though!"
14641,Fun to play with friends.
14642,"Guns, guns and more gun! If you love guns, then you're bound to love Borderlands! The game play is simply fantastic, the art style is great and did I mention the guns? :P"
14643,Good fun with 4 player co-op
14644,"Great game, They have a very dark sense of humor and the action is great"
14645,"A really good game, combining both RPG and FPS gameplay, and doing it right! We had fun running trough the large maps of this game and doing all quests we could find, but when you finish the game... you feel a bit disappointed, don't know why. Oh well, Borderlands 2 is coming soon :D"
14646,"this is a great game, good quality, love the sandbox-layout, makes for great entertainment. I rarely find myself bored in this game. 4/5!"
14647,If you like guns and semi entertaining boss fights then this is for you.
14648,Worth any price. Played for over 100 hours. So much fun!
14649,"Great, great game. I'm having lots of fun here!"
14650,Really enjoyed it. A truly awesome game and can't wait for the sequel. :)
14651,Jolly good fun
14652,"Yup
"
14653,Best Co-Op in World :)
14654,"Borderlands is a pretty awesome game.  Sandbox-like, although still pretty linear.  I mean I can roam around and kill anyone I want, but it's not as open-world as, say, Fallout 3 or Oblivion.  Good shooter with a gajillion guns due to the randomizer."
14655,"A competent FPS that relies heavily on grinding and multiplayer gameplay to keep things going. You can't fault this game for being short and it offers an interesting array of DLC once you've completed the main story, but you will find yourself getting bored after a few hours of playing alone.
I recommend this game to anyone interested in RPG/FPS blends that favour running and gunning over stealth and cover, but it does feel like an empty MMO most of the time."
14656,"Guns, guns, and more guns, baby!"
14657,"Really fun game. Random loot, four characters, great coop. Ending sucks though."
14658,"I am really enjoying the multi-player experience of this game.  It's set up very similarly to Dead Island in that you need to have equally-advanced characters both in level and story, so it's worth it to find a gaming buddy and go through it together.  Still, the leveling is very effective in allowing characters to really shine at their specialties, so there are lots of moments to look cool.  The story is eh, it's okay, the gameplay is pretty fun and the cars are a blast.  I like the art style a lot!"
14659,Hands down one of the best RPGs I have ever played! Despite lackluster sequels this is a must play!
14660,Love this game and would remommend to just about anyone
14661,"Hours upon hours of fun, especially with co-op. Funny storyline and great characters, also a never ending supply of LOOT!"
14662,"The graphics hold up well even after all these years, which makes me worried that BL3 will bring a jar-jarring change. But no matter what happens with BL3, this remains a terrific shooter/rpg-ish blend, with good controls and lotsa lewt. Downside? The main story endboss is such a disappointment and fails miserably in every way. Other than that, highly highly enjoyable.

Addendum: I will not be buying Borderlands 3 on the Epic store."
14663,An unusual graphic-novel style look makes this a nice break from 'realistic' shooter games.
14664,good game ok
14665,GOOD STUFF mad moxxi dlc isnt very good
14666,"Initially i thought it would suck, But after playing it, it becomes very easy to enjoy this game, it actually has a pretty enjoyable story line and the mechanics arent that bad either, This is a Diamond in the rough"
14667,"A nice blend of RPG and FPS with random loot drops and enemies that are just difficult enough to encourage teamwork. The special abilities are kickass, and each player gets to customize them when they level, making for interesting replay opportunities. The humor is a bit twisted, and so is the story. The DLC is downright awesome."
14668,Yup
14669,"Easily still holds up to replaying even after all these years and considering BL3's extortionate pricing model, is easily the better 'Bang for Buck' game"
14670,"Really fun co-op, combines shooter aspect and RPG aspect rather nicely (shiny new guns!). Get it if you're looking for a 2-4 player game with bros."
14671,"Such a fun and unique game, it's like a Diablo 3 FPS =D"
14672,HOLY CRAP HE'S KILLING HIMSELF ON THE FRONT COVER. HOW BADASS MUST THE REST OF THE GAME BE?
14673,"A great FPS, and a whole lot of fun with friends."
14674,I'd Border your Lands any day.
14675,"Enjoyed this game greatly, glad it stuck to pc game style vs the garbage pc ports from consols."
14676,"This game never ceases to entertain me with its unique art style, wacky humor, and addictive gun-lootin' gameplay!"
14677,"Excellent game.  A must have for anyone who likes first person shooters.  Like fallout, but without all of the unecessary tedium."
14678,"An amazing game for both single player and co-op. One of the best features is the guns; never ending gun combinations so that as you and your enemies level up, the guns get better too.  Campaign is lengthy which adds for many hours of entertaining missions and exploring :)"
14679,sweet
14680,"Great job of generating the atmosphere in this game.  Drags a bit in the mid-late game, though."
14681,Get the GotY if you can.  More hours of fun than you can shake a psycho at :)
14682,"Jogaço :D
"
14683,really fun game. best when played with friends around the same level as you.
14684,"다양한 아이템의 세계.....
욕심나신다면 당근 보더랜즈....더불어 템 앵벌이에도 강추~~"
14685,Lots of replayability.
14686,"I NEED AMMO, wait what?"
14687,"Playing this co-op is a must in my opinion, one of the best games i've ever played"
14688,"Definitely one of the most unique FPS games released in the current generation. Not much story here, or even very interesting characters, but there is PLENTY of action and beyond plenty of weapons. The gameplay is great and a sort of morph up between an FPS and an RPG which nailed it for me. 

It was a great break from the serious dramatic titles I normally delve into and served its purpose well as an action FPS/RPG. I definitely recommend this, especially at the current price."
14689,"I really like the game, but I couldn’t find the stupid cake."
14690,Was a lot of fun
14691,"Recommend to Your Friends
"
14692,"This is a good ""shoot 'em up"" game. It is fun and you can just pick it up and start playing. Lots of different kinds of guns with different features on them (sniper rifles, machine guns, pistols, etc). It is clever and fun, I think any fan of FPS would like it."
14693,"Great multiplayer game, you can just pick it up and play whenever."
14694,This is the first FPS that I've ever had an interest in playing. The graphics and intuitive gameplay are completely immersive.. Totally something to buy for yourself or someone you know who isn't very keen on gaming... LOVE IT!
14695,"hours of elemental weaponry goodness. kill everything, find the vault, wait for the sequel."
14696,"It's not great, but it's not terrible, either.  It's more on the border."
14697,Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of fun.
14698,"very fun game, even better with friends when you play co-opp. Lots of replay value."
14699,"Really Great Game, Kept me entertained for Hours, Still Playing well worth the investmest!"
14700,"One of my favorite recent RPG's. The shooting mechanics are good, there's tons of places to explore, and there's lots of DLC to expand it."
14701,"Plays like a cross between Doom and WOW.

Awesomeness."
14702,"I was very late to the race with this game, I finally picked it up during the steam holiday sale...

I was surprised by how fun it is watching those little experience points fly out when you shoot a guy in the face.

I have an automatic pistol that sets people on fire when they get shot... that is borderlands. :D"
14703,"Marvelous aesthetic to the cel-shaded style graphics.  Fast-paced gamepley, tons of content.  Playing with cohorts for class synergy ratchets up the fun.  Good buy, nice price."
14704,This is where the cars live! Get you one!
14705,"It's good, can't wait for Borderlands 2."
14706,"Este juego es simple, quizas muy simple y aun asi te puede tener horas y horas jugando, si te consigues un amigo para jugarlo en coop, ya estamos hablando facilmente de horas y horas de juego, incluso una ves terminada la historia principal."
14707,Fun and addictive shooter with great RPG elements! Can't stop playing!
14708,"""Its time, hu huuh, for another pound of flesh!"""
14709,it can be awesome and he can enjoy himself at varius place
14710,Great game if you like lots of guns and loot
14711,Retarded game is retarded.
14712,good game
14713,this game is super good !!! just like 3D FPS diablo!
14714,Do you like shooting things? Who doesnt? How about blowing things up? Yay! Now add in 47 BAZILLION GUNS and you got Borderlands!
14715,"Enjoyed it. Fun one player ride that didn't feel like grinding.
Beat it through with DLCs 1 playthrough with a sniper.
Loved the boss battles, felt like old school gaming."
14716,Hey. I recommend this game
14717,Awesome game hours of play pity it uses gfwl otherwise it would be perfect
14718,"amazing game, espicially good for co-op"
14719,it is a great game so buy it already
14720,Best game ever.
14721,"This game is better than its sequel when played alone, but many times better when played with friends. The RPG elements in this are not at all like fallout, and for a game of this scope the story is actually good. It has an insane number of weapons, and you are constantly getting a better arsenal which may be annoying when you have settled on a gun with aesthetics that you like since there is no upgrade system. I never tried playing new game+ but this game is a solid 8/10."
14722,This game rocks! Spend the $5. You won't be disappointed.
14723,"Really epic fps rpg game, can't wait for the sequel.

*UPDATE* I waited for the sequel, and the second installment was even better than the first. While the pre-sequel was a bummer in comparison I'm patiently awaiting the third."
14724,Fun Game like the randomness of the items that drop and looking forward to playing the DLC when I get to it.
14725,"This game is a fantastic game, especially for co-operative... the only downfall is the Gamespy part, but all in all you can choose your favourite character and level them up along side your friends!

All in all this game gets  9/10 from me!"
14726,"Easily one of the more unusual FPS titles out there.  A bit of Mad Max, a bit of Deadlands: Hell on Earth, a bit of Fallout, and a bit of Diablo II.  Yes, you can more or less live out those post apocalyptic fantasies here. 

Also, if that isn't interesting enough despite being primarilly an FPS it's kind of addictive in the Diablo II sort of way—finding amazing loot and continuing to upgrade your character.   In fact some DLC (like Moxxi's Underdome Riot) is purely there to roll up unusual loot."
14727,"Borderlands does a wonderful job of combining traditional RPG elements with the first person shooter genre. Randomized elements and numerous missions will keep you playing this game for a long time, making a replay of the game feel almost like playing a new game. A solid campaign enjoyable alone or with friends only enhances the experience. There are some flaws, such as dull environments, very similarly functioning weapons, slow exploration, and an overall lack of variety after awhile, but all in all it's a pretty great game."
14728,"Un juegazo. Se merece el título de GOTY de aquí a lima. Un poco agobiante por eso de que está todo muy hecho polvo (literalmente, es todo tierra vaya) y hay mucha roca. Si te gusta el Cellshading y el género Shooter, COMPRA."
14729,The best game I've played in probably 10 years. Extremely addicting. There really are no flaws in this game. Insane amount of weapons. Hilarious characters and humor. Tons of replay value. Constantly searching for that perfect weapon. Lets hope the sequel is just as good.
14730,One of the most fun co-op experiences in a long time. Fun mix of RPG and FPS.
14731,"One of the greatest COOP games of ALL TIME. A great combination of fun, awesome loot system, and game world."
14732,"Honestly, even if you still haven't played this game, it's still totally worth picking up. Borderlands represents an experiment within two genres and pulls it off wonderfully Cooperative play only heightens the fun. Cannot recommend enough."
14733,Guns
14734,You gonna squeal before we cook ya!?
14735,Da best of FPS/RPG 4 EVA :D
14736,Great game worht Checking out!
14737,"Borderlands is a treat of a game - 3rd Person Shooter, cell shaded colouring with rototscoping and a humourous take on these sort of games."
14738,it's Like Christmas!
14739,"Insane, over-the-top, ridiculous, crazy, etc. Borderlands is the O.G. of looter-shooters."
14740,"Kill these bitches -,,-"
14741,"Borderlands is everything you could want in a FPS-RPG. With incredible storytelling, characters, humor, and an insane amount of guns, I would recommend this game to anyone."
14742,best fpsrpg out there
14743,This game is next-gen porn
14744,"Nice game. It's not as fun if you can't play with friends, over skype or some sort of voice-software though!"
14745,"Amazing game, buy it and have fun."
14746,Wonderful game to play with friends over voice chat.
14747,great game to play with a few good friends. multiplayer version of fallout without the great graphics.
14748,"This game is absolutely amazing.  Got me into FPS games.  I just love the comic relief within ths game, the story lines are fun.  While playing part 2 is repetitive (as it's a replay of part 1 but at a higher level), the chance of getting the permutations of millions of guns in the game keep it interesting.

And Mad Moxxi...who can argue with that.  <3 Mad Moxxi."
14749,"if you like loot, you'll like borderlands"
14750,"Awesome game, Highly recommended"
14751,FPS meets RPG.  It's pretty fun if you have friends to play with.  Playing it in single player gets a little tedious.
14752,"In a world where games are quite short, Borderlands is far from that.  There's also a fair amount of DLC but that doesn't mean the base game is half finished.  The graphics may look a bit primitive at first but the style is intentional.  The advantage also is that it runs well on older systems.
The gun junkies among us will find a load of guns of all types, pistols, rifles, shotguns, launchers etc to satisfy us.

The recent game of the year edition has enhanced the game somewhat.  As is to be expected, it is a lot better in coop play with a like minded group of psychopaths.  This is obvious throughout the whole Borderlands series of course."
14753,"""Ok guys we have about 10 bandits and a couple other baddies in the next room, all we need to do is-OH SWEET MOTHER OF FUCK LOOK AT ALL THESE GUNS AWW SHIT NIGGA OH MY GOD FUCK I LUVVVV THIS GUN SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT"""
14754,Extremely Fun and awesome game to play!
14755,"Great game, hours of fun in COOP. Main campaign can get a bit dull but friends and DLC make this game a must buy!"
14756,THIS IS A GOOD GAME.
14757,Best played with friends!
14758,Borderlands was fun when it was first released and it still is if you can get some friends to play with you. Although the multiplayer functionality is most likely broken due to the recent Gamespy shutdown.
14759,"Tastes like a whole bunch of win and victory. Especially with the General Knoxx DLC. A quality game with a fantastic style, a great sense of humour and hours of entertainment to be had."
14760,This is a fun diabloesc shooter game :)
14761,The best game I've played this year (and I regret not having played before...)
14762,"Cool game, comic style first person shooter"
14763,Best rpg with fps ever!
14764,Exceptional coop experience.  Great single player as well with a ton of replay value!
14765,"It's a great rpg shooter with alot of humor.

Team up with 3 of your friends or go in alone and go through the isane world of pandora with customizable classes, looting weird weapons and killing bad ass enemies."
14766,"Fun, diablo depth weapons and tf2 style cartoony graphics..."
14767,"A beautifully executed FPSRPG, one that's actually managed to grab and hold me past completion. The cell-shading voisuals don;t detract from gameplay, and the weapon systems allows for great degrees of personalization in the way you play the game. Top notch, I say!"
14768,"Viciante, você nao vê a hora passar enquanto joga. Quando você se diverte é isso que acontece!"
14769,Bordering lands is a very enjoyable activity when hunting the dreaded skagzila.
14770,"Det er mega sjovt og så er der også meget splatter i det
"
14771,Great Game
14772,"Never gets old
"
14773,Better Then heroin and it's 75% off lolz
14774,Fudging A
14775,"Plenty of weapons plenty of enemies at a reasonable difficulty, loads of fun!"
14776,"Игра просто класс, но только при условии , что будете играть в ко-опе."
14777,"Despite it's simple storyline, this game is really a lot of fun and you can easily sink hours upon hours into it with all the side quests available to you."
14778,Guns guns guns guns guns guns guns
14779,"Borderlands blends FPS with RPG, and I don't mean rocket propelled grenades."
14780,"previously owned this on xbox, but when i saw the price i had to purchase this. the game has provided me with hundreds of hours of gameplay. A must have for any pc gamer."
14781,You can shoot bullets from your gun.
14782,"One of the best rpg/shooters out there for co-op! A real must-have!
Stop reading this and go play it!"
14783,"A brilliant mix of FPS, RPG and post-apocalyptic-like sceneries ;)"
14784,shit my pants
14785,"It's fun but I eventually couldn't keep playing, I ended up at a point where the enemies were far higher than my level and it was either go back and grind up or keep trying and die (Primarily my own laziness here). As a side note, I personally don't like it when weapons have a minimum level required on them but I can see why it is the way it is."
14786,Get it when its cheep and it'll be a good time killer (writeing this for the steam holiday sale thing)
14787,"..
"
14788,epic game especially with all the DLCs combined! makes for a fun multiplayer (or single player) experience.
14789,Addictive and crazy. The RPG and shooter elements work together surprisingly well.
14790,Awesome Game.  I love the art style as well as the gameplay.
14791,A perfect blend of wRPG looting/character building and FPS shooting things in the face. A good time with a few friends in tow.
14792,I bought Borderlands on steam for about five euros and 150 hours later it's still awesome! The unique graphical style creates real atmosphere and the RPG elements keep you coming back for more even when you have finished the main missions. The DLC is also awesome (although Mad Moxxies Underdome wasn't all that great) and helps extend the game for many more hours of fun!
14793,"Awesome game, Even better with friends. Must buy even if you just play solo"
14794,"It's a fun sandbox FPS. I completed it, and it gives you about 80hrs of gameplay.
Can be replayed, with toughter enemies. It had some hidden enemies that are crazy to kill 'em!
Buy it if you find a deal (75% or so)"
14795,Ain't no rest for the wicked
14796,TIME TO POUND THE MEAT PUPPET!
14797,Grab this First Person Shooter/RPG hybrid that has memorable characters and lots of personality.  Highly recommended.
14798,Yes.
14799,"Brilliant game, DLCs are amazing"
14800,This is supper fun four player co-op
14801,"Looting, shooting and mayhem.
Totally worth buying.
Recommended."
14802,"Very good game.  Unique, cell-shaded art style. decent shooting mechanics, and memorable characters.  Definately a good bye."
14803,"This game has amazing co-op, and I'm not saying this just because it's a Steam Achievement for christmas. It's really fun!"
14804,Great online play.
14805,"If you don't play this game, you don't like fun."
14806,VERY GOOD GAME
14807,"Ah Borderlands. Truth be told I played this more as a solo player vs coop, but all the gameplay just has a certain kind of drive that pushes you to keep playing. I'm not sure if i'll ever 100% the game, and it does some some small quality of life issues versus its sequels, but this game is definitely in my top 100 game...8/10"
14808,A must have game :D
14809,Is sweet for shooting things.
14810,"Me surpreendi com esse jogo, muito bom mesmo, uma paródia de Fallout 3, só use um FXAA, pois o game não suporta nenhum tipo de AA e fica meio tosco sem isso.

Fora a tradução da GV que falha em vários diálogos, mas quem curte o estilo RPG e FPS é extremamente recomendado."
14811,"Guns.

Mmm, guns. They shoot stuff! Firey, acidey, lightningey stuff.

Story? What story? You just need to shoot more bullets! It's probably more fun with a friend or two but I wouldn't know because who has time for friends when you can go look for more shooty boomsticks? It's Diablo as an FPS with guns (and shields!) as loot.

Oh, and the Claptraps are kind of cute. I want one! I will hug it and squeeze it and cherish it forever and protect it from raiders with my GUNS. And maybe use it for target practice."
14812,Great game to grind for items!!
14813,awesome FPS & RPG hybrid
14814,"- Great FPS style combat with good RPG elements.
- Story drags you along but never seems too tedious.
- Randomized item system.
- Ending is bullshit times 10.
- Multiple playthroughs available and good coop

Get the crazy guns, go through the crazy landscape and crazy story and get the crazier sequel."
14815,"And amazing game, especially if you have a bunch of friends who love shooting crap."
14816,Claptrap Sucks dinossaur balls!
14817,An Amazing game to play with friends or just to run arround and kill things :)
14818,"Very cool art style, and pretty fun game.  Definatly worth buying."
14819,"If you're thinking about getting this, I just have one question for you. Where the hell have you been? How do you not own this game already? Seriously, what is wrong with you."
14820,Great  Game.  Playing by yourself is still fun but with friends is awesome.
14821,"I'm not a fan of FPS's at all.  The artistic style is horribly pleasing to the eye, and the more I play, the more depth the game unveils to me.  I'm only two hours in, but so far it's time well spent.  

(I watched this game played on the keyboard, but I died constantly and the controls were clunky.  After switching to a controller, the controls are streamlined and effortless to pick up.)"
14822,"Gaaf spel, heel vaak gelachen, maar dat einde....!!!!"
14823,Great game!!!
14824,I like this game!
14825,"I really like this game, it has the feel of Diablo but yet its fps :D fast paced and fun with the friends or just meeting new people :)"
14826,"There is absolutely NO depth to this game, but who cares! That's half the fun! Any shooter that lets you roam around freely without some idiot with 'Follow' over his head gets an immediate thumbs up."
14827,I hope I don't brain my damage.
14828,Needs more claptrap
14829,One of the best games ever!
14830,"This game is fun, more fun than your average fun too."
14831,"One of the best RPG's I've played in a long time, very creative art and great storyline to boot. *Claptrap* *Look I'm dancing*"
14832,"In theory does a lot of things ""wrong"", especially in the first minutes of the game. In practice, its compulsion-based design makes you want to complete one more quest. I suspect it can be great fun with friends in multiplayer."
14833,pure awesomeness
14834,Super jeu de rpg/action où on bourrine bien! Je le conseilles fortement ^^
14835,A game that blends action and rpg in a wonderful manner. Its long gameplay and interesting game modes offer hours upon hours of fun and mayhem.
14836,It's 2018 - play Borderlands 2
14837,Awesome and really fun if your looking for a fun RPGshooter style game it has great graphics and has some of the most interesting dlc and voice acting :)!!!<3
14838,sexy game hehehe
14839,"Attention all buyers: Claptrap.
That is all."
14840,"Great game, It's a must have if you dont have it. Also get all the DLC.



Edit: This game will consume your life, along with Borderlands 2 (mostly this one), Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. Not to mention there is also the upcoming Borderlands 3."
14841,"It's fun after a while, until it gets a bit repetative and becomes boring. Good buy for a sale though"
14842,Squee!!! Geek Joy.
14843,"En çok zaman geçirdiğim oyun, 10 numara gerçekten."
14844,This game is the greatest FPS Loot-fest ever; practically the only one.
14845,"A nice game to play with friends, lots of actions and lots of different guns."
14846,оригинальный шутер аналогов нету мореее оружия суперр рекомендую не пожалеете!!!
14847,THIS IS MADNESS
14848,GET YOU ONE
14849,⠀⠀
14850,Super!
14851,Games Pretty Good But I Took an arrow to the knee so now its ok...
14852,"Very good game, although, there aren't any borders besides the game walls. :D"
14853,"Try this awesome game from Gearbox software. It kept me playing it for over 180 hours, and I really don't remember any newer game that kept me in front of the screen that long.
Awesome, try it :)"
14854,the best game!
14855,Лучшее развлечение для вас и троих ваших друзей!
14856,"AINT NO REST FOR THE WICKED, GOT THIS GAME LIKE 10 YEARS LATE
I GOT THINGS TO SHOOT, I GOT CARS TO DRIVE, AND SKILLS TO JUST UPGRADE
I CAN'T LOOK BACK, CAN'T SAY I'M BORED. ALTHOUGH, I WISH, I COULD.
AIN'T NO WAY ANY SANE MAN, SHOULDN'T CALL THIS GAME GOOD."
14857,"Fun, replayable, and now even helluva cheap. Come on, what you waitin' for? Christmas? No, wait."
14858,just fun
14859,"best mix of shooter and action rpg ever!

and you never complete game, because the collector achievment not work!(for 2 characters)"
14860,Good game. I like the variations of the weapons!
14861,Great fun and a good time killer. Excellent co-op if you have friends to play it with. Make sure to get all the DLC's with the game or it will get too bland.
14862,One of the BEST GAME EVER!!!
14863,"Niezła rozgrywka, szczególnie przyjemna w coopie. Oryginalny styl graficzny i system losowego tworzenia broni, tylko dodaje uroku tej grze."
14864,A realy AWESOME RPG/FPS game !!! F*CKIN' PLAY IT !!!
14865,"its fun

14866,IMO Borderlands is the ultimate fusion between FPS and RPG. Simply a MASTERPIECE!
14867,great game for cop
14868,A good coop game.
14869,I really like this one. Lots of fun for a long time. Excelent multiplayer.
14870,Probably one of the most fun multiplayer fps games I've played with my friends.
14871,"Greeat game! combination of FPS and RPG, awesome cartoon style, 8.5/10"
14872,Be awesome and buy this game!
14873,"In a world where game developers tend to put too much focus on ultra-realistic graphics and/or a huge fancy plot. Borderlands remebers what is really important: Fun, Balanced, gameplay. 

While Borderland's RPG elements may turn off FPS purists, those willing to give this a try will find it one of the better games you can find on Steam."
14874,"Great game to play with friends.  Combines the best of Diablo 2 and FPS with over the top enemies, powers, and locations."
14875,funny game ^.^
14876,"Game is a lot more fun with friends, and has great writing. 

Playing solo, it's not that great, and feels sort of like an empty world."
14877,"RPG FPS, four classes, lots of leveling and quests.  A ton of fun."
14878,Frigging awesome game! FPS RPG
14879,i liek 2 shot scags
14880,"Great game, but only if you have someone else to play it with."
14881,awsome
14882,"8.5/10

Try to find the vault with your friends, and solve the mystery.

+ A lot of fun with your friends in co-op, many many weapons, great DLC
- A LOT of CRASHES, almost no storyline, a lot of brown coloured worlds.

Wanna have a lot of fun in co-op, buy this game! You'll have fun for more than 45 hours (with dlc)."
14883,!
14884,My favorite shooter-rpg game.
14885,"Such a great game, I originally had it for the XBox and i must have had 6 play throughs. Now I have it for the PC and I still am not bored of it."
14886,"Fantastic game,good story, selection of many weapons and 4 super characters.it's so addictive"
14887,Awesome awesome awesome!
14888,"great game, lots of guns to choose from, always an emeny around to try it out on :-)"
14889,"This is most addicitve. Play the DLC too, the zombies are fun, the killer claptraps hilarious! I only did not like the end boss in the Vault, way too overpowered.
Buy it, play it!"
14890,"Awesomely fun RPG Coop shooter, meant to be enjoyed with friends!"
14891,"Best CO-OP game in a very very long time.
Definitely worth every penny."
14892,"Excelent game, I like it a lot, buy it :D"
14893,"this game is AWESOME! 
Hours and hours of killing fun :O)"
14894,Fun.
14895,If you haven't already bought this game then you really should. Especially given that the game and all its DLC can be had for a song these days. I've wasted many an hour playing and replaying this game to experience it from each of the different character types.
14896,2 words. F*cking Awesome
14897,"An extremely fun shooter that just gets better as you go! Always leaves you looking forward to next great gun you'll find, and the leveling system helps you define your character the way you want to play them. Could use more classes... but that's where Borderlands 2 may come in :)."
14898,This game is hilarious
14899,"One of the more addicting shooters to come out recently. 4-player online co-op, tons of loot, enemies, and different ways to spec your character. Easy to put 80+ hours into this game. Plus supported well with new DLC over the lifespan of the game."
14900,Really good game. :)
14901,"Got this game as a bundle with my friends, great game whether you're playing single player or multiplayer."
14902,Damn awesome game.  Super cheap on Steam and will easily provide 100+ hours of playtime.
14903,Fun game to play with friends. FPS RPG with a millon unique guns
14904,"Even tho it's a shitty console port at best, the game itself is still awesome :P"
14905,This game is great. It'll please anyone that likes RPGs and FPS games.
14906,"Bottom line: Kind of boring on single player, but can be fun with other players. Relies heavily on fetch quests. It's always the same, go here, get that thing/kill that guy/click on the thing and come back. But shennanigens crop up in multiplayer, especially since enemies become stronger and so requires teamwork with more players. The classes are versatile enough that you'll probably find a niche for yourself, and you can reset the skills you pick if things don't work out. Also, there's like a bazillion weapons, but that just means that you'll find a lot of useless junk to sell to traders on the off chance that they'll have something good to sell to you. Also, all the npcs are boring, but that might just be like, my opinion man"
14907,this is a good game.
14908,"A vast of fun in coop, okay in singleplayer - worth picking up as steam deal, period."
14909,A great looting and killing spree with humor and great weapons.
14910,A great game and concept that can become very imerresive and engaging if the time is taken too. All the DLC add even more flavor to the world of Pandora and are also a great addition if you can get them.
14911,"A great game to play with friends! However, solo players beware. This game could easily get tedious alone. With friends, the difficulty level of the enemies in the game is drastically increased, as well as the quality of loot!"
14912,skags.
14913,.
14914,"Amazing co-op game, lots of fun to be had with friends."
14915,Game can be immensely fun when played with friends but can also be incredibly dull playing by yourself buy if you have someone to play with!
14916,Single player is pretty fun but playing online with 3 other friends is the best. This is the most fun I've had playing online with friends.
14917,sexy
14918,"I'll tell you right now, If you're looking for a dystopian wasteland replete with vile creatures, insane despots, machiavellian corporations and backstabbing scum who would just as soon put a bullet in you than shake your hand, look no further...... Oh yeah, its also a great deal of fun! :)"
14919,"I really like the game, but I couldn’t find the stupid cake.
"
14920,"Diablo-styled weapon drop system is this FPS Adventure's greatest feature.  Keep an eye on the developer, Gearbox.  They make games for gamers."
14921,this game is beast and epic
14922,"Negative review for ALL 2K games until they get rid of launcher bloatware.

Possibly the Greatest game of all time"
14923,One of the most fun games in a while
14924,Awesome coop
14925,COOL
14926,"This game has its warts (repetitive quests, nonexistent ending in the base game), but overall it's a fun ride. Be sure to get the GotY edition for the full experience."
14927,Enjoyed the game at release on 360 so much that I had to repurchase it on Steam once I built a good enough PC to run it.
14928,Millions of Guns = lots of fun
14929,"Not completely a first person shooter, not yet a dungeon crawler. With the best bits from these two worlds, here comes Borderlands. Bring a friend."
14930,Play online only 4 friends
14931,"muito bom o jogo, uma grande variadade de armas"
14932,Great game with plenty to do. Bring on the second one
14933,If you dont have this game.  Get it.
14934,"amazing game, cant play enough of it, used to play on xbox but now on pc :)"
14935,"Gets boring when playing alone, gets less boring when playing co-op. Funny mayhem, lots of variety in guns, pretty linear but damn. It's an fps experiment, still a better story than twilight."
14936,This game is fun.
14937,"this game is awesome and super funny, if you have a friend with this game, play the coop and be happy :D"
14938,One of the best RPG/FPS I've ever played. I really wish the main campaign was a lot less walky as the DLC.
14939,Pretty neat game! Best played as a co-up.
14940,lagg
14941,"Lots, lots, lots of weapons. Yeah :)"
14942,great game !!
14943,Boderlands ist ein geilesspiel mit fielen waffen und einer guten storrie
14944,Enjoyable game to play with your friends...and looking for weapons.
14945,"Exciting co-op adventure-shooter-combo with a lot to explore. Finding, trading and using rare weapons makes this game highly addictive. Try to find a reliable co-op partner for this tho."
14946,NEAT Coop experience... Awesome ambience and gameplay!!! (Fix your FOV b4 playing).
14947,"Comic stylized, arcade like with character stat building elements set in backwater space colonies, and humorous characters... fun times."
14948,Epic RPG open world game.
14949,Great game 10/10
14950,"Great fun if you can play it with friends. The environments could be more diverse, but I guess the DLC fixes that to some degree."
14951,Great game with great coop.
14952,Tons of weapons = Tons of fun!
14953,"Very decent game. A huge pile of weapons, a variety of opponents, giant boses & a sea of fun (preferably with your friends)."
14954,Awesome co-op game
14955,Sweet game!
14956,"I can't believe it took me so long to play this game! It's amazing how well it blends RPG and FPS

There is not a lot to think about in this game, but that is completely ok, it's just a really fun slaughterfest"
14957,Awesome lolz
14958,Best First Person Shooter I've ever played
14959,This is a good game if you got freinds to play with
14960,"Gibbing midgets with an explosive shotgun or your fists. Need any more reason?
"
14961,"good stuff, cartoony graphics though, but fun anyways"
14962,"Great game, good for some fun with friends. Great co-op and great value for money. Certainly going to buy Borderlands 2."
14963,Great fun
14964,game good
14965,This is a good game to play with friends
14966,i like it
14967,Awesome with friends
14968,"FUCKING LOVE THIS GAME!!!
CANT WAIT FOR BORDERLANDS 2!!!"
14969,THIS GAME IS FUN
14970,"Fun, but only once. Coop is a must."
14971,"What can anyone say about Borderlands that hasn't been said before? Lewt, lewt and more lewt!  Character classes, literally millions of weapons that randomly spawn, cartoonesque imagery, an adorable robot - this.game.is.fabulous. Especially if you have borderline OCD like I do, you'll be amused / entertained for hours. There are some *very* annoying in-game glitches but there are *usually* fixes available for those. I picked this up on special and I've well and truly got my money's worth and then some.  Viva la robolution! :)"
14972,"Love this game. It's good because it has the 2 best styles together: RPG and FPS.
Amo esse jogo, ele é bom por ter os 2 melhores estilos juntos: RPG e FPS."
14973,"Awesome storyline, smooth gameplay, hours uponhours of fun, and very high replay value."
14974,The best game slow paced action around !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14975,"What is there to say, its Borderlands! Check it out but dont blame me when you get addicted to it."
14976,в кооперативе - ураган.
14977,Great action and great character make this game hard to resist.  As the game progresses the developers put less character but the action is good enough to carry it through.
14978,Very.. very brain-explosive game=)
14979,Great game.  Can't wait for Borderlands2!
14980,AWESOME!!!
14981,Endless hours of fun!
14982,best game ever try it well you can. the christmas sale dont last for ever so get it NOW!!!
14983,"shooting people in the face and runnin Biznatches over with a vehicle? DONE!
"
14984,awesome coop
14985,"What better way to show that you like Bacon than playing this game with a piece of bread on your noggin. This game is eggcelent, and I like turnip apples."
14986,"Diablo with guns, humour and much more, GET IT!"
14987,"130 hours and counting.  If you're looking at $7.50 for the GotY edition and can pull that kind of time out of it, I'd say you'd be getting your money's worth :)"
14988,"Hands down, one of the most fun coop experiences you can have."
14989,If you have some friends to play this with I hear its fun. I got it long after release and played through it solo; it was boring as hell.
14990,"Random weapon loot, fast paced action against pretty dumb opponents - this is a game best played with another friend, or preferably 3, since you get a much more lively game (it gets harder) - especially since you can revive each other in battle.

The vistas and enemies do end up being pretty varied and you can find some tough fights. Luckily not much corridor cover shooting, just blasting enemies more Serious Sam style, ducking out of combat to heal up your shields.

Graphics, sound and controls are all reasonable to good. Cell shading works, and once the PC config files are altered a wee bit you can remove the awful feeling of sludge movement your mouse might otherwise have.

I've not finished all the DLC packs as of writing but they're entertaining expansions of simply just ""more"" - more levels, enemies and levelups. If you enjoyed the original game you'd enjoy them simply put. If you really enjoyed the original game, you can play through more times against levelled up enemies."
14991,"If you haven't played borderlands yet then get 3 of your good friends and start loosing sleep. The co-op is excellent and the world is a bizarre, backwoods wasteland with a  tongue in cheek crude sense of humor humor. It's a loot game and there's always new weapons to pickup. The story is good althought the ending is a bit lackluster, but who cares. You're here to shoot everything that moves and ask questions later."
14992,"A great RPG first-person shooter. Borderlands takes many of the elements that make RPG games so great (skill trees, free roam, unique weapons, etc.) and turns it into a FPS. What I love about games like these is that you always find it hard to put it down, since it`s just so much fun. My only compaint are the redundant quests. Otherwise, a fantastic game."
14993,"Really fun FPS/RPG.  The storyline is a little lacking, but it's very fun to play."
14994,"A 'shoot-n-loot' game, that has defined the RPG Shooter genre; and mercifully doesn't take itself too seriously."
14995,"I was really looking forward to this game back when it was about to be released. Cel-shaded graphics ? Infinite loot ? Lots of freedom ? I'm game ! Having finished it a few days later I can tell you that it was not what I was looking for. Yes, the graphics were awesome. The infinite loot really was infinite, but a lot of it was useless. In the end I had only a few guns that really were powerful. Most of the weapons were underpowered and not worth the time. The freedom part was, well, somewhat accurate. You couldn't drive anywhere you want, there were some obstacles where you just had to get out of the vehicle. Now, that last part I didn't really mind; if it was fully open it would've ruined the game.
But the missions were repetitive and I missed the part like where you look at your armor and see it change. You only had weapons to look at, and the weapons don't change all that much. For me it had no replay value because of that.
Here's hoping that 2 will improve on most of these things.

[Rating: 82/100]"
14996,"REALLY FUNNNY, IF YOU LIKE FALLOUT 3 / NEWVEGAS I RECOMMEND THIS GAME"
14997,"Неплохо. Но скучновато .
"
14998,Pure awesomeness :)
14999,Exploding heads
15000,This game is radsauce
15001,First game I've played with comic style graphics. Different and very enjoyable.
15002,"While somewhat repetitive, the ability to choose your fighting style and build a character around it is fun, while giving you a relatively open world to run around in."
15003,"Great game, best to play it with a couple of pals with a mic chat program such as Ventrillo or Team Speak. Different guns each time, game has a gun making engine which mix and matches gun parts and presents it to the gamer each time they open a weapon chest, is estimated to create over a million different types of gun.
Although, missions do tend to get boring and repetitive after a long period of playing and the main quest is too short but thankfully the DLC's will keep you entertained over a long period of time.

My rating: 9/10 - Quite good."
15004,Borderland? Diablo played with guns in FPS.
15005,good
15006,"Borderlands.. Great gameplay, Good Story."
15007,Have had a terrific time playing the game co-op with a friend. Got almost 60 hours out of the base game but it ended with us wanting more. Time for DLC...
15008,"Borderlands, Borderlands, Borderlands. You're such an odd game. On the one hand, it's fun exploring your vast world and collecting weapons along the way, the combat and guns are fun too. However your quests get grindy and repetitive, your story is non existant which would have made the quests more bearable if there was a more fleshed out story and your ending is seriously one of the worst i've played. But I feel that the pros outway the cons so I recommend it if you're a fan of action RPG's, just don't expect anything really great though."
15009,"Remarkably engrossing. Starts off slow, but after 3-4 hours you really start to get a feel for the options and gameplay."
15010,Buy this game.
15011,"People seem to be in the two hate-love camps, and I'm sort of in the former. Find a few good friends, some free weekends and a decent computer set-up and blast away."
15012,kick azz game but beware of the scammers in-game
15013,bloody bath ^^
15014,Best Game Evööööör
15015,"This game is very cool, only screwed thing is an extremely tough difficulty in co-op play. Bandit kills you in 3 shots and you kill him in..hmm..a few hundred? Anyway, it's still pretty good and i'd give it 8,5/10."
15016,"Sigh,.... what can i say. I really loved this game. But, i really hate the cheating or as the dev's called it the ""mod"" community.... Honestly, what was the point of the guns if your just gonna support the cheating community, i mean really? why spend hours in the game if the devs allow and support modding of guns where you can just create    your perfect gun? I just dont understand. I would of became a devout contributer to this game if things were different.... just sad.


(rating withheld due to lack of faith)"
15017,"This RPG FPS with different classes and coop gameplay was a new concept for me and it has its moments.
Playing it with friends is pretty much required though and questing can feel like repetitive grinding after some time."
15018,"Pros: Fun, funny and visually compelling; well-written & acted in a cheesy, self-aware kind of way; compulsively addictive collecting and upgrading; contains a great variety of gameplay as far as shooting goes.

Cons: Campaign story is painfully thin even as the universe is cohesive and full of character. The acerbic wit and spot-on culture references do go a long way to make up for the lack of good narrative."
15019,"Diablo with guns, endless lootfest."
15020,"It's fun, but the ending, if you want to call it that, is horrible."
15021,Amazing game and so addicting.
15022,"one of the best games I have ever played , hell even it pulled me from WoW and the weekly raiding , I may lost DKP points but killing psychos was worth the loss ."
15023,"""It's like Christmas."""
15024,"I have mixed feelings about this game. Yes it is fun with very a nice visual style and gameplay but it is repetitive. You will start off loving the game and chasing the next level up or new weapon but sooner or later you will realise it is just a massive grind fest. Go here kill these dudes, now go somewhere else and kill a different bunch of dudes etc. This goes on and on until you complete the entirely forgettable story line. The DLC adds some new missions which are reasonably entertaining but are pretty much more of the same. The Mad Moxxi DLC pack seems to give up all attempts to disguise that it is a grind fest and just put you in arena full of dudes to shoot. So yes this game is worth playing but it will get tedious and you will give up at some point."
15025,"good coop game , don't join a game where guy are more exp than u 7.5/10"
15026,"multiplayer is poorly implemented vs other similar games
'tude of the game i find grating
gfx, souless
textbook example of a game that does alot right but still isnt worth playing
"
15027,Its like Gauntlet but with guns.. and the Uncle from GTA4.
15028,"Really fun to play with your friends.

To people who were looking a good co op game back in the time and bought ""Left 4 Dead 2"" instead of this gem, I ask you now;

Where is Left 4 Dead 3? Ha!? BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE ANY SEQUELS TO THAT! 

Final Verdict: [b] 8/10 [/b]"
15029,"It's freakin BOARDERLANDS, cme on!"
15030,"I really liked this game, lots to do, lots of challenging missions and easy to save the game when needed. I kinda wish the weak monsters would stop attacking you once you level up though, it's a waste of your time to kill a level 0 monsters when you are level 28 but they chase you just the same."
15031,FPSRPG... doesn't matter had ***
15032,k
15033,"Good for the masses, but the online multiplayer is really buggy."
15034,"Hey, your brain fell out. Did that hurt?
If you have joy in senseless murder, then you will like this game. You won't be killing lot of players (unless they accept duel), but tonn of NPC for your pleasure is guranteed.
If you don't like playing in team, you can play this game solo. But with friends it is more fun!

Wait... Wait! Don't use rocket launcher in this... ouch, room. Friendly fire is on."
15035,"I received the Borderlands pack with the 4-pack of DLC and I have to say, it's been amazing fun.  I realize that Borderlands is an older game, but there's a lot to do and every weekend I look forward to the Wasteland-esque graphics and quirky sense of humor the game has to offer.  

I highly recommend this game to anyone that wants to have some exciting Co-Op action.  Especially if it's on sale for $4.99 or something great like that.  Personally, I cannot wait for the sequel, I am sure it will not disappoint."
15036,"FPS mixed with RPG. Lots of driving around in wastelands. Fun game with a good atmosphere and lots of baddies to kill, although they are a little tough for an aging gamer! Co-op play is one of the best around."
15037,"I gave them the chance of aiding me willingly, but they have elected the way of pain. We have only to remove those who oppose us."
15038,"Cell shaded game with a tiered, random item generator.  The co-op mode is excellent. The game's difficulty and loot scale up as the number of players increase.   If you liked the Diablo series,  you will probably like this game as well."
15039,"Uh, an amazingly fun, very long-lasting game... What more can I say besides get it and love it?"
15040,Terra das Bordas é foda um misto de fps e rpg que combina muito bem
15041,"Review ---
Pros --- The graphics are stylised no doubt. The guns are cool, you can set monsters on fire, you can electrocute them. A lot of guns.
Cons --- You are a character on a planet which you know nothing about. Repetitive, the endless list of missions are all the same(Kill --- amount of ---, Kill ---, Find --- are all there is to it) which makes it feel more like ""chores"". Basically you do missions, side missions, kill a boss then unlock a new area and start all over again. AI is stupid if you're far, even in the wide open they don't even move. No minimap thus having to constantly hold tab."
15042,"One of my favorite game of all time. Obviously buy it at all cost. It's really a RPG mixed in with a shooter. It's totally shooter, with a skill tree, you get exp, levels, critical hits etc.

Playing this game with a friend is simply pure win. So much fun to this game

If you don't care about achivement completion, skip Moxxi's DLC.

Overall: 8.5/10
with a friend, 10/10(!!)"
15043,"epic!!!!!!

"
15044,Diablo with a SHOTGUN! Part FPS part RPG all FUN!
15045,It was good enough of a game to make my friend play it for a week straight.
15046,"This game was amazingggggggggggggggggg. It had great humor, great pickups and tons of gameplay, The DLC was great, all were unique and added even more gameplay! It only did one DLC wrong, other then that its a quality game and worth every cent. People who loved diablo 2 will love this game. 7.50 spent for GOTY and 82 hours put in.. Worth it"
15047,"This game is awesome, easily a good 60+ hours of replay value here. Buy GOTY Edition since the DLC is really good. In terms of the DLC I'd rate it: Claptrap > Secret Armory > Zombie Island >>>>>>>> Moxxie's Underome. The Moxxie dome is absolute garbage, I only played it for the achievements. The other 3 are good.

If you like diablo 2, buy this game. Its diablo 2 in a FPS"
15048,"A really good game to play with your friends and have lots of fun, buy it, you won't regreat õ/"
15049,NIKKI WE NEED TO FINISH THIS GAME WE HAVE LITERALLY 15 MINS OF IT LEFT
15050,"Ever feel like you just couldn't get that perfect gun?
Think there's never enough enemies to mow down?
In Borderlands there's so much guns and baddies that you'll drown in them!
Fast-firing rocket launchers, electrifying submachine guns, teleporting grenades or sentry turrets, you can get 'em all here!
Team up with a few friends and bring the apocalypse to the dusty world of Pandora!"
15051,Have fun shooting things in The Land of Borders.
15052,This game is like nipples drinking budweiser whilst skating on ice cream
15053,Probably the most fun you can have in a Co-op game with your friends. If this was eBay i'd simply put A++ :-)
15054,Borderlands is the ultimate dungeon-crawler with guns. The guns and loot are great. The characters and humor are great. The boss battles and RPGness are great. I LOVE this game. I can't wait for the sequel.
15055,"   Pros:
   - Irritable ammount of weapons to wreak havoc upon your enemies
   - Unique style & great looks ( Some games don't need to look like Modern Warfare 5 to be great looking)
   - Hours and hours of gameplay, replay value & DLCs to go with it.

   Cons
   - Annoying FOV. Good thing I'm not claustrophobic cause I'd have a hard time playing it
   - Racism against midgets and mutants. Nah, just joking."
15056,"One of the better games I have played in a long time, it has it's share of aggravating moments, but they only take up maybe an hours worth grand total of game time, and this game takes about 30-50 hours to fully complete the campaign including expansions, so not much of an issue."
15057,It's an awesome RPS!
15058,"This game rules. I wrote a long ass review on Amazon on why I love it and maybe I will copy it here one day. Basically though, this game is just flat out fun. All the guns; killing everything with those guns, watching baddies explode. The art style, the humor, the comedy, the cool introductions; the thrill from barely surviving and coming back to wipe everything out. The flexibility with your skill points, the story is not the greatest but it is decent enough to make your playthrough more interesting as you blast boss after boss. The game is a good old time that will keep you playing for hours."
15059,cool
15060,"GET IT!!!
"
15061,Best game ever......
15062,"Surprisingly fun for someone who doesn't play RPGs. Takes a while to get going, so ignore the first hour or two."
15063,"A very fun game, highly recommended. To get max fun, play online, and you have to have a huge desire for kill, loot, repeat, until your the absolute best. That will never happen though. Its bazillions of guns may seem unbelivable, but that is the truth. No 2 guns are the same. You will always have a chance of finding better stuff. Fighitng: never boring. Enemeis are always varied in stats and can range fom normal to badass to an elemental, say corrosive. 9/10"
15064,"This is a rather fun FPS with RPG elements.  It can be played solo and as co-op campaign which you can drop in and out of, which is a nice feature of the co-op.  Lots of fun features and many many different yet simular guns.  If you like shooters then you should definately consider giving this game a go.  If you do go for the game of the year version too."
15065,"A strong contender for 'Worst FPS this Generation' and for ""Worst FPS of all time"". Boring beyonds word. This game is devoid of any fun and is immediately forgettable."
15066,"At this reduced price, you can't say no"
15067,"dont buy this game because it a nice game and you have 2 pay for this xD and you dont have money xxD

15072,Good fun
15073,FUCKING GREAT GAME.
15074,Great game to play with some gamers
15075,"Sau geiles Game, und mit entsprechenden Mitspielern im Coop um ein tausendfaches besser... einfach ein Must-Have für Shooter Freunde"
15076,I bought this new and its STILL fun to play with friends. Never ending loot and tons of replay value!
15077,Reommend all content have played many times...pick up on sales.
15078,Love it
15079,"A really fun and crazy shooter which lets you customize your character according to your playing style.
Even more fun if you have friends to play with."
15080,"Open World RPG slash FPS is a good summary for Borderlands but the game is so much more then that. 

You are a Vault Hunter on the barren wastelands of planet Pandora. Do a few good deeds, kill the occasional Skag and many Thugs encountered along the way in your pursuit of some mythical treasure called The Vault.

Common with roguelikes and dungeon crawlers is Borderlands progressive and randomized loot system in which defeated enemies will drop newer weaponry and equipment. 

With 4 different character classes each with a unique special ability and 3 seperate skill trees provides gives a flexible gameplay system with lots of replay value for different character builds.

I'm not a big First Person Shooter fan but I definitely recommend Borderlands.

"
15081,A bazillion guns that you end up selling because they all suck.
15082,Really nice game! :) Enjoy.
15083,"Aged. 

Still bangin"

all of them."
15085,"It's like if Fallout, Halo and Gears of War had a deformed Child, and Borderlands was the brother of that deformed child."
15086,"No, honestly, I wish I discovered this game earlier. It's definitely #1 I played in 2011. A++ WOULD BUY AGAIN, derp."

Great game cool graphics. If you want to have fun now that it is on sale pick up this game you won't be disappointed. If you want to play multiplayer please PM me."
15089,"One of my top 10 of all time. This game is brilliant, deep, and highly engaging. Highly recommended."
15090,Very Fun. played this on Xbox360 with my cousin. Definitely worth getting.
15091,"Pretty great COOP game if you can get a group to do the entire thing. It isn't a single player game though. Yes, you can play by yourself, but you'll get bored. Level scaling is also terrible. It's pretty hilarious, worth checking out if you can get  a good group to play with."
15092,"Great game, with a friend you can play this co-op for hours on end. ALL THOSE GUNS!"
15093,"Good game up til level 45 or so. Then it gets extremely drawn out, missions are spread out over long distances without the ability to teleport like in earlier missions. Best to get is during a Steam Sale when its like 4.99. Oh and don't buy Mad Moxxi's Under Dome DLc unless you have friends to play the game with, otherwise it will be a waste of your money."
15094,"Shooter-Game mixed with the item system of an ActionRPG like Diablo.
Those two genres fall perfectly into place in this game."

15098,"Esse jogo é legal, mas ele fica muito enjoativo depois de um tempo, eu não consegui continuar jogando depois de zerar, nem joguei os DLCs por não aguentar mais o jogo.

Apesar disso eu recomendo este jogo, vale a jogatina."
15099,"Awesome game, especially with multiplayer co-op. If you don't have a highpower laptop or a desktop you'll probably have to turn the settings down though. It's gorgeous if you can run it at full settings though!"
15100,"Awesome pack, awesome game. Some net issues sometimes, but overall a must-have!"
15101,"Cel shading, invisible magic girls, snipers with hawk pets, beef sticks that punch things to death and a black guy with a deployable turret, diablo style questing and lots of sexual innuendos. What's not to love?"

15105,Fun if you have 3 friends to run through with. There's little depth otherwise. The DLC isn't so good.
15106,"A really fantastic game - beautiful graphics, almost endless combinations and possibilities. A really vast world. Get it."
15107,Tons of guns!  A loot-fest in the same vein as Diablo 2.
15108,"sick game in a good way combining shooter with free-roam RPG its just insane and co-op makes it even better dood
"
15109,All of the grind of an MMORPG without all the other players!
15110,Damn worth the buy off Steam when its in the sale!!! and watch out for Borderlands 2 next year!!!
15111,Comicbook meets FPS.  Worth Getting.
15112,Has very little amount of dick.
15113,Hack&SlashをFPSにしたらこうなる。良いセン行ってるけど残念ながらメーカー・パブリッシャの押しが足りなかったように思う。あとDLC商法やめてください。
15114,truly unique! the dialogue writers are comedic geniuses. you will be fully immersed in this game.
15115,Most fun I've ever had playing a FPS.......BAR NONE.
15116,"The whole ""Diablo with Guns"" quote pretty much sums Borderlands up. Except for the massive lack of story for the base game. You're after keys to the Vault, so you can get rich quick. Why are our intrepid aventurers after the power, glory, fame, and money? Who knows, Gearbox forgot to write that part, or any compelling narative for that matter. The DLC helps to address this issue, putting a slight more emphasis on plot, though it still lacks any sort of motivation for the characters or player.

Apart from the gaping holes in the game, the graphics are fantastic and substitutes style for definition with fabulous cellshaded comic book style graphics. The gameplay works for the most part though the millions of guns on whole lack a real feel for difference between them gives it a real skinner box feel.

Overall it is enjoyable to play with friends in tow, though there is little reason to play this game with strangers."
15117,GG
15118,gandon
15119,Unique and fun!
15120,One of the most fun games my wife and I ever played.
15121,Love this.
15122,Awesome fun ... Would recommend this over Rage anyday .
15123,"A very exciting and entertaining RPG FPS. All of the varieties of guns make gameplay very entertaining; the weapon crates are like opening a treasure chest. However, the differences between guns does tend to get less distinct as you continue in the game; a sniper with +45% accuracy isn't too different from one with +40% accuracy and +5% fire rate. The setting and quests, though colorfully done, do get very old after a while and seem quite repetitive. Overall a fun shooter game though."
15124,87 bazillion guns is a pretty good estimate.
15125,Most satisfying wasteland experience on PC. TONS of phat gun loot.
15126,Dritbra spel
15127,Great online experience if you play it with your friends :D
15128,"Is a greate coop  and hilarious  game, with a mixt between RPG / FPS, and i mentioned? IS FUKING hilarious !!!!"
15129,"Borderlands is an awesome experience if you can find friends to play it with. All characters have a unique flavor to them, and the game reaches its full potential when all classes are in play. I remember the many nights I spent with three other friends playing through the game's many levels. This game would work well for someone who's looking for an RPG version of, say, Left 4 Dead."
15130,"Boring alone, awesome with friends!"
15131,"*Gnome Seal of Approval*
1st person shooter with RPG elements. Four classes to choose from, experience gain and talent trees. This is a sandbox game where you pick up missions and visit locations in a post-apocalyptic world. Enemies respawn, but not too often.
The game uses a cartoonish visual style which some people like, others don't.

The negative:
Unfortunatly, the game wasn't interesting enough for me to try more than one class and one playthrough. I seem to remember one playthough took about 20 hours (which is normal for these kind of games)."
15132,Play this with friends...That's the best advice for this game.
15133,Fun little distraction
15134,"For a brilliant time collecting guns, firing guns, trading guns, getting shot with guns and guns for pretty much breakfast, lunch and dinner, look no further than Borderlands. Great game to enjoy with your mates and with each different character having their own unique skills, a sense of teamwork is really present. I preferred Borderlands 1 compared to 2 as I felt that there is more of a concentration on loot in this game. The large lists of multicolored gun names in your inventory felt like it supported that, I was more excited to see what gun I would acquire next in this game than in any other iteration of Borderlands. With that being said, the variation of firearms (with their physical appearances and abilities taken into account) does pale in comparison to that of borderlands 2. The DLC packs are highly recommended too, adding hours of fun quests to do (Secret Armoury a top priority, as it adds Raid Boss: Crawmerax and Pearlescent legendary weapon drops)."
15135,"With it's unique graphics and RPG elements it's a fantastic game which caters to a variety of gaming styles. It'll keep you entertained for hours regardless if you're in single or co-op mode. Buy it, also DLC is great :D
""Oh look, a gun! I want it in my face!"""
15136,there's more dlc than there is actual content in the game
15137,"why cant i hold all these guns?

good fun game"
15138,"This game was good for a while until you started looking at the poster and we were like wtf is up with that guy with the finger in the head and the splatter pattern window out to the world.
Don't buy it, man."
15139,"Think WoW/TLOTRO meets The Chronicles Of Riddick, lotsa scary monsters, lotsa blood, an some nice big boss monsters to take on, :-)

Still a classic to play even now. Just a shame that you can't carry all your characters and gear onto the other games."
15140,Redneck Role Playing Game sandbox with way too many weapons and way too much fun.
15141,its the shit
15142,"BROLANDS! Love this game, own it on XBOX 360 and here, have all the DLC here though. Great fun, plenty of lols to be had. About to get a sequel. 

Play this one for FPS Diablo (random loot drop) fun, but otherwise the sequel sounds like it's going to be even more awesome.

DLC was pretty cool, definitely added more challenge, never finished it all though. Eventually just got tired of it, less of a comment about the game though and more of a comment about my ADD tendency to jump between games."
15143,"
"
15144,8.5/10
15145,Sooooooooooooo Fun. A great and unique game.
15146,This is a GREAT buy.  MUST have for Co-op fun!
15147,"There is a disappointing lack of variety in this game, but it's also surprisingly and confusingly addictive."
15148,"Not one of the best co-op games out there, but i enjoyed playing it non the less."
15149,"If Diablo was a first person shooter, It would be Borderlands."
15150,hnnnnffff
15151,"GOTY edition is worth picking up for 5-10$, will provide about that much entertainment. While the game can be played solo, the most joy is held in co-op with up to 4 player total support. The cel-shaded gfx are done in a fashionable and clever manner. Even the FPS-RPG cross-over is handled well. However, the games postmortem is stepped in problematic grind mechanics, an uninspired un challanging final boss and replay being left to more grinding and a ""multiple-playthrough"" mechanic that is more boorish than talking about classic lit with an english professor. Buy when cheep, and have friends that can trudge through the trenches with you. This having been said, I'm very interested to see if they can learn from Borderlands and improve Borderlands 2."
15152,"120 hours and still playing it.
Exelent game."
15153,"Ridiculously addictive game!  Four characters, two of which are pwn.. the others are ok.  Co-Op is how to play this game.  Solo can be fun but tedious.  Get some Steam friends and go kill everything you see...  Enjoy the weapons cuz there are millions and they are everywhere!  Enjoy!  A definite awesome purchase!"
15154,Its a good Game But you Cant Just Run out and shoot shit you need to Learn to Fight better then you can Shoot shit
15155,"Dear god, never again will i have time for anything else other than this game.......that's how fun it is."
15156,"This game is hands-down wicked fun.  The Cell-shaded graphics are a bit of a turnoff at first, but you get used to them after a while, and the gameplay is just a run-and-gun blast.   Story is funny and fun, side missions are decent and the cutscenes are very well done.    You add some friends to the mix in the full-on co-op mode of the single player campaign, and you will have a ton of fun."
15157,"A deep and addictive marriage between a shooter and an RPG. The elemental weapons are super fun, and Claptrap is very amusing."
15158,"MOOOOOOOOOOOOOEEEE


(and that's about as good as it gets i'm afraid)"
15159,"An amazing FPS, with an RPG element. There are tons of enemies, weapons, and quests.  A solid campaign, with some great narration. It is well optimized for low end PC's. Another 4-player co-op, that gets better the more you play. There are plenty of additional DLC's that add little side missions to the game. Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a good shooter.

Rating: 8.5/10"
15160,Fun role-play shooter with 4 player co-op. Only problem is that you need to stay close to friend's levels in order to play on their quest line.
15161,охуительная игра жду не дождусь втарую часть
15162,"Superb time-waster if you're into RPG stuff. Million combinations of arsenal will satisfy any Rambos or headhunters out there. Good Co-Op, but can easily be played on solo mode too. DLC's give you additional hours of fun."
15163,"its very good game ,also good coop and fun :)
"
15164,Oddly this game is alot of fun. The graphics are different and the storyline isn't perfect but its loads of fun. Plus the online co op is amazing and there is so much to do with the weapons. Plus its a long game and full of action and most of all crazy humor. A must have for all insane gamers.
15165,"Borderlands: GOTY English:

Well, the game is wonderful to be a mixture of RPG with FPS, mixing two kinds of games just played today. The game has four classes that are represented by a character within the game, each with their expertise. This version of the game is at a fair price that comes with the game with his fourth DLC's. The history of the game itself is great, my only thing against it was the wrong story development, besides that, the game is wonderful.

Borderlands: GOTY Portuguese:

Bem, o jogo é maravilhoso por ser uma mistura de RPG com FPS, mistura duas modalidades de jogos muito jogadas hoje em dia. O jogo tem 4 classes que são representadas por um personagem dentro do jogo, cada um com sua especialização. Esta versão do jogo, se encontra em um preço justo que acompanha o jogo com suas 4 DLC's. A história do jogo é ótima em si, minha única coisa contra, foi o mal desenvolvimento da história, fora isso, o jogo é maravilhoso."
15166,Booyah
15167,"Nice fps and rpg in this game.  Like fallout but cartoonish, It's a great buy!"
15168,Borderlands rocks my world! I grew up playing a Swedish post-apocalyptic pen and paper RGP called Mutant and this brings those memories back to life. This is one great mix of 1st person shooter and RPG. I find it very enjoyable. The weapons are fun as all heck and you agonize over what to specialize in and which weapons to equip over others. Fun stuff.
15169,"Great game,still like to play it :)"
15170,Giocateci!
15171,"The Plot wasn't  that great, but everything else is fantastic, plus it takes around 30 hours to beat the base game, and the dlc just adds more time to that. So its a great game if you want replayability."
15172,fuck ya
15173,С друзьями очень даже прикольно проходить эту игру)
15174,"Went to new places, met new people, and killed them. Destroyed the Destroyer for the win. 

It's Bordlerlands, buy the GOTY edition, play it, win!"
15175,This game is wierd but good
15176,great game! its almost like a first person diablo 2! lots of level grinding and weapon searches makes for a fun time especially when you have a group of friends to play with (which would be my recommended way to play this game)
15177,"If you like Diablo and shooters, buy this game.....nao! It can get really addicting."
15178,meshing the fps and rpg is what brought me here. excellent. co-op a huge plus.
15179,"Borderlands is awesome! I had so much fun playing it. The main game in and of itself is decent, but the DLC makes it an epic experience. The game can be summed up as Fallout meets Diablo. The game structure is in the style of Fallout in that there's lot of quests to complete for the main story and side missions. The story is even like Fallout 3 in reverse. The goal is to get entry into a vault. It's like Diablo because there's such an emphasis on finding loot. There's less emphasis on character progression and more on finding better gear. The visual style is done with cartoony cel-shading that always a treat for the eyes. There's a dune buggy to travel around the land in and it's always fun to roadkill enemies. BL can be quite funny at times and the characters are amusing, however the plot is paper-thin. Also, BL has the dubious honor of having the worst ending of all time. The DLC fixes that, though, and BL is about the journey anyway, not the destination."
15180,More guns than any one army could handle.  A little too much on the grindy side but good fun nonetheless.
15181,"Play this game, it has kept me more busy than any other game I have ever played.
Play it, Own it, Rock it."
15182,"This game had loot crates way before it was ""cool"" and you don't have to spend a penny to open them.

But seriously, if you like shooters and loot hunting, Borderlands is for you."
15183,"This game came out in 2009 and I still play it. It is one of my top favorite games of all times. It has so much replay value and it just keeps bringing you back for more, especially with all the DLC."
15184,"It's a good game, great in online and awesome with friends."
15185,"Awesome graphics, and gameplay. Makes you want to start another play-thru as soon as you finish the first!"
15186,"I came to this party late, but it's a nice party."
15187,yihaaa partner! lets kill them all all the way levels to earn and skills to add! you drive i eat chips! you kill i eat cookies! you finish the quest i wil be inside the toilet! its the best game ever! if you are a bit to lazy!
15188,das ist der beste comic-shooter den ich je gespielt habe xD
15189,A must-have for FPS and RPG fans the like! A very engaging and fun game with a unique visual flair.
15190,Fun!
15191,Very fun. Even better when you get the DLCs. Good to play with friends too.
15192,"Fun blend of RPG and FPS. Not to mention, the game is hilarious!"
15193,Light story with great humor. Fun shooting.
15194,"Dark humor, wacky gameplay. You honestly can't go wrong with this one!"
15195,"Since I'm quite obsessive-compulsive, Borderlands is the perfect game for me. I've spent way too much time trying to find that perfect gun. I haven't found it yet, but it's out there somewhere, sitting in a weapon crate, just waiting for my greedy little hands to pick it up and put it to good use. Also, 270+ hours and only three pearlescent guns? That sucks, and it makes me want to play more. I need to find that perfect pearlescent flame/acid/lightning gun. It's the only way I'll ever stop playing. 

God damn this time-sucking anxiety spectrum disorder simulator of a game."
15196,"Greetings costumer!
Good games are now available at the steam store."
15197,"Very, very awesome."
15198,Best Role Playing Shooter to date!

15201,"excellent game for both fps players and rpg loot whores, buddy up and take on pandora"
15202,Sniper rifles that set people on fire!  What else could you ask for from a game?
15203,"This game is amazing, it takes a bit to get into it, but once you hit that sweet spot, you're in for the long haul. The guns are your rewards, and let me tell you, there's PLENTY of them. The dialogue is my favorite aspect of the game. I can't tell you how many times i've just busted out laughing at a character's one-liner. Play by yourself or with friends online. Oh, and when you get off a succession of headshots, it's pretty satisfying. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys shooters but wants something a little different than the run of the mill point and shoot game."
15204,"only fun with friends, then you hit max level and there's nothing to do anymore."

15213,Great Stuff!
15214,Yes. Just yes.
15215,Hours and hours and hours of pleasurable gameplay. It's totally worth it!
15216,"like fallout3, a bit more cartooney and colorful, not as depressive. Feels like it was made more for consoels then pc's, but good mediocre fun nonetheless..gwab it when its cheap! the 4 different DLCs add 4 new areas. Should be played with friends."
15217,"Psycho, Burning Psycho, Midget Psycho, Badass Psycho... Fuck 'em all!"
15218,"A post-apoc ""dungeon crawler"" with countless randomized (and unique) guns. Fantastic when co-op with friends (or even with random people online since there is a lobby system) but boring as hell solo. With a lengthy main campaign, a multitude of sidequests, and a variety of character kit customization options, the core game will keep you occupied for a while. 4 DLCs (of varying quality) add significant gameplay changes and offer loads of new toys to collect. Definitely a lot of bang-for-your-buck considering how cheap it is now!"
15219,"Highly recomanded, really fun game. Also get Knoxx's DLC"
15220,"Diablo 2 plus Mad Max equals borderlands, but with less cracked bardiches. Damn fine shooting, neat environments, and cool special abilities. Also, guns guns guns!"
15221,Played since release and still play from time to time. Great humor and gameplay is awesome.
15222,This game rocks.
15223,Great game!
15224,"Extremely stylistic FPS with tongue in cheek humour (humor for all you Americans!). Mission based gameplay with lots of loot to pick up. A plethora of guns are at your disposal, and with a hefty list of challenges and achievements, this game has some great lasting power. Lookgin forward to duel-wielding in number 2!"

15235,"I didn't like this game at first but it has grown on me... a bit.... once i got it running smoothly and built up my charecter past lv 10 and figured out you cant easily kill enemies of a higher level, The game really starts to open up. So if you like your action arcade style and can put up with the cell shaded world and your charecter vocally celebrating all his critical hits... then you might like this... maybe.

15246,A really fun fps. Even better if you mess with the cfg files a little xD
15247,"though i find it rude for them to release both the dlc and the game in a price cheaper to buy them seprately, this game was very good for my taste.  I don't care how hard you hate on this game it kept me to no life on it for DAYS.  did i eventually get bored of it yes. i will admit it.  did people say the beta was better?  i only have one picture to go off of.

this game is good for people wanting a shooter/rpg mashup.  it will keep you entertained for the time i'll garentee it.  but yes, it's cel shaded so what?  people need to realize that sometimes graphics aren't the games flaw unless they do something that's gamebreaking, like streatching of polys across yer screen or glitched up errors that make it look like your high.  

aside from that, that's all to it, really based on weather or not you like a combination of said generes."
15248,"jogo muito bom
"
15249,nice only if u play on line....after a short time its geting boring
15250,"TL;DR Shoot, Loot, Laugh, Repeat

One of the best multiplayer games ive played. Each weapon drop is randomly generated from over 10 materials so no 2 guns will be the same, even if they have the same name! Elemental weapons, 4 classes/PC, humor, and claptraps (if u like droids u like claptraps). While there are some annoyances (its formated for consoles, not pc) they dont detract (no minimap) from the overall (fast travel could be faster) experiance (scooter is named after his sister) of the game.

DLC: can extend the game a bit, and u get more time with the side charicters. worth it on sale

That being said Randy Pitchford (head of Gearbox) stole the art style from an artist, and didnt compensate or even hire them. He has done more shady things since."
15251,정말 재미는 있는데 같이 코옵할사람이 없어 !
15252,"Solo is decent, co-op is a TON of fun. Campaign is a solid length and customization options are a blast. Highly recommended for 2-4 players!"
15253,A 4 player Open world MMO? yea it is plenty to do in this vast wasteland but i just cant get past the shitty Graphics.
15254,"This is a first person shooter. Wait, no. This is a role playing game. Wait, no. This is a first person role playing shooter!"
15255,"One of THE best first person shooter/RPG's ever made. Four different characters to play, each with their own styles and each character can be grown as you play in many directions to suit your own personal style. Great style to the game, silliness abounds and keeps you entertained all the way through and the game only gets better when played with friends, the more, the merrier!"
15256,"After revisiting Borderlands on PC, compared to PS3, there is such a ridiculious change! Not only is the graphics alot better but it seems the gameplay is more intense, and with Borderlands 2 coming out early 2012 i cant ask for much more! Better get my practice on now that 2 of my friends have now got back into it as well...."
15257,                               ~<3~<3 BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! ~<3~<3
15258,It's Borderlands.
15259,this is so fun :) not many players any more.. :)
15260,Best with friends. Play the sequel immediately after for an unforgettable experience.
15261,"Probably the first RPG element FPS game I've played and I must say it's pretty good. Most people might hate it for the cartoonish graphics but that aside, the feeling of learning new abilities really adds an interesting thing to a FPS. It is a very slow starting game but once you get past the first starting area the game really picks up."
15262,"Right off the bat, don't play this if you're looking for a single player game with lots of story or you don't have any friends.  Without at least one co-op partner, Borderlands will seem very, very lonely.  Assuming you do have a gaming partner (my wife is mine), this game can be a lot of fun.  

You can choose one of four characters to play: Roland, Lilith, Mordecai and Brick.  All of them can wield the same weapons and do melee attacks as well, but some characters are better utilized with some weapons than others.

The basic premise is paper-thin as you're a bounty hunter/mercenary/treasure hunter (and whatever else) looking for fame and fortune by finding something called ""the vault.""  On the way, you'll discover numerous towns, meet lots of unusual people, and fight tons of psychos and monsters.

You can play offline, LAN or online.  You can use the same character offline or online, but beware: if you level up too far beyond your teammates, the game will hassle you about it."
15263,"You play as a guy who goes and gets a job o a planet as a bannana salesman then you go out in the desert and you get dick slapped by a monkey then it scraches its balls and runs then you go into a protal and then when you comeout and this guy say baked beans fall in a kitchen and no ones around do the baked beans make a noise  and you answer yes and he says yea ok go pickles boobs you ain game not jk go foward then noco belic says i likemeat balls then you have to kill him then you fight a guy named sledge hammer in my ballsack then you kill him and you win.I give this game a 5/900000000000000
"
15264,Game of the Year. Nuff said. I still plays it every once a while
15265,"A fun co-op FPS. Has a comical feeling akin to Trigun, with a futuristic western such as Firefly."
15266,"If you want a game that's completely balls-to-the-wall insane*, with irreverent humor, a colorful cast, and literally more guns than you can count (number of different models of guns currently counted at over 17,750,000**), this is for you!  Make sure to get the Game of the Year edition to maximize the carnage!

*This was written before the second game came out, and while this game is not the complete mind-screw that Borderlands 2 is, it's still pretty crazy!
**May not actually be counted."
15267,Possibly the best Co-op game ever
15268,s'good
15269,"First Person Shooter? Yes. 
Loot up the wazoo? Yes.
Crazy bosses and sense of humor? Check.
"
15270,Shot and shot some more.
15271,"Very well made, top notch."
15272,"What a great and enjoyable game this is. If you like shooting and fun prepare for a 30+hours game of arcade RPG FPS. It's strange, because it's funny, there's a lot of bullets flying around and it's not realistic at all, yet, it's a very fun game indeed. I Recomend this after finishing a 30-40 hour game, just because I wanted to explore a lot!"
15273,"OMG if you dont have this or have never played it .... buy it now, its a little slow by yourself but wien co-op'd ... probably one of the best games ever made."
15274,"Great game on the first playthrough, gets boring after that. Story line is alright but progress is slow especially if you are soloing. All the DLC are worth while and entertaining."
15275,"If you've got someone to play this with, it's an excellent game. Solo, it's a little repetitive.
"
15276,"RPG and FPS at the same time. Full of jokes. Is there anything more you want?

This game is pretty damn good. May even be better than Borderlands 2."
15277,"Buy if you like 

- loots and guns
- FPS with a solid campaign"
15278,"Game of the Month: AUGUST (sorry this came a little late >_<)

First got this for the Xbox 360, but I find it actually plays better on Steam (yeah I'm slowly becoming a PC gamer, so wut? :B)

Featuring a wide arsenal of weapons, trippy graphical style, humourous characters, and killer DLC, Borderlands might be simple in story and gameplay, but is a complete blast.

Never get tired of it, no matter how many heads I blow off or zombies I punch out.
At a fairly low price, you can't go wrong with Borderlands"
15279,great game  love it
15280,Fun as hell Multiplayer!!
15281," Borderlands is an incredibly fun and highly replayable game. The storyline and mission log are enough to keep you busy for a good long time, however I find that the added material such as a near endless collection of unique weapon drops (think Diablo if it were an FPS) and a strong class customization system is what brings me back each time I play. I picked this up again as a 4-pack while it was on a 75% sale on Steam after not playing it since 2009, and I'm very glad I did. This time around I'm playing a lot more coop with my friends and it adds another level of enjoyment I didn't think was even possible. If you don't have this game, you should definitely buy it. It's worth every penny, even at full price!"
15282,"A very fun, FPS that doesn't take it self too seriously. Guns are random drops with random stats / mods and you never what your going to get. Co-Op can be a blast."
15283,Like playing a saturday morning cartoon...
15284,my midget nightmares come true!
15285,"Very original visual style that adds a lot to the presentation, but beyond that I didn't find much reason to continue playing. The singleplayer got repetitive, and the multiplayer always lagged and seemed like an after thought. The gameplay involves lots of scrolling through menus and inventory screens which I found distruptive to the flow. I only recommend this game to loot-happy FPS-RPG fans."
15286,"As i become more and more a older grumpy jilted gamer, i find myself jumping from one game to the next not really being engaged in anything substancial like back in the doom, dune, diablo, half life 2 days. So when i stumbled across this lil fella i thought... ""a cell shading knock off fallout 3?! this will be crap"". 

So now after ive put in about 120 hours into this title i can now say its a fantastic suprise. It engaged me quite well, and i quickly ran back to the ps3 after work to carry on the adventure. I enjoyed this far more then i did fallout 3 so i would recommend a look to anyone, but if you do get it i would recommend putting in some serious hours early as the start is a lot harder then most of the game.

Its not aging very well so get in soon!

9.0 from me."
15287,"One of my favorite co-op experiences... though it is deeply and heartbreakingly flawed by interface errors, poor design choices, and the occassional bug especially in multiplayer.

It's a great game and I encourage you to try it if you have a buddy to play through it with you, but be warned that it is unfriendly in the strongest sense of the word to drop in, drop out play.
But it's worth your time! Really!"
15288,"If you've been living under a rock, you'd not hear of Borderlands. A four-player co-operative game that has since received four expansions and turns into one of the most enjoyable friend-oriented games released in the past few years.

The open environment in combination with random diablo-esqe drops provides for repeating runs and with the release of the expansions that really double the size of the campaign to include the likes of General Knoxx and Claptrap's Robot Revenge, and you've got a fairly long campaign that will keep you busy.

There are minor problems with the PC build in that Gamespy is a terrible provider, LAN and Hamachi would most definitely prove to work better than Gamespy itself, but once you manage to get people together it's an absolute blast to chip away at Pandora."
15289,A bit of mindless fun with some story thrown in. :D
15290,"was £4.99 for GOTY, HAH! Very fun, Can't wait for the sequal."
15291,"FPS version diablo, old but gold."
15292,Wanna shoot stuff? Wanna collect loot? Then play Borderlands. It's like a post-apocalyptic science-fiction first-person-shooter gunslinging Diablo II. With robots. (And get the GOTY edition--the DLC packs rock.)
15293,"Borderlands is pretty much what the spawn of Diablo and any shooter would be.Tons of (somewhat varied) guns,quests,money,enemies with levels to shoot at, co-op with up to 4 friends to shoot stuff with[strike](through gamespy....uuugh)[/strike],a level cap of 69(or 58 if you don't have one of the DLC's...more below),decent post-launch content and a nifty artistic direction makes this a decent shooter to play,if a bit slow on the start.

[strike]DLC's:See individual DLC's for opinion on those!(Short version:Get knoxx and robot revolution)[/strike]

Steamworks:Has steam Steam Achievements and cloud support that were added post release.

2018 edit:since the review was written, Gamespy was shutdown,with the MP backend replaced with Steamworks, and the first 2 DLCs had their DRM stripped, so they're all somewhat good to get now.

2019 edit: Now superseeded the ""GOTY Enhanced"" edition.
 
https://store.steampowered.com/app/729040/ 
 
Aside the nonsensical naming and higher sysreqs, everything said should still apply to it. And if you already own the GOTY edition, you should already have it in your library too."
15294,"More akin to Diablo than Fallout.  If you like looting and levelling, then this is the game for you!  Playing co-op (the more players the better) is the way to go since soloing will get boring quickly."
15295,Best. Game. EVER!
15296,Diablo 2 + FPS = fun.
15297,"Personally, after playing hundreds of hours of this game and having all DLC. I have to say, this game is one of the most badass RPG's I have ever played. FPS mixed with RPG elements, practically an infinite number of weapons from common to pearlescent rare (That's motherfuckin' rare to those who haven't played this game or gotten as far as to even find a pearlescent weapon) A choice of 4 characters, each DLC raised the level cap which is great. I think the level cap is either 69, or somewhere around 65 or so. I'm still not the highest level, but I shall reach it eventually. And with borderlands 2 coming out, well, it's always good to play the game that started it all. Give it a go, get some friends together, go solo, it's fun either way. Trust me, you'll have a blast. LITERALLY. xD"
15298,Great game!
15299,It's a great FPSRPG with people you can shoot to make red stuff and loot come out. The game is also great when a generous person gifts it to you.
15300,"Guns, Ammo and bad puns. What more do you need as you travel the borderlands in order to massacre living and non-living things. The amount of gore provided as you slaughter humanoids, robots and creatures of all types will keep your inner 'Damien' satiated until Borderlands 2 arrives!  8/10"
15301,"Lots of fun if you can get some friends together to play at the same level, but playing solo gets old fast.
Joining a public game is a pain, because you can't tell until after you join whether the connection is any good, and a lot of people in public games are ass-hats who vacuum up all the loot as fast as they can, or play with someone high level to make things easier AKA not fun."
15302,"Awesome, awesome and awesome."
15303,"Great game. Cartoon style graphics remind me of XIII (another good game) on Playstation2. Can't wait until Borderlands 2 comes out, just hope that's as good! ;)"
15304,"269h+ played 

Broken, discontinued version.

Basically just salt on a wound..."
15305,FUN AS HELL GAME!!!!!!
15306,Awesome game
15307,"At the moment...BEST. GAME. EVER. I'm seriously having a hard time trying to find something I don't like about this game...I like the cartoonish visuals, the overall gameplay, the characters and their special abilities, the quests/missions, the weapons (oooohh the weapons...all million of em, and I'm not even exaggerating...in my 100 hours so far I doubt I've come across a duplicate so far :D). Basically, if you're looking for a fun shooter with rpg elements then look no further, don't even think, just get it :D"
15308,Great game I will def get part 2 coming out
15309,Fun game that provides a lot of hours of entertainment.
15310,"Great fun, especially with friends."
15311,"GUNZ BLAZIN' SHOOT EM UP ACTION! WOOO HOOO! Best played with friends, and drugs of one kind or another."
15312,Coole Sache das Spiel! :D
15313,"Guns, guns, guns, guns, guns. Gotta love this game if you love variety in your weapons. The skills are fun and each character has their own personal feel. It plays a lot like Diablo 2 in a simplified way. Make no mistake though, this game is not dumbed down, you will be expected to navigate weapon bonuses and effects like a pro to get the most bang for your buck. In the end, the mess you make of your enemies is totally worth it."
15314,Best game ever!
15315,"Fun FPS with looting system.
Extra fun while playing with your friends."
15316,"Just solid good time. At first I was a bit critical that the skill system was too simplistic, but the gameplay longevity has since won me over... It's an FPS at the CORE with rpg drizzled on top, (not the other way around eg. Mass Effect), which means I can play for hours and hours and still feel like shotgunning mobs to the face stays 'a blast'.

Also one of the only games to offer great co-op marathons.If you remember enjoying Diablo at LAN parties, and you've been waiting for that experience in an FPS package, you should totally enjoy this game."
15317,I herd joo leik random?
15318,"If you haven't played this, you're missing a lot. It's actually a game you can play to genuinely spend time with your friends!"
15319,"Shittons of weapons. Check
Hilarious Plotlines. Check
People talking about dick. Check
Cel shaded motherfuckers will be out to blast your black ass best be keepin your pants off for this one. Because you will jerk it"
15320,Great Game but it cant beat Dead Island! 7/10
15321,GASTAÇÃO garantida!
15322,"The game is a lot of fun, just has some issues.

15323,"Appealing art style, satisfying gunplay and very broad weapon variety make for an entertaining FPS hybrid with RPG elements. Quest design is rather simplistic, though."
15324,The most fun to be had in a co-op game.
15325,"Purchased at $10

Playing with random pubs absolutely breaks this game. Play with friends, or by yourself. It's best enjoyed if you only do the quests that offer rewards that will benefit you substantially, and ignore the low level stuff. The game becomes painfully boring if you try to do 100% of everything. It's ultimately up to you to keep the challenge consistent, due to the massive leveling up."
15326,"Sick game, Freakin addicted to it!"
15327,This game made history!It has a random weapon creating system that literally creates millions of weapons!The story is great!The gameplay is innovative:it features a mix of RPG and FPS called Role-Playing Shooter!
15328,"이거남자라면
친구랑꼭해봐야되는게임"
15329,Play this awesome loot infested coop fps now!!
15330,"'Its Diablo II with guns' is something said often about this game, and while it is 100% accurate, it fails to deliver on just how much -fun- that concept is. The two game styles - the shoot anything that looks at you funny and the kill things to make shinies pop out - blend seemlessly together in a way that makes me wonder why someone didn't do this sooner!

The visual style is neat, the gameplay is smooth an enjoyable, and there are infact way too many guns to count all of which are useable by the four characters to meet their style or to shore up a falling in the same. A good game to get, especially considering its routine packaging of all its DLC in the GotY edition."
15331,"Described by some as ""gun porn"" because of the rediculous number of variations of weapons found throughout. A simple, no nonsense semi sci-fi cyberpunk shooter which works really well in coop mode especially with the scaling enemies. Diablo in 1st person."
15332,Hundreds of enemies + Millions of guns + 3 friends = Tons of fun!
15333,One of those games that you can't stop playing
15334,ITs a BeAsT
15335,sure is a game
15336,AWESOME
15337,"Think Fallout, with crazy enemies, randomized weapons and funny humor. It's awesome!"
15338,get you one
15339,This game makes me dream about a Fallout game with Co-op.
15340,"It's like a MMORPG, but without the massive and it plays more like a first-person shooter (FPS) with role-playing elements. You can choose up to 4 types of characters and level them according to your style of action. Although there are no decisive choices to be made, Borderlands plays more like quest-filled open world that you can invite your friends to and have a great time. The game also supports single player, but it should be noted that most of the DLC packs rely on cooperative gameplay since they are far more challenging than the main game's quests. In all, Borderlands is truly unique with its comic-like graphics and healthy blend of FPS and RPG. No subscription fees required!"
15341,Awesome ^^
15342,Very fun and addicting
15343,Borderlands makes me think of my Uncle Charles.
15344,"Проект получился на гора, стильная графика, отличное музыкальное сопровождения, понятная система прокачки, огромное количество оружия, но всю картину портит, одно ""но"", как таковой сюжет у этого проекта отсутствует напрочь, и за всю игру вы не встретите ни одного запоминающегося персонажа, игру нельзя проходить одному это просто противопоказано ибо происходящее на экране покажется вам настолько нудным и однообразным, что вы впадёте в глубокое отчаяние, так, что подключайте своих друзей и вперёд, веселье будет гарантированно."
15345,"This game belongs to category MUST HAVE. Graphical style is the essential part of a game and, I think, its main feature. Borderlands drags you into for a long time and offers you a really long play time with infinite variations of weapons and big numbers of quests"
15346,it good!
15347,"Possibly the most underrated game of all time, borderlands has made use of the RPG element and the FPS element making a totally unique game. With just over thousands of different weapons to choose from the game's atleast worth a try for every hardcore FPS fan."
15348,"My first Steam recommendation... yes, it's that good.

I'm not into post-apocalyptic settings (e.g. Mad Max-esque), but Borderlands' charm and style far outweigh that personal preference.

Its remarkable cel-shading and hand-drawn textures are insanely beautiful. It feels like you're living inside a graphic novel. Also, the style of the characters' personalities is perfect, and with great voice-acting to boot.

If you don't own this game, you're doing yourself a great injustice. Get the GOTY and come shoot shit with us!"
15349,"정말 환상적인 게임이다! 애니를 보는듯한 예쁜 그래픽과 이국적  분위기의 광대한 맵들,
엄청난 무기들의 수와 각 무기들의 뚜렷한 특성들 & 적절한 타격감. 거기에다가 퀘스트 수행과 랩업의 보람까지. 이제까지 해 온 fps중 다섯손가락안에 꼽을만 하다"
15350,"The latest count of the number of guns in Borderlands is 17,750,000"
15351,"This game has enough to do from the main storyline to all four Downloadable Content (DLC) packs to keep you busy for a couple of weeks. Don't knock it 'til you try it, bro!"
15352,"This is what MMOs should try to be.
You have four classes: Berserker, Soldier, Hunter, and Siren. Each of them has a unique skill, you can earn skill points (Starting at level 5, you're forced to spend the first point unlocking your special skill) which you then spend to get other skills.
Skills range from improving your special to other things, like a Hunter skill that increases xp gained from crit kills or a Zerker skill that reduces recoil and reload time with weapons.
You can play solo, but that sucks, the main attraction is the multiplayer. You can have up to four players and just play through the story mode.
There are flaws that show what a cheap port it was, but mostly they can be ignored. There's also minor problems with hosting online games due to the stupid way it tries to punish low level players from cheating for levels, if you have a group of friends you want to play with, don't ever play without them. The game halfs exp gain if the host has finished missions you don't."
15353,This game is awsome if you have have the money .BUY IT!!!!
15354,Ain't no rest for the wicked!
15355,I whole-heartedly recommend this damn game! Should have bought it while it was on sale ;)

15358,GET IT
15359,"Borderlands is a superb blend of FPS and RPG elements (plus a fair amount of driving) set in an intriguing and often darkly hilarious universe. I ignored this game when it was initially released, because it looked to me like just another wasteland-themed FPS. That turned out to be an unfortunate generalization, and Borderlands was a pleasant surprise for me when I finally played it. One of the main features of the game is that you can play through the campaign with up to three other players. I have not experienced this as of writing this reccomendation, but the way the game is set up leads me to believe it would be an enjoyable experience.

Also, there are lots of guns.

Lots."
15360,Poop
15361,Further proof that the Diablo format isn't all that bad. It just needed a new interface.
15362,"nice game

15366,a game that must be play'd
15367,"Classic FPS in comicstyle.
Great Solo and Multiplayer."
15368,"As a single player, the game isn't the best thing out there. The play style feels closer to that of a mmo than a single player. But mix in some friends, and you can have a blast. Well as much fun as you can have co-op without being able to tk your friends."
15369,"This an excelent mix of FPS and RPG. For people who liked Diablo II back in the day and also enjoyed CS, TF2, or any other FPS this is a great game. It has solid FPS action and co-op play well blended with Diablo II style questing and character development.

And the humor is excelent. The stories of the main game and all of the expanstions are quite well written for the genere and there are planty of good jokes. Different parts of the game even parody each other to great effect."
15370,"amazing game, if you love fps and you love rpg's with huge open world exploring this is THE game for you"
15371,Game gets better as it goes. Open enough to be fun but not so much that you're running around all day after nothing. fantastic weapons drop/options.
15372,BAGAZILLION GUNZ
15373,.
15374,As a multiplayer co-operative game it's fun as hell.  As single player it's alright.  The end ing is really anti-climatic so be sure to pick up the DLC to get your fix and a more satisfying completion to the game.
15375,"Great Game, lots of replayability and alot of fun :D
"
15376,"This game is very good, yet VERY challenging. it's a great game and i love the hunter. hours of gameplay i iwsh i had gotten it sooner. Oh yea. an 87 bazillion guns to choose from. love it."
15377,"Awesome cell-shaded graphics, cool voice-over and music, make BL a real blast to play. Total loot-shooter (similar to Diablo). Tons of different weapon/stat combinations. And a fun (up to) 4-person online play."
15378,Best game EVER!
15379,"One of the greatest RPG Shooter's ever created and definately the best Co-op adventure ever created this game will entertain you for hours on end, from the high action gunfights to customising your equipment and upgrading your skill tree. The characters in this game have a great level of diversity from the four protagonists - Roland, Lilith, Brick and Mordecai to the mascot Claptraps. This game will not dissapoint you."
15380,"This is a very fun game if you have a friend playing it with you on co-op, it's slightly boring playing alone though."
15381,Epic!
15382,its an  awesome co-op game  try it
15383,"This game is good if you like to hold down W. Lacking gameplay. Walk here walk there. If you want to play online, run in Windows XP sp3 mode."
15384,"one of THE greatest games ive ever played. new style of graphics, moderate graphics, endless coop multiplayer gameplay. the games has tons of character and its amazing how far are large weopon inventory and a good sense of humor can take a game. LOVE IT. the game also allows you to fight your friends in the arena............... GET YOU ONE.."
15385,"This game truly is Diablo2 with guns. Very fun multiplayer with friends or random people(be warned no loot roll system) this game has alot of replay value with only very minor annoyances(crappy car controls, lame respawn rules for mobs) that do little to detract from the overall experience 8/10"
15386,Very fun
15387,Such an addicting game and so much fun single player or co-op. GET THIS NOW!
15388,Well I likes it. :-)
15389,"It's probably the closest game you're going to get that is Diablo 2 with guns.  That being said, get it!"
15390,A unique style :-) Love the cartoony style and the humor that's in the game... Just watch the trailer to see what i mean..
15391,"Hell of a Ride, BIG FUN"
15392,"Though the game lacks in in depth story and true character development, the play style and the world itself give this game a tremendous level of enjoyment. The character build system really lets you make your Treasure Hunter your own and can seriously cripple the difficulty curve over time. This world is definitely one I'd recommend others to discover (and hopefully run around with me in!)"
15393,Buy it
15394,This game is EPIC
15395,"If you don't play this game, we're not friends... no really already like 6 of us have this game (including myself). It's Fallout 3 meets Diablo 2 which makes Diablout 5."
15396,Very Very awesome game.
15397,"Great fun with your mates, just don't miss a session -or you'll be the guy with the pea-shooter while everyone else is on BFGs."
15398,AWESOME
15399,"Awesome game 
it has humour plus gore what more do you want also alot of WEAPONS"
15400,"A good game that's pretty fun. Not much of a story, but the style and game is entertaining. The character building system is fun, but the grind to get between levels can take awhile. Expansion packs are definitely worth it. So get it while it's on sale. Playing co-op is also definitely fun with friends.
"
15401,"One of the greatest Multiplayer games I've played. The Co-op is brilant, with just enough challange, but never to much to make it impossible. Amazing guns, cars, and enemies for endless fun. No real downside, some funky starting controls, but those can be changed. Not sure about single player, but I'm giving it a 9.5 out of 10 for Co-op!"
15402,Borderlands is a very fun game. I love that you can play the entire game via coop mode. There are so many different kinds of weapons it's actually a bit ridiculous that there are so many to choose from. The only downfalls I would have are that it gets repetitive at times and the difficulty on the coop difficulty is either too hard or too easy.
15403,"No! The greed has to stop somewhere. People, you can vote with your money! Don't buy the third!"
15404,It's kinda like Diablo with guns.
15405,"The game feels kinda dull if you play it seriously, it's better if you dick around and act like a tard with other people. The game is somewhat easy in multipalyer though, the only mildly challenging enemy is the crawmerax wich is the ""secret final boss"" as opposed to the disappointing ""final boss"" from the main game. Overall it's decent but it could have been way better like described in early pres info.  Hopefully the sequel will be better."
15406,"I cant believe I never wrote a review on this title. Plain and simple, awesome game to play with your buddies. RPG fun with morn style weapons.  Great addition to anyones game library. 
Bottom Line: Very nice game, great DLC to keep it alive 8 out of 10."
15407,"A great game with any number of friends, but it can get tiring after about 30-50 hours, and the multiplayer can be finicky; but it's still a blast. The DLC's are entertaining and add plenty to the gameplay, it's worth the full 30 bucks, never mind the 4.99 it's on sale for now."
15408,good fps fun!
15409,Digestible shooter with levelling. :/
15410,I loved this game.  With limited number of hours to play this managed to take most of them.  It is a FPS with just enough character classes and customization that you can play it the way you want.  Also has a nice blend of linear story and sandbox play.
15411,Best RPG i've ever played.
15412,"Fanstatic RPG, I have no idea how to explain it. A lot of weapons, characters, quests to enjoy in this RPG genre. Similar genre like Fallout, Skyrim & etc. I mean if you like those, you will definitely like this one as well."
15413,"Get quest, run, shoot, get thing, finish quest, repeat.

It was a great game when it came out, but now we know that you're not supposed to be a quest taxi."
15414,"Great game to play with friends. Don't go it alone, you will miss out."
15415,"Run and Gun, Hide and Run! When you think its to easy this game throws you a suprise that kicks your ass and makes you think ""OH SNAP I NEEDZ STRATERRRGY"" The dialog is damned funny - On sale for 3$? 
This is Borderlands! COME GET YOU ONE!"
15416,A hell of a lot of fun with friends.  This game has a good sense of humor and high replay value due to the random loot and multiple character types.
15417,"A Damn epic Mix of RPG, FPS and a true open World where you can do anything. (Open World is like that of Elder Scrolls and Fallout). P.S. has a damn good story as well."
15418,Borderline CRAAAAAZY
15419,zajebista gierka.. mp poprostu super.. gra ma tez smieszne chwile i takie wkurzajace.. ale plusem jest ze jak stracimy HP to padamy na kolana.. i jak uda nam sie w tej pozycji kogos zabic to wstajemy a jezeli nie to troacimy troche kasy i cofamy sie na spawn
15420,BUY IT DONT BE A FAG
15421,"It's a great game. Finished it two times on PS3. PC version seems like a pretty good port, even thoug some things like UI was clearly ment to work better on a console with a controller. I recommend installing a small application called Borderlands Advanced Settings before you play it."
15422,Very fun game with a large open world to explore. 4 Upgradable characters and skills and tons of unique weapons. Lots of missions and quests to keep you busy.
15423,"Great game, shines especially in co-op mode. If you don't have it yet you're missing out. Can't wait for Borderlands 2."
15424,"A MUST HAVE RPG FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER'S GAME!! REAL EPIC, GORE, BOSSES, CRAZY STUFF!!"
15425,Stupidly addictive! ... And I mean that in the most complimentary way possible.
15426,"Really great game, GOTY edition for £4.99 you'd be a fool to miss it, I'v bought GOTY twice now since i wanted it on steam retail version is a real hassle to download all the DLC and you have limited downloads."
15427,A fun shooter with some rather amusing characters.
15428,"This game is awesome for anyone who likes FPS and RPG type games.. Basically a first person shooter with 4 distinct classes, where you get to level up and upgrade your skills and weapons.. and with an awesome story and music.. Great replayability and comes with 4 expansion packs! Awesome deal :D ($7.50 on sale right now!) You can play by yourself or with friends with the same character, so get it so we can play it! :P"
15429,GET IT!
15430,IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS
15431,Basically WoW.. Now with guns!
15432,good game for co-op :)
15433,It's a freaking comic awesome gameplay :D - specially with freaking friends!
15434,Epic game!
15435,"Consigliatissimo,il miglior Role-Playing/Shooter su Steam
"
15436,"Borderlands is a genre defining game that took the concept of an RPG and finally put it in with FPS style gaming without taking from it. With online gaming and a fun style, this game takes you on a journey as you cross through hell and high water to find treasure and glory. If you have any sort of appreciation for a FPS or a RPG, you owe it to yourself to buy this game."
15437,"Pretty great game when played with 3 friends.  Solo, not so much.  The DLC packs are pretty fun too.  If you like FPS, and Action RPGs, then this is a great hybrid game for you!"
15438,"If you've never played it, play it. If you've played it, play it more."
15439,"one game that stole my soul for a good two months. I was hooked. so many differnt guns, an interesting story and with the 4 expansions gave me more stuff to do."
15440,"Love it, love it, love it."
15441,"This is a very fun game to play together with friends. I highly recommend choosing 3 other people and sticking with them throughout the adventure, as playing with strangers can be frustrating, a la Left 4 Dead & Left 4 Dead 2. Playing solo is pretty boring, and I recommend against playing with strangers, for they will likely do things that go counter to your personal interests, such as keeping all the loot for themselves.

If you can get a team of 4 friends together and schedule your games, you will have a great, great time with this game, if you like anything at all about FPS or RPG games. One thing of note, for example, is the immense variety of ways that enemies die screaming, which is very entertaining. The visuals are quite unique and of course the bajillions of guns provide an  endless upgrade path. All in all, lots of fun, 9/10."
15442,"An awesome game with many dlc's that gives you 3-4 times more playtime

Recommended to anyone that likes an RPG First Person Shooter Game !"
15443,Oooohhhh yeeeaahhh...... Just a funtime co-op shooter. Always good to kill mobs when killing time.
15444,ITS 8 DOLLA FOR EVERYTHING DURING SALES GET YOU SOME!!!!!!!
15445,If you are the type who likes rpg and fps shooting and funny actions and great animations this game is worth the pick up I highly recommending this game to those who likes to find rare tresures and lvling up a character or two and the weapons' are endless to find. Also the classes in the game are well balanced when working as a team.
15446,8.5 out of 10.....GREAT GAME - the DLC are great too!
15447,"Fun with friends, if you are on the same storyline.  Not so fun solo but who plays solo games anymore anyway?"
15448,"It took me a really long time to warm up to this game. It's lengthy, somewhat forgettable, even tedious at points. But I've really grown to love it now that I've stopped giving a damn about the story and fiddling with my never-large-enough backpack. Just play it. It becomes FUN really quickly if you stop caring about why you're playing and actually do it. The writing is by far the best part of this game - hysterical banter and one-liners abound. Insane quest objectives and just completely over-the-top action style gameplay. The game gets a hearty reccomendation. If you make it through the game, then do yourself a HUGE favor and by the DLC - which by far, in my opinion, trumps the game on its own. The only terribly negative thing about this game is how badly it suffers from consolitis. The controls are VERY poorly optimized for mouse and keyboard. If you have a gamepad, it's practically a must."
15449,Diablo 2 with guns and awesome!
15450,"One word to describe it all mothrakk!!!! google it :-]

When a boss is so big it makes the level look small, thats what epic is."
15451,"this makes me moist.
"
15452,"I couldn't figure out why, I just knew I couldn't stop playing this POS.  The plot has holes in it and ends too soon, the mission system has you backtrack through monotonous areas sometimes, enemies along the way don't give a fuck if they're -30 to you, their AI can get confused/stupid, you're forced in late levels to ditch your ride and hoof it too much, I've seen one orange drop in 50+ hrs, accuracy is apparently more rare than alien tech...the list goes on.  Then I realized it.  Gearbox at least understands the power of style and humor.  The story that's there just needs a few blanks filled in.  The combat system has flaws but good variety too and rewards for perserverance/skill...it really isn't all that bad.  While unrealized in places, the game's still got a lot of potential, and if they fix things in a sequel it's gonna be on.  Oh the other reason--according to pro review sites, I'm apparently easily fucking amused.  No biggie, I'm not amused by publisher bukkakefests at least."
15453,"There's really no excuse for you to not own Borderlands. Unless, of course, you dislike fun -- or crappy console UI in your PC game. A sub-par port from consoles, but the fun outshines the interface."
15454,very fun and a great game
15455,"It's an awesome game. Lots of good fun to be had. It's more than a bit like Diablo but with asplodey guns that go bang bang in first person and make the baddies heads pop! There's a good deal of originality and flavor to be had, though not the deepest main story. Bit rough around the edges too, but it's too much fun to get overly annoyed at that. The visual style is something you'll either enjoy or not, but it is great to not see gritty realism for once. Pro tip, probably best to stick either with multiplayer with friends or go single player on any one playthrough, as grouping while in different bits of the game was kind of (extremely) poorly implemented. 4/5"
15456,"I tried playing this through last year and didn't really get into it, but I gave it another go and actually really enjoyed it. The graphics are quite interesting and remind me a little of XIII from a few years back. The game play is a little repetitive here and there but it's not a deal breaker. I recommend this to anyone who likes shooters and a little comedy. I also recommend playing as the soldier/Roland cause I find his ability alot more useful and life saving then the others. 8/10"
15457,"Buy it while on say, be sure to buy GOTY, as it has the DLC's included for same price"
15458,"Excellent mix of Diablo and a FPS in a post-apocalyptic universe, I still recommend buying it today for those who never tried it yet."
15459,YES!
15460,"a very fun game.  archetypes are sniper, tank, caster and support.  loot gathering gives this game extreme replayability.  story is followable as long as one is willing to forgive inconsistent writing.  in truth with this one you can disregard the story entirely and just follow the waypoints.  dlc is best in the package deal because the one you want is Armory.  

i bought this game on disc as it came out.  then each dlc.  i bought the steam version just for the achievements! great game. Replay = Value for Money!

note - excessive leftover files bloat this install.  in this modified unreal engine the feature which does not render the part of the world we are not looking at, is disabled; thus the entire area we are in at any given time is constantly rendered.  this is quite taxing on most video cards so expect extra heat.

this review has been modified from its original form to allow for public viewing."
15461,very fun to play.   Diablo style skill points with different tiers. customize your guy the way you want him.   toooooooons of different weapons.  choose your style!      play this game.
15462,This game is awe-soooome. Get you one!
15463,Bought it on sale for $7.49. Great deal for the price.
15464,"BUY IT!  First person shooter, perfectly blended with RPG elements (skill tree) and tons of loot to pick up.  Perfect solo or co-op."
15465,"Probably one of my all-time favorite games. There's plenty of action, combat, humor, and general entertainment between the main game and its DLCs to keep you busy for a long time."
15466,One of the best! Always worth a shot ^^
15467,RPG + FPS = One of my favorite games of all time. Highly Recommended.
15468,"a shooter rpg- good graphics, nice gameplay, a lot of fun in  up to 4 player coop.  worth to buy for sure.  dr. ned and general knoxx dlcs are cool as well, the moxxys underdome and the claptrap dlc suck."
15469,Fun game that does not take itself too serious
15470,Git'chu one!
15471,This game makes me cry from its Awesomeness.
15472,"So addicting. A great game. If you don't get it, your missing out on all the fun you could be having. :)"
15473,"Great Game with long game play plus its just keeps getting better.
"
15474,"If you ever want a good rpg or fps to play, get this!"
15475,"So many guns, so little time...
Love how single player and co-op can be interweaved. The drop-in/drop-out ability is the best. Works fine on LAN and Online with multiple computers on the same internet connection. (unlike Black Ops, which kicks me if I try to join an online zombies match that my friend is in when we're both in the same room on the same internet connection...)
The DLC is worth it...I'll be playing this game for a long time."
15476,"RPG/FPS. If that tickles your interest, fucking buy this motherfucking balla triple OG gangturr legit shit game. Holy shit so many fucking guns. And the coop is a blast too. This game is deep, you know you want it."
15477,"Amazing RPG FPS. It has its problems, but has nevertheless provided me with endless fun."
15478,"A mix of Diablo and Fallout, fun to play with friends."
15479,cool game
15480,More than 160 hours later I still love this game.
15481,Quit thinking about it.  The game is dirt cheap.  Get the Game of the Year edition and have fun.  Shut up.  Just get it.  Get it.  Quit thinking about it and just get it.
15482,"It's like cyberpunk, first-person shooter Diablo, with inappropriate jokes and curse words!"
15483,"Fun action packed shooter, Even better with 4 player co-op!"
15484,more like I <3 HALO!
15485,"Borderlands is a hard game to put your finger on.
On one hand it is a great shooter with some awesome eploring and action.
On the other hand it is plagued by one of the worst co-op systems ever to have been created, right up there with windows live to be honest.
But no matter, the co-op is still insanely fun if you can get it to work and look past it flaws.
P.S. get the dlc packs since they actually make the game a bit more fun aswell as increase its longevity."
15486,"Oh my, just oh my.."
15487,"Super fun to play with friends, great visuals, neat setting/story, but a little too easy for my liking, and the 10 gazillion guns are kind of  unnecessary (but fun) 
Fun game but a little overrated and overhyped.

I can dance like Claptrap though."
15488,"just buy it, CHECK ME OUT IM DANCIN!"
15489,"If you like shooters and haven't played Borderlands, stop what you're doing and buy the GotY pack today. While the PC interface is clearly ripped from the console and, in that, painful, the actual mechanics are smooth and responsive. A unique art style combined with some of the wittiest incidental dialogue I've heard.. maybe ever. Borderlands is a joy to play from beginning to end. The Moxy pack is so-so but is included with GotY and the perks for beating parts of it are nice. The rest of the xpacs flow well with the core game experience. Played solo or with friends, this is some of the most fun a fan of story based shooters can have."
15490,"[i]EDIT: The text below was written before Steam Recommendations became Steam Reviews.[/i]

This great combination of a role-playing game and a first person shooter can provide entertainment for lots of hours. Funny dialogues will make you smile many times and diversified quests set on Pandora, a planet made of industrial garbage, will keep you interested until the very end. Borderlands is even better when completed with a friend in a co-op mode. Also, be sure to get the Zombie Island of Dr. Ned as it's the best DLC to this game."
15491,One of the most fun and entertaining FPS ever made.
15492,"Pew Pew multi player co-op with zombies, robots, midgets and phat lewtz. What's not to love!"
15493,"Fun and fast-paced shooter, with role-playing elements and designed for multiplayer. A treasure hunt on a strange planet, some of the craziest characters you'll ever meet, wierd weapons, ... oh, and claptraps! Explore many different locations, drive around in your own dune buggy (with complementary machine-gun or rocket launcher), and find the famed vault of Pandora!

All in all, I recommend this game to anyone who wants a change from the usual way-too-serious shooter fare."
15494,Great game that deserves a lot of co-op love!
15495,"I like it so you should to. Why mince high falluting words for you to read when you should be playing the game. Bottomline, if you like collecting all kind of loot that can tear new ones at a godly rate, look no further.

And if you need a vault hunting chum to seek them out, let me know..."
15496,fun fun fun fun
15497,"While not as good as the sequel, Borderlands 1 is quite fun to play with a group of funs. You don't need to play it to understand Borderlands 2 or the Pre-Sequel, but it helps at introducing you to this world. 

Also, it now runs on steamworks, so no more stupid ass gamespy."
15498,2 words : Epic.Game.
15499,"Holy crap is this fun with friends. Solo, not as much because the story's so thin."
15500,"As many have described it... It's Diablo II with guns. The plot is weak and the voice acting is ok (actually there are some very smartly written lines that made me laugh quite a bit), but the real draw is the gunplay. There are plenty of weapons to play with, and many that feel unique to the previous. It's a shame that the skills provided by each character, though fun and very useful, are not as plentiful as the guns. The skill tree does add some diversity between builds, but still, I would've liked to have seen more. If you have friends with it (like me...) then pick it up.

4.3/5"
15501,100+ hours and still counting.
15502,"I wasn't expecting to revel in the cartoonish landscape within BL. Between claptraps crying out in pain, bruisers foolishly standing within my SMG wake, and skags just asking for it as they rush me in a moment of epic Phasewalk witchery - this game has me mindlessly hooked."
15503,OMG ITS AN RPS
15504,Another failed attempt to marry FPS and RPG. Gazzillion of random loot guns but you may never see a decent version of what you need. You only get one active use ability per character which you can augment in different ways as you level up. Online nearly everyone has hacked guns that do 999k damage not to mention the lag if you manage to find a game. The most annoying thing by far is the damage mitigation by level. Meaning that me at lvl 22 will do 10% damage to any enemy 5+ levels higher than me. This just locks the player into grinding through enemies with extremely simple and unchallenging ai until you get to the final level where you just abuse a glitch to get unlimited leveled loot for the next (higher lvl) playthrough.
15505,"The story is as bland as a cardboard cutout, but that's a good thing.
For its meant to be shot at, just like everything else in the game.
Kill is the holy decree in this planet called Pandora, looting is optional.
Encounter wise sages in the form of claptraps, who dance and frollick amidst intense gunfights.
Nothing makes sense, nor should it either, on this strange planet.
Point and shoot, oops, and if it doesn't die I guess I should be talking to that NPC.
"
15506,Think fps meets MMO but there are no other morons playing to bother you.  Great game witha very fun co-op *should get it!*
15507,awesome game!!!
15508,"This game is okay I guess, for a 4 player FPS RPG I really couldn't get that into either the storyline or the looting, and character skill progression was alright but because its an FPS most of the bonuses were just numerical % bonuses so not very interesting.

Enemies are pretty boring to be honest, at least until you get to the VERY end of the game.  The story is 95% text boxes with no voice over and mostly skippable, but not very interesting because you have no dialogue options.  The last bosses were fun, but otherwise everything else failed to impress.

The DLC is better than the base game (so far) but really this game is not all that fun.  No real technical gripes aside from forced FOV and the rare bug or two, and the game runs very smoothly on a 2.8ghz dual core / GTS 250 / 4gb RAM machine with high settings."
15509,Amazing game.
15510,Fun with a group of friends! Wish my damn friends would play with me.
15511,"Fun mix of RPG elements and gunplay, really enjoyed this game!!!"
15512,"Davvero un ottimo gioco sotto tutti i punti di vista, e uno Humor non troppo velato che rende magnifica l'esperienza di gioco, sopratutto se in Coop.
Da provare assolutamente."
15513,Pew pew!
15514,"If you like shooters - _at all_ - you need to play this game.  Hell, I didn't think I liked shooters that much 'till I played it."
15515,"Best co-op game available today, period. Also home to the best DLC any game has ever recieved. DLC is amazing."
15516,SHOOT STUFF
15517,"Here is a game you should play, not matter who you are!"
15518,"U dont have to worry about guns,ammo or enemys cos there are gonna be millions of them. Cool game , but it s start to get boring after 20 hours but it s still very good game and it s better in co -op online."
15519,Incredibly addicting! Hilarious! Action-packed! FPS RPG!
15520,"Just buy the GOTY edition, get a boatload of content, and play with three friends."
15521,"Fantastic game, one of the best I have ever played."
15522,I logged some 400+ hours' playtime in about 1.5 months playing this game. You don't waste that kind of time on a bad game.
15523,"very good freeroaming game
"
15524,"If you like shooters and action rpg´s....don´t think...buy! This game is really worth the 30 bucks. There are thousands of guns and many, many awesome quests with lots of humor in them (especially the DLC´s). Btw: if you are playing online the fun multiplies by the players."
15525,"This is a great multiplayer and singleplayer experience. It's streamlined and straight forward. Imagine a multiplayer Stalker with a futuristic vaguely wild west atmosphere. There are four set modular classes. You can either choose to buff yourself or your teammates, or both. The creatures level a little slowly, especially if you boost your level really fast by taking every available quest. 

The ending is just abrupt and bizarre. 

The DLC includes a collection of high-level multiplayer missions. If you really want to test your character, these maps will do it. 
"
15526,Borderlands is an amazing example of FPS/RPG done right. Log on and score some critical headshots!
15527,Very few things equal the pleasure of running over scags in a pink dune buggy.
15528,Crazy Wapaons >> i loved ;)
15529,"Great art style and Idea but could have put my fps skills to better use, too easy and should have had team vs implemented."
15530,Awesome! I cant stop playing it!
15531,Fun coop shooter
15532,Fun game. Kind of like a FPS RPG with the random loot of Diablo. Highly recommend.
15533,"This game grew on me, so it took me a while to see what this game is... really good. It's a FPS but with RPG elements. This means your character will level up and get stronger, but it's still all about shooting. You can play alone or in coop. The cartoony style of the game is simply fantastic!"
15534,"I did not play this game very much because it reminds me too much of my real life, except in the game I am allowed to have weapons. After I died a slow, lonely death in the desolate land I turned it off. I did not want to experience that more than I will have to. It is probably a good purchase if you are not in similar circumstances to me."
15535,I fired every bullet ever.
15536,Great mix of rpg and fps elements
15537,"This game is very original. You can play the storyline alone or with up to 3 friends! All of the textures in this game are hand-made and give it a very original look! The 4 DLC's give the game even more spice! Giving it extra time to play! You can always make a new character and start all over with another character. The AI is quite intelligent aswell and they will try to flank you or step away from your line of fire making it a challenging game. If you have the money and you like first person role playing games, but you also like fps-shooters. This is definitly a game for you!"
15538,This is a great game
15539,Es un juego realmente bueno
15540,Excellent game if its on sale. It has a fun and strange story but can be confusing at times. It has a decent amount of replay value but this is not a real MMO.
15541,"Truly fantastic multiplayer blast. It's a lot of fun single player too, but really shines playing it with buddies.
The game itself is absolutely superb. Sound, graphics, action everything combines brilliantly to create an almost perfect FPS RPG. The only negative points are the MP lobby system and that's it's an obvious console port.
9/10"
15542,"So much stuff to do, so little time"
15543,"

"
15544,Strangely appealing bad game. Shoot enemies with bad AI over and over again as your numbers get bigger and treasure bursts from their corpses with bigger numbers than the treasure you're currently using. Keep playing forever.
15545,"Easily one of, if not the, best shooters I've played. More guns than god, more varied types of guns than god, alien guns, Jackobs guns, etc. Extremely amusing with intertwining storylines which, along with the characters invovled, are bloody hilarious. Plus, there's the added bonus of saw-blade axe and shotgun-weilding midgets (among everything else) that explode in cartoonish gore when run over with vehicals."
15546,Great 1st person shooter with RPG elements.  General Knoxx DLC is pretty fun too.
15547,this is a 1st person shooter that plays like a RPG.
15548,More fuel for my love of class based FPS's.
15549,Awesome game to play with friends :D
15550,"Buy it, play it, love it"
15551,Fun game at a good price on steam sale.
15552,Borderland ROXX
15553,"85/100 SP / Co-Op RPG / FPS. Overall, this game is worth buying, especially the General Knoxx and Claptrap dlc's. Gameplay wise, although it starts out slow, the pacing soon quickens and you'll find yourself losing track of time. The more levels & abilities you gain and the more areas you explore as you loot better and better weapons, the more fun it becomes. 

Cons: When I first played the game, I was initially disappointed that the AI would respawn every 10 minutes or so. It just felt like I wasn't making much of a difference in the game world in regards to helping the law abiding citizens of Pandora. I also was disappointed by the lack of variety of AI to fight against as well as the lack of variety in regards to the terrain. One should note though, that the variety does get a lot better towards the end of the game. Finally, you may wish to visit the Borderlands wiki for a few PC tweaks that make the game a lot more PC friendly and enjoyable."
15554,It's the best parts of any loot-centric rpg like WoW/Diablo plus guns plus a great art style and a unique stellar looking environment. I love this thing to death. Too bad the PC release is a tad buggy.
15555,"An incredibly fun game: if you have bros to play it with. While it can be played solo, doing so just feels like any other FPS - though with admittedly more questing and sandboxing. But with friends (up to 3 with you) it becomes an entirely new experience.

It's like playing Diablo II with guns. Quests, loot with varying rarity and lots of stats, and lots of enemies to kill. If there's a game worth getting a 4-pack for, this is the one."
15556,"A great BYOF(Bring Your Own Friends) game, I really enjoyed this game.
Between the humor and the diablo 2 style costomization it was all around a solid FPS:RPG"
15557,DAMN! It's AWESOME!!!
15558,Awsome story line and randomly generated wepons makes this one of my favorits
15559,"Borderlands is probably the best FPS/RPG hybrid I've ever played. If you enjoy either, I think you'll like this game."
15560,"Если вы хотите играть в РПГ и шутер с бешенными перестрелками - покупайте эту игру . Вы не прогадаете . Временами вам будет казаться , что у Вас "" сносит крышу "" от музыки и визга убиваемых противников . Это действительно классная игра ! Вы просто не сможете остановиться выполняя одно задание за другим . Играть в Borderlands всегда интересно ."
15561,this is prolly my favorite game right now
15562,"""Borderlands""
You play this game in 1st person, but its truelly an RPG and feels that way. Play as one of the four classes available, Really recommended to play co-op with your friends.
Visually this game looks really artistic with all the hand painted textures, the enemies all fit right in and overal it kinda feels like a comic book (in a GOOD way).
Cause of the random weapon generation system litterally thousands type of guns can drop.
The quest require you to do all kinds of stuff for lazy ass questgivers like any RPG.
Fun enemies, fun quests, great graphics, awesome world.
Must have if you enjoy co-op RPG's"
15563,Like sorting through endless piles of garbage? Then this is the game for you! The premier FPS trash sorting simulation.
15564,Best gun-based co-op loot game ever.
15565,"A damn fun game all the way through, but the ending is so disappointing. It would probably be a lot more fun with friends, but since you all have to play at the same time and if anyone starts playing without the others, they'll quickly become overpowered in comparison to the rest of the team due to how quickly you advance in this game. I'm glad I bought it, though, and I recommend you guys try it too, I played the game solo and still enjoyed it the entire time, get it, but don't expect it to be exactly like all the claims they make about this game, they're over exaggerated."
15566,"This is a great game and I stole this for $7.80 on sale. The game is put together very well and it has great gameplay and unique graphics. This game reminds me of Fallout but it is different in many ways. You can do 4-player coop mode in this game and it makes it more fun. The weapon selection is cool, fantasic, and innovative. This game I think is step's above Fallout and more difficult. Replay value should be high.  A must buy in my opinion. 8.5/10"
15567,lol finished ths  one  on xbox  was ok
15568,My favourite FPS. definitely worth playing. High replayability and very fun.
15569,"Awesome mix of FPS and RPG.  Hours of fun - but play with a friend or more, or it will become boring fast."
15570,Very nice game! =]
15571,"Borderlands has swiftly become one of my favorite games. I never had anticipated enjoying it as much as I do, and still have not  grown bored with its style or gameplay. It has tremendous replay value, and considerable DLC for those who truly fall in love. The multiplayer is well done, and although the difficulty is laughable at times, there are still well placed challenges throughout the game. The pacing is well done, and I personally love the humor and storyline, even though it is remarkably predictable."
15572,The single player is not bad but playign this game in co-op really maks it shine. The cell shading is doen well and nothing beats a good FPS.
15573,Weapons compiling system is awesome.
15574,The best way to shoot a guy in the head is with a gun!
15575,"bom demais , recomendadissimo"
15576,"This game is gorgeous, hilarious, engaging and loads of fun. Play it you must."
15577,Catch a riiiiide!
15578,Awesome blend of RPG and shooter elements for casual to moderate gameplay.
15579,"You emerge in the stylised landscape of Pandora, a barren wasteland filled with excitement and hostile alien creatures. Whilst all this would amount to a pretty good game already, Borderlands ups the ante with it's Diablo-like gameplay. All pickups and drops are randomised, including the guns you get. Because of the almost limitless amount of weapons, class builds and strategies that follow. Borderlands still remains replayable just throughout singleplayer.

Multiplayer however is pretty lackluster, especially if your playing with random players. It comes highly recommended to play multiplayer with a few friends rather then just game surfing."
15580,You get to shoot midgets.
15581,Good game
15582,OH YEAH WELL HEH!
15583,ce jeu est une tuerie
15584,fun for all video cards
15585,"A great mix of the best elements from the first person shooter and the RPG genres. Very entertaining coop experience. With a few post-installation tweaks that you can find instructions for online, Borderlands is just a straight-up good time."
15586,"Yeah, this game is okay... I guess."
15587,Fun game. A nice hybrid of FPS with rpg elements. I really like the sense of humor.
15588,"The best game where random loot drops off badguys in glorious first person rpg fashion. It's really a good game if you like pressing the E key a lot and selling the worthless junk you pick up. It's really really good if you're a sucker for random drops and hoarding.

The ending is bogus as hell.

But the DLC is designed to give a person ulcers. No fast travel, inane quest pathing designed to make you backtrack too goddamn much. It's sapping my soul."
15589,"Buy it, great co-op online, good DLC, nice replay value. Worth it."
15590,"I really recommend this game to you all FPS fans, the graphic looks cool, it has a bit of cartoony effect but it's actually a great 3D rendering, you can lvl up your characters and each of the characters have their-own skills trees, many loots from enemies and surroundings, many cool weapons *it has so many shapes and colours, well FPS gore and fun fantasy theme with a magnificent gameplay and map-designs, this is definitely a worth buying game, single player is really challenging and fun! if we play co-op (4players) it will be four times the fun! my rating: 8/10 JOIN ME NOW!"
15591,"Diablo meets fallout. If you like collecting loot and shooting everything that moves, this is pretty good."
15592,"Borderlands is quite the gem.  Gearbox and 2K have put out good shooters and crap shooters.  This is one of the former.  It is a class based FPS that has leveling, skill trees, Diablo-esque loot drops, and multiplayer.  Oddly enough, I feel that it pulls all of those off.  My first playthrough was with three friends and we all played different roles.  It was a very refreshing experience.  It's a game that rewards player skills but allows you to play so many different ways.  All in all, a damned good value."
15593,"Do you like Diablo 2, do you like a great old school shooter like Unreal or Quake? Well this is what happens when these two sexy parents hook up one night over tequila! Borderlands is a wild ride of a game that never takes it self seriously, aside from the main quest lines and hundreds of side quests is a random item system that will have you farming bosses for hours seeking that one upgrade, this game has it all if you want a solid single player experiance this will satisfy. But if you love some multiplayer co-op this game simply is wonderful. Co-op shines as while you stand together fighting a common enemy the dropping of a rare weapon should see even the most stalward of friends scrambling to be first to obtain the treasure. Well done Gearbox you have made the diablo 2 of first person shooters and hell it works!

Get this game now!

9 / 10"
15594,"If you have any friends at all, even those crazy ones who can't stop telling stories you need to play this game with them. Its Diablo + Fallout with a little bit of Giants:Citizen Kabuto. A Must Have for anyone with friends. If you dont have friends, you shouldnt have this game. You're wasting its potential."
15595,"This. Borderlands is an amazing game.

The graphics are brilliant, I struggle to think of one section where it didn't look nice. Obviously it needs leeway with textures because of the open world environment, but even then it looks amazing. The gameplay is a riot, partly because you can do it alone or with friends, and the difficulty is adjusted based on the number of players. The enemies never get repetitive because there are so many different areas to travel through, and the constant change of scene is always a welcoming sight for the eyes.

It's not without negatives however. The plot is predictable right from the start, and you don't particularly engage with any of the characters to any great level, so I didn't get sucked in for the story whatsoever. Nonetheless, absolutely fantastic.

8/10."
15596,Marha jó coop játék
15597,Colors of the RPG life! Get it.
15598,"Ahhh Borderlands ""FPS and RPG made a baby"" SOOOO much fun!"
15599,hi you should definitely get this game
15600,A+ game. If you don't have it already - buy it and see what you're missing!
15601,"Okay,  I didn't think much of this game before I bought it because the ads and reviews really pointed to it being a FPS killfest with a fun co-op component.  Being an  anti-social single-player most of the time (due to work & time constraints) I passed on this title until a big sale.  Honestly, a shooter has rarely been so fun.  It's a balance between an open world shooter & a RPG with weight given to the shooter.  Storyline is just cohesive enough to keep going and I really like the two songs in the opening and ending.  It satisfies the shooter in me when I need a quick fix."
15602,OMG GUNS AND BLOWING UP STUFF!!!!!
15603,"One of the best co-op games ever made, period. Non-stop awesomeness."
15604,Definitely the most fun I've had in an RPGish FPS since Freelancer.
15605,I was very surprised just how well this games fits together. Probably the bargin buy of the Summer Cap savings!
15606,Tis' good!
15607,BEST GAME DOUBLEALYA EVER BOUGHT ME. THANKS G!
15608,"Play this game from start to finish with 3 other friends, each one with a different character, with all the the DLCs that get better as you go, and you're in for ALOT of fun.
Or you can just duplicate yourself a super modded weapon or shield XD"
15609,"best game ever, even better than Diablo 2."
15610,"this game is your normal every day shooter to the point when you level up . then you get shields , then the other RPG aspects come in on later levels. The main story is fun and interesting. The DLC's make it even better. from surviving a Zombie Apocolypse from Dr. Ned to surviving and eventually taking down the INAC . the most hardest thing about this game is figuring out which character to choose first ... for me it was the Beserker :3"
15611,"I love the story, and the graphics are unique. Once you get used to them, they're pretty awesome."
15612,Borderlands is a game truly worth having in any collection!
15613,Borderlands is a first person shooter that caters to all shooter and RPG players. The game have four playable characters and each characters have their own specialty. These characters unique abilities allow the player to play the game in many different ways and therefore a lot of replay values.  NOTE: This game was tough when i was playing it on the 360 because of my shooting skills. This game required good skills or it will get really tough very fast.
15614,Dis Game.... so much fun. Its like playing Diablo but with guns!
15615,It's a real good gun.
15616,"A bit Fallout'esque, with a lot of fun limb/torso-removing action. 10/10"
15617,Do you like RPG Shooters? Then missing this game would be a crime. Tons of loot and hilarious quotes make this game a blast to play with your friends.
15618,"In 2009 it was a borderline (sorry) jolly game, with near-infinite potential marred by the developers staying far inside the borders (sorry) of how far they could have taken the weapon randomisation, incl PR lies. Usually one blames that on it being a console game, not a PC-only game. But what really makes this GOTY release stand out is that it uses the most horrible activation mechanism mankind has yet conceived. Not a launcher or the main menu or the installer asks you for the key, no, you get to enter DLC keys into some SECUAIDS program that actually starts during the loading screen. For me it did not manage to get focus at first, so I just saw the loading screen load and load and load.. and finally I bothered to look at my case and saw that there was no activity whatsoever being indicated by the LEDs. With a lot of creative alt-tab smashing, I was eventually confronted with an activation program on top of my Borderlands game which I could only control via keyboard ((continued:))"
15619,"Best FPS rotoscope-style animation futuristic game i've ever played, and that's saying a lot. I'm on playthrough #2, level 54, and it's still challenging and fun. The 17,750,000 types of guns that can drop gives this game heaps of replayability. Top that off with multiplayer and co-op modes which scale to team size, share cash drops and loot properly and so forth, and this is a no-brainer. Runs like butter on my 3 yr old PC. Those that want 120+ hrs of gameplay, will want to snag the GOTY edition which includes the four DLCs."
15620,Awesomesause.
15621,"Borderlands is a solid shooter with unique environments and enemies, but it is considerably more fun with friends. It also has GREAT replay value considering the weapon/item drop and purchase systems."
15622,"One of the best RPG Games I have ever played!  Anyone who likes RPG will love this!  
Also a brilliant idea for 4 player RPG!"
15623,SWEET FUCKING GAME.
15624,"I recommend Borderlands, the game has a way of blowing a load into your brain."
15625,very fun game
15626,You buy! you buy now!
15627,"A good game for it's time. 

The PC port was a bit shabby, but manage-able. (No FOV slider and counter intuitive clunky UI) BUT PLAYABLE.

It wasn't enough to ruin the overall experience. It's a lovely RPG\FPS that takes place in Pandora, a very interesting and stylized world.

the characters are interesting and the quests and maps are memorable. It's a good experience to have and it's even better with 3 other friends in co-op multiplayer.

What makes it unique it's the guns system. There are millions and millions of guns and it's very unlikely to find the same gun twice... ever. They are all randomized and quite unique.

That being said the game relies a bit too much on bullet sponges, that makes the experience a bit boring and frustrating every now and then.

But even with that I still recommend this game. It's stylized, it's fun and it's AWESOME.

Go shoot some bandits!"
15628,"Quirky game. Feels like Fallout but is on an alien planet. Diabloesque weapon and skill system. If Hellgate: London was done right, it would be Borderlands."
15629,"An over the top shooter with coop, levels, skills, and tons of loot.    Buy it now."
15630,This shit is legit
15631,This game is great!
15632,Fun with friends!
15633,"This post-apocalyptic lootfest is a solid mix of  RPG mechanics (level up, get the loot) and FPS action. There are a multitude of quests and baddies to shoot, but the overall plot is quite forgettable. I don't really recommend that you play this game alone, since it was obviously designed with co-op in mind. I played with my girlfriend and we had a really good time, but when playing by myself, it wasn't nearly as interesting or compelling. The loot system is robust, if not a bit derivitive of the hack and slash genre ala diablo. You will find tons and tons of weapons and upgrades with random enhancements on them, and a lot of the guns feel very different from one another despite being the same base type. You'll feel like an upgrade is an actual upgrade most of the time, and that's pretty awesome. Try it out, but bring a friend. Trust me."
15634,"Clever, casual, psychotic shoot em up / RPG with a disgusting number of weapons."
15635,"Brilliant game, cannot recommend it enough."
15636,"Mix a FPS of MadMax with a mission based RPG. Very good, funny, lot of action and blood. I could be repetitive sometimes, but it worth buying."
15637,Awesome RPG game!
15638,dou ok ho play ge
15639,"Simply awesome!
An RPG shooter with immersive gameplay and a great sense of humour!
If you haven't played Borderlands yet, you really should give it a try!"
15640,"This game is extremely fun actually I usually get bored of FPS but this one keeps it interesting with RPG elements, quests and looting for bigger better guns."
15641,"I've played and completed this game already on the XBox360.  I'm not a big fan of FPS games, but I always enjoy playing this one.  (Which is why I bought it again for PC.)  It's a lot of fun, even better going through it co-op with friends.  Love the RPG aspects tacked onto it as well and random loot is always nice.  It sort of adds a little Diablo thing to it with both of those.  But it's an FPS!!  How in da hell?!"
15642,Unique FPS co-op gameplay which nobody has yet to better. A must have to your arsenal of games.
15643,"Fallout, Mercenaries and FarCry2 all-in-one."
15644,"I had a blast with this.  Kinda of a cross between an MMO and a FPS.  So many different guns to get.... 1000's if you will.  Co-op, arenas, Boss fights, story line and witty dialog with a bunch of DLC.  GREAT GAME!"
15645,"Choose your class, level up, upgrade skills, collect money, buy weapons and equipments in open world FPS game... This game is really fun to play with friends, you can do the whole storyline together, help each other out, and most importantly do lots 'n lots of quests! As long as you have friends to play with, you can play this game for hours over hours without getting bored. This game also has a nice sense of humor and I find it fun, funny and incredibly unique."
15646,Very fun FPS/RPG. Also he has 3 balls.
15647,its geed
15648,"Way better than I thought, 30 hours and counting."
15649,Happiness is a shotgun and angry midgets.
15650,Great game if you ignore the weird ending.
15651,"Fun game, long SP, and even better with coop!"
15652,One of the best games EVER! Try it now!
15653,"This game is hilarious, especially coop mode."
15654,"Lots of guns, decidedly offbeat sense of humor, effective character customization, and plenty of WTF moments that simply can't be explained any other way. An entirely worthwhile bullet-fest, single or multi player."
15655,Awesome - why have I not played this before???
15656,It's the bomb Tom.
15657,"STRIP THE FLESH, SALT THE WOUND HAHAHAHAHAH!"
15658,Great game to co-op on!
15659,Fallout on crack. Brilliant fun ! The game really seperates itself from other FPS games as the Half Life franchise did. Great references to culture such as movies and other video games. I recommend getting game of the year edition as all the DLC is included. Bring on Borderlands 2! Heyoo!
15660,"Diablo with guns, guns, and more guns! If you like guns, and you liked Diablo II, this is the game for you!

Personally, Diablo was to limiting in the signifigant builds availible.  However, in Borderlands, you can easily change how your character works to fit the situation or team build.

The internet fandom has worn off a bit, but it's still one of my favorites to play with buddies on a LAN."
15661,This game is so awesome its like WOW meets Half life :)
15662,Very good game. I played through it 3 times. DLC's make it even better. Recommended!
15663,"A Great Game to  play at your own pace, Even   better if you have all the dlc""s."
15664,It's barely worth playing really. But it's still alright as a multiplayer campaign. I wouldn't want to play it alone.
15665,A mile wide. An inch deep. A total fucking blast.
15666,"Very well done RPG.  The nice thing with this game is that the majority focus is on combat, and not communicating with NPCs.  The most you get is getting quests on a   message board.  It focuses on quest, and upgrading your charater.  It is so easy to customize the character to your play style, and it does a good job of getting yotu through the story!  There are infinate weapons, and cool use of vehicles.  Lots of action, and simplifies the RPG experience.  Great humor, and such a cool stylized look!  My favorite part is no saves are required.  You just have save points that you restore too.  If you die it has a great feature of a last chance.  If you can kill something before the time runs out you are back in the game.  The co-op feature is also good because you play the game, but can have three other players helping!

Worth getting, and tons of fun!  The DLC content is also very good.  I played the DLC content for longer time than the actual game!"
15667,fun game takes a good amount of time to complete fully though but a very good game especially with the dlc
15668,"I remember dropping a quick review on trhis game to get an achevement during a past steam sale. Now I want to come back and put a few real comments in. I loved playuing this game when it came out. The art style was a something to behold and it really helps set the stage for the unique adventures that are in store. 

SO much content I dont know really where to begin. Ive enjoyed every minute it took to get to the end and after playing Borderlands 2 I went back  to try again and it was still a blast. 

So much bang for your buck that you feel like a midget with a shotgun. (bowled over)"
15669,I like this game.
15670,love it! <3
15671,good coop single player is okay
15672,Borderlands is toll
15673,"I believe Borderlands to be much like the soft doughy center in cookies. 
It's just.. the best bits. It's hard, it's got RPG elements, FPS elements, amazing graphics, a sprinkling of randomly-generated items and heart-stoppingly-smart AI moments.

As described in other reviews, Borderlands is fun in Single Player, but why have the soup when you can have the cake. Online brings another dimension to the game - sharing, competing, blowing each other up and reviving each other. It's not on the Magicka level of madness, sure - but nothing is on that level.

It's essentially an FPS at heart, but more inclined to the RPG side of gamers - which works very well.
It's every bit as comically disturbing as the logo would have you believe - it's serious when it has to be, but every other time you're just hiding behind a friend with no ammo for cover.

A well defined game, turning all the cogs."
15674,"Fun game, less RPG style than Fallout 3/New Vegas but still none the less good all round games, the Hunter seems to be the odd one out of the classes and maybe the hardest to play."
15675,"Ignore the showy picture, this is a really good action RPG combined with an FPS. And there are no elves, dwarves or dragons :)"
15676,"One of the best co-op games I have played, seriously good fun."
15677,"GOTY edition is better, but the game in general is totally awesome!!!"
15678,DUS GAEM IZ DA BOMZ
15679,Great game to play with friends who're tired of the traditional MMO.
15680,"I cannot recommend this game enough. All the FPS fun without the immediate death you come to expect from such a genre. The RPG factor allows for both randomized loot and improvements on skills, giving you an edge. Save a couple of bucks and get the GotY edition, as the DLC is more than worth it."
15681,"THIS GAME WILL BLOW YOUR MIND. LOTS OF GUNS!. MORE GUNS THAN YOU EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE! LOTS OF SKRAGS! SHOOT THE SKRAGS WITH THE GUNS! OR RUN THEM OVER, THAT IS FUN TOO!"
15682,"Great RPG-Shooter.
Interesting graphical style.
AMAZING in multi-player (co-op)."
15683,"Love this game. Great value now that it's of an age. I'm not typically a big shooter fan, but the RPG/questing elements of this game made it work for me."
15684,It's first-person Diablo with guns and a sense of humor.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.
15685,"Esse jogo é bom demais, eu recomendo a todos!!! :D"
15686,one of the best games now available!
15687,"You get to blast midgets in the face with shotguns, how can this get any better?"
15688,LOVE LOVE LOVE this game. DEMANDS co-op play with a recommended party of 3+.  Such a blast though. If you like shooters and medium/light RPG elements this is a kick-ass game.
15689,Blinding game. Absolutely awesome.
15690,"It's a lot of fun, the art style is great, and it has some of the best writing I've ever seen in a game."
15691,FUN GAME I LIKE IT ALL DAY
15692,bunu alıyorsunuz. bana haber çakıyorsunuz doprudan co-op hack'n slash yabıyoruz. eşsiz lezzet !!!

15696,"Doing this for a steam ticket
"
15697,At first I thought it was just another FPS but the storyline and funny dialog pulled me in and I was hooked!
15698,"A quirky shooter, unlike most you'll play. Fun RPG shooter with lots of different options, and fun variations in how you play the game.

Turn off that dang ""auto-aim"", though. Should be labeled ""How not to get headshots"" while playing on the PC."
15699,"Defs a buy. The BroMoSai recommends it
"
15700,If you ain't Brick you ain't shit.
15701,Got really addicted to this one.  Lost track of how many playthroughs and characters I've had.
15702,"It's Diablo with guns but not nearly as well designed.  It's like heroin that doesn't get you high, but still gets you addicted."

15707,Pretty cool game. Very well done strange mashup of an FPS and an RPG. The DLCs were actually worth it. I kinda wish the replayability and difficulty was a bit more open ended though.
15708,borederlands isn't bored er lands
15709,"Fun with friends, great for messing around."
15710,"Awesome Game, addictive and fun when playing with friends."
15711,Excellent replay value.
15712,I just love this game
15713,"dont sleep, buy it"
15714,"Diablo meets Doom. Classic RPG item collection in an FPS perspective. AMAZING game, particularly co-op. I recommend one solo play-through just to really see the story unfold through the quests, since in multiplayer someone else turning in a quest turns it in for you as well and you'll miss content, and I find the storyline and characters interesting enough to pay attention to at least once. But where this game really shines is in co-op with 2-4 people; the enemies scale up in power to match the player count and it's a blast taking out hundreds of enemies and collecting scores of guns; just make sure everyone specializes in a different weapon type or two, so you don't fight over that amazing new sniper rifle."
15715,BoredarLanDz is leik totooly a coul storie book.! It haz aliens n guns n gunz and moror gunz butt expecially teh aleins! FUn for teh whole famuly butt wach owt FoR LiLIth cuz ppl wont's stops lookin g at mai BEWBS!!!
15716,Great fun solo. Jump into a team with your friends or randoms and reak havoc on Pandora.
15717,"This game is good for both FPS and RPG fans. It might not have a HUGE story like most RPGs, but it has a lot of elements and even some strategy to it. There is a lot to do in this game. And teaming up with friends doesn't make the game too easy, because it actually ups the difficulty of enemies. A must have for any Steam user."
15718,"This is an odd game. The shading effect takes a while to get used to and like normal rgps there is a lot of running back and forth. However the gun fights are often intense, you can prat about do what you want or just enjoy the strangely appealing humour. the dlc although appearing small isn't. Each adds a new experience and 3-5+ hours if you do it right"
15719,"Simple stylised ridiculous fun. 
If you are looking for plot, if you are looking for realism or wit, keep walking. BUT if you are looking for simple shooty fun with a couple of friends,  then look no further.
Borderlands is uncomplicated, You shoot guys for money, you use the money to guy bigger guns and shoot bigger guys.
Played on its own, borderlands is slightly above average as shooters go, however its strength is its 4 player cooperative game play.
Played with a few buddies the grind transmutes to hilarity as you bull charge the bad guys and eventually get run over in the middle of vehicle based levels.
Jump in, arm up and get ready to make it rain bullets."
15720,If u haven't just try it! :)
15721,Great game lots of jokes and the gameplay is great you'll want to play this game nonstop
15722,Play it!
15723,"Weapons, Weapons, Weapons. If you like guns, guns that shoot fire and lightning, guns that blow the fuck out of people (and that was just the pistol) Or rockets that shoot five missles at once..... then five minutes later you find an even better laser blaster and think why did I want the five shooting rocket launcher when I've found a lightning and fire rocket lanucher. This game blows my mind which the amound of stuff. Oh yeah and it's a fun game. Best played with good friends. :)"
15724,It's like Fallout 3 meets a comic book :) MMM!
15725,Another great game. Similar to Fallout with the whole FPS RPG type thing. 5/5 stars!
15726,THIS SHITS GOOD
15727,"the storyline wasnt exactly the best out there, and after awhile, its repetitive nature will slowly become more appearent and bothersome to you.

But that doesnt mean that it ain't worth a good number of hours. the core gameplay is good."
15728,Z awesome
15729,Fun game.
15730,Fun as all hell when your play with the right people and the right way.
15731,FUN
15732,
15733,Great fun !
15734,It's easy to lose friends over this game.
15735,this game is a gr8 co-op game to play with a group of 4 players
15736,"This is the game I spent most of my time on. Its really fun and kinda addictive, multi-player co-op is way better than single player. With all the missions and DLC packs you wont run out of things to do."
15737,"I don't know in what hole I lived without hearing of this game, but with four good friends and some spare time this game is an awesome shooter with lots of laughs."
15738,"Awesome FPS RPG.....worth buying. And play on Multiplayer, much more fun!"
15739,Nice game!
15740,"Una vez pasado el nivel 6 y en modo cooperativo resulta realmente entretenido, aunque quizás al principio sea algo lento, te puedes pasar un buen rato."
15741,Most fun you can have in FPS-RPG game :)
15742,Up for some BO-DER-LANDS? I sure am!
15743,"Now THIS is how you make a good Co-op Game!! All the fun and excitement of grouping and working together in an MMO with none of the social ridiculousness. You have your friends, people you already know. Just load up and head out. It's like what would happen if all of a sudden Fallout 3 had a co-op multiplayer option. Fun, challenging missions, good character progession, an extensive arsenal of interesting and highly useful weaponry, and a world full of wack-nut NPCs you can't help but laugh at, and really solid FPS adventure gameplay. GO GET IT!!

Another tasty tidbit: Borderlands is BEAUTIFUL!! It's colorful and detailed, and really creepy in some spots. It has exellent performance, even at 1080p with most of the bells and whistles turned on, even with just a low end 4-core AM3 proc and a GeForce 9600 GT."
15744,"Borderlands is one of my top 5 favorite games ever to exist. If you love first person shooters and love role playing games, you would fall in love with  this game like i did.  there is also Co-op and LoVely BiG GuuuuuuunZ! I recommend the Game of The Year edition of this game too because it adds all the dlc's into one package and with the game itself. Trust me, you will love this game :D"
15745,"Great RPG elements, unusual but striking visual style, and tons of bad guys and loot.  Just a blast all the way around."
15746,total awesomeness
15747,"Take Diablo 2's loot system, TF2's Humor, and Unreal Tournament's weapons, throw them in a blender, and what do you get?

A broken blender! That and Borderlands!"
15748,This be very gud gaem if you laik phat lewts!
15749,An awesome game. More fun online :)
15750,80年代アメリカンカルチャーパロディーが思った以上に入っているので､そう言うネタ大好きな人は凄くオススメ｡
15751,"Borderlands is a must have should you find the GOTY edition on sale from Steam, which, it recently was. Fantastic game. Loads of missions available in which you fight nasties, earn experience points, achieve objectives and level up your carachter. I have played all four carachters and must say it has been fun every time. Loads of weapons, shields and class mods to choose from, which ultimately turns your carachter into a killing machine.

This is a great game for Co-op with four friends. DLC packs are packed full of missions, new maps, vehicles, enemies and weapons which provide days of fun, literally.

Totally recommend it to anyone looking for a bit of co-op fun that lasts longer than a few hours."
15752,AWSOME!
15753,"If you love games where you kill someone in so many ways your head hurts. Get it!
I prefer driving around and running over whatever gets in my way lol :)"
15754,"Played through this once on a friend's 360, then picked it up on Steam for $7.50 - money well spent. Even having played through once, I find that Borderlands is extremely fun and worth it, even at the normal $20 (or $30 for GOTY) - and I haven't even gotten to the DLC content yet. Fun enough alone, this game is 10x better when played with at least one other person, so be prepared and bring a friend!"
15755,"its a crazy game but you have a lot of fun with it especially with friends.
So much things do to and so many different weapons to find.
The humour throughout the game adds perfectly to the comicstyle of the whole world"
15756,Epic Music
15757,"I reccomend this game, it is awesome!"
15758,Awesome game. Worth at least one play though. I could totally go 48 hours without sleep and keep playing this game...
15759,fun nuff said
15760,"I love this game, Let's play and level up and grab all the acheivements."
15761,Stupid fun over the top coop game. Best way to describe it would be Left 4 Dead crossed with fallout 3.
15762,Probably 2010's best game. A true masterpiece.
15763,Really surprised me how fun this game is. Prepare to use tens of hours on it if you buy it :)
15764,Three thumbs up...
15765,"Shoot things, level up, get new guns, repeat. Lots of fun with friends!"
15766,awesome fun in CoOp
15767,Great Game !!
15768,"Play this game on co-op, it's amazing! It's FPS meets Diablo!"
15769,Really good to play with friends. Even better to duel them with >:)
15770,great game. diablo meets fallout.
15771,"Fast paced, hilariously written, and beautifully rendered, this game has definitely become one of my favorites after only a few hours."
15772,love this game shame is taken me so long to get it
15773,"An excellently fun game with friends, that you can play for a great number of hours."
15774,"Friggin' mindless fun, just get 3 friends and go crazy"
15775,the perfect game for kleptomaniacs who like guns
15776,Fantastic game! It's like Diablo for gun nuts!
15777,Best game to play @ LANs. Halarious!
15778,"Imagine Diablo II as a first person shooter with a whole lot of guns, millions of them, but while they are all *technically* different, they are all almost functionally the same. Then imagine absolutely no storyline. Now make it ten million times worse. Each mission will delight you as it finds a new way to tell you to ""GO KILL TEN BEARS AND COLLECT THEIR ASSES, ALSO ONLY 1 IN 5 BEARS HAS AN A S S."" Now imagine instead of having a trees of skills that you can pick and that actually make a meaningful difference in how you play, having only one ability that adds no strategy to the gameplay. That's Borderlands."
15779,"Despite being less of an RPG than I usually play, I keep coming back to it for a few hours of mindless fun."
15780,"I feel like I've sunk half of my life into this game by now, and it still is tremendous fun. One of the few games that tries to be funny and actually succeeds, as far as I'm concerned. Also: lots of guns. Ridiculous amounts of ridiculous guns. It'll make you crave guns, and we all know craving guns is supremely silly.

Two of the DLC packs are forgettable, sadly (I'm looking through my ridiculous sniper scope at you, Moxxi's Underdome and Robot Revolution), but the other two are great (Zombie Island of Dr. Ned) to supergreat (Secret Armory of General Knoxx)! So that kind of makes it even Steven!"
15781,Imagine getting violently fisted by an elephant or 3 hours of getting butt-fucked by a gorilla on live television because this game is nothing like that
15782,This game is terrific! highly recommended if you think you'd like an FPS/RPG type combo.
15783,"This is a game where you can have a revolver that thinks it is a shotgun that fires rockets, it uses pistol ammo.  What's not to love?"
15784,Very fun game and it is a first person shooter with tons of missions and great dlc
15785,Best shooter in a long time.  With a lot of RPG elements.
15786,awesum
15787,Do you like guns?  Do you like Diablo II?  You will like this.
15788,"If you like first person shooters, then you have to get this. The game is not lying when it says it has so many guns, and each type of gun has it's own proficiency level. Add in leveling up and talent trees, and you have yourself an amazing role-playing shooter."
15789,"Really fun to game to play with friends, tons of loot and different class to play as."
15790,The best combination of random stat loot and first person shooter ever created!
15791,"What would happen if someone made a first-person shooter that used Diablo II's loot-generating system?

What if it had a trashpunk setting?

And made heavy use of the many colours between brown and gray?

The answer is: Borderlands."
15792,Awesome.. well worth it..
15793,Awsome game but does need some persoverance to begin with.
15794,"An almost perfect blend of cooperative first person shooter and diablo-style role playing game, Borderlands (and its now beefy stack of DLC) seems to scratch all the right itches and demands to be played, (especially with up to three of your friends)! Grinding your way through the story solo doesn't come as highly reccommended, but even if you are partner-challenged, the lighthearted (but mature) tone and graphic novel style art direction will make Borderlands quite memorable."
15795,Nice one
15796,"An absolutly amazing game, so much to do and so much to laugh about. excellent online or offline"
15797,"its grrrrrr8 ,get it now"
15798,"Balls-out anarchic fun, best done in co-op."
15799,"Half decent story, tons of humour, guts and glory.
Oh and a bazillion guns ;)"
15800,"Loot,  lots of loot.  Guns and loot,  and loot that is guns."
15801,"A first person shooter RPG. Punch a midget, watch him explode."
15802,"i recommend
"
15803,good
15804,"Listen.  This game is an absolute blast with any friends.  Tons of hours of gameplay, three out of four DLCs are spot on excellent and there's plenty of replayability with the four classes.

The only downside is that the server host (the player who invites everyone else) has complete control over the missions you can and can't do; if the invities are behind in the story line, they won't get credit for any missions, and likewise people further along will get slightly hosed until the leader catches up.

Get this game if you have a couple bros and/or broettes!"
15805,"Its a great game to play with friends. Plus, making a recommendation is a freebie ticket in the summersale."
15806,"Pew pew, bang bang, shoot 'em up, rock out hardcore, kick ass, take names, get money, get guns. Live life like a thug-gangsta in the unforgiving badlands (ha, that's a map in tf2.) Then realize you're just being used. You're always being used, just a mindless, soulless automaton forever set to wander the earth. BUT YOU DO IT IN STYLE AND YOU PAINT THE WORLD IN PAIN. 
Awesome."
15807,100+ hours spent on it and i still can't get enought out of it! Tongue in the cheek humor and so many pop culture references that's impossible to not like this game.
15808,Pritty much the best game ever!
15809,Still the best!
15810,Bora jogar cambada
15811,"A First Person Shooter RPG, Borderlands manages to give players the best of both worlds; questing, talent trees, classes, gear & other loot lives side by side with critical headshots, finding cover, & the love/hate relationship many gamers have with their guns. An original, though heavily foreshadowed storyline is further built upon with a number of unexpected & usually unscripted intense moments, a large helping of humor, as well as a considerable number of entertaining references to movies & other games.
Solo players may tire of the game after the first 30 character levels, but anyone with one or more friends available for cooperative play is in for literally hundreds of hours of enjoyment. The basic game has a second, harder playthrough available after completing the storyline with a character- you get to keep all of your hard-earned loot, so no worries there- and the extra downloadable content adds new areas, dangers, & strategies for anyone left wanting more."
15812,this is a good game with many interesting shapes
15813,"I LOVE this game... i played it over and over and over again and i can still get surprised sometimes, it's a masterpiece.
100/100 :)"
15814,240 hours played.  Enough said.  Sci-fi diablo FPS with a twisted humor.
15815,"Great game to play with friends, mixes FPS and RPG elements to form a fun gameplay experience :)"
15816,"Great game, a million things to do from each character and both playthroughs"
15817,"incredibly long and in depth single player experience, with the ability to hop-in, hop-out of your friend's quests and give them a hand, each DLC has a unique flavor to it which brings great variety to the gameplay"
15818,Really nice game.
15819,"Great game if you love low gravity, lots of bandits/aliens and Bazillions of guns!"
15820,Iz gud.
15821,Very nice!
15822,Only bad thing about it is the guns randomazation is sometimes to random. Who wants a amazing scope on a shotgun?
15823,"Det er et fremragende FPS-RPG med mange, forskellige karakterer, områder og missioner; men først og fremmest er det utroligt flot og detaljerigt."
15824,"Do you like shooting things?  Do you like leveing up and applying points in skill/ability trees?  Do you like loot?  Do you like guns?  Do you like games with distinctive art styles and genuinely funny writing?

Look no further.  Borderlands is a delicious stew of shooter, RPG and loot-gathering hack and slash/MMO.

EDIT: Winner of The “Test of Time” Award!"
15825,"Some folks have described it as ""Diablo with guns,"" and I can see where they're coming from.  Fun and funny, Borderlands gets better when you play with friends, not that it isn't great alone.  CATCH-A-RIIIIIDE!!"
15826,"One of my absolute favorite games of all time! Cool characters, incredible overabundance of guns, an awesome art style, & replay value . I Love It!"
15827,"WOW! Seriously, how can you say any more than that?  I seriously wasn't sure about it at first, but now I fire this up JUST to roam the wasteland.  The graphic style is... absolutely fitting, the story is just enough to keep you motivated to pursue the next goal, and there is almost nothing more rewarding than watching that bad guy melting after a killer Corrosion Critical!!!"
15828,"It's all about gear in this game. At least for me it was.
The weapons/shields and other upgrades are randomly created from various parts. Most guns look different and variate in damage, fire rate and accuracy.
Getting rare end-game guns is a bit of a grind, but finding this high damage shotgun-like revolver is awesome imho.
The story is pretty solid, not that important. To me it lacked some synchronization. 
You can choose between four characters. All of them have specialities like placing a sentry-turret or calling in a bird to help.
Also they all have different skilltrees and can gain weapon proficiencies. There's a learning courve, what guns to keep and which to throw away.
The vanilla game lets you level up to 58 afaik. With the DLC (Knoxx) the level cap is increased to 69. The GOTY version is absolutly worth it, but I guess we just missed the sale.
The singleplayer is the same as co-op and players can join almost instantly. There's a lot more to this game, than a mere FPS.
pm4game"
15829,Borderlands is for you if you enjoy FPS. Especially if you enjoy the concept of RPG's but can't stand the turn-based or grid-based combat systems. This FPS-RPG mixes the two elements quite well and can be a blast when played with the right friends.
15830,"Awesome game. Best FPS/RPG out there for now. Buy the GOTY if anything, the DLCs are worth it"
15831,"I love Borderlands. I haven't gotten a chance to play multiplayer yet, and I really want to, which is partly the reason I am writing this recommendation. The other part is that even the single player part of Borderlands is awesome, and it well worth playing. The art style of the game is fun yet sophisticated(in a brutal way that gives it it's unique appeal) and the game mechanics themselves... are wonderful. So many weapons! Gahh! I'm having trouble articulating how awesome this game is - a problem I rarely run into. You know that means it's good. 
"
15832,"Don't let the ""look how gory we can be"" advertising campaign turn you off to this game.  The gore level isn't as bad as the hype suggests, and it's a great game.  FPS, with Diablo-style RPG character advancement and four classes.  I've enjoyed the heck out of it.

You can get the Game of the Year edition (which includes all four expansion packs) for only $7.50 if you can catch it during one of the infrequent 75% off sales,"
15833,<3
15834,"If you like FPS games, you need to try this.  If you like RPG games, you need to try it, too!  (You don't have to go get the sheep that were lost, and are just two fields over...  ;)"
15835,This is a game for REAL gamers! You want Peggle? Go fuck yourself!
15836,fun game to play when you are bored and want to punch a midgets leg off
15837,Sehr Guter Coop und auch im SInglepalyer mehr als genial...  Empfehlenswert für jeden Ego Shooter Fan :D
15838,Best FPS RPG there is. Oarsumness.
15839,"Lootastical co-op game that... know what? I did this for the Summer Camp ticket. My mother always said it pays to be honest, so there ya go. Buy Borderlands. Do it now. mwa xoxo"
15840,"pretty cool game, you shoot bad guys and you dont afraid of aniything."
15841,"In this hybrid RPG/FPS, shootin’ ‘n’ lootin’ is the aim of the game. There are lots of guns in Borderlands and Gearbox claim that the number of different guns that could possibly appear in the game stretches into the millions. Borderlands is host to some seriously satisfying gunplay. Missions tend to be of the ‘go there. shoot that’ variety, but the blasting is meaty and effortlessly fun. Four-player online co-op mode is arguably how Borderlands is meant to be played but watch out for loot-hoovers! Loot-gathering becomes compulsive, you just have to keep searching for that perfect rifle."
15842,"Nobody expected Borderlands to be a totally addicting and clever FPS/Diablo hybrid. But low and behold, it's a great shooter mixed with an addictive loot system, humorous characters and quests, and a big world to explore. Gearbox really outdid themselves on this one. Here we have a truly great game, maybe even an awesome game. I highly recommend it either for solo play or LAN/Internet Co-op. Very much looking forward to Borderlands 2!"
15843,"Many, Many hours of great co-op fun to be had in here. Enquire within for Phat Loots."
15844,"A Diablo esk game meets an FPS. Roam through the rich detailed world of pandora to unlock the secret of the legendary Vault. Do quests in a unique story and get loot in the classic diablo style, random modifiers and aweseomt combinations.

Also try the DLC. DR Neds island is pandora view of a zombie apocolypse, Mad Moxie' Underdome (beyond the thunderdome get it) is an arena style game. Still working on the other two myself, but this game is proving to be one of those that I keep revisit many times to see if i happened to miss that one chest in an area I didnt think to check to get the best loot."
15845,Fun and interesting. Art Deco + Splattering Brains = fun in Borderlands.
15846,"A Great game to play on your own, even better when playing with you're friends and the DLCs are good addition to a great game"
15847,A lot of fun in CO-OP
15848,"It's time to cut through all the bullshit. This is the game that will make you strong. No lies. No bullshit. No half truths. No gorilla dust. Damn it, it's time to make a man out of you. Your mother's concerned, boy. She's seen you up nights dancing in front of your mirror. You a pretty girl, boy? You a pretty pretty princess with pink poka dot panties? Huh? Fuck you, that's what. Turn around. Now face me. FACE ME! Now put your good pants on, boy. It's time to go get ice cream. And by ""go get ice cream"" I mean stomping small animals to death with my knee-high Nazi leather jackboots. God, I need a drink. Just a shot of something powerful. As strong and stiff as your mother's pubes, boy. Shit, you don't even know. You don't know. You CAN'T know what I seen, boy! I seen shit. I seen shit that'd make you shit. Shit I need a drink. Four walls and a coke, boy. That's what I promised the preacher for you. ""Til' death do us part""? Not by a damn sight, boy. Now let's go get that ice cream."
15849,"Fun game, bosses aren't much of a challenge though."
15850,Awesome game!
15851,"If you're looking for some fast-paced fun that involves shooting things and taking their stuff, and you have friends who'll come along for the ride, you could do a lot worse than a romp through Borderlands' irreverent world of Pandora.  It's entertained my circle of FPS fans for hundreds of hours."
15852,NICE CO-OP GAME!!!
15853,"Get this game ! It is so mutch fun in co op and the loot you get ... Fire shooting pistols , Lightning shooting Smg's .. what do you want more? GET THIS GAME when steam got it on sale again."
15854,Get it.
15855,"Shoot things, Get loot...

Kinda like World of Warcraft but with Guns..."
15856,"Only after a few minutes of gameplay i can say this is a ""must have"""
15857,Fantastic!!!!
15858,A great game!!!
15859,Original and interesting mix of MMO and FPS. Nice game to co-op with your friends.
15860,"Only bought it because it was on sale, but I'm shocked how much fun this is. Like a action/lite-rpg, but an excellent bargain. Wish I would have known about it earlier!"
15861,"Many guns,Co-Op,running things over in a car. FUN TIMES WILL BE HAD!"
15862,Looting and collecting weapons has never been more fun and addictive.
15863,Bestes Rollenspiel Ever!
15864,"This game reminds me of HalfLife and Halo, but at the same time being completely unique and completely awesome!"
15865,"great game, should get it"
15866,"Get this game, it's hella fun! :)"
15867,Good
15868,"it's awesome!
4 classes
lots of skills
and millions of guns.."
15869,STRIP THE FLESH! SALT THE WOUND!
15870,"Undoubtedly one of the best Action RPG games out there. The graphic style is unique, there are a ridiculously huge number of guns to find, the action is fluid, the quests never get dull and the world of Pandora is amazing. Deffiently one of the best games that came out of 2009."
15871,"Borderlands is a great game, like a meld between an MMO and a FPS without the lag. Co-op is brilliant, but the system seems flawed, and is only worth palying with friends and some type of voice chat as single player can seem slow and tedious. The NPC killing is brilliantly crafted for those with skill and accuracy, for ""soft spots"" and ""weaknesses"" on the NPC's is what half the game is all about. It can get a bit hectic, but that just means you should be taking it slow, and using cover. A game that teaches you strategy while giving you fun and comedy, it's a must play."
15872,awesome game specially with al the dlc it has well worth getting
15873,"Borderlands is fun, if you have four friends. However, it's hardly spectacular. There are better diabloesque games."
15874,"Brilliant game, would be amazing if i could get all my mates to play it with me."
15875,"This game is really bad. It relies on coop to carry it's ratings, although any game can be fun with the right people to play with. If you plan to play alone then just don't touch it."
15876,"Grab a friend or more and have a blast, this game is fun with friends on teamspeak/vent/skype.

4/5 for team games
2/5 for single player

Single player is the same story line and quests as multiplayer but by yourself."
15877,"A fantastic game to enjoy with friends, but beyond that it's a generic, uninspired class based shooter. The single player mode is a waste of time."
15878,"
It's Borderlands what can I say? I've even bought the game twice, I have it on PS3 aswell! It's a RPG, FPS and it's great fun! It's made by Gearbox and it's based around a coop game, since it's 4 player coop. You are a searching for a Vault that has a secret don't want to give any spoliers here so I'll stop there. It's a great game and it's been on Steam's special list a lot! The one thing that is even better with this is the DLC because there is a lot more hours game play with it. So if you're going to buy this game I would recommend you to find 3 friends and go all out on a weekend then BUY THE DLC! If I was going to rate this game I'd rate it a 10/10 so go ahead and buy it now!"
15879,1000 hours of heavy fun !
15880,Looks great and plays well. Multi-player networking sucks (uses GameSpy instead of Steam client) and joining friends online is a pain. Co-op play is good but lot of folks are playing with hacked weapons which takes the fun out of gameplay.
15881,"This isn't your regular FPS game. This is a dungeon crawler FPS. As such play it as one:

- Get some friends and defeat the hellish multiplayer setup problems (Note: Google Gameranger)
- Grab some mics and fight against your friends for the sweetest loot. 
- Enjoy the all the jokes, comedy, parody and satire holding together the awful plot.
- Grab the DLC for more and for Moxxy.

Don't let me fool you though. This is indeed a game worth picking on the nowadays nice price. But it loses all its appeal if you play it alone. If possible just get that party full and all mic'ed up."
15882,"Fun for a bit but ends up being very monotonous. I started listening to Cage the Elephant after hearing the opening song to this game, so it has that going for it!"
15883,Simply some of the most fun co-op I've ever done... Part FPS part RPG this game is great!
15884,"good game does get boring when you complete it
"
15885,"Hackers,

Hackers everywhere.

Other than that i suggest staying the fuck offline with random people and only play with people you know.

And if you have nobody to play with... then lets just say this game gets lonely as hell.

Still fun tho with the FPS and RPG mix"
15886,"Game of the Year 2009 no doubt. Co-op shooting at it's best. The voice acting is great, the guns feel great, and the RPG elements have the perfect level of depth."
15887,<3d it so much. To be honest the ending was a bit of a dissapointment but I'm yet to play the DLCs. So I guess the fun isn't completely over. -_-
15888,"Exceptional game, disgraceful plot. Never a miscommunication."
15889,"Hell, easily one of the BEST games ever created. FPS + RPG. Oh and don't forget the guns. Over 100 Million of them. I'll take anyone on in a duel any time, any day."
15890,"Very fun, diverse satirical and dark shooter RPG. Main story is quite intruiging, and sidequests aren't a bore, or chore. Skillset customization and evolution is well-designed and fun to progress through.

The art is very unique, and very well-done. The in-game music is pretty good, but loops too often. I've started to tune it out. I love the number and diverse nature of the guns. You can snipe, run headfirst into a fight with a shotgun, rain bullets with a rifle or SMG, or even go a bit brawler and just run around punching things.

The classes in borderlands don't limit your weapon use. They provide bonuses, or special abilities.

All in all a very well-done RPG that has impressed a staunch anti-RPG gamer :P."
15891,"This is a good one.  You could pretty much call this 'Diablo Fallout'.  1st person, RPG with lots of loot.  Guns, shield, class and grenade augments.  However, once you have at least one other person, this game opens up to even more fun.  There are arenas, mobs get tougher and drops get better.  I would wait for a sale since when it does go on sale on Steam, it's literally a steal!"
15892,"You know you want it - especially if you've got a friend to play it with.
Unforunately the multiplayer works through less than perfect GameSpy and you can NOT play together with your console owning friends. (PC to PC, PS3 to PS3, XBOX360 to XBOX360... -_-; )
You can extend the fun with excellent DLC's."
15893,"I'm Detructoid and I think Borderlands was good and that Gearbox makes good games.


I also am a dumb bitch who also thought Cavestory was better then HL2

What a buch of Coldplay lovers."
15894,The Game Of The Year edition of this game is packed with more game that most games ever hope to cram into one game. That's a lot of game.
15895,Get Borderlands Game of the Year Edition and let's play 4P!
15896,
15897,Hilarious mix of FPS & RPG ;-)
15898,"This was a great adventure to play with a good friend of mine. The game is solid, has a massive landscape, contains different weapon classes, and is overall a blast to play through. Overall the boss fights in this game let me honestly say 7/10 is how i felt after finishing this game. Good times!"
15899,"Once in a while, I need a break from choice-based games and so I look for something that is completely over the top, fresh, fun and has that ""cinematic"" feel to it. Well, guess what? Borderlands is all those things and more! While I am not a fan of first-person games, Borderlands makes things fun with over-the-top humor in the style of Mad TV, has a fresh and unique look on gameplay with BAZILLIONS of different weapons, upgrades and so on, memorable characters that all have different attitudes, and some of the best boss battles I have ever come across! 

Not to mention playing this brings back the days where I used spend my time playing Diablo 2. I HIGHLY recommend you get this game. While it is a graphic-demanding game, it is so worth playing."
15900,real nice
15901,If you like diablo style games and fps. They had a baby. You will love playing this coop. So dont buy it unless u and some friends are also buying it. force everyone to go through it together and not play without everyone. it;s a great coop playthrough experiance.
15902,"If you enjoyed first person shooters (FPS) and the gameplay/loot system that Blizzard employed in Diablo/Diablo2, you will absolutely love this game. Loads of weapons, lots of DLC content, and some of the best coop gaming available right now!

I'd throw down a 4/5."
15903,"Great game that can provide you with many hours of good fun!

However, I DO NOT recommend the DLC since I wasn't EVER able to play them... thank you Securom! I will NOT disable my antivirus and firewall just to play some DLC.

So Gearbox, would you stop using that aberration of Securom DRM? Especially for DLC!"
15904,"Diablo 2 meets a Post Apoc FPS? Fantastic. 

While single player may be a slight bore due to lack of definite direction, the game truly excells when you play with friends.

I won't really get into the mechanics of the game because it seems like everyone has their own way to go about things in game (sweet!).

Give it a whirl, or simply come on over sometime and give it a shot at my place.

Note:
No, Borderlands does not accurately support true widescreen resolutions, it uses -vert instead of +hoz so boo on that. Definitely not on my list of recommended games for Eyefinity users.,"
15905,"Diablo with guns.  Do you like diablo games?  Do you like FPS?  Then get this.  Its awsome, especially with friends."
15906,"A unique blend of RPG and FPS action. The SP campaign is tons of fun and combined with the 4-player co-op makes for some insanely fun gameplay. I guarantee you will like, if not love, this game."
15907,"A crazy-good FPS with RPG elements, borderlands features you playing as one of four ""Vault Hunters"" on the lawless planet Pandora. You can even team up online to take on quests or go PVP in an arena. This game also features a wickedly good sense of humor, so there's laughs as well as almost nonstop action. Pick this game up!"
15908,"Hugely fun game, RPG shooter in the diablo way. 4 player co-op, bucket loads of guns that do many cool things. I have a SMG that fire explosive ammo, emptying the clip is like a personal artilary strike. This game rocks hard."
15909,this game is the shiz
15910,"Fantastic game,best played with friends rather than alone"
15911,Co-op or solo this game is a blast great mix of FPS and RPG. Pretty decent humor too. Gearbox has made a great title here check it out.
15912,"It's like an MMO, Except it doesn't suck and reward you for feeding it your life.
"
15913,The best FPS RPG bar none.
15914,"A game among games that's well worth playing and will keep you running back for more. With plenty of content, multiple DLCs, this game is a must have if you enjoy both roleplaying games and shooters. The attraction to this game is not just the storyline, but the unusual combination between having guns and playing the role of a treasure hunter. Sure, sure, the idea sounds like it's been done before and the graphics look like a cartoon, but it's like the trite phrases go: ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" and ""don't knock it 'til you try it."" Features include: Witty dialogue, hours of gameplay, skillbuilding, difficult enemies, and so on! TRY IT! NOW!


Addendum, years later in June, 2019:
Borderlands 3 is just over the horizon. This game hasn't aged the greatest, but has received a visual overhaul, some bugs fixed, and still has replayability. My love for the game extends to Borderlands 2 as one of the greatest titles in the franchise and I am eager to see what Borderlands 3 brings to the table. With a little bit of luck, I might be able to coax friends into binging the series leading up to its release."
15915,"The most fun I've had in a long time. It's basically Diablo with guns. It's especially fun with a few friends! But single player and replaying it can get old, so it's best to play with some friends. It's a good game; it could use some improvements, such as actual weapon customization, but whatever. There ae a BAZILLION guns, so you probably won't find the same thing twice."
15916,Is good.
15917,An FPS with a sense of humor and a bit of a campy arcadish feel.
15918,Great RPG/shooter.  I love borderlands.  The addition of diablo random loot with a great first person shooter is unstoppable.  Will be playing this over and over for a long long time.
15919,"It's like playing Diablo except with guns! SMGs, Revolvers, Repeaters, Combat Rifles, Sniper Rifles, Launchers, and some kinda alien weapons.  4 classes all with skill trees and one main skill. Brawler has a rage that heals him, siren can go invisible, hunter has a cool fire bird that flies around killing shit, and the soldier can drop turrets that do a variety of things.  I personally love the game. I can't wait for Borderlands 2 to come out."
15920,"Random gun generator? Yes please ;D
The only time I really enjoy being a sniper class, S&S loyalty with the Liquid Orion, Thanatos, Defiler, and Volcano. They all make a happy face."
15921,"I fell asleep playing this
nice nap simulator"
15922,epic for th e win.
15923,Gearbox makes amazing games like this. It's Diablo item hording meets first person shooter. Way fun and addicting. Good multiplayer options for getting and giving help playing the games massive story. Good amount of DLC and all of it worth it. Definetly buy the Game of the Year Edition to save some money over buying it all separately.
15924,"Awesome game, lots of guns, though a bit slow for itemization at the start. Sucks that you have to register for GameSpy for multiplayer though."
15925,Had an amazing time playing this game.  Definitely better than people led me to believe. 9/10 for me
15926,"Finally, a game with a sense of humor... interesting art design... badass skills and weapons. Easily makes my top 10 games in the recent years. Fun games are harder and harder to find.. Borderlands = <3"
15927,"4 player co-op, role playing first person shooter.  Genius and with comedy relief from Claptrap, I like Taylor Kobb's Claptrap best.  There are millions of guns too.  Brilliant game."
15928,"Fun. Nice change in visuals to the usual FPS. High replayability with new DLC and optional class changes. Unfortunately not as many guns as I'd hoped, only about 10 models just with 100 different scopes and colours and specs. Overall, it's a fun game to muck around with mates either on LAN or P2P, and a good game in general. Definitely a stand out from the pack."
15929,yum
15930,RPG + FPS + 4 player coop + hours of gameplay = Borderlands. Awesome.
15931,"This game will keep you busy, plus there are tons of guns to play with that do so many other things. I LOVE IT!!"
15932,Get off my bus.
15933,GET IT AND LET'S PLAY ONLINE
15934,"Borderlands has a unique visual style, crass humor and an absolute heap of randomised guns. It’s also a decent multiplayer RPG that isn’t one of “those” *cough*MMORPGs*cough*. While the consolisation doesn't transfer too well over to PC and the story, wait, what story? It certainly doesn't impede upon the hours of fun roaming about, questing and decimating everything in sight. The drop-in drop-out system is also very convenient for your buddies, who are a must to play with to get the most out of this game. Oh, the DLC is relatively top notch too with lots of extra content."
15935,"Excellent game, even better with three or 4 people :) Well worth the money, and the DLC makes a great game even better :)"
15936,Love love love LOVE this game :D
15937,"It's the perfect combination of shooter and RPG, the story is a bit simple but the game is really fun if you play with friends."
15938,Ja ich empfehle es.
15939,Four player co-op. A suberb blend of FPS and RPG attributes. This game is excellent.
15940,"One of the best Co-Op games avaliable today. You can customise your character, lots of different weapons, maps, enemies, boss'. And, if you purchase the dlc's......more fun!"
15941,"Best FPS/RPG hybrid I've seen. Great characters and fun sense of humor. The multiplayer was rocky at launch, but it has improved greatly since then. All of the DLC with the exception of Moxie add good campaign content (Moxie adds coop arena survival mode and bank storage). This is one of those games that I am always willing to drop things to hop into."
15942,"Borderlands is a great game. There is co-op up to 4 friends, 87 billizion guns in the game, and it has RPG elements in a first person shooter. If you love to level up, get new guns, and play with your friends all at the same time, this game is for you. The guns range from snipers, rockets, machine guns, handguns, and shotguns. The guns are creative and bring a feel of the world you are on. Each character that you can be has their own special abilities and each one has it's own mod. The mods can give your allies ammo, health, boost to your current health, or a boost to your current shield. The game has a comic book look to the game and it fits just right. With the 4 other exapnsions you get with the game, you have hundreds of hours of gameplay with your friends. You can play with other people in public games, and depending on the host, it could be fun or just a waste of time. Borderlands has a feel of action with a little funnies to it, and you will laugh at the jokes they make. BUY!"
15943,Boom
15944,"If you like guns, loot, humor, class archetypes, endless replayability, and more guns, then this is your place to be.  Great multiplayer experiences and fun leveling up system.  This game is way more than worth the money by now.  Get it!"
15945,Fun times. Diablo + Half-Life. Come play with me sometime.
15946,"""The HORDE WAVE has come to eat you! Om nom nom nom!"
15947,must have :)
15948,Bring me a bucket... And I will show you a bucket!
15949,Great single player and great co-op. I had to eat my words when I didn't think this was worth playing. Boy was I ever wrong. The uncanny amount of weapons and items you can get are amazing. Great FPS gameplay and the leveling up system is a blast for RPG gamers. Can't get enough of this game.
15950,"Borderlands is what happens when Gearbox isn't working on someone else's franchise. Read: Gearbox can't design a game worth shit unless someone else has already laid the groundwork.

So you've got a million fucking guns and they all do the same thing which is shoot bullets that kill things. But some of them suck. And it's completely random which ones suck. After scrounging through about 35 thousand of them, you finally find one you like and you equip it. Seven seconds later, the game dumps a better weapon on you.

The cycle repeats into infinity. (Or until you finish the game, which is about four seconds after you find that last gun.)

The final boss is a reskinned version of the final boss from Opposing Force. Do you see what I'm getting at here? After a short, unfufilling run through the wastelands of  Pansnora, Gearbox then turns around and releases the fun and interesting parts of the game as paid DLC.

At least you got a demo of Duke Nukem Forever out of it."
15951,"Time Bought: 13 months after release
Money Spent: $10 on steam sale
Worth The Price?: YES, and then some
Position In Game At Time Of Review:  max leveling out my last class, finished game multilple times

Fun, addictive, multiplayer....great game all together!  The little things are great like easter eggs, looks, taunts, GUNS, but you're not really playing the game unless you get the DLCs."
15952,"Just like Diablo, Borderlands is an addictive item-scavenging rpg.  Calling Borderlands an RPG might be a bit of a stretch considering its very limited skill options, however its mission style and item focus lends heavily to MMORPGs and Diablo-style action RPGs.  Although very playable, with a very original artistic style, Borderlands only has mildly engaging story which gives it next to no replayability, unless you fiend for the neverending quest for better items of co-op with friends."
15953,Fan Fuckingtastic!
15954,"I think I have to change my perception of what a firearm is. Guns... So many guns...
"
15955,"This game is great. Do you ever thought of playing WoW(hate the game) with your friends with FPS style and RPG element without a monthly fee? Then this game is perfect for you. Enjoy a journey in search of a vault filled with valuable treasures. Up to four people could play together and killed things for money and exp. There are many guns you could collect to see what kind of guns do you prefer killing with.

 The plot is crap. There is almost to no character interaction with any NPCs. There is some, but it was a disapointment IMO."
15956,"Great fun, yes?"
15957,"Everything that made Diablo 2 so horribly addictive, now with guns, a hilarious script, and beautiful art style. Buy it now and enjoy heaps of bandit and critter squishing goodness. People who take themselves too seriously need not apply."
15958,"Interesting graphics but getting new skils, fps action gameplay and gun collection are all very fun aspects to this game.  The sense of humor is also very good in my opinion, lots of clever puns, irony and amusing character dialog."
15959,"Bloody FANTASTIC! picked up Borderlands and all the DLC on the sale they had a while back and haven't been able to stop playing, this game is awesome, just remember to turn off aim assist and stuff. what more can i say, don't have it then get it."
15960,"very unique FPS that is more closer to diablo than it is to call of duty. The game is fun but loses it's apeal very quickly.

PROS
-cool graphics
-lots of LOOT

CONS
-Inventory management is a disaster
-lots of really bad design and bugs

-7.5/10"
15961,"A great FPS shooting experience joined at the hip with the RPG loot dropping and level grinding mechanics of games like Diablo and Torchlight and colored by goofy juvenile humor and an evocative art style that is both memorable and capable of delivering environments with character and personality.  In fact the word ""personality"" is the thing Borderlands has for it above all else.

4 character classes to choose from that allow you to tailor your gameplay in numerous enjoyable ways and a leveling system that is pretty rapid and delivers noticeable improvements as you go.

DLC is mixed with only Knoxx providing a 4 star result, but the rest are fun too.  Can be played single player quite well, but 4 player co-op is where it's at.  Damn good fun and I hope there'll be a sequel."
15962,"Borderlands is a kick-ass FPS with some nice RPG elements added to it. You kill stuff, level up and scavenge for loot which ranges from guns and shield to class upgrades, money and more. There is a ridiculous amount of weapons in the game to collect, some say around 10.000, each with their own unique stats. The game also has a very stylish cell-shaded look to it, which sets it apart from other games.

Borderlands provides a nice single player experience but really comes to life with its co-op mode! Playing with friends is so much more fun and really gives a whole new twist to the game. Lastly, there is plenty of DLC to extend the game so be sure to pick this one up!"
15963,"  Borderlands has a little age, but that doesn't diminish its value any; its affordability lends itself well to 4-player shenanigans. You and up to three friends are pitted against a plethora of foes using a randomly-generated assortment of weaponry and items.
  While the game has a ""story"", its merit lies in its ability to experience the entire thing with your friends. A large variety of side-quests and up to 3 playthroughs on a single character (with the level of enemies scaling each time) mean you could invest a lot of time into this game, even on a single ""run"".
  However, Borderlands does have some issues. Some people I've played with complain of random (but eventual) crashes, and far too often the ""loot chest"" system decides it wants to give one character type all the gear (for instance, insisting that the Hunter needs more sniper rifles). Barring that, it is a classic for anyone with three friends and way too much time on their hands, and its GOTY award is well-deserved."
15964,"The best RPG/FPS game I have played, get some friends on and it's even better!"
15965,this is the best thing next to shitting without having to wipe
15966,Because i got a massive erection while playing it
15967,"It's Diablo 2 as a first person shooter and guns.  What's not to like?

P.S.  The story is mediocre at best but the ending is one of the worst of any video game I've played."
15968,"Not much story, but the action is fun.  You have to like your First Person Shooters to enjoy it because that is all the game is, Shooting.  The game is structured similarity to Diablo 2.  You get quests, leave town, kill things, back to town, hand in and sell your loot.  

Borderlands has a levelling system which makes the game less dependent on player skill, and much more dependent on player level and talents.  The whole game feels a little too ""Pen and Paper""ish.  This is not helped by some of the failures of the engine. The one that annoyed me the most was enemies reacting to my shots before my bullets even hit them.  This was particularly obvious when sniping.  

Although it suffers for being a console port, it is still a fun game.  It does have a terrible FOV but you can change it on the fly with only a quick edit of .ini file."
15969,Definitely in my top 10 games of all time. I've played nearly 200 hours of this RPG shooter with awesome lootz.
15970,"Yet another lazy console to PC port. I wish I had read the reviews of the game before purchasing it... it's not a bad game, just not very well thought-out, and how low quality the PC port is a big turn-off. Gameplay is decent but very low-brow, even for a shooter. You kill the same 4 or-so NPCs over and over and AI is pretty much as simple as they get. There is an addictive, Diablo-esque item system, but it hardly overcomes the games gross shortcomings."
15971,"You may guess that Borderlands is awesome game? - It is! There is a lot to do and with Co-Op, it gives you some more challenge, so just pick your character and go roll with some deadly & destructive weapons & skills! - Bad side of this game is, however... When you've played it once, you won't like to play it again soon... Boring... Boring... BOOOORIIING!!"
15972,Most addicting game ever o3o!
15973,"Cross borders across the land with this hi-tech city building simulator. The power is in your hands as you work around the clock to provide jobs, attractions and utilities for your personal bustling metropolis. Includes FREE downloadable content packs featuring new building types, road textures and pipe shapes."
15974,Wanna see what the USA will look like in 100 years or so? Borderlands.
15975,"Not a great console port, but understandably its because Gearbox had no idea how big a hit it would be on PC.   Luckily they removed Gamespy and enabled coop again, and this story really does begin here.

On playing the DLC, it's kinda glitchy in some missions.  Hard to recommend when they still haven't worked out the bugs after all this time."
15976,"The fact i've got 140 hours in this game is enough of a recommendation. Very fun and well written, played through it many times with friends."
15977,"Verdict: Game With Friends

If you have friends with voice chat, and atleast 4 hours of free time to kill, pick up Borderlands.
Now when I say 4 hours to kill, do I mean Borderlands is short? GOD NO. You won't be able to stop playing for 4 hours.
It does have it's faults (non battle music is dull) and it would be an incredibly boring game in single player, but this is a very good game with friends. It's even beaten out Left 4 Dead 2 in total play time. Admittedly I like L4D2 more than BL, but the simple fact I've played it so long means it's worth the money."
15978,"Borderlands is a nicely made sci-fi FPS-RPG.
+/-
Im not the kinda person who likes games with bilions of weapons and items to loot. But it  kept my interest through.
I loved metaapocalyptic environments in games and Borderlands was the kind of game that offered me the experience i wanted on a very fun way.
Most features were expected. The gamin system is nice, the plot is good, the blood is fun. Nice and simple leveling system. Lots of quests to do.
But what REALLY made me love this game was something very specific.
The unique graphics design.
The game is totally cartoonised, as if it came to digi-life right inside a manga book.
It totally took me back to when I used to read Trigun.
And to be honest, there's a high chance the designer of the game to be a sick Trigun fan.
Very nice lines and effects out there.
What i didn't like that much is that all vilains have the same mask and are male.
Good think there are  various mobs to kill .
in average: a nice and interesting game. fun to play"
15979,This game has Zillions of guns in it. If you like First Person Shooters with a action adventure leveling up style then this title is for you. Plus the 4 player co-op through the whole story and also the add-ons makes hours upon hours of freaking fun!
15980,"A good combination of loot-collection based rpg and first person shooter. Borderlands is full of pop culture references, bizarre looking enemies and diverse guns. Go for the Game of the Year Edition, the 4 DLC packs add a lot to this game. Unfortunately there's no proper trading or loot sharing system, so I recommend only playing this with friends or alone, though you might run into some nice people in public matches. Now that the multiplayer is handled by Steamworks online co-op has become a much smoother experience."
15981,"A great game when played with friends, but pretty meh when alone."
15982,"Borderlands sports a unique cell shaded graphical style, excellent gameplay as well as the BEST coop seen by far. This game is way to much with friends, so many weapons, so many quests way too much to do. Its way to much fun. I highly reccomend it if you like playing games with your friends."
15983,"Dude, if you like or even LOVE games that comes with, EXPLODING HEADS, MUTANT DOGS/SKAGS, FLYING DEATH AND BANDITS THAT TAUNTS YOU BEFORE YOU BLOW THEM UP then you should stop thinking, whack a plank into your cranium and buy this game right now! I also recommend ClapTrap's Robot Revolution. It got more weapons, even more extreme gameplay and neverending waves of Cl4pTp military."
15984,"This game rocks!!  Tons of guns, tons of fun!!"
15985,"At first, I hated Borderlands since I kept dying as Roland the Soldier, when I tried Mordecai the Hunter, now I love this game. There has been money other Role Playing Shooters like Fallout and Bioshock. But this one has a million number of arsenal to choose from, four classes, the other being Brick the Berserker and Lillith the Siren. I tend to play the multiplayer with my sister and her husband, which is much better than hearing kids blow jobbing the microphones raging.

Overall, the gameplay is great, the storyline is good, the graphic are cartoony yet awesome, and the multiplayer is good unless you find a stable connection and good players. So... SNAG IT!"
15986,"Great game, loads of content, solid gameplay, etc. etc. If you're coming back to this after playing Borderlands 2, even though this is an amazing game, you'll definitely not be as impressed, but that's just because Borderlands 2 does everything so well; successfully raising the bar in all the right ways.

Even if you have - or are going to get - Borderlands 2, I recommend getting this if you want to know the backgrounds of characters like Marcus and such a little better. The only other reason to get it would be if you want zombies (in The Island of Dr. Ned DLC), because Borderlands 2 does not have any as of the moment I am writing this. The zombie DLC is loaded with the right atmosphere and a ton of zombies. The only reason I'd ever go back to Borderlands over Borderlands 2 is to play the zombie DLC. It's good stuff."
15987,Really good fun FPS. Lots of targets to shoot at and a massive range of weapons to choose from. GFX are a bit dated but that just adds to the character of the game.
15988,"WOW, i NEVER gave this game a good shake when it was 1st released & thought it sucked cause i was into the whole ""cell shading sucks"" mentality.
I wasn't willing to spend time on it @ 1st but once i finally jumped in & gave it a whirl i found it hypnotic in a apocalyptic way.
Edit:
This game Often goes on sale for 5$ as a complete edition so it's a NO brainer if you're into a games with tonnes to do & weapons galore.
Also rocks in COOP !"
15989,"Great fun, co-op makes it better."
15990,Alot of fun playing with your friends! Great game!
15991,"Great game! Fun action and I personaly love the art-style and the style of the game in general. Tons to do if you enjoy this type of FPS/RPG hybrid.

The only bad things I have to say about this game are that it can be repetitive and if you don't love it after the first couple hours or so you probably never will. There is way more interesting things farther along but the gameplay at the basic level is the same.

Lastly the story itself is funny and slapstick but if you are looking for a quality storyline or a serious game go play something else because while borderlands is many things serious is certainly not one and the story is hardly quality literature."
15992,"Great game!  It's a time sink for sure.  Definitely pulls you in.  They changed the art style at the last minute to distinguish it from Fallout, and I definitely think it was a good choice!  Very cool."
15993,"Hey, do you wanna kill stuff? Do you wanna kill stuff with your friends? This game is relevant to your interests."
15994,"There is nothing gripping or engaging about Borderlands story, and the mechanics are a mixture of run and gun fps and rpg style gameplay, much like a faster paced Fallout 3 or New Vegas. The fun comes from the sheer off the wall gameplay, massive amount of weapons, and just gory fun that is expected from a faux post apocalyptic / steam punk universe. Multiplayer is a must for maximum enjoyment, and with up to 4 player co-op, you should never be short on death and destruction."
15995,Its FRIGGEN awesome and EVEN BETTER with multiplayer.You wont be disappointed.Batteries not included :( .
15996,This game...is awesome.
15997,Well worth $8
15998,"Although the story is pretty much shit, this game is instantly addictive for the loot-whore in me. I never get tired of playing missions and collecting new and more-awesome weapons. I wish I had someone to play co-op with, though."
15999,Funny game. Many things to discover. It;s like fallout.
16000,"It's Borderlands. Perhaps the most fun i have had in a long time - awesome characters, funny, long campaign and epic co-op action - the fps and rpg had a baby; borderlands and thats why it's so awesome! Did i mention there are way too many guns to count?"
16001,Try it Play it Love it
16002,HELL YEAH!
16003,Would highly recommend this game to people who like RPGs and FPS
16004,Borderlands hat es endlich geschafft. Ein CO-OP FPS mit Rollenspiel elementen zu versetzten das funktioniert. am anfang startet man alle ungefähr gleich aber schon bald muss man zusammen spielen und eine Taktik entwickeln. Borderlands ist TOP!
16005,YO DAWG THERE'S HELLA GUNS IN THIS BITCH
16006,This is a great game and especially great for co-op. ^^
16007,Diablo2+Left 4 Dead+Fallout 3=Borderlands
16008,"[h1] [b] ""If it took more than one shot... you weren't using a Jakobs.” [/b] [/h1]

Borderlands is a First Person Shooter with Role Playing elements, loads of gear, even more guns, bad guys, humour & carnage.

Set on Pandora, 4 Vault hunters go looking for an ancient alien civilisations vault rumoured to contain riches, frame & power.

With help from a mysterious woman (Angle) and some of the more friendly locals the Vault hunters go looking for 4 parts of the key needed to open the Vault.

Spanning several different open world environments you and up to 3 others will undertake the main quest sand have many more optional side quests to complete at your lazier, all the time having to combat the local bandits and/or wildlife.

There are 4 very different Vault hunters, all with a unique active ability and skill trees. Whilst all can use any weapons each Vault Hunter has skills related to boosting more specific types. There is a weapon proficiency ranking system, so the more you use a gun type, the better stat boots you will get, we are talking small amounts, so swapping from solely SMG’s to Assault late game won’t be a major detriment.

Guns are generated randomly and unlikely to have an identical counterpart. With revolvers, Repeater Pistols, Shotguns, SMG’s, Assault Rifles (with LMG’s variation), Sniper Rifles & Rocket Launches you will have an almost unlimited supply of weapons to choose from, also did I mention they can apply Fire, Shock & Corrosive affects to their victims, or just go off with a Explosive bang on impact as well as the boring projectile impact we are more common with. Trust me, there is nothing more satisfying than a bandit screaming “Ahhh, Mommy, Mommy!” whilst being burnt to a small pile of ash.

The enemy is varied; even throughout the bandits you have Midgets, Psychos, Normal’s (ish), Marauders & Goliaths, all armed with various weapons and all come in multiple variants.
The wildlife is even further varied with Skags, Spiderrants, Scythis, Crab Wors, Trash Feeders, Drifters & Guardians all with several types of each species, and elemental types.
Other enemies also include the likes of the Crimson Lance, Hyperion Soldiers, Zombies, Claptrap’s as well as vehicle, turrets and drones (with DLC’s), again all with several variants, and elemental types.

The Borderlands art style is unique and has a comic feel to it, there are textures to the cliff face that are held together by metal clips.

The humour is (in my opinion) only bettered by its sequel Borderlands 2. Admits the gun play, popping bandit’s heads with electrical damage or running over Spiderrants and leaving a green smear, there is barrels full of innuendoes, funny dialog, piss taking and childish jokes (not suitable for children). It’s not just thrown in there as filler, it is part of the game, the environment, the locals, from start to end it follows everything and gives a funny edge to what essentially becomes a genocide level killing spree (against morally corrupt individuals) to get personal wealth.

The dialog is in a league of its own, more for the enemy comments during battle or Boss intros.
Lines like “Nobody shoots my buddies but me!”, “I'm gonna skin ya, put on your face, and say Hi to your momma!” & “Strip the flesh, salt the wound! (maniacal laughter)” are just some of the comments that get muttered or screamed at you during combat (essentially all the time). The first several hours I wasn’t getting killed due to lack of skill or tactics, it was because I was wetting myself laughing, I never expected this kind of dialog during a shoot out. 

In all, this is a brilliant game, it has some years on it and as a first of its franchise it lacks in a few small areas (no FOV settings) compared to more current games. But with the art style, dialog and ridiculous gun variations it has stood the test of time. Throughout my 2,500h obsession with Borderlands 2 I have revisited this game a few times and still enjoy it, a lot.

[h1] Borderlands is a must play for FPS fans, 9.5/10 [/h1]"
16009,Ever wanted to get your quest on AND kick some @$$ with crazy guns? Look no further than Borderlands
16010,"pretty amazing game , just worth £30.00"
16011,"fun fps shooter, great for 4 ppl to have a hell of a time"
16012,"I like guns. Do you like guns?
yes.
I like guns that EXPLODE and SET STUFF ON FIRE. Do you like guns that EXPLODE and SET STUFF ON FIRE?
you better. 

also, this game is pretty stylish."
16013,"While I'm sure this would still be fun solo, if you've got a couple friends that like FPSs and/or Diablo-style RPGs then this is a blast."
16014,Play in the wastelands of Borderlands and look for the greatest treasure of all.
16015,"I have 60hrs logged and I still have all the DLC to beat. Great game, e specially with friends."
16016,"very fucking addicting 
"
16017,The mostest boreder lands i was ever bored in.
16018,"I find Borderlands to be an excellent FPS interwined with the best features of an RPG. 

FUCK YEAH!!!"
16019,Fun game just cant play my zombie expansion
16020,Tons and tons and tons and tone of guns so many it will make your head explode... hate the outline effect thats just my opppion though.. I removed it from a wiki tweaks for borderlands.. ah the texture work is something else by that I mean good.. must have filtering turned all the way up to enjoy them....
16021,"A great class based FPS/RPG with some fantastic visuals and dialog.  Serving suggestion: play with a couple of friends for some great times.

Also, sniping with the Double Anarchy is the best thing in the world."
16022,"This game is gonna hold you to your PC until you either finish it or power goes out

Borderlands, the game has definitely deserved the title as 2009 Game of the Year. Combining Both RPG Elements and FPS Elements, to make the first Role Playing Shooter.

For a closing statement, Borderlands is one of the most enjoyable game ever created, as long as you play it along with others. Furthermore, Borderlands is a memorable, fun, and a simply awesome game that no FPS or RPG fan should miss."
16023,8.0
16024,"You can grind by dueling and then knock the car into space while someone else is sitting in it, just like persona"
16025,I have played this from release on the xbox 360 and have yet to drop the controller but since the box is in the shop I have had to break down and get it for the computer and am yet regretting it ... This game is above ratings as there is not one gun the same as the next. Every Cromeraxx run done shows new and exciting guns to play with. Story line is extremely deep and at points very thought provoking and funny. A definate buy for any gamer who enjoys pointing a gun at an object and then blowing it to smitherines!!  Hope to see you in the Borderlands soon!
16026,Awesome! Be prepared to lose days on this game. Mad Max meets Crysis.
16027,SO FUN ESPECIALLY IN COOP >.< GREAT GRAPHICS TOO
16028,Endless fun. Seriously.
16029,"Отличная игра - смесь шутера и Diablo. Насчет сюжета ничего не скажу, а графика красивая, глаз радует(как будто все нарисованное). Огромный выбор оружия, от пистолета до лазерной пушки. Всем советую поиграть, а  лучше всего с друзьями в коопе."
16030,funlands
16031,"The most awesome fps in a long time. Play it with friends and your in for a treat. Might not be the _best_ fps out there, but you're garaunteed alot of fun."
16032,"It's like Fallout,but shootier!"
16033,"Broken too much fun...

This game is addicting it blends two of everybodies favourites, first person action with Role Playing system. 4 unique characters, uncountable number of weapons and lots of skills, a LOT of missions and even DLC for extended game time. Considering how I'm addicted with only 8 hours played so far. I highly recommend anybody to pick it up.

Ultimately Coop makes the game playable for me. As I prefer multiplayer RPG's and FPS's and this takes home the prize.

Now my only problem is managing between more than 3 other friends so that we all get to experience the awesome story and have fun. 4 player max is quite restricting.

Definitly Recommended"
16034,its fucking diablo in first person with hella much guns. so its pretty fun
16035,"One of the greatest co-op games ever made. If you're a looter then you'll love this game, it's all about loot and shoot. The story and graphics are really nice too!"
16036,Use the revolvers. the 2 shot elemental end game revolvers are top tier.
16037,"It's a bit hard to get used with, and the difficulty scaling might be very off at times, but Borderlands makes a very, very good RPG-FPS hybrid with an inventive weapon system that has kept me playing with one character for 100+ hours and counting!"
16038,One of the best games I played in my whole life.
16039,One of the best game i ever played.
16040,Great game. Shows that cell shading can be put to good use :)
16041,this game is amazing and especially if you'r a huge gun nut :) recommend the game of the year edition
16042,"This shit is fucking awesome, I can't get off it"
16043,"Игрушка просто ураган. Кооператив в разы лучше одиночной игры, так что если есть возможность - играйте с людьми. Как всегда подкачали издатели. Когда же они перестанут забивать на своих покупателей..."
16044,"Love the anime-style graphics, fun gameplay!  Mix of first person shooter and RPG."
16045,"Awesome coop game, finished it 3 times! The DLCs are great too, and each one is somewhat unique, my favorite being the Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, completely unique style and atmosphere like from a creepy horror movie throughout. Reminds me a bit of Nazi Zombies mode in Call of Duty, which is also one of my favorite games."
16046,"Amazing game. Lot's of gameplay, and IMO great replay value"
16047,An awesome Fallout 3 style Shooter
16048,"If I had to review Borderlands with 1 word that word would be: ""IFrekingLoveThisGame""
If I had to sum it up in 2 words: ""Fliping Fantastic!""
10/10 stars, Great addicting game! Replay value is also really great :D"
16049,"
"
16050,I would strongly recommend this game if you love both RPG and FPS. However its game play is not as deep as single genre games like other hybrid games.
16051,Sweet Deal Catch it while is real cheep
16052,Absolutely genius game. Incredibly fun!
16053,omfg its a bbq!!111
16054,Great for mindless co-op!
16055,Plays pretty much exactly like what you'll expect a FPS Diablo would play like: Combining good gunplay and myriad of randomly generated loot. I'm also a fan of the pretty unique art style.
16056,"for 5 bucks , well worth it! dont buy the game of the year edition, buy the normal one with the fort knox and claptrap addons!"
16057,"✓ Good graphics and special effects
✓ Decent story in an original science-fiction universe
✓ Very polished game mechanics, with randomized elements
✓ Online co-op multiplayer works well 
✓ Good weapon design and animations
✓ Good sound design and excellent soundtracks (Jesper Kyd!)
✓ Overall nice presentation and decent humour

✘ No Linux support."
16058,"This game is at least worth taking a  look at. If it goes on sale, grab it. Don't bother with the Xpacs, play through the main game first and see if you like it. If you're still hooked by the time you finish, then get the expansions. Not Moxxi's underdome or whatever though, that one sucks."
16059,"""Borderlands was a very different and unique game to play. So when I played it for the first time I had a little trouble getting used to the gameplay and therefore stopped playing for awhile. But recently a few friends invited me to play and I finally got into it. The gameplay is quite fun and unique once you get used to it. The co-op part of the game is really well done. The world is extensive and for a RPG shooter, it is very good with selection of how you want your character to be. 4.5/5"""
16060,Into the nether with heavy weapons in tow. ++ Good times await.
16061,"Awesome game to play with your friends, online or lan.  :)"
16062,"I have played this game by myself for over 100 hours and all you do is shoot things. You also have your choice of 87 bazillion guns and shields and grenades and character modifiers and special abilities like a deployable turret or attack bird-thing or going invisible or punching like a madman and you kill all kinds of aliens and drive weaponized vehicles with up to three other friends. So if that sounds cool, it's cause it is and you should play it.

MAINSTREAM'D!"
16063,"It's a simple game.. Go from point A to point B, kill everything insite, collect every weapon you can.. But it sure is a hell of a lot of fun. If you like loot-fest games like diablo and you enjoy FPS games with a slight RPG twist, this is the a great game to pick up on the cheap. You can easily sink a ton of hours with a small group of friends."
16064,You must play this game within your lifespan.
16065,Great game that mixes RPG with FPS and gives you hundreds of hours of play time.  Get the GOTY edition for $30 and it'll come with all DLC.  The DLC is absolutely worth the extra $10.
16066,"This isn't usually my type of game, but Bordelands is fantastic."
16067,"If your pc can run this game you gotta get it, and not just the standard game, I'm talking about the GOTY edition it is so worth it."
16068,"This game is Fucking Great!!!!!!!!!!!!   Gran juego, el modo online es buenisismo, mejoras de nivel, armas por doquier, cada personaje tiene su habilidad especial,  etc.."
16069,"Play it, shitpumps!"
16070,"Great FPS action game. Campaign and co-op. Not meant to be a player v. player, though there's a DLC that allows for this. Immersive theme and world development, though the storyline's not too steep. Game scales to your level for replayability. Goes through Gamespy's servers - disabiling the in-game VC and using Steam's VC recommended."
16071,"Guns, guns, and more guns! :)"
16072,Pure Co-op awesomeness.
16073,"Really fun FPS RPG, especially when playing with friends"
16074,"Really Enjoying this game. Some how I missed it in the begin. But now I am all in on the this game.  Single player is good,but when you get a few friends into the mix and you work together. Awsome Fun."
16075,"Highly recommend this, I never thought I'd replay a single player game."
16076,"Borderlands, in all, is a very impressive game. Even more impressive with added shenanigans in multiplayer (skype call optional) DLC only added to the greatness. More brilliancy comes in the form of The Secret Armory of General Knoxx. All in all, for full effect, play this in its entirety before moving on to Borderlands 2."
16077,"This game is a blast all-around. Whether it's sticking to main story of the game or doing side quests to earn extra guns/cash, this game is outright fun."
16078,terrible !!
16079,"Only played the first quarter but that was enough. While I found the game to be enjoyable, I could not finish it. Simply put, without friends the game gets boring. But, add that special mix of friends and firepower, and suddenly the game shines like a tarnished gemstone."
16080,"Borderlands is brilliant in that it is an ideal combination of humor, challenge, and RPG skillbuilding. Oh, and lots of guns."
16081,Great game! Just awesome amount of weapons and great co-op gaming!
16082,"Fun stuff. If you happen to buy it, DO NOT purchase the Mad Moxie thing. Its a peice of shit. But other that Borderlands is a pretty fun game."
16083,The gunclub.
16084,Add good RPG elements to an FPS and shazam!  Borderlands
16085,"An Amazing take on RPG, FPS and Humour packaged into one, amazing and most interesting mixture game that will have you loosing time that you thought that you had. With friends its an even more awesome and you will be ranking up quicker than you can throw that mouse against the wall because of the immense teeth shattering difficulty you could be facing the more players you have going at the same time.

The Graphics are lush, especially due to the Cell Shading effect which gives the game that jagged, old fashioned look you'd normally only find in old console games that pretend to look pretty when they arn't.

I would give this game a go, even if you arn't into Comedy based RPG shooters. However, after your third playthrough, you may perhaps loose interest. The enemies scale to your level but the missions stay the same, up the frustration factor, your in for a mad ride through hell.

Final Rating: 4 / 5"
16086,Really good dlc and a lot of fun with a few friends.
16087,"HEEYOOO!!! *Bang Bang﻿ Bang Bang* x'3 

THIS GAME IS FUCKING AWESOME!!!"
16088,"An RPG written by an honest RPer - it's all about the exp, the gratuitous kills, and the loot. Oh god, the loot. Fuck roleplaying."
16089,worth a buy
16090,Great game with lots of guns. Lots and LOTS of guns. DLC continues the fun even after you've beaten it like 5 times.
16091,one of a kind
16092,4 play co-op and skag kill'n fun! Wooooo!
16093,"Love the comic book graphic and the weapon variety, but similar to the L4D games much better game experience if you have friends to play with as you lvl up."
16094,"Fun, fun, fun! Do it!"
16095,"
Why bother buying Borderlands itself when you can buy Borderlands game of the year edition for the same price with all 4 DLC maps  that you'd probably be spending more time on anyway....?

erm... ""o_O"
16096,"Badass game. You should play it. More specifically, you should play it with your friends."
16097,"Borderlands is a terrific game, but it has a few flaws. The awesome graphical style is rather eye catching, as well as the Diablo style loot/reward system. Great enemy designs and weapon attributes are fantastic... for awhile at least. For all this title does right, it also gets a lot wrong. The NPC's and lackluster story do little to encourage you to keep playing. So after about 30 or so hours you'll have seen everything there is to see. I completed my single character to max level, but I didnt feel the need to start with a new one despite the different classes and abilities. All in all it is worth the price of admission, but Borderlands borders on boring fairly quickly. Best played with friends. 7/10"
16098,"A great RPG shooter mix.  This game really leaves an impression on you.  The vastness of Pandora, the millions of billions of weapons, the different enemies, and the good ol' cynical humor.  It's thrilling to find a weapons chest and think, ""What am I going to get here?"" It's a great feeling when you find a better assault rifle than the one you have, and the ache that you feel when you have too many weapons that you want to have in your 4 slots of weapons. To anyone who loves shooters and has a lot of time on their hands, I recommend this game."
16099,Generic Protaganists do generic things involving generic missions in a generic post apocalyptic world full of generic enemies that attack you in generic ways while you shoot them with your generic guns.
16100,"You like guns? you like shooting things?

well this game has both in vast quantites.

YOu can play as one of four classes. and in each class there are three distinct mini classes that gives you much customization.

From spraying 5 rockets at a time to sniping with lightning.

your choice."
16101,このゲームにおけるレベルの差というのは例え1レベル差があっても小学校の学年差並みに格差が広いのでお買い求めはフレンドと同時に購入・開始が望ましいです
16102,"Awesome. Think Diablo 2 as an FPS with tons of quirky movie references (Die Hard, Mad Max, etc.)."
16103,A great game to play with your buddies. Lots of fun to be had gunning down outlandish enemies with over a bajillion different guns. Pick up the GOTY Edition now for a bit of savings as well.
16104,"If the Game Of The Year edition goes on special, get it! It's a good fun Coop game."
16105,Not to bad. If you having trouble. Have me host a server. ;)
16106,"Pretty decent adventure/FPS game, great to play with friends.  The downloadable content makes up for the main storyline's lackluster conclusion."
16107,"Truly great game., if you have friends to play it with. Otherwise, It's a bit of a letdown."
16108,Diablo 2 with guns!
16109,"A little too expensive , but good and original
"
16110,its awsome
16111,"Brings the best of  FPS and RPG together, although you can play by yourself i would recommend getting some friends into playing it with you, the more people who are playing the more fun it is. The repeat value is good, once you beat the game you can start on playthrough 2 with your character from playthrough 1, the enemys are stronger and they get upgraded one step, the DLC are also scaled to whatever playhrough your on. There are 3 playthroughs i think, 1, 2 ,and 2.5. So four DLC, 3 playthroughs each one getting more difficult as you go, a FPS, RPG elements, too many guns to count, and some interesting characters with a side of humor. Come on you know you wanna play this game."
16112,"Lock and load would be the best term for Borderlands.

RPG put into a FPS game seems odd, but works out great. There's 4 classes that specialize in different weaponry and some into melee aswell. Combined with some humour, outstanding headshot graphics and 4 party network games allow for some serious fun.

(Yes, the game has rapid fire bazookas!)"
16113,You should buy this so I have more people to play it with. And brush your teeth.
16114,BORDERLANDS WE WORSHIP YOU O MIGHTY ONE ...
16115,Really fun to play multiplayer co-op campaign. Lots of cool weapons and things to shoot at. Each class is pretty unique and is fun in its own right. Would not play alone for longer than the tutorial.
16116,"If you have 1-3 friends that already own this game do yourself a favour and get it as well and make sure you all hook up for the playing. 
Put straight, this one is amongst my all-time favourites for online co-op play. Extremely fun, extremely addicting thanks to scavenging/upgrading a la Diablo.
The cell shader graphics style may be deemed by some as a cop-out move in order to cover up for development failure but in my opinion it is not so. Back when this game released the kind of graphics style was unique enough to actually make the game stand out amongst the masses of other shooter game competition of that time - and it *does* deliver in the graphics department thanks to a good passion for detail.
On top of all that (and of course this one's highly personal!) the particular sense of humour displayed throughout the game appealed to me."
16117,"
"
16118,"My First impression of this game for me was bad but i quickly learned never judge a book by its cover. Its really a game that grows onto you. With FPS and RPG elements i got hooked real quick since FPS is my favourite genre with RPGs a close second. With its diablo ""shoot & slash"" style gameplay its great fun and dangerously addicative. With addition of co-op granting better rewards and experience. Id highly recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS's and RPG's."
16119,"Good game, lots of fun. Better if you have freinds to play it with. Solo play can just get boring. Expansions are nice, but so short. :("
16120,"This game put RPG / FPS on the map. Great gameplay keeps you focused on lusting after items and pushing onward to the next level. The netplay is implemented fairly well, although the in-game voice is rather terrible. The interface also shows signs of being a port over from consoles vs. tuned for PC controlls (like mouse wheel scrolling through menus). The storyline could use some work, but it doens't get in the way of just enjoying the cool atmosphere, cool guns, and battles along the way."
16121,Fucking win...
16122,"Ah, Borderlands. Fantastic RPG-like co-op shooter. Don't get stuck on the story, just follow the waypoints, upgrade your skills, and kill things. Fun vehicle action as well. Highly recommend."
16123,"A fun shooter. And the graphics makes it all worth it.
But play co-op, doesn't matter if its 1 or 3, it makes everything funnier."
16124,Easy and addicting. I've played through with my friends and solo and it's still fun to find weapons and try new builds. I have one of each character and I don't think I'll be done with this game until I've played through each of them at least once. I think its the variety which makes this game.
16125,This game is great for the first time around. I have heard of people doing many playthroughs. I got through one and was done. It doesnt feel unique and will get quite boring as you do the same thing over and over...
16126,a really good game fun to play and vicius
16127,"It's an RPG/Shoot-'em-up, but it's got the whole mob grinding and weapon replacement thing from RPGs.

Best served with an extra helping of friends.
"
16128,Must have.
16129,"Good old fashion gaming fun.  Who cares about story and extra ""modes"" when the game play is fun?  This game is all about having fun FPS gameplay, collecting guns, and getting tougher.  I put 50 hours into this game and enjoyed it, but I do wish the mutiplayer aspect was easier to get going with friends or coop.  I recomend this if you like FPS games and you like Diablo 2."
16130,"loads of fun.

wicked criticals :D"
16131,The most boring game ever made.
16132,"Borderlands is a zanny FPS from Gearbox Studios; one that has only truly improved with DLC and patches. Play as one of four classes: Mordecai (Hunter), Lilith (Siren), Roland (Soldier), and Brick (Beserker). While the classes aren't exactly balanced, they work well together - and the point of the game isn't who can do better. Team work is required, more so with 4 players. Picture it as a sort of FPS-Diablo; for that is what it is. There is a storyline, but you aren't here for that. You want and are here for the loot, and you can't (well, you can; but it isn't as good) get it by yourself. With a clever use of upgrades and weaponry, you can make the class combination of your dreams; and become a group of mercenaries Pandora won't soon forget."
16133,"Story is near to non-existent, but its still really fun and the co-op is cool. Grahpics are also pretty cool. I'd certainly say its worth it."
16134,"It's what you think, but with cuter robots."
16135,"A good fun shooter but lacks variety with enemies and the final few missions drag on for far, far too long. Plenty of content and weapons and it has a great co-op mode."
16136,Mah sniper rifle goes PEW PEW
16137,shoot shit get loot n shit whatev f it im out peace
16138,"Damn fun to play with friends, but very boring to play alone."
16139,It isn't a game for everyone but maybe you like it!
16140,"A really fun game to play with friends, and the art style is simple but sexy.
The only problem I have with the game is that running back and forth to do all the many many quests can just get tedious.

Otherwise definitely worth playing."
16141,"If your the sort of person that buys a 200 dollar mouse to help make your twitch headshots slightly more efficent, memorize maps to get a second faster response then the other players, and measure your actions per minute on a korean scale, borderlands isnt for you. However if you enjoy blowing stuff up, diablo style loot, a large dash of humor in a game, and in general shooting everyrthing that moves...borderlands is perfect!"
16142,"Humorous, filled with adventure, and guns galore. This game is meant to be played and enjoyed to the fullest."
16143,A fantastic game. It graphics are different and add thier own special magic. The story and characters are funny and never get old. The skill trees are not fiddly and it is very easy to mess around with. Collecting guns and testing them out over and over never gets old when you have a couple of pals around to play it with. It is definitely one of those games you need to play with 3 other people.
16144,Good co-op shooter but felt let down by the ending.
16145,"Seamlessly blends RPG and FPS genres. Lots of fun, plenty of humorous writing. Random weapon generation gives Borderlands tremendous replay value."
16146,One of my favorite 1st person shooters ever!!! GREAT GAME!!
16147,C'est juste trop trop fun ce jeux :) et il y a tout le temps un truc à faire on s'ennuie jamais^^
16148,":D
...And I need friends to play with =("
16149,"Very addictive!  If you look into this game, get the GOTY Edition, as the expansion packs add tons of replay value.  And between the extra challenges that present themselves when you start a new game after beating it the first time to the multiplayer aspect, Borderlands has a lot to offer."
16150,"Come with me on a journey, a journey where you leave this plane of existence and enter a new one. One where you are promised endless hours of joy gained from limitless combinations of instruments of death that you will acquire by using previous death instruments to instrumentally grant your enemies, or the nearest flea ridden small animal, death. Now imagine this place is described to you as endless. Anywhere you can see, you can go. The world is yours and you are its. Seamlessly you fit yourself into it and become one with it. Truly magnificent, but thats not all! Also this world promises you a compelling narrative and lifetimes worth of enjoyment.


This world does not exist, and this game does not even border on the land in which it is found."
16151,The studio's CEO said the PC version was being made specifically for the PC and wouldn't be a shitty port.  He lied.  AFAIK most of the major game breaking bugs have not been fixed.  When the game works it's pretty fun.  It would be a lot of fun with 3 other people but even then it's probably not worth buying.
16152,I can't get enough of this game. It's Scrag-tastic !
16153,The Pwnage
16154,"""Hey, Hey, I pooped right where you're standing"" - Claptrap 10 out of 10"
16155,68/100
16156,My favorite game.  Own a copy here on steam and on xbox.  Totally worth the money tenfold.
16157,"So the FPS and RPG had a baby. It was called the Role-Playing Shooter. You know what, I'm not even gonna write a thorough recommendation. All I'm gonna say is: It's Borderlands. Look at the trailer, screenshots whatever, BUY IT. While you're at it, buy the all the DLC for the game too."
16158,"FODASTICO!!!! RPS (Role Playing Shooter ou RPG + FPS) MUITO BOM!!! jogabilidade otima.... nivel de dificuldade desafiador! tive varias horas de entretenimento com esse jogo... recomendo :D

16159,Awesome Game! Anyone into FPS with a hint of RPG will enjoy this game.
16160,"If you really want an immersive and time consuming co-op game that's just as fun to play in single player, than Borderlands is it. The artistic style that Gearbox produced from the Unreal Engine 3 is spectaular and it makes the game's unique design seem even more impressive.

The four DLC's each add hours of gameplay to the main story line and allow Borderlands to have replayability for a very long time."
16161,BUY IT !
16162,It´s just Borderlands best Game ever.
16163,"if you don't own this game, you're a communist"
16164,"Awesome game, but hard as hell if you're going at it alone."
16165,Extremely fun. Polished.  Unique. Beautiful. Repetitive. Better with friends. Unsatisfying ending.
16166,Type of game that you'll play obsessively for 50 hours over the course of 10 days then get sick of.  Well actually I want to play it again but my character erased and the 12 gig installation isn't very friendly.  =(
16167,Best FPSRPG with cel-shaded graphics and funny gameplay. (Is there any other game with these features?)
16168,"IT'S AWESOME! BLOOD, VIOLENCE AND GORE! BEST GAME EVER! PLAY!

Years later this game is STILL fun to come back to! STILL BEST GAME EVER! PLAY!"
16169,"Amazing game.  Way fun!  The RPG elements are a big draw, and really make playing all the more enjoyable!"
16170,"Well written and completely insane.  Just watch out if you want to play it mul,tiplayer.  The save is based on whoever you play online with that got furthest.  You can actually miss missions that way.  I learned this the Hard way, but it's a fun game with lots of weapons and decent variety for a shooter."
16171,You.  Need.  This.  Game.  NOW.
16172,"Great music, atmosphere, humour and artistic style, just bit of a chore to get to work - half assed console ports for you. But once you have it fixed up for PC it's great fun with friends."
16173,"The most fun you can ever have in a video game with 4 close bros. Skip the Moxxi DLC, go straight to General Knoxx. Have fun!"
16174,"I was pleasantly surprised by this. I thought I'd be turned off by everything being cartoonish, but I honestly don't even really notice. Quests, fighting, loot. Fun game that gives you lots of hours of play."
16175,"Good gun feel, good sound/music, lots of loot, great co-op, dreary characters and depressing wasteland. There's a fair variety of enemies but rather basic AI. Easy to beat first time through but worthwhile.  Update: Certain aspects are actually better than Borderlands 2.  The different gun brands are unique, but don't have stupidity added to make them MORE unique as in the sequel...
Overall 8.4"
16176,"this game is decent I give it some props. Game play is like Parasite Eve meets RE but slow action. that is bad, but the rest feels okay. not sure how much time I will designate to this game but it will grow a bit on me i am sure, thanks!!!  The Gift wasn't a waste that is for sure.  I got some fair time in it.  it would rank higher if ir was hard"
16177,"Awsome game, funny !"
16178,"i really like this game, single player is awesome but if you have friends to play is better.
"
16179,Awesome! One of my favorite games.
16180,"You like gun porn? Here it is!
Guns in Borderlands are randomly generated, essetially giving you an endless supply, and the constant chance of finding something better. That's about  it's major strength though. Its co-op is fun if you're lucky enough to have a build that it will function on, and expect to spend some time getting your mic functioning. Also, it becomes difficult in the later stages to play more than one character at the same time, who uses the same ammo type. Good fun, and the orginal style of animation certainly warrants a look if nothing else."
16181,"Borderlands. Borderlands is like Marmite, you either love it or you hate it. I personally enjoy the RPG elements of Borderlands along with the beautifully rendered graphics and interesting storyline. The amount of weapons is crazy, you can literally never find the same weapon twice (unless it's a quest-related weapon, duh) which is good for people who constantly find themselves bored of using the same weapon. I recommand you buy Borderlands if you enjoy the wacky cartoony side of games."
16182,Hours upon hours of replay value here.
16183,Awesome Game! RPGFPS Awsomeness from start to end.
16184,awesome game
16185,It's really hard to describe the obscene level of fun this game is with a couple friends.
16186,"Great, goofy fun.... If you have buddies to play it with. As a single-player game, it get's repetitive fairly quick in terms of actual gameplay mechanics, but the loot system will keep bringing you back."
16187,"The best RPG/FPS hybrid i have ever played!

Great fun, if not a little light on content (without the DLC) i think this is an all round winner 

(check for a GOYE and possibly nab some DLC with it though)"
16188,"A fun shooter-RPG mixup with a bit repetitive quest system and relatively small and a bit too linear maps. Playing with some friends is one of the best multiplayer experience, I only recommend playing it that way."
16189,Excellent Co-Op fun.
16190,"ชอบภาพในเกมอ่ะ แปลกตาไปอีกแบบ แต่ไม่ชอบระบบ online ที่มักจะกระตุกเสมอ

ยิงไป 10 กว่านัดแล้ว เพิ่งจะเห็นว่าศัตรูตาย T^T ส่วนตัวให้คะแนน 6/10"
16191,"This is an awesome, addictive, extensive shooter with enough RPG elements to keep many completionists busy!  Easy to pick up (they have a good in-game introduction), and not too hard to master, with plenty of replayability!"
16192,"A Role Playing Game with the vantage point of a Firsp Person Shooter. A Role Playing Shooter. All put together in a unique art style that is cel shading. Add in some humour and you get a great game.

Once you completed the main game, you can start again, keep your gear, and the enemies will be harder this time round as they will be matched to your level.

If that's not enough, there is the Downloadable Content (DLC) or expansion packs.

Mad Moxxi's Underdome is more for multiplayer and as such not popular, although it uses a bank so you can store equipment. So for that feature alone, I think that's a great reason to get that one 540MB plus the main game

Zombie Island of Dr. Ned is a fun Zombie map, if a little short. 1.1GB plus the main game

Secret Armoury of General Knoxx takes up the levelling to 69, probably the favourite DLC 2.06GB plus the main game

ClapTraps Robolution is fun, loads of ClapTraps to take down and shoot, they almost seem to come out of nowhere. 1.61GB worth"
16193,With all the expansions easily more content for the money than 99% of other games. Tonz of fun both single/multiplayer. Claptraps will make u laugh every time.
16194,"Incredibly funny game with lots of great easter eggs to find (and unlock). Multiplayer is a bit lacking, though incredibly fun if and when you can get a decent game going. Just remember to stock up on ammo."
16195,"This game totally rocks.  I played the holy living chit out of this game.  Total deal to get the game and all addons for < 30.  If you get it, let me know and I will def co-op with you and provide special weapons for you too."
16196,"The first proper hybrid of First Person Shooter and Role Playing Game, and it was almost perfectly created. The FPS gameplay merged well with the RPG side of the things, and the humour and overall design of the game was perfect.

A slight letdown in how the story was relayed to the player, but an otherwise good game."
16197,"Good art style, this game is all about the guns though. Plays best with friends.
Sometimes the game world doesn't have enough going for it on it's own"
16198,"Quando fui jogar Borderlands, acabei lendo em algum site de jogos que se tratava de uma mistura de FPS com RPG. Bom, tem sim um sistema de distribuir um único ponto de Skil que você ganha ao passar de level e também o sistema de quest, que é bem parecido com a dos clássicos jogos de RPG, no estilo: Pegue a quest, faça a quest, volte para terminar a quest, sem falar que encontramos quatro personagens bem diferentes e com habilidades distintas.
A história é um pouco confusa no início, mas acaba sendo explicada melhor posteriormente no jogo. Não que a história seja ruim, mas ela também não apresenta nada de novo.
O forte neste jogo é a possibilidade de jogar a campanha no modo Coop, com até 4 jogadores. Isso dá ao jogo um fator replay muito grande.
Com uma grande variedade de armas e com cenários bem trabalhados em Cellshading, faz deste jogo um bom FPS e uma boa pedida para aqueles que curtem jogar com os amigos.

Nota: 9.0/10.0

16200,"Mad Max would be thrilled to be in this one :D. Imagine a post-apocalyptic world with ... wait, you will think it's just another game with a post-apocalyptic scenario, well it is, but it's something about this one ... you just have to meet Madamme Moxxi and her underdome and you will understand. For better experience play it with friends in coop. 10/10"
16201,"Hide yo kids, hide yo wives, and hide yo husbands. Because Borderlands is absolutely awesome!"
16202,Great for a group of friends to spend a good amount of time incurring untold damage on the inhabitants of Pandora.
16203,"Story sucks, gameplay is unoriginal, and despite boasting over a billion different guns, I didn't really find each piece of artillery too much different from the last. But, by no means does this game suck. While everything about it is almost uninspired, it's still a fun game, especially if you're playing it with your friends. I can most certainly see the appeal to people who love collecting. With over a billion guns and dozens of character modifications, the goal of having the best of everything will always be there.  And even if you don't strive to be a perfectionist, the shooting is always fun. The graphics are nice to look at (again, UE3 is the best) and the game provides some humor, so it isn't too boring. It's probably a game I'd recommend if you have nothing else to play.

Grade: B-"
16204,i't a good game you all :)
16205,The hunt is superb especially with so many alternatives of guns
16206,Fun Game!
16207,"เป็นอีก 1 เกมที่หลายฝ่ายต่างบอกว่าดี แต่สำหรับผมมันแย่มาก เกมทำมาเน้นการเล่นออนไลน์มากไป สำหรับผมผู้ที่ไม่ชอบออนไลน์ ทำให้ไม่ชอบเกมนี้ไปเลย เพราะโหมดเล่นคนเดียวมันน่าเบื่อหนาย เหงาหงอย จะหลับ แต่ถ้าท่านเล่นออนไลน์อาจจะชอบมัน
กราฟฟิค - เป็นภาพแบบการ์ตูน สวย แต่กินเสป็คหน่อย เครื่องที่ใช้ กลาง-เกือบสูง

16208,Yes
16209,"Borderlands = Diablo II in FPS style. Here works sentence.. One more quest and I'll go to bed... perfectly! Singleplayer is great, but co-op multiplayer is much better. The game is neverending story after more than 30 hours (without DLCs). Also graphic and whole gameplay are on high level. This game is fun, sorry... FUN!

REVIEW - 85 %"
16210,This game is the best FPS I have ever played with what feels like infinite guns. It has a good storyline and all in all is a great game.
16211,"I would be saying this game is horrible but as it is co-op it gets a free ride into my recommendations. You spend most of the main game running or driving through a empty land full of badly drawn rock textures, killing the same few enemies over and over again. However the basic RPG elements work well if you play start to finish with the same few friends because you level up together, trade a lot, give advice and generally talk about anything through the slow parts."
16212,"This game is awesome, i've spent hours playing it and i hope i'll spend more, one word to discribe the game: GREAT. That's it"
16213,"A fun, addictive FPSRPG till the end. Worth the DLC, highly recommended."
16214,"This game takes it's self so un-seriously, that it's seriously cool."
16215,Pure awesomesauce.
16216,"I recommend it if you don't mind the repetitiveness, but if you do, this game is not for you. -By Shakeno xD"
16217,One of the most unque and fun FPS games I've ever played.
16218,FUN.
16219,"Great game, I'd say the games a cross bread of an RPG shooter like Fallout  with the co-op 4 player play style of  Left for Dead. The graphics may not appeal to all people though the artistic theme in the game is amazing. Well worth buying when on special offer."
16220,"Never ending shooter, jump in!"
16221,"A very good game, many, many hours in and just keeps me coming back."
16222,"After a couple of hours of playtime....
Great game!"
16223,Game is pretty awesome
16224,best game i played in  a long long time
16225,"This game is made of pure win. RPG shooters are he best thing on the planet. If you don't have it, GET IT NOW."
16226,"Tried it and found it to be a complete rip-off of the Diablo series with a Fallout II style. The only thing original about this game are some of the characters and the stylized graphics engine. Even though it is a rip-off, borderlands does it decently well. Playing by yourself is completely boring, which is sad since the opposite is true for Diablo. So if you are gonna play Borderlands be ready to go online with friends."
16227,"I dunno what it is about games with monotonous grindin' and lootin' but I always pour hundreds of hours into them. This game is even better because it has a girl with tight buns who can turn into a ghost made of eletricity, and run through 10 guys fast enough to turn around in time to watch their half-melted heads explode."
16228,"Some sort of FPS Diablo.  The gameplay is tight, though.  Worth picking up."
16229,"What do you get when you mix Fallout 3 with Diablo 2, Bioshock,  Halo: Combat Evolved, Sidrovich from S.T.A.L.K.E.R, and a crazy little robot who is 2 parts WALL-E and 1 part GIR? This awesome fuckin thing. Also the DLC contains werewolves and zombies."
16230,"If you've got a beefy enough machine to run this game, its well worth the play.  FPS gameplay with a Diablo-esque weapon system.  Gain levels, get gear, do missions, ect.  Fun and not to expensive as far as games go."
16231,"Awesome game. I have beaten it 9 times. 3 times as Brick and 2 times as each other character. There are certainly some flaws with the game and the multiplayer is underwhelming. All of that aside, the game is great."
16232,"I am so loving this game.  It's like a FPS mixed with a RPG.  The guns are fun, the class system is nice, the quest system is neat, it's like a single player first person shooter MMORPG.  Although, you can play it multiplayer.  (Through gamespy, which sucks, should add steam multiplayer support.)  I really love Clap-Trap (I'm dancing, I'm dancing!  Am I leaking?) and the weird artwork that look like cell shading."
16233,"Awesome with friends. Okay with public. Somewhat entertaining alone.
9/10"
16234,tons and tons of fun on multiplayer
16235,"Very stylish graphics,many items and weapons,4 classes with their own upgrades,very good 4 player co-op."
16236,It's paper mario meets the wild west. This game sucks.
16237,"Borderlands is about as much as we could hope for in an FPS/RPG in this generation. I still want a new System Shock 2 (FUUUUUUUUUUU Bioshock) but this will have to do in the mean time. It doesn't let the stats get in the way of shooting things which, due to the random nature of your guns, is really satisfying. Dudes will melt if you have gun with acidic attributes and be set on fire if you've got a fire one and so on. I would've liked having armour and other bits and bobs but as it goes its not that bad. The story is shit (especially that ending. Man.) but there's enough in here to keep you occupied for a while. It also feels like, after the first few fully fleshed out zones, that the last couple of zones aren't up to scratch. They're little more than a linear path to the end. If you can, grab Armoury of General Knoxx. It ups the level cap and, aside from egregious travelling back and forth to pad for length, is well done and has some awesome characters. Also, try and play co-op."
16238,The General Knoxx dlc for this game is the only thing that makes it worth playing.
16239,"Ive played this game a lot.
In the beginning I waited for 3 years after first hearing about its development. It eventually got released. Absolutely blew me away :D

get the dlcs tho, your online experience will suffer if u dont ~ and make sure you have actual friends to play with, pubbing it is a nono with this one."
16240,best mmo freeroam game w/ free dlc
16241,"Some glitches and hold overs from it being ported from the console, but I still like this game.

Randomly spawned guns, and tons of guys to shoot in the face. I just wish it was harder. I still have poured a ton of hours into this game; its my own little crack fix."
16242,best game FPS and RPG
16243,Juste énorme ^^
16244,A bit hilarious for dogs
16245,"Well at first i bought this game when it had just come out on the 360 and soon returned it cause it doesn't have near 100 bazillion guns, but then i saw it on steam and i never played the dlc so i wanted to play that then i just started to play and now im really hooked especial since the mp on PC."
16246,A fun online FPS with light RPS elements.
16247,"Although I haven't been able to play this since summer of '10, because my last laptop, with an ATI graphics card (decent to play), died on me (and was vista), my new computer isn't compatiable, graphics card wise. It will not work with intel (which should avoid getting for gaming), can't get past the character select.

However, I had a BLAST playing this. Personally, I find it suitible soloing than in multiplayer, but that's just me. It's fun, it's one of the rarest unique games I've ever played AND seen. If you pay attention to the storyline, you'll be amazed too.

I have not tried out the add-ons, wish I could right now.

I really recommend it for the creativity, the storyline, the gameplay, for hard time gamers, and for mature players. One of a kind game FPS game.

16248,"Graficos novedosos y muchas horas de juego, lastima que tiene limite de lvl pero posee varios personajes con habilidades distintas."
16249,Truly a modern classic. Class based skill tree driven hardcore shooter RPG.
16250,A great game by itself or with its DLCs. The ending of the game's story was terribly weak but the gameplay generally makes up for it. Do be sure to try to play the multiplayer campaign with your friends for the most fun possible.
16251,"It's best to think of Borderlands as a parody of an FPS game with elements of Diablo or similar RPGs which involve several hundred items which are randomly placed as ""loot"" throughout the game, each of these items randomly generated based upon a number of stats, perks, and so forth. Four different characters (different only in appearance and what their special attack does), plenty of areas to explore. Good game, but it MUST be understood that it definitely doesn't take itself seriously (so don't take IT seriously). Enemies include flaming midgets armed with hatchets, various insects, ghosts, and round-of-the-mill thugs and most friendly NPCs are odd characters to say the least, usually adhereing to some sort of cliche' (the incompetent doctor, the cranky old man, etc). Still, I had fun. Catch this game on sale if you can (not sure if it's *quite* worth retail price). The Zombie and General Knox DLCs are great and add plenty to the game, whereas the other two DLC are just for fun."
16252,Real fun game in small doses.  Definitely worth a run through in co-op mode.
16253,"Weapons, interesting graphics, zombies, and insane boss fights appeal to you, imagine multiplying that by 100 and adding SHIT LOADS of fun then this is the thing you get. Also there's coop."
16254,"Aw yeah... good stuff. The soundtrack hooked me, and the gameplay kept me in it to win it!"
16255,tolles game kaufen ist empfhelenswert
16256,find stuff kill stuff sell stuff with your friends or alone either way this game is a must have for rpg and shooters lovers alike
16257,"Comic style, shooty......die you psycho midget game"
16258,Great game to play as CO OP! love it
16259,"Its worth 1 playthrough, i quit after that."
16260,Is good! Can get a bit repatative if you play it too much but for the most part it's good and certinally worth the price - if you see this on deal - BUY IT!
16261,This Is possibly one of the best games (considering you enjoy multiplayer rpg's that involves lots of guns and explosions) out on steam right now and guess what its on sale!!!
16262,"Beats Fallout by a mile, not because of it's creativity but because of the layout, the awesome use of cell-shadedness, and everything in between!"
16263,"
"
16264,"Ridiculously awesome, so much to do and so many guns! Love it."
16265,This is close to being the perfect game.
16266,Solid co-op game.
16267,"I can describe this in a really short way: Diablo 2 FPS. :)
Buy it, but only if you have some friends to play with. It feels dead and deserted if you play it alone. Anyways, it's a great game."
16268,Amazing game with a good sense of humor.  The RPG elements are well done and the FPS gameplay is top notch.  Hard at some points and fun at all.
16269,"It's a first person shooter, and an RPG - in one.  Level up, shoot bad guys, drive cars, upgrade your weapons.  You gain unique abilities early on in the game, and hone them as you continue to play.  Weapons are completely random - it's fairly normal to find a shotgun that shoots fire, for example.  Fun as hell, single-player or co-op.  The DLCs are worth getting, but the game itself will keep you occupied for a while."
16270,Fun coop FPS with MMO-style missions and upgrades.  Plays kinda like a sandboxy version of Left 4 Dead with more structure and the addition of vehicle combat.  Enjoy it with friends.
16271,"Days of fun as you try to beat the game, get the best weapons, and battle your buddies in this awesome game. Also, with all the cheap DLC they are releasing, you get even more hours of fun."
16272,"When you need to blow some heads, this is the game for you!"
16273,"Anyone who compares this game to Fallout 3 is missing the point.  This game is more like the original Diablo with guns (and instead of demons you have bandits and wild creatures).  It has literally millions of guns to find, crazy enemies to destroy with said guns, and a sense of style that makes the whole experience more fun than the sum of its parts.  Play with some friends, dive in, and hunt for loot!"
16274,Very enjoyable.
16275,Great multiplayer adventure and tons of weapons. There are literally millions of different guns.
16276,"Beautiful game, funny humor, awesome combat, and challenging missions. Imagine Diablo 2 with guns and style. The biggest downside is that this game has a fail multiplayer system on the PC. If you have friends to co-op with, definite buy."
16277,"I've heard a lot of people tell me that Borderlands is like Diablo only with guns instead of swords and giant horrible aliens instead of dragons. But that just makes me wonder what the difference between an alien and a dragon is. A dragon is like a dinosaur with wings that breathes fire, right? But there's nothing on Earth like that, so dragons are obviously aliens. So if I fight aliens, I'm really just doing a really fucking awful job making first contact with extra-terrestrial life. Captain Picard would give me a stern look and probably say something like, ""The United Federation of Planets' guiding principle is the Prime Directive, blah blah blah,"" but I wouldn't really be listening because I'd be staring into his glinting hazel eyes and imagining what it would feel like to be waxing his head like a pig's back. That man exudes diplomacy from his every orifice. Dragons might try to kill him, but he'd just say something in dragon like ""Shaka, when the walls fell"" and that's that."
16278,"""Hey, you the one buying all thoes games when Steam has a promo? This game is more busted than my momma's girl parts. Why don't you take a poke at it? The uh, game, not my mom. Hot dog down a Skag den, know what I'm sayin'?"""
16279,Fantastic way to waste some time :)
16280,"Good time-killer...
Like Diablo in the past, you can play 15 minutes or a few hours..."
16281,"This is my favorite game of 2009 and I haven't enjoyed one more than it in 2010 either.  This is a huge feat considering I'm not  a huge FPS fan and there are many I don't like or play for long at all.  
If you've put off trying this game do it now and get the GOTY version with all the extras.  I've bought them all myself as I can't get enough content for Borderlands.  I can't wait for the sequel or more DLC, bring it on.  If you get and want to play Mad Moxxi with me let me know as I'll jump in and join ya - it's the only one I haven't finished as it really requires multiple players (and does take forever), it's the worse of the addons but I got it on sale and it was worth the dirt cheap price I paid."
16282,"Awesome game that I have pumped what seems be to more then 70 hours into.  Fantastic co-op (if you get a good host with mates), randomised weapons so you never know what new guns you might find, combat is nice as you always want to kill more and more bad guys with your own special guns.

If you are a fan of co-op games and got mates who have it (or will have it), this is a great game to pick up.  Instead of picking up just the base game, get the game of the year which has all the DLC that is worth the extra money.

Had great times with this game and I'm sure you would too."
16283,"First person Diablo with guns. Great Co-op play. Repeatable main quest, scaleable enimes and loot, and lite but humorous story."
16284,"Good single-player campaign, but where it really shines is in the crazy guns and frantic 4 player co-op"
16285,That multiplayer game with a couple of good guns and a lot of terrible guns that are just there to get in your way. Also repititive AI and terrible multiplayer quest management. Not sure if it's worth any money.
16286,If you love shooting and looting this game is for you.
16287,"Surprisingly Addictive (and I've been burnt out on loot and grinds).  Although single is fun, NEEDS to be played with friends for the most carnage possible."
16288,"This game is fun if you have at least one friend playing with you. Otherwise I wouldn't bother. Some people may compare this to diablo but this game's replayablitiy is incredibly limited and its main storyline is incredibly weak. Overall I'd give it a 2.5 out of 5. Its definitely a fun playthrough the first time but there is virtually no climax and you're left feeling like you've wasted your time.

But hey, until you get to the end its great!"
16289,"This game is really great if your looking for a First Person Shooter that is an RPG, the Graphics are really cool and the gameplay is really neat."
16290,"Sweet solo player, Kick ass Bro Mode. Epic Story line, Main story line ends rather anti climaticlly but still worth it with the bro mode."
16291,"The FPS and RPG quite literally had a baby in the form of Borderlands. If you're in to either genre, give it a try!"
16292,THE BEST CO-OP GAME OF THE 21ST CENTURY RIGHT HERE
16293,"great game if your system can run it, lots of adventure with a very twisted set of characters"
16294,Fun time sink!
16295,ive played this game every month since launch night.
16296,nice rpg shooter:)
16297,Addictive game..
16298,"One of the best and funniest RPGs I've ever played. Excellent graphical style, great missions. Love it. Will be playing for a while yet."
16299,"One of the best RPGs ever.  With up to 4 player co op, this game is just so much fun.  I absolutely loved it.  And the DLC is great, except the UnderDome expansion.  That was crap.    Beautiful graphics and tons of weapons.  An absolute must have for any fan of FPS or RPGs.  10/10"
16300,Brilliant game especially the co-op
16301,Nice Game and funny
16302,"If you enjoy FPS or RPG style games Borderlands is a great choice as it combines the two in a unique and funtional style. The FPS controls work very well and incorperate the RPG elements smoothly into the combat. The RPG elements in the game also cause this to be a great loot game. If you enjoy constantly upgradeing and finding better gear then this game is a good choice as the randomization of the loot (rangeing from stats to simply different weapon design) cause the loot to always leave an opening for improvement.

On the downside the story is lacking and there are a few minor bugs but this doesn't effect the gameplay and can be ignored overall.

I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys FPS or RPG. But if you can get the Game of the Year edition as it comes with the DLC which as a whole double the playtime of the game while giving you opportunities to upgrade your gear and weaponry to a new level."
16303,A good game if you're looking for a gear-gatherer and timesink. It's basically Diablo with guns.
16304,"Guns, Lots of Guns!
Story is so-so, but gameplay is good. 
Wander in Pandora is really a enjoying thing.
And Claptrap is really cute!

16305,Diablo + mad max = awesome
16306,"Mindless violence, great co-op and guns ... lots of guns."
16307,Excellent game with good replay value. Can be a little dull in single player but the coop is quite fun.
16308,Probably the best game I have played this year.  Tons of content and the mix of FPS and RPG works well.  I highly recomend this to anyone who is a fan of FPS or RPG games.
16309,"like glass! smooth. I followed the game for years before it came out played it in alpha before it was cell shade, and they were still trying to get funding. Was not sure I would like the cartoon (cell shade) look of it and delayed purchase because that alone. In the end I did buy it and ended up loving it, once I got use to the colors!
I have gone back to play it after BL2 and the gameplay is very slow to start and seem limited was not a game breaker but kinda a drag after playing 2 meening toon movements and actions. Story is still awesome start to finish and a whole lot of fun."
16310,This game is awesome!!!!
16311,This game is a great RPG shooter. There is a great design for the artstyle in how this game is played. Also there are so many different types of weapons and interesting Classes and Talent Trees added to it.  In a sense it follows similiarities to World of Warcraft but a shooting type of game instead.  Well worth playing and great for Co-op games.
16312,Killing scaggs is the bomb!
16313,Good fun gaming for you and some buddies. Story optional.
16314,"A fast-paced, fun, frenetic shooter. The coop team play is pretty damn good too and the soundtrack is awesome."
16315,Great multiplayer action. Lite on the RPG but quirky sense of humour and cool art style make for an atmospheric world. Not enough challenge.
16316,penis
16317,"If you like loot, you will love borderlands"
16318,Awesome game - definately worth looking at...will keep you coming back for more.
16319,I love this game. It is awesome. Everyone should get it!
16320,i recommend this game to be played as well as team fortress 2
16321,An amazing and fun RPG-Lite FPS with a high replay factor.
16322,"Pretty awesome game, havent got to try co-op but I had a blast with this game.  Played none stop for about 3 days when I first got it"
16323,If your looking for a good co-op game try this.
16324,"Amazing Game, but make sure you have a friend or two to play multiplayer with or it gets fairly repetitive, fast."
16325,"Very addicting co-op play, LOVE IT!"
16326,"First person shooters and hack and slash RPG's had a baby, its name is Borderlands!"
16327,"Get it people. 
The most fun I've had playing a co-op game in a while."
16328,Awesome.
16329,"One of, if not the absolute best, original first-person shooters in many years. The game is equally engaging both in single player and in multi-player, which is no small feat in an era where single player is simply treated like an addendum to most shooters. The world, while sparesly populated, feels alive. The desolate world of Pandora is compelling, and simply beating the story objectives is not wholly satisfying. You will find yourself beating optional objective after optional objective, just to spend more time amongst the inhabitants, repair one more broken claptrap or embark upon just one more useless fetch quest. After all, you'll want all the skill points you can muster to level up your character. The difficulty level curves quite high near the end of the game, and you'll need everything you can get your hands on to survive it on your own -- and once you do, you can play through again and again with increased difficulty each time. Highly recommended!"
16330,"It is best described as the bastard child of Diablo's items galore and MW2's FPS action gameplay. It is indeed a very capable shooter but it also includes four diffirent classes, leveling up, distribution of points and collecting things with stats on. Heck, it even has driving. Has a strangely enjoyable graphical style. - 5/5"
16331,It's a neverending fun & killing spree + the loot...
16332,"Incredible time waster, well worth the money.  Buy this game!"
16333,Possibly the best game I've ever played.  There are so many guns and fighting styles to choose from... and it's not too much like an RPG.  More like an FPS with actual goals to fulfill.  And the music is so cool I would sometimes just leave it on while washing dishes or cleaning house.  ^^
16334,Epic!
16335,A awesome addition to the FPS-RPG genre.
16336,amazing game.
16337,"The original is easily one of my all time favorite games.  Although it won't appeal to everyone, this is one of the best games value-wise (price vs. played hours) that I have played. 1620.5 hours in the game so far, and I'll let you figure the value."
16338,Probably the best FPS I've played in years. Essentially a first person Diablo set in a Fallout-crossed-with-rednecks style universe. Really well made.
16339,"Borderlands is fun. It's not a great game but it's well worth playing. The ""story"" was pretty disappointing but the quests were fun, the world is interesting and the music was good."
16340,The Best RPG/FPS for u and your friends!!!
16341,A ROWDY GOOD TIME!!!
16342,"One of the best games I've ever played to date. Rightfully earning itself title of ""Game of the Year"", Borderlands is a game that will leave you always waiting for more whether you play alone or with friends. There are virtually no downsides other than minor bugs but are easily overlooked with endless amounts of gameplay. I seriously reccomend this game not just for the co-op and killing but for the vast areas to explore with virtually no limits.

Final Rating: 9.7/10"
16343,"Borderlands is ridiculously fun and addicting. While the main storyline is generally weak, the excellent gameplay, funny humor, and bazillion different guns each with their own look and ""feel"" completely make up for it. Definitely worth it if you hold little value for your productivity. ;)"
16344,"One of the most entertaining shooters/RPGs I have played.  Definitely worth a look.  Of course, you should be buying the GOTY edition anyways."
16345,diablo + fps= borderlands.you just can stop playing.
16346,"40 hours of gameplay MINIMUM and that's without the FOUR expansions!
Fun, fast-paced first-person shooter.
Like playing World of Warcraft, but with guns and grenades."
16347,"A solid FPS with RPG elements.
The game is best played with one other person.
(Don't buy this game for the story)
The classes are fun (except for the soldier class) and the DLC is pretty solid.
A+"
16348,"This game is fucking awesome. It's like WoW with guns on steroids. Shoot things, shoot more things, and shoot things more with big explosions and turrets and overly fast bitches and holy fuck is that a giant worm?

Yeah."
16349,"A very solid first person Diablo-style game.  diablo-style in that, the large focus is on getting pretty new toys to kill things with.  A story exists, but its flimsy at best and really only serves as a backdrop.  The characters and dialogue within that story though, are top-notch.  A wacky, blood-soaked treasure hunt with its own unique style and voice, Borderlands is well worth playing on its own, but the expansions basically make it a must-buy for any fan of the genre."
16350,"このゲームの一番の楽しみ方はフレンドと一緒にCOOPすること。
レア武器を集めることでも、無双することでもない。
敵を協力して叩きのめしたり叩きのめされたりすることの楽しさはひとりではわからない。
唯一気をつける点は、COOPするフレンドとのレベル差が出ないようにすることぐらいか。"
16351,Borderlands is a whole whopping crapton of fun
16352,"I'd give it a 94/100.  Why minus six points?  Because enemies stil gurgle and scream even when their head is blown off and gushing blood.  And because it uses Gamespy of all things for the multiplayer component.  It's a simple, fun game.  It knows what kind of game it is supposed to be, and executes that vision nearly flawlessly."
16353,"buggy,cliche Unreal engine..boring single-play..
But! Almost  ``T.Pratchett approved dialoges``-thumbs up,and good co-op"
16354,"Shooting stuff, a whole lotta stuff, possibly an endless amount of stuff for epic amounts of gear."
16355,"If you like RPG and/or shooters, Borderlands is an excellent FPS-RPG hybrid.  Fun gameplay, beautiful stylized graphics, and a willingness to not take itself too seriously make Borderlands a must-play.  Basically, if you liked Fallout 3 but didn't like the oppressive atmosphere, Borderlands is what you're looking for."
16356,At first I didn't like this game but once I played it a little more I started to really like it!! I like how they added achievements to it now. There are like four DLC's that can be added to the game making it last even longer. My favorite DLC so far is the Zombie Island one. Brrraaaiiinnnnnnns!!! The main thing that I wish that they would change on this game would be the online multiplayer part (which is what I love in games) because for me the mics are very hard to hear and when you join someone's game (other then a friend's) your games missions can get messed up (this is what happened to me). :/  Overall this is definitely an awesome game!!
16357,RPG + FPS! Best of two worlds! This game is a must have if you like RPGs or FPS. If you like both then not having this is even worse! Get this game now! STOP LOOKING AT THE PRICE AND BUY IT!!!
16358,"5 Star recommendation. Action, Humour, Splatter and Non-Stop-Fun. Give it a go. Seriously!"
16359,MUST HAVE IT not me but you :P
16360,A nice game.
16361,This game is badass its a must play ........ with friends
16362,"Borderlands is a wonderfull game. The random weapon generation aspect of the game's treasure chests is really something that no other game can even offer. You may do amazingly well with one character, because you found a super weapon or two at a low level, or have to fight for your life in each area because all you find is crappy weapons. Either way can lead to great fun and challenges.
The multi-player is only really worth playing if you can LAN with some friends in the same room. The game supports microphones, but they're always on and there's no chat-log for text. Few other shooters offer up so such a great co-op option as Borderlans.
Only drawback would be that you only have the four main characters to choose from. You can choose your specialization through your level-up choices, but you're still limited to the four.
There's a good deal of humor in Borderlands, and for an apocalyptic world, it does a good job of not taking its self too seriously."
16363,"If you're looking for story, drama, and interesting charecter development, then this game isn't really for you. However, if you're looking for addicting shooter gameplay, then this game is great for you. Ten times the fun with friends!"
16364,The game is pretty cool. You shoot people. There are some weapons that make the shooting more fun.
16365,"I recomend this game to everone, plus the DLCs are all fantastic, and it truly does have  ""89 bizilion guns""."
16366,"Head over to Moxxi's for some fun, tell em dreggrot sent ya!"
16367,"One of the best games I have ever played, nothing more to say really."
16368,"its fun by yourself, but with friends this beats almost any other co-op game"
16369,"Fun game, but best played co-op"
16370,"Borderlands is an interesting game concept as its ""FPS"" mixed in with ""RPG"".  Kill enemies and gain experience as well as recieving loot dropping from hostiles.

You have 4 characters to play and its similar to Left4dead or GearsOfWar how you can help your teammates back up when they're on the floor.  Alternatively you can kill an enemy to get back up again (which brings along its own weird tatics, like weakening enemies instead of simply killing them, so you know you can revive yourself if you get swarmed).

There are only 4 players who can play at a time and the loot system is just simply drop and pick up which can cause issues from ninja looters, but overall it seems fun to play.  The setting of the game is on a wasteland planet called 'Pandora'."
16371,"Very Addicting game! Unique weapons throughout the game. Fun story! I have beaten the game 5 times. Make sure to get the program WillowTree if you get stuck on a frusterating mission and dont want to take the time to do it all. The online portion of the game is alot of fun and is great to have help beating missions together with someone else. The DLC is really good, some are longer then others. The graphics are great. Gameplay addicting. Get this game if you get a chance on sale. Great game one of my favorites to play with others!!"
16372,"A valiant  attempt at combining role playing games with first person shooters. However, the horrible netcode made it hard for people to play together online. Also, the easily editable save files made hacking super easy. Even still, it's a fun little mad-max-esque game. Send me a message on steam if you ever want to play."
16373,"Great game. I like it a ton! Game play is excellent! Level based very nicely. Multiplayer is easy to join games. Coop multiplayer allows you to achieve missions, levels, weapons while in a party. This game makes it fun to work together, saving each other when facing higher level enemies.
Pro: I LOVE the zombie pack!
Con: You can not legitamatley alter your weapons (as prerelease info said), but there is a great wiki on doing it yourself with a hex. The werewolves put up a great fight, but I wish they weren't were-wracks.
Con: I do not like the arena pack."
16374,Great when you have a friend to play with.
16375,Get....this....game.  It....is....friggin....awsome.  Diablo with guns.  That is all you need to know.
16376,"That's a great game! but it is best with expansions!
If you love coop shooter and rpg buy it, no matter what!"
16377,Great game
16378,"Fun game, awesome guns, kind of repetitive."
16379,Questing and leveling up is fun but could use a little bit more of end-game content.
16380,"Who wouldn't love to run into the world of Diablo with an infinite ammo shotgun that shoots rockets? This is what Borderlands is. An absolute blast, from beginning to end. The DLC's expand upon it even more, albeit you need a friend or two for Mad Moxxi's.

I highly recommend this game; It's just one of the best games I've played in a long time."
16381,Awesome!
16382,Just pure bandit-killing madness!
16383,Very unique graphics. Addicting gameplay. HUNDREDS of weapons. Full 4 player co-op. Lots of enemies. Expect a very RPG styled shooter game. It's like a kids version of Fallout 3. And the story in this game ends abruptly and it left me feeling like I wasted 40 hours for nothing.
16384,Hard to beat Diablo-like gamplay combined with shooter mechanics in a huge world!  Game shines in CO-OP :)
16385,"Simply mind-blowing, but after the first play-through, its just so boring, and game is quite easy unless u get the 3rd DLC. Balance is way off."
16386,"The most fun I've had playing an RPG ever, and the most beautiful art syle I've seen in a game."
16387,"Combines people's current love with FPS with classic dungeon crawling fun.  Attempt to start this game with 3 other people so you're all generally the same level and at the same point while you play.  Having to catchup can be a chore, multiplayer is where the gmae shines and random people online aren't the most trustworthy when it comes to loot"
16388,"Yeah, this game's alright."
16389,"Always a blast, and a great game to play with your friends. The vanilla game is wonderful, and the DLCs just add on to the fun times there are to be had with Borderlands. The unique art style of the game has given it a look that will age very, very well, and the gameplay is fast-paced for all you fps junkies."
16390,trying to be Diablo with guns ... play multiplayer for best results
16391,"Amazing with friends, sort of boring alone.  Gearbox is a shill, don't buy this game."
16392,"Borderlands is the defination of timewaster without paying for a subscription (also joining this game is the Obilivion series). The DLC is pricy and the game's missions are very meh.

You'll probably get sucked into this game if you love guns, have completionist syndrome or like to explore forever and not find anything. Enemies are dicks, but sooner or later you'll find that god gun and everyone will fall in less than two shots. I found the god shotgun (same one from Mass Effect) that fired from across the room and took out bosses in a single blow.

The game is not balanced and wants to be a ""tough game for REAL MEN"" but it doesn't do a very good job at this. Explosions aren't all that great and the world is desolate and can be very boring. Networking is meh and everything is powered by ""blast from the past"" GameSpy Arcade. Borderlands is prone to really bizzare errors.

That said, people will tell you that ""YOU NEED TO EXPERIENCE THIS"", but Borderlands will be no where near your expectations.

Verdict: DEPENDS. 

Additionally, a lot of this game is just hype. It's great for wasting time in, but sooner or later it will lose its appeal."
16393,"Enjoy the guns fellas. The game is fun

To me the marketing factor of this game was guns... guns and guns... Yes the game can have customizable version of a single gun and counts it as a whole different weapon of art. It was disappointing to know that in real that there were no bazillion guns in this game but to me it was never about the guns. 

To expand on my last statement. I would say this game is a work of art. The graphical concept is mind blowing. The game is more fun to be played in a co-op rather than to be enjoyed as a single player as the environment you will play in is huge and you will encounter different genre of nut heads, hunters and flesh eating animals in this game. 

By the end of this game you will be in love with a robot and will want one of your own. Each character has it's own specialization and will add to a whole different experience while enjoying the game. I have no personal favorite for the same reason but you can look at each characters skill tree and then choose of your own. 

Play hard and work on your character and you will out do your enemy each time. Don't forget to make friends it will only make this game work a lot faster and quadruple the fun.

So hang on to them guns and shoot out in a rally as you will find no other game to tally.


A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE
-GODSPEED"
16394,"Think Mad Max, Diablo II, and a first person shooter rolled into one game.  Combine that thought with cell shading and music by Cage the Elephant.  What have you got?  You have a 2009 Game of the Year candidate right there.  The main game here is certainly worth $20 and it is a blast in both single and multiplayer."
16395,Counterstrike meets Diablo 2. It's like crack coated crack!
16396,"Brilliant action/rpg, only flaw is you need people to play it with so its even better than single, i find going around with people you dont know isnt very entertaining.
8/10"
16397,da best
16398,"I'm not normaly into alot of RPGs  but with the Cocktail of  RPG/Shooting and graphic style this game just gives endless amounts of fun, and the fack its also co-op you get to share with friends.. 

I say worth the buy plus the dlcs :)"
16399,"I love this game and there millions of guns..
Actually 3,166,880. guns of you don't belive my.
Look here:
http://www.thatvideogameblog.com/2009/07/28/so-how-many-weapons-does-borderlands-have/"
16400,Awesome game. Just awesome. Worth every cent.
16401,"my steam profile says I've played this for 274.7 hours. There's a reason for that...it's just very good ! Takes a little while to get going initially but has some of the best DLC around and just keeps going. Has some of the best weapons seen a modern shooter and the RPG element doesn't get in the way of the action, it just add an extra flavour to proceedings. It's an FPS with character and gun upgrades."
16402,"Just the BEST !!! ""Ain't No Rest For The Wicked,money dont grow on trees!"""
16403,"Get a 4 pack, this game isn't as fun without friends. That said, it's still an insanely fun game, and feels a bit reminiscent of Fallout 3/NV, and it's funny as all hell if you've got the right (pitch-black) sense of humor."
16404,"Fun with friends, boring without.
DEAL WITH IT."
16405,This game was my favorite game for the longest time primarily because of the superb co-op this game has. The seeded generation of weapons greatly improves the replay value of this game and has excelent downloadable content for a unique experience and many many hours of additional game play.
16406,This game has more guns than you will ever need!!!!
16407,"If you love comic books and shooters, if you get giggly at weapon stats, then this is the game for you. Lots of neat humour, great shooter dynamics and TONS of weapons. Great fun with other people, but no dedicated servers. Sometimes buggy. Lackluster story. Overall, 8/10."
16408,Dark subject matter and gore balanced with odd humor and fun CoOp play.
16409,"The shooter RPG. I like this better than Fallout 3. The Levels and art design are brilliant, and the shooter mechanics work great. The Missions doo get drull and drawn out, I felt like the game has become a chore near the end with the endless fetch and assassination quests.

6/10"
16410,I have never in my life put this much time into what is essentially a shooter (albeit with a few rpg elements).  Good stuff.
16411,Fantastic game with awesome DLC and nice comic style graphics.
16412,Great game for 4-player co-op. I'd highly recommend it for those fans of shooters with an element of role-playing mixed in.
16413,"Fantastic mix of first person shooter and RPG elements.  Hilarious but at  times, off-putting assortment of baddies to pump full of holes using the huge variety of weapons available.  Replayability comes in the form of on-line multi-player and different classes to try out.  Finally, I'd be remiss to not mention the awesome art style on display.  The cell shaded art sets this game apart from the 'Medal of Honour ' style games seemingly everywhere.  --WW"
16414,"Probably my best fps game on steam (other than TF2) is borderlands. The cartoon-like graphics are innovative and always good to look at. It can be played in single player or up to 4 player online co-op, meaning that you can keep coming back for different things.
There are hundreds of missions, which means you always have something to be doing, and the weapons you use to fulfill these missions are all original and have different elements, types and all that.

All in all, a fantastic game which doesn't get boring, especially with the DLCs"
16415,"Wonderful, especially in coop."
16416,Addicting game if you're a loot whore. It's fun solo and 10 times better with friends.
16417,It's like being in an issue of Heavy Metal!
16418,"A yes borderlands, its a very good 4 player coop game allthough friends of mine got bored of it a bit after a while. But still its some good fun if you have a few friends that play it and your bored. The game really becomes fun with four players seeing as there are more enemies and they get stronger. Now the game itself is a first person shooter but with a twist. It has a rpg element so your character will level up but the fun part comes while playing you will pick up weapons that are customly created by the game. So there are endless amount of weapons lying around. To put it blunt its a bit like diablo but then in a diffrent setting and its a FPS game. Alot of people disagree but i say there is definatly a feel of diablo to it."
16419,"Its very good in my opinion is that borderlands is better than fall out but remmember to max the resolution and check everything HIGH on solo offline so it clean graphics..

-vernoes"
16420,"3rd person Diablo with guns.  If you like shooters, but wish you could wander around picking up bigger and badder weapons, and cooperate with your friends (up to 4 players, I think) to kill monsters and raiders on an alien planet, then this will be fun for you.  The video style is awesome, like playing in a comic book.  Violence and language - Not for kids."
16421,"If you haven't played this yet, you are missing out on an EXCELLENT game. Hilarious moments, good visuals.. and a bazillion different type of guns. :D"
16422,"I've put about 50 hours into this game. If you like the RPG genre, millions of weapons and 4 player co-op this is a definite buy."
16423,FPS Diablo with Guns of course!!! Well worth picking up for 4 player coop alone!
16424,"One of the first shooters with RPG elements to really get it right.  Can't get enough of this game, though it's truly a communal experience, and you lose something playing it single-player."
16425,"lol it rock if you hate it your a fucktard
"
16426,"Co-Op + RPG + FPS ... and it's done very well with an interesting setting/mood.  To top it all off, the game is pretty darn inexpensive.  Keep you eye on this for possible sales."
16427,"If you like loot , you'll love this, excellent shooter that keeps you coming back ... best played with friends though. (although going solo is also a rewarding experience). I've racked up nearly 600 hours of gameplay so that pretty much says what I think of it ! :-)"
16428,"THERE AIN'T NO REST FOR THE WICKED. MONEY DON'T GROW ON TREES. I GOT BILLS TO PAY, I GOT MOUTHS TO FEED, AND THERE AIN'T NOTHIN' IN THIS WORLD FOR FREE."
16429,Lilith is my waifu
16430,Do it
16431,"Sometimes a little grindy, but very easy to pick up and play. Lots of fun with friends."
16432,gud gam
16433,"I've played the entire game with all DLC several times and logged over 400 hours of playtime, and another playthrough would still be different.  Very addictive game."
16434,"Great game for anyone who as ever liked first person shooters, and not to mention the huge amount of guns. Also if you get this dont forget to save anyclaptraps you find you will usually find some pretty great guns."
16435,Basically if you like guns and collecting loot then this is the game for you. Brilliant in co-op with friends and some of the guns are utterly insane.
16436,"If you have a friend (or a couple) to play with, this game is great fun, if you play alone if might get a bit repetitive. The graphics is only pretty unique, but it works very well with the style of the game."
16437,Alot of this game doesn't make any sense! The sense has been sacrificed in order to make way for FUN and JOKES :D
16438,THE COW SAYS MOO!!!!
16439,Great game. There is shitloads of weapons tons of enemies and it's always fun to turn enemy's to goo :)
16440,"Absolutely addicted to this game. It's an RPG with out being an RPG. Running around in a post-apocalyptic wasteland ""picking up tin cans"" is an absolute joy and doesn't feel like a grind at all in this action packed Shooter. It's chocked full of some great humor, a lot of action, and a ton of originality and style. It's a fantastic blend of RPG and FPS.

The ability to play co-op is taken a step further in this game by being able to continue with the same character, weapons, and storyline you started in single player(and then turn around and go back to SP) is just absolutely fantastic. 


Honestly, how could anyone turn down a game with shotgun weilding midgets and billions of guns?"
16441,"This game is amazing. hands down. best gameplay ive had in a while. Storyline is minimal as best. but doing all of the quests and missions to level up and loot insanely powerful weapons along your way is where all of the fun lies. Violent, Bloody and Gory, Borderlands is a game that any lover of FPS and RPG's will love. Buy this game you will not be dissapointed. Do not forget to get the DLC!"
16442,"This is in my opinion the best FPS/RPG game, that I have ever tried. 
I bought a 4-pack with some friends when it first came out, and played through ""Playthrough  1"", and reached the max level. Together with 2 friends, we had a lot of fun during this game, and we have even recorded some good moments.

Each class has it's own specific skills and personality, which is also a part of the great gameplay.
From Brick, who can storm the front with bare hands or a heavy gun, to Mordecai, who can stand back, snipe the enemies from a safe distance and send Bloodwing to fight.

Besides the normal gameplay, this game has got a few DLCs, which are mostly great aswell.
I like the whole graphic part cel shading, which also brings a different style to the game, and makes this game special. 

I will highly recommend buying this great game. It is a great game, especially if you have some friends, who are all ready for a great FPS/RPG co-op experience. 
"
16443,Borderlads is Graet! Brick is cool he can knock out a guy with punch. Rolend was one of the bad guys until now. mordecai is a hunter with a killer bird and the sirine hot but deadly. I give Borderlands 5 Stars.
16444,"STRIP THE FLESH, SALT THE WOUNDS."
16445,"Fun shooter with a mix of ""RPG"" elements. ""RPG"" elements consist of large explorable areas with many missions and skills for four different character types. Haven't played multiplayer much -- though from what I did try, it's very fun to play with teammates. Combat is satisfying. Great game from Gearbox!"
16446,"TONS content with dlc, Matured patched game.glad waited is way to go now days. with dlc included like should be in first place anyway, co-op online play, adjustable settings& ini, (turn on dx10 etc etc.3rd person view scripts,editors, just hella fun to explore. will host config fixes. mostly Thx for gift   p.s.(knowitalls,silverspooners& early adopters need not apply)"
16447,"awesome game, well worth the money, gameplay is brilliant as a single player and multiplayer 
download content just adds to the greatness :D"
16448,Probably the best game in its genre.
16449,"This great shooter took me by surprise. Only done 1 playthrough so far, but I know I'll continue and play some more, plus the DLCs"
16450,Actualy a good game with alot of funny hours been playing this game for 140 hours by now and still think it is a good game ( Must Have Game )
16451,"This is a really sweet game tons of action and guns. You level up in it which is why I love it so much of course, the whole map is HUGE and you probably going to discover it all by yourself or with a friend. I only wish there were more characters/classes cause there are only 4 right now, but it still is a good game lot of side quests pretty epic bosses expansions packs are a lot of fun and complete the game except for mad moxxi's underdome make sure you have a whole team for that one (way too hard for only 1 person) 8.3 / 10"
16452,"This game is made by gamers, for gamers. With truckloads of sarcasm, creatures spawned from the wierdest part of the human mind, thousands of weapons and armors, as well as a generally humoristic twist on things, this game has had me laughing for a very long time. The graphic is made in a cartoony style, but it all adds to the feeling that this.. Is fun!"
16453,"I'm only recommending this because if I can get someone else to waste their money on it too, then I'll feel slightly better about myself."
16454,A great game to play with friends. Wouldn't really recommend to play it if you don't have a group of 3 friends to play with.
16455,"If you like shooters and RPGs, this is pretty much the best combination I've played. It's also hilarious."
16456,"Boring by yourself, really. You must have friends to share the fun."
16457,"Very very fun. A little overwhelming at first perhaps, as there's a lot going on, but if you can let that all wash over you and just have fun shooting a lot of things and levelling up, especially with a good friend or 3, then this will quickly find a warm place in your secret psychopathic heart."
16458,Jedna od boljih investicija u zadnje vrijeme. Super igra.
16459,one of my favourite games  and if you get all the dlc will have me to play with  well worth it not yur avarage shooter dont take itto seriously but is a epic game
16460,"Muito bom, divertido, criativo."
16461,"If and FPS and an RPG had a baby, this is it. A perfect blend of FPS action with RPG stats and abilities. I dont think ive ever gotten the same gun twice in this game because there are so many. In depth story and action keeps you there till 3AM on a school night."
16462,something cool
16463,"Good game, play with a friend."
16464,Never expected this strange mixture of Fallout world and conventional RPG components to work this well.
16465,The best game ive played in quite some time.
16466,It's like Thunderdome and Fist of the North Star in one game. What's not to like?
16467,"great rpg interesting till the end, 


overall - 5/5"
16468,"Borderlands is a game that runs a heck of a lot deeper than what you see on the surface. I must admit that when I first looked at this game, I thought it looked far too average to be interesting to check out. But after all the attention it's been getting, I decided to give it a try to see what all the noise was about. And I'm SO GLAD I DID. Stylish comic book inked visuals are a refreshing change from all the photorealism that other titles are sticking to. The tongue-in-cheek humor is what really holds this title together in many ways. It's quite simply a shooter that doesn't take itself too seriously in an ocean of other FPS's that do exactly that. There's plenty to love here too. I'm not really an FPS fan because I honestly really suck at them. But Borderlands seems to be BUILT with gamers like me in mind, because it sports a rather generous aim assist. This can be turned on or off in the options, but an addition like this makes Borderlands a LOT more approachable for non-FPS gamers."
16469,Damn fine game.  Lots of fun.
16470,Great FPSRPG but it got boring after the third DLC
16471,Nothings more fun then killing infinate enemies with over a billion guns. ^_^
16472,Can't have enough
16473,"Where do I start with this game...? The amont of guns, RIDICULOUS. The dialogue, CLASSIC. The co-op, GOOD TIMES. Nuff said. GO BUY."
16474,"Sweet 4 player class based alien killing action... but not the same as alien swarm, which also fits the description.  I think the sci-fi FPS diablo is an apt description."
16475,"The idea of this game is that you're trying to find a hidden treasure in a vault somewhere, but it's largely a trick to make you work hard for all of your money, and thus realize how it is truely the jouney that matters, not the destination. This is a complicated way of saying that you will grind for nothing for thirty hours, you fucking SUCKER."
16476,"There ain't no rest for the wicked in this RPG co-op shooter.  What sets Borderlands different from other shooters are: the thousands of different stat weapons to collect, baddies to kill, adult humor, loot to collect, and numerous locals to explore.  Other than those, the game comes with more featured DLC  like zombies, claptraps, arena mode, and higher-level baddies to destroy.  

Even though with all of these content added into the game, the shooting can get repititive at most points and the only way to properly level up faster is to tackle every single side-quest in the game.


Oh yeah, this game comes with an early demo to Duke Nukem Forever.  So buy this game."
16477,No rest for the wicked.
16478,The most fun you'll ever have with a FPS!
16479,"Borderlands is one of those unique pleasure that I revisit often due to the memorable gameplay, unique atmosphere, and consistent performance that I wish some other games had going for them.

In simplist terms Borderlands is a first-person shooter with aspects of loot progression found in memorable titles like Diablo and Diablo II (this is kind of a joke as there are many other games to have this style of loot progression, but most people just assume that Blizzard invented it with the Diablo series).

Throughout the game you choose one of four classes and play through a somewhat linear storyline with side-quests which contain brilliant dialogue fleshing out a universe that is most certainly unique. While Borderlands pertains to a post-apocalyptic, many theatrical elements from the most famous of movies don't really apply here while some of the titular themes do carry over.

You have Pandora; a world which seems to be overseen by outlaws and major corporations that have a financial interest in hunters looking for this famous treasure known simply as the Vault. The Vault is a treasure not actually defined during the adventure, but is presented as a Pandora's box of sorts promising fame, fortune, and power to the finder.

The gameplay consists of actiony first-person shooter sections which are combined with loot-progression by using weapons and shields that influence how powerful the character is and how well they can survive being attacked by a large number of different types of enemies. Whether it be bandits roving around Pandora looking for (and I am just now getting why the place is called Pandora) booty or beasts simply looking for blood, the player is forced to survive in a rather harsh environment. That's not to say they aren't equipped for the situation, but it is certainly a situation where at any given moment the player will be thrust into hardship against ever-changing enemies and a slew of antagonists which may or may not be related to one another.

Loot progression occurs through different types of firearms that offers different speeds at which rounds are propelled towards enemies and the damage those rounds do. Whether you decide to go with a sub-machine gun to keep a steady stream of bullets aimed at numerous on-screen enemies or utilize a sniper rifle to deliver a powerful punch, there are many ways a single player can dispatch of their targets. Not only this, but up to four players can get together to fight enemies together and try to conquer Pandora.

Progress does seem uneven in some spots making it difficult to take on the most difficult enemies in the game. During the game some enemies are given the ""badass"" tag which enables them to be a complete hindrance towards players. It is hard to deal with them, but it can be equally difficult for players to ignore them. This is especially true in a single-player game.

Progression ultimately requires players to think about their situation and use the right equipment and the right character skills to get past whatever they are dealing with. The large number of loot boxes and the random drops give them ample opportunities to get useful equipment which may even give them the power to effortless move forward until met with a challenge beyond which they have dealt with to that points.

Visually the game has a unique feel to it. With the larger border around objects and a cartoon-ish style, it is somehow not difficult to take the story seriously. This is probably due to how direct characters are within the game or due to how easy it is to be absolutely obliterated if you take foes too lightly. This is especially true later on in the game where enemies can absolutely destroy players which haven't taken the time to understand their attack patterns and weaknesses.

Audibly the game has an interesting soundtrack and great voiceovers for memorable characters in the game. Accessing the catch-a-ride or purchasing weapons or ammo (or even shields and healing items) gives the player memorable quotes while the quest line has a lot of acting in it worthy of the original price tag. Granted that this game is quite dated, it can be obtained for rather cheap. With the DLC in-tact, this game is well worth the price tag and surprisingly holds up well in 2017.

I would recommend this for someone looking for something different that hasn't played the series before. If you're looking for something with similar gear progression to the Diablo series while providing you with challenge and intrigue, Borderlands could very well be the title for you. The sequel offers a lot more in-depth and some of the same on the surface for those interested in digging deeper into the story. I can't quite comment on the pre-sequel as while I own it, I haven't had the time nor the group effort I would like to put into the game. I will admit this series is best played in a group, but I have played through both games on my own. Don't let the lack of a dedicated group stop you from enjoying a unique storyline and great gameplay."
16480,it's ok
16481,"This was typed by Zombie overlords sister ""The Female Headcrab"" even though she doesn't have steam.XD

I love the style and the art 2K and gearbox did within this game. It's badass and my kind of style =D.The graphics are amazing and differentiates from most of todays modern games. It reminds me of Sly Cooper kind-of graphics although not as cartoonish. 1st person shooters can be mindless shooting at times which bores me a bit, but the fact that they mixed it with rpg elements like gaining XP and quests/objectives with the freedom to explore vast worlds has made me grown to love this game. (I'm a HUGE fan of rpg games) My favorite character is claptrap. He's adorable!!! He's like the more cheerie and excited version of Clank. Sometimes i confuse calling claptrap as boxtrap. I don't know why... 
Cost: $20(original)
 $50(game of year) <-recommend
Rating: 95/100 Awesome!!!"
16482,"What Fallout 3 could have been with appropriate multiplayer! This fantastic co-op game brings a wasteland type of experience on the world of Pandora, no radiation here, but instead a combination of great classes, weapons, and gameplay styles with upgradable, and unlockable, abilities that allow you to tailor your chosen class to be your own. The missions are fun and varied, the vehicles are fun to drive, and you can have a companion ride along and take over gunning. There are alot of co-op possibilities and options, so don't be afraid to hook up with a buddy or two and get some quests done! A must have for anyone into first person shooters with excellent co-op support and implementation."
16483,"Best Game of 2009. Really fun to shoot guys in, great AI, awsome loot system."
16484,"The -other- ""Oblivion with guns""."
16485,"Damn good game. Quirky, huge, and plenty of things to do."
16486,"As an FPS with light RPG elements, a vast quantity of quasi-unique procedurally generated loot, and drop-in/drop-out cooperative multiplayer, Borderlands is among the foremost Skinner boxes to which it is legal to expose yourself. Furthermore, the art style is unique and delightful, even though that's not ideally conveyed by the box cover."
16487,To play together
16488,Stupid but fun
16489,Get 3 friends and go looting and hunt for the best weps.
16490,"Strip the flesh, salt the wounds......HA HA HA!"
16491,"A game that mixes RPG elements with FPS, this is another favorite of mine. Good humor, great art style, and tons of fun weapons. I find this game to be a great relaxation method."
16492,"You can't go wrong with this game, loads of fun."
16493,"A mighty fine cooperative game with friends, and possibly one of the best role-playing shooters on the market. If you love RPG's but also love Shooters, you'll feel right at home in Borderlands."
16494,Addictive and extremely replayable!
16495,The perfect blend of looting and killing. The Vikings would be proud.
16496,I Love it! BUY IT!!
16497,Everyone should get Borderlands it is so much fun exploring with friends. Oh and the loot oh the amazing loot. :)
16498,"Like L4D, if you can get 3 mates together, a love of carnage and comedy and are ready to swear over the mic at each other, take a trip to Pandora (no, not that one with poxy cat-smurfs, the REAL Pandora) and get ready to lock and load.

The only drawback is a lack of non-co-op multiplayer."
16499,Awesome!
16500,"Really fun game.  Only 4 player though, and it's a bit finiky to get set up."
16501,"simple stupid fun, cartoon mad max"
16502,Balls to the Wall action.
16503,"This game is fun. This game is fun with three friends.

As Left 4 Dead made Co-Op in this from popular, this piece of software nearly perfected it. The only big issue is the lack of a good story. Like in all Action RPGs (one part of this game) the missions are either about killing someone or about finding something. But how the game presented this is amazing! But you have to love such type of optic.

So for all who have at least three good friends on Steam, who like the ""Just-One-More-Mission""-gameplay should really buy this game. And also all DLCs (beside the Moxxi-DLC, as this DLC offers no real story, just shooting in an arena)."
16504,"If you like dirty humor and 1 billion random generated weapons and listening to an awesome soundtrack while kicking ass this is the game for you.

It's true that this game is a FPS and RPG blend, but the RPG portion is very light and easy for newbies."
16505,"An awesome game, spent hours upon hours on this one.
Maybe a little too much time to be honest, I do recomend this game and all of it's DLC's (well maybe not Moxxi)"
16506,"All right! A shooter that has RPG elements? Sounds like a waaaaaaay better Fallout 3! Lootfest??? Diablo???? NAAAAHH! If you like Diablo or the Fallout Series, then you will LOVE BORDERLANDS!! GET The ""Game Of The Year Edition"" for ""Duke Nukem Forever"" First Access Membership!!!"
16507,"Awesome game, can never stop playing this game!!"
16508,"Awesome game, WITH FRIENDS... alone is boring."
16509,"Borderlands at its core is spectacular: the gunplay is solid, the setting is endearing, and the loot is an addiction. On top of this, it looks beautiful, and the humor is on point.

It is, however, ridiculously unpolished overall. The menus will drive you nuts, and the networking is often unreliable. I think the good outweighs the bad, but be aware."
16510,It has a lot of guns for shooting people in the face.
