13,"After close to 4000hrs I've decided to leave a review.

The gameplay remains unchanged over the 7 years it's been around. There is the idea of don't mess with a good thing, but the gameplay and game modes haven't grown or evolved at all. The same thing you were doing 7 years ago is the same thing you're doing now and it's pretty stale. Psyonix has tried to add novelty game modes for limited time and thankfully they were limited because they have all been horribly designed and not fun at all. For years I've been wanting A HORSE like game mode for the training packs where you and a friend or friends can go into a training pack together and play HORSE while practicing the training pack shots. It's not much, but it would add a lot of value to the game because training packs are pretty boring by yourself for hours on end. But no, let's add a shitty football game mode to a soccer game with cars. Also, they've had the same exact rumble weapons for since the beginning. Why not add some new ones or change things up by having the weapons cycle each season or every hours or so like Apex Legends does with its map rotations so you have to change up your tactics? These aren't revolutionary ideas, but Psyonix would rather just sit back and do the bare minimum and pump their stale cash cow.

A couple years ago, the game transitioned into a battle pass monetization business model and the game has gotten decidedly worse for it. It used to have a thriving third party trading community, but Psyonix was greedy and wanted a piece of the pie. So they moved to the battle pass structure, changed the in game currency, and limited the in game items to be only purchasable with the new currency. This had three negative outcomes, 1: it completely killed the trading community, 2: they also over inflated the prices of everything so a lot of the cheaper items are now not worth it the effort to trade or the money to buy, and lastly 3: the only real way you can get items now is waiting for them to rotate into the extremely limited item store. The items in the item store rotate out but there's so many items and variations of them that you're going to be waiting a LONG LONG time for the specific item you were looking for, oh and btw if you buy and item in the shop it's not tradable with further added to the destruction of the trading community. Who the hell thought that was a good idea? The majority of the items in the season passes are recycled assets or recycled ideas in some way shape or form which makes it seem like they're not even worth the grind. And it is a grind because you get so little XP for game wins. It's really not even worth your time unless you're actively working on the season pass challenges for the XP boosts.

The most egregious change imo was the shifting of the MMR player rating tiers. Grand Champ used to be the highest rank. Then they finally added Supersonic Legend above Grand Champ along with Grand Champ 1, Grand Champ 2, and Grand Champ 3, and they shifted all the other tiers down in MMR to ""balance the tiers."" This blended Champ 1, Champ 2, and Champ 3 with Grand Champs so now most of the lobbies I play in have Grand Champs and the games become total sweat fests even in casual including triple WHAT A SAVE spams in quick chat.

This used to be my favorite game as you can probably tell from my close to 4000 hours logged. Unfortunately, it's just gotten incredibly stale and the MMR change, the lazy season passes, and lazy devs have turned what used to be my favorite game into something that I only hop into on rare occasions when I get the itch and have forgotten how stay it is."
14,"Rocket league is as intrinsically interesting and naturally beautiful, while also as barren and lifeless are outer space itself. After a combined 13,649 hours across multiple accounts I have some comments. First of all, much like in outer space, the ball never touches the fking ground. Ironically you play the game in a CAR as opposed to a rocket ship and attempting to fly up into the unknown in a fking honda civic after a floating basketball is gdamn impossible. The graphics and the community are pleasing and wholesome. I give it 3/5 stars tbh."

27,"It's rocket league. Gameplay doesn't ever really change much... which is awesome! It's very technical and creates an extreme skill ceiling which reflects its extremely competitive pro scene and playerbase. Once Epic acquired it the market all but died off for me, maybe it's different for others but trading up just isn't worth it anymore. That being said do yourself a favor and buy whatever cosmetics you want from other players for a tenth of the price in their ""epic"" shop."

67,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

152,"This game is fun to play solo or with people you enjoy gaming with. I get to load it up once a year or so and drive around in the tumbler from TDK trilogy and once I have that fix, I uninstall the game again.

But I have to do this with a tiny picture in the middle of my large, beautiful monitor.

This was a new issue when the game joined up with Epic Games instead of Steam and did the cross-play shenanigans.

I tried to find a fix for this issue. I asked The Google and the only answer I found was, ""Hit alt-enter."" That didn't work. I got a tiniER screen in the middle of my desktop instead of in the middle of a black screen. I went to the Steam discussions. Those are all locked and gone (presumably after the Epic Games shift) and the FAQ section of their locked topics showed very little. So I went to the Guides section, in the hopes that someone posted a fix for this graphics issue. No help there, which brings me to the end part.

Most of the guides that players have posted were not about how to play the game better, not about how to fix graphics problems (there was one with suggested settings, but the fact that all he did was type out the descriptions of each setting that I could clearly see when I moved the mouse over the individual settings is really sort of like that other guide I saw, but that one I put in the next category.) MOST of the guides were about how to be a jerk. How to be a troll. How to be toxic and get away with it. How to get other players to rage and then report them. This is next level toxicity in a community. Oh, and that other guide I mentioned? How to uninstall the game, with the implication how to uninstall because you are not a good player and can't ""git gud"" or whatever those people are saying these days.

TLDR: some fun game play, but a swirling sea of toxicity if you want to play online with anyone other than those you know personally."

Every dame of rocket league you play is filled with intensity and will have you inching slowly closer to your monitor. You will find your self making an epic save and cheering with your friends or watching your teammate score an incredible goal. If you don't yet have the joy of playing rocket league in your life, you are missing out."

173,"Great game but is now getting boring. You are playing competitively and get banned for banter, don't buy this. It really is addictive junk, being banned when a team mate doesn't move and you call them a fag is ridiculous. People on this are also pathetic, and play to increase stats. Political Correctness over the top, I really despise all this when you can't insult back! I'm uninstalling and will never play again."

193,"From the 250 ping playing with American buddies back in 2016..
To a blissful 17 going solo.. stuck at 87/88 achievements because I'm lonely.
From the skills I learned going from Gold to Plat.. rotations.. passing.. err.. yep..
To a now semi-consistent Grand Champ newbie; never to learn a thing while raging at every teammate.
From my first desk; may it rest in peace. To my second.. it lasted quite a while.
And here I am, almost 2000 hours in, and my third finally broke down on me.

I hate this game sometimes.. but I'm addicted.. You should play it too."
194,This is the best game I have ever played. It has consumed my life in a way nothing else has. I hate it. You'll love it.
195,"Rocket League is a great game; near infinite skill ceiling, is very fun to play with your friends, very active player base, always being updated and will eventually be moved to UE5, is somewhat difficult depending on the degree you want to learn, is rewarding when you pull of that double flip reset double musty psycho, Etc. Etc. Etc. You get the point. 

The only negatives i'd have to add would be that after it went ""Free to Play"" it became infested with smurfs. Its not so much a problem as you get higher in the ranks because they have less of an effect on the game due to the skill gap not being as large, but at the lower ranks its a mess. The second problem would be that the servers aren't consistent. I'm not going to sit here and say that they're always bad because a majority of the time they are solid, but when the servers are bad, THEY'RE AWFUL. It's impossible to play a game like rocket league with lag because everything you need to do has to be so precise. But those would have to be my only complaints against the game itself aside from the season rewards but we get those for free so i'm not too mad.

When i started playing I learned Rocket League with free air roll. There is nothing wrong with free air roll, many people make it to SSL with it, but I just don't feel as fast and as mechanical as the other players my rank. So now, I am going to restart and learn directional air roll at the advice of others who want to see me in anguish.
 Love the game tho! 

*If you want to actually learn RL, I recommend you learn with DIRECTIONAL air roll lol*

TLDR: Rocket League Awesome and Trash. Learn Directional Air Roll."

221,"This game is one of the few games I know of that truly rewards you based off of your time put into it. This game you have to put in time to reap the rewards. Rocket League isn't a game you just slip into and reap all the rewards, I dedicated my life to Rocket League. Very fun when progressing upwards and seeing your progress outplay people in matches. Also very angering when you feel at a standstill and you can't progress. Overall I give this game a 8.3/10"

229,"its easy and then the next minute its really hard again. 791hrs in, its hard 9/10"
230,"servers need upgraded,  demos are broken, but the game is addictive."
231,"The community absolutely sucks. It used to be so much better, but now the company seems focused entirely on everyone using nice words, and does absolutely nothing about the mountain of trolls and leavers. Automatic 5 minute ban for leaving a ranked match... 24 hour ban for asking people to report the leaver/troll. The numbers go up from there. If you comment badly about someone completely lacking proper behavior, you get banned. Your own teammate intentionally shooting the ball at your goal over and over? Your entire team leaves and one of the opposing team explodes you repeatedly the second you spawn so you can't even play? Don't say anything that might hurt their feelings or you get banned... and the ban appeal will have you talking to the rudest customer service you've probably ever talked to before they tell you they won't do anything and hang up on you. You can troll however you want to without any consequences whatsoever, as long as you only use ""nice words."""

251,"Fun game, but the match making is absolutely frustrating.
The game says it is unfair to abort a game mid match, of course it is. But why are you put into a game mid match in the first place.
I've been constantly put into games were I'm 3 or 4 null behind, only like 1 min to go and a unplayable high ping. it is no fun being put into games like that. Games that you have no chance of winning! HOW IS THAT FAIR? And when you get out you been punished for it with a ban.
Bans should not be given just because.
Next is the thing about being put into games with random people against teams.
Teams that play all the time together, know there team mates, have tactics ans so on. You and average joy against a non stop rocket league playing team. HOW IS THAT FAIR?
This stuff happens all the time and just takes the fun out of the game."
252,"Without a doubt one of the best videogames ever created. The fundamental game design is so solid that this game has become a sport itself. The premise is simple, play football/soccer (basketball as well) with remote control rocket powered and propelled cars... the premise is simple but the physics system is so deep that this game has an everlasting evolving meta. It's insanely fun by yourself or with friends. While it can get toxic like any other free to play multiplayer game, its still some of the most fun you can have. Highly recommended, would steal your boost again."
253,bad
254,I do not recommend this game

313,"[h1]Rocket League is a game where it's perfection is on how the game itself is.[/h1]
You drive [i]""rocket-powered""[/i] cars and score goals in a soccer/football field in diverse and unique ways, you can make your very own cars [b](with custom colors, decals, wheels, rocket boosts, trails, engines and much more!)[/b] and play with your teammates in groups or not, and win the match as you climb up the ranks to become the ultimate [b]Supersonic Legend.[/b]


Of course, even though there are a few flaws, such as [i](sometimes)[/i] the servers are not the best, there a few pay to win features, a considerable amount of toxic players, you can enjoy this game in various ways in playlists, like:
[quote=author][b]Casual,[/b] where you can play for fun in[b] 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4.[/b][/quote]
[quote=author][b]Competitive,[/b] where the game's either basic and simple in lower ranks or really advanced and mechanical in higher ranks. [/quote]
[quote=author]And, the [b]Special Gamemodes[/b], where everything is a Soccar mayhem and chaos in [b]Rumble, Hoops, Snow Day and Dropshot![/b][/quote]


[h1]Struggling in how to improve your gameplay?[/h1]
No problem! If you access the training menu in [b]Play[/b] at the Start Menu, you can choose to do the [b]Basic Tutorial,[/b] the [b]Advanced Tutorial[/b] and the [b]Aerial, Goalkeeper, Striker[/b] or mess around in [b]Free Play.[/b] However, if you want to take it to the next level, you can also search for the [b]Custom Training[/b] section that includes maps that the community made. However, it is very important that you change your Camera and Controls settings so that you can be adapted with a good gameplay.


Here are a few good Custom Training Codes that helped me [b][i]a lot[/i][/b] and that you can paste by pressing the[b] ENTER CODE[/b] button in the Trainings Browser:

[h1]Wanting good cosmetics but don't know how?[/h1]
Luckily for you, there are many sites for trading in Rocket League, it may take a while to get used to it, but if you start out in simple trades with low rarity trades (like Rocket Pass Free Tier items), then start accumulating Credits and trade those credits for better items (and so on), you will [b]soon [/b]get the item of your [b]dreams![/b]
Websites like [b]RL Garage[/b] can sure help you out on this one!


[h1]Do you like chaos and madness or you want more quality of life features but the game doesn't offer much?[/h1]
This can be easily solved by installing the unofficial, fan-made plugin [b]BakkesMod[/b], that contains many features that we wanted for [b][i]years[/i][/b]. While the developers [b]do not recommend using it[/b], it offers [b][u]no problems to your device and cannot get you banned from the game[/u][/b], plus you can also make a lot of videos or simply having fun with your friends with it! Sadly it is only available on PC.


[h1]Liked the game?[/h1]
Well, then you can install it and become the legend [b]Rocketeer [/b]in this car-soccer videogame! However, if you are on PC, you can install it on Epic Games, since it is not available on Steam since 2020."
314,good
315,this game is ass and anyone that plays it is a big virgin
316,"Great basic game. Skill based, absolutely no pay to win. Highly toxic community in lower ranks which improves as you move up ranks where people seem to be more accepting and civil of a loss."
317,its dope
318,ball car good
319,"damn thought by know i would of known but this game aint what it was years ago and will never be the same the lag in servers there shit items they are just trying to get in all of the kids' parents, pockets. Also,  wow epic put in a feature to tell u if Ur teammates are bad just look to see if there in a civic odds are there... Wouldn't recommend new player cause the MMR systems Is based on random generator one game is bots the next RLCS Championship. hey but oh well devs dont listen if they make money, so move on time, have funn all 3.5 Stars"
320,Game's super great when you disable the chat and the others are courteous
321,"Since 2015, first from console (PS4) then since 2019 from PC, nearly 2800 hours. What to say, sometimes makes you really pissed off, most of people in the game ain't nice, since the game has been bought by Epic Games the servers are awkward, but it also has flaws. Seriously, this game is nice, but it has an hidden part where the new players might be trapped in. Full of toxicism, and the fact that the game has been released for free on the Epic Games Launcher doesn't help. Anyway, if you decide to play it, then you'll better be patient and please, don't be catched by the dark side of it. Good luck"
322,This game is good
323,I like Balls
324,Cars-Boys
325,"Literally no other game ist like rocket league!
It delivers both competitive gameplay with a high skillcurve as well as fun casual gameplay with friends.

417,"Rocket League is less of a ""sports game"" and more of an actual sport. In FIFA or Madden you have a ""pass"" button, but to make a pass in Rocket League you have to drive your car into the ball at the right speed and angle to send it over to where your teammate is going. You have to create the pass yourself, and it can be anything, from a hard bounce off the back wall to a soft lob over the defender.

Passing, shooting, dribbling, tackles, jukes, they're all in the game, but you have to make them happen yourself, not just press the right button. At first, just driving car to ball is a challenge, but as your skill grows, the freedom to create any play you can imagine and execute is unlike anything you'll find in a ""sports game"". Together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ball, you'll have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sense.

There are very few games that are consistently rewarding for hundreds or thousands of hours, that can keep challenging you as you improve, and improve, and improve beyond what you ever imagined you'd be capable of. In fact, this is the ONLY one I know.

Every game has its issues here and there. Whether it be server issues or game play issues, but for the most part, the game is 95% clean. I've spent countless hours just practicing and trying to get better. I think what keeps me playing this game is the endless drive to be better. Better my skills to take on better opponents, winning those game where you feel outplayed is so rewarding. But its then matched with the lows of losing 4-5 gaming in a row. It's the drive to get better that keeps me fueled in this game and will not stop playing.

Solid 10/10 game."

424,"Psyonix has let this game deteriorate massively. Since f2p, smurfing has gotten completely out of control and as a result the ranking system is a total joke.
I've soloq'd to Grand Champion in multiple playlists, and have lost just about all enjoyment that I used to get from the game.
They've been given dozens of solutions on all of the forums, but take zero action.
Games at or around GC level (around 1500 elo) vary in quality from what feels like 1000-1600, so you may as well just toss a coin at the beginning of most games and spare yourself the 5 minutes of mismatched BS."
425,Rocket cars hit ball real good...... once you learn rocket pilot controls.

435,solid
436,This game has consumed my life. There is no hope. My hands can no longer put down the controller. I have become one with the car. I can no longer think outside of the game. Don't let the game ruin your life like it ruined mine. I am even playing while typing. It is very hard to type while playing rocket league and holding a controller. All I can think about is making my car fly through the air magnificently in ways that have never been seen before. I have become one with the ball. The ball has become on with me. There is no hope for my life. The only thing that I can do is play this game. Don't let my amount of hours fool you. I do not recommend this game to anyone. This game will suck your soul into it. There is no hope for your life after you try this game. You will soon lose all consciousness and become one with the game. The game will take your soul and you will become the useless fat guy in your mother's basement like you always wanted to be. You will also lose all your money because you must have all of the wheels and decals that exist. You will become one with the wheels. You will no longer need to look at the game. Once the game consumes your soul you will just play off of feel and not sight.
437,no
438,Good fun with mates :D
439,What a Save!!
440,The best videogame as all the match depends on your ability and not stats. The most close you'll be to real football (soccer) in a videogame format. Great esport also

488,"For PC players, there is something fundamentally wrong in their matchmaking code that is placing players in their placements matches with PC players more frequently than anyone else. Of 20 games, nearly half of the games I was placed with a player in their placements, and of all 10 games with placements players, they were on my team, not the opposing. I assume this is due to mostly Xbox/Playstation players queuing and some matchmaking issue that prioritizes placement match players into PC teams. Almost every single placement match player is a thrower or a boosted/bought account. These players are so clearly out of their rank that I have been able to predict when I have a placements teammate just by seeing them complete miss hits over and over in a Diamond 3 match. This is a genuine concern for me, and the chances of having 10/10 placements players on my team are 1 in 59000."

500,"With a total of 3174 STEAM hours into this game somewhere close to 52-53 days, I can confidently say this game is a waste of space. Full of smurfs and title hunters that pay to get ranked up (by said smurfs), which while it always was a problem it never used to be so bad. These last 2-3 seasons have been swarmed and inundated with carried idiots that absolutely destroy any chances of climbing the ranks because they do NOT know what they are doing, as of 04/09/2022 I have fully uninstalled it. I worked hard everyday to improve and get so called good, but i cannot and will not endure the headaches and BS that comes with being dragged down while struggling my nuts off to rank up. Do i make mistakes YES absolutely, am I perfect NO absolutely not, but i should have made progress easily. But when paired against players that are squaded up (and most likely 1 on an alt account) so when I Solo Q, and I end up with 1 or even 2 idiots that are literally barely out of gold possibly platinum rank absolutely screwing me out of any advancement the game stops being fun or challenging (for the right reasons). So enough is enough, I have removed it from my library and fave games, gg @Psyonix some great fixes to stop this crap."

512,"The game's auto bans for the chat filter are insane. Yes I might have said something harsh, but there was literally nobody in the lobby I was in when I said something in chat. It makes no sense to get a ban for 3 days, preventing me from making progress on rocket pass challenges for 3 days when the season is this close to ending is absolutely ridiculous, considering I never said a word to anyone but an empty lobby. I will forever keep my reviews for this game negative. There is no redeeming this game. The developers are simply not it..."
513,ive played a lot of this game and im continuously disappointed at how shitty and toxic the community is. ive seen people continuously harass and insult another player through an entire match for literally no cause and when i reported it nothing was done because they didnt use any slurs. plus voice chat isnt helping. im playing this game to relax and have fun and its ruined by all the bullshit
514,fuck this game
515,Good game. Cars go fast.

526,i got called a slur
527,"Take this recommendation with a grain of salt as I am incredibly biased towards this game. Rocket League is a magnificent game where the ceiling of improvement feels almost infinite. There is always things you can work on and improve on. They can be flashy mechanics that after set-up are almost invincible or an incredibly consistent play style that punishes even the smallest of mistakes. I played the game up to Diamond 3 as just a game for fun and improvement, it gave months worth of entertaining content made possible by friends I met in match. For those on who like the more competitive side of games, unsurprisingly rocket league has competitive game modes with their own ranking systems. As of right now, I play in tournaments that are held by a third party outside of rocket league (that said I just want to briefly warn a few people that there are tournament scams in which someone asks you to join them in a tournament and use the information you type in to take your steam account). As for some downsides, skills gained in Rocket League don't transfer that great into other games. The other downside is solo-queuing can be frustrating with not knowing if your tm8 is toxic or at your level. Meeting someone in match that you like is a great way to avoid this. Most of the people I still play with today are people I met back in Diamond (or people they were already playing with). To sum all this up, Rocket League is a great game that rewards the time you spend on it. I highly recommend giving it a try and finding some people that are a similar skill level as you to play with and improve with!"

533,"Great game for those who enjoy a comp, high skill gap type of game, or just like soccer. I remember the early game being tons of fun but once you make it to around platinum rank you'll realise just how vast the skill gap in this game really is. I've played this game for thousands of hours and still suck so I'd for sure say give it a try just to see if you do enjoy it."
534,"Hard to recommend because of how utterly toxic most of the community is, but the actual gameplay is just too good."

557,its alright
558,Same old awful matchmaking
559,Hate this game
560,"I've been playing the game since release and it's actually solid. But there are more and more players who are badly behaved.
They trashtalk, insult and if you try to talk to them reasonably you get more and more insulted. I always try to ask these people why they say these bad words and insult for no reason. I want to understand them. But either they ignore you or they continue to insult you. 
The sad thing is that I am always friendly to people and it really hurts with time that these people are the opposite.
I realized that this game is no longer good for me and played less and less. I took longer and longer breaks (several months).
Unfortunately it is useless to report these people. They are not banned permanently, at most they are banned from the games for a few minutes.

Yes, I think you can turn off the chat. But I want to chat with people. Some conversations are really nice. Unfortunately, the fewest. But these I do not want to miss. It should not be the solution to have to disable chat as a game feature, but that bad behavior is punished in the long run.

Conclusion: The game can be recommended in terms of gameplay. If you don't mind playing without chat, go for it. Otherwise, don't.

The EU servers are slightly more powerful, than my grandmother's toaster, the vast majority of the community consists of people going AFK right away, people who flood the chat with toxicity and negativity.
If you want a casual game to just kick back and relax after a rough working day, this is certainly NOT the game for you.
It *may* be worth if you go into games premade with friends.
In any other case, find some other game/something else to enjoy."

644,"Honestly, this game is really well made, there's nothing else like it, fifa or racing games are very different from this. It's a very unique game and kudos to the creators for that, i will say, it can get very repetitive at times, and the toxicity in the community doesn't help. The game also takes a long time to get the hang of in comparison to other games. However, it's a really fun game with tons of gamemodes, cars to pick from, and countless ways to score. There's so many mechanics you can try to learn and master! Overall i do recommend this game."

I tried it again in 2021 and liked it again but I couldn't put it in my favorites but now it's one of my favorite games . 
The steam version is better but now you cant buy on steam only on epic!
About the game : 
I like the unranked for funny playing with friends . 
You can play unranked 1v1 , 2v2 , 3v3 and 4v4 .
Competitive is better but you need to focus .
In competitive you can play 1v1 2v2 3v3.
You can play extra modes : hoops , dropshot , snow day and rumble This is the best modes I love all .
The game is about working as a team and kicking a goal , it might be weird at first but since it's free on Epic it's worth a try! I give this game 5 stars! Test It !"

So it's either sit with the troll for 5 mins to wait to quit, or quit and get a penalty to be unable to join queue. So skewed to punish those who want to play the game and not mess with others.

800,"Everytime I come back to this game I have to relearn everything for square 1, but it never gets old hitting a nasty shot."
801,.
802,What a save!
803,"I have a few hours in this game now, so, I figured I could write a review. Rocket League is one of the hardest games to master and with 2,696 hours (at the time I'm writing this review) I can safely say that I still suck at this game. But it keeps bringing me back, seven year later. This is Rocket League!"
804,"ever since the game went out, its a great game. it takes skill to understand the mechanics of the game. if you dont even worry about the toxic players and teammates, you'll be fine."

819,"Car go broom, ball go boom"
820,very nice
821,"It's the kind of game where, if you take a break, you'll come back to see players doing things you didn't know possible. The community doesn't always get along, but I still consider it to be my favourite game. I look forward to see how the game progresses."
822,"Rocket League has been the best game ever, flawless everytime and my always go to game to play. I love it!

829,Addicted to the game. Really entertaining and would recommend 100%
830,good game
831,"Love the game. Hate the dev/owners.
Psyonix and Epic are far worse than the players toxicity level.

They promote high ranks to make new accounts to clip and talk down to users with nasty acronyms.
Mention it back to one of these smurfs either directed or not directed at someone and get a ban.

Reported both of the guys I was talking about below but when I got a ban I watched their rocket tracker continue to climb from gold/plat to C2-C3. Opened a ticket and was told to use in-game reporting, which I did with no action.

""a smurf.. clearly not in Diamond.. maybe follow your own advice of kys"" in response to a ""ur bad"" ""kys"" message (RL tracker - Less than 50 games this season, none previous)
Talking to the other team that teammate busy flooding ""fa."" directives in team chat instead of playing after they asked if partner dc'd.

Took longer to get an answer on the repel than the 3 day ban. 

You'll probably enjoy the game but good luck getting help with any issue."
832,"Pro: super fun casually and competitive , Multiplayer and Solo are fun , Alot of cosmetics

Cons: getting out of gold is hard."

917,Hmm... free rocket on steam? ez
918,"Rocket League is a startlingly simple game. You control a car by accelerating, reversing, jumping, boosting, and power sliding. The object is to outscore the opposing team by bumping a giant soccer ball into a goal in either 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2, 3 vs. 3, or 4 vs. 4 matches against AI or human competitors. In a very cool move, Psyonix programmed a four-player, split-screen local multiplayer mode for those who want to mix it up with friends in the same room."
919,"super fun game, i enjoy it a ton

but any game with a random lootbox system and microtransactions automatically deserves to get 0% positive reviews. doubly so when it also forces you to use another party to sign in."
920,Just amazing game
921,"A really fun game that actually has a skill ceiling to work towards, and the improvement at which doesn’t feel like it is making future loses feel more soul crushing (like is the case with most FPS competitive games)

Tho having had originally bought this game prior to it going FTP. I had done so in hopes of getting to know better somebody. Somebody that ended up being a total douch bag the more me and everybody else got to know them for. 

I had really spent money on getting a game I was neither good at nor were I enjoying, just in hopes of becoming better friends as we shared many friends in common. But after countless invitations to play and becoming friends, their silence spoke more words than they ever did. 

 I am happy I ended up meeting new and old friends who play this game, which ended up overriding what this game used to remind me of, for which I am grateful, as waiting for lucioball to make a return in the coming years."

Ben do you like Rocket league?
YES🐶
as you can see Ben also likes rocket league so do I.

962,"A very fun action/arcade/sports game with very tight gameplay.  My one big complaint is that the in-game tutorial really doesn't prepare you for the advanced skills players develop.  Sure, there are 'drills', but no real help for what one should actually be doing despite the game being very opinionated about how to do complex aerials.

A second minor complaint is that the user base is extremely toxic.  No matter how reasonable your mess-up is that allowed a goal, teammates and opponents alike will bombard you with sarcastic 'What a save!' quick-chats and such.

I guess a third is that more map diversity would be nice.  Most of the maps are just simple rectangles.  There's all of four that are anything but simple reskins of that basic design.  And two of those four make for bad gameplay."

977,"This game is but a shell of what it used to be. It is now full of server lag that the devs won’t fix and won’t listen to the community. The player base is primarily toxic until you get into the higher ranked matches where people actually are there to have fun. If you accidentally demo someone and say sorry, they will most likely chase you around and blow you up and make it unenjoyable. Taunting is a huge thing, and so is players who don’t rotate or learn how to actually play. Until they fix the servers and the toxic players do not download."

993,"Car football is a fun concept. In terms of a multiplayer game where you slowly climb the ranking ladder, this game is perhaps the most satisfying to improve at, as each improvement is usually a clear new mechanic you're capable of doing, and therefore feels less frustrating to play over long periods of times than other multiplayer games."

1011,I played this game waaay back in 2015. Im still not Supersonic Champion but im good enough to say that i can recommend this game to anyone who is determined enough to give it a chance. At first you are going to suck yeah but trust me...the time and effort you put in will be worth it. The biggest problem i had was ranked with randoms. They always expect you to save everything and make every shot perfect and if you fuc it up they will insult you immediately. That is something most gamers should be used to nowadays. Apart from that the game is very good.
1012,Is good game.

1101,"Car + Soccer = Soccar. Delightfully Simple, yet intrinsically complicated. If you give this game enough time, it will leave you wanting to play game after game. To quote a Civilization quote, Just.. One.. More.. Game..(Instead of turn) This game is insanely competitive and nearly as addictive. The monetization is worse than it use to be and gets a F- from me. I'm no advocate of loot boxes, but back when it had it, you'd spend 20$ on 20 random items. Now its strictly priced. 5$, 10$ and 20$, and possibly more if the item is specially colored. Picked up in 2015, and am still an avid player."

1226,"The game used to be good, before it became F2P. Now it is full of smurfs and that just doesn't make the game fun anymore. There is no more fun, balanced matches, either you walk over your opponents (who are actually your own rank) or you get messed up by smurfs that are mechanical gods in both offense and defense, but more than certainly DO NOT belong in your current rank. Grinding for a higher rank can only happen if you queue up with a higher ranked mate on a smurf. Investing hours and hours of training doesn't pay off. Playing for an entire evening and MAYBE you end up ONE DIVISION above what you started with, it just isn't rewarding at all - usually you end up at the same rank or possibly even lower than that. Perhaps if they decide to implement something as a smurf queue or make you rank up faster if you win a set amount of games in a row, I will return. But for now, uninstalling."

1350,"It feels kinda silly to review this game on Steam since it's no longer available on this platform, but if you just want to know about the game in general, I definitely recommend it for a fun (though often frustrating) time.

The game's main modes are exactly what they look like, car soccer. It sounds simple, but getting good at the game's mechanics can take many hours just to feel okay with. Mastering stuff like being able to do aerials requires dedication.

But even if you're a more casual player, Rocket League is still a good time with friends or with just random players from the game's very active online scene. If you care about stuff like rankings, you'll be annoyed a lot having to deal with losses that aren't your fault and teammates who just don't gel with you. It's best not to take the game too seriously to avoid the aggravation.

It also has a lot of fun alternate modes, like being able to change the size or physics of the ball, doing basketball or ice hockey modes, and various limited time modes that will pop up like a football themed mode. Rocket League is a fun way to get in a quick gaming session if you only have like 10 or 15 minutes to kill, but it can also be nice to put a couple hours into for the night if you want to do something like a tournament.

Ignore the hostile feedback from a lot of people in the game's chat and just have fun playing the game. 9/10 for me"

1360,Since the Jan update of 2022 this game has started stuttering every single game I play. Fun to play but this stutter has made the game literally unplayable for me.
1361,yo fuck this game
1362,Ready to smell and never shower again than this game is right for you.
1363,I like to play this.
1364,"Its fun and competitive car soccer with a huge learning curve. Writing this review after a ban when i said a bad word not even in context with anything, in a ""private"" team chat none the less (my teammate did not report me). The ban was delayed till of course im winning in the middle of tournament. NEVER SPENDING MONEY ON THIS GAME AGAIN.

1388,"League of legends is a toxic game, I would not recommend. 0/5 stars.

However, Rocket League is an amazing game, filled with rich lore and versatile characters. The deep character arc and plot sequences really enthrall me to keep playing the game no matter how gruesome the quests can become. This is amazing for those who love MMO RPGs like World of Warcraft, Club Penguin, and Fortnite. What a terrific installment to the halls of the gaming archives, we were bestowed upon a blessing the day this League of Rockets came to be.

Glory to Christ, Amen. 

Rocket League gets a 5/5! What a great MMO RPG."

1392,game sucks would recommend
1393,Car soccer with flight mechanics. Big bet. Lots of fun. 10/10 will dribble again.
1394,This game leads you on a path of self-discovery that inevitably ends up into the vortex of despair and self-criticism as you're slowly realizing you're not underranked champ - you're just plain trash. 10/10 would recommend!
1395,I get bullied at this game constantly
1396,"Rocket League is an awesome G-rated game for all ages. I play with a group of older men in their 50s in a club called AARP ""The Gereatric Wall Crawlers"" and we exclusively play the hockey version of the game ""Snow day"" and it's amazingly good fun. The puck has much different physics than the game's ""Soccar"" ball and it makes for the matches to be a little bit faster pace than the normal game. I love Rocket League and would recommend it to anybody who likes to jump up in their chair and cheer anytime they score a shot. This game gets intense and the tournaments are no joke. If you want to get good at it I suggest LOTS of practice."
1397,"Don't know what went wrong during development, but this is not a game.

This is a time machine that warps you to 3am."
1398,so awful but loads of fun
1399,"After well over a 1k hours between console and PC, back when the game cost money, this is by far the best competitive game I have ever played. This is mainly due to the fact that there is no meta, it is all the skill of the sport. I am nowhere as good as I want to be, but I love that there is always progress to be made and skills to be honed or learned. The most difficult game to get used to and even harder to master, but every goal feels just as good as the first, if not better. 
Everything that is for purchase is for display only, and has no effect on gameplay except to flex. I was upset when they switched from crates to blueprints, which felt like a money grab at first. But you earn so many skins/whatnot that it feels like anything you buy is strictly preference. You earn so much by just playing, I haven't spent a dime since purchasing the game (which is now free, obviously). I can't tell you enough how much I love this game. I have never played a game for as long as I've played this. If you are unsure, try it.
It took me about a month to be able to hit the ball how I wanted, when I wanted (mostly). But every time you hit the ball in a new way you have been practicing or perfecting, the endorphines are the same. I will definitely play this game until it dies or I do. Fantastic experience 10/10 easy."

1429,"This game is very fun, on one condition. You can not turn into a capital G Gamer.
It is a game where you play football by driving a car. If you accept this absurd world around you and do not fall into the trap of becoming a competitive husk of yourself, there is a kind of meditative fun to be had. Turn off all in game communication to clear your mind as you drive around, alone or with your friends, build an intuitive sense of controlling the ball. 
The game and its obsessed inhabitants become your Samsara, your never ending wheel of rebirth and suffering, and through rigorous self control and mental ascetism you are able to trancend the competitive nature that binds your Gamer companions to their torment of their rank and their team.  

A potentially spiritual experience."

New UI feels like a mobile game.

1513,its really dope
1514,"Started playing from 2015, I was just a kid and didn't really understand the game but just played for fun, before I knew it I was grinding like crazy.
Takes a lot of time and hard work to master but definitely one of the best games in the past years.
Go download it I really recommend."
1515,Im bad
1516,See ball hit ball
1517,(👍≖‿‿≖)👍 👍(≖‿‿≖👍)
1518,"stinky game dont get , i payed money for this shit a week before it came free, thanks epic games suck my balls"
1519,"I love getting victory royals in this game, and the boss fights are crazy! Elden Bing is definitely the best board game out there!"
1520,Fixes everything broken with soccer and the NFL
1521,"I think the best thing about this game is that you can be absolutely trash or a try hard but it's still fun either way, you're not really gonna get flamed if you're just playing casually and that's the best."
1522,Just Play It
1523,I stare at photos of my father crying every night because of this game. 10/10.... It's been 26 years it doesn't take that long to get milk and cigarettes.
1524,"puts you in a game in a region where you have high ping, are 2-0 down, and your team mates suck, then bans you from playing when you quit the match.

"
1525,epic sucks.
1526,"Great Game i have been playing it for like 6 years and i love it <3
"
1527,Very Good game spend a lot of time of this game
1528,Best game ever <3
1529,good
1530,Yes
1531,had this since 2015
1532,the best racing sport hybrid of all time
1533,
1534,++
1535,Rocket League is a game that is truly one of a kind. No matter the time that passes it will always have a place in my heart for the times spent grinding mechanics or playing with friends were the most fun I've ever had. Hopefully people can enjoy it for many more days to come :D
1536,Great game for anyone interested in football/soccer and cars.
1537,"noice game, buy if you want to sell you're soul"
1538,"Before I played this I had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
1539,Half my teammates are from 3rd world countries and have 200+ ping and are brain dead not fun
1540,car goes vroom
1541,moved to epic games
1542,"When I bought it it was an awesome experience. Since the game went free to play it ruined the competitiveness given that there are lots of people making new smurf accouns obviously for free, and no one takes responsability for it either in Psyyonix or Epic Games (new store who bought the rights). Also there are shitty updates with lots of bugs, and no consistency in perfomance between different new maps compared to the old ones. Anyway I miss the old experience. Is now frustrating to play, takes away most of the fun."
1543,Challenging Yet fun game alone or with friends. definitely check this one out.
1544,this game sucks
1545,Cars Go Brrrr
1546,Great Game!
1547,the best
1548,car go fly REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
1549,.
1550,Car goes brum I go This is Rocket League!
1551,"7 years later and this game still has an active player base, that should tell you everything you need to know, incredibly fun, even better with friends, and a fresh experience compared to call of duty #473 or every other fps game ever"
1552,"The game play is unique and so fun! For the competitive people out there, the skill ceiling is insane. Highly recommend, I've been playing for over 5 years now."
1553,well been playing a wile not something you learn in a day or a month but you will get there
1554,"awesome
"
1555,cracked af

1557,It's okay.
1558,garb game
1559,"great game. difficult to learn but very fun once you do. toxic community, but you can disable chat and just enjoy playing with your teammates or friends
"
1560,i don't like sports or car racing based games but this game is a different outcome it completely changed my opinion absolutely worth it.
1561,nice
1562,Shit game.
1563,Nice game.  Fun.
1564,zzxcvbn bvcxzxcvbnbvcxzxcvbn nbvcxzxcvbvcxzzxcvbvcxzxcvbn
1565,GOD
1566,maybe
1567,"Best sports game ever, despite Epic's attempts to ruin it since they bought Psyonix. 

The entire economy of this game is trash, now; $20 for a skin that you can only use on one car is just utterly ridiculous. Convoluted and tedious trade mechanics aren't much better. 

But the game itself is still pure kinetic energy, and a lot of fun, and no sports game I've ever played has been nearly as thrilling as the moments this game, at its best, can deliver."
1568,IT HAS BIG BALLS
1569,"horrible community. i was here since the original season 2 and it was much more enjoyable. this game has a different atmosphere now. not the game's fault, but the community that plays it."
1570,"It's like football (soccer), but with cars. What's not to love?

Sucks that it went F2P after buying 4 copies for me and my friends, but oh well."
1571,trash game that takes up most of your life.... 1000/10 would not recommend.
1572,Every time i play the game i cant hear game sounds because the voices in my head are too loud
1573,pretty good
1574,Why the fuck do i need an epic games account for something I've owned for literally years?
1575,Cars go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
1576,"this game is so trash. ive had it since it game out ok. People will chase balls like literal dogs. When you call them idiots they cry like little kids lmao. Imagine reporting someone in a game for beeing told to fuck off hahaahaahahhahahah
weak minded dogs. no wonder you get fucked IRL. If u are a man this game is not for you lmao"
1577,"det bare fed
"
1578,"its fun
"
1579,Is Alrigh.
1580,i like
1581,gaem goode
1582,"Yet another Epic Games Store exclusive nobody asked for. While I did not play while it was still officially listed on Steam, I have a feeling it was much better then, as stated in other reviews. Playing this now, I often get teams of either kids who don't have any idea what they're doing or bots. Pretty much the same thing. And I get penalized for leaving by clicking leave or going idle, while people clearly intentionally leave through other methods (probably disconnecting their internet) regularly. Psyonix sold their soul to the devil."
1583,shit game
1584,Fire
1585,this game trash no cap kekw cringe sad
1586,Good game i guess
1587,there are no rockets.... sad
1588,shit
1589,this game sucks
1590,"best game out there hands down
"
1591,I'll get you PERRY
1592,"This game is ok, but the developers are sad excuse for developers. The like to abuse people at will and ban people when ever they feel like as if they are some kind of government system. 

Don't get into this game and use your time more wisely playing something that does not allow them to abuse good paying customers."
1593,cream.
1594,fun game
1595,I have been playing since 2015 and this game never gets old for me.
1596,Fun game
1597,HJB
1598,fucking shirt ganme
1599,car soccer is best.
1600,"Nice Game! Easy to learn, but hard to master!"
1601,"Is Rocket League still relevant? Do people still play this game? Who knows? Who cares?

I had fun with this little league soccer-vehicle game! Honestly I wish more people played it so I could get on and have a ball! Worth a buy if you like car games and sports games! Or if you like / have played Crossout!"
1602,nice
1603,g
1604,finally get the broom out of your ass!!!! and then dear rl team fix your ranked matchmaking system. I have no more desire to match with such underprivileged silver 2 mates in c1 - c2. how did these mf's get up there? But the main thing is to keep bringing skins to the shop? get fucked with your bitch ass yee yee ass goofy ass looking titanium white cars.
1605,this is a really good combination for a game. Just wish it had more updates which brings more modes
1606,"?

1613,"It's pure fun once you get decent mechanics. Before then, it feels both fun and frustrating."
1614,this game litty magitty
1615,"good game
"
1616,"Ethernet required, game does not work properly on WiFi or imperfect connections, slightest variations in ping (we're talking going between 50-80) make the game unplayable."
1617,nice
1618,very good game - but you cannot get on steam anymore :(
1619,Its rocket league and that's good
1620,flying cars is fun
1621,"ball go crazy
"
1622,pretty epik
1623,"this game used to very fun. its not anymore. the matchmaking is awful, the community is cancer, its shoving microtransactions down your throat, i don't like this game anymore. you get punished for other people leaving matches or sitting idle. the toxicity of the children that chat in this game is amazing. whether via voice or text, you cannot assume you are communicating with a sane human, and Psyonix is probably supporting it. its a shame i paid money for this so long ago."
1624,car go vrooooooooommm pop pop
1625,Fun game. love it
1626,Physics.
1627,only download if you want to play competitive. Want to play casual? Good luck. Toxic players and tryhards who are hardstuck diamond play casual
1628,balls

1641,Rocket League is the best game ever!
1642,pog game
1643,4000 hours. Worst game. Dont play it
1644,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
1645,💀💀💀💀

1661,"It's okay, I guess"
1662,fun
1663,"i tend to gravitate toward driving games which is how i ended up with rocket league. i'm an old fart who always plays offline because i suck so bad at the game but i still enjoy the attempts. i used to get stuck on the walls a lot but with low enough settings, i can even win a game or two here and there. fast action, very nimble physics, way over my head but a real good time"
1664,switching to steam from epic games is swag
1665,spent so many hours for this shit
1666,this game makes me hate myself
1667,ya
1668,Amazing game
1669,ehhh
1670,Love the game. Very toxic community though.
1671,"Very fun once you get the hang of it, but to be honest, this is one of the most tilting game ive ever played, if you lose more than 2 games in a row your mental is completely shattered lmao."
1672,yes
1673,"i love u rocket league
"
1674,This is Rocket League !
1675,"yes,recommended all the way especially with friends it's fun enough said get it on epic games for free! ;)"
1676,"The worst servers out there of any game, rocket league is a mistake, dont waste your time, you're gonna end up endlessly browsing the internet for ""fixes"" attempting to solve and salvage your games performance, thinking its on your side, but it never was, fuck this piece of shit."
1677,"My favorite online game 
A nice workshop

"
1678,Haha cars go brrrr
1679,its a good game idk what say
1680,good game
1681,game sucks. 10/10
1682,PEW PEW CAR GO BOOM
1683,"A great game where competitiveness is everything. Refine your skills to get better and crush the competition. The music is 10/10, graphics are 10/10, and driving is 10/10."
1684,I cant live without it. omg
1685,game is fucking dogshit.
1686,fun

1688,This is Rocket League!

1690,ye
1691,Best acrobatic rocket powered flying battle car soccer game in existence
1692,"Sh*t game that bans you for 5 mins for leaving a 1v1 match early because it ""creates an unfair advantage for the other team against your teammates"". Don't recommend."
1693,This game is aids :)
1694,The first 100 hours is pretty average but then it gets good when you actually learn how to hit the ball.
1695,This is Rocket League!
1696,"The first 30 hours in the game seem like hell, because it's a very hard but addictive game..."
1697,"This game is good if you you want to play competitive or just relax with friends, but the skill curve is very steep if you go comp."
1698,its so cool i can fly and get trashed on by other players its super cool you will like it and hate just like yourself
1699,good game
