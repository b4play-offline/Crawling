95,"I'm not new to BR games and definetly not new to shooters so at first I thought I just need to learn the weapons and recoil better to win the 1v1 engagements. Once you get better you sometimes lose to the enemy just having better positions than you do and once you check out the deathcam you know your skill doesn't matter one bit because 70% of the times you die to aimbots. That said my next issue is that the anti cheat in in this game is non existent, that you can report the cheaters where you're 100% certain they cheat (maybe im just too bad to flickshot between 4 people and kill them all within 2 seconds with an m416 at 40m range) and even then they do not get banned or they will only get temporarily banned for a week. Since it's f2p they probably got multiple cheating accounts anyway and they dont give a damn about a temp. ban. Also atleast 20-30% of combatatants in each game are bots.

Gunplay feels fun, there's an abundance of loot (and often cars) everywhere so it doesnt mean too much if you looted your perfect gear for 10 minutes, played another 10 minutes of hiking simulator or chase the zone simulator and died to a single headshot right after reaching the action.

On the positive side you can drive around in an ice cream truck play stupid music and run over people which is enough fun to keep playing this game until super people releases and I can finally uninstall pubg for good.

I've never had so many games of someone popping around a corner and snap straight to my head and fire a couple times to kill me even tho i just hit them a crap ton already.

120,"LOVE THE GAME, BUT WOULD LIKE MORE FIGHTING, TOO MUCH RUNNING"
121,"准备购买CSGO的同学要注意下面几点！
1：最好别碰箱子【这种比运气的东西就跟赌博一样，一开根本停不下来，除非你认为你自己是个欧洲人，不然最好别去碰箱子，安安心心的去买皮肤吧！】
2：升级经验是固定的，不管你是多少级，升级都是固定的5000点。每周升级都可以随机获得一个喷漆【有次数限制】或者一把皮肤枪，不过基本都不值钱，每周只能获得一次。40级满级后可以转生，回到1级，同时会送你一个今年的服役勋章，比如你17年满级转生，就送你17年的服役勋章，简单来说这勋章就是拿来好看的。
3：平衡性，不用我说了，皮肤没有任何属性加成，所以不用担心遇到什么人名币战士。
4：CT和T都有自己阵营的特色武器，比如CT的M4A1，T的AK47。【说这个就是想吐槽我有一个萌新朋友抓着我问为什么CT买不了AK47，T买不了M4A1。说实话我可以笑他一年，23333】
5：现在到了2级就能打竞技了，并且定级赛并不是让你定级打10把，而是让你赢10把，赢了10把才算定级完成。每赢2把会冻结你的竞技模式，无法打竞技，这是以你赢的两把的战绩还有之前输的几把比赛帮你测评你的水平，冻结时间结束后才能继续打竞技。定级完成后你才可以随心所欲的打竞技了！
6：一定要小心一些陌生人，有些心怀不轨的人会加你好友给你发链接，这个时候别去点链接，也别信那些人说的我用XXX元买你刀啊皮肤之类的，这些家伙们都不是什么好人。【提这个是因为在贴吧里不止一次看到有人被骗了。】
7：现在CSGO分两种服务器，国服和国际服，国服目前在18号前没有激活码是没法玩的，激活码自己去百度搜索CSGO完美官网去抢，国服和谐有点严重，血变成石油了，恐怖份子变成了****和谐符号等等。对于国际服玩家，VPN的话我比较建议网易UU和奇游。国际服玩家想转国服的话，跟DOTA2转国服一样，鼠标右键游戏点击属性，在属性页面选择【设置启动选项】，在启动选项中输入—perfectworld steam，确定，然后就可以玩国服了，不过国际服玩家没有激活码也是没办法在18号前进行匹配的。[10.2]这次CSGO更新后，好像打开游戏是让我们自行选择哪个服务器，可以选择国服也可以选择国际服，如果有什么遗漏的欢迎留言补充，这也是我最后一次更新评测了吧。
8:[8.5]最近V社在封中国饰品网机器人，导致中国玩家损失惨重，所以第八条建议，最好是等这次风波过后再用。还是那句话，理性消费才是关键。
最近混了混饰品交易网，饰品交易网主要还是看信誉，不清楚的萌新可以去问问百度贴吧的老哥们，饰品交易网最深的坑就是类似于赌博性质的“抽奖”，这抽奖很容易亏钱，相信有些氪金老哥很清楚的，交易网用来提现或者买枪都可以，但是我不建议去花钱“抽奖”，非常坑，真的非常坑。【7.30】因为某饰品交易网的事情搞得很多人被坑，因为我早就不玩饰品了，就不予评价，不过不是这次事件，某网的黑点也够多的，比如以前被串号转库存这些事情不少有，不过这次更新不说这个，这次我想教下萌新们安全地卖皮肤：去百度贴吧，饰品交易吧把你想要卖的饰品信息挂到贴吧里，跟别人谈价，等确定买家之后走饰品网，挂好饰品后把信息告诉买家，让他买。注意一点，这个是最重点的，无论什么情况，所有交易必须都是走饰品交易网，若他非要不用交易网和你进行交易的话，请不要跟他浪费时间，这种饰品交易不走交易网还会去市场？这种人不走交易网就是想坑走你的饰品，那种“买家”会要你去其他什么狗P网站交易，然后再申诉把钱拿回来，走饰品交易网至少不会被骗，目前由于某网出了这么大的事情，肯定有萌新在思考用什么交易网，因为我出了饰品坑所以也不好说哪些，但是我们有万能的百度贴吧老哥们，萌新可以去问CSGO吧的兄弟们什么交易网可靠，记得没错的话，好像置顶帖就有教的，然后饰品交易过程，最好是越短越好，所以要先找到买家再去挂饰品交易网，十几块的皮肤不需要用我这个，但是几百块以上的最好要先找到买家，再直接挂交易网，这次某网事件我就不说什么了，最后给各位萌新留一个提醒：饰品是个大坑，切勿沉迷饰品，别因为一时冲动，吃半月尘土。
9：国服出了后，为了少点萌新被骗，我给第6条补充一下，先说说目前骗子骗人的骗法吧，基本上想买你的刀或者找你打联赛的，全都是骗子。有人以前好奇，说为什么不能点链接，我就给你们讲讲吧，这是库存链接，对于绑了手机安全令牌的还好，没绑的绝对会出事，它会把你所有库存交易给对方，手机还好可以确认是否交易，但是没绑手机令牌的同学就惨了。然后别以为有手机安全令牌就可以随便浪了，有些黑客早已经弄了个盗号网站，等着你浪呢。目前骗子最喜欢用的手法是打联赛缺人来骗你，因为是机器人自动发话，我就给你们讲讲骗子一般怎么骗人的吧。
骗子：我们联赛缺一个人，你打什么位置？
萌新：？？？
骗子：行，我知道了，你加下我们领队，她会告诉你更多。XXXX【这是库存交易链接】
这时候，只需要删除好友即可，别想着去调戏，这是电脑人不会回复你的。

146,Hackers run rampid on every game outside of casual. They outgun you with less armor and weaker weapons and know exactly where you are. Reporting only works 5% of the time. The bots lock on to people through buildings. The only maps that can give you any level playing field against hackers are Erangle and Mirimar. The weapons crafting is asking for too much and gives too little. I work a 9 to 5 job 5 days a week and this game doesn't give me enough time to progress with the 40 hours I have for free time. It's a headache and a waste of time. If you plan to play this game you better find some wall hacks or gcoin hacks otherwise you are never going to be happy with this game. I also paid for this game a month before they made it ftp and I didn't even gain a battlepass when I started. I can make a crap game in unity that makes people happier than this one.

168,"There's no way to quickly remove it from your computer without having to delete system files and removing registry lines. With no official response on how to actually completely remove Wellbia from your system you have to rely on community threads online to figure it out.

Having these files present on your computer inhibit you from using the memory integrity security feature on windows. Factoring in the huge amount of cheaters still rampant in PUBG and this being a kernel level anti-cheat there's some obvious questions popping up.

Why did they set it to be constantly running?
Why are there still leftover processes constantly running after removing it?
Why isn't there an official way to completely uninstall it?

I don't recommend downloading this for the side dish of spyware you're installing, at the end of the day it might be bad implementation but installing a game with such a huge budget behind it shouldn't end up being a potential security risk.

If you want to check if you're affected and want to know how to remove it.

1 pollo mediano con piel
1⁄2 cucharada de romero seco
1⁄2 cucharada de pimienta negra molida
1⁄2 cucharada de comino
1⁄2 cucharada de sillao
1⁄2 cucharada de orégano en polvo
1 cucharada de ajo molido
1⁄2 cucharada de ají panca molido
1⁄2 taza de cerveza negra
Sal
Mantequilla
Agua

PREPARACIÓN
Echar 4 cucharadas de sal en una olla grande con agua y mover bien.
Sumergir el pollo entero y refrigerar en salmuera por 8 horas.
Picar el romero lo más chico posible y echarlo en un bol.
Agregar la pimienta negra y una cucharadita de sal. Añadir el comino, el sillao, el orégano, el ajo molido, el ají panca y la cerveza negra. Mezclar y rectificar la sal. Reservar esta marinada.
Sacar el pollo de la refrigeradora, escurrirlo y colocarlo en un bowl limpio.
Bañarlo con la marinada. Procurar introducir la mezcla entre la piel y la carne. Tapar el bowl con papel film y dejarlo reposar por al menos ocho horas más con la pechuga hacia abajo. Darle la vuelta un par de horas antes de sacarlo.
Transcurrido el tiempo, colocar el pollo en una bandeja o fuente para horno y pincelarlo con mantequilla por encima y dentro de la piel.
Cocinarlo en el horno a 270 ºC por 90 minutos (o 120 minutos si el pollo está muy frío).
Pasados los primeros 40 minutos, bañarlo con el jugo que quedó de la marinada. Girar la bandeja 3 o 4 veces durante la cocción para que se cocine parejo.
Volver a pincelar con mantequilla derretida unos 20 minutos antes de sacarlo. Mirar constantemente. Sacarlo del horno antes de que la piel empiece a dorarse demasiado o quemarse."

189,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

A shooter that’s as invested in creating a smart, nuanced survival experience as it is fun, action-packed combat.

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds has taken the military-sim gameplay popularized by games like ARMA and DayZ, boiled it down to its most exciting parts, and streamlined it into quick and accessible rounds of pure, hassle-free, survival-based action. Even though each game starts the same way, its remarkable ability to feel like a new, tense adventure each and every round has kept me coming back for hours on end."

He is a lvl 500 cheater and probably has been cheating for a while. I left the game for good. Surely I reported him but probably nothing will happen, and even if happens I won't know and will be facing another cheater in the future.

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of 4 week he had 89 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

298,"After nearly 3,300 hours of gameplay... 
I have decided this game is NOT FUN to play. 

Someone else mentioned this game is like dating an alcoholic. I'd say it's more like being the alcoholic. It's not really that good, but the effect is such a high, it gets you hooked pretty easily. It lets you do all kinds of crazy stuff, but eventually you're not even thinking anymore and you realize you don't remember what you did 30 minutes ago let alone after staying up until 3AM playing it, only because the playercount starts dropping around 2AM. You wake up the next day and feel like shit because you got shitty rest, probably would've been better off doing something productive, or almost anything else at all, and you can't think of anything valuable it actually contributed to your life. You say you'll never do it again, but sure enough, the next night, there you are again, in the same spot, bottle in hand, sitting by yourself in an alleyway behind the bar, vomit down your front, crying about the girl you met a couple hours ago who said she was going home with you but is nowhere to be found. :( You say ""thiz shit iz ztoopiddd..."" and pass out. Wake up on the couch in your living room, reeking of booze and bile, negative balance in your bank account, and already 2 hours late to work.... 

Don't waste your time on this game."

Now every game you get into is either sweaty and ultra-competitive, or you get killed by a cheater who watched you from miles away. No more fun or casual gameplay, like the older days. Reporting them is futile, you know they won't get banned or anything. Absolutely insane downfall. Not worth it in any way. Free-to-play ruined this game."

PUBG is meant for those who are really into the 'realistic' vibe of battle-royale gaming. It's built very differently than compared to most other battle-royale games out there and it is considerably lightweight when it comes to storage capacity. It can often get annoying as you die to people who are drastically more competent than you in the field as it is still considered as a competitive game. It gets even better with friends!"

366,"Good game, always improving and new content."
367,"Hackers/cheaters everywhere!!!! From aimboting, wall hacking, speed-reving, radar hacking, etc...you name it, they're everywhere. Yes I get that hackers are inevitable in online fps gaming, that's just unfortunate, but the sad part is when the devs don't even care or feel the need to do anything about it. Sure, you can report them but I highly doubt they even take it seriously. Just this past week, nearly every round I played has hackers using aimbot/norecoil script. Some of them are discrete while others are blatantly cheating in your face.. aka headshot through the fking wall. And honestly, it’s gotten to the point where the game is becoming pretty much unplayable and unenjoyable. It’s absurd.

Additionally, aside from the cheating, there's also a ridiculous amount of bugs in the game mechanics. So many times I lost a match all because of the bugs in the program (shots not hitting enemy, character getting stuck underground, vehicle flipping randomly, and worst of all, game keeps CRASHING RANDOMLY). Like seriously, this game is so unfinished and miles away from ever being considered as a polished game. The only reason I am playing is because it's free, I would NEVER spend real money on this crap. And seems like every update nowadays is only to roll out new skins for purchase, NEVER TO FIX THE BUGGY PROGRAMMING AND HACKER PROBLEM…just goes to show HOW MUCH the devs care about this game besides profit--NADA.

So yeah, I full-heartedly DO NOT recommend this game to anyone, unless they attempt to fix the bugs and cheating problem. But this is something that's been going on for quite some time and if they are going to do something about it, they would have done so already. So at this point, this game is pretty much a lost cause. And if that still isn’t enough of a wake up call to them, I am betting that not soon from now, this game will be featured on Youtube called “Death of a Game: PUBG”, sequel to ""Death of a Game: H1Z1""

This game supposed to be the hardcore, military battle royale, and yet you can have onesies to wear. After every game you will get notifications about something, something new you just earned, a new logo for your name-tag, a new charm to your weapon. Did the game really need all of these? To fight against people in the most ridiculous sets of skins ever? And the game really pushes you to get some as well. Also worth to mention that if you didnt play the game for long and just would come back, you will get some premium currency and such (because the game became free meanwhile), and you can only use it up for 1 day, not kidding, only 1 day."

Picked it back up in 2022. Guys, this game is fun and better than ever. 

I see a lot of negative reviews, but consider this
1. Free to play
2. No pay to win, literally all purchases are cosmetic only
3. No skill-based matchmaking (though I see some of you reviewers complaining thatpros and noobs get matched together. CoD gets sh*t all the time for SBMM, and here you don't have it, deal with it and git gud, EARN your chicken dinner like the rest of us. Also, competetive ppl seem to be in FPP, play TPP if you want easy mode)
4. Queue for lobbies is fast 
5. Vehicle physics is improved so you don't die or do barrel rolls from the tiniest rock now
6. Plenty of weapon, customization, and map options.

Yeah, there are some bots in the game, but those are mostly all killed within first few mins of the game and don't really have a major impact other than being able to laugh at your friends if they get killed by one

Oh, I do very much miss Duos though, removing that sucks."

Hadn't played since the January update, and it's hilarious as someone with 1000+ hours in the game to be unable to queue against other players until I complete a tutorial and 10 AI matches. Definitely not worth coming back to if you're a returning player from years ago."

500,it fun game
501,"Better than that other anime crap fortnite
"
502,This should be renamed to Sniper simulator
503,"This game is like dating an alcoholic. They're a lot of fun to be around, and you legitimately like them. But they have serious problems that ruin the whole relationship. You keep thinking they'll change, but they never will. Instead they'll just try to sell you an Event Pass to see parts of their body."
504,"Many bugs

513,YEAH BOY
514,been playing since 2014. Why can't I move on to other games?
515,"Newbies get paired with pros, that's the only problem I have about this game, but aside that, it's not as bad as the reviews. Probably it used to be, but for now, I have not seen much of hackers.

Ive uninstalled & re installed the game 4 times, computer reset. No luck. So heres my negative review. But will say the fighting, guns, & all game is better then Fortnite."

524,"Pretty epic.
Taiwan #1!"
525,"Too many hackers... clocked in over 1000 hours on this game still haven't seen improvement. They clearly don't care, doesn't seems like the banning system is stopping anyone. This is suppose to be a difficult game and that's why I enjoy it... seems like the company is allowing hackers just so they will populate the game. At this point i lost all hope for PUBG. Great idea, great game play, extremely poor management with hackers. Don't bother spending 30min in a round building up to the last circle and just to get sprayed by a no-recoil machine gun spraying from a car 200m away. Very disappointing."
526,goob
527,"crap map rotation, crap matchmaking, constant crashes and rubber banding. looting and gun fights are cool but F me this game hasn't improved. just keep adding pay to win and cosmetics to buy ffs.

now after the update its worse. just Erengal.  8 matches on the beta level, 2 mathes on different levels. broken.

535,"I am way to late to the party, but it is quite fun."
536,"There's barely anything enjoyable in this game compared to other BR's. Movement speed is slow and clunky, TTK is instant, you have to travel 500 km to the next zone while everyone camps bridges or other things that basically is there just to F you over. Most people even keep hiding in zones to make sure YOU do not get out of there alive even if it means that they won't be able to escape. Healing is damn annoying because you can't even heal yourself to max without these stupid energy cans or painkillers so if you get attacked shortly after you've dealt with someone so is it over for you. The game is also overrun by bots, or at least that what it feels like. Some of them legit just keep running into walls or just stand there looking at you not even shooting back. I thought this game had a healthy player base why the need of these cringe bots? I came here to play against real players not this kindergarten warfare BS.

P.S 99% of my hours are around the time when the game first gained popularity and the game was fine back then because there really wasn't any  alternatives out there and there  were ZERO  bots"

551,its a fun game once you get to a decent skill level but they seem to keep missing the mark with the battle passes. nothing they have released in the battle passes have been remotely interesting and the new one isn't exactly making me want to buy it. Give me a WW2 event or vietnam! not cars and school girls
552,Awesome
553,"This game is utter shit. Ping issues desync issues and hackers all around. Dont waste your precious time folk's much better things to play. On top of that, after paying $50 for this game when it launched its now FREE TO PLAY!? WTF that is fraud and highway robbery right there!"
554,"if you like fortnite or War zone, this is for you!"

565,there is no building
566,Everyone is a level 500 player that has spent a little to much time in the game unfortunately. I have not bought a single G-Coin and it seems like the odds are stacked against me in every match. The game feels rigged by the Chinese government to benefit the players who purchase G-Coin.

581,"Five years after its release, the game is still being played. I would say that it is even more popular since it became free to play. For me, PUBG brought the definition of battle royale to the gaming world. The development team regularly adds new content to make the game even better. Recommendation"
582,yes yes VERRY MUCHHHH !!!
583,"ok
"
584,Great game!
585,I just play it for the jumping out of plane part
586,"with 20 ping , id play this 24/7"
587,"PUBG! The one and only game that somehow requires bots to fill lobbies despite having constantly high player counts. Characterised by Level 500 sweats dunking on you, or massively padded stats due to the worst AI ever, this game will provide endless self hate that manages to compel you into giving PUBG your wallet. 
To be fair, the game is incredibly fun. Until I played PUBG, I hadn't played a game that racked up playtime this fast since the launch of R6S or Apex Legends. It's satisfying despite the arguably clunky movement system, it feels rewarding to get high kill games even in bot lobbies, and it's just an all round fun experience."
588,"If only this game has little to no cheaters, this is by far the most skill-based raw battle royale game that you can play on. No extra gizmos just pure civilian to civilian survival game that would test your tactical capabilities, decisions, and gun handling."

599,"- You start a duo match
- Your teammate leaves because you are not level 500
- You leave the match because you don't want to play alone
- You finally found a teammate that won't leave
- You get killed by level 500 player
- You decide to play ranked for a fair matchmaking
- You discover ranked is locked until you buy PUBG premium
- Repeat step 1 - 5

10/10 Highly recommended"
600,Nu imi place👍!
601,"After purchasing the game for full retail price before it went F2P and putting over 1800 hours into the game and a bit more for in-game purchases as well, the company has seen fit to permanently ban me without warning and at first, without reason.

I broke no rules, policies, TOS, or ROC they have.  I went through their 'ban appeals' process which is pointless as they do not look into the issue at all.  I spoke with a couple of different representatives in the appeals process and finally got a reason that they believe I used ""unauthorized programs"" which is certainly not true and I offered to assist them in any way possible with looking into this false positive.  They would not.  They have no interest in bettering their product for their consumers apparently, to prevent false bans.

Hindsight is 20/20 now but if you look at forums across the internet, this seems to be a common thing with PUBG and their company.  Not the usual insincere ""I'm banned for no reason"" posts as in other games/platforms, but a legitimate issue with the company randomly permanently banning legitimate people.  The PUBG community understands this and just rolls with it and tells those users to 'just create a new Steam account' because PUBG is F2P now.   This is ridiculous for people that want to follow the rules and use their true and only Steam account.

I have tried to go through their normal means for appealing and discussing with the company and they would not assist.  If they do decide to finally look into this issue, I will update/edit this if I can.

I cannot recommend anyone to put in any effort or money or to play this game as legitimate players will be at risk of being permanently banned, which in turn leaves a permanent mark on your overall Steam account causing friends/others to question you."
602,its just having so much updat :((

625,This game's graphics have improved dramatically and the game is vibrant but my only complaint is being paired with extremely high level players which ends the game prematurely for me I mean I just started playing this game. I just see a level 500 and then I am like this isn't fair! its is not that bad though I just wish I could get more kills but the game is fairly easy to learn I love it just stick with your teammates and help out.
626,cheaters
627,"This game changed my life.

Let me start at the beginning. When I was in the third grade, I was constantly bullied by all the other kids in my school. They would call me mean names like 'Titty boy', and 'Stinky'. I got so depressed that I decided to just stay in my bed all the time. My mother used to come into my room and beat me with an iron spatula to try and get me to move. I never knew my father...

Six years later and I finally decided it was time for a change. I went back to school and rejoined the third grade, but this time it was worse. I was so much older than all the other kids and no one wanted to be my friend, not even the teacher. One day, during recess, they told me to stand by the school wall and they took turns throwing rocks at me. I suffered severe brain damage and had several broken ribs. 

Later that year my mother died. Before she passed away on her death bead, she told me one thing. And I honestly don't remember what it was. 

I had to move in with my uncle and I dropped out of school once again. My uncle had an old ratty laptop laying around that he used to let me play solitaire on. I loved the digitized movement of the cards so much that I decided to steal my uncles money from his safe and buy a real gaming computer. 

Fast forward ten years and I was officially a master at every video game I touched. Then I discovered this little indie title called ""Player Unknown's Battle-Grounds"". From that moment on everything changed. My mother and father came back to life, all the third graders in my old class came forward and apologized to me. Even my teacher!

I now live happily in a mansion with my seven wives, twelve super-cars, and billions of dollars. 

Thank you PUBG, I will be forever grateful to you.

631,"The game is very enjoyable , but beware getting to it is very hard. Theres a huge level difference with players sadly there isnt divided levels between a level 1 to a level 500, When you start the game you will start against level 500s and against really sweety good players, so itll be hard to start but none of the less the game has great graphics , and great guns machanices that are very enjoyable."
632,been playing PUBG since 2017. Started out on Xbox then switched to PC march of this year (2022). has its ups and downs but will forever be the GOAT of battle royale games

"
647,Beautyfull game
648,Great game with Friends.
649,"I mean, I 've been playing this game almost since it got released. Lots of hours wasted, lots of fun stuff have happened in PUBG's battlegrounds. Unfortunately, I will have to say that it's one of the best battle royals in the market, that focuses on gun-play, and not on building mechanics, or magic spells or whatever. That says a lot, because ...

On the downsides, the game has a lot of cheaters, even with the 3-4 anti-cheats they have added into the game. Bugs and crashes are not uncommon, even on high-end rigs. For a new player, up to level 80, you will face mostly bots on your games - and there is nothing you can do about it. Finally, the company is extremely greedy, which is reflected upon their market, that is filled with overpriced digital clothing and skins, that many of them are not even marketable.

If you have friends to play this game, go ahead. Otherwise, stay away from it, as far as possible.

Overall I give it a nice 6/10."

702,People are right about the hackers and lvl 500 only people. After a match of getting head shot from behind a tree out of view I couldn't connect to the server and couldn't use steam. had to restart my computer. One of my favorite games to play ruined. Game is unplayable now

This is insulting to players who already know how to play the game. Definitely a bad move for the game. If the devs remove this from the game, I'll edit my review."
707,A lot of hackers.
708,"If you like going against lvl 500 sweats , even in casual mode, this game is for you!"
709,.
710,"PUBG was a fantastic game in a vacuum. When there were no comparable BRs, it reigned supreme in being fun and replayable despite its clunky mechanics. Fast forward to current times however and games such as Fortnite, Apex, and Super People showcase how much better BR gameplay can be with crisp player control.

It feels a little unfair for me to not recommend this game after 200+ fun hours, but if Fortnite, Apex, or Super People existed back when I started playing PUBG, I would have jumped ship very quickly."
711,"now that the game is free to play the developers don't care if you cheat.  I don't ever cheat and this game is full of cheaters that never get banned(the game is no longer any fun at all)  (you die all the time to cheaters and the devs don't care at all).  even if they do get banned they can start a new account for free and cheat again, defeating everything about the game.   DONT PLAY PUBG IT IS FULL OF CHEATERS THAT DONT GET BANNED.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    the game was good years ago but not anymore.!!!!!!  POS GAME"
712,fuck the game
713,needs a little work but not too bad
714,"Fun, but WAY to many cheaters, and PUBG cannot, or will not, fix it."
715,its like balls love it or hate it almost everyone has it
716,"A very beautiful fighting game, but the support provided by the developer is very bad. I spent about 4 or 5 years in this game. I have 6591 playing hours, but they simply banned me from the game and they say the reason is to help another player Timing?? I asked for proof of that, they said the game policy does not allow this. How do you violate me and do not want to prove that to me.. Unfortunately, I will go looking for a game that cares about its players, unlike PUBG"

740,yes.
741,"While this game is almost 6 years old, it still has quite abit of player base, you don't have to wait long for a match to start.

Pros: 
Looter shooters are all good!
Alot older of Player base.
nice massive maps to play on.
Lots of Long range fights

Cons:
Feels like you're Playing a Running simulator.
Very few close ranges fights
for such massive maps not alot of vehicles to travel in.
very slow paced (as in gun play and looting and running is very realistic so everything feels slow.)
Rings don't hurt that much and can be out healed till last circle, leaving many people to fight from blue or not be scared to do so.
6 years old so its slowly getting faded out.

Overall i've played this game since beta and still playing it on and off when other BR's are not available etc.
i would recommend this game as it is the grandfather of all BR's and still is quite fun.

5 year medal gotten and i have to play 10 tutorial matches against bots like this until i get to play the real game again. i had 40 hours before this."
755,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Have an option to take it off. No one wants to do the training when this game has been out for more than 5 years.

Game is hard to come back to with other better titles on the market, the training is another obstacle for old players."

802,When all 100 players play fair without cheating this game is the best multiplayer shooter game ever and the most promising game ever. I would love to see the Maps and the game itself brought into the next generation.
803,"I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. It's an unbalanced divition between new players and ""I haven't slept in 6 years to be the best of the best of this game""-players. This is a problem this game has had since the beginning of time.
They tried to fix this by creating ""Casual Mode"", but even that mode failed miserably.
It can be your first game ever, and you asume that you'll meet some bots and some other new players.
Sorry to disappoint, but the chance for you as a new player to meet another new player is lower than 3%.
The chance for you to meet a Veteran PUBG player on the other hand is about 95%.

This is something they need to fix before the game is enjoyable."

854,"I fart around in this PUBG from time to time and I've always enjoyed it. I stopped seriously playing in 2018 when the *hackers* (who were apparently #1) were ruining almost every game I'd queue into. Shooting me through a mountain with a perfect headshot and screaming heinous things about my entire family in something that could only vaguely be described as English. That kind of fun stuff. 

It's not like that anymore from what I can tell. So far so good. I played H1z1 and DayZ back in the day and really liked both of those, so at the time of the initial release of PUBG it immediately felt like a big step up in spite of the issues. I'm a Modern Warfare fan also but I don't care for Warzone. Fortnite would be great, but since I'm not a fetus, It's not for me. That means this is the only Battle Royale game I mess with and I'm glad it's still alive and well. I know people think this game is terrible, and in many ways it is, but that doesn't stop it from being fun...if you like that kind of thing.


It's free and it's not pay to win. That gets my thumb up on that basis alone.

865,"There's barely anything enjoyable in this game compared to other BR's. Movement speed is slow and clunky, TTK is instant, you have to travel 500 km to the next zone while everyone camps bridges or other things that basically is there just to F you over. Most people even keep hiding in zones to make sure YOU do not get out of there alive even if it means that they won't be able to escape. Healing is damn annoying because you can't even heal yourself to max without these stupid energy cans or painkillers so if you get attacked shortly after you've dealt with someone so is it over for you. The game is also overrun by bots, or at least that what it feels like. Some of them legit just keep running into walls or just stand there looking at you not even shooting back. I thought this game had a healthy player base why the need of these cringe bots? I came here to play against real players not this kindergarten warfare BS. 

P.S 99% of my hours are around the time when the game first gained popularity and the game was fine back then because there really wasn't any alternatives out there and there were ZERO bots"

892,"Honestly, the gameplay is great and I really enjoy it more than any other battle royale which is why I have so many hours on it but ever since it was made free to play, almost every other game has people using hacks, both map hacks and aim snap hacks. And while they do get banned after getting reported, it does not stop them from creating new accounts and using hacks again, which is probably why it is at an all-time low on steam charts, so much so that they removed map selection on most servers besides Asia, which again is full of hackers. So unless this hacking issue is addressed, I believe more and more people will quit the game until there will be no one left but hackers fighting each other."
893,"I refuse to play this game any longer - when I play with friends I get EU servers with decent ping (they are in the same town as I am), but when I solo I exclusively get Asian servers with 300+ ping - why can't I choose a preferred server like before, and why don't I automatically get added to the lowest ping servers?

Done. Thanks."

1019,"You ready?! let's go!
Yeah, for those of you that wanna know what PUBG'S all about
It's like this ya'll (c'mon)

This is sixty percent bots
Forty percent lvl 500's
Forty percent Hackers
Sixty percent dying and loading back in 
And a hundred percent reason to Uninstall this game.

on a side note: Payed for PUBG when it came out, very buggy but showed promise. years later some same bugs still exist and now it switches to free to play and becomes a sellout in the most obnoxious way possible. Get these key shards to craft a key to open this box to get an item, oh did we mention its just an imprint and you need another made up currency to get that as well. oh but don't worry, you can dismantle 5 other really good items to get the one you want. oh yeah its cool tho because they gave me a skin for becoming free to play and already having the game bought before hand, gimme a break."

1023,"Got banned for literally doing nothing.

No interfering software downloaded, not even a single app open.
Did not mess with a glitch or abuse the in-game communications or anything mentioned on their site that would result in a permanent ban. 

Upon first download, played with my friends and got banned the following morning.

Very frustrating especially since its my only and main account and has now caused me to have a low trust factor in games such as CS:GO, which means that I am unable to play competitive matches."

1025,If im being honest. the game is pretty good. still getting updated. still getting new content. runs better then it did with the previous owners of pubg. all in all its only gotten better since the last time ive played. just wish the controls were a little bit smoother. thats the only downside i have with this game. the movement is kinda clunky. if you're okay with that its just like any other battle royale. fun. better with friends. give it another shot.
1026,OK!!!!
1027,"Undoubtedly this is the top 1 battlroyal in Steam, but what the fk dudes with 500 lvl and 10k hours in the game sit on low mmr, where is the balance? I didn't pay 13 bucks for a ranked game to eat sht from drunkards and factory workers."

Negative is the aggressive microtransactions"
1034,"Could use a little more optimizing but works fine on a 980.
Been playing it for years and they get rid of cheaters really fast, 
so I can say for myself that it is a really good game.
BTW: please nerf the DMRs!"

1039,"For long the devs have promised performance fixes, but the stability has only degraded further over the years. You cannot play a single match without the whole thing crashing.

1123,"[h1]The ""Anti-Cheat"" provided with this game autoruns on your computer at launch even after uninstalling it.[/h1]
There's no way to quickly remove it from your computer without having to delete system files and removing registry lines. With no official response on how to actually completely remove Wellbia from your system you have to rely on community threads online to figure it out.

Having these files present on your computer inhibit you from using the memory integrity security feature on windows. Factoring in the huge amount of cheaters still rampant in PUBG and this being a kernel level anti-cheat there's some obvious questions popping up.

Why did they set it to be constantly running?
Why are there still leftover processes constantly running after removing it? 
Why isn't there an official way to completely uninstall it?

[b]I don't recommend downloading this for the side dish of spyware you're installing, at the end of the day it might be bad implementation but installing a game with such a huge budget behind it shouldn't end up being a potential security risk.[/b]

[i]If you want to check if you're affected and want to know how to remove it.[/i]

1154,love it and worth it. try it out!!!
1155,it crushes
1156,"I have been playing this game on and off for about three years now, The concept was brilliant and the game mechanics too. However when the devs started adding all these shit features like shiny camos, keys,  key boxes, scrap coins, shirt blueprints, weapon schematics you name it, it just killed the originality of the game.  Also the 3 new maps are trash and I can never be 100% sure about the direction of the footsteps/shots which is sad when compared to COD, I have died countless times because of this. And not to even begin with the oversexualised female charecters which is f******. Bottom line PUBG is not what it used to be."
1157,A lot of people complaining about lvl 500s are just bad. Its not that bad woohooo
1158,"its like Fortnite, but not. perfect score of 5/7"
1159,i JUST LOVE THIS GAME. a LOT  of map to try out and a lot of place to spawn to get yourself cover from all your 98 enemy. It challenging and fun does not end
1160,Fun if you like dying to hackers
1161,What can I say It's PUBG the Grand Father of Battle Royales. Minus Armas BR and H1Z1. Great weapon ballistics and gun play making you feel like your in the fight. Silly moments are the best part of the game. Driving a bike with my buddy and hitting every jump possible to go FLYING!!! Love the game and it's still growing.

1210,"Dev's don't give a care about you.
""Pay for battle pass"" ""pay for skins"" ""put money in"" from day one.
If you get banned, there are very easy work around since there Isn't HWID bans. Even with battleye.
Don't waste your time. player base is slowly trending downwards.
Matches filled with bots, even in higher MMR.
There close to no consciences since its easy to use a burner account.
Go play Warzone, apex, even TABG. you'd have a better time playing those than this burning dumpster fire."

1214,I can't seem to stop playing this game in my free time from fivem. This game is the go to for me and my friends . I have been playing for years on console and pc but my steam account is sadly newer than my old PubG account so I have low play time
1215,"This game was modelled off of the original Battle Royale Gamemode in Arma II, a military sim, by Player Unknown. Fortnite realized it's success, and completely revisioned their game to be a battle royale instead of a tower defense game. It is still the most realistic battle royale game. The matches take a long time to load into. The game is fun, but you will lose games a majority of the time considering there are 100 players and you're in 1-4 player teams."

1235,"Way better games out there then this bs. played since day one loved it. got to a point where we got 5 to 10 wins daily. then new brs came out and never went back to this. Decided to give it a try again later on and its honestly fucking trash. Hell Super People thats basically a copy of this game but updated and less slow and bulky is more fun even with all the bots in the game. Im honestly surprised people still play pubg and havent transfered to super people when its far superior and more fast paced. Only problem with Super People is the lack of North American players, the servers are infested with dumb ai bots. Quit Pubg and play Super People if you want something similar if not go play freaking warzone or anything else really."

but thats about the best of it, the games either filled with cheaters, people who spend their whole life on the game, or more likely both. 
i tend too be ok at tps games and fps games but whenever i seem to drop in i get sniped by some lvl 500 guy right in the head. ive read things about the game being a breeding ground for exploiters nowadays which seems to be true, if the game had better anticheat i would probably play more, however i dont think i wanna touch the game gain"

Now it's just garbage with nostalgic memories. I don't know how I was able to play this for over 500 hours.

1333,"Vintage chocolate chip cookies

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking"

1359,"-> STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME <-
-> NEVER SUPPORT THIS DEVELOPER <-

Your account can be completely randomly banned. And VAC ban will remain on your account labeling you as a cheater even though you're honest player. There is no customer support, only bot giving you copy-paste info, basically telling you that ban is irreversible and asking you for understanding. They won't give you specific reason for ban, just a list of possible reasons, none of which is remotely close to the truth. It's so random that its scary. I can't believe that developer went for this solution and is basically slandering names of honest players that just wanted to check out their game. I'm currently fighting with them, trying to force out this irrational and harmful ban with no effect.

Just for you to have a little background, I'm gamer girl with a few games that I play from time to time with or without my friends. I downloaded PUBG because while I really like DayZ, cheaters there have ruined my experience. My friends asked me to join them and try PUBG, which I did for literally 3 hours and I've menaged to kill just one player. Next day I'm trying to play the game again and I'm banned for cheating (!!!!!) which I personally despise (!!!!!).

Technically speaking, I have very limited amount of software for work and few games on steam. There's no software that could remotely suggest any suspicious behaviour. If photoshop or avast are danger to your game, I guess you should never release it or make games in general.

Therefore I conclude that I was foully punished for something I never did, and I would never do, and now there's a VAC ban plastered on my steam account which just saddens me. What saddens me more is that there is no one to take responsibility for it or could support me in professional manner. Neither steam or developer offer any help, including providing reason why I was banned. 

Don't be fooled by F2P, never support this developer and their future games."

1416,"It was a fun game. The gun-play is wicked and squirrel-y, but occasionally slow compared to other BR type games. PUBG has plenty of guns and loadouts to build with most maps being interesting to play on, no two games are alike. Charming, but not playful, sticks to the down and dirty gritty roots, mostly.

But remember, that's past-tense because I haven't been able to actually play the game in weeks. There has been an unidentifiable condition where the software package for this game renders as un-playable and crashes unexpectedly, even AFTER deleting the game in full and reinstalling. Crashes used to be once in a blue moon, now I can't open the main menu without being presented a pop-up window stating a crash has happened with the game automatically closing out. I've sent several crash reports to Krafton recently, and over the years and not once seen anything come out of it.

For what it's worth, let's put the Developers on blast here for the fact that they haven't cared about fixing the most common, hard issues with the software (i.e. unexpected crashing, delayed damage, etc.) in years. It's hard to want to be part of community discussions/surveys since they have ignored almost every input by the community and only ""fix"" the most benign issues or overtly ignored them for gimmicky add-ons and systems nobody uses in-game (mortars and spotter's sight anyone?) to try to lure in new players.

TO KRAFTON, stop adding maps, guns, features and skins for a SINGLE season and FIX the basic things that are plaguing your player base and focus on player retention, not getting new players.

I'll gladly change this rating and edit this review seeing a fix come of this. For now, try another BR and let Krafton feel the struggle until they get their act together."
1417,good
1418,good
1419, Most realistic Military game I ever played. Been a gamer for 30 years...Remember pong!!!
1420,I paid for this game when it was in early access. Never had an issue. Game goes free to play. Having a big issue.  I just returned after months from playing Tarkov & Hunt: Showdown. My account has just been banned. LOL

1428,"not bad,"
1429,"i paid about $30 for this game, only to still be locked out of things that should be included in a paid game, like the ability to play ranked locked behind a paywall to the game. there is so many things in this game that are locked behind spending more and more money on it, and you still have to spend money to get what you should have gotten out of paying for the game."
1430,"Fun with friends,but the game have lags and freezes !"
1431,"I started on Xbox with this game even upgraded my Xbox just to play it, back then the older Xbox's would not process fast enough. Game has come a long way and the updates keep coming Good job! Wish that casual mode was more then 3 games a day (I'm still learning Keyboard and mouse movement). But the game is still challenging and the hacks don't seem super prevalent I like it."

1439,"DO NOT ADD THIS GAME TO YOUR LIBRARY! THEY ARE THIEVS AND LIERS!!! GOT PERMA BANNED!!! REPUTATION RUINED!

I haven't even finished the tutorial and I got perma banned. I have played 2 games against bots, one I won the second died in a car and that was like 2 days ago. Yesterday I only started up the game, decided not to play it and turned it of. Today I wake up to a permanent ban.

So now I will have to back and forth and waste time with some asain/indian bumbaka tech support nerd to get by ban removed. I had to make space for this game on my precious precious C: drive only to get banned after playing 2 games against bots. At least I have some space now. 

But thanks to their spyware shitty false flagging anti cheat I am going to be treated as a cheater. And I have no cheat software installed. The only software I use that may interact with games is NVIDIA Geforce Experience to make clips from games. 


Edit: I contacted the support team and this is what they responded with: ""It looks like you are writing about the restriction on your account. The account has been double checked and there is evidence of violations in the terms and services of the game. Therefore, our security solution has put your account to restriction.
 
Our team constantly checks for any false positives and if found, we handle those accordingly. Therefore, we do not provide any retests or rechecks of restrictions.
 
We apologize but there is nothing more we can do in this situation. Also, please understand that we cannot provide any exact details on what caused the infraction due to security reasons.""

I would really like to see their (((evidence))) since I know I am innocent. For what I know it may be my overclocking software (MSI Afterburner) or some winnie the pooh meme. 

BTW this is not exclusive to me this just happended to some other people. I am in contact with a person who has 7 minutes of playtime on PUBG who is dealing with the same BS like me."
1440,"(EDIT HE HAS BEEN UNBANNED)

This review will stay up for having the worst anti hacking ever, just banning random people

Permabanned my friend for no reason

He was and has never cheated in this game, just had some random files on his pc and no, I don't know what did this.

Anyway, fun game!"

Every single game developer trying to be the next PlayerUnknown, a bright future was ahead for this game. Was. Now this game is a husk of what it used to be. No care was given to the game and now it is only milking what is left. The spirit of PlayerUnknown were gone from the new maps, everything a copy of a better game. It is sad this what become of this game, Fortnite was a better shitpost."

1458,"Really good realistic hardcore BR, the gun is by far one of the best feeling, the environment is so desolate and eerie, the graphics improved a lot, I just have few issues with certain ideas of the game.

-Make gadgets go in the Pistol slot rather than a secondary weapon.
-Add some game changing events (I really want a zombie map)"

Play warzone or apex like the people who figured out what a good game is. PUBG has crashed and BURNED it is AWFUL now. Every mechanic of this game is trash. Its current state is irreparable.

1473,"This game even being free is not worth your time, I have used steam for multiple years have a decent library and have never in my entire life been banned from a game. But I claimed prime gaming loot for PUBG and thought oh maybe I should login and see if its changed at all I logged in claimed my stuff and closed the game, I never even played the tutorial the most I saw was the main menu then I uninstalled it and never played. I got up one day and was permanently banned by them I have 8 minutes of play time and didn't even make it past the menu but my steam is now marked forever. Worst customer support known to man don't even try getting help if you put in a ticket they'll just say they cant help you, ask again and explain the situation doesn't matter. They don't care about their players and anyone would be better off spending their time on a game that is at the very least willing to listen. Honestly I didn't plan on playing the game anyways I am more upset my steam is flagged because over something I didn't even do and I cant even appeal it so trust me its not worth it if I can get banned for 6 minutes of play time on the game there's no reason to waste more then that for a company who doesn't care about the player. If anyone is curious I was banned for unauthorized software namely GeForce Experience because of Nvidia Shadowplay along with the usage of a taskbar editor for windows from the Microsoft store so yeah this game is garbage.

Edit: They mass unbanned thousands of people so my ban has since been removed along with others, however if a game of this size is banning mass amounts of people without knowing why, or without reason that's a whole other issue especially if they are unwilling to help anyone who puts in support tickets."

1479,great greasy
1480,i just like the not wanting to die in this game gives your team a reason to play well
1481,"Im not at all into Battle Royale games, but imo this might be the best in this genre!"
1482,THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE TRAINING TO PLAY THE GAME EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE 70HRS OF PLAY IN THE GAME IS IDIOTIC.
1483,is good
1484,okay man
1485,full of cheaters ... level 25 will only kill you by headshots .. u wont have time to react .. moreover there is a lot of bugs and crashes every time
1486,veri gut
1487,You are a legit clown if you play this over any of the other battle royales available right now. In comparison to its competitors It's awkwardly janky and rage inducing. It's just not fun.
1488,Bullshit obligatory tutorials idgaf. thank fuck I got 7k SEK after selling the player unknown skin otherwise the state of this game is complete ass
1489,I refuse to complete a 2 hour long FORCED tutorial to play this game.  Who made this decision? Uninstalled.

1562,"I know it's probably a little late to expect it, but this game desperately needs matchmaking. You've seen it in so many other reviews, but it cannot be overstated. The preponderance of level 500 players, especially in casual matches, is absurd and it seems like there are more of them in casual matches than regular matches.

The only problem with matchmaking is, since the game is not pay to win, there is nothing stopping elite players from simply creating a new account and starting over as low level player and wiping the map masquerading as an inexperienced player. So I'm not entirely sure what the solution is, but it makes the game incredibly frustrating for those who would otherwise enjoy playing the game casually."

some games i frag out and feel really good about myself,
some games i get 0 kills and end up with my head blown off from a man sitting in a bush 300 yards away, 
then i realize that the guy i killed running into a wall was probably a bot,
then i get sad,
then i play another match and get sadder with small spikes in dopamine that crash when i realize that each kill is a slightly more realistic acting bot.
all in all the game is diluted Chinese garbage and should be regarded as such,
ching-chong-chang this game should be burning in a Chinese ditch."

Thank you for reading my review of PUBG! I really hope you enjoyed it. Check out my other reviews, I got tons of cool stuff on there."
1640,Best BR imo
1641,Ok ok ok it's not bad.
1642,Really fun game and always new and fun encounters in the game. I would reccomend it to anyone who likes semi realistic fpp shooters.
1643,GOOF
1644,Good Game
1645,goooood
1646,My experience with this game is either land and don't see anyone for 30 minutes or land and get immediately shotgun blasted. There is a casual game mode that is fun but for some reason has a limit of three matches per day. The game movement feels clunky and the graphics are poor.
1647,"in this game you will have to jump out of a plane and kill everyone in Ireland, why not socialize and escape as a team and live happy lives, no fuck that lets kill everyone because you can."
1648,shit.
1649,ten pocit keď ťa zajebe 500lvl na 400 metrov a ty len taký že gg...
1650,Cool game :)

1653,"I's in the sense of you choose your play style, all weapons are available for everyone to loot every match.
You do encounter real good players often and get killed quick, but it's a way of learning and you can start a new match immediately,"

1657,thrilled and attractive!
1658,add controller
1659,gema chrasching evry day 20 times in 3 hours playng
1660,"it is kind of fun but the cheater issue is still a BIG problem. about 50% of the games have cheaters or people lagging unable to get hit but has great accuracy themselves.
Forced to play the shitmaps only becuase they want people to play them. able to pick ""the current event map"" or have to play ""all maps"" but all maps is the same 3 maps rotating. 

the shitty matching system matching people in level 100 against people in lvl 500.

I complain still i will play because like i said alot of the games are fun they are only ruined by the cheaters and bad matching system.

1665,What a cool cideo game. PUBG is my second favourite Battle Royale game right after Fortnite. Map and weapons are as good as my KD and rank in-game (Insane). I can easily recommend this game to literally everyone. 10/10

1687,ok
1688,good
1689,"It's a good BR for those that don't feel like shooting someone 6000 times only to have them run around a corner and toss an Ult on you while healing. It's simple and that's what I like about it. You, the gun and the target. No abilities or buffs. Just your gun skill."
1690,Jogaço
1691,veryverygooooooooood
1692,i love this game so entertaining ive been playing it for 21 hours straight
1693,bad
1694,"PUBG is, in essence, the original stand-alone battle royale game. It is clunky, difficult to learn, features some of the most punishing gameplay of any BR game, mil-sim style controls, and a somewhat dwindling playerbase in NA.

And yet, it's still easily one of the best BRs on the market. Each of the 9 maps in PUBG feels distinctive, with multiple interesting POIs to play around. The guns all feel very distinct from one another, with unique recoil patterns and behavior; attachments on top of these change the dynamic of each weapon significantly. Vehicles feel weighty to drive and force you (in the case of things like the motorbikes) to drive carefully, unlike games with similar vehicles (looking at you, Fortnite).

Yeah, the game runs kinda like shit. The optimizations over the years have helped but it's certainly held back a bit by the sheer scale of the maps which range from around the size of another BR game like Fortnite or Apex to the size of an Ubisoft/Rockstar open world game. And yeah, the controls are very clunky, deriving primarily from Arma II where this game's predecessor mod existed. But that only ads to the charm of the game, where players move slowly and deliberately and positioning and pre-planning take precedence to the moment to moment action of other top BR titles.

The only true negative for PUBG is its use of BattlEye anti-cheat, an utterly ineffective and easy to bypass system that has allowed more cheaters through than other games with stronger, custom anti-cheat measures like Warzone's Ricochet. Overall, though, the occasional cheater is worth getting to experience the fun this game still has years after its initial launch. Now that it's free to play, there's no excuse for not giving it a shot."
1695,Conner Dinn sent me here
1696,Like pew pew and stuff
1697,Seems like there are less cheaters these days.
1698,"Yes

1756,"after 2.2k hours on the game they've convinced me that PUBG has the most uncapable developers/maintenance engineers . It's been like almost a week now that servers are strugling with a PING issue and they dont seem to manage to fix it and in my opinion that's unacceptable for a company that have made it so far. Before anyone tell me that it maybe has to do with my internet provider , it doesn't , i run speedtests while during those random 2minutes 230MS and my ping on the test seems perfect and besides that i've seen some streamers and other random players that complaining about this issues.

For real,I give credits to PUBG for being the pioneer (after Minecraft Hunger Games) of a sub-genre that became a f* trend for years and years but I think that in 2022, in this status,the game is done.
There is no need to play this game,if you really wanna play PUBG you can get the PUBG Mobile emulated version using the emulator released by Tencent themself and have a better\similar experience but with more performances,more variety,more updates and a bigger community or you can try the other superior Battle Royale experiences that can be much more fun and quick to play.

(or just play other and better games like Elden Ring,Devil May Cry 5,Resident Evil 2,Titanfall 2...just saying)"
1820,"IDK after going from Apex to this game it was like going from Driving a Ferrari to walking in sand. This is very slow and tactical, which I do enjoy (I love EFT) but like most BR's they really aren't appealing to me anymore. IDC if I kill 20 people and win when all I get is a new battlepass level and a gun skin. At least with Apex you can master chars with different abilities and use in game currency to unlock other chars.  

KRAFTON needs to make a new game, with a new engine. This looks dated AF but seeing as its still top 10 in steam and makes them loads of money, I doubt we will see PUBG 2 anytime soon. 

"
1821,"Good battle royale game to play with your friends. It requires good skills and tactics. Also, it has an excellent gun play."
1822,this game is good because it always be good then warzone but warzone is but he is dying but pubg will never die because this game not for gay. gay poeple will play fortnite pubg plays only strait man
1823,I like this game
1824,Too much cheaters

1859,For me personaly is this game best BR out there  i have almost over 1000 h alredy so i think i can say that is the best but for beginners hard to learn from beginning after while you will be not able to stop playin trust me
1860,Fun to play casually but other games of this genre I feel are more fun and balanced. I do really like that atmosphere of the maps as they feel more realistic than other games of this genre. Very post apocalyptic feel.

1868,"This game is broken, fully hacker not suggest to play."
1869,"First the bad:
The game crashes a lot. I mean like it takes 3 tries to even get it going. It used to crash mid-game which is really frustrating, but they seem to have ironed that out. I wonder what programming language they are using. Or why it's happening.

Also, they've gameified the interface so much its hard to know where to click to get what. Very chinese/asian vibes in that regard. There are 3 different crafting areas, two different coins, two different places to buy guns, two ways to get skins, multiple events you have to opt into to get free drops, plus the premium system which you gotta manually click to get rewards plus free drops within that system if you are not premium. A lot of clicking around to understand what is going on. Eventually it mostly makes sense, but it seems unnecessarily convoluted.

However, with that said, the gameplay loop is great. It is challenging, but you do get better. It is realistic enough to feel like a solid accomplishment when you do win. It requires talent, and coordination, and raw skill, and a decent PC. It's fun because it is challenging enough to make you want more. The people playing right now are mostly decent. Occasionally there is an asshole, but generally I have a good time playing with complete strangers. People have mics and everyone tends to try their best.

It's a good 30m to 1h time commitment and then move on.."
1870,nice +rep
1871,is good game men

1880,Dead game filled with bots.
1881,"Can't play the game because of the constant mouse glitch/lag issue even after turning off all the overlays, apart from that the game is pretty fun."
1882,"I am a work at home mother, Onlyfans for life. Only profession I ever had. I tried playing time this game for 10 minutes, and it tries to ""educate me"" on how to play a game that everyone already knows how to play. I mean how stupid do you think we actually are, Krafton Inc?"
1883,Yes
1884,It is fun
1885,This game has an extremely high skill curve and is very hard play when your're a beginner. The game isn't fun when you can't even see the guy who killed you. Either you land with other players and die immediately before you can even get a gun or you land somewhere quiet and then go 30 mins without seeing anyone and die in the first gunfight you encounter.

"
1923,trash
1924,"I don't find this game as fun playing alone but with friends, it turns the game around big time! The movement in this game is pretty slow as in animations of crouching to prone to crouching. You're basically going to take a lot of damage or die while being stuck inside of the animation and wish it was a bit quicker. I do like how the game actually added more of a purpose to playing this game with the ranking system and challenges."
1925,good
1926,"its fun
"
1927,pretty fun i guess
1928,cool
1929,"How long has this been out? and they still only have like two game modes? There has been a lot of changes over time but all I noticed when I got back on after 2 years of not playing was a new map and a bunch of more things to buy in micro transactions. Why is this not progressed into more stuff? Why is there only battle royal and team deathmatch? why am I still playing this? Pleasse help my. Okay pros of this game it is a bit addicting if you like BR and makes adrenaline rush, aggrivating when you die after no kills with an hour into a game."

1954,"i hate this game so much, i wish the creators of this game would just cut all the servers down, this game makes me want to hang myself off the ceiling with my monitor cable and reincarnate as a python, slither down KRAFTON Inc's router wires and stick my fangs deep in the monster who made this and inject venom that would slowly kill him and give a painful ending.

2032,"Between the console and PC versions of this game, I have played 400+ hours of PUBG, starting in 2017. Back then, the console version was not in a good state. DCs in 25% of the games, frame drops, etc. I recently returned to the title on PC, and I can say that performance has vastly improved. I've played over 150 hours in the PC version and have yet to disconnect from a single game. I don't notice any significant framerate lag or other performance issues in game. The new map Deston is, IMHO, their best yet, although Erangel will always be my favorite. They have added new mechanics, new weapons, new gear, and the experience is the best it has ever been. Now is the time for old players to return, and, since the game is free to play, now is the time for new players to dip their toes in. If you are a new player, find some experienced vets to show you the ropes. I have installed and uninstalled this game over the years, but there's something about this game that keeps calling me back."
2033,jn
2034,"Very awesome game. The training physic changes are a pain when it comes to the first person aiming, you might want to do some research before you start but once against in a lobby with 100 other players and once in the field is a blast!"

I mean the game is free so rip 0$.

What spiffs me is I was streaming when I was banned, and it shows my inputs. I'll just send the clip, ten seconds to prove my inocence. 

Nope bans are non disputable, they will always go ""lamo no""

But the 2 games I was able to I play with randoms I had teammates scream more racial slurs than og cod lobbies."
2043,better than bubba g mobile
2044,"I read in other reviews about cheaters. As you can understand from the time I played, I have not run into them. So I liked the game. But not enough to devote dozens of hours of my life to it. I also did not like the intrusive menus with purchased in-game items and the mandatory long training."

2074,very fun... NOW FREE AS WELL SINCE THAT'S WHEN I GOT IT :D
2075,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

2095,"i used to love  this game for grinding the battle points for the gacha crates . Since they removed all the BP crates from the store/shop it feels like im grinding the BP for nothing.Well there are a few cosmetics that i can buy with BP but it's not really worth it to buy it all with all the BP that i grind.

"
2096,"Pretty fun, & a classic Battle Royal game! Has a lot going for it as far as realism, game mechanics, weapon & gear types, vehicles, and customization. 

I've experienced a few random crashes during game, or after a battle ends which is odd. I did some tweaks to the game, & some PC settings that I found out about from a guide off youtube, it should do the trick to fix the crashing. So whilst it can happen, it's easy enough to manually fix it. I admit that the admins should have patched this by now, being how old this game is. Is what it is... That won't prevent me from having fun in this game, nor should it prevent you either. That is, unless you are uptight, & or easily triggered? If that's the case well, get rekt! LOL.. This isn't a game for you pleb.

Do I recommend PubG? Of course I do, duh!
It's free, so try it out for yourself. Nothing to lose, 
other than pride when you get dropped in battle. hehe :)

2142,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

2177,ass
2178,"I support and cherish all people who played the OG PUBG during the summer of 2018. For it was the best time anybody could've experienced this game, and this is not just some old-school novelty nostalgia. At its current state, the game has been overrun by mountains of over-saturated content in update race wars with Fortnite, Apex, Warzone, and many more. It's not the developer's fault for adding in things, but rather a distasteful fact. The fact that this game does not respect your time, and you shouldn't either. For every new shiny toy, a skin, a season, and a questionable gameplay decision added in, it is another moment to reflect and reconsider playing this game by yourself or with friends. Games are art, meant to evoke interest, curiosity, and most important of all, fun. This is not a game, this is a sellout money-making machine."
2179,GOOD
2180,this game is on fire
2181,You already know.
2182,"i play before
"
2183,"bought this shit a long time ago i played it like a few times and then stopped and now its free
bruh
"
2184,good
2185,"ive played tons on Xbox n mobile 
but at this point in time the only people playing are either the try hard sweats or hackers
for some reason you cant do matches with just bots to get yourself used to stuff well you can but just 10 games thats it. 
i bought the game a paid version why cant i make a match with bots"
2186,a simple shooter would rather not play cod
2187,My friends say I am a Bluehole rep on the side for how often I ask them to play pubg
2188,Great game but it is full of cheaters and hackers. Get what you pay for though.
2189,Imagine paying money

2192,"I played 143 games, not one kill, the minimum level of players with me was 455. The developers just scoff, the game is teeming with cheaters and crazy people as much as possible. If you want to spend 100 hours watching how other players play after you die, then welcome."
2193,poor quality game with very poor maintenance. i now know why its is free to play now. i have not been able to play in 2 days cause the game kicks me to the desktop and closes the game right before it loads the main menu. i am tired of always have issues with this game. i paid for season pass and probably wont be able to finish the pass cause of the issue of not being able to play the game. if your looking for a good game keep looking this game is MEDIOCRE at best
2194,nice
2195,sus
2196,hmmm
2197,This game is more dead than your mum joke
2198,fun
2199,Haven't seen a single pub since I started playing. 1/10
2200,"Downloaded this after seeing news piece that the developers had made it free to play...YAY

Downloaded and played........sorry started it up waited 5 minutes black screen kicked me out with crash window.

No wonder they gave this game free it cant even start up

0/10 dont bother downloading me thinks the developers ditched this game for a newer game"
2201,its very good game.
2202,"The reason why I bought an extra 8 GB of RAM when it first came out. Was it worth it? For this game, no. For other games, yes! Pretty good if you like realistic-ish gunplay, but the server instability and constant hackers make it a slog. Not recommended."

2204,hard
2205,"45 hours in, and EVERY SINGLE interaction is heart pumping. Awesome game"
2206,PvE
2207,This game was more fun when it first launched and ran on 20 FPS.
2208,game has going full black and i cant see anything. have to force restart pc. after new big update the game has been lagging like hell. i cant go to waiting lobby cuz game is loading in loading screen. cant jump from plane cuz its in loading screen. i can hear everything but its in loading screen forever. after 10+ mins or so i can finally play but the game makes huge lag spikes. its also lagging in lobby and settings etc
2209,"Funny game to play with ur friends. But thing is ... if u are good and people report you for ""hacking"" they ban u 24hours to review the case. A totally waste of time when u are playing legit."
2210,best battle royale
2211,Def a fun game to play with the hommies!!!
2212,"ok, so first, its not a bad game. but there is an element that ruins it all the way for me and most likely others. some players have real  raw skill and talent when it comes to gunplay, but the play zone is ridiculous compared to the map size. the game is not user friendly, is a pain with graphics, the only game that lags on my pc, and i play games double these specifications, and it just isnt impressing me anymore. the play zone needs to be fixed."
2213,yes fortnite is better
2214,Fun game to fuck around with friends in. Even fun to play alone. OG battle royale and still relevant for a reason.
2215,"nothing about it i just cant stop playing

"
2216,nice
2217,best fps
2218,Fun and all but players are annoying. Instead of focusing on gameplay they on some conversation nonsense crap that disrupts gameplay. Too much noise by speaking constantly instead of calling out positions and helpful  notions. Can't really hear a thing..... Beware to lower voice level or turn it off and/or mute but it sucks because you don't get full experience.

2220,Patience is a virtue... especially in this game. But its worthwhile nevertheless. A welcome slower alternative to those action shooters like COD or Apex or even Valorant/CS.

2222,"Good, but there are many tryhards and cheaters so beware. :D"
2223,"I'm not bothered with the slow paced gameplay at all but after 5+ years and there are still tons of same bugs and glitches alongside with very clunky movement, even the mobile version has much better movement feeling. The only good thing about this game is that it inspired other developers to make a better game with the same genre"

The game is very very fun but please do something about the matchmaking

Also you don't know where you're getting shot from"

2255,"Honestly, this game is addicting, but I can't really say it's FUN.  I've played for 387 hours over the last couple of years, and I'm still terrible at it.  The games are dominated by really high-level players, and there is no skill-based matchmaking, so a typical game is spending 10 minutes running around gathering loot, then 5 minutse running from the circle, and then dying from someone you never saw.  Rinse and repeat.

It's fun to jump in a game with friends and mess around, but I can't say I'd recommend this game to a new player, unless you're already well-versed in battle-royale type games and good at them."
2256,Look at the hours on my record. Game is fun
2257,Loads and loads of gameplay. IF you like king of the hill looters this is for you.
2258,Bot Royale
2259,"I have wasted something close to 1400 hours in this game desperately trying to ""get good"". But after all that time, watching every streamer or youtuber who could offer any instruction, playing with the best players I could hook up with in order to learn from them, practicing in TDM and the training mode, and doing just about everything I could to improve my game, paying for better hardware and better internet, hours researching and tinkering with my settings, on and on, I have finally come to the conclusion that it isn't me, it's the game. 

I outsmart other players, surprise them, outgun them, shoot first and hit my headshots, and they don't go down. I put sniper round after sniper round right square in their faces and they don't go down. Hit shot after shot at close range with shotguns and they don't go down.

The final straw came today when I hot dropped, got a beryl, and fired half the magazine into the chest of a totally unarmored foe, blood spray just about blockign my view, and he didn't go down. He walked right up to me while I put bullets in his chest and punched me out.

This game is broken. No other game performs this poorly for me, not even the little crowdfunded goofy shooter games. Massive desync and non-reg all day, every day. This game sucks and the developers are far more concerned with dropping new maps and game-breaking items (blue chip detector anyone?) than they are with fixing game performance. Too much of my life has gone into this piece of shit and it is way past time for me to uninstall it and move on to something else."

2330,"PUBG is completely RNG-based with the weapons and items, has a messy user interface, has severe problems with the servers, has HUGE game-breaking bugs and playing it is just overall not a good time.
This game does have one saving grace, however, and that is being able to go to my game library, clicking on the game, clicking on gear icon, hovering over 'MANAGE', and clicking that sweet, sweet 'UNINSTALL' button!
To be really thorough, I'd recommend also clicking 'REMOVE FROM ACCOUNT'."

2336,Baba G
2337,"
PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a poorly designed and executed battle royale game that is plagued by technical issues and is far too reliant on luck to be enjoyable.

The game's map is bland and uninspired, the gunplay is floaty and inaccurate, and the game is plagued by technical issues such as server lag, rubber banding, and crashes.

The game's biggest problem is its complete reliance on luck. The game's loot system is RNG-based, meaning that players have no control over what weapons and items they will find. This often leads to players being completely outmatched and unable to win fights, regardless of their skill level.

The game is also poorly designed and is need of a major rework. The UI is cluttered and confusing, the game's menus are confusing and difficult to navigate, and the game lacks any sort of tutorial or onboarding to help new players understand how to play.

Overall, PUBG is a poorly designed, buggy, and luck-based battle royale game that is not worth your time."

2343,"I've been playing this game since shortly after release, back when it ran like crap and only had 1 map. 
But I keep coming back, and the quality of the game has improved ridiculously. It runs smoothly, the map pool is diverse and fun, and it makes me HAPPY :D"
2344,"Absolute garbage game. Terrible gun mechanics. Weird/buggy hit boxes. Terrible damage multipliers, don't bother hitting head shots they do nothing. Trash can emotes. Boring clothing. They literally only care about PUBG mobile, not the PC version. Where is the Resident Evil crossover game with zombies and Resident Evil bosses for the PC like they had on mobile? That's about the only time I would ever come back and play this dog shit game."
2345,"I've owned this game since around season 3, before the game became free to play.  I'm not particularly fond of the point-and-click arcade shooters.  In contrast, I'm a big fan of velocity and bullet drop being factors in PUBG- this game seems to encourage/reward a much more complex skillset, vs. your more recent Warzone or Apex style shooters, which PUBG also gave way to =).

2351,I enjoyed it.
2352,"Hi,

the game is okay / good. The perfomance got much better in the last 2 years. I played since the beginning. So I know what I'm talking about. Now I see a game with a a really cool system and ""realism"" but I has one big problem and some smaller ones. The big Problem is the Bot / Rank System. You will be in a Game who is Lvl 500 and he /she will kill you instently. I dont know what the purpose of this is but, it  can be that hard to create a sort of rank system. But no PUBG does not want that the want to speed there money and time for skins and other usless shit. Also the Botsystem kinda sucks, but I can understand the idea behind that, but the realization is just not that good. 

I will play this game when It has a better rank System so you can play with people that are in your league and you wont get no scoped from 600m away from lvl 500."

Players who have much worse specifications can't even play that game, which is actually good for them, as playing this can now be considered a torture as well.

2488,"Still full of hackers. Maybe less than when the game first came out, but making it free to play has definitely promoted hackers to return or to take up playing. I've returned to the game after 4 years or so without playing and I will say, it runs nearly flawlessly but occasionally it will crash. Unfortunately nearly every game I either die to or encounter a hacker and it really takes the fun out of it and makes it not worth my while. They should make it pay to play again and really try to focus on anti-cheat."

2525,"Interesting, I'm glad to know that its not being abandoned as it is in favor of a new game. More polishing and more features sure could make this game better.

If I may add some more suggestions as to what I personally believe would be nice to add:

1) Option to chat with other characters (at least the main ones) which could affect how they feel about me.

2) The chance to experience multiple endings based on actions taken during the game.

3) An option to kiss or cuddle during sex. I mean...its nice if there is an option to be a bit romantic too. In fact why not add even a modicum of romance to the player if one is interested in pursuing it?

4) The chance to play ""voyeur"" to other characters having sex and see them talking during sex. Maybe even join them.

5) The game seems to have a main girl that is behind the events of the game. It would be cool if she got some kind of relationship values that could affect how things would end up with her. Like becoming her sex slave, a casual fling, one of her consorts, make HER into your sex slave, becoming an evil couple in crime, a harem ending for the player or actually getting some loving and romantic relationship (while riding into the sunset).

6) Maybe the chance to get to be a pseudo detective by learning stuff about characters and the events that take place both through conversations and collecting clues? That may help solve some mysteries or manipulate/reveal characters hidden fetishes or agendas?

7) Some/more places with more life around them? Like more characters who live their own life and have some specific schedules (maybe changeable based on the player character's actions)?

8) The chance to avoid fights via dialogue/sex/knowledge about the character with whom one normally would fight?

9) Threesome sex scenes (if they are not there already).

10) Collecting letters/notes that explain better what is going on in the story or about characters in further detail.

11) Chance to interact with characters even outside of sex scenes. Like groping/hugging/kissing someone and have said character react in a specific way depending on their personality or the relationship they have with the player or someone else (like if they are married or in love with someone but the player might with a good deal of effort seduce even such people if doing the right things).

Cheers!"

2530,"Initially: would not recommend, here's why:

""New PUBG: looks great, sounds great, runs great.

What's the problem?

Lvl 500 player TEAMS matched against lvl 2 randoms.

PUBG: do the right thing, and solve the matchmaking.  Don't just throw any old groups together.  This is why so many games are dying, and why you are not reaching your potential.  If people could play with like minded, similarly skilled players, then there will be more fun.  But getting wiped out by people who have specialised recently in the Beryl for 900 hours since patch vs my 600 hours total since OG days and probably since before half the lvl500s were even born?  Please.  Don't let this game die after so much effort.""

2647,"Don't buy, don't play. 
This used to be some kind of funny game. Now you are just a target for high level players who kill you from more then 100 meter. To be honest, it has become a boring game. 
Unless you want to spend more then 60 hours a week in this game you will get killed every time you play this.
It has become an unbalanced game where high level very experienced players can use newbies for target practicing. But it the bad news doesn't stop there. The shrinking end zones are not really random. So people know after the first circle where the game will end. Boring! The vehicles are always on the same spots. Boring! The weapons are often on the same spots. Boring! Don't waste time or money this crap game. There are way better ones out there. And I didn't even mention all the cheaters who use aimbots and kill you with a headshot from 500m distance while you're running. 
Tetris is more exciting."

2763,"PUBG is my favourite BattleRoyal, it's so realistic and lots of fun. I'm playing since March 2019. 
We've stopped playing it for sometime due to new update of Sanhok map which we didn't like so much and it's bootcamp sucks. Now we've started again as old Sanhok map is reloaded again , So I want to thanks the PUBG team for bringing old Sanhok map to us, it's such an nostalgia and pleasure to play.

2790,"What is there left to say about this transformative game that hasn't already been said?  

My favorite aspect of PUBG:BG, and the thing that sets it apart from most other BR games is its pacing.  This is a much slower BR game when compared to Warzone or Apex.  Firefights can last minutes, and involve multiple targets in multiple locations.  

The driving in this game is surprisingly satisfying, and could easily be considered top tier among non driving focused games.

On NA servers this game still holds up today, and with Cheaters becoming a more rare occurrence, one could even argue PUBG is in the best shape of its lifespan."
2791,"Game is so good 
"
2792,"PUBG as you know it, is a great FPS shooter Battle Royale with realistic gunplay. Do to this, it has steep learning curve but extremely fun to play once you've mastered. A lot of gamers say that the game has lost value after many popular streamers left playing it, which is far from the truth. The thing is PUBG has kept on improving on all its gameplay aspects. One can confidentally say that PUBG is in a better form as it was back in the day. Of course there are bugs and glitches, but which game is free of it. As for new player, it's a great game to play with your friends to unwind the day."

2846,well as i played this beauty of a game i would like to say my hours match up perfect with how good this game is. think about it
2847,"This game started out as a gem. Sure it had goofiness and glitches, but they were manageable. It was extremely fresh and fun with friends. It was a blast. It was a combination of early DayZ and Arma III mechanics. It's now nothing but a cesspool of hackers and toxicity (they had to remove lobby chat awhile ago). Your random teammates will be useless from the beginning. You'll get one-shotted by someone who automatically snaps onto you in the killcam from a random building or location several hundred meters away. Don't even get me started on the bots. It has been overloaded with absolute cringe skins that are astronomically priced in the store. Thumbnails of items never reflect what's actually in the store most of the time. Also, what's with the random Assassin's Creed and Nier Automata skins? The random battle points (original) packs are worthless and the chance of getting anything remotely cool looking is near zero. This game did not need to jump on the season/battlepass/microtransaction bandwagon that it so graciously has. It'll eventually die off as it should've a long time ago."
2848,nice
2849,Put it simple It is the best br experience there is. I always end up coming back especially since they started giving us new content again. It is the hardest br to get good at but by far the most rewarding.

2851,"Good controls. Maps are distinctive. Hackers/cheaters are few and far between, and really easy to get rid of. match making is quick. only complaint is that even on the strongest consoles and computers, parts of the game get laggy."

But there is a few points that make me uncomfortable :
>Battlepass, skins. We paid for this game, and we still have to buy stuff ? Don't count me in
>Bots. You play against bots for a few hours before being against real people, in ranked matchmakings.
>Toxic and DUMB community. Bro why do you go to the military base just to die in the first couple of minutes ? or at pochinki, school ? get yourself together and do better. THINK.
Allies will not come to save you, they just don't care because they are in a 1 vs 100 mentality.

2907,good game
2908,"Bro get rid of the tutorials? I've played 33hrs and still have to load in to do the tutorial still? thats a joke
"
2909,nice game!
2910,"It's the standard Battle Royal, you drop in and loot some weapons to fight.
Sometimes you do well sometimes you do bad.

The only bad thing I would say is that the ingame shop is confusing and overly convoluted with what feels like 10 different menus 5 currencies and a micro-transaction shop.

If you play for the game it's super, if you want to dive into cosmetics.... Good Luck"
2911,"fun and enjoyable, but frequently interupted by MUCH higher level players RKOing new players... I heavily reccomend getting REALLY good at games like DayZ, Arma 3, Hell Let Loose, Squad or Tarkov before you start down a PUBG path"
2912,Fun!
2913,good game
2914,"run in field, die to m24/kar98k"

2916,game fucking blows
2917,"I Like this game alot but it is packed full of cheaters. every game just about, and you can tell which ones too like the ones that dont even bother to use names just numbers or a bunch of random letters or  ,or the ones from China. In fact PUBG would get rid of almost all the cheating if thy did not alow china on the platform or at the very least just have NA servers with out Chinese so we can play an actual game without the cheating I am sick of it and it is always china ALWAYS"
2918,Very much yes
2919,better then fortnight but still absolute garbage.
2920,Not bad.
2921,good game
2922,Why limit AI training mode to 10 matches? I don't understand the logic but I can sense it's not something nice towards the players.
2923,Good game
2924,So I can't even transfer my progression from console even though I'm using the same Krafton account and it's crossplay with those consoles?
2925,only mentally retarded devs would put a mandatory tutorial for returning players
2926,  play fucking game
2927,why is tutorial so kapoy
2928,runs much better now
2929,"I played PubG when it first launched. Put it down for the past 1.5 yrs. Had some friends recently pick it back up, so today, august 8th 2022 I decided to boot it up again. Although I have almost 1000 hrs between xbox and pc, the game required me to play the training. Nothing aside from a few new guns/equipment have been added, yet I was forced to spend an hour of my day killing bots, and doing things that I already knew how to do, such as throw a grenade, or drink a redbull. After wasting my time I finally unlock the ability to play the game only to find out that they removed duos, and my buddy and I cannot play... Used to be a great game. Now its trash. Not sure who is calling the shots now, but they obviously do not know or appreciate the original fan base. Dont waste your time"
2930,"Garbage game. It's a waste of time, you spawn, gather loot for 15mins and then get gunned down by some camper. The competitive element of the game takes out all the fun in it. Everyone is fighting tooth and nail to get the victory screen, but they forget to have fun. Expect to get angry and have a bad time when you play this."
2931,gud
2932,Good game
2933,"when your game can't be played beyond the tutorial, you done fucked up."

2946,"Pros: It works.
Cons: It only works sometimes.
Finito."
2947,Very funny to play with friends
2948,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
2949,Needs better cheat detection. Other than that it's gud
2950,.
2951,Ok every once in a while.
2952,"Can't really recommend at this point. People found out the which are the best weapons and mechanics they can abuse, and it just makes the game meh. That's all you need to look for . Kar98, and stay at the border of the ring . Nothing else to it, besides practice of course with that weapon, but all the rest are just there to fill in some emptiness.  I gave it a shot but seems Battle Royale games are not for me. Too much running around and just searching for loot. It started out as a cool game, but now it's all just cool looking clothing and other cosmetic items, like weapon skins, which is something I hate. Cool when it's about cars, looks childish when it comes to guns."
2953,Veri Gud
2954,Veri guud game
2955,"This game is honestly a very good game it just lacks in graphics, gameplay, physics, enjoyability, map design, overall game design, first person gameplay, third person gameplay, player movement, balancing items and server stability. 
So it's safe to say this game in not recomended by me :)."
2956,"I recommend this however,

There are many things that I dont like, I made a list:
1. Unable to chose map.
2. The in game store for skins... Is super confusing and I just dont understand it, it changed so much in the last period of time.
3. Since this game doesnt look like it will release another they should overhaul the graphics and make them nice and modern.
4. Add more options to communicate (via chat).
5. More settings. for scopes...
6. The stuff from PUBG mobile.

and more...
"
2957,"not bad, worth the money to play with friends"
2958,"Game is good, look at this instead.

3025,"The tutorial is too long, Got so bored I did not want to play the game anymore. Why should I have to do 15 missions before I can play?"
3026,The game is just fine from gameplay perspective. but that's where my compliment's end because this game is Horrable to look at. And i'd much rather play TABG witch is a landfalls spin on this game and it much better than this. but is you don't care about that it's a good time.

The one thing I do not like is that the game is very stiff. Another thing, I am not a fan on having to keep ADS and Canted separate binds. Overall I do enjoy playing this game even though I haven't played it long. It's a good change from COD and other multiplayer games."
3029,Can't believe I've wasted time and money on this crap.
3030,"The combats feels real, better than some games >"
3031,better than pubg mobile XD
3032,"PUBG offers a varied range of combat from vehicles to close combat, the new tactical weapons make it even more fun while retaining balance (Drones, Spotter Scope, EMT Gear).

I also like there's a Casual mode for when you don't want to play a too sweaty game. There are consistent updates which make the game great, with some free stuff. The battle passes are pretty good value for money similar to other games, and never required."

3131,"I'd rather be playing Apex
I think I can still recommend this to squads and masochists
This game added way too many tools that I don't even want to think about using. EMT gear? Mortars, Spike Traps, Drones? Just gimme an AK47 and a silenced doohickey. I'm not planning on settling down here, you know? It's hard enough not dying to the zone. At least as a solo player these additions feel like a waste of time and ground loot, but I suppose these additions may fill a gap for the people in your squad who can't shoot. Maybe I should reconsider these additions after all...
And speaking of getting in the way (well NOT in the way), you can actually loot guns and ammo with pretty good efficiency now, even in spite of the all the additional items *clap clap*.
The game runs a lot smoother than it once did. Thank goodness, because now I can truly experience the full onslaught of veteran cracked demigod semi-pro PUBG laser-eyed massacreists who blow out my eye-sockets back to school before my eye-BALLS even processed what stood before them *clap clap*"

3157,"Honestly i loved this game early on like everyone else. played it habitually solo and with friends. in TPP and FPP. when the cheating got really bad i took breaks and would get the itch to play again and reinstall. Had a couple decent games now that the popularity has died down some. Just assumed anyone i die to is just better than me. no problem i know im not great at least not anymore. Just for kicks i got NAILED by a M24 from across the Mbase and my first thought was ""damn that guy landed a really nice shot!"" then wanted to see how he finished with about 13 people left. when i went into his view i realized he was snapping around looking at everyone and locking onto their heads even when they were behind cover. and without reloading he killed the entire rest of the lobby with very obvious aim botting active. It's just not fun anymore. I have a ton of friends all kinda with the itch and im the one who usually convinces them to re download this game. Its over. dont bother. Reinstalling this game over and over wanting it to be better felt like leaving a flower on its grave for so long but now im letting it go. Bye PUBG. you were good for like 6 months."

Sounds doable I've played it on console years ago, but what in the HOLY HECK, why does it act like a mobile game??

3211,"This game is not for the faint-hearted. I've been playing PubG since it was in alpha stages so over 5 years now just about. That being said it has it's flaws but the devs have put some efforts into making it a better experience albeit they've taken mechanics from other games and implemented it into their own without infringing upon copyrights and I respect that. 
This is one of the very few 3rd person perspective battle royales out there that helped create the genre and then they had issues being able to get set up for competitive play so they just locked the FPP view and said ""hey we have fpp, let us make more money by having pro gaming on it.""
     End of the day on this its a third person game, if you can't play it in that view by all means go fpp but you're just limiting yourself. The community is still fairly large but toxic at times as FPP players always hate on TPP players cus they lack the knowledge and aptitude of realizing this game was actually made for TPP originally and try to act like they're better than you.
     The biggest flaw this game has is that it doesn't have its own anti-cheat and there are hackers, an abundance of them at that. Just spectate and report them. If you have a good squad and people that can work together you can still potentially kill the hackers but only if you third party and pick them off since they can either see you with esp or just insta-lock onto you with an aimbot. 
     Ultimately they still suck cus they have to use such exploits to simulate they're good at the game or just to piss other people off. If you have a good group of friends that communicate well and can use proper strategies this game is fun even if it still pisses you off at the same time it still always balances it out."

That was until i was met with constant frame drops and stuttering on medium settings with an RX6600xt and being kicked out of the game before I even hit the ground. I am so disappointed in this experience and can only hope that this issue is resolved soon.

3261,"Since nobody on the PUBG community will read the reviews, I'll say in this review I'm gay and I love cross-dressing as a femboy."
3262,"Though I am super late in trying it out. I have enjoyed my experience in the game. 

I like the ability to go prone, crouch, standing. not all games allow that. 
I really like the way this game can seem to blend the benefits of using both first and third person. Though I do not mind playing first person locked games at all. I really do enjoy the mix of first and third person found in casual mode. Mind you I have no idea of the negatives long term players would probably know of. I really enjoyed the gun selection, though at first I did not understand the modding weapons with addons part very well at first. Within five or so games I understood things pretty well and was comfortable with navigating the inventory. Now I find it quite polished and fluid. Sometimes I find picking up one item that is stacked upon another weapon that you dont want just to have it grab the weapon and throw down your current. thats a bit annoying.. I think the sound is quite excellent. I like the way the bullet snaps over your head, or off the rocks nearby.. The sound is very VERY good. I think my favorite thing in my gameplay so far is how well this game allows the player to use terrain to avoid incoming gunfire. When I played this game I was reminded of a story an ex soldier told me about being able to hid behind a simple roadside curb to avoid incoming fire. Thats how it feels, Like the smarter player can quickly dive into a divit in the ground, follow a ditch or just trying to keep in cover. I enjoy (for now at least) surviving in this game. The simple act of surviving into the top ten still feels very rewarding to me. As does getting a single kill in a match. As a solo player I treat it very much like I am trying to survive in a very hostile place. Sometimes I actively avoid conflict, kite around to the other side of the circle. sit in the blue waiting for people to leave. Maybe none of this is what an experienced player does. But for now it feels great to me. I am not fond of the smaller maps. I find this game is best suited to my tastes with that first really bit map. Though again, long time players would probably disagree. People have told me vaulting and movement is terrible.. I actually would disagree. I find the movement to be fine. and the vaulting is janky if you aproach at shit angles (kinda on you) but reliable headon. Overall I find the game to be very entertaining for now. I got it for free so any mileage is good right? I would not know much about hackers or how bad the issue is in this game. I do see alot of lvl 500 players aims doing some pretty impressive snappy movements onto some very precisely aimed heads. or some insane deathcame autotracking where it seems like the player can see me and is just waiting for me to pop out. or maybe I was just making too much noise cause im new? Who knows. I do know that for now, that is not my concern. Nothing is riding on my winning these games. I dont actually care if I do or not and most times I am just happy to hit the top ten. I am twenty five ours in and still doing a match or two a day so I think this game is doing fine by me. Because I cannot spell reccomend, I suggest that you try this game, or maybe even re visit it as some of the old complaints seem to have been fixed."

From Australia I need to use a VPN to connect to Asia & play on 120 ping whenever I feel like playing a competitive game which isn't filled with 80+ AI bots. Developers also need to put more effort into game optimization.. What ever happened to Unreal Engine 5? Worth trying with friends if you haven't now that it's F2P
3298,I have never seen a game this bad ! updates are not optimized! match making system is not good ! and does not even have good graphics ! thumbs down

3313,This has been shit since release and only stayed shit bombing zones still in the game for no reason love RNG zones that just airstrike you after you've ran across the map for 10 mins seeing nobody and if you don't die to the bombing zone someone snipes you before you even see them anyway. For some reason the devs finally added a gulag to be able to come back after getting thirsted in the game when playing with friends but for some reason ONLY PUT IT ON ONE MAP and also don't forget there's no way to pick the map you play on because the games so dead and shit they have to make everyone play on one playlist so good luck playing on maps you actually like! So sad that this game came out and everyone wanted to play it over H1Z1 thinking it would at least get better unlike what H1 did and this game has stayed shit just like H1. The game is also full of cheaters now that it's gone free to play and the worst part of that is that they don't perma ban blatant hackers right away! I reported someone who was obv aim botting and the next day got a message saying he was banned for TWO DAYS I screenshotted it and put it on my profile today I got on to another message about the same player FINALLY GETTING A PERMA BAN because he came back after the two day and was hacking right away again why are these players not immediately perma banned? It's totally not like the games free and he can just go make another account right away right? C'mon devs lets have a higher iq then below freezing temps please and thanks then maybe the game will be playable.

3350,"Game has gotten a lot better over the years, including all the extra functions like death cam and watching your in-game replay on any player for that match so you can report hackers/cheaters a lot easier. One of the main reason I quit the game for a couple of years is cause of all the hackers but with most of them gone now days I find myself playing this game almost everyday lately. Game is keeping it fresh by adding more maps although I am disappointed that they temporarily removed Vikendi map (snow map) when thats 1 of the better maps in my opinion but hate Miramar map (desert map)."

Only two things that sucks is when you ping a location the ping barely visible and Here in South Africa we play on 200+ping which you can kinda get used to. Super fun when you pass the learning curve.

3466,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

3482,"So, to begin with this, I installed PUBG again to play with a buddy of mine. I played for less than an hour and got off. I had to work that morning. I work the entire weekend and get back on today and noticed that PUBG banned me and also put a VAC on my steam account. I contacted support and they explained that there may be a software (how am I suppose to know which software) on my computer even though that it does not have to do with hacking and or cheating that goes against guidelines. I'm a full time police officer and I play games on my days off to relieve stress along with time away. I simply explained to them that they need to create some sort of document writing down every single program there is that goes against their guidelines so people in the future along with myself will know. I have never in my years of living cheat/hacked, nor downloaded any sort of programs that would change or effect the gameplay. Below is what the original response from PUBG support - 
It looks like you are writing about a restricted account.

We understand that this may be a very frustrating experience. However, please understand that a restriction is placed because we have determined that there was a violation of our terms and services and is permanently restricted. Your account has been banned on 2022-07-31 23:41:10 KST and the process cannot be reversed.
 
Please note that even without having any programs specifically for “hacking/cheating” there are other programs or actions that can violate our Rules of Conduct and cause a permanent restriction.
 
- Software that bypasses the services in the game
- Programs that alter the game in any way (even if it is not for cheating)
- Cheats, macros, etc, for other games and not for PUBG, is still a violation of the game’s services."

3558,"If you'd like to spend 30 minutes looting, just to get 1 shot cross map and have absolutely no clue who killed you, download this game.

 If you'd like to sit in 1 spot for 45 minutes without doing anything even remotely fun, download this game.

If you're sick of sweaty games like warzone, apex, fortnite, etc. then don't bother with this game, it's the exact same. Except they don't have skill based matchmaking and 97% of the playerbase has played this game since release so you will get absolutely ass pumped in 90% of your gun fights unless you sneak up on someone or get a lucky 1 tap.

In all seriousness, this is the worst shooter I've ever played. The audio is atrocious, the matchmaking is atrocious, the flight system is atrocious, the fact that you have to reload a gun immediately after picking it up off drop is ridiculous, the cross compatibility with controller is brutal(just play KBM), graphics are  like xbox 360 cod graphics (potentially worse tbh)."

3707,"PUBG is a game about surviving on a quickly shrinking map with other 60-99 players. The game has around 6 different maps which differ in size and theme. 
There are 2 modes of playing:
- TPP which is the 3rd person shooter mode
- FPP which is the 1st person shooter mode (I recommend this one, it's much more dynamic)
The main goal of the game is surviving until you're the last team on the map alive. But to achieve this goal you should go through a several steps plan:
1. Pick a location where to jump from the plane
2. Search for weapons and equipment
3. Try to avoid the blue zone since it damages you
4. Pick good spots to kill other players and avoid being targeted

The game is full of running around from a location to another because the map is huge even for 100 players. The odds are that you'll rarely get past 5 kills because encounters aren't that frequent. The good part is that you're always in a kind of tension whether you'll find a player around the corner or whether the footsteps that you hear are of your teammate or an enemy.  
You'll miss a lot of kills in this game because the shooting is pretty realistic, weapons having different bullet speeds, bullets dealing less damage over greater distances, the bullets flying in a curved trajectory (especially for VSS which is a real bitch when shooting at distances over 200m)
There's also weapon upgrades and different miscellaneous items like drones, spike traps, C4 etc.
For the fans of survival shooters(or team shooters in general) recommended."

You get the occasional one, and the occasional toxic dude. But most people have been playing this game for 5 years so of course its a high skill cap against most teams. Devs still doing plenty of work with maps and can finally use the BP again with plenty of new skins available."

3742,Game was good. Now no good.
3743,"Great 'battle royale' shooter, that is unfortunately riddled with cheaters. (There are simple systems in place to report cheaters, but the post replay system shows considerably different from in game scenarios and death cam replays, so keep this in mind before reporting people as a knee-jerk reaction to getting slaughtered.

At present, we (South Africans) have a high ping and de-sync rate, as all servers are over-seas which leaves us vulnerable in close quarter situations. Anything under 50m and you're chances of getting murdered without mercy increase exponentially, which is a shame, because we'd probably give the international community a proper spanking with lower pings.

The maps are great, the spawning is alright, sometimes it's in your favour, and sometimes you're left wondering where it is, so the randomness of this mechanic is great. Some spots are better than others, and the Pro's/Level 500 players know it like the back of their hands, if not better.

Ultimately the game is really about 'luck of the draw' with a dash (or two) of skill. As long as you don't get hung up on having to loot and run quite a bit before getting some shots off, you'll enjoy this title. (Depending if you throw yourselves into the ""crucible of fire"" or not).  It can get frustrating at times (especially with some of the players that blatantly cheat) but you're not playing for those moments... You're chasing that Chicken dinner... and when you get it... It makes all the ""getting murdered"" so worth it.

Don't pay attention to the repeated dying and you'll be just fine with this game, enjoy the 'run and gun' of it all, skill up, get better, and for gawd's sake don't let the cheaters get the better of you... 

Hope to see you on the battlefields soon... 
preferably staring down the barrel of my gun. ;-D"

3754,Best Battle Royal Game. Supporter since the alpha release! #DebiDitched

3758,its aight
3759,literally every single game i've played except for the first one against bots there's been hackers
3760,nice games
3761,Mediocre i guess
3762,Game is OK.  Wish Bluehole would enhance their anti-cheating system.
3763,yes
3764,"When this game released it was an absolute shit show. Hackers, bugs, poor physics, no loot spawns, etc. Overtime blueballs has fixed many of the issues with the game. The biggest being the pricetag. Car physics are mostly fixed, hackers still exist but eac does a good job of getting rid of most of them, optimization is MUCH better, gun balance is pretty good, and its got the best gun play out of any other battleground. Most battlegrounds are shit so compared to most this is a good game. You can argue that Apex or Warzone are better but honestly its just which game's gameplay you like better at this point."
3765,Game is dead and full of cheaters.
3766,the game is bad so bad dont play and dont buy
3767,i like playing this game
3768,The volume of hackers in this game makes it virtually unplayable.
3769,its about worlds one of the most popular games and its billions of players even though im playing it for like 400 hour but i can tell this is the game where you can get new friends and competitor and about bad its the free account cheaters who is ruining the games i hope one day PUBG will comes up with a bettter solution for cheaters thats all so hope PUBG journey never stops
3770,"its fun some times

3771,"Ziemlich langatmig. Das beste ist, dass man sich fast nackt ausziehen kann. Da kommt laune auf. Aber nicht spoilern. Wer die Zeit hat, jeweils 30min irgendwelchen Kram zusammen zu suchen, um danach 30 Sekunden mit Johnny und Freddy einen kurzen Schlagabtausch zu haben, kann die Freizeit gerne in diesen Flipperautomaten ballern. Für mich ist das Spiel über weite Strecken einfach langweilig. Da stosse ich lieber Billiardkugeln übers Loch oder studiere mal 10min das Einkaufsregal bei uns im Supermarkt, was es wieder alles für tolle neue Nastücher hat. Dafür, dass es gratis ist, ist der Preis aber gut. Kann man sich in einer sinnfreien Minute mal gönnen. Peace."

If you are new to the game, the ""ranked"" version is behind a paywall, forcing you to play the ""normal"" gamemode, which makes NO attempt at matching you with players of similar skill levels; so when you, level 3, decide to hop into a game, you will inevitably be killed by a level 469 guy who does nothing but snort PUBG cocaine all day.

3934,"I bought this game in 2017 and it has somehow continued to be a cash grab for the developers and thats about it, they update the items to continue making money and leave the rest to die. I stopped playing this game in 2019 and came back last week to try it out in hopes things were better than expectations, instead the game crashes my entire computer and shuts it off involuntarily. The cheating, botting, consistent empty squad matches and hardware threatening crashes/bugs are a true testament to what this game and the gaming industry itself has turned into, cash grab trash; like this game. I wish I could take back the hours i put into this game and thats something you cant get back, save yourself the time."

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
4040,New accounts put up against level 500 accounts. Cringemax
4041,"used to be fun at the start... then they moved instead of fixing existing problems into adding more garbage into the game and made it esport. Now its chaotic slow paced game, which needs to be filled with bots and even after so many years the game crashes from time to time"
4042,"I tried this game a couple years ago when it was like $30 something.  I ended up getting a refund. LOL  I just yesterday gave it  another shot since it's now free.  They've added a LOT of content and over 100k players almost non-stop.  I really am enjoying it this time around.  I unlocked the full game in less than a day by completing some training missions.

Really looking forward to diving straight into it!"
4043,I liked this product.
4044,gay PUBG be like SUCKD
4045,lol
4046,"Terrible optimization, would not recommend"

4052,"whenever i watch a deathcam of myself dying, which is extremely often (100% of the time)
the enemies never seen to have there cross hair on me

4053,Game is broken. Can't complete training because the targets can't be hit. Training is stupid anyway because I've been playing this game for years!
4054,I want to respawn more and quicker in normal games.
4055,its ok.
4056,"I have about 450 hours on this game and have been playing before it went Free to Play. Overall I still like this game, but I do agree there are times where you do get killed by cheaters. Even though there are cheaters sometimes I still win many games. Playing this game for me is more of an experience with all the crazy stuff that happens rather then playing it like a competitive game. I stop playing and come back every once in a while to see what is new. This game has so much potential that unfortunately the developers have not really tapped into fully."
4057,most swatties game to ever exist

4062,Cool game. I play like a rat and enjoy it so much. I have my preferred rat holes I'm usually hiding at. Imagine just getting the kills why doing my thing on the toilet behind closed door then listening the kind words i get :-)
4063,"This game just sucks, even on all very low settings and Direct X 11 Enhanced I still couldn't manage to get good frames. Also, there are 2 different kinds of ads (aim down sights) so in the tutorial I got stuck in the shooting section because the devs couldn't manage to metion that. After I finished the tutorial, I was forced to PLAY 10 GAMES AGAINST BOTS until I could actually play against people, which I never got to do because the game is absolute ass. Every time I got shot at by a bot my mouse desynced and when I moved it my character look around 10 seconds behind where I actually was. I don't rage very often but this game was so fucking bad I scared my deaf dog."

4083,"Hundreds of players land on a huge map: with fields, forests, towns, villages, single houses and bridges. The route of the plane on which we arrive is different each time, and you can choose the moment for the jump yourself. We don’t have equipment: armour, weapons, first-aid kits, body kits for guns – everything needs to be looked for on the level, searching through the houses. Over time, an area is allocated on the map, which is gradually shrinking, all players outside it die rather quickly. The goal is to survive. Only one will remain. It's that simple."
4084,nice
4085,its a good game but you get with high leveled players. For example i have level 30 and i get with level 500 who just dominate me and its not fair.

4087,awesome game!!
4088,good game i like it more than mobile
4089,"PUBG was certainly a huge step in the evolution of Battle Royale games and I used to have a lot of fun with it.
That being said, the addition of bots really ruined the experience for me. It just feels so much less intense, when you know that you're playing against a computer, most of the time."

4098,"*note* its my first review so sorry for bad england im not a native user

Iv been playing this game since 2018 and have over 1000 hrs+.
 I have to say that random map pool locked is the worse choise pubg devs made. For me personally queuing for 10 min just to find a map I want to play is to much. I know that this feature is necessary for matchmaking and finding a game quicker. But hear me out there is still a room for change and making things a little better in this ""masterpiece"" of game.
Firstly take out tdm and casual mode they were fun at first but now they are kinda just there and just taking a slot in the matchmaking pool also, I personally bought this game for the br experience and not for good old tdm, I know i know its more for the ""new players"" (if there are any this days) and for warm ups and stuff but for this the practice range exist.

Secondly divide the map pool into 3 sections:
Mini royale: for a fast br experience ( maps like sanhok, karakin, paramo).
And regular br: for a more immersive br experience ( maps like Erangel ,Miramar , Taego ).
And the practice.

This little change might not help bcz the game is rotten to core but might make it more easy to queue up into your favorite map. Pls take note brendan."
4099,was once great now plays like a block of cheese. its gasrbo on pc and console waste your time on something else
4100,"Still crashes at this point in the stage? Terrible. Game has dropped in quality year after year. Thought I'd never turn my back on PUBG, but it's just not the same Battle Royal it used to be. Uninstalling for good."

4112,"This gam not good for my computer, i restart, no work, i reset, no work. I sit in the corner of my bed and cry because i cant play pubg, no point in living if i cant play pubg, my wife took kids, I lonely, i just want Pubg, fun game to play but Pc no play gam.

4120,"After spending this amount of time (with test server time, probably more than 1000 hours, more than 800 on this title) on this game since the early beginning, there is no way I'm going to be willingly forced to go through the childish training requirements. I have no idea why the developer would choose to do this. Wanted to jump into PUBG for a few rounds of nostalgic games, but ""No, you're not allowed"". I don't know if the game still holds up, since it's slow at loading and I had to kill the game through task manager last time I attempted to play it. Goodbye, we had some good times together."

Death-cam affirms with Snap Aim, No recoils, instant head shots,  obviously sight through wall in some cases (suspected), and I'm sure those no skill players have other stupid hacks as well... This is only 1 day of many like this, as I continued to try and play past it in absolute vain...

If you get this game, do not spend money on it, until they resolve the hacking problems.

Looking past the Hacking... the game is fairly well balanced in terms of Weapon types, attachments, support items, etc... If only they got rid of the hackers - maybe ""Hardware BAN"" would solve this sooner than later."

4237,"With every 2 steps they take going in a forward direction they take 3 steps back.  The new map is outstanding with decent improvements like increased loot, drone applications, more vehicles, ect.  The game still feels like dogshit in movement, STILL no revive mechanic, frustrating gunplay, red zones that NO ONE wants, awful sound system, no trio's option....  Unfortunately they really don't care do fix anything cause no one is buying the game in 2022, so it's only ever going to be cosmetic items and new maps from here on till the game fully dies.  Sad because this game could be better and compete still all the big BR's right now but the developer just seems content with milking it's dwindling fanbase with micro-transactions till the day they shut down the servers.  :("

Not a single cheater I reported recently got banned!!! WTAF!F! The last arcade mode I played, that cheater got 70 kills. If I didn't see his name TisDaniel get banned, I'll delete this game."

4249,"super good game

4250,i seriously dont like the fact you have to play 10 matches with AI before being allowed to play with real players. i was also kicked out of two matches about halfway through. its very buggy and takes too long to get to the actual game
4251,2022 and there's no skilled based mm in this game? Since when is a level 6 playing against level 500 sweatlords acceptable?
4252,Its fun if you play with friends
4253,"No hype here... This is a cleverly constructed Money funnel. Most pro level players you will encounter in-game are bots. It's structured to get you to just make that first transaction. If you are playing this without being paid to do so, get out now, it's a trap!"
4254,ironically the mobile version is better
4255,its a very good and entertaining shooting game don`t believe me ? see for yourself

4261,"Game crashes randomly, I have BT fibre and a 1080 Nvidia GPU, but get let down by this poorly optimised trash game"
4262,"After almost 500-hrs I decided  it was a good time to put my review here.

It is a game I enjoy but not enough to play by myself. Scripters, wallhackers, the lack of content( that IT COULD DEFINITELY), and a NA community that I wish was as strong as EU or Asia(ranked in NA is very limited). These are some  reasons why I have put down the game multiple times. My friends are the only reason why I keep playing.

PUBG could be so much more if there was interest from the developers. Add Free-for-all to the arcade, or any other modes, not just team death match. Constant events with  meaningful rewards would keep me more engaged in the game. Or at least skins related to a known team that constantly plays in the torunaments. 

TLDR; Okay game if your friends are good, not enough to keep a loner entertain."
4263,"This game isnt too bad overall. It has its slight issues, etc. I would recommend this game overall"

it is actually really fun"
4284,Surprisingly not a lot of cheaters. Lots of good players. Worthy to upgrade if you like the gameplay. Gunfights are skill-based. Positioning is very important so is knowing your opponent and knowing the gun you're using.
4285,goddamn f2p rn wtf is this?
4286,hu uh
4287,I highly recommend this game but its only fun if you have a friend or a group of friends to play it with you it gets boring after a while if you keep playing solos and thats all i have to say

4298,Very nice game

4300,I have 254 hours in the game and they tried to make me do a mandatory tutorial when I wanted to play it again after taking a break for a while. What dweeb dev thought that was a good idea? It's an hour+ of gameplay or doing some lame objectives that probably take 20 minutes when I want to game with my boy. Garbage game just because devs make decisions like that.

4309,"The game mechanics are great and it can be very addicting to play. However, this game has a SEVERE issue with cheaters.  I've encountered cheaters in almost every Solo First Person match I've played in the last 35ish hours. I've tried reporting a ton and even recorded them and submitted it to the PUBG website. These cheaters go completely unchecked and ruin the competitive game... I'll go play a game where the cheaters are few and far between and I can get enjoyment out of it for a change."

4374,"Most multiplayer shooters make conflict inevitable and frequent. Battlegrounds, better known as  stretches time and space in a way that makes combat almost optional."
4375,"Cheating is a crime, happens every day.....

That is the mantra of this game currently it seems because if you want to be sniped or clipped through buildings from an unforeseen enemy that apparently can send a bullet through the front door, up the stairs, around the corner, into the bedroom and straight up the crack of your khakis without any audio warning than this is the game for you! This game was alright for a hot minute but you soon found yourself being sniped by people you will never see and sometimes this is genuine good players, other times it is people shooting through mountains! Server issues were present but not overbearing, matchmaking was relatively quick but the pacing of each match would either be a short burst of violence early on or dropping into abandoned territory and looting for an eternity, running marathons to find players and then getting sniped or engaging in a trade-off with some speck in the distance. It becomes old fast and to be honest there are much better games out now that this becomes a chore to play, so for that reason I am outta here! Good luck if you still play this!"
4376,"This game is full of cheaters and PUBG isnt doing anything about it. You always encounter a lvl 500 with automatic aim. There is nothing you can do cuz the report system isnt really looking in to the rports of all the reports ive made where ppl clearly has auto aim one has been ""temporarily banned"" the game is now so broken that if u want to win u need to cheat dont play it."

Massive frame drops and low frame rate in general, despite me having a decent upper mid-range PC on [b]lowest graphics settings[/b]. I doubt the game will get updated to fix these issues anytime soon, so I suppose I'll turn back to the kitchenware-inspired knockoff for a better experience."

4532,"About the game: This game is perhaps... the first significant battle royale (royal battle) since the rise of the genre.  The temptation of the general concept, the cheerfulness of the gameplay in the first couple, lured a huge number of people to conquer and survive, among others, in restricted areas.  The developers had it all: the fame, the money, the media attention and the opportunities that came with it.  What did the developers of the game do with fallen happiness?  No, they didn’t polish the game to perfection so that people wouldn’t be afraid to crash out of the game or not load into the match at all, they didn’t fix the crooked animation and general outdated graphics (hello, the plane that still “throws out” people through a closed cargo hold  ), did not work for the community in such a way that even free players would have a sense to get something from the battle pass, where only a fig is in store for them, and even then without oil.  As a result, we only have that over the past years they have diligently filled the store with donated items, sold half-empty passes, and sometimes pleased with a new map or a fresh patch, that's all.  They could still compete in popularity with the late fortnite-ohm, only if they didn’t try to immediately extract all the money from the players, forgetting to work on bugs, but diligently engaged in improving the quality of the product to modern industry standards.  Only with a stretch this review will have a recommendatory character, because with all the residual pleasantness, being in a campaign of friends, from spending time in the game, it is impossible to close your eyes to a huge number of flaws, disregard for those who did not bring it and just to those who are thirsty for a decent  product to the players.
 Strengths:
 + Pleasant, realistic style of the environment
 + Detailed character models
 + Acceptable range of weapons and vehicles
 + In the campaign of friends, quite peppy gameplay, if you do not start farming in the mode with bots
 + Not bad music in the main menu (includes all tracks from the very release of the game)
 + A huge number of skins for the character and weapons... just either pay a lot or collect for years :)
 + Low product price until the end of 2021, free from 2022
 Weak sides:
 - Noticeably outdated level of graphics and animation of objects
 - Curvature of control at the level of old games
 - Poor optimization with the possibility of a crash during a match
 - Extremely poor battle pass
 - High prices in the store, especially for our market
 ============================
 Final score from me: 6/10
 Recommended for review: Those who want to run with a campaign for a couple of months in the father of the royal games... and then, just as quickly, run away to conquer other projects"

4706,"Lets face it. PUBG is the worst Battle Royale on the market. From the numerous bugs/glitches, the god awful servers, clunky character movements, it is really no mystery why this game barely breaks even for player satisfaction. No skill based matchmaking, squads don't auto fill or auto balance at all, hackers in roughly 3 of the 5 matches you will play, no real training system to learn the game, and after 19 seasons it is quite obvious that the developers have no interest in making their game playable/enjoyable. But don't worry, give them some money, and you can have a few cosmetic items to make up for the joke that is PUBG. 1/10"
4707,i dont like battle royale games
4708,"This game is overwhelmed by hackers! 
Every second match you go head-to-head against a hacker. Either aim assist or wh or both. 
Yes, you can see the death cam but in-game reporting is broken (in the end of the report a network lag detection error appears for a split second)
. There is a report protection provided by the hack program and hackers can also see when someone is spectating them and ""suddenly"" they act like dumb noobs. After checking the long replay file you see all the sus activity. 
Only way how to truly report a hacker is trough submitting a ticket, but it means u need to upload a video and this is way too long process. 
Until this issue remains, I don't recommend this game. No fun."

4737,"Been playing PUBG since Early Access in 2017, I've taken breaks here and now, but can say that I am still impressed with the game overall. They have continued to improve and innovate the game over the years, keeping it fresh and fun. I'm sure cheaters/hackers will always be a rampant thing in any BR or competitive shooter so it's hard to give negative feedback to others who will play the game. Just know, you will run into a hacker at some point. If you are looking for a fun BR with a more realistic feel with the gun play and TTK then look no further, PUBG does it best IMO still.

4839,"I am eager to confirm that this game is a prime example of making the game worse throughout its development in every single aspect except optimisation. If you are looking forward to fighting mini skirt bears and some cringe ass anime attired folks you are in the right place. From a very promising game that was lacking just those frames and some balancing it has fallen down the spiral of total garbage. They are making the game so easy with all those pings and shit. Why would I need a compass if I can ping every single ass in this server and half of them are bots anyways. what. a. shame. Its so bad, you can't even fix this shit anymore, just leave it. And also, who the fuck came up with the dumb fucking idea to give a player with 1000+ hours a fucking tutorial match. Bruh.

Don.t download or play this game it is utter trash, call of duty, fortnite or variant would be a better pick pic. p.s. fuck the devs for ruining my favorite battle royal game"

The game in it's current form is filled with cheaters, jaw droppingly priced micro transactions and a convoluted unlockable cosmetic system. With all of the other battle royal games on the market there is no reason to keep playing this dying game. They put it on life support with bots and free to play and at the end the only thing that did was make it a watered down form of what it once was."

4908,FUN
4909,This game has a great setting and feeling of fighting for your life but the ways you can play are a different story they are really random. One game you can have a great responding team and the other is either full of no mic players/ not knowing how to enable mic and heavy team killing with newer players not understanding how the game works. I do recommend this game but this can get really boring and time wasting finding teammates.

These f!@#ing people on here ruin the game for anyone who likes a legit challenge with fair gameplay. No one likes to run around for 2 seconds just to watch your own kill cam of some d&*k head snaping on to you like some gaming leach to ruin the fun.

4982,"ughhh..where to start..this game is ideal for a particular person like a battle royal without 'builds'

apart from the level 500's just *destroying* your will to live, this game can be fun if you play it 'right', hot drops and just fighting.
7/10"
4983,"Too many cheater, map hack, wall hack, aim hack and speed hack. I lose count of how many time that i almost got Chicken Dinner but always got  wasted by cheater who used auto aim and shooted from impossible angle. PUBG was one of my favorite game but now it 's a trash."
4984,"I am genuinely shocked that a game that's been out this long, is so narrowly minded in focus, so afraid of it's player base as to deny them legitimate avenues for enjoyment (i.e. custom zombie bot maps) and so broken with respect to disconnections, that anyone could consider this game 'good.' There is absolute amazing potential with this game, there is no doubt about that - this is in my opinion what people play PUBG for, the theoretical presentation of the game.

Cheaters make Ranked an unfortunate joke. I don't understand how this game cannot compensate players who are killed by players who are banned or even temp banned (ANY suspicion should be enough) to have their lost Ranked points returned or be credited with some amount. Ranked is also complicated by the insane choice to region lock areas and still produce no way for players to have any clear idea as to those who might want to play locally - hence no one in Australia is able to play locally. How could this be solved? Oh, I don't know...maybe an active count / tally that is public so people can see X number of people want to play ranked and are pseudo queued up to play it > compromises can be made as to FPP/TPP though hell, if you are obsessed with your 100 player count (no longer a healthy player base in Australia), why don't you simply compromise?! At 20 players, start a match! Make it a smaller and faster circle situation. There is no way to standardise 100 players in maps anymore. That time is over.

Ranting more about the cheaters, I personally feel sorry for people who want to win at all costs and can literally trick themselves into thinking they've accomplished something by doing so...Though again, this could be solved by allowing players freedom and choice - such as with custom lobbies, managed locally (therefore effectively) to screen for cheaters, with those found cheating, kicked out for good. PUBG cannot reliably implement an anti-cheating system in the face of the money these companies seem to make, so again, with a valid solution available, the decision is to do nothing but release updates with silly new maps and more hollow, click-bait item purchases.

PUBG could be great. It could be. However there is far too much fear and a complete disconnect apparent in terms of what is considered enjoyment vs methods of monetising."
4985,no

4988,best of best game
4989,"oh oh oh, 30GB+ of garbage 

Optimization is a word that the developers forgot to add to their head, because it is not in the game.

Every major update = constant game crashes. You might get lucky and get to play 1 game, but after that .... The game crashes during the game, then the game crashes when you fly in an airplane, then the game crashes at startup.
Only a complete reinstallation helps, but every time you download 30GB+ of this garbage - there is no desire.

The game was great at the time of release, but then they removed the exchanges, started adding a bunch of things that you need to buy for dollars, in short, they deal with the question: ""how to get more money""

In general, I deleted it and there is no desire to run it anymore."

Player Unknown's Battlegrounds: Battlegrounds is a torture method.

This game is so fucking bad. Winning does not feel like you achieved victory. When you win there is no music, no sound effect, just monotone text repeating ""Winner winner Chicken dinner"". There is nothing enjoyable in this game, nothing satisfactory. It feels like a chore.

Chivalry 1 is somehow more enjoyable than this.

5043,"Coming over from Apex. I can say I would rather play this then that buggy unappreciated pile of trash. Here is my take on the Updated PUBG. Amazing. Gave this game a whole new QoL. Opening up so much to a MP world. These gun fights are in comparable to any other games except Rainbow Six. After adding some new perm game modes like tdm, + a whole new map and more features/content. The Ranked System is interesting, pay to get in making it where if you wanted to cheat, you'd get banned forcing you to make a new account but also spending another $12. I would say PubG could be making its comeback into the scene if they can keep this kind of changes up. Worth a try at least and is definitely a great change of pace if you are sick of Apex"

5067,"Mixed feelings...
- Very satisfying gunplay, very large maps... exactly what I imagined a battle royale game would be like.
- Casual play (12 players, 88 bots) limited to only 3x per day. Some of us actually want to have fun and not just be shot in the back from someone we can't see 300 metres away.
- Matchmaking and teamwork is all over the place... almost nobody communicates, very few people speak English, German or French. I can never find players who were fun to play with on the Steam community... very strange.
- Less cheating than I expected."

5093,"I decided to reinstall the game last week after not having played since late 2017. I missed playing battle-royales and I wanted to see how much PUBG had changed since I started playing. I logged in, reacquainted myself with the game by doing the training, and some games against the AI. The next day I found myself banned from the game. WTH? I'm not a cheat. I don't hack, I don't use third-party programs at all, but banned. Support told me that there was no reversing it and nothing could be done. Very disappointing. It's not even worth creating a new account. Thanks for giving me a reason never to play again."

Nachtrag: Grafik ist zum weinen, wirklich es gibt Half Life 1 Mods die schöner sind, nicht gerade dass die Grafik Assets aus dem Unity Store geklaut sind. Sound is na ja... immerhin haben sie hinbekommen, dass die Richtung der Geräusche stimmt.

Intro kann man nicht abbrechen, nervt, da das Game sich häufig selbst beendet, was wohl der Versuch einer höheren Macht ist mir zu sagen ich soll was spaßiges machen."

Then, after a year, you removed ranked and added bots to the matchmaking, that completely destroyed this game for me and other solo players. Years later we still don't have a decent BR alternative, you have all the money, online and player's love in the world to bring back this game mode and remove bots with just a few lines of code and I will play this game 24/7. For years now I'm scanning the patch notes for this and developers mercilessly refusing me and others. All I see in patch notes are endless maps, battlepasses, skins, events, that absolutely no one looking forward too.

5191,"good game get bad fps 
"
5192,"I have been playing this game since it's release, and I can't bring myself to play for more than 2 matches. The maps are fun, yet the mobility in the game doesn't fit the map sizes. Too many bots in every match make this game seem like its dead. Add respawns after death, or speed up the player movements to match the map sizes. I spend more time looting and walking (driving) around theses big maps, than seeing or even hearing other REAL players. The game devs have been too idle with these visable and yet simple issues. Add a higher total player count for each match to 150 or reduce the map sizes to enable more player v player interactions. This game is on it's last leg, and tbf I hope it does die if these devs don't put some actual work into this game. This is what happens when your mod teams don't play the game as a fan, but rather do it as a job."
5193,"I've rarely seen a game get progressively worse and worse and worse than I have with PubG. 

The devs abandoned the NA community, added stingy/greedy season passes which barely give any good loot without upgrading it a bunch of times, added bots and for the final death knell they made it free to play and made it a cheater's paradise. 

This game went from god tier to trash tier, and it was all the devs' doing."

5218,"1500+ hours played and still going strong. There're so many different BRs to play, so why choose PUBG instead of any other?
Yeah, the game does have it's bugs, crashing randomly and lack of monnthly/quaterly content updates, buuuuuuuuuuut! There's nothing like the feeling of pulling up with your squad, communicating and coordinating attacks to kill the enemy - and finally being rewarded with a delicous chicken dinner :D
PUBG isn't the most fast paced game, you can't build walls, you can't build weapons and far from all maps let you get back into the game after dying - but it's one of the better ""realistic"" BR shooters in my opinion :)"

5222,"Not recommending anymore. As good as it was in old days it just tries to be something it is not. Taking stupid gameplay mechanics from other games to look cool and bring more money in. Pubg was unique. Parashooting from building anytime is just next COD. Ascending is just next APEX. Add building and you will have Fortnite. If I would want those mechanics I would go play those games because they have much better visuals. But I don't. Should have aimed for the e-sports, and focus on bugs in already best maps ever Erangel/Miramar. The new adition of Deton does not even feel as pubg anymore. Miramar might have more land but it definetly has less buildings and trees and it feels much smaller than Deton."

- EXTRA INFORMATION -
➼ It can be repetitive as most battle Royale's are and there isn't much variety in the gunfights, but especially since the game was made free-to-play, it's definitely worth downloading if you haven't before! Graphics aren't too much of an issue as lots of people set their graphics to low on a lot of options for increased competitive advantage, in which these setting require very little from a machine. Playing with friends is definitely more fun than alone, which is what I'm basing the experience off of. There's a good enough ratio of winning - losing in public games where it doesn't feel easy but it isn't repetitively difficult every game and you feel like you'll never win.

Happy Hunting!"
5269,Whatever happened to this Game. Used to really enjoy it but can´t play it now since i can´t be bothered to play those forced tutorials and AI Games. I have over 600 hours of Playtime. Bruh!

I highly rate anything that commits to the bit that hard, truly a comic masterclass."

5307,Nice game wit some bugs.
5308,i JUST INSTALLED THIS GAME AND I WAS PLAYING ON TRAINING GROUNDS. I EXITED THE MATCH THEN LATER WHEN I LOGGED IN IT IS SHOWING BANNED WHAT THE HACK IS THIS.
5309,"0 distinguishing characteristics from a legion of other identical games, none of which are enjoyable in the slightest."
5310,"nice , but after every update game crashes"
5311,"Nice meet some people from many nations,,,"
5312,had fun with this game when it first game out. saw it was getting some updates so i figured i would give it another go after not playing for a long while. Log in and even though I have 239 hours in this game i now need to play 10 AI matches before i can play the actual game. GTFO with that shit. not worth it. uninstalling again.
5313,"Movement janky, looting janky, was fun back in the day but its not good now."
5314,Better than Warzone.

5319,idk how is it possible to make a shooter that feels so slow
5320,"worse call of duty warzone, and thats saying something."
5321,One of the best and also have player base not have to wait for your match to start in lobby!!
5322,"Use your wits in conjunction with the environment to outmaneuver and conquer your enemies. Stalk, hide, escape on foot or by stumbled upon vehicles that are randomly placed thoughout the map.
Find supplies and weapons to survive and be the soul survivor. 
Use the available options to play solo, team up or play solo against teams to out smart / out-flank / corner your enemies with a no mercy approach because unfortunately, it is only kill or be killed... and stay ahead of the blue zone for the blue zone is certain death!"
5323,"I played through the tutorial and this is just not a game for me, i'm not saying it's bad.
I just think other games are more fun then PUBG."

5328,"I would never recommend this game to anyone. The cheating problem in this game is insane. And KRAFTON will never give any fucks bout cheaters since all they care about is money. 
If you like being shot through walls and insta hs'd from 300 meters without having even .1 second to respond sure, go ahead. 
But be warned, this game only wants your money."
5329,better than warzone
5330,Wtf it's free now? What kind of bullshit is this!
5331,shit game lol
5332,<3
5333,"pubg be more like bug and crash simulator. imagin playing full squad, game crashes without any noticable reason, you try to reconnect and get some useless error, no reconnection possible. this occurs in about 2 of 5 games, not just for me but also for all of my mates.
In case you dont already have enough, the game provides you with a series of various bugs and glitches e.g. cars randomly jumping over invisible edges, unused cars sinking into the ground, vaulting does not trigger so you end up jumping in front of windows instead of getting into the house while trying to escape the enemy.
The whole movement can be considered pure pain.

AND THE  ABSOLUTE WORST PART IS THAT THESE ISSUES EXIST ALMOST SINCE THE BETA. AND INSTEAD OF FIXING THIS SHIT, ALL THE PLAYERS GET IS A FUCK TON OF MICROTRANSACTIONS, BATTLEPASSES, LOOTBOXES AND USELESS SKINS THAT DO NOTHING THAN SPAM YOUR STARTING SCREEN. (the menu is btw the worst ive ever seen.. go ahead and try to change your profile banner. I bet it will take you at least 5 minutes to even find the option)"

5344,"Awesome game!
Realistic graphics and gameplay
This game is for real man that they only thing they met in their lifes was pain.
I just wanted to say that PUBG is not forgiving any mistakes you can make.
You just need a lot of time playing to understand what you gotta do and how you gotta move (especially if u r unxperinced at fps games).
The last six months i don't wanna play anything else.
Of couse this game is extremply fun and satifying while playing co-op with your friends!

5348,"Prank caller: Hey is your PUBG running? *tries to contain laughter*
Me: No.

5349,Has sucked ever since they took away voice chat out of pre-game lobby.
5350,getting kills are still satisfying in this game after 300+ hrs. game is too fun

5355,yup um good

5358,balls
5359,fun game if ur good (unlike me)
5360,very nice
5361,"it just crashes. over and over again. each update makes it crash again. I used to play this game on it's early access because it was kinda fun and challenging, it also gave money back selling crates in the community market. the ""casual mode"" took away most of the challenge but the fun and the crates was still there, then the crashing updates begin. each time a major update was released I wasn't able to play until it was fixed with a minor one, that took away the fun, so the only thing that was still there for me was the crates. this update deleted the crates, and when I tried to play the crashes not only were still there, it didn't let me connect to the match again, that made me rage, uninstall the game and promise to never play this crap again.

DONT PLAY THIS SHIT, FUCK YOU GOLD DIGGER DEVELOPERS."
5362,oi
5363,i got crash many times no reason
5364,"If you kill or even shoot at a Streamer, devs gave them the power to ban you on the spot for a month, if it was intentional or not, with or without proof. Don't even bother playing."
5365,it gud
5366,"I only play this game for like 8 minutes and this game took too long to load into training match and I look at my task manager and I have my GPU up to 99% and CPU up to 27% and memory up to 36% and My PC sound like jet taking off and plus this game does not have any patches to make good this 5 years old game does not run smoothly.                                                              

This game give me an error on Steam. this game is in horrible state and but condition and too slow and poor quality theses Developers thinking everything fine but in reality is not. I am upset and mad, FIX your game KRAFTON, the game is garbage not good like they use to. 

and also This game I tried to go to a basic training match and it failed so I want to settings and I low my graphics down and worked but only for basic training but except for AI training match and Training because I keep getting the connection timeout I tried to lower the settings and it keep getting me error messages This game has an issue NO matter what PC you have The game can issue bugs and slow internet I recommend Do not download this game"

5372,If you like dying 90% of the time to cars then you will love this game
5373,.
5374,Awesome game had so many good times with friends in this game. A++
5375,Every time this game updates it breaks my client and keeps dropping me from games after they launch. killing my ratings in the game really a fail on the devs side to upload updates properly misses files all the time and just seriously broken.
5376,very guuud very nice
5377,great Game

5380,every season nothing changes still the worst br around with terrible hit boxes and absolutely boring gameplay only took one game to uninstall again done with pubg
5381,"this game is garbage,i figured id give it another chance and re download it...game cant even run AT ALL,i have a very nice pc that runs everything like butter..not this steaming pile of shit tho. stay as far away from this game as u can. this company should be sued for everything they have and then some for this"
5382,"+ Always new updates on the horizon
+ Fun, thrilling and exciting gameplay

- Animation of models is not very smooth
- You do have the occasional server issue, but not to a degree where it happens often

Score: 8/10"

5384,Good Game and graphics just the crashing on my GTX 970 Turbo 2gig but should perform better when i upgrade soon ;-)
5385,Didnt like it before but for some reason i like it now.
5386,Still one of the best FPS games out there. If you're having problems with tarkov's inertia and the slowed gameplay I could not recommend pubg enough. It is the same tactical shooter except with faster paced gameplay than tarkov ever was.
5387,PUB-A-G MOBILE
5388,YES

Thats a shame since the game itself has potential to offer great fun but if you would want to play ""ranked"" so you dont meet the toxic overleveled smurfs u gotta plaz in squads qhich means u face atleast 4 people at a time who can still be lvl 500 or just smurfing on their 5th accounts......i hate this game for a reason, and wont touch it untill it gets fixxed in a waz that casual plazers like me can enjoz it again.

5413,Enjoy this game. Ranked matches are awesome.
5414,in 2022 this game is still one of the best battle royales despite its low graphic detail the mechanics are great still got a ton of player base i do not think this game is dying off anytime soon it outranks some of my favorite battle royale games depending on the day gotta be in a pubg mood but once you start playing it its hard to stop the only downside is the game has multiple maps and you cannot choose which one you want to play on its random map only that would be my only complaint and why i put the game down sometimes and go back to blackout or warzone.
5415,Still the best FPD and BR. No other game gives gun play like this.

From Australia I need to use a VPN to connect to Asia & play on 120 ping whenever I feel like playing a competitive game which isn't filled with 80+ AI bots. Developers also need to put more effort into game optimization.. What ever happened to Unreal Engine 5? Worth trying with friends if you haven't now that it's F2P

5567,"The gather and survive design of the game is great.  However, there are so many hackers in the game, the game's intent of competitive survival is ruined.  There are players or hackers who can take 10 times more damage than everyone else or no damage at all even when they are right in the cross-hairs (all aiming factors accounted for). This is either from hacking or an advantage the company provides to players who can afford to pay."

That's my main complaint about this game, the fully automatic weapons aren't actually full auto... if you try to spray them you will be playing limbo cuz the recoil will bend you backwards."

5605,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

Don't tell me you're too blind to see
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry

5685,The fact that this game forces you to do a bunch of A.I. matches on top of training before you can actually play is a beyond waste of time. I uninstalled the game since me and my friends couldn't play together to completing the crap training they are forcing on people. The game was a lot better in the beginning. At this point they have better options that let you play with friends right away. I would skip this one.
5686,"Fun

5687,"Are you guys fucking retarded or something???? I played this game 260hours when i BOUGHT it. Now its for free and i have to play a tutorial AND 10 AI matches?????????? What the fuck did you guys smoke?

Not even that .... I was forced to play the tutorial.
Also im using a GTX 1060 6GB, 16GB of RAM and I7-8700 and it keeps crashing on lowest settings telling me i dont have enough memory. Even though this is the recommended graphics card for the game!"
5688,love the game
5689,Its no more fun on this game...

5692,Very good game.
5693,fix your anti cheat
5694,"I decided to boot up the game to relive some good ol' PUBG memories. Unfortunately, after starting the game I realized that I was locked behind, not 1, but 3 game tutorial modes that I NEEDED to complete before playing... Not only do I have 361 hours on this game already, I purchased the game for $40.00 when it first came out. So I closed the game and left this review  in 1 minute instead of wasting 20 minutes ""learning how to ADS and revive a teammate""."
5695,So glad they made it free

5705,Yeah it's a great game with 9/10 for graphics and then I give it an h/10 for teamwork and it's 3/10 for originality and actually it's going to be a 9/10 for the graphics so the overall experience is 22/10 which I had such a good experience that I would in fact expose this game to all of my friends and family members who I still love very dearly but they were all killed by someone not long after I started playing this game.
5706,It would be really cool if the player would move faster like in PUBG mobile PC and would pick-up all necessary accessories automatically

5717,"There was a time when this game was amazing, had a very innovative way of spawning on the map and also huge maps full of loot, with lots of areas to explore and get in to proper PvP.

You can see that the player count is going down because they released a 65 player map and for the last week, I have been playing every day and it is only that map. There are not enough players to fill the big maps anymore...It has turned in to a typical rush to kill type of game where now strategy works except find a weapon, any weapon  and shoot everything that moves.

Sad..."

5746,"The concept of this game is excellent. However, playing the game is a complete disappointment unless you're willing to pay or give up hours/days training to play the game. I've put 25 hours into this game and the last four games I played, I wandered the map for over twenty minutes and was killed by the first person I encountered. It's depressing, considering how much fun I had playing the game against the training bots when I still stood a chance. But I can't play against bots anymore, only people that slaughter me immediately. Again, the concept of the game is so awesome, but playing the game is disheartening."

5770,"I am a 56 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing PUBG. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son recently started playing PUBG. After less than a week, he already had 20 hours of playtime. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account to play with my Son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game since the 90's, so i was quite lost. I asked my Son for help and together we spend hours playing PUBG. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my Son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. PUBG reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

5850,"ill let yall know if this shit is still cheater-ified be back in a few hours
Conclusion: it is very good, i recommend yes yes
edit: i got gamebanned for cheating, conclusion: if i did it, others are doing it."
5851,Games needs HIGH end hardware hence i'll not recommend it to normal players
5852,"i estimate the player base to be 50% or greater cheaters
I've been playing FPS games since the 90's, aimbot and wallhack have been around since then, and some how miraculously, the dev's at PUBG, despite going to great lengths to publicly enumerate the ways they are combating the problem still can't seem to stop cheaters?
inconsistent unreliable ballistic physics, and I suspect replete with exploits
I went back and looked through various chatrooms, etc, and one of the most consistent complaints I see about this game is that the mechanics are bafflingly inconsistent. The devs have insisted that they are fixing this. They have insisted for 5 years at least. I started playing less than 6 months ago, and I can pretty much spot bad net code, lag, and desync, when I see it... If this is the best they can do after 5 years. Well, my mama always used to say if you can't say nothin nice don't say nothin at all. Actually fuck that. As long as idiots are happy to shell out cash for lame ass vanity crap, the devs I'm sure will happily collect their checks, and not really do anything about it.
Speaking of which, the vanity items in this game, are lame as hell, agonizingly grindy to earn, unless you got lots of disposable income...
In short this game is high risk, low reward, with a bewildering vanity menu system, inconsistent, unreliable fps mechanics, that seem to magically work incredibly well for some and leave others unable to hit the broadside of a barn while being one shot head shotted from 500 yds by a dude jumping off a moving vehicle, (I watch kill cams religiously), but the graphics are good. One day I can play solo against teams, and come in second place, next day, I can't land a point blank shot to save my life. Literally. 
if my wife wasn't obsessed with it, and didn't nag me to play with her and her friends, i would never touch this game again, it is so inconsistent. Which is really sad, I wanted to like this game. Alot. I wrote to customer support, and voiced my concerns. They actually replied. Shockingly. I felt it was a well written reply until I went back and looked at past criticisms of the game, then I realized it was copy pasted from responding to the same criticisms for the last five years or so...
"
5853,"every time that i report someone as a cheater, you are not sending me any feedback about the player. i am an honest player, but with such a big comunity of them, its hard to play.

also, the game isnt going so smooth as it should be from the begining.
at the start, the game went great and now its stuck sometimes and crashes.

third, why dont you open more arcade games and more maps so we can play without random maps that i want to play over and over???"

5864,"thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”

6Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 7If you really know me, you will know b my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”

8Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.”

9Jesus answered: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? 10Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. 11Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves. 12Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 13And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.

Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit

15“If you love me, let me go, If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
'Cause these words are knives and often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart

This is gospel for the vagabonds
Ne'er-do-wells and insufferable bastards
Confessing their apostasies
Led away by imperfect impostors

This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart

Don't try to sleep through the end of the world and bury me alive
'Cause I won't give up without a fight

If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
'Cause these words are knives and often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

The fear of falling apart
The fear, the fear of falling apart

(This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
(This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart

This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

5871,"Absolute dog shit. I have tried to play this game for a while now, and all you get is a f****ng hammering every time your ping is below ""the threshold"". ID Software managed to get this stuff (=network gaming) right 21 years ago...

I gave it a good shot, as can be seen on the hours played.

Never touching this crap ever again.

Also, hope the devs never get hired to do any coding that requires networking."

5893,"Best BR when it first came out. Turned more into a loot and die over 40 minutes. Realistic somewhat gameplay with bullet drop and armor etc.  Vehicles are key --- would be great to have even smaller maps with no vehicles. Love to play this on mobile too.  Still some of the best times gaming were playing this game.  Stressful if u want it to be when you first drop-- But always a nailbiter until the Chicken Dinner is served. Perhaps more events, contests and skin drops will bring more players back?"

5904,"Highly non-moderated community. The only way to play competitive, serious games is to buy the premium version of the game and get access to ranks, I suppose. But this is a speculation as I would rather buy a real tactical game that's not a run and gun mindlessly.

I can't believe I say this, but from what I have seen the mobile version is more competitive than this one."
5905,"This game somehow does not understand it, when I want to play in a Squad. Because every time, I am either alone, or with one other player. Until this is fixed, it can not get my recommendation"
5906,"If you are a regular casual player or you have never played pubg before then this will be a great place to suffer. The game has two game modes from 3rd person and from 1st person, both options are shit, if you play from 3rd person you will be greeted by a bunch of newbies with with which you can compete, but there are also level 500 players who use the possibilities of 3rd person to the maximum and will rat you, so you will not be able to visit locations like bootcamp, school, hacienda and not be killed by another rat that looks out for you 3rd person. In the game from 1 person, the situation is different but not better, here you will be destroyed by crowds of experienced level 500 players who know every millimeter and the features of the game. And if you still want to play it, then you will have to suffer a lot and become the same nerd as most in this game.
Also, people are talking about cheaters, but I can’t say anything because it’s honestly difficult for me to distinguish a pro player from a cheater.
+ The game just looks outdated compared to other representatives of the genre
But I still like this s*it"

5909,"im starting to consider going back to console just for a non hacker game, literally the past 6 months EVERY game you have to beat atleast 1 cheater. been on the pubg platform since launch and on pc last 2 years daily aim lab for what? just hackers, would love to pay $5/month for guaranteed clean matches, even if it means letting pubg scan my files to double check for clean pc, i wish the devs would seriously choose actual skill over active player base.... sick and tired of this warzone like hacker squads, literally the only thing different is theres no slide cancels."
5910,its all about how fast you can leave the game and click on ready again.
5911,"After all its battle royal i most often come back to.
A lot of good memories from beginning of this game.

I would love to see competitive also for solo games that works :D plsss"
5912,"I got a 4 day ban for playing too well. Never have I ever cheated or hacked on a game. I opened a ticket and they closed it basically saying too bad we arent looking into your complaint. I paid for this game years ago, what a weird thank you."

5958,nope.
5959,I have many hours in this game and it has honestly been very fun to play with my friends mainly Vinny and Rocco and Justin and other friends of course but those are just the ones I can remember I like to do challenges like pistols only or no armor and stuff like that and go around the map on the outermost road in each map but its pretty cool to play I don't play it as much as I used to but I still come back to it with my friends all the time and it is really fun to run squads and stuff and each time I come back I think I get better so I like to keep playing it I also have bought some skins in the game for my guns and most of them are pretty cool and I also have spent a lot to make my character look really cool and I think I did a good job but yeah my friends also buy cool items for their characters but I think mine looks the most pretty and handsome I recommend this game for having lots of fun also I bought this game when it wasn't free and I hope that the game stays as it has been because it keeps being fun also I forgot to say that I hit a 500m headshot with the Kar-98k on the asian map idk what its called im not trying to be racist but it was by the bridge and the person was on the other side of the bridge on the land and I was near the water I really like that map but I don't like the snow map that much and the jungle one is okay but only when we all are able to land at Bootcamp but my favorite is definitely Miramar because its a big map and there is cool landscapes and a bunch of other stuff there are also really cool cars arguably the best cars because they go really fast and I also found the super cool golden drug lord car in that cave that I literally had never heard about before but I think there might still be one in the mansion on the hill I forget what its called but regardless of that map I very much enjoy the Erangle map and i like dropping at the apartments near school because it's always very eventful and the map is just really fun I don't have much to say about it despite it being a really cool map and tied for my favorite but my friends favorite map is the small desert map that has the airstrikes that turn the map purple and it destroys houses I like it because there are no cars and its hard to get certain guns and it's much more fast paced but I like that for PVP so yeah to recap there are a lot of things I like about the game and not a lot of things I don't like about the game and now the game is free so there is no reason not to get the game because it's pretty damn good thanks for reading.

5990,"The way the characters in trailers and loading screens are portrayed reeks of cringe and does not fit the game. Ultimately the game is good and achieves what it intends to. Its just the other half; that is, the vibe of the game's community, is hollow and one update away from Fortnite dance levels of cringe.

Less cheaters than there once was. The Chinese players are now mostly fish in a barrel and there are fun weapon choices.

5999,"Sometimes you start to feel like this game had its peak way back in 2017-2018, but after playing it for a while you kinda get used to it. I would really choose this game all the time over Fortnite although the popularity and hype for this game has fallen a while ago. Would really recommend to play this game as your first Battle-Royale game if you're getting in to gaming and trying new things. I still remember playing it till 3 am at midnight with my friend yelling and he woke up his whole family. I will definitely miss the time, when this game was one of the most watched games on Twitch. But who knows, maybe someday more people will play it again. You should consider playing it, it feels amazing, gives you adrenaline rush and for me it also feels nostalgic."

6021,Maybe not the best engine but the feeling you get playing pubg is unmatched by any other battle royal. The one life feeling and working together with the boys to get that chicken dinner cant be funner.

6034,"This game saved my life.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

Update: decided to give it a second chance... it crashed during the drop from the airplane and then, when i tried to reconnect, it gave me ""corrupted data"" error and advised to check files... i just installed it before that match, mind you. No, fuck this game"

Hi
Yesterday I tried closing steam.exe while in a match, this crashed the game and closed it as well and I got banned from the game
I've read all the terms and rules and I believe I have not violated any of them
I did not have any cheating software on my PC or anything that alters the gameplay or bypasses its services, at the time or in the past
I did not violate any of the other terms as well

I would like to know why have I been banned, otherwise please unban my account
Thank you, have a nice day

Hello Survivor,

Thank you for contacting PUBG support.

It looks like you are writing about a restricted account.

We understand that this may be a very frustrating experience. However, please understand that a restriction is placed because we have determined that there was a violation of our terms and services, and is permanently restricted. Your account was banned on 2022-08-29 at 21:30:37 UTC and the process cannot be reversed.

Please note that even without having any programs specifically for “hacking/cheating” there are other programs or actions that can violate our Rules of Conduct and cause a permanent restriction.

- Software that bypasses the services in the game

- Programs that alter the game in any way (even if it is not for cheating)

- Cheats, macros, etc, for other games and not for PUBG is still a violation of the game’s services.

We're always available here to assist our players. Please let us know if you have any other feedback, questions, or comments. We will be happy to assist you in any way we can.

Hello again
Thank you for responding

I don't believe any of the software I had on violates PUBG's rules of conduct
What I had on is as it follows:
Kaspersky AV, Steam, Spotify, Task Manager, and Discord
None one of these programs bypasses the services in the game, alters the game in any way, or is cheats/macros

I believe PUBG's anticheat system thought closing PUBG by closing the steam client was a cheating attempt
If that's not the case, please let me know what exactly has caused the issue

***

Hello Survivor,

Thank you for writing to PUBG Support.

It looks like you are writing back about the restriction on your account.

As mentioned previously, there was an infraction detected in-game and the account has been restricted.

Violations of the terms and services do not just include cheating/hacking programs but also any programs that alter, bypass, or modify the game or its services in any way (even if it is used for non-cheating reasons).

We understand that this is an unfortunate situation and we apologize for the frustration, but there is nothing more we can do to assist with this restriction.

We ask for your understanding of the situation and we hope to provide a better gaming environment for all our players.

Hi Robert
Can you please check what was the infraction exactly? As in what was the software that has caused it or what was detected in-game?
I have no software that does what you've mentioned and I still believe my account restriction was unreasonable and a false-flag by PUBG's anticheat system

***

Hello Survivor,

Thank you for writing to PUBG Support.

You have updated us on the previous inquiry about the restriction.

We have already provided you with all the details that we can about the situation. The account has violated the terms and services and is permanently restricted.

We do not provide specific details on what triggered the violation due to security reasons. We do not provide any retests of restrictions since it is being done internally. We have no other information or details that we can provide to you about this situation.

Please refrain from sending multiple tickets on the same subject. If you continue to submit the same ticket continuously, we will have to categorize this as an abuse of our support system and cease any future assistance.

We understand that the situation is frustrating and we have assisted you as much as possible.

We ask for your understanding.

6062,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

6130,"Your'e new, you don't want to land near a crap ton of people because you still need to learn things. How to loot faster and map rotations. So don't be too frustrated that your first few games are either feeling slow or you die right away.
It's OK.
they also like to rotate maps every game so you have zero idea what map your going into until you're there! WHICH COULD BE THE EXACT SAME MAP!
FUN FUN, I only played the snow map like 5 times total.
The game, should, take note of that.
You play casual mode because you realize every game you play you are dying to level 500's not even trying.
Yet while playing casual mode where it's only 12 real players in the game, you still manage to be running from storm all game and you're up against sweaty level 500 players now trick shotting...
""wtf"" you say, ""how can i learn when the game doesn't want me to win?""
You stop playing, because it doesn't want you to win. ever.
95 fkn hours and still no win because I am constantly running out of storm with no cars in site EVER, to then have to cross a river, for it to all be meaningless because you just get bodied by a guy in a gully suit against a tree, now calling you all of the cuss words because you suck. The chances of the zone pulling to me should be just as likely but it never is. My games end edge of zone every game, complete opposite side of where i landed. No reason why I should give this game any more time out of my day."

6139,"This game could have been great! Yet, the issues that plague this game have been ignored for years making it a game with some great elements but completely ruined by an apathetic or incompetent management/dev team. First, the replay system reflects how things 'sorta' happened. It's so poor you can't tell if someone's cheating when you watch a ""replay"" as recoil and aiming as portrayed by the 'replay' system is a figment of what actually happened. This leads me to the second major issue for this game -- cheaters. This game is plagued with cheaters and thanks to the 'replay' system you get gaslit into questioning yourself whether the guy who got you was cheating or just legitimately that good. But, after playing the game enough you soon realize that the majority of level 500 players are cheating - using recoil and/or aim hacks. My personal opinion is that this issue has gone unaddressed for so long that if the management/dev team were to address it, it would have to ban more than half its players, thus undermining the number of players that actively play the game. Therefore, the management/devs do nothing to 'save face'.
I look forward to the day where this game is sold off and fixed, or dead -- replaced by a solid product that is A)responsive to legitimate community feedback and B)actively addresses cheating. The years that PUBG has existed with flaccid responses to both illustrate it has utterly failed at both.

Unfortunately in North America this game is almost completely unplayable from a competitive and somewhat even casual standpoint. The games NA audience is dead and the development team is doing nothing to fix it. You can sit in ranked queues for quite literally hours on end without finding a game. I think I sat in one for almost an hour and a half without finding a game before. In casual half of the lobby is bots. Don't waste your time getting into this game if you are in NA.

Unacceptable. Not only are there crashes but random ping spikes (lag basically) that will last entire matches is insane. This is the only online game I have issues with. Stability is absent.

6238,"The training said, ""complete this training to unlock all game modes"". I did, did not unlock ranked. Instead you need to play a bunch of casual I guess to unlock? This is also frustratingly unclear if you have no one to explain the game. You need to get to lvl 80 to play ranked, but it appears onlyCcasual levels that up. You are limited to 3 casual matches a day, not in your time zone but like the UTC... I understand this is to prevent hackers entering ranked, and am totally cool for it. But 1 don't lie, and 2 explain it... I'm wasting time playing ""random map"" game mode. So I guess I have to wait about 4 days at this rate to truly play all game modes, while needing to add tones of hours. 

That all being said, game play is fun, the first of its kind, but the game on the surface appears as an unprofessional MTX game if you ask me. Can't find my answers anywhere online. If someone actually knows and wouldn't mind shooting me a comment/message that'd be great actually. Is there a way besides Casual to level up survivor rank?"

6240,"Just recently revisited this game after not playing it for a couple of years and I have to say that this game's fall from grace is a sadder sight than I've seen in almost any other game.

To keep it as brief as possible, the devs have lost all touch with's community in terms of what's right for the game and what people actually want; clearly emphasised with it's mixed review state that I have no doubt will be permanent with the state it's in.

My personal quarrels with the changes made to this game over the years are things like the fact that you can no longer select what map you want to play in the main menu, the ranking system is useless if I'm in Bronze tier and I'm still getting matched against level 500 people who play like they are in Grandmaster tier, the silent / obvious cheaters that you can still encounter in matches (whether they are using a wallhack or aimbot, you'll just know by their snappy aim) and the bullshit hit-registration / damage localisation where someone wearing a Level 2 helmet can survive a SAIGA-12 shot to the head?

These are just a few of many problems I can see with the game in it's current state and to think that the developers can't seem to comprehend what's wrong and improve upon these things and instead give the strangest and arbitrary reasonings for them being implemented and changed to begin with. 

Don't waste your bandwidth and time on this game, it's truly not the game it once was and it's hardly worth it anymore."

6242,give me refund please?

and it ain't mine"
6244,"Great, I paid for the game and 1 month later it's free"
6245,"The most incompetent devs ever existed. 
game been around for 5 years and they still can't fix the damn issues, and everything they added to the game is either meh or no one picks up at all. 
The only thing that everyone talks about is the f***ing $3000 skins!
Can you imagine they roll back Sanok to its original version after like 5 updates to the map?
And worst of all, countless crashes, and today, the game black screened my PC and shut down my entire system. 
WTF is that???"

6254,good
6255,because of free to play
6256,"By far the worst BR I have ever played, even for a free game."
6257,"Gameplay is nice. The graphics could be more optimized, but they should run on a 5 year old graphics card. Currently there are some things behind a paywall like the ranked mode. Has a lot of skins that make you look like a clown and be more visible to enemies if you are into wasting money. It only supports Windows which feels like a slave master these days and the anti-cheat doesn't let it work with compatibility layers on other operating systems currently. I will still probably keep playing this because of the milsim-ish battle royale gameplay, but I think it's crap in many other ways."
6258,Microsoft powerpoint the game
6259,Good game but why naked?
6260,
6261,"Difficult game to master, but casual mode is fun, only issue is max rank players ruining casual mode (88 bots 12 players) and as it is now F2P there are banned hackers returning as noobs but play like pros with hacks. The game is still worth a download now as it's free."

6271,One of the best battle royals. If you love realistic type of games - PUBG is trying to be as realistic as it can.
6272,"This game is dead: hackers, lazy devs, bugs, bad patches, inconsistencies, team killers. Nothing from these developers for 5-6 years - they just live off this game. The honeymoon period for PUBG is over."
6273,shaka
6274,nice
6275,"best game ive ever played, from the moment I download it to the moment I uninstall this piece of dogshit set of code and graphics, probably the best videogame ever, besides skate 2. skate 2 is probably top tier when it comes to videogames, from the skating aspect to the open world creation that the beautiful developers made, skate 2 is just a masterpiece. Do me a favor and uninstall pubg and go install an emulator to run skate 2, best game ever, but this game is the best game ever by far."

6279,"A very good battle royale game but you got to like battle royales to enjoy it.
Not very beginner friendly because there are a lot of attachments and weapons.
The basic mechanics on the other hand are quite easy to master.

Due to the free to play patch i would say test it out by yourself, because the mixed reviews are not quite fair.

PS: Lots of Bots since the free to play update so winning your first rounds is quite easy"

6281,good

6283,"There's no point in trying to get good because you're just gonna get slapped by level 500 players, there is no skill-based matchmaking whatsoever. You are always at a disadvantage if you don't have any game sense past picking up a weapon. I'm level 50 with only a few wins under my belt because every encounter is some dude deleting me from across the desert with a M24 that i'd never see coming. Also, the death cam is trash and you'd never know if you died because the other player was cheating and snapped to you, or if the replay is lagging and he followed you the whole time. If you wanna try and get better aim on mouse and keyboard, just play CS:GO. At least the silvers are garbage and the P90 is a noob's dream. If you want a battle royale, play Warzone where you're guaranteed people are cheating but it's still Call of Duty. And if you want something realistic, go join the army -- at least you don't get head-glitched by the Taliban."

6287,"Such an intense game, LOVE it!"
6288,Anybody know where i can get a carburetor for my STIHL weed wacker. I also could use a wheel for my cub cadet. She blew up when i was in a lawn mower race with my cousin jimmy. By the way this game is fun.
6289,"I am a 44 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 20 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. We played all night after I got home from my 9-5 day job. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
6290,this gam is like really bad and I dont like the walking for 3 hours part
6291,THIS STUPID FUCKING BLUEHOLE GAME IS MAKING ME PLAY A TUTORIAL AND AGAINST BOTS WHEN I PLAYED THIS GAME WHEN IT WAS IN BETA AND ITS STILL IN BETA. WHAT A JOKE I WANT MY 80 HOURS BACK THIS GAME SUCKS DONT PLAY IT
6292,Last time I played this game was back in 2017. Downloaded it again and honestly most fun I ever had on it. Games is made so much better than what it used to be and I recommend getting it. And now the game is free a lot of my friends got it and we all played and enjoyed playing as a squad. Game is so much better than what it was in 2017.

As a special reward to loyal players of many years, we get to complete basic training and 10 training matches. Except the servers are always busy (even for an AI match!) and I keep getting disconnected.

I paid for this game years ago and don't mind that it's now free.

I do mind that I can't play a game a paid for and that I had to agree to a new ""privacy policy"" to play it. One which includes the ability for your data to be sold.

I don't have time to be waiting for these guys to sort their servers out, or force me to go through a load of entry level play.

Uninstalling this. Such a shame.

6361,Worst game i've ever played. Very Laggy and unoptimized. I'm very glad that i didn't buy this game when it was paid. PUBG Mobile way much better than this.  Even the developer doesn't care about this game.
6362,"Why exactly am I limited to 3 casual games per day..? And achievements don't proc from Deathmatch..? Or Why doesn't the zombie mode exist on PC..? (Game mode exists now, but mobile version was much better. PC Zombie didn't make much sense..)

Why is there no system of matching players per ability..? Nobody plays ranked.
THAT is the major issue - There is nothing that I'm aware of that separates gaming pros from casual players, so I can't even play casual games w/out getting GANKED by level 500 players.

Press F to stop using bandages and get EJECTED from moving vehicle, killing you instantly. Nice work, Devs.

Devs focus on cashgrab B\/LL$H1T and not balance or fun for casual players. F \/ C K THIS GAME."

Look when it comes time to give up this game, like what I just recently did, please make sure you go out on a good fun final chicken dinner winning game. Don't make your last memory of PUBG sour as you will think of all the time wasted and all the negative thoughts. If you finish happy you won't feel like you've wasted your life - and that is a good thing. It is time to move one, so get going! There is a steam sale on right now and bargains a plenty!

Constantly lagging since about 5 updates back. still can't fix it. The game has always had problems with just randomly quitting in the middle of a game. Not to mention all of the people that are cheating. I tried playing the game off and on for years but only last a few games before all the cheating and glitches make it not fun. I really hoped they would fix it but after so long I doubt it. what a waste of time.

6504,"best game sometimes, absolute worst game other times.
it would help if it works everytime"
6505,"A fairly fun shooter, especially if you play with friends. 
The game has gotten quite stale over the years and I am a bit amazed that so little has been added to it, when it has so many years on its back. The arsenal is fairly small and the amount of playable maps is outright pathetic. 
It is one of those games that has so much potential, but seems to take the lazy route and just rely on the people, who enjoy it for what it is, not expecting much from it. 
And it is fine for what it is. But I can't give it a strong recommendation, just a decent one."

6517,Very realistic bro
6518,"I'm absolutely pissed right now.

I've played this ""masterpiece""  for over 500 hours so can tell my negative review. In early days of this game it was actually better then now. There wasn't as many cheaters as now and it was playable, but since the game went free it was like a C4 bomb exploding. Every second game I'm killed to a blatant cheater, who can't accept that fact that he's so bad in the game that he needs to use third party programs to even get to last 5 man standing. 

And for the better experience this wannabe good developers decides to add new anti-cheat that is more disgusting than the previous one. For the matter of fact I cannot even play this game anymore. Some error occurs with the new anti-cheat and I've tried so many ways to repair it but with no success and now I'm SO MAD RIGHT NOW thinking I've paid 30$ then. I want to puke. 

This game is slowly dying and we all know that. If not for the Asian community this game would be buried next to its horrible anti-cheat.

Right now I'm only missing my 30$ I should have bought kebab than this."

I always defended it from the hate, but no more.
The developers of this game should be fired, every single one of them.
I'm sorry but you can't fix issues that are still there since day 1, but you can add useless skins to profit more.

Now today PUBG restarting crashing, eating all my ram with its very common memory leaks.
Perhaps a horrible implementation of one of the countless ""anticheat"" that they tried to use so far?

I just hope that this game dies or that a proper replacement comes from skilled developers."

We played a few casual mode games and the nostalgia came flooding back. Solid gun play, great pacing to the fights, really caught my interest again.

So we qued up for our first true PvP match and were killed by a hacker within 10 minutes. Guy with numbers as his name domed us through trees after snapping to each of our heads. Immediately killed any interest I had of playing further."

Nah, not raw dumbie, she'd blend it first, then put it in a pizza oven until it got all crumble like, then she would snort it right off the hot ass pan, like she gave no motha fuckin fucks. It was some Hardcore shit, just like my gameplay. Doesn't matter, 3rd person or first, I quench thirst like an overpriced lemonade stand that holds out on the sugar. I beast like a couple grams of weed in Michael Phelps nap sack at the Olympics. Like Oprah at a car dealership. Like Jeff Bezo the day after Amazon Prime Day. Like a slim jim in your back pocket. I hit hard like a chancla thrown at the wall that bounced back off and slap you in the face with some motha fuckin wisdom.

6671,"Bugs, glitches, constant crashes, I can tolerate to a degree. Even though, with each update, the game becomes more glitchy and more unstable, each bug fix creates more problems and so on. I really don't understand what's the point of the trashy skins which make women characters look like cheap prostitutes, but whatever. 
Anyways, the game is a hackfest, since it was made free. Almost every unranked game is ruined by cheaters. I've submitted countless reports, even screen recordings, ""best"" case scenario, is a 24 hour temp ban. Ranked matches, are a whole different cup of tea. The insanity of the hacks, the level of cheating is atrocious. Unplayable. I'm pretty sure that whoever is behind this game, stopped caring and they even endorse hacking. They do nothing. In the current state, the game is unplayable, unless you want to wrack your nerves and feel disgust. Shame on everyone, behind this s**t show!

Matchmaking system is awful. I often queue squads and more often then not only get a duo. Sometimes no teammate at all.

Most matches are still filled with bots which are completely braindead.

The real players you do run into are level 500 gigachads that dont wear deodorant and you get melted instantly. Really really really do not recommenend you play this game. Oh did i mention the cheaters? 

Will not be playing this game ever again."
6706,I played for a few days and had a good time with friends but I got banned for no reason what so ever. I have never cheated in a video game ever I think cheating is pointless and makes the gaming experience not for for everyone involved. I paid full price played for about 2 weeks with no issues to then get banned because the anti cheat didn't launch properly after I had been disconnected mid game. I rejoin to then get banned and support did nothing for me. My record and headshot % will back this up I only had like 10 chicken dinners with countless of loses so safe to this game was not worth it. I hate having vac ban on my steam account for no reason.

6740,"The Best Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies
Ingredients
for 12 cookies

½ cup granulated sugar(100 g)
¾ cup brown sugar(165 g), packed
1 teaspoon salt
½ cup unsalted butter(115 g), melted
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour(155 g)
½ teaspoon baking soda
4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks(110 g)
4 oz dark chocolate chunk(110 g), or your preference
Preparation
1.In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
2.Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
3.Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).
4.Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.
5.Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
6.Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.
7.Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.
8.Cool completely before serving.
Enjoy!"

6745,"ITS A TRAP
its not free at all. I gotta admit you can play the regular match but the ranked mode (which is like the most important thing in the game) requires you to purchase the plus membership which totally still counts as paying so why did you make it free in the first place?"

6747,all battle royale games are bad
6748,"run across a field until u get shooted from nowhere the simulator, nice game"
6749,"Even with good mechanics and realistic gun-play, it feels rather frustrating shooting and not being able to control the recoil, it's too much. Enemies are hard to spot and you waste a lot of time looting and dies for someone hiding or go to a crowded place and can't find a good weapon, dying anyway. I really tried but it wasn't fun anymore, sadly. I had so much more fun on PUBG Lite and mobile, but this game is not friendly to new and casual players."

-Server problems no stability
-No new content unless its purchasable (skins, clothes, crates .etc)
-PUBG Lite was the Greatest thing they ever did and canceled it just to go FREE and never bothered fixing their first game 
-Updates to fix problems EVERY week (light game, no hackers, simple and PERFECT just the way all games should be)
-No refunds for players that bought the game (except skins, cosmetics)
-UNPLAYABLE even though you got the PC requirements (half recommended requirements on PC playing at FULL LOW graphics, 30-35 fps at best

6883,Sheeesh
6884,best game to enjoy with freinds and blame them!! xdxd
6885,:D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D
6886,I change my review i won several games and have played over 60 hours and a new stupid update forces me to go through a 1 hour training mode just to play normal mode screw this game!
6887,"have to do a shitty stupid tutorial after 120 fucking hours, fuck these retarded chinese sellouts"
6888,All it takes in this game is a hack software and enough skins and in game purchases to not get banned give it a try. ohhh yeah dont forget to thank in game transactions to allow you to cheat and suck them off extra hard while doing so they love it. btw hackers will knock you and the non cheaters will finish you so they cant be reported.
6889,This game is a must have for first person shooters
6890,This game makes my dad goes to buy milk.

6906,just like bad game overall. better graphics card wins
6907,"game is garbage. no servers, ping is 90+, lose every cqc gunfight because bullets dont reg. either hack or refund."
6908,"What is there left to say about pubg? I have sunk so many hours into this game and I'm still rubbish at it you will get headshot out of nowhere, question people's ability and generally get very annoyed with everything. It's better optimised now than it was five years ago and there's more maps than just enragel but I'm still pleased to get back on that map as so many funny moments and good memories."

6917,"795.4 hrs on record , i think pub has had some serious potential back in 2015. today i think the developers just care about the skins more then the game. with the new map release coming and next gen updates delayed for over 2 1/2 years , idk what they plan on doing. some aspects of the game are still fun, but don't expect to jump right in and have a great time as a newer player."
6918,the game has a constant issue with crashing. Happens much too frequently and happens regardless of PC and player. Never gets fixed. Exceptionally disappointing.

6931,Game has been dying slowly due to focus on overly expensive skins and beyond confusing skin/blueprint/multiple currency pathways. They had a gem and drove it straight into the ground with greed. Now too many games out there do this genre way better and PUBG will continue to die. Sad part is the people in charge will probably wonder why it died and never know how much it was their fault.

6944,"not sure why i'm hooked.  probably because all RPG's are exactly the same but you have to learn new moves.  its redundant to play all new adventure games, more to of the same.  stupid story, button mashing, big boss, lame ending.   PUBG is none of these.  PUBG is exactly the same but in a good way, a familiar way.  Each round is a whole new adventure game, a new story.  Anything can happen and it never ends the same way twice.  Its a dated game that should be dead, but the graphics are still as good any, the controls are great and simple.  Literally the only issue is people not being grouped by skill level, and its a monster issue."

6955,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

6980,"Played it for 25hrs and i can say its good game,but its not for my taste(im not competition gamer by any stretch of a imagination).Community is ok,love many weapons that this game has and i respect the fact that this game has good graphics(at least for time when it got released);its great that microtransactions in this game are at minimum(you can buy everything with 2 currencies,but if you don`t want to wait you can use real money),also very important:it works good even on PC/laptop that isn`t suitable for it(i have new laptop with Ryzen 5 5500u,integrated graphic and 24gb ram,it works fine even on medium-high options).What i don`t like is how game (sometimes) gets a bit buggy(acts wierd) to certain mouse and keyboard configurations(i have white shark marcus 2 mouse and it gets imposible to play the game when i set mouse to higher DPI), i also don`t like how main menu is set up(its all over the place and bit confusing).So basicaly: if you have what it takes to play against guys that play this game 12hrs every day for 2yrs even if you don`t have such a hardware;just hoop in and get that chicken dinner."

So why don't I recommend the game.

In it's current state this game is as stable as dog shit.  Having a good game?  Having a bad game?  PUBG don't care it will randomly crash without any warning.  Nothing is more frustrating than being in the final endgame and having the whole game freeze on you before it then reboots your PC.

Check drivers they say, check file integrity, re-install that game.  Done all this, it makes no difference.  

So then the finger is pointed at my system ""you've got a dodgy graphics card mate"" is what they say.  Well if that's the case why is this the only game I have that behaves like this?  Why are lots of gamers reporting the same problem?  Why are high profile streamers complaining of the same issue?

In short, the game is good.  The code is pure dog shit."

7186,the game crashes too many and loading screen freeze every 1 out of 3 matches which is aweful I can tell that  it need alot of work to compeite with other compititors game's companies
7187,Honestly if it wasn't for the good gunplay this game wouldn't be played today. They force you to play terrible maps and give the best maps (the ones most people want to play) a lower percentage rate. They are constantly updating the game with their terrible over-the-top skins and catering to their chinese overlords. If you haven't played this game from the start the novelty wears off pretty fast. It's only fun when playing with friends and I wouldn't personally recommend this game to anyone. Terrible graphics too.

I know PUBG was a buggy mess for a long time but seriously this game is amazing now. I play from Australia VPN'd to Singapores servers and at sub 100 ping its an amazing experience and the game is very much alive in Asia.

I've been playing this game since 2018 and have 1300+ hours on this account and 1000+ on my laptops account."

7287,"Pretty fun, pretty frustrating."
7288,"I love this game, but I can't recommend it to those who want to play it for the first time.

 The game lacks the correct selection of players, both in regular matches and in ranked ones.  For example, you are level 50-100, do you think you will be matched with players of the same level as you, or a maximum of 200-250?  Hah, no!  In most matches, you will come across players of the maximum level who gave their lives to this game!  The only thing you can do in this case is to jump to where there are no players and then hide from everyone all the time, and eventually reach the top 20-30 and die from level 500.  Very fun and interesting right?  And even more interesting is that you will not be able to choose which map to play on, 7 out of 10 fights you will play on Miramar, where there are only open fields, and one fine moment, when you once again run across the open field, you will be killed and you  You don't even know where!
 But instead of changing the matchmaking system, the developers would rather add another new map on which you can never play.  Or even better, they will add new skins, you really need them, right?

 For developers, how to fix the game:
 1 - if you can't make a selection according to the skill of the players, then at least make sure that a level 100 player plays a maximum against a level 200, a level 200 player plays a maximum against a 300. I think this is not difficult to do.
 2 - Give me a choice on which map to play!  I am ready to choose a PARAMO card and wait 3-4 minutes for the players to gather.  I DON'T WANT MIRAMAR, I DON'T WANT!!!  Or you could do this, don't give me a direct map selection, but when the game is ready to load me into combat, ask me ""do I want to play the map...MIRAMAR!""  If I press NO, then the game continues to match players, but on any other map.

I will gladly change my comment after the developers somehow change these two points."

Like if you are new, you can try it out, its not that bad battleground game, but for those who are playing since the beginning, we can all agree about that, this is going downhill. Pay to win skins, map rotations are horrable, 25gb updates for .. 3 new skins and a map which was there before but now we removed it and added back so you have to download it again.
Map bugs are insane, especialy on miramar, where you can almost die in a non exitsing map texture.

7350,"okrykmr its GREATTT

7351,"This game is very frustrating at times. But the high lethality of the weapons make this a very exciting and compelling experience. Knowing you can kill someone instantly or be killed instantly is not only thrilling, but makes every kill you get feel that much better. This will not be everyone's favorite Battle Royale but for me it is my top one because no other gun has the power that these do."

7521,"INFESTED WITH CHEATERS!!!   Unless you like dying to AIMBOTS, Wall Hacks ""EVERY... SINGLE"" match.  DO NOT install this game.  Level 500 max level players running around with Cheat Engine snapping on targets instantly.  And reporting them does NOTHING.  No matter how bad they are cheating the report is only a 24 hour ban.  How do you think a player can make it to level 500 in this game cheating every single match?  Because the developer doesn't care about perma-banning cheaters.  They are making money from cheaters, all true players have moved on to other games.  Beware of cheaters, I repeat beware of cheaters every single match."

7530,"it was free and i still feel i overpaid.  
its impossible to use a controller.  to be clear, you ""can"" use a controller.  but the B button switches you between controller operation, and keyboard operation.  this means every time you crouch, you switch between the controller methods.  when a controller is present, the keyboard wont work, even if its in control.  the only fix is to quit the game and start over.  i cant even get past the tutorial.

you already ruined the mobile game... fix the pc verison!"
7531,sweaty losers ruined this game
7532,no
7533,It is a very fun game 100% recommended
7534,"Game has been dying slowly due to focus on overly expensive skins and beyond confusing skin/blueprint/multiple currency pathways. Hackers. Every game more than 5 squads per match are hackers. Before I played PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS i had a small wee wee, no girlfriend no friends and absolutely no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
7535,"I have always had a soft spot for PUBG, starting from the days i played it on PS.. but since those days I bought a new PC and re-purchased the game. Unfortunately (even with the love I have for the game) my patience is wearing super thin with the amount of wall hack, aimbot, radar licking scum bags that decide to call the PUBG servers home. PLEASE do something about this ASAP, I stopped playing last year as I was sick of the hacking, I come back FOUR SEASONS later and its still full of 13 year old sweats.. will this ever change? probably not.. hence the loss in numbers over the last few years. Maybe the end will be coming sooner then we think for PUBG

from three and a half million players to less then 500k in the space of 4 years, and I Imagine thats mainly from people being sick of hackers"
7536,"The game was iffy when they released it but still fun. After after a few years of hiatus I decided to pick it back up again. The unskippable tutorial is horrendous, as is the spyware required (see, anticheat) to run the game. 

Again, unskippable tutorial is horrendous. Would not recomend, play fornite zero build instead"
7537,Recently there is a lot of cheater also who is the PUBG creator they aware about cheating but they let them to use because they knew who is using the cheat if they got the ban from the game they'll gonna buy one more time game so they make money but they don't think real players left the game !!
7538,"The game interface has had a lot of problems from ten years ago and so far they have not been fixed. I cannot access the servers because they are hidden. I have to restart the game and sometimes more than once in order to be able to enter the game

7602,"Kui otsite selle mängu kohta arvustust, olete sattunud valesse kohta, aga kui otsite silmapaistvat pirukaretsepti, olete jõudnud õigesse kohta.

Koostis:

1. 6 spl soolata võid
2. 1/2 tassi valget suhkrut
3. 1/2 tassi pruuni suhkrut
4. 1/4 tassi vett
5. 1/4 tl kaneeli
6. 1 näputäis soola
7. 5 õuna – kooritud, südamik ja viilutatud
8. 1 küpsetis kahekordse koorega piruka jaoks

Juhised:

1. Kuumuta ahi temperatuurini 425 kraadi F (220 kraadi C).
2. Sega või, valge suhkur, pruun suhkur, vesi, kaneel ja sool kastrulis keskmisel kuumusel. Kuumuta keemiseni, tõsta tulelt ja tõsta kõrvale.
3. Rulli pool tainast lahti, et see mahuks 9-tollise pirukaplaadiga. Asetage alumine koorik pirukaplaadile; vala sisse õunaviilud.
4. Rulli pealmine koor 10-tolliseks ringiks. Lõika terava koorimisnoa või kondiitrikettaga 8 (1-tolliseks) laiaks ribaks. Koo kondiitriribad ükshaaval võremustriks. Voldi võre ribade otsad põhjakooriku serva alla ja suru tihendamiseks kokku.
5. Valage või-suhkru segu piruka peale, kattes võre ja laske ülejäänud kastmel läbi kooriku niriseda.
6. Küpseta eelkuumutatud ahjus 15 minutit. Vähendage kuumust 350 kraadini F (175 kraadi C) ja küpsetage veel 35–40 minutit, kuni koorik on kuldpruun, pealmise kooriku karamell on hangunud ja õunatäidis mullitab. Enne viilutamist lase täielikult jahtuda."

The development team are absolutely useless.
Back in 2017 there were millions of players playing concurrently.... look at the state of the game now and its all due to poor management and development team.
They don't deserve the hundreds of millions they have made from this game."

7667,"To the point: There are plenty of bad games in the world. I've played a lot of them, this is easily top 3 worst of them all. At 95 hours the amount of times that a person can be aim-botted in this absolutely godawful piece of garbage is astonishing. It's unbelievable that people pay money to play this turd. For a combat based game, the actual combat itself is egregious. Buggy game play, choppy frame rates, clunky overall feeling, awkward handling and frustratingly inaccurate combat are a few descriptive terms that still don't adequately convey how terrible this game truly is. Out of 100 ""people"", 30 of them are robots and of the 70 remaining, probably 10 of those use aimbots or other exploits. The most entertaining part is looting and that's disappointing half the time. To sum it up you sit in a lobby for a few minutes each round, you dive out of a plane and hope nobody lands close to you because while you're looking for a weapon they're somehow fully geared. They kill and send you back to the lobby. This game should be called ""Lobby Simulator"" Or ""Lets Get Aimbotted"". I can't even begin to attempt to detail all of the negative experiences in this game. Dedicating one more second playing this absolutely miserable, embarrassment of a joke of a game is beyond absurd. In 95 hours, estimate around 2-4 matches an hour, and estimate that 3/4ths of those were terrible, and you have this abomination; PUBG."

Perhaps better!"
7745,"Man this game just does not really hold up that well anymore!... movement feels clunky and slow, the game is basically just a boring walking simulator waiting for things to happen, only to get killed by a minuscule pixel hiding behind one of the million trees in your field of view (or not even in it!! usually from behind!!). A lot of the gun mechanics just feel clunky too, and maybe that's because I don't know how to use them right, but CS:GO is a game with complex gun mechanics and it still manages to make it somewhat fluid and predictable. I haven't played the game a lot since I bought it 2018 on an old account, but I hear that the Chinese hacker problem is STILL going on, according to reviews? Really sucks tbh. This game was the first of its kind, spawning the battle royale genre as we know it for the most part, but ironically this one was the worst of them all. Fortnite and Apex executed it so much better, they are way more fun. Even as a F2P game now, I would still not recommend anyone waste your precious time on this game"
7746,"i paid 30$ for this in 2019.
lots of cheaters now!"

7753,"How the mighty have fallen. I really enjoyed this one, but it's almost unplayable now. Battle Royale is a cool genre of shooter that I like, but PUBG has been out done by so many other, newer titles. It's shocking how a game that's only five years old feels so dated."

7759,"After playing this game off and on for at least 4 years, I can't just hop into a match. Normal gameplay is locked behind a tutorial. I can't help but feel a game I paid for was taken from me, or at least, made harder to play."
7760,noice game

7786,ZULUL
7787,"VERY addicting to play, I love the lifelike shooting no other game has shooting like this. I definitely recommend this game if you're into first person shooter games or if you like playing in teams!"
7788,bad game. Highly recommend staying away. Bad game. Lots of poorly made physics and models. Guns are lame. Bad game. Did the HK416 wrong by renaming it. Bad game. poor design of buildings and poor choice of weaponry. Bad game. Strange and unbalanced system of gear and looting as well as unnecessary additions to the game which make it overly complicated. super bad game.
7789,"It feels more and more everyday like its being focused to be a mobile game with the battles pass and skins you see on mobile games.
Older PUBG will never be compared to this, yes it was buggier and there were more cheaters but it felt more raw and fun to play, now it feels like im playing a mobile game with half the lobby being bots and the other half level 500s, no in between.
Its still fun to play from time to time i guess."

7799,nice

7832,"A very very good game...challenging, yet relaxing and fun....I play with the Steam Controller (mapped to keyboard/mouse)...works well...10/10"
7833,"This game is just trash. I can't even start 1 round without a game crash. And if you think I just have a too bad pc, than I have to disappoint you. The pc (Nvidia Geforce RTX 3060, 16gb RAM, i7 core 12th gen) where I'm writhing this review is way better than my old one. On my old one I could at least start a round. It still crashed during the rounds but I could at least join again. I already tried to delete the game and reinstall it, but it still doesn't work."
7834,"The game has changed form over the years since pre-release; some changes for the better, some for the worst but it's all a matter of opinion. I have definitely had my moneys worth though and will continue to enjoy playing for quite some time."
7835,Interesting gameplay and no cheaters in 47 hours of play
7836,its pretty good i think

7838,yeah man
7839,no me gusta el juego es demasiado aterrador es cuando te quedas quieto un momento tras 3 minutos hay un mensaje oculto y un Easter Egg que he encontrado 3 minutos después sonic se rinde del juego y se suicida al caer al vacío como si nada y el Game Over tiene música de fondo como la de sonic. Exe 🚨alerta no la instalen🚨pero si cambias la música cuando peleas con Robotnik o Eggman y una música horripilante y si introduces el Código particular sale sonics con cara de hackers 🚨no la instalen 🚨

7855,"wow.... thats all i can say about this gorgeous piece of word. This game is p e r f e c t i o n, i dont even know what to say. This game has it all, shooting, killing, awesome epic voice (everyone is super friendly), the game just feels so smooth after the new game engine patch, the looting mechanics are beyond any current game, and theres nothing better then eating that delicious chicken dinner after a good all PUBG win. Please buy this game it has no bugs, never crashes and is a god sent game."
7856,Best horror game i've ever played. Very loud!
7857,too many no-lifes and hackers

7859,"Great Battle Royal game,realistic,fantastic,crazy!"
7860,"I am a honest player who like you game in the first time, I only played it for several hours(most time in the game loading), because I don't have a good computer at that time, there are many bugs when I played and I could'n even start a game match for many times, so I didn't play it any more.

But recently, I fount that I've be VAC banned for no reason three years ago(I don't know that until know, and I don't know why, MAY BE BECAUSE I WAS AN ASIAN PLAYER?), and later it changed to game ban, not VAC ban. The no-reason ban affect my another game called squad, I can't join some service because I 'v been banned by you game for no reason, and other player and my friends had seen my detail and an VAC or in game ban, it caused a GREAT effect to me!!!

I paid for this game for ¥ 98.00, and the game gave me this, I want the ban be canceled and my money back. I'll change this comment after that."

7869,"This game is like a toxic relationship. You love it, but it drives you absolutely insane at times, and requires you to take a break every now and again."
7870,<3
7871,Fun game with friends.
7872,"The concept is sick but the gameplay and movement is ass.

Could have been a sick game but movement is dogshid"
7873,hehe
7874,Play it!
7875,"Like many multiplayer games that have been out there for a few years, it's plagued with cheaters (who often only get 1 day bans [i][b]if[/b][/i] they get caught) and max level players who play this game so much, they look like cheaters, which is a huge problem because matchmaking is basically nonexistent, so you'll often be paired against those two, even if you play casual mode (which you can only play 3 times a day btw). 

That brings it to the other problem that is, the devs made this game free in order to attract new players, but did very little to make sure they have a decent experience, so that they stick around. Instead, they focus on dumping even more expensive gun skins and goofy outfits into the game to milk their ever decreasing playerbase.

Other issues include:

- no ability to choose which map you wanna play on, they're always randomly picked save for casual mode which is always on Erangel (the classic, first map);
 
- poor weapon balancing leading to players mostly only ever using the ""meta"" weapons; 

- exploitable game mechanics that give experienced players an unfair edge such as spamming leaning and crouching to avoid headshots; 

- terrible sound mixing (gunshots are too loud while footsteps are too low in comparison); 

- lack of different modes for ranked matches, you can only pick between 4-man-squad and solo-vs-squads both on first person view mode only (this is made worse by the fact ranked matches are locked behind a paywall);

- inconsistent damage model that favours headshots too much;

Don't be like me and waste your time trying to learn this game and be good at it, it's not gonna happen and it's frankly not worth it. It's only sometimes fun if you're playing this with friends on casual mode (12 players,  the rest are bots) and happen to be lucky enough to get a decent match without having to deal with too many max level try-hards / cheaters, otherwise you're better off playing something else unless you have no self-love. This might have been the best BR game at one point, but it's clear its days of glory are long gone and it's not looking like it's making a comeback."

That being said, my friends and i playing it ALL the time.

play smart, drop light and spends 25 minutes getting geared up to get killed after you find a good spot. or drop hot and get killed instantly. the choice is yours but dont worry, cause you can do it all over again the match."

Pros :
Very addictive, 
Great time pass,
Gives a great joy (sometimes)

Cons :
You need a good pc to play it,
Can affect mental health,
You can get severe anger, frustration and depression :>"

Fuck PUBG."
7965,you can take your clothes of and tbag dead bodies
7966,"You are still not able to choose a map after such a long time... 
Lobbys which are filled with bots and most of the time you have to play those shitty maps against more than 50% Bots because nobody wants to play in a endless desert called Miramar.

Could be such a nice game, but the devs are unfortunately completely off track and they give a f*ck on the community."

7979,"Grand master OG Battle Royal. A bit of a learning curve for both console and pc, but is totally worth cranking a few hours each week to become decent. In PUBG, you have to be smart. Patience is virtue and you have to stay moving. You could get shot from anywhere and if you wanna make it in the ranked division you're gonna have to own your skills such as gun control and circle control. Close quarters combat is awesome and with a Team death match mode, you are able to really practice becoming the best. Should you give it a go, 100% yes. Will you like the feeling of winning gun fights? I believe so. Can you dress up like a dinosaur? YOU KNOW IT!"

7996,"This game is genuinely one of the worst games I have ever played. Almost every aspect about this game is frustrating or flat out unnecessary. As a fair beginner to pubg, these issues are glaring and puts me off from playing.
First off, the beginner experience is terrible. Upon starting, you cannot even begin to play PvP until you complete 10 rounds of PvE, which is a whole another chore to grind through. After completing the snooze fest that is the AI matches, you can choose to play with real people. That seems like a relief, you might think, until you realize every single match you are put in consists of bots and lvl 500 sweaty tryhards. The barrier of entry into this game is horrendous because of this nonsensical matchmaking system. Hell, not even alternative gamemodes are spared from this. I tried finding some enjoyment out of the deathmatch gamemode, but its all the same. The same lvl500s plague this side of the game as well. Before you attack me and tell me to ""get good"", realize that in every successful game, newer players are catered to a beginner experience to help them ease into the game. Its just part of good game design. However, the pubg devs could care less and it shows.
Secondly, the gameplay. There is no other word to describe the gameplay in pubg other than infuriating. The first issue is the map size. The map is just too big. Anyone who plays pubg can agree with this to an extent, even if you are a recurring player. For 100 players, maps this expansive means that half the gameplay involves walking. You do nothing half the game because there IS nothing to do. This game is basically walking/driving simulator because you cannot even find someone to fight. Also, the fights are just confusing. The game color palette is dark and grimy and this wouldnt be a problem if other players also have the same colors for clothes. This makes finding anyone on the map feel like finding a needle in a haystack. If you squint really closely and look, you might find something moving. But it will turn out to be a piece of paper in the wind. To add on, gunfights share the same problem. If you get shot at in this game, good luck trying to find out where the shooter is. There is no bullet lines or damage indicators telling you where you get shot from. There is not even a minimap that shows you the potential locations of players. Basically, this game boils down to whoever shoots first, wins. This is one of the main reasons I choose to quit this game. If the devs cannot provide players with even the slightest QoL changes, it is sign of a bad game. Another gripe I have is the amount of unnecessary and complicated buttons during gameplay. Its almost as if the devs were making combat complicated for the sake of making it complicated. If you dont believe me, there is a hotkey to hold your breath. Yes, hold your breath when shooting to make gunfire steadier. Its these little things that makes the game much more cluttered than it should be.
Lastly, the cosmetics. Why is half of the game's cosmetics so goofy looking? On one hand, the game is gritty and realistic, with combat simulating real life gunfights. On the other hand, there are dudes in dinosaur onesies running around the battlefeild. If the devs are so deadset on making the game as realistic as possible with all the nuainces such as breathholding, why is there such goofy skins in the same game. It sticks out like a sore thumb and clashes with the game's atmosphere. It is almost as if the devs looked at fortnite and how popular it has become and tried taking a leaf out of their book. It just does not fit in.
So basically, yes , the game is bad and the devs could care less. In fact, I bet they made the game free to play after its playerbase began declining. And I can see why. If you are a new player getting into this game, do yourself a favor and dont. Im not kidding when I say fortnite is a miles better game. If you want a fun battle royale game thats forgiving to beginners, choose anything else other than pubg. Fortnite, warzone, even minecraft hunger games. I am truly disappointed in this game."

8029,"You better have a squad ready to go if you play this game a lot, cause it amounts to nothing more than discord with gameplay . Only there's lots of other games that provide roughly the same thing but are actually:

- Engaging
- Don't look like garbage
- Aren't riddled with cheaters and bots 
- The physics don't feel as if you're walking on the moon 

If your PC can handle this then you're much better off playing basically any other multiplayer FPS out there. This game has nothing going for it. Nothing. It feels like an AI Generated UE4 project. It [i] looks [/i] like an AI Generated UE4 project. It's a nothing game. The blandest most uninteresting gameplay loop you can imagine. Get loot, drive to town, kill 5 bots, get sniped by hacker, repeat.

There's solace in that. You don't have to take anything seriously, so you can shoot your friends cause they said something in the discord call that pissed you off (may or may not be based on true events). And you have ample time to f*ck around and do dumb stuff because the games take [i] abysmally [/i] long to get going, but at that point you're just creating your own fun instead of having fun with the game.

Wanna play it anyway? Fine, get a friend group and just get drunk, just remember that you could be getting drunk and playing Garry's Mod instead or some other party game which would have the added bonus of not being PUBG

If you're solo and want to play this then may God have mercy on your soul, seriously.

8163,"It pains me to say that I'm no longer a fan of this game. I used to love playing PUBG with friends on the Xbox One, and decided to give it another go on the PC. It did not go well.

The game has made little-to-no improvements since I played long ago, and what they have implemented haven't been done well. Too many currency systems, controls still seem a bit clunky, and I hear my computer rev up while it attempts to load the map. I have a good PC, and no other game does this.

The addition of a Deathmatch mode was a nice touch, but it didn't do enough to make me want to play again. If you're going to PUBG for Deathmatch though, you're far better off going with Call Of Duty or something like that.

As for the Battle Royale aspect, it's falling short when compared to all the other games out there. Apex and Fortnite seem to be eclipsing PUBG in almost every aspect, as well as consistently adding new things to keep it interesting (and upgrading the things they're doing well already).

Also, instead of using a good anti-cheat software, they decided to go with Wellbia and it's terrible. It installs into your system and will run after you shut down the game, and doesn't uninstall after uninstalling the game (you need to manually do it). It's garbage, and they should be ashamed of themselves.

I would hate to say that it's not worth a try, but it just needs a lot of work before getting a recommendation from me."

When you try and shoot the people in gliders, nothing but no regs, but when they shoot you oh man youre in for some fun. been how many years but the movement still feels like im walking in quicksand? still cant walk through doorways properly without feeling like a pinball stuck in a hellish game of pinball. Ever since it went free its worse, and its sad cuz i paid money for this game lol. If i could still refund this dog shit, i would. But since going free, they have no taken away getting your money back.

8295,"I'm glad i didn't pay any money for this game. The gameplay is really nice, and the guns are pretty fun to use. Graphics wise, it isn't as good as some games released around it, but that doesn't really concern me. *However,* the number of level 500 players makes it completely unfair. It's not their fault, but since there is no free matchmaking, I get pummeled most every game.

When paired with players of my own skill level, it's an amazing game. I can usually get a steady streak... until I run into a level 500 (or even level 150). Then, well.. you can guess what happens to my poor level 32 character. It's disappointing that PUBG has failed to implement a level-based match making system in the normal mode.

All in all, the game is fun to play, but the number of experienced players is completely discouraging. I will continue to play PUBG simply because I like its gameplay and weapons system enough to deal with being pummeled in the late game."
8296,"This game is basic utter sh*te , it basically banned me due to hacking and cheating mid game even though I didn't cheat or hack the game !!!! this is ridiculous .

8327,"I bought this game like one year ago and is becoming from an legit game, a game full of hackers and toxic players:
-Matchmaking is so bad, u can't select the maps what u want to play.
-You can get banned for reasons like cheats and u don't use cheats (I also I got banned for using cheats and I play on Boosteroid Platform what let u just play the game and no open others programs/files/browsering/etc. only just to open the game and to play it.)
-Toxic players for no reasons in team matches for example(u can mute them but they gonna kill u and will get nothing for Friendly Fire).
-U can't choose an region to get connected and to play with players from that region and this make game more worse and laggy sometimes).
-Sometimes after landing far away and nobody was coming there u meet hackers who are already landed and looted.

For a game like this u have expectations to have an decent gameplay without cheaters or players who break the rules! But can u? No...
Now is Free to Play so well thank u so much KRAFTON for making this game more worse and all kids can join with their hacks to ruin the game of legit players!

But I am really disappointed that I can't play with my xbox friends. 
People say that it would ruin the game if it was cross platform but I disagree. I play on PC with a controller with no aim assist and I do just fine. I think that would be the solution.. just take aim assist away if they play cross platform. 
I don't feel like I am at a disadvantage but I am also really good with controller. 
I feel like this game would be WAY more popular if I could play cross platform PC to xbox and PS.
I refuse to install this game on my POS xbox one. It barely wants to turn on these days."

3. Auto reload and auto weapon pick is not available

I run far more intensive games smoothly with my specs. And then after the training, I have to get to like level 80 before I can play matches without bots.

I played it on console version and it's 100% works fine and no problems but for PC version has a problem.
I have been waiting to play the match (combat training first I have to do) but somehow it kept saying ""connection timeout"" 10 times now.
This game is so dark and cannot see anything and graphics were so bad. It feels to me I'm playing this game on Windows XP and it's not very realistic.

I was very disappointed about this but good thing it's free to play (Price was GB£25, US$35, EU€35 since it released in 2017-18). I can tell on Steam Review is ""Mixed"" Some people found it ""Recommend (good)"" and ""Not Recommend (bad)""."

8425,"This is a very fun mix between an arcade and realistic shooter, the only issue I have with it is the cosmetics system. To some people a huge part of games is seeing your work paid off in skins, but PUBG just makes that impossible. On top of basically having to pay for skins, none of them are really that interesting. For a survival shooting game I don't want to play as someone dressed in a bright green dino costume, but that just comes down to personal preference. They make the skins require an insane amount of hours and luck to obtain, most likely to be able to say you can obtain them in-game, but realistically if you want them you need to buy them. I get this isn't a huge issue, but the only thing this game really has to work towards is skins, as there is nothing to unlock that would actually give an upper hand in-game."

8489,"Well, thanks for the reminder that this game has a legit reason to die. 
Two third of the gameplay consists of running into the zone. Half of the games you die 30 seconds into the landing because u cant find a weapon. 

The devs should consider tightening the maps to give actual action.

But obv thats the way of life, old games won't develop and new take their place and even enhance the existing gameplay. What a waste of work..."

8549,this is a simple case of a game that was first of its kind and horribly mismanaged when they hype became to much for the developers to handle. refusal to region lock china led to hackers flooding the game. instead of focusing on developing content and balancing the game they focused on loot crates and cosmetics to really soak up as much money as they could before the majority of the players left. one of the final nails in the coffin for me was the absolutely horrible recoil update on ARs that would shoot you to looking straight up.

The guns, the sounds, how difficult it controls, the environment, the overall gameplay... I love it. It's imo the best BR in the PC scene. HOWEVER, I really really hate the bugs! The random crashes, the network disconnections, arrhggghhh Why? You would thought after the years since PUBG came out that they had fix most of the bugs. But nope. Tsk tsk tsk One of the best BR game marred by random bugs.

If you love boots on the ground gameplay, battle royale games, and you are a MASOCHIST (which I am). I would recommend this game. But if not, be warned. Stay clear."

8624,"Thanks for the absolutely useless tutorial that wasted almost an hour of my time. Every match is almost 50% bots, which I'd rather have an underpopulated match.

8676,"It’s been nearly five whole years since the pioneering PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds first appeared on Steam and popularized the idea of pitting 100 players against each other until only the best (or last) among them survives. Since then, the original battle royale has been locked in a fight for relevance against the many games it inspired, and only now has it dropped its entry fee and joined the ranks of its free-to-play competition. Now that the novelty has worn off, in some ways PUBG has been left wanting compared to newer and more innovative battle royales, but its unique focus on massive zones and realistic simulation means it hasn’t lost its touch either.

Survival after parachuting into PUBG’s relatively realistic open world requires you to be much stealthier and more deliberately tactical than you would in, say, the run-and-gun style of Fortnite. For example, you might wait for a passing aircraft to drown out your footsteps so you can enter a household undetected, or you might use a smokescreen to distract a squad of enemy players that are pinning you down from a nearby ridge. Firefights are regularly tense and enjoyable, though the wide selection of guns tend to be clunkier to fire than other modern shooters too (even after you’ve modded them with scopes and extended magazines).


What PUBG has in tactics, it lacks in the “gunfeel” that make games like Call of Duty or Apex Legends so enjoyable to play. Weapons are more tolerable to handle in third-person mode, but frustratingly inaccurate unless you switch to first-person or aim down sights. But since movement is clearly designed around third-person play, not to mention you get the ability to peek around corners without poking your head out, first-person mode feels slow by comparison, and the weapons suffer for it. PUBG’s emphasis on realistic bullet physics sets it apart in an interesting way, and it makes sense that hitmarkers are absent by default because PUBG wants to give you as little information as possible to make its fights more intense. But all that also means it’s not nearly as slick as, say, Call of Duty: Warzone.

Third-person play simply feels much better.

Third-person play simply feels much better, and it seems to be because your player model is physically simulated in much the same way as a character from Grand Theft Auto 5 or Red Dead Redemption 2, with a bit more fluidity in movement — so that you aren’t constantly tripping over yourself, but you still feel fragile. It’s a tough balance to strike, but it’s noticeable that you aren’t playing a game that was particularly intended as a first-person shooter when you switch over to first-person mode. Aiming down sights is also just plain stiff in comparison to any proper first-person shooter, especially Call of Duty or Battlefield."

Now too many games out there do this genre way better and PUBG will continue to die. Sad part is the people in charge will probably wonder why it died and never know how much it was their fault.

8802,I've played this game for much longer than this current account but I played it on an xbox edition. I enjoyed this game since the beginning and this game has changed alot. I think the PC version is much more competitive than the xbox version. I enjoyed both alot and I like the PC version a little more because of the content like skins and wardrobe is different.

8824,"This game had a good potential and a different fan-base until the Apex Legend has come. Although, in Asia server there is too much hacker in high rank lobby, but fortunately Apex has not that much. This game popularity was started to drop when when FPS God Shourd did leave to play this game. Now, Apex has taken the place of PUBG PC. I bought in in 2018 but, due to high requiement, my PC couldn't handle it. Now, If I go to play this game, I literally feel nostalgic after Shourd, It was such a golden days."

8870,"In the couple of hours that I played in 2022, I still encountered 2 blatant cheaters and one who might or might have not cheated. 
Reported them all (just to make sure) but haven't gotten any notifications confirming bans as of now. 
Only played solo though, maybe this isn't that much of an issue in squads / maybe the game is more fun in squads. 
Uninstalling the game for now, maybe I'll try again in a couple months, idk.
Edit: 
Maybe the duos and squads are more playable. If not, you should play Fortnite or Apex instead if you want to play a BR."

I have updated the game, my computer has no issues so this should not be a problem.  but the fact that the game is kicking me out is very frustratin because sometimes it does this in the middle of a fight, or when the zone comes. And when i get back i am already dead !

8915,Eh
8916,Played for 19 hrs and you are making me do forced training... no option to skip at all. The process of when you start you have to complete matches is horrible and it's forced. Regret buying this game.
8917,"I usually don't post reviews. In this case I will, wanted to play this game with friends on stadia, can't because PUBG corp decided to remove keyboard and mouse support to Stadia players, with the only motivation of ""because there are more people playing with controller"". 
Then tried on geforce now... removed from the platform, motivation is ""the game is already available on stadia"".
I suppose the last advice would be, then play in on steam. Yep, easy for someone with low spec pc.
Do you even care to keep your game up with players or not?"

8946,The game won't even start up.... I press play in steam and it doesn't even get to the battleye launcher or loading screen on pubg.... it was working perfectly fine before the update..
8947,"Where is AI\BOT BR Game mode? We asked about it from the beginning of this game and there is still no such option in MM. I just finished playing in Random mode, after 5 games I didn't want to play this game anymore, because I was killed in the middle of the match either by hackers or by lv500/tryhard players. This is the reason why you don't want to play PUBG anymore. Nobody wants to sweat that they will die, in every game. You have to wait 10 minutes to get into game, then get killed within the first few minutes. GG WP"
8948,"Sadly full of hackers ...

Please make this game paid again, so we can get rid of most of the hackers.

Also it would be nice to sell costume dlc's instead of overpriced lootboxes. (gambling is bad)


Free 2 Play is the worst way to sell a product in my opinion. 

Most F2P games are ending up with a worse review than the game actually is.

Edit: The situation is getting even worse hackers can now headshot you through walls and disconnect your sessions (Reporting them doesn't seem to help because of sh*tty f2p policy). Come on Krafton invest in a better hackshield."

Wanna play as beginner? Forget it.
Wanna play as beginner AND want some fun AND wanna have a nice round? Forget it too - bc this game is FULL of st#piD sweaty kids that play this game 24/7/365.

This game is the definition of ""Play against physical damaged kids where the father is still buying some milk"" bc you cant learn in this game. Or wanna play 8v8? Forget it again. Because you get killed by Lvl. 500 Kids with no life, recoil ""hack"" maybe every 2nd guy has aimbot his father or they just play as long as they control them like playing Vector as a Long Range Weapon.

9080,"Do you like pain and suffering? good news. pubg is the game for you if you just love getting cyberbullied by cheaters constantly here you go, don't forget about the micro transactions (Not that they are worth anything other than cosmic and matchmaking improvements, for only $12.00  you can waste because the amount of cheaters in this game will make you want to go back to playing pubg mobile, do not be like me and waste 75 GB's of your precious storage on a game that has a more garbage anti cheat system than warzone, also not to mention the amount of cheaters you will repetively encounter and it feels like your just wasting your time just gathering loot for the cheaters instead of having no actual chance of survivng...thanks for this wonderful experice PUBG it just represents how little you care about your player base muchless having a 'playable' game this game should honestly be removed from steam because of the amount of cheaters alone"

9108,"HOW TO KILL A GAME WITH EXTREME POTENTIAL:

1. Create a game that suddenly becomes the most popular online game in the world. (Even with poor optimizations and servers)
2 When online starts to fall - new cards and skins are added. (And not anti-cheat systems and bug fixes with servers)
4. Sell the game to China - Chinese cheaters are coming
5. 80% of players leave the game because of cheaters
6. We turn a blind eye to all the statements about improving the anti-cheat system and using the Season Pass.
8. Add bots.
9. We try the bottom, when even cheaters are tired of shooting at bots and even they leave the game.
10. Turn off the choice of map and game mode.
11. From hopelessness, you can use the game so that at least someone plays.

\\\

КАК УБИТЬ ИГРУ С ЗАПРЕДЕЛЬНЫМ ПОТЕНЦИАЛОМ:

1. Создать игру, которая неожиданно становится самой популярной онлайн-игрой в мире.(Даже с плохими оптимизациями и серверами)
2 Когда онлайн начинает падать - добавляются новые карты и скинчики. (А не античит системы и исправления багов с серверами)
4. Продать игру в китай - в приходе игры китайские читеры
5. Из-за читеров из игры уходят 80% игроков
6. Закрываем глаза на все утверждения об улучшении античит-системы и использовании Season Pass'ы.
8. Добавить ботов.
9. Пробуем дно, когда даже читерам надоело стрелять в ботов и даже они уходят из игры.
10. Отключаем выбор карты и режима игры.
11. От безысходности можно использовать игру, чтобы хоть кто-то играл."

9111,"The game is long past its peak but the gameplay itself is still the same great stuff, fun to play with friends...

...that is, when it does not repeatdly crash on you."
9112,yes
9113,"Great free to play BR! High skill gap and learning curve, but once you start to learn, it is hard to put the game down."
9114,"Honest review here from a 1st-time player.
This game is boring. 
I understand why this game was something when it was released and why it kicked off the genre but compared even to CS's battle royal it feels old, unpolished, and yes I am going to repeat myself - boring. If you have the power to stay awake and complete the basic training and the AI training then maybe this game is for you. Unfortunately, I couldn't. Yes, I was playing against AI, yes this is usually a major issue, but in my first game I spent just running from the blue field, and in the second AI game (which they force you to do if you didn't drive a car a certain mileage) I died while jumping out of the vehicle (Nice detail but it was enough to make me uninstall it after just 0.7hrs of playtime)."
9115,"I wanted to play the game, not against bots that can't aim for shit. I'm not complaining about each match being about 20-30 minutes long, but with bots that are boring and don't do much besides miss a ton, it's incredibly boring to me. TO ADD ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE TO PLAY THESE MATCHES 10 TIMES meaning before you get into the actual game you have to play 3 hours with bots unless you kill your character right off the bat each match, either way, it's boring. I wanted to kinda have fun playing against players but I didn't. Instead, I went against bots that only knew how to take cover or stand there and shoot at you. What has this game become?"
9116,https://steamcommunity.com/games/578080/announcements/detail/5524239301853416322 what a bunch of losers.
9117,good
9118,dumbass game. Played 200hrs and I reinstall the game to play with some friends and I have to do some training drill and I cant skip that shit. never playing this game again.
9119,"Shit reporting system, get reported for hacking and they kick you right off the bat and ban you for 24hrs. This ruins the game entirely. So when someone is salty at you for killing them or those type of people who accuse others of hacking cause their bad at the game, then report someone for hacking/cheating will result in the person being banned right in that moment the report is sent. I hadn't played the game in almost 2 years and hop back in, 2nd match i kill two people. Then get banned immediately a minute after killing them. This game has gone to shit since it came out."

9147,"We all know PUBG by now, one of, if not the best in its category and still addictive to this day.
Just wanted to post this as it seems Krafton is shitting on game-optimization for the last two years or so, but on these late two or three months it has become unbearable, lots of random crashes (I believe the ghosts are to blame at this point) since there is no obvious reason, I've try lots of workarounds posted by the community. One that has helped is changing skins or no skins, but still only for a while. I give one or two weeks playing other games, then comeback and it works for several days or even weeks until it randomly does it again. 
I did love playing this game and having fun with friends after my 9 to 5 job, helped relieving the stress and genuinely had fun, these days it's just a hassle to play it."

I cant even do the tutorial because its so bad. Its so bad in fact I cant even go through the first door on the tutorial (where you test to weapons i think). I even tried to get my family off my WiFi so i could try. Still didn't work. I hope that they fix the servers so I at least can play the tutorial, for now at least the game is going to be uninstalled because i don't even know what to do.

The only bad things ive seen so far is that its pretty confusing as a new player to learn all the controls/mechanics but thats something that will come with time, other then that the skill gap between the new and old players is pretty huge but thats to be expected but overall pretty fun so far."
9189,Keep your head down!
9190,"I've played on console and loved this game. Trying on PC it was too glitchy to even get past the main menu. I fought through that for 10 mins to try the tutorial mission and my controller wouldn't work. Turned off my controller and tried mouse and keyboard. That didn't work either. Sucks because it's not a bad game.
"
9191,"The game is beautiful and smooth once you get it rolling. The addition of ""Casual Mode"" is an awesome enhancement I've really enjoyed. I wish that controller was more natively supported (had a terrible time getting through the initial tutorial due to PUBG picking up both mouse & keyboard as well as my plugged in wired controller). Overall would recommend, but be prepared for frustrations when you first load it up if you plan to use a controller for gameplay."

9327,"This game is genuinely one of the worst games I have ever played. Almost every aspect about this game is frustrating or flat out unnecessary. As a fair beginner to pubg, these issues are glaring and puts me off from playing.
First off, the beginner experience is terrible. Upon starting, you cannot even begin to play PvP until you complete 10 rounds of PvE, which is a whole another chore to grind through. After completing the snooze fest that is the AI matches, you can choose to play with real people. That seems like a relief, you might think, until you realize every single match you are put in consists of bots and lvl 500 sweaty tryhards. The barrier of entry into this game is horrendous because of this nonsensical matchmaking system. Hell, not even alternative gamemodes are spared from this. I tried finding some enjoyment out of the deathmatch gamemode, but its all the same. The same lvl500s plague this side of the game as well. Before you attack me and tell me to ""get good"", realize that in every successful game, newer players are catered to a beginner experience to help them ease into the game. Its just part of good game design. However, the pubg devs could care less and it shows.
Secondly, the gameplay. There is no other word to describe the gameplay in pubg other than infuriating. The first issue is the map size. The map is just too big. Anyone who plays pubg can agree with this to an extent, even if you are a recurring player. For 100 players, maps this expansive means that half the gameplay involves walking. You do nothing half the game because there IS nothing to do. This game is basically walking/driving simulator because you cannot even find someone to fight. Also, the fights are just confusing. The game color palette is dark and grimy and this wouldnt be a problem if other players also have the same colors for clothes. This makes finding anyone on the map feel like finding a needle in a haystack. If you squint really closely and look, you might find something moving. But it will turn out to be a piece of paper in the wind. To add on, gunfights share the same problem. If you get shot at in this game, good luck trying to find out where the shooter is. There is no bullet lines or damage indicators telling you where you get shot from. There is not even a minimap that shows you the potential locations of players. Basically, this game boils down to whoever shoots first, wins. This is one of the main reasons I choose to quit this game. If the devs cannot provide players with even the slightest QoL changes, it is sign of a bad game. Another gripe I have is the amount of unnecessary and complicated buttons during gameplay. Its almost as if the devs were making combat complicated for the sake of making it complicated. If you dont believe me, there is a hotkey to hold your breath. Yes, hold your breath when shooting to make gunfire steadier. Its these little things that makes the game much more cluttered than it should be. 
Lastly, the cosmetics. Why is half of the game's cosmetics so goofy looking? On one hand, the game is gritty and realistic, with combat simulating real life gunfights. On the other hand, there are dudes in dinosaur onesies running around the battlefeild. If the devs are so deadset on making the game as realistic as possible with all the nuainces such as breathholding, why is there such goofy skins in the same game. It sticks out like a sore thumb and clashes with the game's atmosphere. It is almost as if the devs looked at fortnite and how popular it has become and tried taking a leaf out of their book. It just does not fit in.
So basically, yes , the game is bad and the devs could care less. In fact, I bet they made the game free to play after its playerbase began declining. And I can see why. If you are a new player getting into this game, do yourself a favor and dont. Im not kidding when I say fortnite is a miles better game. If you want a fun battle royale game thats forgiving to beginners, choose anything else other than pubg. Fortnite, warzone, even minecraft hunger games. I am truly disappointed in this game."

9337,"Have fun playing this game, some time the cheaters are just too much then i leave the game for a bit.  We do flag them but who know if someone actually looks at it."
9338,"I've played this game since release. While the bugs have been addressed and the core gameplay is pretty awesome, it is unfortunately way too full of hackers to actually be able to enjoy. Reporting players does nothing, the anti cheat system is a joke, and people like me (casual noobs) come up against way to many maxed level 500's, if not hackers to be able to stand a chance. The most fun I've had at this game in the last 3 years was yesterday when I completed my solo AI training missions while waiting for my friends to update and join a game.

One of my friends had a pretty decent PC and he constantly DC's  for no reason. If its not general gameplay issues and disconnects, its a hacker or an OP lvl 500 player ruining the experience.

This game used to be amazing. However way too much crap has been added to try and compete with Fortnite (stupid dances, stupid costumes). The game was amazing as it was.

Too many Hackers.
Not enough skill based matchmaking.
Shitty DLC content for cringe costumes and Idle dance moves.

PUBG sold out.. Go find a decent immersive single player game and actually enjoy gaming.."

I decided to check it out recently out of curiosity and it's actually worse than it was 5 years ago. Now it feels like this game is dead due to all the bad business decisions they made over the years and moving away from the gritty realism it had. The only people left are lvl 500's and cheaters, this makes sense as to why the game went Free To Play since nobody wanted to deal with that shit anymore.

If you want a better Battle Royale game I would recommend Fortnite's no build mode."

9409,"Nothing offers an experience like PUBG. And that's saying a lot. On one hand any other Battle Royale  just makes me want to play PUBG instead. But playing PUBG just leaves me frustrated and annoyed almost every game. The feeling of the game is fantastic. I love it and it's why I keep playing it despite often telling myself I hate the game. No other game offers the same feeling for me. On the other hand it's riddled with bug even 5 years after release and the playerbase is almost entirely nothing but max level try-hards. Me and my friends have been playing the game since it came out and it feels like we haven't improved in a long time. So if we've reached our peak why are we constantly up against player well beyond our skills? It's because of the dwindling player base. It's also why they had to ruin the game by removing third person duos. They're attempting to condense what few players are left into games. But at least they finnaly introduced a casual mode with only 12 players and almost all bots. Finally the fun of PUBG without the annoyance of being killed by yet another lvl 500 player. And to actually have a chance at a Chicken Dinner. But you can only play it 3 times in a 24 hour period. Ok no problem, Lifes busy anyway, and it's rare that my my friend group is together for more than a few hours. Except back to the constant bugs. about 50% of the time one of our friends just won't be able to load into the game. So we have to leave the match. Well that's 1/3 of the games wasted. Screw you I guess. Why not just let us play casual as much as we want? Why restrict the fun to just 3 games? If the try-hards want to play ranked they can. Maybe they could actually get people back if they fixed the game, added more actual content, and stopped focusing so much attention on the cosmetics. They made the game free and then put so much into the cosmetics you can only get by paying. Maybe I'd play more if I could at least get them by playing. And maybe occasionally spend money for some cosmetics. But there's no motivation or reason. All they care about is squeezing what money they can out of their dying game. It's disappointing. My suggestion. Just don't get into it. It'll leave you wanting more at the wasted potential.

Edit:after realizing that the steam discussion is locked so nobody can make more post I've realized the creators just don't care. Not allowed to discuss why the game crashes. Not allowed to ask why they removed thing like Third Person duos basically forcing you to play against teams of 4 as a 2 man quad. Not allowed to make suggestions. I like this game and I want to play it. But after 5 years it's still a mess and the creators appear to actively try to make the game worse and ignore their community."

9440,"My 14 year old will not stop playing Fortnite at any given chance. He doesn't want to go to bed, he doesn't want to do his homework, etc.
I picked him up from school the other day and decided to have fun with it. I pulled up in the van, got out, and stood by the passenger door as the school was letting out. The second I saw him come out the door, I yell ""HEY JACOB!!"" which gets the attention of like 300 kids filing out of the school. I immediately started doing that Fortnite ""floss"" dance (which I have seen him do), swung it 5 or 6 times, then finished with an epic dab. The crowd responded with a WHOOOOOOAAAAAA and tons of laughter. I then bowed and opened the passenger door like a chauffeur.
When he got in, I said ""Man, I tried that Fortnite thing you play and I can see why you like it so much!""
He seems to have played a lot less lately."

Go ahead and nolife for 8000 polymers because they assume you don't have a life outside pubg instead of making actual challenges like get x amount of kills with this weapon they just keep it as shit as their graphics lmao pubgs graphics is the equivilance of roblox with degrading graphics mod with 60% render scale resolution.

I like Bot matches so I'd like to fight 99 AIs instead of fighting 99 real players which some of those could be cheaters. And I despise Cheaters. Also F**k PUBG +. Custom lobbies should be free instead of being locked which not a lot of us have it and it's a waste of money to pay for something that should be free when there's tons and tons of things in the Game store.

9572,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

9637,"It's a fine staple from simpler times, but the way it tanks my internet's mbps when it runs has me spywary and the gameplay is, at this juncture, played out. I appreciate that they put in the work to make it run on mobile but it just feels like this game can't find its identity. Nothing about it is that compelling or drives conversation apart from ""What even is that collab,"" and that leaves it at risk of being forgotten. 

If there weren't all your typical scummy elements of predatory exchanges of real dollars for fake goods and said suspicious web drainage issue, I'd say it's at least some good, reliable mind-numbing, but  with those elements, what's left of this just feels wrong. I'll probably continue playing it for a bit just to really flesh out this feeling and hopefully describe it more effectively, but it just doesn't cater to the current market. Where similar titles find ways to force enthusiasm and stay in the spotlight, PUBG fizzles."
9638,I dont usually give negative reviews cuz ill just move on if i dont like the game but this game used to be actually good. They just killed it. The current state of the game is not worth ur time.

9663,"For my first round at a Battle Royale game, this honestly despite my lack of experience with it is not an awful game as most of the other reviews would try have me believe, that isn't to say that the game is difficult for newcomers, the amount of games I die in the first 2 minutes to a level 500 sweat-lord, whilst irritating, is just part of the game and any patient player can stick around long enough to learn how to get better it seams. I would also say that I haven't encountered anyone using cheats as far as I have played the game, not to say that people do use them but they haven't effected my experience thus far. additional rumours about constant crashes, at least on my system are non existent, the game crashed once the entire time I have played it for me but it still lets you load back into your previous match so its not a massive deal.

I urge anyone like myself reading this, just looking for another game to not listen to any rage reviews left by man-children who simply can't except that they are bad at something and just pick the game up, its free so like whats the downside."

9684,"Pubg. The game that was fun for the bugs, that's gotten millions to unbug itself. Somehow there are still bugs everywhere, but we love it for that. Play the game, love it, hate it, love it again. Its a never ending cycle of being bored of looting, and at the same time loving the idea of never knowing when the enemy will show up."
9685,Its f2p why would u not play it
9686,I LIKE ALL ABOUT PUBG
9687,"The game plays great, and if you like multiplayer shooters, its got good mechanics. The problem is the lobbies are full of cheaters, and have been for a while. If they ever get the cheating under control, I would recommend this game to fans of the Battle Royal genera, but until then, unless you enjoy getting killed by an aim bot, you should probably take your money elsewhere"
9688,it is a fun game
9689,"this game is literal aids. cant tell you how frustrating it is to start getting shot and have no way to tell where it is coming from, then the second you try to react you are dead. it is a loot game that leads to your inevitable death. if you rage quit, you will hate this game, if you like dying and just going to the main screen constantly you will be bored."

9692,"I played PUBG when it came out but got tired with the cheaters and janky gameplay. Having come back with some friends who never played it before now that the game is free I have been really enjoying it. I have only seen one cheater in the maybe 150 games I have played since returning and the gameplay feels a little smoother too. I would absolutely give it a try if you never had and enjoy battleroyals. Be aware that your first 15(?) games will be against mostly bots, so it will feel really easy  at first. But that might be for the best to get used to the game."

9701,"I bought PUBG a year ago and returned it as i thought it was clunky as hell. BUT when it went free to play i gave it another try and have absolutely fallen in love.

I now understand that what i thought was clunky gunplay was actually brilliant.
The game in no way holds your hand in terms of recoil. In CoD when i have a high recoil weapon, i put the highest magnification sight on it as possible as that cuts down on its recoil by an insane ammount. 
you cant do that in pubg. the recoil is the same no matter the sight, which is as it should be.
not once have i gotten a kill by accident in PUBG it is all and only methodical.
So tactical, so great. 
oh and i only play in first person and solo.
absolutely incredible game. i look forward to it when my work day draws to a close.

Only downside is there are too many hackers, frequent, but not frequent enough to completely ruin the game."
9702,I have 130 hours on this game. Yet I have to play 10 full matches against AI to actually get into the game again after all of these years? nah. uninstalling.
9703,
9704,"game good 
"
9705,"I swear to god, i was just in a game where i was like 10th or something. Im really bad at the game so it was amazing for me. Then the game just caps at 8fps... it wasn't using my gpu, i then continue to die the most stupid death, because i couldn't aim with all the lag. 

Prior to this i also had issues like the unknown crash and the startup crash, i managed to resolve (kinda) one but the other persists. the game sometimes crashes on startup but restarting fixes it, The unknown crash also happens but only a few games in (which still isn't good, but better then before).

Overall i recommend you try this game, but also shouldn't. If you get crashes like i do,  just don't. I had to skim through everything just to find out this one program open causes issues.. Fine pubg, i wont use processhacker (harmless utility i know it sounds like its a hacker tool but it isn't, search it up.) Then MSI caused some issues like my god, this is the first game where i had this many issues.

Then the gameplay itself, meh i mean it is good but if you are new you get destroyed. You get fired at? no problem! i will hide behind this rock, only for you to find out they were actually shooting from that direction. 
Running around in the forest sounds fun right? NOPE get headshotted.  etc etc. 

So in short, no but yes i dont really know. The game is fun but i want to survive for 5 min longer without crashes or getting insta killed from god knows where."
9706,i love pubg
9707,"PUBG is the OG Battle Royale, and despite having been out five years, it unfortunately feels like it did all of those years ago. The game is a mess from a technical perspective; even after five years, the game still crashes frequently or fails to start. Animations are stiff, the interface is terrible, and the graphics still require you to turn them all the way to low to have a chance of seeing someone hiding in a field or forest. 100 player matches are a thing of the past, now, you can expect to see bots in every lobby to fill up a server due to the dwindling playerbase, and only after you complete a tutorial that does little more than waste your time. The game's saving grace is that the gunplay still feels weighty and winning is still satisfying, but there are far better BRs to play than this."

9748,"The game isn’t really enjoyable unless you shell out some serious money for a top quality graphic card ($1K-$2K plus) and monitors.  The millisecond discrepancy between two players is literally the most frustrating thing I’ve ever seen.  I’ve had TOO many instances where I swore I should’ve had instakills and just kills in general and yet the damage score didn't add up.  This is what ultimately convinced me to uninstall this game.

It is very disappointing because this game, to this day, has SO much potential to get even better and become a more enjoyable experience.  Sadly, developers hardly put in any effort to make the game an enjoyable experience.  As opposed to making improvements, making fixes, adjustments, etc, they just throw eye candy at you via cool skins and other useless crap that is actually not cheap.

The shop is an absolute joke (BP is completely useless and needs a revamp).  If you want to spend money on cool skins and what not, just go to the steam market place and spend maybe pennies on the things you want.  You don’t need to spend a fortune on useless stuff unless you’re a streamer whose income relies on content such as PUBG that use these to market their content.

The developers claim to be transparent on things such as bug fixes/tweaks etc.  However, their commentary is MAYBE 50% legitimate with issues mentioned STILL not resolved AND making changes to the game without notifying anybody about them (eg parts of a player are STILL outside of building if they sit in a corner)

This game should now allow players to choose which map to play.  It’s a free game now and have bots that will fill the void if the wait time meets a certain threshold.

9818,"MENGHORMATI ORANG TUA

“Hormatilah ayahmu dan ibumu, supaya lanjut umurmu di tanah yang diberikan TUHAN, Allahmu, kepadamu” (Keluaran 20:12)

Kata “hormat” dalam bahasa Ibrani menggunakan kata “kabad” yang secara hurufiah berarti menjadi berat, atau bertambah berat, atau berbobot berat. Pada zaman kuno, sesuatu yang berbobot berat dianggap memiliki nilai yang lebih besar. Sampai hari ini pun harga dari batu dan logam mulia yang dinilai oleh bobot mereka, artinya semakin berat bobot dari suatu batu dan logam mulia maka harganya semakin mahal. Sedangkan untuk orang, yang dinilai adalah bobot keberadaan dan peranan orang tersebut dalam masyarakat dan sesamanya. Semakin berbobot keberadaan dan peranan orang tersebut maka semakin penting dan mulia orang tersebut.

Dalam bacaan kita hari ini menunjukkan bahwa Alkitab mencatat orang tua memiliki bobot yang besar. Para rabi Yahudi kuno mengajarkan bahwa orang tua harus dihormati karena mereka adalah mitranya Allah (God's partner). Mereka bekerja sama dengan Allah untuk adanya seorang anak. Allah adalah pencipta kehidupan, dan orang tua adalah media yang melaluinya TUHAN memilih untuk membawa kehidupan baru ke dalam dunia. Sebab itu, menghormati orang tua bukanlah soal apa yang mereka sudah lakukan, perbuat atau berikan kepada kita. Ketika kita menghormati orang tua sebenarnya kita sedang menghormati peran yang TUHAN berikan kepada mereka, yang olehnya kita sebagai anak boleh hadir dan ada dalam dunia ini.

Renungan bagi kita hari ini adalah: pertama, kita wajib memberikan penghormatan kepada orang tua karena peran yang Allah berikan kepada mereka demi menghadirkan kita sebagai anak ke dalam dunia ini. Kedua, kita harus mau mengampuni mereka, jika dalam membesarkan kita ada kesalahan yang mereka perbuat yang menyakiti hati kita. Jangan merendahkan mereka hanya oleh karena satu atau dua perbuatan salah mereka kepada kita sebagai anak. Jangan kita kecewa akan apa yang orang tua kita tidak berikan kepada kita, sebab apa yang mereka bisa berikan itu adalah semua yang ada pada mereka. Ketiga, jika TUHAN masih memberikan kita kesempatan, buatlah segala sesuatu yang baik dan membahagiakan orang tua kita selagi kita hidup. Cintai dan sayangilah mereka, yang memungkinkan kita ada hidup sampai saat ini. Keempat, ketika kita menjadi orang tua, buatlah apa yang baik kepada anak-anak kita seperti yang kita kehendaki diperbuat orang tua kepada kita sebagai anak. Jangan sekali-kali melanjutkan apa yang tidak baik dari orang tua kita kepada anakanak kita saat ini. Ingatlah, bahwa anak-anak lebih memperhatikan apa yang orang tuanya lakukan ketimbang apa yang orang tuanya katakan. Kelima, kita menghormati orang tua kita dengan cara menjadi orang tua yang terhormat dalam membesarkan dan mendidik anak kita. Kita dapat mengasihi orang tua kita ketika kita mengetahui berada di posisi yang sama dan melihat nilai yang sama sebagai orang tua. (YMH)

Questions:
1. Menurut Anda apa yang membuat Anda bangga kepada orang tua Anda?
2. Jika Anda sudah menjadi orang tua, apakah yang ingin Anda sampaikan kepada anak-anak Anda?

Values:
Dalam Kerajaan Allah, orang tua harus dihormati karena mereka adalah mitranya Allah.

9832,Game is made like shit ngl
9833,Probably the worst hitboxes i have ever seen in a battle royale game...

9838,It is a fun game that is easy to lose track of time playing. I do wish they would fix a few of the glitches and release a few new maps every 6-9 months
9839,good
9840,great game got it for the better gunplay compared to other battle royales plus not many kids down the mic however i feel this may have changed since it became free so i havnt gone back to it since. worth trying. cannot believe they removed my favourite map karakin. you should get this rather then other battle royales as it doesnt have building and isnt a cod game
9841,this game is the best kind of cancer
9842,",

9843,for a game thats been out so long it sure does crash me alot for no reason

9865,good game

9868,not possible to kill someone

9870,"absolute shit, need serious optimization very greedy on resources and often crushes"
9871,fuck you and i'll se you tomorrow
9872,veri gam ys gud
9873,nice game to play with friends~
9874,"my mom used to play this game called league of legends so its my turn to play it im only 11 loll but im still OK for it i just don't know if it for 18+ or not that all and  i recommend this game because its just like fortnight and 
and league to."
9875,good
9876,Its the same today as it was 550 hours ago.
9877,"Objectivelly one of the best Battle Royale titles. Skill based gameplay, score based matchmaking. Lots of ""wanky"" movement mechanics though you can get used to that.

What might turn people off is semi-frequent crashes, either from the game itself or hardware. Not sure whether or not the devs are focused well enough on that."
9878,this game have a trouble sound for close combat. is terrible a hell
9879,everything!
9880,yes
9881,very best
9882,"I love this game as you can see in the hours and hours I've put into it but at it's current state, I do not recommend it.

Bots and especially CHEATERS are effing rampant. No anti cheat and they still do not fix their game crashing issues.

Again, I love the game for it has the most ""realistic"" theme and the gun play is awesome but the devs seems like doesn't care for their community anymore and only their only focus is the cash grabbing crap."
9883,"if you want a more realistic boots on the ground style shooter, then this is it. Its not flashy and in your face, but it doesnt need to be, as it does what it does extremely well! 
the only downside is.. as its free its open to a lot more cheaters and there is a lot! but, its still a very enjoyable BR!"
9884,shits ass suck me off
9885,For the context of the platform the process is  very slow in the properties of the pubg.
9886,"even tho its a Lil dated its still as fun as its always been, takes a lil getting used to but once you do its a blast."
9887,this game is bad
9888,how people can enjoying slow game like this lol
9889,.
9890,Good game
9891,"If you Love FPS games then you must have already heard about PUBG. Once it took over the highest playing player base at one time from DOTA on Steam the glory days are gone, But it is still date the game with best gun mechanics.
Game has crashes more than other games, some cheaters very weird company management who takes the most stupid decisions,  yet it still has most loyal game followers and great community to play with.

After its gone free, if your system supports it I would rate it as a must try. you will get thrashed by lvl 500 take time to learn the game, its gun but in the end you will have a good game and may be a great friend circle for life."
9892,y

9899,"This game, where to start. I will just keep it short and simple. This game, and others like it, are typically loaded with people who don't do much with themselves. The concept is great, the game play is awful on all platforms, and you will get killed by man child who will tea bag you from the upstairs of his parents house at the age of 30.  So if the player base was better, this game would be better."
9900,aa
9901,No. I would not recommend this game to people in 2022. It has to many veterans and is to hard for noobies.
9902,good

9910,"Even thought the game has been out for years and years, it is still not stable and current crashes often on many types of PC setups. Not worth the frustration on that plus the avalanche of cheaters."
9911,Solid fun game but after 6 years it still crashes randomly for everyone stupid fucking game dont bother wasting your time crashfest shitty programming

Сделав ее бесплатной - во первых разрабы кинули всех кто платил за нее деньги, а во вторых привлекли кучу читеров и в без того загаженный геймплей.

9925,"Horrible matchmaking, get paired with either bots or lvl 500 sweatlords or hackers. Still no way to remove maps that you don't want to play on."
9926,gud
9927,"This is a great game, but there are many flaws, including, YOU HAVE TO PAY $10 TO CHANGE YOUR NAME, many cheaters, no such thing as skill based match making, you can be level 20 and get into a match with genuine ESPORTS players. But the main reason I'm sat here writing this is the fact that (like I said earlier) you need to pay real life dollars, TO CHANGE YOUR USERNAME. This is 2022, we don't need the same username system that an Xbox 360 uses, that is just absolutely moronic. Also, KRAFTON is shit, no doubt about it."

9934,"yes a i've played more than 3000 hours and still will, but it's rubbish game don't even try it, it's bad managed, doesn't have a proper anti-cheat and it has greedy system"
9935,"Pubg is a fantastic game through and through. If you're interested in this kind of game, you will no doubt want to sink hundreds of hours into it as it is easy to play but hard to master."

9947,"I´d really rather be playing Solitaire right now.
Total betrayal for those who bought this game."
9948," Awesome graphics worth checking out. Cool game play. Be prepared to die instantly when you start to join in with real people. Major downer of this game is, as many others, the match making is terrible. How does a brand new person with limited knowledge, basic skills and basic equipment go up against people that have been playing this game from day one and came from a similar game. If you tell me that isn't how it is then please tell the last guy I watched on kill cam dressed in a guile suit take out myself and another player instantly. The suit of grass was the dead give away. Not just a skin people. If it is just a skin you can purchase then this is a pay to win game. Anyway fun but very lengthy. Havn't done team play yet. Perhaps that changes things. Have fun."

9952,"Nice to play in every day{way) :) I don't know, it catched me even if sometimes I die in 10 seconds after I land..."
9953,"uhhh so I see a millon reviews saying they dislike the game now cause when you logged back in after not playing for a while you were forced to do a ""2 hour tutorial."" All you guys have to do is load into the new tutorial then push esc then leave match and you go back to the main lobby. Am I the only one who realized???"

9979,Fcking full of cheaters. I cant even play a single game without playing against a cheater with wall acks shooting me through walls with aimbots.
9980,LA FORTY NIGHTY OR BABAGEE?
9981,PUBG has brought online fps to a new level. Every time I play this game it brings me new challenge. I bet nobody can say that he's the best in this game. Some times I am very good at this game and some time I die instantly after jumping from the plane. Every day I face players better than me. And the gameplay feels different every time. It is everything you could ask from a fps battle royal. If you really love a challenging fps shooter then this is it.
9982,"It was better back then, when it first released."
9983,Everything is perfect and realistic but the aim is very hard to control
9984,"Poor optimization, random FPS drop, Sudden jump in ping because shitty server, laggy as hell, I like the gameplay but please fix the damn game. 

Also if you decided to download this game, don't allow wellbia. That shit is suspicious and the game runs fine without it."

10005,"The game is riddled with hackers. after watching the death cam and seeing people track you through walls as you your sneaking, shooting into the air and getting kills and weapons auto snapping to your head, it make it not a fun game for players. you have to be running hacks to keep up with hackers. I have also seen my own team mates using hacks while spectating them. i would have to report 1-2 people every game for hacking and thats no fun.  exp.  1 for my teamate and 1 for the peoplewho kill me."

10080,Good free game to play with friends. Slower paced than Warzone
10081,"Terrible graphics and performance (Of course you have to play on very low if you want that sweet 60 with your mediocre at best PC). You want to drive fast with your car? Well no dice for you, you get stuck on a random grass texture and die in the crash, or just take off to the Moon on the smallest bump. Wanna play with friends? Good luck to you, they will be constantly crashing, and so will be you, or just run into the sweet ""Network Lag Detected"" message. You want to shoot somebody? Enjoy half of your bullets just sublime away if your opponent kills you first, so he takes like 50 damage instead of 80. Oh and don't even get me started on your opponents, who are going to be lvl 500 tryhards who bathe once a year, regardless if you are lvl 10, 100, 500. So good luck having fun with your friends if they are new to the game. At least it's free, even though everything in the store is super overpriced, 5-10 euros for a single dance emote etc. You can't even play a single multiplayer match until you complete the completely useless tutorial, which seems to be only there to prevent you from playing. If I want to do the tutorial, I will, but if I don't, then let me play ffs. Most of the maps are fine but I would avoid Sanhok if I were you, it's painfully bad in my opinion. So yeah, this game can be fun for some time, but it won't be if you start to take it too seriously, then it will get real frustrating real fast."
10082,so fun but so mid
10083,I Am BlackBoard

10086,just no
10087,people that are level 10 vs people that are level 500
10088,"This game has a good concept.
I was one of the many unlucky people who bought the game years ago.
Back then the game was very good to play, enjoyable. 
First very bad thing of it: they make it free
It's like saying ""good job idiots, you wasted 20 bucks on us now piss off"".
And adding salt to the injury, in many of the games you will play, there is someone that plays with cheats or hacking and its natural, cause they don't perma ban the cheaters and hackers and if they do its no big deal cause the game is free so they come back easier than before. A good solution would be a ban system like APEX has that literally bans your motherboard but they will never do that cause they will loose people.
In other words, this game has become heaven for those who want to experiment with hacks or cheats and the developers do nothing cause they know the number of users will drop down very much very fast.
Overall, i don't recommend it. Playing this game solo is bad BUT the squad system still works its way out.
If you have friends,then i truly recommend to play it, not for the game experience, but only for the laughs you will have with your friends while playing this game."
10089,fun
10090,"Every wheelchair using person i have ever met, run better than this game:/
Its an enjoyable game, worth the price."
10091,crashes all the fucking time mid game

10093,1
10094,fun game for playing with friends
10095,Still super game but bad updates

10097,Babaji
10098,Good game apart from the chinki's
10099,"Honestly never really gave this game a chance at the first release. Currently playing and waiting for the new cod and have found this quite enjoyable. Not something i would put 70 days into, but definitely something free and enjoyabel to hold you over from boredom of waiting for a new game."
10100,NICE GAME
10101,"It forces you to go through a simple tutorial that if you've played any other battle royale is absolutely useless
once your done with that, you would think that you would be able to play the game now right? nope.
NOW you have to go through multiple AI matches with no actual players and most of the game you can't even find anyone
it seems to take about an hour+ to get to public matches, so yeah no thanks."
10102,The OG of BR. It's free and still frequently updated. Give it a try.

10106,I have a 3000 dollar laptop and this game randomly crashes and network lags all the time. Do not buy it. Wish I didnt and have that 30 bucks back...
10107,"Fix Bug, not adding costume, know the priority. The developer does not fix bug, update their anti-cheat and optimize performance. I bought the game at 2018, but it's just hard for me to enjoy the game when cheaters and serve performance issue is still a thing after 5 years of fixing."
10108,"This is a trash game they ask how it is........ crap, people toggle on and off allllllllll the time , shouldn't even be allowed to play there game if you want to cheat stay away, devs obviously still don't care,  or just are making enough $$$ to not give a crap, crap game , crap play, cant find 1 single match without multiple cheaters, truly sad/terrible ."

10124,epic
10125,"Great stuff, awesome team building."
10126,still fun
10127,"I actually like the game. The thing is, I can't play it for 10 minutes straight without it crashing and/or not responding in every single match, since the latest Update. And it's not a cause of bad driver, broken system files or the game in generell having been installed properly. Because I tried every single solution that I could find, and nothing seems to solve the problem. Also I got a pretty good CPU and great GPU and enough RAM, so that is not the problem either. So the cause is PUBG itself, for some reason not able to work properly for 15 minutes straight. And I hear I am not the only one who has similiar problems. I am hoping on future updates to fix this, in the mean time I am back playing Apex, because that at least runs like heated budder :)"

10132,i get far more joy out of doing drive-bys and stunts with a mountain bike and a nagant revolver than I do trying to get a chicken dinner.
10133,"This game is total ***! It's cheeks. The mechanics are terrible, graphics look like an old ""wanna-be-realistic"" flop from the early 2000's. Games that try to make things look, or feel ""real"" miss the plot. It's a clunky POS. The core of any shooter is the combat, however this game's combat is not fun, and totally inconsistent. I guess people just want to hide in bushes, and waste all of their time. They should just do something in rl instead. WASTE OF TIME!"

The challenge where you have to do 2 headshot kills x survive as one of the last 5 players is close to impossible to do because of them, i killed 2 people, 1 headshot and the other i failed then i went to shoot some more and ofc 2 500 lvls teamed up on me from two sides great no? Fix it please."

10226,no thanks
10227,Ever since bots were introduced to the game it went downhill. Atleast 50% of the lobbys are filled with bots. Doesn't matter if you are level 10 or 500. Only ranked mode is kinda ok.

This is very unfair to those who play the game properly and join a solo match expecting to be matched against solo players, not squads of 2 or 3 players that make a truce and gang up against other solo players. There is an option to report teaming but this problem still persists in almost every solo game that I've played so far (and you can probably tell from my playtime that I have not played for a significantly long amount of time)

This spoils an otherwise fun and enjoyable BR game."

10407,"Honestly if you're looking for a game to get mad at, but keep playing this is it. Grind away in one match for 45 min just to get clapped by a sweaty lvl 300 player from a mile away. Would recommend 10/10"

10429,Since going free to play honestly been really enjoying playing it again. Just ticks all my boxes when you have a squad to play with
10430,"+ Top-class gun play, very satisfying and realistic, there's nothing better
+ Addictive
+ Good looting system
+ Randomness of the circle means you can play the same map forever and every game is different

- Hard for beginners
- Lots of highly experienced players who kill you in seconds
- Beginner modes like 'casual' (with bots) are limited"
10431,no
10432,Overall a good game
10433,"Pretty much just hide and die, but in a good way."

10437,worst game I have ever played
10438,"chronic game crashes. But when it isn't crashing, its fun!"
10439,"decent game, pretty slow paced though something that I do not like personally. Also this gets pretty boring playing alone but still got lots of fun to play with friends. Would recommend it only if you got some friends to play with."
10440,"This game is like dating an alcoholic. They're a lot of fun to be around, and you legitimately like them. But they have serious problems that ruin the whole relationship. You keep thinking they'll change, but they never will. Instead they'll just try to sell you an Event Pass to see parts of their body."

10446,"This game is absolute n1 of my worst played games in my entire life, its so garbage that even when I have 1k+ hrs in other fps shooting games, here im literaly getting 1-2 kills in 10 matches. Another horible thing is that krafton is super  lazy for making balance matches, cuz even if u are lvl 50 you will play with maxed 500 lvls. so stop playing this trash."

10453,I love this game because i like the bots because they are the same skill level as me since i am paralysed from the neck down i can also 360 noscope jess and timmys dead body as well as josiphene can just follow me around and be clueless and get shot every 2 seconds because she is so bad at living life so i sent her to the streets. #blessed #tothestreets the gas reminds me of when i was back in my day getting gassed by all the mini hitlers so i start having a stroke every time i am not in the zone because my ptsd is that bad. I can also drink alot of redbull and become kyle and start hulk smashing all the females near me. I also have a fear of heights so i dont think its fair that i have to drop from a plane like why cant i just walk all day every day oh wait never mind i forgot i am disabled. Ive had many viatnam flashbacks from this game thank you for making me relive my best memories. back in my day i even changed teams and started gassing everyone i saw instead.
10454,"No, terrible company."
10455,umm
10456,I love PUBG even though I get clapped by better players regularly. Since it went free to play it has been easier to get a game. I'm slowly getting better and maybe in another 5000 hours I'll be  the one  doing the clapping...

I can't whole heartily recommend it theirs so many games out there that have adopted the battle royal genre, and have executed it frankly alot better. *cough cough* Warzone *cough* even though im not exactly a big fan of the genre, the idea has been built on elsewhere and has surpassed pubg. It was good while it lasted, you'll be remembered pubg but for how long i wonder."

10605,most real game out there!!
10606,"Long learning curve but if you stick to it you will have the time of your life with or without friends to play with. This game is not like call of duty it takes a bit more patience and calculated movements to defeat your enemy through sound ques like footsteps and recoil control with pulling down the mouse.After you master the basics its all macro managing from there you start to learn how to predict end game scenarios so you can put your team mates in the best possible position to win.You can also play solos/duos,TPP/FPP, and they have an arcade mode and training ground where you can start before getting into a live game.I really love the game despite the bugs it has it really has been an adventure and i always come back to it from time to time i guess you could say this game is a love/hate relationship ""dislike on occasion for better words"" give it a shot no pun intended (and there is bots in the game that help fill the servers hopefully one day the games popular enough to where its not needed or less are added)"

10617,"After reading all the bad reviews about hackers I was very dubious of comming back to the game. I decided to give it a try nonetheless.

The game is in a very healthy place at the moment and I have no idea what all the complaints are about.

Sure, compared to the first 2 years of the game, now you have some stupid skins, a few silly mechanics and optional battle pass crap BUT if you ignore all that the game is still there and it's still very fun.

On the bright side of new features, now you have a lot of different maps, new gadgets like an anti blue-zone consumable backpack, recon drone, decoy grenades, and others.

If you like the genre, if you played and you are hesitent to come back or if you want to try something new: I recommend it."
10618,veri gud game

Only downside all the damn heavy ass updates."
10625,"It's incredibly difficult to even reach the skill FLOOR. After 1000 hours, I even struggle to average 0.5 kd. I don't care about being competitive; however, I do care about having fun. Low KD doesn't matter, it's the fact that the game has NO ranking system. You'll be paired against SEMI/PRO players even if you can't shoot straight past 15 meters. Despite removing 99.9% of the cheaters, it is still not a game of genuine challenge as your opponents have already won before MOST engagements. It's like playing amateur basketball, but the opposing team is the Lakers. You have no chance, and they might as well be cheating (they're not) because you have the same fighting chance. 

I'd recommend the game even if it had 10 min queues with SOME rank matchmaking. At least then it'd offer a genuine (surmountable) challenge for non-competitive players. For the same reason, they need to take unbalanced lobbies as seriously as they would cheaters. A game can't be fun if your opponents have a game-breaking outsized advantage (whether that's from skill or fraud.)"

That being said the most disturbing thing on pubg is the  clunky movement. Every  BR needs  a decent movement. This BR's  movement is a total mess. A week ago i gave it a try again after a 2 years break and literally 2 rounds later  uninstalled it after my bored ""genius"" random  squad knocked(TK) me for NOTHING. Dont wanna any part of it.

Стрелять из снайпы и не понимать трассир пуль из-за того что автоматически убирается прицел после выстрела. Пытаться поднять мейта и на  мининаносекунде случайно отпустить кнопку.

It has the following major problems:
- No matter how many hours you have in the game, it forces you to do 2-3 HOURS of training before you can play. I really can't figure out why ANYONE on the dev team ever thought it was a good idea
- Despite several large updates, it seems that its bugs (which many others have told about) will never be fixed

BUT, if you can get past that, its pretty fun

Man they really screwed the pooch on this one. 

DON'T PLAY THIS GAME. Seriously. It was amazing once. Now it's a husk of its former self. And you know I tried to keep soldiering through, even when they made bad decision after bad decision and the player base shrunk and shrunk. But this most recent update (patch 17.2 I believe) is the nail in the coffin. The game crashes constantly. Dropped frames, ping spikes and fps dips more often than not. Awful design choices with no way to revert to the system that has worked for years. Makes my 2080 scream while much more demanding games run smoothly. 

Do yourself a favor and pass. Play Apex or Warzone or Fortnite or whatever other BR actually gives a damn about their players. PUBG Corp have showed time and time again that they just don't care, no matter what they say.

Early on in the game they failed to gain control of cheaters and now that has evolved to widespread issues where several high level gamers are leaving for other games.

They have even had some of their internal workers arrested overseas for providing cheats on black markets."

No map choice. Visually distracting highlights on what loot you should pick up (cannot be turned off).

10774,"If youre looking for the worst game ever made, look no further. Lets start with the fact that 1 of the 4 players black screens after EVERY round no matter what. Pathetic. On top of that half the time you engage in a battle, the game lags and freezes and unpauses with you dead. Perfect. Ok so its a shooting game and you cant stay connected or shoot. Gotta be the end of the list right? No. You buy skins and dances and tickets for events and they steal your money and say you never used the item even though you have witnesses that prove theyre lying, but do they refund you or give you what you paid for? No. They lie and change their story, make excuses, disconnect you from their customer support, refuse to give you to a superior and block and dismiss you for being upset. They have not fixed issues such as building loading issues that make the game unplayable even after 5 years. The only consistent part of this game is failure. This game fails at every turn. These garbage devs should go back to app games because real gaming is miles and years ahead of the skill level of their horrible staff. Absolute con, you got better chances of winning the lottery than anything on the crates, don’t waste your money on this crap, I’ve spent about £1000 trying to get an outfit and all I got was duplicates, it’s a con of a game. Never ever gonna play this junk again Why the fuk did you make this game free if your servers could not handle it. Bluehole you motherfucers are so useless you remind me of a kid with no legs getting a car. Your game can't handle 100 players and is giving network problems.

YOU NEED TO FRICKING CHANGE THIS BECAUSE IT IS AS IF YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THE SCREEN THAT I AM BLACK WHICH IS WHY YOU ALWAYS PUT ME ON THE BACK. #RACISM

As someone who played this game over 1000hours.

All i can say is this game is utter b.s.

Some true words, when I was playing this game back in the day, the creators of this game destroyed the game by not helping players in any way shape or form. So people started to leave the game.

After a big loss of players... VOILA PUBG announced that this game is now free to play but ranked is 12 dollars or something.

A year later, I said lets give it a try again.
I am a skilled player dont get me wrong. Out of 10 games I usually get the chicken dinner.
BUT DUDE.. since i came back all I see is Wallhacks, Aimbots on Autorifles, and 0 recoil macros.

These people are utterly discusting. I do my job on reporting people, but all I see is literally people getting banns for 2 days.. OK ? let that sink in...

2 DAYS PUBG are you for real?>??>?>??>?>?>? In a game where you have to wait a while to get into a game, until u get killed by 1 cheater.
There are literally in every game.
And there is 0 chance to win against them if you are a legit player.

Miss the good old times.

10825,only game where you get to use a variety of modern weaponry and more of a realistic FPS and Battle Royale.  The game although is not like others has set the tone for BR's from the beginning and continues to still improve while sticking to its core game.  Dont listen to the big streamers or negative comments.  If you look it is still one of the top paying Esports and continues to have a dedicated player base.

Lapor BBC, kapal selam itu yang membawa 53 kru dilaporkan terputus hubungan selepas meminta kebenaran untuk menyelam ketika sesi latihan torpedo.

Kapal selam yang berusia 40 tahun itu ditemukan dalam keadaan pecah kepada tiga bahagian.

10842,"I actually adored this game at launch. While I have a lot of memories with it most of them aren't great. The only reason I remember spending a lot of time in this game is largely because I was with my friends while playing it. Gameplay-wise it's extremely clunky and will frequently skip frames or straight up crash. I can't tell you how many games I've lost JUST because my game crashed. As I've said in other reviews, my hardware is above average. If this game has issues running on my hardware I can't imagine what it's like for people are less expensive computers. I still think this is a better battle royale than Fortnite but the game just feels unfinished, for a variety of reasons.

Plays like Battlefield, but worse

10866," Its fun to be in the game. Graphics and game plan is attractive. Constant positive updating keeps the game entertaining. I am 65 years of age and has played more than 7200 hours on it in last 3-4 years. Have played other games like Ace Combat, Vice city, Ark, COD, CS, Valorant, Half Life, Flight Simulator, Resident Evil, AOM, and lot more in the last 22 years. But i have spent maximum game hours on PUBG cause its been a enjoying entertainment to me. Only thing I wished that there were a  language translator particularly from Chinese to English and vice versa. Most other Southeast Asian countries Gamers speak and understand reasonable English and so communication is possible but not so with the most Chinese Gamers who are the major game participants. So my request to PUBG/Krafton is to incorporate such translator. This will certainly benefit the gaming community in this Asian sector and increase participation. I know a lot of Gamers who have left PUBG and shifted to COD cause of language/communication difficulty and not because of the game in particular."

10880,"It's pretty much like Fortnite minus all the crazy colors and absurd skins. If you think you would enjoy Fortine if it was more like Call of Duty, this is your game. 

Weapons are fully customizable and the combat mechanics are amazing.

Even though it’s not as popular as Fortnite, It’s still very relevant with its continual updates, Esports teams, and ongoing support.

Practicing with the AI makes you feel like you're actually really good at this game. Joining a public lobby will quickly change that. Just keep practicing and you'll soon make it to the top 10 along with seasoned veteran players! 

Highly recommended for fans of Battle Royales that look and feel a little more real."

10882,"Been playing this game since the very beginning and I have to say, its the one Battle Royal game I will play and its also trash. It comes so close to being its own unique piece of the genre, but its clunky nature (which has been inherent since day 1) always manages to trip you up when you start to find a groove / can mindlessly enjoy it. What do I mean? Well if you have bad luck, the game punishes you with long wait times to get into each game, so if you make mistakes / want to get better, its hard to get back into similar situations where can improve a skillset. Doing well? Well get ready to get wallhacked and aimbotted, cause it happens pretty commonly. Watching your deathcam is pretty much required as most barely try to hide their lack of skill as they aim at you through buildings / terrain, pop a grenade and land it directly on you without ever gaining line of sight. Its one thing to get bested by a good lvl500 player, its frustrating to constantly realize you were cheated out of yet another good game. Don't get me wrong, the game has had many improvements in terms enhanced quality of life over the years, but fundamentally, it still just doesn't know how to deliver a consistent good time.

Frankly though, if they ever truly got good at weeding out hackers, I could possibly recommend it, but that on top of it still not being a polished experience would let anyone trying to come in fresh down."

10892,"Come back after 4 years, i gotta admit, its been upgraded big time <3"
10893,"My view of a game so far.
I wanted to buy PUBG long time ago, and thing that deter me from buying was enormous price for the game. For that price you could get decent game that has wonderful singleplayer and multiplayer options. 

Now that game is F2P, and after so many videos watched of this game I had to try it. Soon after, when I noticed price for ""Premium"", which in my opinion reflects real value of a game (12,99$) I decided to buy to support creators and developers.

It is true, there are lots of high level players, what else would you expect of a game that is 6ish years old. There will always be better, stronger and more hours spent on game than you. You just need to play to get better.

On the off hand, literally first day of playing, couple of hours in, some player made suspiciously good headshot,  I played 'deathcam' and his aiming were looking kinda off. I reported him for cheating, didn't specify any specific reason of a report. Same day, about 6 hours later I receive message saying they banned the play I've reported. From what I've heared there are more than few cheaters in game, but on positive note they did notify me of a ban and it didn't take them whole lot of time (unlike Warzone, who by the time I stopped playing did not use anti cheat system)"

Oh, and that one map (at the time of writing) that has very little real estate that's not buildings. A variety of modes are here, and the UI is easy to read with big numbers for the important things. Details are a little fiddly once you get down to it, and some features (like the optional death cam) make me think it was once different. The shop is unintrusive, though the costs are quite high if you don't have a lot of self-control. Good game, if a little dated."

Although this is the original ""battle royale"" game and it shows in the overall graphics, if you want a down-to-earth BR shooter that has bullet physics (drop over distance), doesn't hold your hand like that other BR that puts a spotlight on the end of your scope so that it's easier for people to find snipers, doesn't force your character to dress in bright colors to make it easier for others to spot you (although some of the skins you may end up buying will do the same, but at least it will be on purpose), and has a more reasonable time-to-kill than the more sci-fi BR games, then you'll end up coming back to PUBG, or finding a home for the first time in the genre.  It doesn't have the smoothest animations or best gravity constant (never been sure why), but spend enough time to ""get good"" and overcome your fear of hot drops once you know the map a little, and you'll be having fun before you know it.   This game is infinitely better with friends, so go get yours or make new ones in random squads."

10977,Besides some serious cheating the Admins are swift in booting them from the server. The take away is you spend ten minutes looting to build your character and hope you don't spend the next 20 minutes to make it to the zone without being picked off. After all that if you are taken out by a cheater then it was all worth it.

11006,"It's almost unplayable. I try to play for fun with friends but it's just ridicolous that in every match we all get trashed by some random 500Hrs mate. We all are >100 in the game. Also it's unplayable for newbies cause matchmaking has dumb rules. Fix this shit right now. I could easily say i'm not the only one who sees this. 

So inconsistent it pains me every time i open the game. Also, performance is an issue. IDK why 5 years later i still have randome lag spikes or render time issues with this game. Yes, it's better, but it's still frustrating to get into a fight and constantly get 300ms render delay. 

For real if you want people to come and stay you have to address some of your MM issues right now. Else players will keep leaving

11028,"I read somewhere that this game has a ""flat learning curve"", which makes no sense until you play for a while and realize that it's almost impossible to improve. I want to like this game. I want to like it a lot, but it's not fun. Maybe it is for people who have been playing for a long time, but fighting these people as a newbie is ridiculous. Basically you just run around for a while collecting all kinds of gear and weapons that you will never use, and then get shot to death before ever seeing where the enemy is regardless of what helmet or vest you're wearing. The game looks great, and everything works really well, but grouping new players in with veterans is not fun for the new players. And it's not like I've never played a video game before. I played Pong at my neighbor's when they got a home consul for Xmas, and I've been playing video games ever since. I was very good at CoD, and other FPS games, but this shit is just frustrating, and weirdly stressful. If they just want to maintain some kind of elite game for elite players, that's fine, but I'm not spending a dime on this game if all that happens is I run around for ten minutes, and then get gunned down out of the fucking blue. There's no way to learn anything if you never actually get to play the game."

11113,"Player Unknown Battleground, or better known as wait 7 minute to land and get into a game and die within a minute. Rinse and repeat. 

In 2022, in order to play a game,  you need to wait 5 minute to get into a single player game with bots. 1 minute, count down for the game to start, long introduction scene for a plane, which at the earliest, takes 1 minute to land. All in all, Player Unknown Battleground, isn't really a battle ground. It's a bunch of people wasting their life away waiting for a game just to start. 

Most of the time, you wait four minute. One minute for the game to start and one minute to get on the actual ground. It states, estimated waiting time is 1:10 seconds for example. This is varied, the actual waiting time can increase. The current average experienced for me, is five minute and fifty seconds. 

You would get into a map to WAIT for the game to get enough players AND THEN start a minute count down, and it will still take you another MINUTE to get onto the battleground. 

Game is fun when you are not waiting. In my honest opinion, this game is literally a waiting game. If you have nothing to do for twenty five minute, you've be looking at your screen and see little to no actions at times and come out winning. The reward for winning is minuscule and the amount of fun you may have is subjective. 

There are different methods of winning of course, but I often find myself waiting for the circle to close, to find any opponents. I often find sea servers people camped, literally outside of the house, building etc. Incredibly frustrating after waiting average of four minute.

There are elements of fun, but there are also quite a number of hackers to make sure you don't have too much fun. 

The Aeroplane scene and landing takes, at the earliest, 56 seconds by the time you get onto land. I cannot stop mentioning, how much you stare at your screen before you have get any action. 

May be I don't have as much time as I would as a teenager and time is worth more to me. Nothing is worse than coming onto a game on a Saturday to wait average four minute to get onto the battleground. I do not want to spend four minute staring at my screen for copious amount of time doing quite literally nothing. 

In conclusion, the idea of winning seems to be greater than actually winning. It provides an illusion that through winning, it would be a momentous point where the game provides a greater reward, but in reality, you have just wasted thirty minute of your Saturday squinting at the dots that might be people. I have found lots of plants in the distance that looks like players. To my massive disappointment, it was just another plant.

You have people from USA that cheats to get ahead in life. You have people from SEA that cheats to get out of life. Pretty funny to be honest."

(over 550 Hours now)
so your mileage may vary depending on your location.

The Game is fun, even better with friends. if you have a group of friends that like to have fun and talk some shit whether you win or lose, you will love this game.

If your hoping at this being a top notch BR experience, some might be disappointed. it has some issues, yes there are bots, you won't get full servers in OCE unless playing FPP Squads during peak hours. but there is nothing wrong with that. want to learn the mechanics and get better with guns and still bump into the occasional person in a match for a bit of a challenge. play during off peak. but warning. it doesn't prepare you for playing prime-time in the slightest haha.

you will get wrecked.

the graphics are good, the game runs good (for me at least).
rarely any crashes or game breaking problems.
you will see comments of people calling this game an unplayable mess due to the bugs, everyone has different hardware. might work for some, might not work for others. nothing is perfect.

the game does receive regular updates. though not on the same level or pace of other BR titles.
but they are slowly making progress.

this is definitely not a twitch shooter, you won't pick up the game and be a god at it over night, the more you play the better you will become as you understand the guns and their recoil patterns. people will try and play this like COD and get destroyed and then complain that either the game is shit or their opponents are hacking.

Deathcam:
the death cam is not perfect at all.. absolutely nowhere near.
some death cams looks like your opponent has snapped onto you when if you go into the match replay mode you will see they haven't. looks like bullshit but turns out it isn't.

playing in OCE i've encountered maybe one or two hackers in the last 11 months or so.
but again, depending where you play, more people=more hackers.

so there is some good and some bad, all in all it's a fun game solo, even better with friends.

but please Krafton, for the love of god, give us FPP Solo back in OCE.

I understand dying to someone better than me, but when you watch the kill cam and it's someone snapping to your forehead from 100 meters away and you insta die, Or if you watch someone have zero recoil and their gun has no attachments, along with then tracking through something from a long distance its annoying and it makes you not want to play the game. video game companies need to do something something about their anti cheat. It seems like Valorant and escape from tarkov is the only games that give a shit. There are ways to create a strong anti cheat and it has to be inside the script for the game to make it less vulnerable to people scripting these cheats.

11205,"PUBG is the original battle royale success. Yes, it's a janky shooter adapted from a mod, and yes the cosmetics are more often than not utter garbage. However, no battle royale on the market right now really emulates the formula PUBG got so right in 2017: a semi-hardcore, no frills, classsic battle royale experience. The weapon recoil is meaty, and the TTK can be super fast if you're caught out of position. The almost-bloated set of controls it borrows from ARMA add to the feeling and atmosphere of PUBG. 

Gameplay-wise, PUBG's high-skill movement and recoil create a layer of complexity over the simple BR game mode. After hundreds of hours I am still learning new tech and ways to utilize equipment and the environment. Driving is also incredibly fun; car handling feels appropriate to each vehicle, and the game gives plenty incentive and opportunity to use them. On occasion however, inexplicable sharp bumps in the terrain will have you scratching your head.

As for flaws, my biggest gripe with PUBG is the cosmetics and monetization. This game follows the old lootbox model, one of the most unsatisfying ways to earn cosmetics and a great way to enable gambling addiction. On top of that, the vast majority of the cosmetics sold in game are either terrible or hyper-tailored to PUBG's Korean market, with KPOP marketing deals and accompanying attire. Fortunately, this side of the game can be ignored, and you can find some of the older skins on the steam marketplace for pennies. The one area in PUBG's cosmetics I will praise is the esports integration.

Getting into PUBG as a newcomer may be hard, but if you feel the style of PUBG's slower pace and semi-hardcore combat is for you, try it out and see if the formula sucks you in."

11216,"yes

11217,"The game is much more realistic than literally any other battle royale out there, there is no OP weapons as every weapon kills in about 4 shots or less so its really down to personal preference. Younger players will find the game insanely hard nowadays as the game has been out for 4 years now and most new players when they run into an actual person, will get stomped. The game has a free version now that runs better for lower end PCs, however the Steam version is still the best, the console versions, including stadia are god awful and mobile is a completely different game"

11223,"Back in the day, when this game first came out, it was great. Yeah, it was only one map, and yeah, it was a little rough, but it was still fun. The game was going somewhere and looked like it was going to be a really great game...and at one point, it was. However, things started going down hill fast. At one point, getting a sniper rifle or a designated marksmen rifle was rare, and now, with just a few minutes of looting, almost everyone has one. So, instead of a ""battle royal,"" it's a total camp fest. Things also don't seem to sync correctly. In other battle royal and fps games, when you shoot at your target, you're either hitting it because you're aiming at it, or you're missing it because you're not...with this game, I've unloaded a full-auto blast at almost point blank, aiming down the barrel at my target, and I've only hit them twice? Then they turn around, seemingly only hit me once and I'm dead? Then you watch the death cam, and you see a bunch of blood coming from your target, meaning you've hit it more than twice, but apparently, you've only done like 12 damage...point blank, with a 7.62 round?

Let's not even talk about what happened to the game once they made it free to play. First, the ""reward"" for the people that bought the game before it was made free was a joke and a spit in the face of it's loyal players. Next, it opened the door for cheaters. Now, I'll admit that cheaters have always been a problem, but not nearly as bad as it is now. What's to stop people from cheating on a free game? The matchmaking in this game is also a joke. I'd rather sit and wait to get into a match knowing that I'm playing against people at or at least near my level...however, instead, you're either thrown into a bot filled world that are so easy to kill that you could probably walk up to them and slap them to death, or you're thrown into a world with a bunch of lvl 500s that have probably played this game so much that they're unaware of the world around them. I've won a few matches, and I've lost a few matches, and while I'll admit, I don't like to lose, I'd at least feel better about losing if it somewhat seemed fair. The fact that almost every death feels like you got cheated is enough to make me consider never playing this game again."
11224,"The reason this game is free now is because it is over whelmed with cheaters and level 500 players. If you are new the training tutorial is great but you only get 10 matches and the fun ends there. you will be matched against level 200, 400, 500 players that have been playing since day 1. So if you like to jump from an airplane collect some loot and get your head popped by a cheater this is the game for you"
11225,"shoot

11226,pew pew pew
11227,a truly miserable title. the fact people enjoy this game proves the need for increased mental health funding worldwide. pubg players need to be put into mental asylums.

11262,"The Game was realy fun, back in the days. It was sometimes buggy but nowadays it is just not playable. Ive got a decent computer and no problems in other games. But pubg is the only game that crashes randomly, stutters when you are in a gunfight and has random blackscreens after matches.

Its just frustrating and the bugs are known for longer then a year now.
They made the game free2play to sqeeze the last bits of money out of it."

11326,"The game is garbage, but the good kind of garbage. Y'know, the one that doesn't rhyme with ForkKnife, nor make the level of money that nightmare does."
11327,"I truly enjoy this difficult game that is known as PubG. This game does take some time to get used to. But that is why this is game is so fun. It's a grind. It's not like Apex or CoD. This game actually requires skill as there's no aim assist. I have almost 600 hours on the game now and I can confidently say this game does require patience and grinding. You will get better at it with time and effort. This is not an easy game by any means. If you want a game that rewards you for playing on the sticks with aim assist, go play apex or cod. Otherwise, take the Ls as they come and just get better. P.S. TDM and casual modes for new players are going to be your best friend. I was playing TDM until I reached level 300. That's when I felt confident enough to take my skills to the BR mode. This game is very fun. Would love to see a revive system though. I think that's all this game really needs."

11334,"If you like battle royales, then play, its not for me though."
11335,"Played it a bunch when it first came out, decided to revisit it for a quick match. Crashed twice just getting to the main menu, then stops you from joining a game before doing ""all AI Training Drills or play 10 AI Matches"". No thanks. Thought I'd at least get a single game in before uninstalling again"
11336,I play this game at pretty bad FPS and as you know it would make gameplay pretty unfun but pubg is fun no matter the fps and it is fun.
11337,"PUBG has changed a lot throughout the years, but there's still nothing out there quite like it. You can't find another semi-realistic squad-based looter-shooter that gets it so right."

11344,"Most of the remaining playerbase are max level and the barrier to entry is immense. Want to play their ""casual"" game mode with bots to have fun with your lower level friends? Better avoid the team of try hards who are there to ruin  your birthday and farm the bots for currency. You only get three a day so enjoy them while they last. Get blasted by those level 500s right off the plane? Too bad. One of your three casuals is still gone. Want to have fun custom matches with your less than 10 friends online? Can't fill with bots or have maps smaller than 4 square kilometers. Want to have a stable gaming experiences with no network lag/lag spikes at pivotal moments/full on game breaking crashes? Maybe not for you. Have fun for your first 3 casual games in the night and then get ready for frustration as you get dominated by level 500 after level 500. No wonder the player count is dropping. Make it more accessible for people who shower."

11417,"Let's be real here, in my personal point of view, I definitely have always preferred PUBG over Fortnite and alot of that comes down to the realism and survival instincts when it comes to gameplay wise, on the other hand Fortnite is nothing but a cartoon like shooter that's all about building those damn structures. PUBG like I said it usually focuses more on realistic gameplay that has to do with seeing who the last person standing will win while looting for items to use in combat while trying to keep yourself inside the ring without dying from like 80 to 100 different people. 

If you've ever watched the Hunger Games movie or another one that came out of Japan from the early 2000's called ""Battle Royale"" then basically that's what PUBG is. Sure it does have it's own problems with the game here and there like the cheating part and honestly I totally agree, I do think the cheaters do need some kind of punishment if they're caught otherwise. Although there was a time when I first started playing this game earlier this year when I was in practice mode, I had a bot literally kill me without aiming down their sights which that I wasn't mad about or anything but, I thought it was very weird to me at first and luckily I still have a recording to prove all of this.  

So far from my experience though, I haven't really dealt with any cheaters or hackers as much as other people have given my over 20 hours total playtime of this game like a casual gamer like everybody else in the crowd. 

Also I was able to make a few friends with others on PUBG through the use of Discord and while sure yeah we were pretty horrible in a few matches from time to time, it was still pretty fun getting those kills and what not. 

All I can say is that I enjoy PUBG for what it was going for and while I haven't been able to get a winner winner chicken dinner in the game I still enjoy it for what it is. If you're someone who's got tired of playing Fortnite or you're someone like me who is bad at Fortnite, then please give PUBG a go, because I promise you that you will not regret it especially given that the game has been free to play for about a couple months now at the time of me writing this. 

Also, if you're someone who has 4 GB of RAM or less, then I don't think you'll be able to run this game, I ran this game on my new gaming computer around the same time this game went free to play back in January and oh boy it looked amazing on my new computer. Of course given that I have 16 GB of RAM, I'm not sure what it could've looked like on my old computer with 8 GB of RAM but, I'm pretty sure it would've looked a lot worse since my GB of RAM on that old computer was horrible for the time plus I still would've had to pay 30 dollars to get PUBG but luckily I don't have to worry about all that anymore. 

I think that's about all I have to say, if you have any questions on what I've mentioned or said, then please feel free to reply to my review and one last thing before I go, if I had to give a rating for PUBG on PC, I would give it an 8 out of 10. Alright that's my review bye!"

11483,"Garbage. 
Hear me out. I used to be really into PUBG and loved playing it constantly. Decided to download it on my PC and get back into it. However I can't even PLAY the game. Not only did they add a stupid training requirement to the game before you can play with friends after the INITIAL tutorial but the game won't even allow me into the training grounds. Not when the server keeps crashing and an ""unexpected crash"" message appears and asks you to provide details to help fix it. However when trying to add onto the unknown crash message it doesn't even allow me to type into the detail box besides their already generated message for the devs."

-solo is filled with 4 man teams (not to mention half of them are blatantly cheating anyway)

I could go on about the actual content of the game and the, especially about how bad the final circles are, but you won't make it that far without a full team, and never in solo."

11511,"Quite a few AIMBOT cheats and Wallhacks!  Completely ruins the gameplay looking for anyone that's genuine looking for a fair game.  My friends and I have observed this countless times :(  Very unfortunate, as this would be a great game otherwise.  I had encountered an interesting character called LAZY_TROOPZ, while looking at my deathcam footage, the mini map was showing that character exactly where I and my team mate was at along with the directions we were looking.  Probably be worth the game dev taking the actual time to review that footage and ban that player!  Clearly using ESP there alone, not to mention an aimbot was used by them!!!"

11533,Great BR especially since its free now just wish it was cross platform with console and mobile so i can play with more friends (casually of course not competitive cross platform)
11534,nice game
11535,I think pubg movement should be improved because most of the game nows are smooth and subtle but its mecanism is slow

Now that it is a free play title the player base has expanded so why wait, get in and get gunning. Watch out for the landmine in the store though, just because the progressive skins look cool just know that you could ultimately purchase the real life version for the same money at the end of it all. Some Mini transactions are NOT so mini when you see the odds. If you're playing to just be a player and have fun you will love this. Always an opportunity to go ranked and show the pubg universe how you roll so to speak and run over your competitors on the PCS stage in the esports arena also.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

Based on a true story, a crash and a bluescreen [first ever bluescreen in like 5 years since i switched from Windows XP] in one game. PUBG is merciless and I'd recommend to anybody feeling dark thoughts, as this game made me realize how much worse it could be.

11715,"Ok. Here we go. I had a shitty PC back in 2017 and i started playing PUBG Mobile with Emulator. Made so many good friends and improved my logic about Battle Royale Genre. Then PUBG Lite came. Went to e-sports area with that game. Made money from tournaments but it lasted short (R.I.P). Then i upgraded my PC and tried Steam PUBG. I mean this game is immortal. It can lose players but it will never be forgotten. If you didn't play any shooters it's going to be hard for you. Skill-gap is HUGE. Even with 10k hours players struggle with this game sometimes. Still though, give it a shot."

11736,"Not worth it, constant lag, instantly get killed when you lag since it could skip 5 seconds, horrible servers. Get thrown into matches with people who have spent hundreds of hours in the game and probably spent money on it to get better than you, at least it was free and I didn't waste money on a garbage game. Not worth the frustration of taking 5-10 minutes to get into a game to die within a minute, some people will say well get better, hard to do when you constantly die over and over hardly getting any game play. Complete and utter garbage of a game. Uninstalled as it just ins't fun.

Adding another issue, physics are terrible, literally watch the bullet travel, because you can see a bullet that breaks the speed of sound, yeah not going to happen unless it is a tracer round. Very few rounds in this game are sub sonic, even those cannot be seen by the eye."

This makes my naked character drag down my morale and ego. The game is also not realistic as I am nothing like my character. He is probably six foot 180, while I am four foot eleven and 430. I think allowing me to truly express myself for free, and instead I have to give my money to a game with worse graphics than among us when i used my semen as thermal paste. The onyl good part about this game was the pewdiepie bridge moment, and that was not the game, but instead the beautifully racist community."

11853,"I still has a bugsince 2020 when I move my mouse it delay, not recommended"
11854,"My opinion is very biased since I'm not into realistic or tactical shooters and prefer more ""arcade-like"" unrealistic shooters, but for me, the game felt really unpolished, really slow-paced, I hated the gun recoil (I don't care if it's realistic and you just have to ""git gud"". It's not fun and that's what matters the most in videogames). It takes forever to walk from one place to another in a large map since there are so few vehicles around, the game's intentory management is horrible (there's no color coding on attachments and you just have to memorize everything and you can't just glimpse on items and immediately know what goes where etc. unlike in Apex Legends). Fortnite also has a much simpler UI that (just like Apex) has color coding on items so you can immediately see what item is better and there's no tedious management involved.

My opinion is biased but if you're also a person who's enjoyed Quakes, Unreal Tournaments etc. in your childhood, PUBG just doesn't scratch that itch and I'd recommend something like Fortnite and Apex Legends way more than this. The tempo is greater, there's more fun to be had and they just seem more polished overall."
11855,"Even after many years, they could not optimize the game.

- FPS and network lags
- extreme CPU usage
- game freezes
- game crashes (to desktop, etc.)

It's so an useless s-h-i-t, but there are nice skins and a nicely gleaming menu system."

11921,"The game is what i want from one BR game. It has the aspects of survival and FPS with realistic elements. Coming from Apex and Warzone (my previous BR's that i've played) the game is much more hard and punishing, but for me this is not a negative, since i'm competitive player and i like to be engaged. Gun play is good, it takes a skill to shoot the weapons (not like in WZ that there is not much recoil at all or aim assist), there is no corny aspects that make u rage as in WZ ( Dead silence, Ghost perk, Heartbeat sensor, UAV's) or the  ability spam and armor from Apex. I know theese games are all different from eachother , but they are all BR's and for me (in my eyes) PUBG is proper BR game , how one BR should be. Now by no means that does not mean the game is perfect. It has its flaws, but overall i like it and i will keep playn for sure. (Where Apex and WZ lost me and i never gonna go back to them). Plus the game now is FREE. What more u want? If someone of u that never played this game and wonder...i recommend it.. give it a try."

12033,this a really nice game but hack so many.. shame on this game
12034,Abysmal server status right now and they haven't even fixed the servers in 5 days. Enter a game with ping 60 and then freeze for a minute with 10000ms waiting to be shot by everyone. I'll delete this review as soon as they decide to do something about it. DO NOT download the game right now. you will be disappointed
12035,Funny game
12036,"Its a hard learning process, if you aim too get good. I find it fun, im usually a try hard anyways in competetive games as is the case for this title. But warning bring a friend or three, solo might give you heart flimmer or worse, Resident evil jumpscares dont have shit on what youll experience in pubg thanks to ""tactical gamers"" or just sadistic kids, i dont know.. my life span is shortened by 3years thanks to this and i get scared of everything i have too interact with humies for."

12046,"i held off on this game for a long time, and in a way i'm glad i did. I'd heard about bugs and issues. But at its core, pubg is a very simplistic BR. You can choose to go barreling into the enemy, or be stealthy. The fact that people can't change position easily makes fighting more tactical than swinging on a zipline or using a jump pad like in Apex."
12047,"game is very fun with friends, how can you not love running someone over and them screaming slurs at you. its great. 10/10"

It's boring and runs like shit. Seriously, why does it take 3 point blank shotgun shots but 2 rifle rounds from miles away does the trick? The most fun I had in this game was jumping out of windows."

12228,"I love the game however, where it succeeds in being a game, it fails in morals.
Don't be fooled, it's made to keep you playing, ALWAYS, you'll get addicted and think of it always, humble request, don't play it, it stays in your head and some kids change because of it.
Second point, and most noticeable, it has ton of innuendo, sexualised clothing for women, all of them almost, I tried, being a disciple of Christ, not to pay attention to them but even the Battle Pass has them, strip-club clothing, and some clothes even show exposed underwear, parents beware this game is although innocent in action-wise provocative content, it for sure fails and is too sexualised in terms of women's poses in stores/item-shops and clothing itself is over exposed and over emphasised. Furthermore, the ease of gender switching your character is as if to add insult to the wound as it almost encourages people to change clothing, giving players a temptation of trying on clothes for the other gender, I am speaking from experience. the game even allowing to strip them to their underwear, at least not fully naked thank goodness.
Reviewed by a 16 year old boy. Kids, do yourself a favour, listen to my advice, I loved this game from the age of 6/7/8-ish, I was majorly disappointed, even Fortnite is sexualised now, it's hard to find a pure game nowadays."

12231,"I just played this game for the first time in probably 4+ years. 122 of my 123 hours of playtime were from the first year the game dropped.

Downloaded and installed the game today, hopped in, and what do I get? 

A notification telling me that if I want to play all the other modes (arcade, normal, hardcore, ETC.) I have to take a basic training course and then play 10 matches against AI. 

So I after it taking THREE ATTEMPTS to get through the basic AI (I kept losing connection to the servers for some fucking reason, why the fuck does your tutorial need to be connected to the servers?!) I played an AI match. 

And after realizing that it took me nearly 30 minutes to complete just one match alone and that I needed to do that 9 more times, I decided that PUBG is scuffed and I uninstalled. 

I'm going back to Apex or Warzone or even Fortnite Zero Build now.

UPDATE: Apparently there are challenges you can do, and if you beat the challenges, you can get access to the real multiplayer sooner than completing he AI matches. That or if you have friends with the true multiplayer unlocked, you can party with them and play against real people."
12232,"You insist on imposing something stupid like 'reputation level' on players and demoralize them. The players naturally don't want to wait too long because the server doesn't fill up quickly or they don't want to watch when the team plays and die, they want to start a new round, so you can't punish the players, this is unfair!.
Also, it would be better if you bring us the option to choose a map.'Of course, if you can stop making items for the store ;)'"

12322,"They need better control over the hackers in this game, 90% chance you will get killed by one of these sad pathetic hackers each and every game. Not even remotely fun or competitive like this. Dealing with people's aim snapping directly onto my head every time, dealing with recoil control hacks, dealing with crazy unbelievable aim assist. This game is extremely abused by hackers and cheaters and Bluehole, or whatever they call themselves, couldn't care less to prevent or stop it. Never seen so many hackers in a game before. Doesn't even matter if you have the drop on an enemy, doesn't even matter if you're on the complete other side of the map, they will find you and aim bot you with 0 care about how obvious it looks on the killcam.

12347,"I bought this back in the day, played for awhile before the ""Seasons"" were really a thing and occasionally come back. Dropped it as they pushed for it to become an ""esports"" franchise - servers were bad, lag was bad, vehicles handled like cows with rockets on rollerskates and rather than addressing issues they just started offering cosmetics. Yuck. 

Noticed it went F2P recently, so I gave it a reinstall.

It's been... interesting. Some things feel much smoother, hit detection feels a little better - but the continuous streamlining and removal of options is frustrating. The bots are still garbage and they're populating servers with them now. Cheating is *still* rampant. Like literally 4/5 matches I've been domed by someone who has been following me through terrain and then snaps to my head. Drop rates are insane (who needs care packages?) Being forced to play AI missions after clocking so many hours seems like a slap in the face. Krafton (nee Bluehole) doesn't care, they made their money and are swallowing up dev studios left and right. 

Eh, for the price of free give it a whirl if you've got the space but it's still a buggy mess. Kinda fun to play with friends until you hit that match with some script kiddie who's just lazering everyones heads from a billion miles away."

12391,"The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hit points, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks.
The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a Mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring.
His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider.
Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings.
Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby."

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

12410,"[h1]When the Koreans (KRAFTON) bought this game back from The Chinese (Tencent 操你妈 Valorante 习近平 June 5, 1989), I had my doubts. I just couldn't believe they could save the dumpster fire it has become.[/h1]

Some back story: despite the meteoric rise of the Battle Royal era at first, and all the big streamers streaming PUBG, the game gradually died out due to lack of attention by then new owners, Tencent. With game-ruining bugs and servers filled to the brim with bots, the fate of the game seemed to be sealed.

All changed when the original developers, KRAFTON, bought the rights back to the game. The old developers clearly care a lot about their baby, and it shows by the amount of love and attention they give to it. 
You can expect:
[list]
    [*]Constant bug fixes 
    [*]Constant addition of new content such as new weapons, gear, maps, mods and more.
    [*]Fortnite-level of collabs (relatively, consider this to be their eastern counterparts), such as BLACKPINK and NieR:Automata. 
[/list]

Granted, PUBG mobile does get a lot more weapons, content and collabs added to it than the PC version (They literally got an Among Us collab lmao), but the trend is clear: 

[b]The F2P transition brought the game back to life, and the developers seem vigor to make it stay like that for as much as possible.[/b]

If you are looking for a challenging Battle Royal shooter with a high skill floor and an even higher skill ceiling, definitely give PUBG ago. Steep learning curve but tons of fun with a friend or on your own."

12419,After a solid 1446.6 hours of game play I have come to the conclusion that this game is a huge pile of steamy poo. You sit for 5 - 30 minutes in lobby waiting for in game lobby which you then wait for another 2 - 15 minutes to get into plane to play flight passenger simulator and then go sky diving for 1 minute. You then land and proceed to find shelter and a possible weapon which most of the time is either a crowbar and a pistol or a shotgun and some armor. After picking up these items you walk in any direction and die. I think people should spend their time on pornhub instead of playing this game when most of the time you're already playing with yourself. GG. this game sucks. buy something else. rollercoaster tycoon is more fun.
12420,"PUBG can be fun but really annoying.
The game is much more realistic than literally any other battle royale out there, there is no OP weapons as every weapon kills in about 4 shots or less so its really down to personal preference. Younger players will find the game insanely hard nowadays as the game has been out for 4 years now and most new players when they run into an actual person, will get stomped. The game has a free version now that runs better for lower end PCs, however the Steam version is still the best, the console versions, including stadia are god awful and mobile is a completely different game."

12473,"After 250+hrs on this game It's become painfully obvious that this game only continues to exist so the developers/creators can continue to profit from in-game transactions.

The real big part of the update is usually the in-game store. This place is just full of cringe, mostly. You can earn BP in game that you can use in the store to purchase items, but it seems like less than about 15% is avalible in this BP currency, everything else will cost ""gold"" which can only be obtained via buying it with real money.

12549,MY MOST FAVORITE GAME EVER!!!!
12550,"this game holds a place in my heart based purely on the bias that i played the mobile version for a long long long LONG, time, it is a very different game to those you might be familiar with, it is a very physics based game, adding to the challenge of playing by making it difficult for you to treat it like a normal FPS shooter and having to focus on the environment a lot more, and teaching you to be strategic with what you do.

i had a lot of fun playing squads and cooperating with a team.

However.  i will say that the game is hard to master, i haven't gotten to the point of full understanding of the game, i haven't played the game in a while since i found it did not keep my attention, i found i was closing the game either out of frustration from my not being able to give enough shits to continue playing the game because of its lacklustre amounts of excitement, combined with the games difficulty to get the hang of,

or because i kept thinking, ""i could be playing something else far more entertaining"" the game just doesn't have much action, and while yes i understand that that is what some fan bases are looking for in a game, even when it does come to action, i spend more time coupe'd up in a house under a window, or stuck behind a tree sculling down energy drinks and pain killers, just so i can actually fight my opponent.

the game has realism, i get that but it is just not very forgiving for a persons lack of understanding of that, a game with this kind of overly realistic game play makes it a very difficult game to get into and while I'm happy to recommend this game to someone who is looking for that in a game, its just not a game i would play very often nor a game i would strive to master as someone who likes the works such as the call of duty series, grand theft auto single players, and CS-GO, call me uncultured for being someone looking for more action, or (as i was expecting from this game), strong flavoursome action that keeps you wanting more (seen in games like Escape from Tarkov)

unfortunately i find this game lacks that, while its fun the first few times you jump in, i will usually close it after that"

12552,"I like the concept of battle royale, but it's not close to reality, I don't live in America to have weapons, so I prefer it to be more Balkan, the loot should be unfinished cigarette butts and beer bottles, the weapons are stones or any tool used by a farmer.

12579,"First off, my game was performing excellent! But then I loaded into a game for the first time and I was shocked as my mouse movements in real life did not coordinate with the movements in game and as a result there was a big delay which stopped me from having fun and actually playing the game. Anyways, if anyone knows a fix to this problem it would be greatly appreciated!!"
12580,This game still has such optimization issues everytime I try to play it. Off and on for 5 years now. It's a fucking joke
12581,"For the life of me, I cannot stop playing PUBG, even after five years of playing. Despite the many flaws, it is the archetypal, meat-and-potatoes battle simulator where gun-play is the focus and not cheap gimmicks or special character-based abilities. Positioning, timing, wits under pressure, and a bit of luck are the centrepieces, the pillars that support the game.. The randomised human behavioural component keep matches fresh and unpredictable. While solo and duo are now hard to come by, I feel the real fun comes from a full squad especially if you're all friends and it is reflected in the consistent numbers that game-mode still receives. The maps are generally well planned out that offer a variety of angles and strategies on the fly. If there were any criticisms of note, I would point to the developer's focus on paid skins rather than focusing on long-demanded glitch fixes or minor quality-of-life improvements. They are slow to respond unless a hot-fix is required. Obviously, cheaters can still pose issues so I recommend viewing death-cams regularly to check for snap-on targeting and/or recoil control usage. However, the game has aesthetically come a long way from the pre-official release and looks rather stunning on higher graphical settings so if that's your thing, you've got something in playing PUBG for its occasionally photo-realistic landscaping. After viewing old footage of the game, it then becomes rather apparent that there was a considerable effort to brighten and sharpen the image. 
To this day, I believe the game itself still holds the Steam record for all-time concurrent players and there have been some epic, much better video games that simply could not eclipse those numbers. While we may never see another battle-royale type wave that swept through 2017 onward, PUBG continues on unabated as a free-to-play. Time will tell if PUBG still resonates as its shooter competitors CS:GO and the like. 
Peace and chicken grease!"

12653,"If you don't want to read my PUBG life story, short answr, F yeah, this game is iconic, nostalgic, and unuque. it helped spawn a genre, it's visceral, it's immersive, it has some wonky mechanics but honestly I like it the way it is. seems like the new devs are on point, new weapons are , dope, and this game has always had cosmetics so shut up bout that, I think they're p worth irt and none of them are totally cheesey unles it's on purpose. it's good, it's free, honestly the mixed reviews are haters and it's a good time when you don't wanna go all serious tactical, but don't get me wrong, this game has good action if you wanna go off. Also love the Tdm mode for gunplay practice, and the practice range is amazing for trying weapons and getting your settings right.

Not sure about the new support team, but like the last one was horrible so same same.Had to Start a new Acct. Bc Even tho I showed screenshots from Steam Support saying My account was Hijacked for two weeks (I got taken for a fool w a man in the middle with an incredibly realistic looking login page in an E mail. dude Got me banned from a game w 0 customer support so i'm Salty i lost all my og gear and a bunch of unopened crates from season 2, but hey, this game Really feels unique  after playing all the BR games it inspired subsequently. Everything is incredibly customizable features with really intuitive sliders from values of 0 to 100, and you can do all kinds of stuff w per scope sensitivity,. I use universal for muscle memory but that's I'm trying to get across the point. you don't have to adapt much to this game, it adapts to you the point is to make it feel right for you. that move in reasonable increments for fine tuning the new team an email w screenshots from last time, so here' hoping i get all my crappy skins back lol I can't believe how fun this game still is. I a day one player, wish i woulda pre-ordered tho, that player unknowns trench coat you got w the pre-order set sold for 779$ I opened one w some short shorts, worth 459$ on steam market  and another w a military cap w a headset for 259 on the steam market at one time, 10$ investment. I Sold them immediately for Steam bucks, I could buy any game i wanted for 3 years, and if a homie didn't have a multiplayer game I need a squad in I'd gift it. PUBG kinda started that whole loot crate craze and cosmetics etc But that's Bc this game was so hype for awhile mf's would pay almost  800$ for a cosmetic item, a damn fine one albeit. that woulda been amazing to exit w loot like tarkov, I used borrow that coat from people I smoked, Imagine how High stakes it would be if you could leave w an item work 750$."

if your looking for a rage induseing broken gameplay game, def try and play this :)"
12678,"I'd really like to save you some time with this review, so I'll just briefly bullet my main complaints.

It's been out for this long and still can't go more than a few games without crashing. Performance varies wildly between maps, with newer ones having a tendency to remain more stable.

I get that it's gone F2P, but the microtransactions are utter garbage. There isn't a way to acquire any usable amount of premium currency without the battle pass, which itself is a raw deal compared to others in the genre. Earnable currency is a joke, if you'd like a certain weapon skin you've got exactly one shot at it per week, and lets just say the odds of getting what you want make actual gacha games look fair. Even if you decide to sink money into it, there aren't any guarantees on crates and I'd implore you to look elsewhere.

Certain modes are dead, first person perspective ranked effectively doesn't exist. Apparently choosing which map you'd like to play on is also too much to ask,  so try not to get attached to anything in rotation because you might not be back for a while. 

Look, I've got a steady group of 4 that plays this game semi regularly, and all of us together (which is by far the best way to play this dumpster fire)  can't really take more than two or three games at a time. So to boil it down, I'd say pass all together. There are better battle royales, and even better shooters. Hell, drop some cash on Arma 3 (this game's ancestor) next time it's on hyper sale and try out the gunplay there. It's shockingly similar and unlike this game, it's actually fun.

12721,"The devs actually managed to make the game worse overtime, haven't played the game for years (was legacy), tried it recently, and it's embarrassingly sad that there has been 0 innovation since legacy and they haven't done anything but add a few more guns, more attachments (really innovative /s) and a battle pass (for fuck sakes its the same exact map as when the game launched), it's the same slow clunky choppy animations and movement (however, they somehow made it worse since legacy) , clunky/choppy gun placement and aiming as well as broken bullet drops/bullet travel with constant camping. 

There's been 0 QoL improvements overtime. This is embarrassingly sad, the original was somehow way better than the current state, that's an incompetence accomplishment in itself. The graphics look the same as before, and they managed to make the slowest paced BR on the market even slower by having other maps be completely open in their 'remastered version' (i.e., they removed cover and made their redesigns open).

This is the first shooter that I've played where I generally don't like sniping and I've liked/enjoyed sniping in every shooter/fps I've played, it's clunky, the bullet travel is wrong as well as bullet drop. Somehow Fortnite has better and more realistic sniping in it and that's a kid's game (Battlefield still remains the gold standard of sniping mechanics).

This is definitively the worst BR on the market at the moment (I actually don't know how you can get worse than this other than mobile games and it's clear their priorities are mobile development), PUBG is definitely the slowest-paced, and likely the noobiest Battle Royale on the market. As always, plagued by hackers/cheaters. 

TL/DR: The game was made by total noobs for total noobs.

At this point, I don't think Koreans can make a good or proper game and I generally like Koreans."

12789,"PUBG is a game about putting your head in the toilet, so naturally it includes an achievement called 'Take a dump, sit on it'

In all seriousness, in the past we’ve seen a fair number of achievements and trophies for people who have made the time to get their toilet bucket up to a certain level of filth. Now there are two more achievements aimed at those determined who have made it in their bathroom but with a few more conditions, and the first is 'Take a dump and sit on it'.

It requires you to use a 'dump mat' and be in a position where you can actually sit on it afterwards. What do you need to qualify for that you might be asking? Well, first you need to need to have your toilet bowl at least 25 degrees (so that it fills up) and also it must be one you own and use regularly. How much filthier can you go before you actually fit in the hole and then proceed to sit on? Here are the requirements:

25 degree water temperature: The required water temperature is in fact 26-28 degrees Celsius for PUBG, so your sink/basin needs to be at least that hot. If it's not, you'll need to buy a new one before you can claim the achievement.

The required water temperature is in fact 26-28 degrees Celsius for PUBG, so your sink/basin needs to be at least that hot. If it's not, you'll need to buy a new one before you can claim the achievement. 'Dump mat': There's a specific 'Dump Mat' that is required. There's nothing worse than your new toilet taking a dump on your floor or worse, your hand. It's got to be a mat that fits the size of your toilet bowl. You don't have to actually have it in your bathroom, you can buy it online from the in-game store if you want. It's the cheapest item there, you don't need to buy the whole thing, you can just buy the mat and take the rest with you.

There's a specific 'Dump Mat' that is required. There's nothing worse than your new toilet taking a dump on your floor or worse, your hand. It's got to be a mat that fits the size of your toilet bowl. You don't have to actually have it in your bathroom, you can buy it online from the in-game store if you want. It's the cheapest item there, you don't need to buy the whole thing, you can just buy the mat and take the rest with you. Proper toilet seat: Not much to say here, obviously if you need to sit on your toilet then you need a proper seat.

This achievement is still under discussion on the PUBG forums so it's not yet been confirmed for everyone. So far, a few people have said that this achievement has already been implemented but it's not available for everyone, so it's not yet official. This is a good way to fill that space and make everyone else get dirty."

Also your computer performance is important. Your ability to play good is tied to your gpu and cpu power. If you are not getting triple digit fps you cant play good reliably, you cant win clutch fights, cqc's. That's it for now."

12819,"this game bankrupt me. i am now living in a grit bin outside my friends house. my nan has severe depression and because of this i have had a lot of time to listen to her reading shakespere acts; this is my favourite 


''They met me in the day of success, and I 
have learned by the perfectest report, they have more in

them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
to question them further, they made themselves air, into 
which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder 
of it, came missives from the king, who all-hailed me
'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title, before, these Weird 
Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of

time with 'Hail, king that shalt be.' This have I thought 
good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness,
that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to
thy heart, and farewell.'
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
What thou art promised; yet do I fear thy nature –

It is too full o'th milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great,
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,


That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,

And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'dst have, great Glamis,

That which cries 'Thus thou must do' if thou have it,
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither


That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,

And chastise, with the valor of my tongue,
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crowned withal.'
to sum it up, in the wise words of joe hart 'ITS DECENT'

12911,I really like this game but playing normal matches are hard because im new on this game (but ive played on xbox) and im getting paired with enemies whoare the max level and i find thst hard for new players so thre should be some sort of matchmaking that pairs lvl 500 with lvl 500 and lvl 10 with levl 10

Trolling teammates is a lot of fun and so is playing alone and with friends, can get a bit frustrating when you get killed by someone with more game experience than you tho. (skill issue)"
12917,"The game is going through constant crashed for MANY players.  The developers don't seem to care about their player base, especially in NA.  They constantly make poor choices, then end up having to nerf them or revert them all together."

13015,"Game is so bad dont even bother, anyway here is how to make brownies:



Step 1, Melt the butter with sugar, salt, and cocoa powder. Here is where the saucepan comes into play. Make something called a double boiler, a fancy term for a small saucepan filled with an inch or two of water set over low heat. I place a bowl with the butter, sugar, and cocoa powder over the saucepan and watch as they melt into a gritty-looking mixture.

This process helps to create that crinkly top we all love. Heating the sugar like this helps move it to the top of the brownies when they are in the oven, which is how they get that shiny top.

Melting the butter with sugar, cocoa powder, and salt.
Alternate methods: You can complete this process in the microwave (many of our readers have). I prefer the stovetop method since I know it helps achieve that beautiful crackly top. You can also melt the butter into the sugar and cocoa in a saucepan over medium-low heat. The double-boiler is a fail-safe against scorching the batter, but as long as you keep the heat to medium-low and stay close by, you should be fine.

Step 2, Add the vanilla and eggs. We use two eggs to make the brownies, but I add them one at a time. I add the first egg and mix it into the butter, sugar, and cocoa powder. When the first egg is mixed in, I repeat with the second egg.

Step 3, Add the flour. After mixing the flour into the batter, I beat the batter with a spoon for 40 to 50 strokes. The batter will be thick. This extra beating makes sure that the butter emulsifies into the batter, which makes sure the brownies bake perfectly in the oven. I usually tell you to be careful not to over-mix batters on this blog, but that’s not the case with these simple brownies.Adding 1/2 cup of flour to make extra fudgy brownies.

Step 4, Bake them. The brownies bake in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. I’ve dedicated a whole section below telling you how I tell when brownies are ready to be pulled out of the oven, because nobody wants an overbaked brownie, right?"

13092,Had to play tutorial after 300 hours of legacy play.  Honestly if I could get a refund on this game I would go buy a sick other BR like fortnite or hello kitty adventure island.
13093,nice game
13094,ITS FIRE
13095,"Great game, but getting temporary bans for being good at the game is ridiculous, anti-cheat system need alot of work"
13096,"I appreciate the Battle Royal with realistic parameters such as bullet drop, and real weapons. I wonder if there was a little more time between circles, or if the blue zone closed a little slower, if there would be more time to hunt. There are so many cool parts of the maps that would be a crazy urban fight but it feels rushed a bit. Then again, I do like to snipe so I have more patience. Keep it up crew, the maps and game play are great!"
13097,Finally FREE 2 PLAY.
13098,I wish I had had more fun with this game when it was popular. Haven't played since going ftp. Wish I hadn't spent $30 or whatever on it.

13100,hella fun! good! easier than turkov and arma less complicated
13101,It's lost its touch over the years that drew me too it. But it's still a one of a kind and original battle royale that I will continue to play as long as they keep up with the hackers which is the sourest part of the game.

Everything Crisp, Bullets go where they are suppose too, and the GUNS feel absolutely amazing in your hands. Very impressed with the Sound! Both from the guns and the everything else. I appreciate the grind to Lvl80. Gives you something to work towards! Maybe its cause theses kinds of games are difficult for some people thats why they dont like it but everyone needs to give it a try for themselves. I am definitely a fan now."

13111,just a good game init
13112,"It is a decent game and it could be fun. But the game constantly puts you against the bots that are just standing there confused. They seemed to go into implementing various mechanic akin to mobile games that are designed to drain you of your money in order to give you any chance of enjoying the game itself.

It is a money and time sink robbing you of what online games are supposed to be every step of the way.

13114,"It's a realy fun game, they've added(and removed) lots of things since the game first came out almost five years ago. It's a very fun battle royale game and the only one i still currently play, it's outlived Fornite, Apex Legends and so on for me. It's just really fun.

...But the technical part, lord have mercy. This is probably the most horrendously programmed game I have ever played. Even to this day it still crashes randomly. I've played this on three different computers and specs and it still just wont f**king work. Laggspikes, crashes etc. I can't belive they acctually said that this game was e-sports ready in 2017. Like legit, this is the worst pile of crap I've ever seen in my life when it comes to the techaspects."

It's legit an idea that me and alot of other people like. Could capitalize on that, put yourselves back on the map for a bit and get some new players in the process. But nah, you'd rather have people to pay for the privilege of being fucked on by cheaters and for skins that are overpriced af. Stay classy PUBG Corp. KRAFTON, and especially you Tencent. You fucking paragon of class you."

PUBG has good graphics, decent controls, a lot of different types of weapons, venichles and etc. But I find this game quite alright, I'll still rather play Fortnite tho cuz' that game is funner. That's pretty much it I guess =)

13148,"I came back to this game after not being able to play it when i first purchased it due to a bad connection.

I was happy to find that it now ran great and connection not an issue.

150 hours later and I finally look up why so many people are acting strangely only to find they forced bots into the regular rotation

These bots fill player slots, can see through walls, spawn in on the map instead of parachuting, theres no way to know how many of them are taking up player slots until after the game is over (https://pubglookup.com), in fact, they cant even be clearly identified from other players except for the fact that they look like they move on rails and make terrible survival decisions.  There is currently no way to option them out (Ranked mode does not have bots though you are forced to first person and cant play solo) and they are very unlikely to be removed by the developers ever.

Anyways, if you plan to try this game, know that the fundamental gameplay is really addicting though these days you are probably playing with 50% bots unless you have a considerable number of hours in game.

Positive review as soon as option to disable bots is provided."

13199,"Game itself is well developed: cool graphics, nice sound effects, movement, driving etc are also cool.
BUT: just let us play like 10-15-20, or limitless casuals/day. Normal matches, ranked matches, arcade etc. is all about camping, either you play TPP (3d camping) or FPP (sound camping) is the same.
No need them ""git gud"" comments, most ppl have life, work, studies and/or both etc. Most ppl just want a bit of fun this game CAN provide, but DON'T provide. It's not only the game's fault, but ppl's. That's why the 6mill+ playerbase is now at around 600k (max 1 mill). 5mill decrease toiok only 4 years! :)))
But what can we do? :) Nothing, so let us play limitless casuals. 
If ppl are not interested in casuals, they just won't attend any, so no fears, but if they are (coz they are), that's a good critics. 
Simply test it for like 2-3 months. Trust me those, not sweaty boys will appear. Also, sweaties'd be unpopular for attending casuals, so more chance to enjoy the game as a ""noob""."

13205,"On the whole its a pretty good game. There are minor cons that really seem to bring it down. The sweaty level 500s.. just get a life bro go outside touch some grass. Second of all, allow which maps we want to play on really annoying that people can’t choose that but its also understandable so that actual people get put into matches not dino suit bots. Thirdly, the game is great by far the best BR made, people complaining that is dead can be fixed if your lazy ass gets up and actuall ly starts playing it instead of bitching and whining that its dead… the more people that play the bigger the player base gets now especially with the game being ftp. On the whole great game good potential even after 4-5 years just up to the devs now to keep it alive and meet that potential."

13337,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

13427,"Have been playing PUBG since the beginning and it was a blast playing with friends , but the lag and bad fps drops back in the days ruined the game for us and we stopped playing since 2018/2019. When the game got free again we have picked the game up and play. The game finally feels playable and smooth compared to PUBG in 2018/2019. Definitely recommending you to play if you have 3 other friends. This is because DUO FPP  has lots of bots in compared to SQUAD FPP. Never played TPP so no comment.

For returning players , the tutorial might take sometime which i think some of the ppl who returned to the game are quite unnecessary but it was easy to go through if you know how.

Pro
1. The game feels smooth/good FPS rate.
2. The introduction of the korean map is definitely fun to play with as you can revive in casual.
3. Having regular friends to play with is really fun and lots of funny moments.
4. Hackers banned really fast after you reported them.

Cons
1. Game startup takes an awfully long time. (Having the game in an SSD, not recommending to play this game if u have HDD)
2. When exiting to lobby , sometimes you would encounter black screen / infinite loading time which takes us back to the (1) issue where you have to reopen the game.
3. Not fun when playing solo.
4. Rarely encountered hacker but they do exist, we even beat some noob hackers sometimes and it is really satisfying.
5. Bots are there during odd hours when most of the players are not online and unpopular game mode. (E.G Duo FPP)"
13428,"This game has some great qualities, game play is smoother than ever, maps are generally solid with only minor glitches that don't affect in game play. Weaponry and bullet physics are great. Downside is vehicle physics are weird, as are flight physics, if you're following someone via parachute, you can end up waaay off course is they change direction. Finally, hackers. I know, I know. Its a tired old drum, but I'm not talking about 'lucky shots' here.  Scripts and macros are run by a lot of people, I'm talking about watching your death-cam or spectating after you've been killed, when you can see your opponent snapping between targets, aim-botting and locking on to head shots of people who aren't even visible, its clear that the hacks are real, they are in play and they are costing people games. You can hear the difference in the rate of fire when a weapon has a macro running on it. The reason people hack is because they have not developed the skills to be able to win without cheats. The allure of having an unfair edge over the competition is too tempting for the less mature gamers. Each time an update is made to try and catch the cheaters running background programs, the hacking scripts are updated and after a wave of ban reports, the hackers are back with a new F2P account (another huge mistake in my opinion) now there are no consequences to hacking at all.   I would recommend NOT playing the game. Go play something else where the developers actually care more about your game play experience than how many dance emotes you might be interested in buying..."

13453,"The best battle royal in my opinion. Although mid-game is a bit slow, early and late game show the game's best colors. The gun mechanics are far superior than other games like Apex or Warzone. Skill is key and all guns are viable in one capacity or another. Overall the game may be ""old"" but it's still popular and just as fun as ever."

13468,"Game is fun and all. A bit slow compared to H1z1/Z1 BR or fortnite. But mechanics is fine.
But the game has some major problems imo.
First off. The gas is way to slow and way to weak. People can literaly camp in the gas for like 3 zone and still out heal it and they can even see perfect in the gas. no thanks. way to noobish.

Second. There are way to many weapon and attactments imo. So confusing finding out which weapon are good or bad and so on. Should be like 1 or 2 scopes, a red dot and holo and then like 2 of each weapon max. AK, AR, SLR and Mini, pump and double barrel shotgun and so on... way easiere

And last but not least. The people in this camp are so trash and noobish. 90% of them at least. a bunch of campers in houses and bushes. i mean come on. IT'S A BR GAME. u are suppose to get kills. not wank for 20 min and win with 1 or 2 kills. grow some balls and play like a man instead of some scared kid.

but anyways. game is alright with friends. so 6/10"

This game is an embaressment, should have taken it behind a barn and shot it right between the eyes before coming out of beta."

There is a ranked mode but I have sat in that queue for 15+ minutes and never been placed in a game and its only for squad play (teams of 4). if they ever fix matchmaking so you're not placed in matches with people well beyond your skill level it can be a fun game however it seems the developer is more focused on skins, dances, and other ""candy"" than actually fixing any core issues surrounding the game which also includes crashes and other netcode related bugs."

13543,"It used to make fun when back in 2019 I played the game, now that I decided to give it a try again. It seems either way only smurfs or you are playing a game with bots. You run around and the ""players"" you see walk and behave weirdly. If you shoot at them they stand still. Feels like the game is dead and they try to fill up the game with bots. Furthermore, you just have the impression that you walk around 300h around and no one is insight. It just sucks then after spending so much time you just get shot at the very end, while having achieved nothing (did not meet any enemy players or anything). 
ALSO: WHY CAN I NOT CHOOSE THE MAP I WANT TO PLAY? ALL CLASSIC MAPS ARE TOO BIG AND IT DOESN'T MAKE FUN ANYMORE WALKING AROUND 09310238210381082301 hours just to be killed in the end while meeting no enemy players!!!

I have tried to explain them that it was working for 36 hours, so it is not for their game, they did not care.
ACtually they destroyed my experience with PUBG.
15 Years of gaming and  never got banned for anything.
I'll probably get a lawyer and ask them provide me data about me and why they call me a cheater."

13736,"Quick tip. If someone has 275 hours in a game, they most definitely do NOT need a tutorial. Why force a tutorial on someone who has PAID MONEY for the game. I took a break from playing due to the developers inability to please the players. I come back to a free to play nightmare filled with skins, paid cosmetics, and an unskippable tutorial. They have learned nothing from their mistakes and continue to ruin a great game. Try the game if you want now that it is free, but good luck getting through the hour long tutorial without uninstalling."

13739,"I used to love this game years ago. I loved watching all the streamers play this and all the funny moments they had. Unfortunately, the fun vibe is no longer there. First they removed open voice chat (to rest of lobby) until after the plane drop, and I feel like that was a wrong move. Then they started making competitive modes and honestly, I wish I could just go back to 2018 and relive this game, because the game was just so much more FUN back then. You can't even select maps anymore. Now, it's just somewhat boring like most ""competitive FPS"" games, or maybe I'm just getting old and tired of competitive games. Please bring back the old and fun PUBG."

Additional notes: This game is a battle royale, so take that as you will."
13749,I kinda liked the AI fighting but you can only do it like 10 times. The pvp annoys me. And unpopular opinion battle royale the most annoying game mode of any fps because of the long time before any action (if you even see any action) then you have a 50/50 (or worse if you're new) to die and do the whole wait over again. It's a game that favors those who are already good to continue to get better because they stay in game and get more practice. Not for me. Maybe if they allow Co-op/AI fights and have some way to unlock outfits without micro transactions.

13791,"There really isnt any BR quite like it. A little clunky and slower paced perhaps compared to others in the genre but what it lacks in speed it makes up for in being a methodical, calculating shooter that is as much game sense as it is general tactics and dexterity. 

You'll hate it. And then if you keep playing through the hate, eventually you realize you love it. F2P has also been a nice change up. Prior to, lobbies were very competitive and hardcore and it made for a lot of sucky times. Now, playerbase feels diverse, you don't see bots nearly as often, you aren't always getting drilled at a KM away by a dude with a DMR because he never stopped playing from the moment the game came out, its good times."

13809,"   IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO SHOW HOW STRONG WOMEN CAN BE. Thank you BlueHole, most new age game developers exclude supporting diversity from their games, unlike you. You not only put diversity on a pedestal, but you make it your primary battle as you plow through the cult-like fields of Toxic Masculinity. Thank you so much for also adding a ""report for being toxic"" Report selection.
   As a woman, i know what its like to constantly be cat called and verbally raped by toxic ugly fat men trolls on the internet. So i especially respect and adore you developers for ignoring the simple mechanical issues plaguing your buggy incomplete game, to focus on the important things, like me and my feelings.

I paid for this. Dropped the game after Taego released, since the devs kept taking away features like Duo/Squad and map selection.. The only reasonable argument was ""to reduce queue times"", but that was what quick join was for. PUBG becoming free to play was just confirmation that the game is being run down for easy money through microtransactions.

Might still be fun, but I cannot recommend it, knowing there are better battle royale games, even for free.

13971,"Complicated, complicated, complicated... I started playing it because auf the acclaimed ""realism"" of the game - which is just fassade. MGs that fire way too precisely with way too little kickback are just one issue. If somebody has RL experience with certain wepaons an calibers, nothing at all feels realistic here - just complicated to steer. Experiencing many players jump around leaning left and right and hitting me with headshots using full-auto-fire at the same time - where is the realsim in that?"

13990,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

I've learned a lot about battle royale by playing PUBG and in my opinion, it is super beginner friendly (I find the mechanics to be simple and easy to get accustomed to). Enjoy by yourself or with friends. Troll around or try to win the chicken dinner. Either way you'll have fun!"
14009,Republica socialistă Galați aprobă acest joc mă bucur că cei din Craiova au insfarsit un joc-documentar astfel toată lumea poate sa știe prin ce trece un craiovean zi de zi pentru a câștiga o cine de lux cu pui prăjit. Graficile foarte realiste astfel reflectandu-se ambientul din Craiova. Armele sunt destul de reprezentativa pentru orașul țării mele singurul lucru la care sunt contra este win94-le pentru că în Craiova nu se mai folosește acest tip de armă din 1989 după execuția lui Ceaușescu și se găsește mult prea des pe harta cu desert.

14026,"Intense gameplay & fun to play with friends (if you have em).
-
Playing this game makes you know about how greedy humans are, they loot everything they saw and they threw it whenever they doesn't need it anymore.
-
This game teaches us about human nature how human survive for their lives, they gonna do anything and everything for it even betraying other human including their own friends.
-
""oh c'mon bro it's just a game.....""
-
Recommended (y)."
14027,good
14028,   yes   free to play  but worth the upgrade
14029,"The Good:
- This is one of the ONLY BR games out there that still feels 'hardcore' to an extent. Recoil, healing, general basic movement, and the fact you can't hold dirty angles easily.
- Strategies ABSOLUTELY matter, something Apex and Fortnite have failed to replicate.
- No weapon rarity makes fights more fair.
- Audio. Gun sounds are clean, crisp, and each one most importantly, distinct.
- Every weapon is good in it's own way, and you aren't completely helpless if you are in the late game with say, only an AK and not an M4 or something, as long as you outplay your enemy.
- Airdrops are ACTUALLY worth going for.
- Devs still update the game (surprisingly), and balance changes help change up the game's meta. M4s AND M762s aren't king of ARs anymore!
- Still has it's own economy.
- Generally random players are reasonably mature and won't talk trash to you if you actually know what you're doing half the time.

The Bad:
- Holy f*cking sh*t... the AMOUNT of sweaty neckbeards in this game is not even funny. The amount of times I get crack-shotted in the head from a random location or from a roof by some level 500 with an anime character is ridiculous. This game does NOT have skill based matchmaking, and playing Ranked isn't possible without a verified phone, which is the only way to have access to a sort of skill based matchmaker.
- Cheaters. PUBG has had a cheating problem for a long time, just like any game that runs common anticheat such as Easy Anti-Cheat or BattlEye.
- Toxic community. I understand that while I played PUBG on Xbone (horrible experience, avoid), and only moved to the PC version of the game in 2021, the amount of ""git gud"" or ""ur trash"" a new player may face is a lot to take in. Still better than Fortnite's screaming 12-year-olds, but, guess I just have to play better against the sweaty neckbeards!
- No map select option, something that was removed sometime in 2020 I think, this makes playing maps that you don't like. (I don't like Miramar, too sniper-heavy, and I absolutely despise Haven, way too many angles to look out for, if you don't like my opinion, that's fine.)
- While most of the cosmetics aren't overpriced, most of them aren't that great.
- The only mode against bots (which you'd think would be good for practicing), is AWFUL, and you can only play it up to 10 times. AI also sucks in this game!

The Ugly:
- Minimal compensation for players like myself who bought the game originally before the F2P update. Seriously? 10 bucks worth of premium currency when I paid 30 bucks? Some weird short jacket and dress? Really, Bluehole?
- Game is run mostly by Tencent, who have scratched PlayerUnknown's legacy from this game like he was never even there.
- Plans to incorporate intrusive, kernel-level anticheat are underway.

To Sum it up:
Is PUBG still one of the best BR experiences out there? Yes. The heart-pounding feeling, the excitement when you loot good items, the adrenaline rush when near the end of a match, the thrill when you secure a win; no other BR captures this and for this reason is the one reason I am not striking this review as ""not recommended"". I don't play others due to them oversaturating the market, and PUBG's long-lost glory days have been tainted by neckbeards and sweats who play the game constantly and will shit talk you just because you barely missed most of your shots on them, as well as Tencent owning most of Bluehole, the original studio behind the game. They had so many chances to bring players back to the game, but with BR's oversaturation, failed.
It's still worth a go if it's your thing, have fun if it is. If you hate BRs and sweats, probably best to avoid this game like plague.
Final Rating: Mediocre. Final Score: 6.0 out of 10."
14030,"I understand the negative reviews early on in this game, but ever since this game went to F2P I feel like it has greatly improved and its really fun now. Also I have never ran into hackers and the game has a lot of content now and its free so people should definately try it out."
14031,rqrwrtfewfsfsefsf
14032,"The game is really hard for newbies. There isin't skill based matchmaking or even level based matchmaking so you're either going to go nuts in a bot lobby or die from a 500Lv player with the death by a hacker somewhere in between. 

Gun recoil is extremely hard to control and everything in this game seems to be obtuse in general, from the way you have to click and not hold RMB to ADS, the guns by default not being loaded and set to semi auto, even calling in an airdrop with a flair is confusing as hell(ok this one is on me for being kind of dumb). 

BUT if you put the time and effort of learning some of the mechanics, recoils, ect.. its a game with a lot of challenge and excitement as well as gratification of knowing you earned that chicken dinner! 

Still amazing all these years later and its FREE! Just be ready."

14107,"It's free and I still would like compensation for playing this game.

-Requires you to install about 40 anti-cheats when you first launch
-""Tutorial"" takes over a fucking hour and a half
-Team Deathmatch doesn't function at all
-Queue 3 minutes to get into lobby, then wait over a minute in the pre-game lobby thing
-Finally get into match
-Run around empty map grabbing randomly AI placed weapons/items
-Most effective strat is to wait in buildings and do nothing
-The 3rd person run animation is so painfully bad that I just stay in 1st person
-Weapons look like stock assets
-15 minutes later get 1 shot by a guy you couldn't possibly see unless you have a 12K monitor
-Then you get kicked to a loading screen that the game has about a 40% chance of freezing on
-Start the process over again if you want another match.

And chinese people apparently still think this game is the best fucking thing in the world next to earning social credit points? It baffles me how this is one of the most played games on steam. Imagine being one of the suckers that bought this before it was free. lmao"
14108,"i just started the game and honestly i am getting players of level 200, 300,500. Like i just started the game, the recoil is very bad and cannot be controlled at all."

14116,"Miramar needs to not have a 20x multiplier on the random map option, it makes 0 sense to remove the option to not choose or remove maps from the pool, it has been like this for years and they fail to realize noone wants to play Miramar, it is complete fucking dogshit and everyone has been over it for 5 years. Random Map selector??? More like MIramar 5 times in a row. AND BOY OH BOY DO I LOVE THE LACK OF SKILL BASED MATCH MAKING SO I CAN GO AGAINST LEVEL 500 NO LIVES WITH THOUSANDS OF MEDALS. Please stop matchmaking me with these fucking losers that play this game like they are trying to qualify for pro league. If you play this game for fun you are in for a rude awakening, this game is for hardened killers and true MLG pros. No fun allowed, camp in a building like a little twink for the entire match to win. Imagine saying that you lowered a map pick rate to match the rest of the maps. Just to still queue people for the same fucking map 7 times in a fucking row with no variation. LEARN HOW TO CODE SIMPLE NUMBERS YOU DUMB FUCKING MORONS. If you work on this game or under this company, you are unforgivably fucking stupid and god will not allow you to inherit the kingdom of heaven."

Then you're forced to play random garbage maps or queue jump for hours until getting the 1 you want. Which you get to wait to play for 15m because the game start clock forces a full match. Everything that was once fun about this game is gone. And it's still riddled with cheaters.

Lots of really poor bullet collision issues (firing past/through rocks or trees and your bullets being eaten by collision), the movement and weapon handling mechanics are slow and janky, the inventory system remains clunky. When I compare this to what I see of APEX (world class) Warzone (solid) Fortnite (meh, but usability is solid), this one just fails on almost all fronts. I cannot bring myself to recommend PUBG to anyone in 2022."

Existem muitos criadores de pato no Pará, alguns apuram a raça a partir de vários cruzamentos, inclusive com patos selvagens, a carne é escura e firme preparado com vários temperos, o pato é assado cortado em pedaços e mergulhado no tucupi, um caldo amarelo extraído da mandioca, o último toque vem do jambu, planta picante que provoca ligeira dormência na boca e que faz parte de muitas receitas da cozinha paraense"

14158,"Despite the hackers that plague this game, it is still the best Battle Royale game I've seen. Perhaps the developers should consider adding an all-bots game mode (1vs99 AI) with varying difficulty modes until they manage to get the cheating under control."
14159,good
14160,Dogshit.
14161,really good game but the training mode i fucking hate it take it out pubg developers i get that you guys just want people to get the game and know how to play it but come on take it out for the love of god

14174,Hello sexy banana veryyy goood veryyyy nicee
14175,games filled with toxic players from china and india and stuff but yk kinda expected
14176,"If you're new to the game, you will be greeted with a terrible tutorial where you need to play the game with bots and everything is limited (you can't play with your friends being one of them) during this ""tutorial"". 

70% of the game is just running and running and expecting something to happened. Or maybe i never played this game during it's launch and probably this game's pace is too slow for me to see the magic.

My point is this game is just the most basic battle royale game. Which is make sense, since this is the ""first"" of it's kind. Just play Apex or just fortnite. At least being good in those games actually mean something."

14192,"Zero MMR in both casual and random game modes. lvl 300-500 players with 1000+ hours in matches with lvl 1-50 player. Needs proper tiered match making system so that new players don't get obliterated in every single match.  It is like the game is called ""basketball"" and the 6 yr old pee-wee league kids are thrown in the same match with several Kobe Bryants, Lebron James, and Michael Jordans. New players don't stand a chance and it is an incredible hindrance towards population growth.

Inb4 ""get gud"" -- ALLOW ME TO GET GOOD.  Max level players kill me so quickly that I don't even have time to figure out what my mistakes were.  I've died to a level 50-ish player twice and they were super fun and exciting fire fights! I saw where I messed up and learned from the situations. But that is 2 deaths out of 100.  The other 98 were long distance snipes or ambush/sneak attack - no time to react or learn anything.

Sure, watch the Youtube guides on how to play.  They're full of tips and tricks. Common tactics, pros and cons of this and that. Optimal gun set ups, gear and armor priorities. Pump ALL of that knowledge straight into you brain and STILL not have anywhere the needed amount of skill to overcome the veteran players. You just become a delivery system that brings optimized set ups, gear, attachments, etc directly to the guy who has won 100x more Chicken Dinners than matches you've played.

It is a hard skill ceiling that the veteran player base brings all the way down to the ground by standing on it. It is like taking Economics 101 and the prof slaps you in the face with the final exam for Economics 401."

14311,"I keep losing everyone MUST be CHEATERS!!!! I don't understand I've gone 13-4 in a CoD lobby once I don't understand why I don't win every match, everyone must be a hax0r. This games skill comes down to gun control, this isn't Apex or CoD. Adjust and run it back, you'll notice much less cheaters once you practice ;) (tons of sweats though screw those guys /s)

Real tips though the game is dependent on sound so listen, if someone was holding an angle it might not be wall hacks you might just be sprinting around like a 280lbs linebacker.
Comms are key, if you're playing with a squad let your team know the plan, who's holding and who's pushing you'll win a lot more engagements.
Knowledge is power, knowing what loot is where and what to grab, where the plane path was so you can tell where people will likely push from, where people are likely to drop, which buildings people are going to loot and which rooms and angles they'll hold if you're pushing them will make you so much better. Remember this knowledge comes with time you aren't going to know everything sub 200hrs. People making 'sus' plays against you are because they've encountered that exact scenario 50+ times :)
Lastly just practice your gun control. 

GLHF out there gamers!!"

Though, after finding a game and dying either within 10 seconds or after 20+ minutes of looting from a sniper or full auto AK from 3 miles away its soul destroying. Also, the fact you cannot choose a map is mad. I think I'll be uninstalling PUBG for the last time."

14401,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

When you have a company that cares more about selling in game cosmetics, rather than focusing on the core mechanics and evolving to stay relevant/engaging, you end up with this pile of sh*t.

In solo, you get knocked you die, in squad you get knocked, your squad can get you up. 

Only sweaty tryhards (Its fine to be a sweaty tryhard, it means your'e very good at the game, and really I'm just jealous I'm not at good as you so only thing I can do is call you a sweaty tryhard) play solo so if your'e gonna play get some friends who to play with."

14733,Krafton should work on to increase player counts. Make a good tutorial for new players. TDM is the only mode i enjoy in this game. This game was know for its Battleroyale and now its boring for new players.
14734,Very fun game! Basically fortnite but realistic and 10x the fun!
14735,Unoptimised awful excuse for a game. The fact that it used to be a paid game concerns me.

14744,Too many china hackers. From I like to greatly detest. Dev ain't able to do anything about it. Might as well wait for Super People else you can just enter the game and in less than 5 mins get shot by a guy shooting at the sky while you are having a hike in the mountains or looting a house.

14759,"I don't know if It is broken, or if this is a case where it expects me to do something I am not sure what is asking.
in 20 years of gaming. This is the only time I have gotten stuck in the tutorial."
14760,"It's free now so what can you say. I've been a huge fan of PUBG from the beginning. This is the first time I've played the PC release. BattleEye is apparently a joke. 
Users can still inject ESP and aimbots without getting automatically kicked. Some are more obvious than others, they'll run up out of nowhere and just start shooting right dead center at you're cover and then as soon as you pop out hit you with their aimbot head shot. Some are slightly less obvious, They'll run from out of nowhere with their cursor fixated on your exact location. 
I've been killed by someone who is extremely suspicious in every match I've played. That's not a good look.
One match even had an apparent speed hacker. Couldn't see the user id so no way to report it.

As someone who has been playing FPS games for years on PC and console, the forced tutorial and AI only matches in the beginning we're quite annoying. Just let me play the damn game.

It's free. You're not out anything if you play it but if it wasn't free, this would be a solid do not recommend just because of the frequency of hacking. My guess is, the developers couldn't get a handle on the hacking and decided to make it free because what are you gonna say? You didn't pay for it. I'm just glad I didn't invest in the cosmetic accessories."
14761,cant even take two steps forward without getting sniped in the head. cheaters abound in this game. boring af
14762,first game i used a 12 gauge and i got 5 kills by running behind somebody popping their skull then move to their teamate

14768,"doesnt let you play the game untill you finish the tutorial, and theres 15 steps till you finish it. i just wanted to play the game not a tutorial. or does anyone know how to skip the damn thing."
14769,I've played almost 300 hours in this game and as of some recent update i have to go through some training mode to learn how to play the game in order to play it. Why tf would the devs think i need to learn how to play a game I have this much time into
14770,"why would you make a non optional tutorial that requires 10 full ai matches played? you have to commit hours to the game to even start it? BATTLE ROYALE has infested every game you could possibly play, everyone knows how to play a BR at this point,what a terrible decision. ill just go play any of the 1000 other free BR's that don't force me to play their way"

14823,:)
14824,"welp for 2022 its....okay i guess in someways, but the negative out ways the good, NA servers are slammed with peeps from over seas cheating and griefing and team killing etc, the pass only goes up to 70 , dont think ive ever seen a pass not be atleast 100, kinda feel a bit ripped off, cosmetics are nothing but lame vanity items that make you stick out like a neon sign, not good when your trying to kill peeps, o yeah so useful. events are pretty lame , rewards in this game even with plus is pretty lack luster , worst rewards ive ever seen for a game. idk almost feels like the only reason to play it would be to get steam achievements, last update was like 30ish gigs and was 99.9999999% cosmetics, barley and game improvements, threads are trolled by fanni bois who troll and harass people and mods barley ever do anything, over all its one of those games you try for awhile, then dump. game could be better but sadly its just going to turn out to be a mine for krafton to try and put out a better title, for 2022 for a fsp shooter its actually lacking in so many departments.

UPDATE !!!

well after getting a death threat, and getting ddossd, even after buying season pass left the game, too many people from overseas griefing NA servers, too many team killers, too many cheaters that dont even hide their hacks.

DO NOT GIVE THIS COMPANY MONEY, they care more about profit then anything else, person who made death threat is still playing, they were giving all the details and person still plays, i have zero respect who allows someone to make death threats still play, pathetic."

14835,"I genuinely wish I could say yes, but I cannot until they properly address the hacking issue.

50% of my matches are met with someone's aim suddenly snapping to my player, a very obvious and dreaded encounter with an aim bot. Whether it's from across the map or through the wall, they'll find a way to ruin even a newbie's best play.

I will continue to play this game, as it is a great game beyond the people who decide to continue to exploit the game's vulnerabilities, but until the hacking is stopped or greatly reduced, I will not recommend this very addictive title.

Edit: The hacker situation has somehow gotten even worse within a few weeks time. It's on the verge of not being worth playing any longer, it's basically avoiding hackers for as long as possible until you inevitably get wiped out by someone's hack."
14836,i love this game
14837,"To make this game as fun as i remember it at least 3 things need to be changed
1. The leaning motion does not effect ones accuracy, encouraging absolutely absurd Q/E spamming in a firefight. (R6 fixed this at some point if im not wrong)
2. Add map selection, possibly making it somewhat similar to cs:go. I'd rather spend 10mins in a queue for Vikendi, Sanhok or Paramo than play a single match of Miramar
3. Whole matchmaking system actually, remove ranked completely, all matches should be skill-based. And instead of being based on pubg level, base the matchmaking on k/d ratio

Hold up, i think 2 of these might have been actual features in the game at some point..."

PUBG is another game that got actively worse as the developer/studio got more involved. When it was just Erangel this game was one of the greatest fun times to be had. Now its a pathetic joke of a game because the people in charge of it are terrible at their jobs.

So broken.......broken and cheated....just the way I feel after thousands of wasted hours on a broken and cheated game. Run scared and never look back.

I'll be waiting for someone in the industry to actually complete a game before releasing it, and who takes a ZERO TOLERANCE approach to cheating before I waste any more of my time or money on ANY video game. Yes, I realize that day will probably never come, but we can hope! In the mean time, I'm off to find a new hobby. Maybe when the devs start to worry about how to pay their mortgage or buy groceries they'll care more about the integrity of their work and the quality of the experience for their customers...maybe."

14984,I used to enjoy this game.  It is now completely impossible to play.  I am going to uninstall and will consider returning when the company decides to care about the players.  Do something about the cheaters.  I have to report cheating almost every game now.

14998,"Well after having this game purchased for me a while ago and playing a good 40 hours i wasnt too impressed with the stability of the game,  That being the main issues years ago.

Upon returning to the game, excited to try it out again, disapointed that it was free to play now which i feel spits in the face of any person that payed for the game. Also upon installing and starting the game again, files corrupted and game crashed which i feel is a bad indications for how this with continue.  Maybe it will change my mind if it works.

However at the moment.

Mind is not changed, managed to get to load game, forced into training which is frustrating.
Game crashes once im playing Ai Training match...

Game still a disapointment for me."

15001,"Good game. But it NEEDS CROSS-PLAY with CONSOLE. there would be an unfair advantage but an this point point of the game no one would care. 1. It would fill lobbies with actual player. 2. People would be able to play with friends. 3. No one plays this to be sweaty anymore, its for casual gaming now. 4. It would expand player base from the soul purpose of cross-play, just like how y'all made it free. Please add it already."

It was horrible before, but it's even more horrible now. Cheaters everywhere. I think I've played enough of pubg. I've had my absolute last games tonight, where my squad (irl friends) all died to cheaters that snapped to target.
For me, it's R.I.P. PUBG. I CANNOT recommend this game at its current state.
It's, quite literally, poop.

15094,"good shooter, always a different game every time i PLAY."
15095,"So I came back to this after a 2 and a half year Hiatus. 

This game was good a good long time ago. 
Map selection still needs to come back. There has been instances where I get the same map (Usually mirimar or karakin) close to 3-4 or even 5 times in a row. I understand that it could exist because they don't want some maps being left out but this is not the way to do it. 
The matchmaking that used to exist in the form of getting ranks from regular matches was swapped out for a money grab subscription which now means I as someone who is not even level 100 yet and I go against people that far outmatch me almost every match. This mostly occurs in the form of level 500s who have significantly more coordination, game sense, aim, recoil control etc. 
The anti-cheat is ok at best. Here and there I come across somewhat frequent cheaters. Usually in the form of people using aimbots or walls.

I will give this game the benefit of the doubt in the sense that it's mostly fun to play with friends. There is always some meme strats or stupid shit you can pull to make the game enjoyable. 
Flare guns have a bit more rarity which is pretty nice. It makes it a bit more rewarding to find them as compared to when I last played I could find up to 4 in a match sometimes.

15107,"i am gay
"
15108,The majority of people who play this game have sunk an ungodly amount of time into it to the point that it is extremely difficult to play without getting absolutely smashed out the gate. Now you may be able to dedicate  thousands of hours and get good or you can hide until the end of the game and try to make some lucky shots but the reality is I and most people don't want to take up a part time job playing a game so that we can start to have some fun. I have put a decent number of hours in and have come to the conclusion it is not worth my time. Play a game that respects your time and you can enjoy rather than beating you head against this wall.
15109,good
15110,Battle Royale go BRRRRRRRRRRR
15111,fun and fair game
15112,There's a common theme in this games continued development and that theme is negligence.
15113,"After 50 hours I have to say, This game sucks..

The game itself is actually amazing and the concepts are fun and inviting.   The matchmaking process is all fine and dandy, but good luck finding groups that are willing to work together.   Also it being free to play and on a bunch of platforms it's like pulling teeth to get people with any amount of skill.   Not to mention the crazy amount of people that cheat playing this game.  

I love the game itself, its only slightly glitchy.   Crashes more than I would like as well..  but if you are looking for a fun game that doesn't really require buy to win and can deal with the issues that come with it.  Then this may be the game for you."
15114,bruh that training is str8 ass doesnt even register fix ur old game bro
15115,"As I approach almost 900 hours in this game, It definitely had it's issues with Cheaters/Hackers prior to being released as a free to play, but now I swear it's every game. Not only is the reporting system useless as it doesn't tell you if any action has been taken but who cares? Someone gets banned they make a new account so forth. It's not even fun anymore, There are many other games like this that are far more polished and far better off than this game has been and is going too."
15116,The game is really fun to play with your friends. Whenever I get some free time I enjoy fighting people. The game is very realistic and I highly recommend it.

The maps are interesting though, the backgrounds are interesting and nicely positioned. Vehicles are ok, and gunplay is fine.

Not to mention I logged in and come to find out I was banned for absolutely no reason, perm ban too! But you see people cheating left an right with no bans. Even with reporting plenty of people every single time the cheaters only got a temporary ban but for someone who doesnt cheat and spent hours actually playing the game the right way I get banned for life with no chance of appeal or even a chance to talk to anyone. Any response from these people is automated. The Shield system to help with the cheaters is garbage. The cosmetics in this game are overpriced and they all look ridiculous.

15257,I would not recommend this to friend at all due to the fact if you are a new player you get pinned against people that are max level at 500 whilst you yourself are a level 1 I guess this company never heard of skilled based match making and when people get reported for cheating nothing get's done about it. That is all thank you for your time.

15260,"Cheaters Paradise!!

You can report players that are obviously cheating, but if you get  an answer on one of those reports it just says: Thank you for keeping pubg a clean place! We locked player X out of the game FOR THREE DAYS ... LOL?
But then he can go on cheating as before or what? 
Many no recoilers, wallhackers, aimbotters... And I don't mean the good players! I can tell a difference! 
I start to hate the game. I keep trying to play and be good and smart, then some lucky cheaterkid comes and headshots you out of nowhere and you can start over again, collect all your loot..... But why do I keep playing then?
It's got a very nice gameplay, most realistic details on the maps.. but don't get lost in details... always focus on sounds, the next corner... the next cheater--- Or even very good players playing together with noobs.. makes it really hard to find a good start. And I did use the training map a lot. I am a very good COD2 player, but I still cannot transfer my skills into this game. The moving (fast sideways moves just don't reall work here) is so different.. I still give it 2 out of 5 stars. But it is really hard to have fun. and that stress is not worth it. I will uninstall soon. At least i think i will xD

Also, it runs REALLY poorly sometimes for absolutely no reason... I've got a GTX1080, a high-end CPU and a lot of RAM, but it still runs like a grandma who's got Parkinson. You know, slowly and jitterily :'(

15325,"On 03/29/2022, at approximately 1952 hours, I decided to type a review for PUBG: Battlegrounds. 

It seems every time I login in I observe several messages stating that the players I reported for cheating  from pass games had been banned. Yes, you may be thinking, wait that is a good thing that they are actually reviewing reports but the fact is players are able to continue to cheat and win games from you, and it ruins the experience.  

Normally, I would continued to get into a match with a friend. We would  win a chicken dinner, and would feel like the game had improved. Thinking it had possibly less cheaters. Boy would we be wrong. Next matches that would follow would have several suspicious deaths, and some top 10's. I'd say at least every three games you would find out cheaters killed you while spectating. You will observe them either using radar or ESP. Some will even be so bold that they will aimbot instant headshots. You will report them and wake up the next day seeing they were banned and repeat the above.

Normally I'm able to met okay teammates that are willing to work  together even if the team doesn't  all speak the same language (which seems to also happen every three rounds).  Oh and some reason they always want to update or do maintenance right when everyone with 9-5 jobs get home and settled in. 

Oh they also have bots that randomly shoot and wear dino outfits majority of the time and shoot randomly sometimes hitting you which ""YAY"" free kill but it makes it feel like the game is dying which it maybe is.  

Got my hours worth but games will always get a not recommend if hackers are blatant. Only reason I continue to play the game is because BATTLEFIELD 2042 SUCKS ***** and steam won't give me a refund."

15401,"TL;DR:If you're a noob, don't bother, if you wanna play with less than 4 people, don't bother either. 
Quite obvious, I know, but the free to play managed to get me. Why not try it, right? It's fun in the beginning, but quickly gets frustrating and then stale (again, for noobs). Also, the cheating all the negative reviews speak of maybe only seems to be not THAT much, but is instead just not very obvious. Dunno. 
It's definitely there, tho, even for me to notice.  
Still fun, not everyone's a noob with only one Steam friend playing this game and ffs it's free after all.




As most free to play games PUBG is geared towards making noobs feel like they could actually keep up with it, and it's very good at that, putting you through a phase where you have to play against AI players only, which is passed off as a tutorial, but really just serves to make the game feel rewarding to new players by constant success, and give them the impression they could actually compete, to draw them in. 
This is continued in the 3 ""casual"" matches per day you get to keep you hooked by feeling like you have a chance. Here, you play against AI with 11 other human players, the other 88 being bots, very easy bots. 

With constant level-ups and pseudo rewards (any [i]actual[/i] goodies are safely stored behind a paywall, of course), the game gives you an impression of making progress, all the while feeling rather easy in the beginning. The more you level up tho, the more you get thrown into matches with actual fps players who will simply pick you apart. 
In this, choosing your landing place keeps up the illusion of having a chance, making your own luck anyway. After all, you can just land somewhere quiet, get some gear together and sneak towards the safe zone, theoretically. In practice, you can either land where there's good gear to loot or somewhere where there isn't a team of experienced players waiting for you. If you find yourself to be alone in a place, expect to find crappy guns and gear - if any. If you land and find level 3 gear, you're probably surrounded by footsteps already. 

Since you level up automatically and had your stats boosted by those first 10h of the game being so easy, you can safely assume to be dead within the next minute, then, if you somehow managed to still be a noob while being at a level the matchmaking puts you with experienced (or at least ""successful) players. 

Unfortunately, even if you managed to get any better chances are it'll be still pretty much the same once other players get near you...
While I only encountered one or two obvious cheaters so far (deathcam showing their sights snapping onto me from a 3/4 screen away, without moving across the space inbetween), I constantly get found (obviously I'm hiding and camping a lot like a noob does) by people who, watching the deathcam where actually busy with something/someone else or obviously just passing by, at medium distance before suddenly deciding to change direction to exactly the house I'm in, ignoring all the other buildings they could loot.
Sure, many people in this game just have good instincts from years and years of playing fps games and incredible reflexes from being 11, as opposed to me old fool. 

But then there's dudes like the one in a recent match, sneaking along a street actually trying to find the people he's just been in a firefight with, only to suddenly begin aiming at my exact position inside the building, behind the windowless wall he was only about to pass a second before, without him having a sightline or myself making any noise, and he manouvers through several rooms and around walls through which he's constantly keeping my position in his crosshairs before seeing and shooting me the millisecond I'm [i]actually[/i] visible, without having to aim any further - and you can report those dudes all you want, I suspect, because it's still not unmistakable enough like snapping to targets or actually [i]shooting[/i] me through the wall. 
And cheaters aren't usually as obvious as the doofus described here, so most of the time you're in doubt whether it WAS just you ending up in a room, in a corner that, to a normal player, is super obvious to specifically go and check - even though, of course, most of the time it is exactly that, and once in deathcam you realize how you dug your own grave basically. 

So far, I haven't found the game as infested with cheaters as the reviews made me think (which is why I never bought the game before ftp), but then again, I really am a noob, so who knows what I miss. 


Still, I recommend this game. For a free to play game, those first few hours in it definitely were a LOT of fun for a noob a LOT more than for example Warzone, and in the 2 out of 10 occasions where you actually get a good PUG team, it can be awesome rewarding gameplay. 
Cheaters aside, it must be mad fun when you're actually any good at fps games and happen to have some friends that are as well.

15405,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

15435,.
15436,"I will preface this by saying that I play PUBG on multiple platforms, and I recognize my 35 minutes of Steam-recorded playtime may lend to readers doubting my review. But again, I play on multiple platforms and have hundreds of hours. 

I have a list of multiple complaints about this game in light of my recent Steam experience, but also overall.

1) The game is not optimized graphically nor for your CPU. The graphics are terrible and it still finds a way to run chunkily.

2) When playing for the first time, it makes you play the tutorial, which is buggy and can force you to restart. My 35 minutes is entirely in the tutorial for my Steam account. Additionally, you have to play TEN-- TEN!!! -- entire Bot games before you unlock the actual playable modes. I was just trying to play some PUBG with my girlfriend, when we discovered we would have to play both the tutorial AND THEN TEN fake matches before we could even play one with each other.

3) The controls are just shitty. Shitty controls. Whether custom or default. Notably, I play on controller, even when I play PC. But that's no excuse, as Apex, Call of Duty, heck even Fortnite, have all figured out how to integrate controller players with nice controls. PUBG's are garbage. You have to hold buttons you normally would press, and press buttons you would normally hold (you can only rebind by choosing from a list of preset control options). Don't even get me started on 1st versus 3rd person ADS. Terrible controls. 

I could make other complaints, about cheaters, or unbalanced gameplay. But for the sake of brevity, let me just say that this game will have just about the same issues as any other game, except to a higher degree. If you're looking for a free battle royale, Apex, Fortnite, and Call of Duty are far better options. The fact that this game is so horrendous when it's been around for so long is inexcusable."

the game does play really well most of the time and seems to have a good method of reporting cheaters

Few things that I think need to be changed and fixed
1 Random game crashing closing to desktop, this happens quite alot and ive seen it with many people
2 There should be a set time for the first starting circle, soem times you land and you have like 30 seconds to move to next circle and it can be the other side of the map and other times you have 5 minutes to the next comes.

if they have any archives of the old versions of the game lying around and decided to create something akin to the test server except for the early access version that would be really cool and would probably help in reviving the love for the game"
15589,"I waited to play for at least 1000 hours before reviewing this game. By far, this game is an amazing experience. It's not perfect and it requires tons of patience and commitment to be a good player, but it's fun and can be rewarding. I recommend this to anyone looking for a realistic Battle Royale experience, who is willing to put in the necessary time and effort to improve at the game. I do not recommend this to a casual gamer or to someone who lacks patience."

To make casual sunday players even more angrier game tells you must ""complete basic training"" and on top of that also ""complete all AI training drills or play 10 AI matches"".

I haven't come across as many hackers as people say, at least not in NA. Some people are just really good since they've been playing since 2018. If you want to get started now and get mechanically fluid quickly, spend some time in training mode to get a feel for the guns and other gear. You can spend 20 minutes shooting more rounds than you would in 20 matches."

15652,"To call this game garbage would be insulting to garbage itself. PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS has more issues than all battle royales combined since this genre spawned.

Starting with the performance issues it occasionally lags and crashes even on a high end PC. Especially if you enable DX12. The matchmaking is abysmal. Imagine you just ran your first match at lvl 10? (supposedly after tutorial and bot games) and you get stomped by a lvl 500. You are like: ""It's fine. It just one game."" But it is not as this will happen again and again and again and again and the game will put you against players which are way above your skill level and it doesn't give a damn about it. The game treats the free players like disposable trash. You want outfits. Pay. You want skins. Pay. You want to get event rewards. Pay. Otherwise you are subjected to buy boxes from the store ""cough"" gambling ""cough"" and get the same dirty T-shirt for the tenth time because why not? The game is also full of cheaters. I've been killed through walls god knows how many times and people (the hackers) are not even trying to hide it. You can report them. They will get banned, but absolutely nothing stops them to make a new account and ruin someone's game again. In the end I can say that you will have fun with literally every other game in existence (even Goat Simulator) and your time will be well spent whereas every hour spent in PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS feels wasted away."
15653,Pubg mobile
15654,"I'm not saying that it's a game that you play to enjoy, all I'm saying is, you get on the game to feel something when life is weighing you down and you're struggling to feel ANYTHING. So PUBG is there so you can feel insurmountable rage."

15659,i have played this on mobile since it was released and love it but on pc not so much. what the hek is up with not allowing us to  choose maps and the lag in game is atrocious. i got shot by an sks but all the shots came in as though it was from a p90. i have only been able to get 1 kill in all the time that i have played the game. i love the mobile version but i think that thats where it should stay

15667,"i played pubg when it started liked it stopped due to issues bck in 2017 to 2019 played it recently i definitely recommend it again i like the gunfight and the movement its refreshing again after so much apex and shit war zone i like the more military approach from pubg so the question is up to you would you play pubg again
 in 2022 me yes <3 


pro
more realistc gunplay as far as game's are considert
customization for guns 
vaulting
cars 
maps are decent dont like them all but there good 



cons 
movement can be a bit tricky sometimes but its okey  
recoil is hard compaird to apex or warzone but ones you played some tdm and trained a bit its nice just cause its hard doesnt mean it sucks


the game is not for everyone i get it but if u want a more ""realistc aproach"" its still a game chill
if its not for u move on there then enough shit battleroyals  like warzone or apex go there then if u play fortnight go suck a big pp"

15671,"I had a ""good"" time playing the real deal (I played PUBG Mobile and Lite), but everything comes to an end. I just don't really want to spend hundreds of hours just to get good. The thing is, I am already bored playing this game even tho I have less than 30 hours. I always tried to land on spots where a lot of players are dropping, but half of thoose were always bots, and it's just not fun. Also tried playing Deathmatch but that thing is filled with tryharders and I always left the match. 

For me this game is the most boring sh*t I've ever played. I don't even want to try to get all the achievements, it's just not worth the effort and time."

15700,"I had never tried this game before it was released free-to-play. It's an excellent game if you have at least one friend to play it with - but frustrating as a solo. The two of us play on squad mode, and even when we're paired up with 2 randos to make a 4-person team, it's not a big deal if the two halves of your team split up and tackle different sides of the map. I also prefer to mute the in-game chat and just use Discord to coordinate with my one friend.

The learning curve can be a little steep, but Casual Mode is a great place to get a feel for the flow of the game, and which weapons click with you. I do wish there was more of a tutorial for learning how to use sniper scopes effectively, as that seems to be an important skill. Also the tutorial that does exist caused me to get stuck, as there is not enough of a distinction made by the in-game text between the two DIFFERENT forms of aiming a weapon... click RMB to use your weapon's sights/scope. Hold RMB to just steady your weapon in your hands.

The cosmetics are largely behind paywalls, but you can still get some randomized items with free in-game currency that you receive while playing, and a bit of patience. Enough to make you look visually distinct from someone just starting out, anyway."

15748,good!
15749,"Fuck this game
"
15750,For so many reasons I recommend staying away from this game.
15751,"As the game that ""began"" the Battle Royale genre properly it's got a lot going for it. The gunplay is unmatched in any other game. Gun recoil mechanics let you know it's not going to sugarcoat the game in any way. But that is really all the game has going for it after 5 years of release.

The servers have struggled over the years with Developer introduced limitations on map selection, mode selection all to try and funnel the few remaining players into smaller queue pools. Then they added NPC bots to the game to try and fluff the player count. This is not as horrible as people can make it out to be.

Over the years the Developers have implemented a metric boatload of patches, content releases and updates to the game. They've added over half a dozen maps (most hated by the general playerbase in one form or another) and now have started rotating maps in and out with random updates.

The problem with PUBG and the Developers is that everything they do they are doing far too late. In the early days of the game the playerbase cried out for a new map as having the one map was wearing thin. The Developers obliged, but only after half their playerbase had jumped ship to Fortnite. The playerbase wanted a Console release, which did eventually make it's way out albeit with absolutely no crossplay. Something the game sorely needs. More maps were released, removed, revamped, renovated, revamped again, tweaked and tinkered with, however the majority of players prefer the original 2 larger maps and will regularly leave lobbies.

Fast forward 5 years and the game in a struggling dying breath finally did something that should have been done in the first year of release, and went Free to Play. This has seen an influx of people who didn't want to shell out money for what is essentially a dead game, come in for the first time. These players face off against the hardcore elite, the people who haven't abandoned the game. This unfortunately means that the vast majority of these new players come in, play for a week and leave. The queues remain mostly dead outside of peak playing times, which when you cast your mind back to Early access is crazy. In early access there was no such thing as peak times. You fired up the game and you got a 80+ lobby. Instantly.

The Developers are seeking to bring this back so they can relive their glory days of rolling in the $$. This unfortunately is the core goal of the developers. They introduce skins very slowly, of questionable quality (reversed wording, out of focus etc) at a significant premium. In an effort to ensure that they capture as much money from their players as possible they introduced a purchasable currency (to be fair Fortnite has had this for a while also) and then price items so you're always needing to get large packs to cover them. It made more sense to just pay real world money for the skins.

And lastly we arrive at the latest cash grab. The gamble that is Upgradeable Weapon Skins. These rare (less than 1% chance to receive) come from purchasable crates in the Hideout. Each crate costs 200 GCoin, or $2USD. To upgrade these skins you need a significant amount of resources, some of which are only rarely obtained from the same purchasable crates. There are many videos on YouTube explaining your chances of obtaining and upgrading one of these with the maths pointing to upwards of $1000 with a small amount of luck.

The fact that the Developers are allowed to offer these services, to a playerbase that can be as young as the registration age for Steam (13) is questionable. Nevermind that gambling services in many countries of the world require registration and licensing.

Another nail in the PUBG coffin is the proliferation of cheating/hacking within the game. This stems from a cultural need to always be the best but also the prize pools often on offer for the various PUBG tournaments that still take place year round. These tournaments are often operated online, meaning the various teams have no oversight on their local PC's. This ensures that, at least while online games take place, there will be a significant portion of ""professionals"" who will utilise some form of software to gain an advantage to secure funds. That these same ""professionals"" then struggle when competing in offline/arena environments has been well observed.

PUBG sought to combat this by adding in-game reporting. However this too has issues with the new influx of players reporting anyone who kills them, resulting in unwarranted bans being handed out by the Developers automated system. It has been observed that 3 people reporting the same player from a single game is enough to implement an automated 24hr ban. The Developers should have a limitation on this automated system whereby a player is required to at least have completed 100hrs within the game to be a reputable source on whether a combatant is playing outside of the scope of the game. Rather than having no experience and then being able to make a significant call. You wouldn't let your first year medical student perform open-heart surgery and neither should someone with no experience carry the ability to significantly impact another players gaming experience.

As a final thought the game does have the ability to stand out in an ever-growing field of shooting games however the Developers will need to take drastic steps to forego the direction they have been going (towards the $) and return to the core intent of the game. Focus on the gameplay mechanic. Remove the irritants that have plagued the game for 5+ years (redzone, lack of a revive mechanic, BP reward, lack of tangible reward for winning a match, and many more) and bring the game back into the front of the Battle Royale genre where it should truly belong. They don't have much time. Super People, a game with the gunplay of PUBG, an actual revive mechanic coupled with the new idea of crafting to improve weapons/armour is slated for release in only a few months."

15790,What in gods name happened to this game.
15791,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."
15792,"game is still very poorly optimized, mantle times are way too long, make sure you have someone watching your back when you do. there are other F2P games out that perform and run better than this, but this is free so f it i guess"
15793,"would highly recommend this game to everyone as there is no game in comparison in the genre and has really good physics and realism, the only problem is that the game highly un-optimised and would require a high end CPU to run smoothly at 120+ FPS and also never forget that hackers exist in all the multiplayer games."

I reinstalled it again after a few years and quickly uninstalled after a few hours of playing.

15818,Still good
15819,Fun to play
15820,"fun gunplay, interesting maps, the bot problem goes away after you hit lvl 50 or so (approx. 15 hrs of gameplay),  however the way this battle royale is executed is that whoever has the zone wins,  you can kill half the lobby and then die to the retarrded end zone which you cant outheal.  or better yet you can frag your way through pochinki only to die to some bush wookie in a ghillie suit with a p90 and an awm cos he had the fortune of getting a drop.  minor adjustments would keep this game from being soulcrushingly frustrating.  

TLDR:  game not fun no matter how good you are"

15893,"PUBG is a game that I have played almost religiously since the beta. I loved this game a lot, but I noticed as time went on, the game's performance declined. The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this. I simply cannot recommend this game to anybody, but my voice doesn't matter in the grand scheme here."

15992,"Great battle royale game with varied maps and always different situations. Good variety of weapons and attachments, but not too in depth to make it impossible to comprehend (e.g. Warzone, Tarkov). Definitely recommend getting some friends to play this with you as teamwork is key. Competitive is the true player experience, as there are bots in the casual mode, although not as many as there once were.

Previously there was a massive issue with hackers around 2 years ago, but this issue has since been fixed. I haven't encountered a full blown hacker at all in 2022, perhaps some suspicious players with aim assist but nonetheless quite fair. 

Micro-transactions are numerous in the game, though I wouldn't consider any of them as pay-to-win. Some clothes may help with camouflage but not to a great extent. Prices are fairly reasonable, however the vast majority of cheap and free cosmetics are absolute trash (e.g. brown loafers, plain dirty polo shirt, dirty tank top, who wants this crap?) and so if you want to look at all decent you will need to buy some packs or get a rare Twitch prime drop. 

Overall I would recommend, this is more of an aim and use tactics game as opposed to massive mobility and abilities, more akin to CS:GO and ArmA in playstyle than Apex Legends or Warzone. Plus it's free now, so why not?"

16074,"So what is PUBG and is it fun/worth it? Me and my friend play duo in normal, land somewhere up in the butt, find boat, drive around in it and disembark in one of the coastal towns on the left side of the classic map - we are in the zone (yay). Loot! Find a flare (first time, rare drop?). Spawn BDRM 2 (Combat Reconnaissance Patrol Vehicle - basically armoured car). Drive towards the zone, see another flare go up, but outside of the zone, decide not to chase it. Get shot at by some guy, decide not to engage and dodge him, journey continues (armoured truck HP was half gone, he fired around three mags at us from an assault rifle). See a guy running over a field. Run him over with our metal coffin (carmageddon us 1 them 0), didn't even see or hear us (sneaky snakes). Continue driving. Hear a lot of shooting on the edge of the zone, go over the hill, see the second BRDM and a guy reviving his teammate next to it behind a tree. Go down the hill at full speed and wedge our BDRM between them and their vehicle. Steal it, now we have two armoured cars xD While stealing accidentally run over the guy who was healing (that's two road kills). Race around with two BRDMs. See guys shooting at another group, we blitzkrieg them at full speed and run over one of them, don't manage to kill him completely, he crawls to a rock and keeps circling it, second guy keeps dodging us (we hit each other couple times while trying to get them). They throw a flashbang, bounces off the my tank on wheels like a peanut. We continue to try to run them over until they manage to climb the rock (they happy, floor is lava), friend goes up the hill and then goes full speed towards the rock, manages to drive on top of the rock, kills them both (that's 4 road kills). Continue driving, see a guy behind a tree, go from two sides, drops immediately (I guess his teammate  died earlier) = five kills on wheels. Four players left alive so technically 2v2, just us in the armoured cars and them hiding. Drive around until we find them (they hide behind the trees), they dodge (really damn well at that, them ninjas), until one guy screws up while running from one tree to another (success, Mad Max would be proud, got him crawling). Second opponent gets angry, shoots (funny thing is that up to this point peeps tried to dodge us and no one really shot at the armoured trucks, they can be damaged by AR/SMG), ends up blowing up friends BDRM (was damaged when we stole it). Friend manages to jump out before it explodes (Rambo, explosion on the background), Uzi-sprays the last guy, winner winner chicken dinner. 6 road kills with two assists and one SMG kill :D

16093,"I kind of like this game, it is pretty fun and engaging. High fidelity, low stress environment.

With (personally for me) the only drawback that you have to move across the map to a specific zone, or die.
I would had rather see areas where players are active colored on the map, for instance the map divided into squares each drawn little on the map of about 500 feet in size of size of foot in the game.

With the alternative being a compass that can only be used when players are far from each other, pointing to an area of 500 feet or so, where other players reside. And then battle it out in ordinary game play, just hunting other players.

I'm an ex ARMA soldier, so it didn't surprise me I beat some noobs in the game. Still there also are some highly skilled players, probably w/ an enhanced resolution. My game looks very grainy, and I play with 1 defect speaker, so it's hard to see/hear where opponents are coming/shooting from.

Overall I give this game between 8.7 - 8.9, based on the overall game play. Also I wish there had been keys assigned and with an animation for attaching the scopes. Which in my humble opinion about this great game, would add more to the realism of the experience.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

16219,"Everything in this game is disgusting! I downloaded the game for the first time and entered the match, and as a result, I died from a person with 500 levels. Question...WHERE THE FUCK IS THE DISTRIBUTION BY LEVELS. And yes, exactly, we have a rating mode, only one nuance...HOW TO LOG IN TO IT WITHOUT A FUCKING SUBSCRIPTION?! That is, you made the game initially paid, then when it rolled down and online was in the gutter, you decided to make it paid and give people with the purchased game a subscription with which you can go to rating matches. But the newcomers don't give a fuck! They will play constantly in regular games with people who have 300, 200, 400, 500 levels and will constantly die from players who have been playing for a very long time and know the game well and in general they are professionals. Thank you for this piece of shit, I wish you death :)"

16249,"PUBG is a game that could have been a great game, it has always had the potential but its always been mediocre. I've put 2500+ hours into it because there is nothing else like it, but it is always full of bugs that the developers don't care to fix. Latest patch when writing this review is hilarious, so much desync and of course, the newly introduced ~20% packet loss so that the game bans me for unusual gameplay patterns. Interesting that I'm the one that gets punished for the poor quality of the game."

I paid for the game and now it's free, which I have mixed feelings about. I've had a lot of fun with this game over the years with friends but there is definitely a steep skill cap that will discourage newer players--and a better PC is probably going to have a significant advantage over a subpar PC. Either way, glad it's still alive and I can play it every now and then."

16297,"Game just keeps crashing randomly. Few years ago didn't have any problems. But now when I thought it would be nice to start playing again.. Can't usually finish even one match without a crash. Some maps seems buggier than others where on one map me and my team mate both had a crash exactly at the same time in the same room. Not that much fun when you have played ~15-20 mins and at the end of the game where there is only 10 people left... The game just crashes and you have to reboot and before you get back there the game is already over.

I have already done these:
- Drivers are up to date
- Minimum requirements are easily met as I can run the game at 2560*1440 resolution with everything maxed out and still get constantly over 100 FPS.
- Reinstalled the game
- Verified integrity
- Reinstalled all C++ packages
- Removed all overclocking
- Lowered game settings (though there shouldn't even be need for this when I get over 100 FPS but still didn't help)

We have a group of three players. Two of us have exactly the same problem where the game just crashes randomly 1-3 times per map. That is quite a high failure rate (66% of players are unable to play)...


Edit (27.07.2022):
Developers have done nothing for the game. They still haven't fixed constant crashes and the game is unplayable. Was able to be in a match for less than 5 minutes before crash. First two games didn't even start as there weren't enough players joined to the server."
16298,
16299,"I bought this game, and continued to play it after it became free. Since I bought it, only a couple of maps and some (often broken or inconvenient) tactical equipment have been added, while matchmaking is still region-locked which results in NA region players having to decide between high ping VPN, and bots.

Anti-Cheat has targeted me over trivial issues. Basic user experience problems are ignored and seem to be treated as part of the gameplay's core challenge. They won't add any new large-scale modes. Matchmaking seems to prefer bots over players on another continent regardless of ping. We don't have the ability to select maps.

I really badly want to like this game, but the inattention to glaring issues has made the game not worth a support ticket. These issues include the high-stakes low-reward style deterring new players from getting better at tactical planning, matchmaking being atrocious, ranked being regional, and basic movement being extremely volatile about where you can vault and which random six-inch ledge will stop you from fleeing enemy fire.

Give me a PvPvE zombie mode like mobile did for a while, fix your anti-cheat to make players innocent until found guilty, and I will begrudgingly come back. For now, I'm sorry, I just can't play like this anymore."

16303,"WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!! You hit a guy with 308 to the head? nope, he eats it. You do it again, nope, he laughs it off. Then you get some lvl 500 wiggling hitting every shot lasering you and they can instant kill. Okay so lets try to switch to an smg, pistol caliber. The recoil is so stupidly harsh that even trying to fire bursts is rediculous. Okay, lets go shotgun. NOPE, anything past point blank is laughing at you.  After 100 hours, the lead is so weird that i can't get it down because it's different with every gun. So tell me how 556 can be different between 3 ""DMR"" rifles with roughly the same barrel length. Not that barrel length makes a difference in this game. The guns with bipods can't even use them if your not prone, no window ledges or literally ANYTHING else that you should be able to bipod on. Don't even get me started on the ARs, some of the most inconsistant shit ever. How does a stock AK, no attachments feel better than a fully modded Beryal? Sniping is a joke because regardless of what bolt you use, you can't onetap to the head, LIKE A FUCKING SNIPER RIFLE SHOULD. The damage models are SO fucked, regardless of what you are using, that person will eat 4 or 5 shots easily.  100 hours, 7 wins, i'm good."

16306,PAIN WITHOUT LOVE PAIN I CANT GET ENOUGH PAIN LIKE A ROLL BECAUSE I RATHER FEEL PAIN THAN NOTHING AT AAAALLLLL
16307,"I've been playing this game since ( basically ) release in 2017 across multiple platforms and accounts and have totalled around 1000 hours on the game and despite getting bored every so often and taking a break from the game i've thoroughly enjoyed playing the game itself. 

- The game is kinda unforgiving when it comes to new players but unlike other games, namely counter-strike, PUBG actually tries to ease new players in with the training features, 10 AI matches and then 3 Casual matches per day ( which have 85 bots compared to 15 players if i remember right ). I've said this about games like Fortnite before when people say that the game is bad nowadays compared to what it used to be like, but fundamentally the game is significantly better and no one can argue against this because it's simply facts. The game might not be as enjoyable as it was back 5 years ago when it was a fresh style of game and people played very different to how they do now, but there are so many more features, gamemodes, things to do in general that if we were to go back to how the game was on release, everyone would complain, theres simply no pleasing people when it comes to stuff like this sadly. 

- Another big thing about this game which i've noticed is people complaining about cheaters, and i have no idea how this ""cheater problem"" is such a massive debate in forums because i almost never run into cheaters or people i suspect of cheating. The only time i've encountered people that i *knew* were cheating was on my other account playing ranked against people who didn't even try to hide it, on this account there hasn't been anyone i've ran into that i've suspected of cheating, and yet you visit the forum and all you see is people complaining about cheaters. I have reason to believe its just people who aren't great at the game accusing everyone better than them of cheating due to some ego problems or something, it's very common on competitive games like Siege and CS:GO, but if you're worried about cheaters when starting this game then i hope this sways your mind a bit regarding that.

- The games balancing is fine for the most part, you'll always have people who think certain things are broken, especially when they first release, and sometimes the Devs aren't great at balancing them out. This is mainly referring to the P90, which is an SMG you find in supply drops that doesn't need attachments, has very little recoil and does a lot of damage, and the Devs tried to balance it by reducing the ammo count :/

- I should probably mention how slow paced the game can feel at times, the movement is very clunky and sluggish at times but the shooting feels fantastic, it takes some getting used to but it's satisfying once you do.

- Overall the game is enjoyable if you like the competitive side of games as well as the steep learning curve this game has, like recoil control, bullet drop and speed, the attachments, ammo etc. I do recommend the game in general though because it is fun and the Devs are constantly adding new features and maps which keep the game feeling as fresh as a Battle Royale game can be in 2022, it's a stale and outdated style that i'm glad games are moving away from, it was much more interesting 5 years ago when games like this, H1Z1 and Fortnite were new but now it's just overdone, but with that being said, PUBG is still enjoyable for the most part and if it seems interesting to you then you should give it a try ( maybe a few tries )."

16336,"to start off the game doesn't make sense. the weapons have too much recoil, the fact that i can hold down my mouse button and my weapon goes instantly 2 feet into the air doesn't make sense to me even when having attachments and holding down, another reason is that when i shoot an entire mag into someone's head but they can still kill me with 7 bullets from their gun is also straight up bullshit. ANOTHER THING is that fact that shotguns can one shot you no matter the gear is the worst mechanic i have ever seen in my entire life and i am a game developer for christ sake, i can make a better game in a week than this trash. for once in your life actually listen to the community instead of only caring about money and rubbing money on your dick for real."

16465,good
16466,fgsdfsdfsdfsdf
16467,Happy to see devs finally updating their anti-cheat.This is by far the best and most realistic fps battle royale. What makes me enjoy this ranked over any other game is the rewards and the feeling you get once you kill someone
16468,gud game
16469,THIS GAME MADE MY PUSSY HURT.

16472,Had fun with my friends even though it was bit lag.
16473,Cabrón! I want my money back!!
16474,k
16475,sssssssssssssssssssss
16476,"hi
"
16477,"Bought it on release and couln't play it then because of terrible optimalization. Now I can't play it because of hackers. 

Honestly I feel like the mobile version did better in terms of ""balance"" and getting rid of cheaters. 

This ""game"" is just long run scam."
16478,kren
16479,graphics are amazing even played with low profile gpu
16480,Good game~!
16481,i bought this game at release wheres my refund
16482,"Game is very nice designed. But I don't like games who are based on hardware/software settings like extremly high brightness.
If you want to win many games you need to destroy your ears. The audio problem is especially for players who cannot locate audio very good and there are many players who cannot locate noise. Watch your teammates simply. 

But the most problem of this game: Very beginner unfriendly (yes there are some tutorials/ki-matches and casual matches, but this doesnt really help you, because you will play at your first ""normal"" or ""ranked"" match against lvl 500 (that means they have much higher play-time). 

And if you maybe know CSGO then you will see that PUBG has a much more toxic community, most teams don't play as a team."
16483,bought the game for like 30 bucks and now its free so wheres my money
16484,GO TO THE MAP
16485,"OK game. Now that its f2p, you and your buddies can squad up and enjoy it."

16494,forced a tutorial for a game that does not need it and then made the tutorial impossible to complete because no ads was accepted. Still almost as bad as when they had a ton of hackers
16495,nice
16496,game isn't bad but the recoil on all the weapons is the worst i have ever seen in a game. DONT BUY THIS GAME!
16497,"GW noob tapi gpp lah. WKAAKOKWWK, KONTEN KONTEN"
16498,"Devs are here to make money, not build an enjoyable game. As someone who's played since beta, I can say with confidence this game has done nothing but gone downhill."
16499,"This game is nice to play with friends or alone, depens on your play style. Strategic... yes you will need to improvise strats to become the last survivor or the last thriving team. There is also a small itch if you have the minimum requirements I hope you dont mind if the game is laggy because it needs a bit more stability via updates and optimization. But overall the game is hella nice!"

16518,"This game has had insane ups and downs. I personally hold some good memories with friends playing this game, and even playing this game overseas in a pc cafe setting. It's great fun but there can be a lot of bots in certain modes, and matchmaking rarely put me/us with anyone, let alone anyone who uses microphone. Who knows, now that its free that's probably all fix. Solid 7/10 You should just try it."
16519,"LMAO this game is so unpolished it's unbelievable. Aiming and aiming down sights needs to be two different buttons? Ah yes, it is very necessary to have 3 different forms of healing and 2 necessary items to heal to max hp. Manually have to equip every single weapon attachment for some reason. This game is one of the oldest battle royales and it still hasn't learned from its competitors. No wonder it went f2p."

Anyway I installed the game and said to give it a try. After the first 15 seconds a bug appreared. I was shooting a target in practice missions and my shots we'rent being validated as hitting the target when i actually was. None of them were and i got stuck in practice missions.

Don't expect to play this game at all if you AREN'T A CHEATER/HACKER. Apparently you can get banned for just playing the game! I only play Solo's, my W/L ratio is 0.33 or something and my K/D Ratio is 1.3...Totally hacking, eh?

I played some Arcade matches, left a couple because it just wasn't enjoyable. There's no warning at the exit screen insisting I'll be banned for leaving the match so WHAT THE !#@$? Don't waste your time on this pathetically developed game.

16777,.
16778,yes buy it
16779,TOOO FUNNNN
16780,Used to be a great game
16781,Good thing its free other things still unchanged after coming back from 2 years gap. Sluggish unresponsive game play. Hunts showdown does it better as realistic gunfight. The developers have definitely checked out few years ago. Just a money   grabbing game atm with skins etc..
16782,It went downhill after they removed map selection :)
16783,"this i have no idea how to call them whoever make the game or own the game selling hack to people is desgusting you can t have fun all the animals chines and turkish people and 80% of people ussing hack, shame on you!!!!"
16784,"This game on technical level is dog shit tier. It takes forever to load into the main menu or the match itself, has SERIOUS texture streaming issues with terrible LOD (to the point where you can't see building until last 100 meters while air-dropping) and to top it off, it crashes my graphics drivers from time to time. Seriously, I have played different titles of varying quality (recently Cyberpunk 2077, GTA IV, Fallout 4 or Ghost Recon: Breakpoint) and only this game has the ability to face-plant my GPU while trying to render PS3-era map geometry. On the newest patch it has crashed 3 times in a row on the first boot-up. Sure I can download 27 GB again but what about you? Do you have fiber internet and extra free time to troubleshoot it?

Stay clear from this pile of burning trash. I can't wrap my mind about the fact people for 5 years or so were PAYING for this gopnik level software and how it's supoosed to be ""E-sports ready"". It's fun to play this with friends. BUT! So is drinking or playing other games. Games which are actually working, which get extensive bugfixing instead of more kpop cosmetics for vbucks each patch. Which do not require Hadron Collider and instead can be played on PC that can also run RDR2 or God of War in 1080p 60fps for entire day no problem.

I got it for free from F2P and yet I feel robbed."
16785,great game
16786,
16787,"Crashes constantly. At least 3-4 hard crashes for every 6 games (tops!) without even an error message. There are also very common visual glitches. Many hackers too. I got about 5-6 notifications of a player being banned as part of my report in only 80 hours of gameplay, with about let's say 20 reports submitted tops.

Right before I uninstalled this spaghetti code dumpster fire, it crashed 4 times IN THE SAME MATCH. A big shame, because the game itself is actually pretty fun and very skill-oriented."

16802,Interesting game
16803,Awfully optimized. Some friends report issues like crashes or 10 minute loading times. For others it runs significantly better which probably means it has huge compatibility issues too. The gameplay might be fun but sometimes it feels like its very luck based. Also be prepared to have games where nothing interesting happens for 10 minutes and then you run into some camper killing you and making you lose the game without you even seeing them.

16806,"The game started off great so much hype and so much awesomeness plus a lot of players. Sadly that was years ago and this game is now in the dumps, the moment they put bots into normal games is the moment they lost me. After that I only played about once every year, sadly last time I TRIED playing I couldn't even jump into a normal game right away!! like I always do. They required me to do a ""tutorial"" of sorts.... even after playing the game for hundreds of hours. Needless to say I wasn't going to waste my time doing some bull crap butt tutorial to play a dying game with nothing but BS, so I uninstalled and am never looking back. Thanks for the memories pubG you had a good run."

Yes there are cheaters, is it annoying? Yes. The chance of seeing them? idk, for me its like one in ten games. TBH the chances of you getting killed by a skilled veteran in this game is higher than getting killed by a hacker rn, atleast thats what it's like for me on NA servers.

In this game is nothing more serious when you loot your enemy and you pick up a pink AK with Manga stickers on it...

16949,nice game
16950,i love it pugb
16951,I mean it's like kinda fun or whatever but I don't wanna recommend it to anyone
16952,"Let's get the short and simple answer out of the way, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! This game is an absolute travesty, 8-10 players will be closet cheaters or in most cases, not even trying to hide it. 
- ESP AKA Wall hacks are commonplace
- Auto aim is required to compete in gun trades
- Terrible game optimization
- Predatory lootbox skin system
- 90% of players use no recoil macros
- Very few level 500's are legit, most of the long time playerbase has turned to cheating as a way to even the playing field
- No map selection as of writing this, so have fun getting the same boring map 900 times in a row
- Do not be misguided by steam charts player count, this game is basically dead in any region other than China (where most of the cheaters come from)
Developers are too busy rolling in their blood money to bother listening to any of their remaining players concerns
I've only managed to get to 270 hours by playing with my family and goofing off, otherwise I would've uninstalled worthless game day 1 as these issues were all ready apparent. I suggest if you're looking for a BR game just play Warzone since there you can at least be a monkey.

One thing I would ask to be updated is the Armor resistance, seems like Lvl 2 gear is the same as lvl 1. Maybe its too realistic? although it is just a game, just seems kind of odd I can be dropped from 80m with a UMP 45. Other than that, the game is super fun, no lag issues, smooth shooting and recoil management. I would highly recommend it. I will also continue to play it!"

Dev's need to pay more attention to optimising their game properly, but considering how late into the game it is, 99.9% sure they don't care.

Still, the game is really good and worth playing. Just stupid crashes and bugs.."
17018,yes
17019,Mehh.
17020,I have over 100 hours in this game and because it went free to play it made me play the tutorial. It's clear that the devs do not care about the player base playing this game and only want more people to play it so they waste more money on their shitty in-game skins
17021,they need to update the movement it has been out for so long and that is the biggest thing holding it back is how awful the movement feels they spend all this time adding stuff instead of fixing the core problem s keeping people away from this game it feels like im disabled when i try to move around the map
17022,fuck the damn recoil !

17038,"    Personally, I'm one of the lucky few to have bought PUBG long ago. Not exactly when it first came out, but dang near close. It has recently became free to play in place of the $30 price tag it used to have. This, however has not come without benefits to all. PUBG now offers a lifetime subscription to PUBG Plus for all who had previously purchased the game, as well as some premium currency to offset the cost. I have thoroughly enjoyed getting back into the game and very much appreciate the path they have taken to revive the player base while still acknowledging the early supporters. Thank you PUBG!"

17067,"are you ready for my honest review?
here we go...
I enjoy the game I do.
three issues with it:
#1 recoil of the weapon is super hard to control.
#2 sometimes you can't change and equip clothes, weapons, and other items for no reason, just a bag.
#3 you cant choose the map you want to play it's just random.
so you stuck with the map the server hands to you.

So the game is fun.
fix the issues above and it will be much better!.
Also now you cant configure your own volume in the setting,"
17068,its a amazing game

17073,"Yay, PUBG!WOHOO

At least this game gave me and my friends many hours of fun.

Today I can't really enjoy it anymore since they get more and more skins and emotes. I only play 1 or 2 matches mostly on maps which I don't like and way more kills since they introduced bots. It is not so challenging and fun anymore as it was back in the days.

But because I had really nice experiences and times with this game, it gets a nice rating from me.
And since this is free now, you can try it yourself and may find out I'm wrong or right. Have Fun :)

Bread scale: A slice of toast



Update: 13.07.2022
I have a better laptop than the one I last played this game on. I wanted to go back to one of my favorite games and breathe life into it again. But from today it will probably never be played by me again.

While streaming it:
Match: 40 FPS High settings, only loaded when I was kicked out of the plane and then the buildings didn't load properly like back then, so you have to walk through walls because you can't even see a door -> bugged around until I could finally pick something up . Playing time approx. 2min.
Next Match: Set settings to lowest for FPS boost to 50 FPS and then play Combat at 10(!) FPS???
That's a joke, isn't it?

So I tried it without the stream.
80 FPS on lowest (old laptop managed 40 on lowest). Same as almost every match start. Long loading time, buildings are bugged, which took a lot of time to get equipment and weapons. Then I heard footsteps, got ready, suddenly the furniture loaded in and pushed me into the middle of the room. Then the enemy came in, I shot and before I heard my shots, the enemy was somewhere else and I was dead. My eyes went to the FPS and I was severely disappointed. I can see that when there is a lot going on, there are FPS drops. But going from 80 FPS to 35... It's sad.

Another problem are the opponents that are too high. I don't blame anyone because they enjoy playing the game and leveling accordingly. But I would like to survive more than 2 minutes like back then. Especially since it takes 1 minute to load into the match and another 40 seconds to parachute and wait until you can pick something up.

I've never been particularly good at aiming, nor do I expect this game to run at 100+ FPS for me and I don't even expect to get a kill. But if I am not even able to think because my enemies are more experienced than I (yes, got many h but I am only 150 or something).
I could have a chance against someone who is 400+... but only if he would be as bad as me..which, you guessed it, wouldn't be likely.

But I expected to have a game that would have been worth at least the price i paid for it back then.


So I have to downgrade this. They massacred my boy.

I see alot of people dont like this game because of the bugs & hackers at the time of me writing the review Ive played 126 hours Level 143 ive only come across to what i believe to be one hacker but this stuff can happen in any game.
 I feel like this game is not popular anymore in the United States i wish more people would give this game a chance.
This game is way more fun when you play with friends and do hilarious stuff in the game.
PUBG is very hard to master but once you start playing you will learn fast and become a great player.

So im gonna end my Review with saying PUBG is an Amazing game you learn teamwork and concentration
i love this game and i highly recommend playing it.

17119,"This game can be pretty fun with friends and keyboard use, but attempting to use a controller will honestly be a bit frustrating sometimes. I use controller, and I cannot ready up or continue without using my keyboard (buttons on controller don't work). Also, when using controller, you cannot use your keyboard to spectate or leave to lobby, and pressing random buttons to figure out how to get to lobby or spectate will glitch your game out, so you have to force-quit the game to go back into it again. I wish PUB:G on Steam (PC) would have better controller compatibility, but other than that, I have no other issues with the game."

17211,"[h1]About game[/h1]
Playerunknown’sbattleground is a Battle royal and Survival Open World with both first-person and third-person perspective shooting. It is limited to a maximum of 100
players per match starting at the same time. If anyone can survive until the
last person. will be the winner. In addition to that, during 1 round of play,
besides the poison circle that will create excitement and fun for the players,
the game PUBG also has Airdrop and Red Zone. will come every 5-10 minutes There
are special items that cannot be found on the map, such as level 3 armor, level
3 helmets. Including high-powered guns, the Red Zone is a large red circle.
that if someone is in that circle, there will be a bomb falling from the sky If
anyone gets hit, they die instantly.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The players can play either Solo, Duo, or Full squad(Up to 4 people). The game has many
modes to choose from such as Zombie, Normal Mode, Ranked, Training, Team
deathmatch, etc. For a big new update, PUBG(Playerunknown’s battleground) will
adjust to Free-to-play which means you don't have to pay for the game anymore
but except for the ranking mode it needs to buy Battleground plus first for
access to ranking mode but people who bought the game earlier will get
Battleground plus for free. For the weapon, there are many weapons that
you can use such as assault rifles, SMG, sniper rifles. In addition to guns, there are also gun accessories that will drop according to different maps. for example, Calibers ranging from Red Dot, Holo scope, to caliber *4,*2, *8, and *15.
[h1]Rankmode[/h1]
In rank mode will be more special than the normal mode, the drop rate is doubled and is
limited to 64 players only. The ranking system will add points, meaning that if
you die quickly, you will lose a lot of points, but if you want to collect a
lot of points, you have to survive as long as possible, or killing enemies will
also be able to increase points as well. Ranks range from Bronze to Master. At
the end of each season, each rank will receive different rewards. But you can
only get rewards if you are in gold rank or above.

Also dev when you fix the botting issue  send me a message id love to reinstall."

17287,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 18, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because PUBG gave me cancer anyway."

17317,"10 stupid boring matches with the ai really?
"
17318,"I BOUGHT this game back when it was in early access. I'm fine with the idea that it went free to play. That's the gamble you take with a game like that. But I stopped playing it back in early 2019 when the game was such garbage that an i7-7700k and a 1070 would get MAYBE get 32 fps. I thought I would give it another shot in 2022 since they have had some time to fix the issues. But NOW I have to finish 10 AI matches for a game I initially helped fund making. Not a huge deal to require a tutorial with a free to play game. Warzone does it (and much better). But now I am going to have to spend a solid two hours of my time to play the tutorial of a game I have 250 hours in already. Why? Because they are apparently incapable of having two senses behind developing a game. Classic PUBG. Take an interesting game, notice the problems of the game as it is in it's current state, then immediately shoot yourself in the foot when making a solution to said problem. 

People leaving your game because it's full of cheaters and the server/game itself are less optimized than a bagel in a toaster? 

Develop a new map because that will obviously solve the issues of cheating and server/game optimization. 

Make your game free to play and people flood the game that don't know what they are doing because there is no price of admission? 

Force them to play two hours of training to teach them (whether or not they are planning on playing the game with their friends that night/ they are time constrained and just want to play a new game). 


PUBG is a respectable game with decent perfomance (nowadays), that will always limp across the finish line because of the backward thinking management ideas (IMO) and poorly devised solutions that's spawned from said management ideas. Have fun with your chicken dinners, because there are steak and lobster meals elsewhere for the same amount of money spent here."

The glaring issue that myself and a vast amount of the PUBG community is facing is after about 15 minutes the game will completely freeze my entire computer. I have to manually power cycle my computer. I have tried everything recommended and have scoured the internet for hours to try and find a resolution but nothing has worked. If this issue is resolved I would recommend this game but until then I don't recommend anyone play it."

Granted, most of the people still playing are extremely high level, and their skills are great as well.  That being said,  PUBG does offer several battles (3 a day) where you are playing in a more casual mode. I believe its to acquaint you with the map, and stuff in it. But they could improve things like show you what the special items do. 
My recommendation is to find a friend who is an expert, and let them show you the ""ropes"".   Just remember, like ""The Mummy""   ""Death is only the beginning"".....So, grab a skillet, watch your six, and have some fun..."

With players not even needing to AIM correctly ( https://youtu.be/u5dXSih3T3Y ) and the game being broken ( https://youtu.be/tpBcrtZJlkI ) I'd say play something else. Games go from Pay-2-Play to Free-2-Play for a reason. PUBG might have made BR games popular, but I can see why so many other BR games are doing better than PUBG.

17520,Realistic Shooting Game
17521,"nice
"
17522,"PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS is just a whole other thing. The way it is done is well put together and makes me want to play more, first time in a long time I have not gotten this interest in-game and that much enterainment. 

It is battle royale game with unique shooting experience, focused on sound and visual quality. Each player is required to scavenge survival supplies, as well as to exploit the maximum potential of the map terrain, vehicles and gear. Main goal is to become the last team standing on the battleground. 

Point of view from player level 100:

Beggining of game is very fun, they throw you among bot populated lobbys and low tier players but you are still able to choice between: Solo, duo and squad. Staying there until level 80 to learn basics and get into game, really chill place to be and playing with other community members is enjoyable as they are mainly mature and helpfull. After a while will experience elements of adrenaline, loads of fun and desire for more. 

Once you get PUBG basic plus+ for free  there is where fun ends. No, you can't disable it. 

Lobbys will be populated with mainly level 500 players who are heavly camping and intensely sweating even in custom games. Besides their hours of experience and aiming skills it will put your skills on test. Then after few games you will realize that you need to posses skills and knowledge more then average player if you want to stay even in top 30. Not only that but will experience players who use third part softwers to gain advantages: Aimbot, no recoil, wallhack, speedhack, long shot distance hack, you name it. Then game starts becoming unenjoyable, unbalanced and unfair, especially if you play ranked matches. But you frustration gets even worst when you start noticing issues with game which you didn't care much before and they are plenty, as follows:

First of all, launching game will make you wait 90 seconds till game loads, sometimes followed with black screen and lobby sound. In late hours will
experience unpopulated lobby and wait at least 10 minutes till game starts. When joining lobby where match starts within 10 seconds it can happend that you are in plane and can hear sound of it and people jumping but your screen is still loading until plane reach almost edge of map. While jumping with parachute will most likely experiencing cracking or freezes, as well map synching problem and fps drops. If you are lucky enought crashing. You might survive that but probably won't an level 500 player on distance of 326 meters with x4 sight scope shooting at you with m4 full auto down in single dot, true obstacles and it happens to be your head. In case that you have vehicle, unrealistic drive and flipping is too easily that you might get away 2 meters away and die at distance of 328 meters. 

Support will only answer if they have benefits not even bothering to check your reports even if you sent video proof. In case getting answer it will be more in sort of automated message. 

Missed potential.

17546,"Literally just got banned for 4 days for reasons unknown. I don't cheat and don't disrupt. I've got like a 1.8 K/D. Thanks pubg for not even taking the time to physically look into it. I quit 2 yrs ago because you want to start chrging g-coin for everything and being money hungry cuz your game is failing. How about instead of adding a bunch of paid cosmetics ( some of which are upwards of $1,000 ) you fix the issues. Sad to say after 3 yrs i might have to walk away again when previously i was in the top 10 in NA."

17568,"Good game, good graphics, decent player base. Alot of virgins run around on here level 500 or high 100's cheating if you do feel your death is suspicious view the death cam 4/5 times its actually some nolife aim locking you with no spread from 367m away.

17571,"PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS was the first battle royale game I’ve ever played. I bought it on its release, but I haven’t played it until this year. I’d like to say that after years of optimizations, patches and so on, the developers have managed to bring it to perfection, so I can’t say anything bad about it. Exactly, what can I say about the gameplay, is that it’s the same for its genre. I am very satisfied with the game, and I think that any game in that genre can’t be comparative with that one."
17572,"For the start, as long as the newbies get matched with experienced players, there won't be any new players because every normally thinking person will just leave after 5-10 matches. Good luck with this game, but from what I see in reviews, it's full of cheaters anyway. It's also crashing for no obvious reason, optimisation is basically non-existent, unpleasantly blurry distance view - no matter the graphics settings, your character is partly pixelized - again, no graphic settings fixed it.
Well, honestly, no wonder long-time players are just leaving.
So to put it all together, new-comers are being pushed out by hackers and players with 1000h+ and most likely because of crashing game. And veteran players who experience nearly the same issues simply leave as well.
How to fix it? Well, get anti cheat, fix the game, create sensible matchmaking and hope there still some people interested in playing PUBG instead of childish Fortnite.
The end :)"
17573,"I have played this for 280+ hours! Recently downloaded it again after some months inactivity, and I was prompted with TRAINING????? I need to complete training missions before I can play online? Nah, sorry bruh ain't gonna happen! *uninstall*"

The only things that happend that day was:

3x i got kicked from the game to PUBG network problems
1x accidentally opened Call of Duty Warzone (next to browser shortcut)

Shame was pumped this game went free... but I can see why. Uninstalling, It's 2022 I'm pretty sure I know how to click in a shooter. Also, if this is to like deter cheaters... wouldn't they just have a script or not care cause they'd want to continue cheating on an alt? Sounds like lazy devs trying to find a half-assed backdoor workaround. I don't have 4 hours to play with bots."

The Anti-cheat is useless, the cheating situation basically makes this competitive game unplayable EVERY GAME because there are cheaters in literally every game no matter unrated or competitive. So my question is this, for players like us who supported from the beginning, whoever paid for the game, what gives you blue a$$-hole the right to disrespect like that??? I sincerely hope this game die and please do it quick. Blue hole doesn't deserve any credits besides the helper tool of cheaters, so you all can go f yourselves."

Weapon sounds are too loud, so I do recommend installing Sound Locker which compresses the deafening shots from weapons, because otherwise you're left with bad hearing and or tinnitus, or just not being able to hear footsteps :9"

17747,"Beware snowflakes, stop reading now, critical personal opinions to follow:

Returned to the game after a good whiles break, it was like nothing had changed, which seemed to be a good thing, however. Bots in every game outside ranked fucking ruin the game. Theres nothing fun about killing the bots, and it dulls the gameplay to the point where you're near asleep by the time you fight players.

If you do choose to play ""ranked"", you're forced to play a selection of the utterly garbage maps they've thrown in. The only decent addition to the map pool Vikendi/snowmap, they've removed, and unfortunately the braindead audience in southkorea seems to have voted garbage like Sanhok as their favorite map, so theres no change in sight. While ranked games do provide you with only human players you are forced to play squads, and as someone who primarily enjoyed Duos its sad to see that I can't even sit around in longer queues and wait for a ranked duos match even if i wanted to.

Like I said, upon return it seemed like everything was just as it used to, yet this is the problem. Even under Brian Greene this game was being run like an absolute trainwreck, and anyone with half a brain could envision and steer this game to be a great product. However he failed, and Krafton or whoever is running this has utterly failed. Everything is underwhelming, the playlists are utter garbage, the lootbox systems have been blatantly copied off other games and are somehow the worst copy I've seen, and the few things good they added to the game they've somehow fucked up and removed.

At this point theres simply too many other options to bother playing this game, which is sad and pathetic considering the opportunity they had."
17748,"I didn't encounter any hacker the people were talking about at all, unless they are in the Rank Arena. The game is good but, you have to pay for the rank. Am not the kind of guy who would spend my money in this game. So to me is half-half."
17749,"This game is complete and utter dogshit. It has been since the day it was released all that time ago. As far as bugs go, it literally hasn't gotten any better since release. They just keep adding content without fixing anything they break. Good luck playing humans when you first start because you get dropped into really easy bot lobbies to try and suck you in."

17828,"
I feel it is the most fascinate one I like the graphic and enjoy with the game plays.
At first when early release of this game I bought this game to play with my friends I felt so scary to meet some people (like you watching horror movie) that time the graphic is normal, game play has many bugs and that is what I recall them as nothing game. I prefer to enjoy accompanying playing with friends than playing alone. Then I just know that it is a battle royal! The concept is you are the survivor one who have the ability of military equally in the battle area among people that you didn’t know before (that maybe the truly name player unknown battle grounds) then you must get inside the circle area in the map if you are not or you are outside the circle area your HP will be gradually decrease depended on the phrase level (actually outside called blue zone) the circle will be reduce them area until people met and kill them all left the one who survive . In normal match making Each round there are 100 people in the map and it will show the current number of survivors at the top-right and there also be the red zone that will show you in the map when it happened. For this area you may be the lucky one died from the air missile. But the worst thing I met when my CPU is out of date in term of performance or maybe the requirement of this game has increase that make my computer just run this game around 60 framerate and a desire to play had decrease too. Anyway, I certainly be funny now. Survive with the several ways and to be number one is my fun!

Game runs worse than it did 5 years ago, which is also very strange and retarded. It is retarded in the sense that the game is worse now than it was when it was released 5 years ago."

Matches are just so much of a dam chore to go through now. Wait times are still incredibly bad. It takes 1 min for the drop to initiate, which isn't bad but.. Before that sometimes wait times can be longer because of the waiting for players lobby section. Feels like they could have done much better instead of declining down worse."

17977,"Now with the game that went free-to-play, the playing field for players who have not played in ages like myself or new players is much more balanced, and you can (re)learn the game on your own pace. I played PUBG very little, but i have the game since it was in beta. 

In later seasons, i did come back shortly, but didn't enjoy it due to the fact that there were too many experienced players already among newer ones, and felt very much like a unbalanced matchmaking, or that you were simply way too rusty to compete.

PUBG has improved and changed a lot since, and i feel going F2P was the right move here to once again bring in new players and balance out matchmaking. Surprisingly, PUBG putting ranked behind PUBG + is a decision i can stand behind, and that one is to keep as many cheaters out of them. (and in terms of cheaters, i also haven't noticed any obvious cheaters since i played again)

Make no mistake, this is also not a game you should take lightly, and PUBG has a steep learning curve, from gun handling to using peaking, cover and angles to your advantage, and most importantly, listen well and look well, PUBG gives zero indications, other than sound, from which direction you are getting shot from.

For people who return or want to pick it up, i would suggest just playing it and learning it, and like myself, who probably has no intent on ever touching ranked, casuals are just as good for me to play now from time to time."
17978,"Coming from xbox to pc, this game is unrecognizable. I will continue to enjoy this favorite of mine."
17979,"Sometimes fun, often frustrating. Someone in a squad of 4 crashes every other game or so.

My friends have a mantra when we play this, ""it's a good game."" Random crashes and disconnects? ""It's a good game."" Buggy guns that don't load until you drop them and pick them back up? Network desync makes it seem like you got knocked out behind cover? Footstep audio glitches? ""It's a good game."" Some of the jank is fun (vehicle physics!), but in a game based on randomly distributed advantages it's unbearable when you are betrayed by unreliable software.

Still having fun with it, though, it's a fun group game if everyone is on the same page. Core BR mechanics were revolutionary and still draw me in where higher-paced competing franchises do not.

Shame about the lack of customer support (the Steam support link gives a 404 as of March 2022), and the anti-cheat solution feels half-baked (day long bans are handed out based on player reports, regardless of if you were actually cheating... hackers keep playing after short break, legit players get frustrated)."

18024,"I mean, I 've been playing this game [b]almost[/b] since it got released. Lots of hours wasted, lots of fun stuff have happened in PUBG's battlegrounds. Unfortunately, I will have to say that it's one of the best battle royals in the market, that focuses on gun-play, and not on building mechanics, or magic spells or whatever. That says a lot, because ...

On the downsides, the game has a lot of cheaters, even with the 3-4 anti-cheats they have added into the game. Bugs and crashes are not uncommon, even on high-end rigs. For a new player, up to level 80, you will face mostly bots on your games - and there is nothing you can do about it. Finally, the company is extremely greedy, which is reflected upon their market, that is filled with overpriced digital clothing and skins, that many of them are not even marketable. 

If you have friends to play this game, go ahead. Otherwise, stay away from it, as far as possible. 

Overall I give it a nice 6/10."

18031,"Overrated garbage.

Apparently this game is now 4 years old, and they haven't done a thing about the hackers and other cheaters? Is it supposed to be fun when you view the Death Cam and see that the other person was able to perfectly follow your character's/""playerunknown""'s head, even through walls? What's the point of this game claiming to have an anti-cheat system when it doesn't even prevent wallhacks? At this point, your game is far more likely to end via hacking than due to someone actually being any good at the game. There's a reason that videos proving cheating in this game are so common.

Tried to just play offline, as online play is often overrated... and turns out that it's limited, and the bots in this game are terrible, worse than the AI in some 90's FPS games.

May as well have been made by EA. All they care about is selling loot boxes. The quality of their game clearly doesn't matter to them, just making stupid costumes. I may have put more effort into this review than they've put into fixing the bugs in their game.

...and this isn't that important compared to the other stuff, but ""Winner winner chicken dinner"" is a lazy and stupid rhyme."

18094,"PUBG is a game that I have played almost religiously since the beta. I loved this game a lot, but I noticed as time went on, the game's performance declined. The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this. I simply cannot recommend this game to anybody, but my voice doesn't matter in the grand scheme here."

This game is amazing. It has come a long way since launch; since I have only just started playing it again. I like the fact the developers are putting in the time and effort to keep up with this game.

I am excited to see the future releases and will give an actual critical review after more hours."

18140,"No improvement in game-play after five years other than new maps. I have recently fallen through the maps. There are small glitches that occur with rocks being purple or dust being kicked up that is purple, and not to mention the invisible guns. I have a 3060 TI which can handle most games. It is the game and it's the little things. Don't waste your money. 

It's frustrating when a semi-auto shotgun cannot penetrate through a thin metal handrail on the top floor of a stairwell. The aiming mechanics are bad as well. The scope of any gun is like a foot above the gun barrel. Good luck shooting out of windows."

With the reporting feature it's pretty easy to notify the mods. After playing about 20-hours, I purchased the game as it was a reasonable price."

18238,"Game full of cheaters, devs don't care, not going to do anything"
18239,"
After 3 years and 3,250 hours of gameplay, I was Permanently Banned from PUBG without any reasoning provided. I have purchased every Event Pass,making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.

This was a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 6 years I have owned STEAM. as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.

I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.

My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame."
18240,the game doesnt support  freedom of speech smh cant even shit talk when you die said faggot to a dev once and got banned for a month lol

18458,"Player Unknown Battle Grounds Review:
________________________________
Okay so starting off I just wanna say... This game is absolutely fucking incredible,
It is a Battle Royale-Tactical-Shooter, Basing off realism combat strats and more.
The game is one of the best Battle Royale Shooters you're gonna find unlike games like, Fortnite, Warzone, and things like that. Those games are pretty unrealistic when it comes to gun control moving around the maps looting and things like that or tho warzone is not a bad game this game just beats it in everyway, Lemme explain.
( Side Info: Due to this game focusing on realism its fun and makes you feel the fear of death. But dying is only one way to learn in this game so dont get mad if you die learn from it and improve by your old mistakes.)
_________________________
( Gameplay ) :
Starting off with Gameplay let's talk about guns and gun control.
Guns feel real, and fun to use in this game not only with their control+firerate+sounds 
They are just awesome to use in this shooter,
The guns kind of handle like in CSGO as in you are more accurate when not moving and hit more shots when not spraying. But the twist is in this game you can! This game takes time to master the guns so dont get discouraged by how hard they are to use at first. (USE SEMI FIRE WHEN A NEW PLAYER!)
remember this game focuses on realism. So of course like i said their hard to use. Now The Sprays on the guns are pretty basic but at times can be different, For starters the AK-47 A basic world known and loved gun by a lot of people. It's got a pretty basic spray but massive recoil how do you control this? Simple, Move your mouse slowly downwards when firing at other players for the most control out of the gun, Even do tap fires to get more shots in, just don't let the gun control you.
_____________
This is all i can offer for guns please search up a guide on youtube seeming i'm not a expert on them haha.
_____________
(Movement):
Moving around in this game feels Smooth and actually takes time to get from A TO B seeming this isn't war-zone where you run like fucking Barry Alan in the flash.
The movement is simple and feels fun, You can find vehicles to help you get around the map in a short matter of time but making it more risking to do so, Seeming the car produces A LOT of noise to nearby players and gives you away in a matter of seconds, But gives you quite a bit of protection. there fore sprinting around in this game allows you to be stealthy and careful but puts you at risk to snipers on the mountains or in the long grass ahead-behind-or beside you. So be CAREFUL when moving on-foot. 
Now footsteps are easily hurt so tend to slow-walk around the map esp in Hot-spots that you know have other HOSTILE players when you first drop with them.
_____________________________________
(Combat): 
The Combat in this game feels compelling and realistic seeming you have recoil-control fire-sprays as before said. when in a gunfight you can have a matter of attachments and tools to your disposal such as, Frag Grenades, Medkits, Bandages, Pain Killers, Sights, Scopes, Grips, Different MAG Types, And etc.
Gun fights in this game are unforgiving as fuck so tend to not get shot yeah? AND THIS GAME IS ESP UNFORGIVING WITH NEW PLAYERS! So try to do squads to learn from others (ppl are toxic cuz theres a lotta weird ppl in this game lmao) But there are also super nice ppl willing to help so they can help you learn how to be top-notch in gunfights.
Also make sure to use Cover, Peaking, and other tactics to your disposal !
_____________________
(Graphics-How does this game perform on a Low End-Spec Laptop-Desktop?)
This game is a amazing masterpiece ranging to a large scale of maps that are just beautiful to play on.
This game also has Different Optional graphic settings to use such as, Ultra Graphics, High Graphics, Medium Graphics, Low Graphics, Potato Graphics, Potato graphics can be achieved by setting up your own Modded Custom Settings to mess around with. Now this game doesn't run well on low end laptops. But theres a solution to that file configs. but dont worry about that. I run a 550 HD GRAPHICS Card with a I-5 Processor so the game runs like absolute dog shit. So i hope yall got better specs then me lmao I kinda fixed the issue but god damn it the game needs more playability for low end.
___________________
Is this game fun to play?
Well yes, but can be frustrating at times due to people who are lvl 500 and have been playing this game for years and aim like a fucking spaz on 200 epi pens which means they will quick tap your ass like your nothing. but learn from this and be better then them!, Also watch guides to find the best tactics you can!
I'd recommend learning from WhackyJacky seeming he has the best guides on the game today.
That's all i have to say seeming I've only got 20 hours and I am still learning to hopefully this help you fellow Badass survivors and have a great time on the battlefield!

18461,"This game is perfect actually. Visual, Gun Realisms, Game modes. Literally everything, except the main thing of playing this kind of game, ranking system. It is absolutely horrifying that such a low level always got to match with LVL500 all the time. I understand the reason that in a match it should have both noobs and pros. But in real life it doesn't work like that, it is not a joy to play for beginner like me to get killed by pro always. Indeed also for pros to meet noob that make them feel they are degraded. People should be in same level that been brought to the match to make it fair and fun at the same time. I am a person who don't mind losing in any game, but this is too much and it is stressful to play, shame for Visual and Variety of guns this game has to offer has been held down badly by its ranking systems"

Anyone who does know how to play drives around in cars and drive-bys the entire lobby because PUBG thought it was a brilliant idea to have perfect stabilization for aiming while driving over any kind of terrain (yes they are that stupid) or camps in buildings until the circle moves. Everyone else just uses incredibly unbalanced shotguns that one shot you from 20 meters regardless of your armor (yes, the developers are again that stupid). They do nothing about either of these issues for a few patches now so it is unlikely they will ever do anything. Play something better. Don't waste your time"

18523,"First of all, any game that uses real video footage of actors in action scenes to advertise their game, is usually a terrible game.  

On to review key points of the game.

-Bugs-
I have been playing Player Unknown BattleGrounds, off and on since it was first released on Xbox and eventually switched to PC.  So, I have been through a lot of the bugs and failures this game has seen.
Anytime there is an update, something has been fixed and something else is broken.

-Cheaters-
Guys, it’s like breathing air now, you’re always going to have hackers in games, cause some people naturally suck and wouldn’t be able to win without cheating.  That being said there is a lot of cheaters that play this one.  The game does offer a way to report people for many different offenses, and they will notify you via a game message if something has been done about said cheater.

-Game Modes-
One game mode I enjoy playing, is the one that allows you to play against bots and a limited number of players.  It’s nice to get 10 kills under your belt before having to go up against the hacker teams. Unfortunately, your only allowed to play in this game mode three times per real life day.  
Also, there is a training option, where you play a full match against nothing but dumb bots, sadly that is only able to be played solo, and would be better if you and a friend or two could go in and actually ""train"".

-Recommendations to the Creators- 
: There is a level, while you’re being flown into the area the plane suddenly explodes into flames and it seems to be going down (very cool idea), but it never actually does.  Make this plane randomly explode, forcing people out of the plane sooner.  If it doesn’t randomly explode, then it should be allowed to crash into the ground, killing all that were afk immediately.  
: Put all the maps in a set rotation.  I’m sure that I am not the only one sick of playing the same maps over and over again. 
: I need more dance emotes with good music… It’s the only thing that makes me happy while playing this game. Dancing over the dead body of an aim hacker.
: Get rid of the initial lag when going into the inventory menu. Playing a normal PUBG match and it happening the first time isn't game breaking. However, when your playing TDM, getting the lag every single time after respawning over and over and over, is ridiculous. 
: Allow for a custom loadout in TDM, so I won't have to become annoyed with the pathetic lag every time I go into the inventory screen just to make a simple attachment swap. 
: Seeing how you guys have made this game free to play now, you could show your paying customers some love.  Like refunding me the money i spent on this game, or maybe at the least you throw me some loyal unknown player costume, or fancy emote dance, a ton of free coins. Just a thought.

Overall, after many years, a lot of spit polish, you have a fancy looking turd known as PUBG.  
Sound effects are good.
Gameplay and controls are good.
Visual Effects are good.
Replay value is Moderate/high, if you don’t mind being cheated every now and then.  However, most normal people will move on to bigger and better things.

What do I rate this game?                 4 out of 5
Would I recommend this game?      Yes, if you lube up first.

Free to play model attracted alot of cheaters who make a new account after getting banned and ruining the game for existing players. At least the game isnt dead (yet) and KRAFTON is releasing updates regularely. WOuld I still recommend it? Yes, give it at least a try."
18565,Pubg following the same dead path csgo went. I use to love this game before it went free. Just look at csgo when it went free.  There's already enough hacker in game when it was p2p now its fp2 imagine what 5/10 game would feel like running into a hacker once every 4-5 games.

18601,good
18602,"I don't really have the words to describe how back in 2017 how happy this game made me, this is THE game that made me fall in love with the battle royale concept in a game.  Compared to Fortnite, etc my preferred flavor for this type of game is realistic, gritty, ""Battle Royale"" style like the novel, ""Hunger Games"" if you will. 
TL;DR I love the battle royale concept, and PUBG let me immerse myself in it.
*sigh* 

I have to be honest, the cheaters in this game, at this point, have prevailed. Those hacking,  r**ar**d f****ing cancerous piecces of s*** have actually won, and this game totally belongs to them now. 
The infamy of this game holds true from the very beginning, no matter how low your rank is, it could be your first PvP game and there is like, a 1/10 chance that some @$$hole will blow up the drop plane and earn 99 kills and then from there there's like a 50% chance that you'll encounter some d0uchebag with an aimbot who will smoke you with headshots from across town. 

I used to love the thrill of hyper-realistic survivalistic combat, but its just gone. It's a game that belongs to those who know how to exploit it. I still believe it can be fun for certain people, especially if getting picked off by an enemy you will never see makes you laugh rather than get mad, but for me and likely many players, it's a total buzzkill simulator. The rounds take so long, so exchanging bullets with another player is kinda the whole point, but seriously you'll have more fun against a bot than someone actively trying to win because seriously, 80% of the time that player will be running either aim assist, wallhacks or downright aim-bot to make sure that happens, and the devlelopers aren't doing anything to stop them exccept MAYBE banning them for 24 hrs when they're blatantly obvious. 

I cant recommend this game to players like me who rely on strategy and twitch-shooter instincts to play this game simply because it's not truly a survival game anymore, it's more like a party game at best. The game takes too long to play and every gd game is just a doomsday clock until you run into the player who's in it to ""win"" and is shamelessly using one or more of the MANY
 -VERY- accessible cheats to do so, and I'm if you're like me and that's not the way you play, you're just doomed, no matter how talented you are, and that's just kinda f***ed up in my opinion. 

PUBG in the manner I grew up with it is now only available against bots, and the bots suck, so seriously, don't even let it take up room on your hard drive.

And ffs, do your part to end the cheating epidemic, ALLOW other players to have a little fun and play fairly and report everyone who's getting 80 kills per death, they're ruining the game industry.

18625,I guess this game went free to play because its broken. Any movement from mouse and resolution inexplicably drops to its lowest. never seen this with any other game and from my hour of reading forms its an ongoing problem that nobody is bothered to fix.

18653,"Would I recommend this game? Yes, but with a few caveats: 
- Bots make up anywhere from ~70-95% of each match
- Drastic skill level difference for new players, as most players are level 500
- Map variation from match to match is for the most part okay, although Vikendi and Paramo nearly never enter the map cycle
   Most of this is just part of the natural life cycle of a game this old. The skill difference is not too bad for the most part, but I highly doubt a player under level 150-250 is going to win a match, let alone consistently win. Despite these issues it's still fun, especially in Duos or Squad matches and for a free game I'd reckon it's worth the 40GB storage."

18683,"Woodle Deluxe is a cute and colourful 3D action platformer ideal for children and adults alike, and third game in the Woodle universe series. I'd score it a decent 8.5 out of 10 for great family fun. It includes two modes of play; i.e. single player and a local cooperative mode, where the second player can play as Woodle Beaver. It's a nice relaxing platforming adventure with no time constraints and is ideal for all the family. You can wander around in an open world environment, but don't wander off the edges of the world, otherwise you are transported back to the beginning of the level.

It may also be possible to play with a friend online with Steam, but I've not tested that option. When you first boot the game up, a small window appears that indicates that you can play cooperatively, both locally or online.; however, I see no option in the menus that enables the online option???

Of the 40 Steam reviews currently available (as of 29th April 21) for Woodle Deluxe since its release on the 18th Feb 2021, most are positive; which is a very good sign and bodes well for the games popularity. Personally I'm not big into 3D platformers, but I actually really enjoyed playing this in short bursts of around 40 minutes. I found the game entertaining and very easy to play.

The difficulty level lends itself to the younger player, though older player who aren't your usual platformer aficionados' will also benefit from the simple controls. There are eight distinct worlds to explore from snow covered environments to deserts all floating in the sky. You can zoom out using the mouse wheel to get an idea of how big each level is or zoom right in to be up close and personal. This ability also enables you to see the area's you still have to explore. The game reminded me of that brilliant 3D platform game that was released about 15 years ago called Atmosphir, which sadly died a death due to the way it was funded (you paid a monthly subscription, but got the game for free), but the very playable client is still available online for free HERE, but the servers have gone. Still, you can create your own 3D platform worlds that look as good as this game.

My son loved this game when it was still in development and won an Atmosphir Tee Shirt for winning 'level of the week' . Literally hundreds of levels were submitted by the community at its height as it also includes a level editor. Sadly Woodle Deluxe does not include a level editor, which in my opinion would make this an even better game..

As you progress through the levels you can unlock various items and clothing to dress your character in. You control your Woodle character using the WASD or the arrow keys for movement and Space to Jump. To swat enemies with the leaf you pick up at the start of the first level (when you enter your home), use the left Mouse button. If enemies hit you with their projectile weapons before you manage to swat them, you will be send you back to the beginning of the level, but you don't lose the berries or the fairy tears you've collected. You have to collect a specific number of berries and fairy tears to progress to the next level. When you get to the end of the level you'll find three white cups, which you have to fill with the fairy tears before being transported back to your home; where you'll find a new world has been unlocked. Just approach this to be transported to the next level.

There are several languages available, which can be selected from the options menu. e.g. English, русский Russian), Español, Italiano, Français, 日本語 (Japanese), Português, Nederland, Deutsch,中文 ( Chinese), Türkçe, Polski, Dansk (Danish), Svenska (Swedish) plus two others one an Arabic language and one a Far East language (couldn't figure them out in the time I had available for this review)

You can change the resolution from 640 x 480 at 75Hz to a maximum of 840 x 2160 at 60 Hz, with six quality settings from Very Low to Ultra. The difference between the lowest and highest quality settings presents itself with shadows and shading, with the lowest setting having no shadows etc. You can play in either a window, borderless or full screen mode. Changing the resolution from the highest to the lowest will reduce the size of the window when in Windowed mode, if in borderless mode the size of the game area will adjust to the resolution you have set the game to and the sides of the game area will appear black; this also depends on what type of monitor you have. With multiple monitor set ups the game will open in your number one monitor.

Overall this is a very laid back platformer that is simple to play. Some of the obstacles can be a little tricky because you cannot change the camera viewing angle (it would improve the game play experience greatly if the developer added this to the control mechanics; usually the middle mouse button held down allows for changing the viewpoint in some games); however, once you've mastered the movement, it is a very minor issue. It took me several attempts to ascend the waterfall area in level one to the highest levels, where you complete the first level. With eight different environments, this should give you easily a good three or four hours or more of game play, unless you want to speed run it. For someone who is looking for a laid back experience, or one they can share with their young children, this is an ideal starter game. I'm not usually into platformers, but Woodle Deluxe was a pleasure to play as there was little in the way of any stressful game experiences (apart from when I overshot some platforms and fell into nothingness before reappearing a the beginning of the level.

I used to love this game in its glory days from early access until it has become a free.
Expensive shop, trash matchmaking and useless updates made it worse.
And under the pressure with the battle pass and valo's night market thing you can destroy that once loved game.
I still play it but only 2 out of 20 matches are victorius. Why? Ask those devs with their matchmaking."

I played both PUBG mobile and PUBG lite; which is a mobile port for the PC and for some reason This is the most unstable, Cluster fuck of glitches and badly optimized Version of them all. The gun play is so bad; shooting a bullet from an AK while having a compensator and standing still or even crouching, makes you feel that you're shooting two RPGs each in 1 hand while being in mid air (The recoil is abominable). Thing like the concept it self doesn't go well for the map you wait 1min for a match to drop after 3 min and even if you won. you get 4min of fighting against other players in a 40min match. playing another multiplayer fps or battle royal game will be better at least you don't get addicted to something you hate"

Would be worlds better if we could level the latency OR have more casual games for people with latency above 150ms.

18902,"Thoroughly an enjoyable game.
Started playing when it was completely new, and it brought me into a world of FPS gaming that I had no idea was this fun.
Even with all its bugs in the beginning, it was genuine and amazing entertainment. 
Getting back into the game with the bois now, eventhough some say that Super People is better - which, in my opinion, doesn't have the same charm.

Looking forward to see what the game improves and implements in the long-run from now on."

19070,"Is this game a little old? Yes. Is it obvious that it's a little old when playing? Yes.  PLEASE get past that though.  This game is made for people that seek really good gun play in a shooter or BR.  There are no janky building mechanics, or broken guns that you have to find in order to have a good game.  PUBG absolutely focuses on getting good at the gun play and outplaying people with good strategies.  The guns all have recoil WAY more aggressive than most other games I've played, with pretty brutal bullet drop, and creates a need to develop muzzle awareness.  After getting over the learning curve, getting a kill in this game is way more satisfying than any other BR out now.  One of the biggest highlights of this game is the anti-cheat.  When PUBG went free to play, I assumed that hacking would become a huge problem that wouldn't be met with much response.  I was very wrong.  There have been several occasions that I've been playing the game and come across a blatant hacker (tracking through walls, snapping aim, getting kills even when not shooting, etc.) and reported them after spectating.  Each time I've seen a blatant hacker I have received an in-game notification letting me know that the account has had a 24 hour, or permanent ban with an hour.  It's the most responsive I've seen a game with cheaters, and it outperforms most modern BRs when it comes to cracking down on cheating.  Now that this game is free to play, it is the PERFECT time to give it a try.  I highly recommend it."

Make sure you bring a group of friends to heal each other and watch corners. You're starting out playing with level 1000 players who all show the max level at 500. They like to hang out in casual mode where the bots are because they can't hang in competitive or something. The admins don't ban for long enough and because it's a free game now, cheaters just start a new game profile at level 1..... So don't be surprised when someone smells you in the corner of a house and their gun auto-spins directly locking on to your position. Posted Feb 25, 2022."

19258,"I really enjoyed this game... emphasis on the ""ed"" in enjoyed. As of late I've found PUBG to be a rather unappealing way to satiate my appetite for gaming. As such I have looked elsewhere for a fun, action packed, battle royale shooter. I have discovered a game known as ""Fortnite"" and have since purchased ""The Battle Pass"" I have had NOTHING but fun since then. I still yearn for PUBG to better itself in the future, but for right now I'm cranking 90's and capping them vicroys."

19261,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."

- Random Disconnects / Crashes without knowing why the game crashed
- Long load time (Why would you need to load for 20 mins)

In short, DON'T EVEN TRY THIS GAME. ITS FREE CUZ ITS DOGSHIT AND NO ONE PLAYS THIS GAME ANYMORE"

19347,"I can't believe I deprived myself from this jem all these years. I thought about buying this game several times over the last years but each time I felt discouraged after reading the many reviews from players complaining about the rampant cheating going on in the servers, among other problems. Maybe back then the cheating was a real problem, I don't know.. But about a month ago decided to give the game a chance because its free. I mean, yes, somethimes one get supicious of how fast they kill you but for the most part I don't think cheating is an actual problem with the current state of the game. The game has a lot to things to improve yes, but if you take the time to learn how to properly play it, its going to bring a lot a enjoyment in your life (a lot of frustration too, but for the most part its enjoyment). So, the game in february 2022 is a solid 9/10. I hope it just get better from now on. Legendary Counter-Strike level of classic."

I have divorced my wife, sold my dogs, and live in a starbucks coffee shop lobby just to make sure i have peak internet performance to one day bump into him again and throw the digital hands...

19388,incredible concept. easy slam dunk for a company. but these guys have the biggest failure in gaming. complete chaos and to be honest you can see the whole thing is completely gotten away from them. its a complete shame. i only hope a capable company buys the franchise and saves it from these people.

19478,"to much lags, disconnecting from server. Unstable, 
waste of time, you are waiting for match and boom disconnect from server, doesn't make any sense at all."
19479,"Bad design that incentivizes low effort gameplay like camping and hiding in corners, just hide and play the edge and you're guaranteed to end up in the top 10. On the other hand the matchmaking is bad, it matches 8k hour sweats vs 30 hour noobs, in addition most matches are filled with bots to make the game easier for new players but all it manages to do is kill the tension of the match and not make you care about winning after you killed your 6th glitched out bot."

Edit:  The aimbot and esp have taken over.  Time for a new game.  Every now and again I will get a response that so and so have been banned from my reports.  It's still not enough.  Auto lock through walls, esp, you name it.  This seems to be the standard when you let the Chinese play on any game, and then make it free."

Also, if you want to watch someone play (to get a feel for what you migth expect), go search for ChocoTaco (laidback playing style) or TGLTN (competitive) on youtube. Halifax, Swagger is also a couple of streamers that's worth mentioning. 
Have fun!"

19782,Its free and fun to play. There learning from PUBG Mobile and PUBG New state.
19783,Yeah it's alright
19784,"Me and my friend were trying to play this unstable pile of crap, we couldn't get into a single match because the game kept crashing for no apparent reason other than terrible design and coding.

0/100"
19785,If you want a simulator of your game freezing and then crashing this game is for you!
19786,"Game was not worth the 30$ before free-to-play. Free-to-play has made this game worse now with more hackers and bugs then ever before. Prepare to be killed behind cover over and over due to the terrible system they use to deal with differing connection speeds. Played this game for years to play with friends and have hated every second of it. If it wasn't for friends, I would've never played it. If the arrogant clowns at PUBG would ever listen to their customers, they might be able to make this game worthwhile, but they never will. Once they have your money, they don't care about you. They only care about selling skins."
19787,"So any bugs, crashes 1/5 games. Absolute crap stability (only game in the library that crashes). Micro transactions make me think that there is no respect for the players. ALL THEY WANT IS YOUR MONEY!!! developers are shit people...

Apart from that scathing comment, the game play is addictive and fun and good to get in with some mates talking crap (hence the ONLY reason i have put in so many hours)."
19788,useless game waste of time
19789,./
19790,"if it was possible to put stars from 1 to 5, I would put 1, there is no place for beginners to breathe, in 10 matches with people I killed only 1 person, 4 times I simply could not run to the safety zone, because while I ran to it, such the feeling that the game twists 500+ lvl players for backpacks of level 3 and normal guns, no matter how much I watch streams 1 minute of battle they have top clothes and guns, I will screw up 3-4 at home I have a grenade and a backpack of level 1. the game suffocates newbies, probably that's why it became free because the game sucks (not in terms of graphics, but in terms of attitude towards newbies)"
19791,"other than microtransactions, its massively improved over time. I have more fun with friends"
19792,wasted money
19793,its fun if you like tatical fun shooting guns play pugb.
19794,"Now that its free, its worth"
19795,no
19796,goodgAME
19797,fucking shit ton of loading screen bug
19798,"keep scrolling! had the game for years, paid for it and now its free, full of cheaters and crashes constantly. 

also a REQUIRED training before i can play with friends... bro i did my training when there was one map and 6 guns. dont waste your time what a joke
***EDIT***
i still mean what i said before and it is annoying as hell and there is still cheaters but they suck so bad you can out play them. some patches i can not load the game and some times the game crasher a little less because it feels like it. play it but dont spend any money on micro transactions fuck these idiots that bought it from the OGs. obviously playerunknowns battlegrounds: battlegrounds sounds great GG chi chi. on a positive note aside from random crashing and the ridiculous cheaters it runs smooth at a high framerate so at least that part was figured out."
19799, nice.
19800,too many cheaters chinnese haCKERS
19801,Generally a pretty fun time. Being forced to play through the training part was a bit annoying.
19802,hell yea i have boner to just die in this game but damn tho tryhard people are a shit ton in this game
19803,nice
19804,Among one of the worst propositions a free game could ever make: forcing players to spend hours in AI matches. For what purpose? What data are you collecting that makes it profitable for you? It's a shame because the game at 4K Ultra is drop dead gorgeous. Uninstalled.
19805,gg
19806,Fun free game.  A more realistic Fortnight.  A slower much improved pace over COD.
19807,"the tutorial si so boring, remove it please"
19808,shit game. dont buy it.
19809,Footsteps so loud that it forces camping. Final circles are just who gets screwed on rotations cause again everyone can hear you rotate in. Fights are not that satisfying when you can recover 90% of your health in a instant.
19810,Fun but the recoil goes crazy tho
19811,Super fun. Especially with friends
19812,"

19815,"200+ hrs and they milk me to play the tutorial 
made my dick soft

8 hrs- bring back all around open chant n maybe ill do a thumbs up
"
19816,"Easy to learn, I am awful but still enjoy playing alone and with friends."
19817,I LOVEEE ITTTT

19821,It's fun and free!
19822,Now or never ;)
19823,unless you like playin with hackers dam near every game i wouldnt play this game im so tired of reporting hackers EVERY!!!!! GAME!!!!! and its really annoying and ruins it for the players who aculty get pretty good at this game... would be a cool game if so many BAD Players could do better than cheat...
19824,Very pubG yes :-D
19825,"Why the hell do i need to play 10 matches with 100 bots if I already played this game thousand times before. Wanted to get back into this game, but the fact that I cant play with friends until I play 10!!!!!! AI matches is ridiculous"
19826,"First battle royale I ever played and it got me hooked. PUBG has been one of my most played games for years now, and it's only improved."
19827,keeps crushing
19828,No wonder it's free
19829,I like the graphics and physics of the game but please increase the health of the player.
19830,you know
19831,banger
19832,"Nice that it is fro free now, gg everyone."
19833,warzone better
19834,:)
19835,"This is my first game that crashed 2 times in a row while playing the first match with my friend, i couldn't evne get to the second zone. I tried to reconnect but meanwhile i was taking damage because of the zone and it crashed again. I play many games but none of them crashed this fast this many times."
19836,"Good shooting game, but game is not optimized, so fps drops and game looks very bad and unplayable."
19837,"What is up with the graphics?  I feel like I'm a little drunk while playing.  There's no crisp lines, everything is slightly blurry.  It's like being stuck in a 19th century impressionist painting.  This makes hitting targets in the distance a challenge sense they only appear as dark blobs.  I checked my graphics settings and everything is set to ultra.  Until they make the graphics better I will be uninstalling it."
19838,"Played this game before on Xbox one S and PC. After all this time you would think Krafton would of realized that having a filter on who gets matched with who is a very good idea. Because as a casual or new player you aren't ready for the FUCKING LEVEL 500 PLAYER that is going to clap your checks out of nowhere every. single. round. Seriously, I'm lvl 30 and I don't even die from anyone low lvl now. It's always me moving from cover to cover than out of nowhere I get shot and it's always a lvl 500 player. This free to play is just a last ditch attempt to get new people to come spend money on DLC. Safe to say I think this is a dead game."
19839,"Obviously the game made a name for itself...but the non-die hards like me who just play from time to time.....
The FORCED TRAINING MODES GUTTED THIS GAME . Worst descision ive seen a already sucessfull game make, gg uninstalled i cant be bothered"
19840,very little ass rape
19841,bugs everywhere but kinda fun overall it's better now that it's gone free to play
19842,Find out for yourself
19843,They really renamed the game Player Unknown's Battlegrounds: Battlegrounds. They ATM machine'd their own game
19844,"The game was already a bad experience despite slight improvements in how it runs, but now after 165 hours you have to complete a tutorial and play AI matches to keep playing the game like you've played for over 100 hours. The design is just bad, seems like everything in the game revolves around the lootboxes and the in-game store. On top of that, it got stuck in the new privacy agreement screen.

Do not get this game if you care about anything else than the lootboxes in this specific game. I made the mistake of originally paying for this game and I lost that money for no return."

19856,Addictive and graphics are amazing
19857,Game forces me to 15 training missions suddenly after 400 hours?  Uninstall.
19858,yes
19859,"This game would be more fun if it wasn't filled with garbage lvl 500 players who are just so fucking scared to do anything they starts hearing steps and they just instantly crouch in the corner like little babies in an apparment and starts calling their mommy for help.

Wish they added back the map selection so I don't need to play these big ass maps that takes ages to finish."

19869,"Nestabilna hra. Moznost pripojit sa naspat do zapasu je sice pekna po crashnuti hry, ale casto zbytocna."
19870,GOOD!

19874,great game. lots of cheaters still and bots need toned way down. like to see it  that bots are only used to fill a lobby if it can't get filled by game start. overall still a fun game after all these years

19885,"this game is basically dead apparently. For those who say CSGO is dead, try playing this game. I thought by being free, this game can be helped. But no, all you get is Bots.. and some Chinese players who doesn't want to speak English. Try it yourself."

19892,"What a f**k up!! after seperating myself from the cheat-filled PUBG-Lite and buying this, its still giving me headache after not playing it for 2 years. After installing this game again, its crashing at tutorial. Yeah yeah, i'm sending the report to the ""engineers"". Is this happening because: 
- I'm using icue software?
- Vsync on or off?
- Playing in fullscreen or windowed

Who the heck knows, I'm furious!!!.

UPDATE. After deleting C: \ Program Files \ Common Files \ UNCHEATER \ and enabling UAC (i had disabled it using winaerotweaker) it somehow works now, i just finished tutorials."
19893,too many hackers.

19900,pretty good
19901,this game is pretty much a battle between hackers who need aimbot no recoil and your location at all times because their penis is so small winning a game that gives no rewards makes up for them being losers who will never feel the warmth of a vagina
19902,"This game now feels really cheap with all the bugs and the hackers as well as the general quality of everything.

It does have some of the funniest features tho like driving a car at 0.1 MPH pretty much downs anyone..."
19903,"I mean...it is just not my type grinding for a f-ing victory once of 30 matches. I may not be good at MP games, but this..oh, man...I see it is free now. Still, it is a bit too expensive. Jokes aside, go try it, it won't hurt, but idk, if you are not a try hard type of person, you will quit after 3 matches, i assure you. Quite badly optimised, toxic community, hackers from time to time...The upside is that it can be fun *SOMETIMES* if you play with friends."
19904,"Instead of fixing game bugs how about we make it F2P cause we already made enough from this game. 
This is just another hacker zone now for cheaters.
Was expecting alot from upcoming game now just buy DLC to play new season with new bugs.

19956,"Both the only milsim and battle royale I like. The stealthy tactical combat is just so satisfying.

Edit: Well the devs are doing NFTs, bummer. I'm not going to be playing it if that remains the case."
19957,Fortnite is better because of the Green Goblin skin
19958,"This game sucks, unfortunately, it is fun"
19959,50/50 chance to run into a cheater..so can be fun at times...WHEN IT ISN'T UPDATING...I've never played a game that updates as much as this and it's peak gaming time for east coast US.
19960,Bring back map selection and 10/10
19961,good
19962,GOOD
19963,nice game
19964,"This game is absolutely terrible. It has been terrible for years and unfortunately I don't see that changing. Movement is beyond bad, updates don't actually fix much, and the graphics have only gotten worse? US east servers down and game completely unplayable every Tuesday night during peak player time for ""maintenance"". Its really bad, but the trashiness adds to the experience in a way. Its like a welcome home.

Just be aware nothing will ever get better and the developers couldn't care less about you. Its a money grab. Accept this, and you will put in a few hundred hours and have some great times with friends."
19965,"This game currently after ""Free to play"" unenjoyable at all, Especially at the morning like at 8 am- 1 pm it's just morning of cheaters lol, Full of new accounts with no skins and most of them cheaters, 5-10 games in a row dying against users with level 50-4-20...It's just sickness!...Playing this game at the morning is dead for me...You are just a gamer baying skins and you spent so much money on your gaming stuff for a better performance and dying against 5-10 mb cheats! lol

The anti cheats like ""battleye and EAC"" they are the same milisha who's making cheats,hacks or it's completely garbage >> choice one!
When a cheater finally got banned, that cheater will use a software to change hwid and then free steam account+free to play! >> Easy come back and repeat!

And For ranked you have to pay to play it. But ranked in this game is not for me and not for everyone
And for my opinion ranked in this game is the most boring game i have ever played, No experience at all, and i never touch it, You have to rat/camp in the name of ""surviving"" to get more points for ranking up ""And that's your skills!""...And if you shoot at a player, Every team will appears from their holes and shooting at you at the same time from left,right and your back lol, just camping/rating skills! (You need RNG and coincidence to win! )

The only ranked skill based game without a doubt is counter strike and games like this. And i will not be surprised if ranked in this game got removed and it will be better.

My last word, This game shouldn't be free to play ever."

19974,"For being a game that was a massive international phenomena, This game is TERRIBLE. It boggles my mind how this game consistently gets so many active players with the low quality graphics, sounds, mechanics, and slow gameplay. I used to go on pubg binges on my phone when it was blowing up but that was well over 4 years ago , but the fact that the pc version isnt any better quality despite not having hardware limitations, almost no improvements on the game have been made in favor of focusing on cosmetics in all these years, and is headed by a shitty company.  You want a good f2p shooter? Play Fortnite, CSGO, Apex, Warzone, Valorant, should I go on? For a game that has been such a hit for so many years as well as being a paid for title most of its life, this is shameful. This is not worth your time. I should not be playing a game that has had billions of dollars flow into it, and it having the feel of a small indie dev trying to make a low budget free fps game for their 100 yt subscribers. The space has gotten much more competitive and if you want to keep your market share, FIX YOUR GAME."

Just tiring to get matched vs sweaty 500lvl players when you don't even have 100 hrs in the game, on some computers getting constant crashes, getting stuck in the rocks because of their bad hitboxes and last but not least- useless death replays, because when you watch them, it looks like the enemy was shooting behind you but its because the replay mixes up your enemies ping with yours so mostly its just a useless thing when it comes to detecting aim assist or wallhacks by replays, and still all they do is add more skins and gamemodes..."

Current state of PUBG (performance) - it is well optimized, controls are fine, lags are minimal (comparing to Beta when it was out of hand with everything).

I still recommend PUBG, if You have time to waste, at least Ranked matches are good (and there is like 80% less cheaters).

Overall, if You like BRs, give it a try. =)"

It's a very fun game, nice details and a whole different gameplay.
What I do miss, you can't play ranked games without paying for it and it's very hard to get free stuff, like new outfits or skins for weapons. 
It could be so much more and this game is really lacking that part. 
That's why I would give it 7/10. It could've been 8.5/10 or maybe even a 9. The game just gets boring fast without (free) ranked matches and without collecting outfits and other stuff."

20326,"Gave this game a go recently, due to all the popularity it enjoyed over the years and the fairly impressive competitive scene on Twitch.

Pros:
- Satisfying gun, looting, and BR mechanics

- Large maps allowing for strategic and methodical play, instead of pure boom-and-zoom like certain other games in this genre

- Compelling inertia-based movement and parkour

- Very fun having fights with legitimate players

- Replay system is novel and educational

Cons:
- Cheating is completely, utterly out of control; the amount of boosted level 500 accounts running around with 100% perfect awareness and recoil control and pre-aiming is asinine (let alone the more blatant idiots that just stare at players through solid objects and don't even make a slight effort of hiding their cheats). The difference between fighting a legit player and a cheater is as clear as night and day, but the anticheat barely seems to pick up on any of it. I would hazard a guess at least 30% of the players I encountered were cheating to some degree, with the majority using more 'subtle' levels of location awareness and recoil reduction.

- The cosmetics are absolutely terrible. They look awful - nurse outfits, clowns, neon colors, ""K-pop"" clothing, trash that even Fortnite does better - and the systems to obtain them are even worse, a fresh hell of lootboxes and 'resources and blueprint' collection and 'crafting' (mostly through exorbitantly priced items in the game store only available for RL-equivalent currency). It's probably the worst cosmetic system I've seen in any game yet. A new player has little to chance of obtaining even something basic that they actually want without spending a large amount of cash. This is one factor that Super People does much better.

- Sounds are not reliable. People can be running in near proximity to you on a hilltop and you won't hear it; they can be on the floor of a building right beneath you and sound like they're walking on dirt outside; gunshots can sound like they're next to you when they're hundreds of meters away.

- Q/E lean spam is stupidly easy to do and stupidly effective at literally dodging bullets without impacting aim much if at all. It's not Call of Duty tier of cranked movement shenanigans, but it's still annoying that something so simple and silly-looking can be so ridiculously effective at making it hard for enemies to hit you.

- Grass & bushes are deceptive, and more often hinder your visibility far more than they make it hard for enemy players to see you, much of which is evidently due to the draw range which can be reduced by changing a graphics setting.

- Physics and movement leaves many things to be desired: aiming out of windows or over ledges is often wonky, exiting a car that is supposedly stopped can still be lethal, descending a somewhat steep slope can result in a sudden 'falling death', etc.

- The game only allows you to enter a training/practice mode against bots 10 times. It's possible the custom games allows you to play against bots more, but I didn't feel like investing the cash to buy Pubg ""Plus"" in order to find out.

- AI bot behavior leaves numerous things to be desired. This thread I feel gives a good rundown of the topic: https://old.reddit.com/r/PUBG/comments/st3hha/lets_talk_about_bots_and_how_to_improve_them/


Overall the experience was frustrating, because the core gameplay can be very rewarding - but it's disrupted by blatant widespread cheating, and the horrendous cosmetic system, which makes the goal of 'progression' a moot point."
20327,Really enjoyable game. Really good idea and gameplay. Absolutely love the shooting mechanics and ability to plan ahead with the zone. But there is still too many bugs. The game is crashing too much and it takes too long to find a game. Still my favorite game tho.

20345,"I once saw this tiktok about this guy who picked a game called puba G over Hyper ekas ekas ekas ekas ekas ekas ekas ekas, so i gave it a try. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, when you log in people throw apples at you and dance and I just think this is very innapropriate for a game like this, NOT only that it gave me pstd from school... (NOT GOING TO GO PUBLIC ABOUT IT BECAUSE OF OBVIOUS REASONS). -DM if you wanna know @regis._.cash on insta."
20346,very fun battle royale i like more than apex
20347,yes

20360,It fun
20361,"Too many crashes. I've installed the game 3 times now and it keeps crashing and telling me to verify my files. I've done that over 5 times alreasdy and it keeps happening. Maybe it's just me, but either way just dont bother with this game. There are much better BR games out there that are worth your time and effort. Even without bugs it's not that good tbh."
20362,Well I've played over 400 hours and I still want to play it so....
20363,fun game
20364,yes
20365,"i keep dying to level 500 players named ""BangedYourMom69"" in the top 10. I love it though"

20367,Solid game!
20368,hahahahaha pretty fun for a free shooter yay
20369,i buy when money. Now free :(
20370,"Played this game since Beta and enjoyed it for a very long time (obviously). But now the game is F2P, which exasperates a lot of very big problems previously there with PUBG. Let's get down to specifics.

-Hackers and Script users

This has always been a problem, make no mistake the reviews arn't just trolling. The majority of the time before it was F2P, they were somewhat rare? Certainly not going to ruin your night, maybe 1 or 2 in 30 hours of game. This is perfectly reasonable, you can not catch them all. HOWEVER it has been a DRASTIC change since this game has gone F2P. Weather it's budget cuts, or the increased volume of players, the way it has been since the update to F2P has been downright unacceptable for a shooter of this size (reference steam active user counts). You guy's really need to address this, above anything else I list here.

-Frequent game crashes

Title says it all here, doesn't matter if someones shooting at you, you're driving, or just walking in the middle of nowhere, since the F2P launch the crashes just keep on coming! This alongside a very noticeable dip in server stability in the first 5 minutes of a match, which is HORRIBLE because that is one of the most important times NOT to lag.

-Corrupted Files

This one has happened to me twice now since the F2P update and good lord is it a huge negative influence to bearing with your game. My patience died today after Today's most recent 2 updates, my Resource files were corrupted and you have the audacity to pop up an error message asking IF I KNOW HOW TO FIX THE ISSUE. Are you serious!? So not only do I have to reinstall the entire game, after a 2 hour update already, but you want me to fix the bug for you. No, i'm gonna pass. First time I had a corruption issue, all I had to do was some relatively annoying trouble shooting and got it to work, this time however is not being so generous. 

-Match Making

Ohhhhh boy. You would have thought the match making would have improved with the huge increase in player base? Absolutely not. You will meet one of three types of people in PUBG, a F2P noobie, a lvl 500 diehard fan of PUBG, or a hacker. One of these problems can be solved very easily, stop matching my friends who are lvl 25 against people who are lvl 500. It's pretty simple really, no one likes to be outclassed by a sweaty nerd who probably thinks you're a bot and provides zero challenge to them. Squads especially are a problem because of this, stop pairing the lvl 500 players with lvl 12 players. They never stay in the pre-game lobby, thus making the team uneven.

This game still has so much potential to be better than this, it is the reason I have over 1000 hours played. Some of the best Battle Royal shooting in the industry to this day. You have absolutely nailed the gunplay. But for heavens sake, you haven't even fixed the ""invisible"" rocks that send you flying off your motorbike to your death after 5 years, why should I believe things will get better? 

NO I would not recommend this game at this time. It's always been hard to recommend, but when I did I could say I had faith it would get better in time. I no longer believe that."

"
20372,yes
20373,It's fun and all but my only complaint is that I can choose the map I want. its free to play so what do i care.

20375,"Your classic battle royale for better or worst, always fun to spend some time on it with friends."

20387,"What began as groundbreaking has devolved into the utmost trite, overhyped, and unfulfilling nonsense. Hackers in every match. Monetized transactions abound. Most updates come in the form of new outfits and decorations so you can resemble a weeby K-Pop band rather than stronger security or better mechanics. Longstanding issues don't get touched. Devs are here to make money, not build an enjoyable game. As someone who's played since beta, I can say with confidence this game has done nothing but gone downhill."
20388,good game

It has One huge draw back I started out on controller and as I learned it has somewhat of an input/response delay compared to using mouse and keyboard so if you use controller like I did I would recommend trying to learn M&K its not as hard as I thought it would be. They have ""Casual"" Matches which are AMAZING but only limited to 3 a day which blows because its 12 people and 88 bots so you can really learn guns, map, recoil, etc. Overall its fun even slow but like many games I think its better with friends."
20636,I paid money for this now it's free to play. This is just going to invite a lot of hackers into the game because they have nothing to lose.
20637,"been playing since released on console.  I was excited to swith to pc oct 21.  Game kept kicking me back to desktop and resetting pc every hour or so.  Didnt matter if I was in game or in menu.  I picked up a new hard drive so tried a fresh windows install and with different gpu too and still same issue.  I built a new machine altogether with new cpu, motherboard,hard drive, another different gpu and still same exact issue.   Ive tried many things and cant figure it out.  Only game that gives me problems and use to be my main game.  RIP pubg"
20638,Best realistic battle royale.
20639,"Very Realistic, fun to play, and even when I die I honestly don't get mad, I can play this game on end for hours, I'm in love with the first person mode because jesus it's fun."

20644,"its a decent game other than a hacker here and there you cant complain really, there's not much bad things i could say but there are definitely pro's and cons as with everything else..."
20645,"I'm old, and i am not good at this game. I am more into surviving to the end. But the game it self if just lovely, most players are good run, unfortunatly, there is always a grifter to remove the fun out of a game.
But that happens less and less. It's a good shooter, harder then the mobile version, but so much better details. I payed for the ""plus"" and I do not regret it."
20646,Chicken Royale
20647,"You can't even play the damn game.
You get past the first level of tutorials, then...
Magically, you can't play because ""all servers"" are down.
Uh...That update was on the 12th.
Pretty sure today is...NOT the 12.
If they were still updating, why make it even playable at all, until the updates are finished? Makes ZERO sense.
So, since that's about 60G in total. I'm dumping it from my computer."

20651,"The OG battle royale game. Started what has fast become one of my favorite game types for shooters but launched with a whole bunch of jank and animation, UI and other quirks. Years later and it's now free to play and most of these issues have been fixed and the game runs very well and looks pretty good too. A breath of fresh air for those who tried other BRs like Warzone or Apex but ultimately just want something that's a bit purer and more about survival with more realistic weapon dynamics and gunplay without any super powers, crazy gadgets or distracting gimmicks."

20662,"Yes, I recommend this game to others because it is a beautiful game and i love the mechanics. The only weird little thing about it that took me a while to figure out, was when I first downloaded the game it had this crashing problem. I thought it was that the game was buggy but then remembered how long this game has been out for and knew there had to be a solution. Due to how good the game was I continued to play it for days even though it would crash 5 times a day so i finally got tired of putting up with it and looked up how i could fix this and i read in an article online that one could uninstall and re-install the game to possibly fix the problem. I tried everything else and ignored this step because i felt too impatient and lazy to perform such task, but after a couple more days of the crashing problem i finally gave in and decided to uninstall and re-install the game and voila, problem solved!

Movement is clunky
Gunplay is okay
Server match making is garbage
Anti cheat system is garbage
Not a welcoming experience for new players

Not to mention me and my friend just want to play, we want to duo. EVERY TIME we go against full squads of four and it just get ridiculous. They have no duo option, and the servers don't match make to your level so a level 20 is going against level 500 people. Overall all the cons just make it a bad experience. The only fun you can have is full squading and somehow getting better at the game while you get destroyed ever round."

20720,"My friend thinks i am trash,
so i just deleted this game.
Thanks TrueEagle for motivating me to not play this game :)"
20721,"This game is dying because of thousands of bugs and cheaters in every single game, because of very bad decisions (bots in lobby) and taking away options from gamers (choosing maps). After so many years still so many bugs. I paid money for this game and now I wouldn't even get it if it was free."
20722,"If I'd written this in 2018 when this game was at its best I'd have certainly recommended it but in its current state in 2022 I'd have real difficulty even considering its F2P release. When it first released it genuinely felt like such an exciting game, no game really had the same feel to it, but then the Battle Royale genre started to expand and PUBG was really just left in the dust as other titles had something new and exciting which this just didn't. Admittedly, PUBG has always maintained a kind of quasi-realistic shooter vibe but this is hard to believe after so many years. PUBG was at its best early on as I said when it a pretty bare bones grungy survival shooter which thrived on its addictive simplicity. But now its just declined into a fairly forgettable battle royale among many despite futile attempts by developers to revive any life it still has left. No addition since Miramar have felt meaningful, cosmetics and a season pass have just made it blur into the plethora of dead-beat ""live service""  games and F2P was really just too little too late. There is no way the developers could expect people to pay for this game in 2021. As far as gameplay goes its okay but isn't anything special, its like whenever PUBG does something at this point another game does it better. In short, PUBG has seen much better days and if you're looking for a battle royale try it, you've got nothing to lose except the time it takes to install, but its far from its 2017/2018 glory days."

20753,"Not even joking, the worst 2.7 hours from my entire life. No wonder this so called ""tHe OrIgInAl BaTtLe RoYaLe"" is free now, as it should be. I'm really sorry for all the people that wasted their money and mental health on this crap. If you really want depression but at least, get some sort of fun, try League of Legends. This PUBJoke is not worth your time, trust me. 
But if you still hate your life that much, here's what you should know:
- the map is so big, yet, you will pray to find some fight
- walking simulator
- marks are not working, so you'll have to constantly check your map to see if you are dropping correctly
- crappy textures that even CS 1.6 would totally beat, yet the performance is DOGWATER
- do you want to jump a window? Nah fam, you will get glitched on some object for no reason
- you will pray to god to find a vehicle, otherwise, walking simulator again
- the sounds are ass, you throw a nade, you'll hear the explosion sound 5 minutes later, and what the hell is that smoke nade sound
- the entire game looks like puke
So if you have no b**ches and you hate your life, play this crap!

Edit: I'll still give it a try and play it with my friends, but no, I'd still not recommend lmao"

20818,"This has probably been my favourite game the last 2 months, I have played it non-stop both solo and with friends. I honestly find it hilarious to play it with my friends, cause we just mess around and then suddenly get murderised. However, not gonna lie I think I’ve made one of them hate me cause we keep trolling each other lol. Then again they do deserve it so it’s justified. At one point I was just listening to Runnin’ Down A Dream by Tom Petty while playing solo, literally just running around with a Thompson Submachine Gun not paying any attention to people around me. Then I suddenly see we’re only 3 people left. I ended up coming second ‘cause I accidentally threw a stick of C4 and blew myself up. In terms of playing with friends, messing around it and not really taking it seriously is extremely fun… Except when you get Team Killed because SOMEONE wanted to drive the car you found. But to be honest I do the same so it’s all in good faith… Except when it isn’t. One of my friends and I also had a frying pan fight to the death to see who’d get to use the emergency pick-up - he got knocked out and killed by the storm."

20869,"Hello! On behalf of the participant of the Windows Insider Program, I inform you that the launch of the application on Windows 11 is difficult.
If you encounter a driver error ""xhunter.sys"" it means that you do not have an anti-cheat and cannot start. 

Go to the system anti-virus settings and find the kernel isolation setting. It is located in the Device Security section. If you can't control this setting, the game can't be launched at this time. On the other hand, if you can disable the setting, do it before installing and running the game. However, as soon as the game is installed, turn it back on, because this is an important functionality!
The problem will be solved with the update of the anti-cheat system. The update date depends on the software developer and is unknown to me. Hope my review helped you

3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

21022,"OK, here is the deal. I was playing, crossing a bridge and got shot on from the distance. I was trying to avoid the shots by running left to right. Out of the sudden the game started lagging and I was not in control of my movement. The lag stopped after about 1s but something very strange happened: my character started moving randomly and I could not do anything besides watching how I am getting shot at and inevitably die. My pc is not high end by any means but I can play other shooters just fine without this things happening to me. The fact that this game is still around after around 5 years and I get this problem is making me very angry at the devs. I heard about players hacking by doing this type of stuff on other players but I do not think that is the case. To be fair, if I was the target of a hacker which could mess up my movement it is even worse than the game being not optimized. I hope one day this game will become great again but it definitely seems like today is not the day."

Always delivering on the fun & it's free. PUBG is the game you will delete other games on your SSDs if need be with only little hesitation. I must have spent 2h total fixing bugs and optimising the game. Not okay.


Edit: 
Biggest and most recent issue is a memory leak causing stuttering & freezing.
If you encounter such issue:
-> Download EmptyStandbyMemory 
Find a guide to set it up and it will frequently clean your cache.


Edit: Memory could not be written. My  crash report is in Chinese,

My son got this game for Christmas in 2020 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

21224,"PUBG Ragegrounds. Good design, crappy engineering. The game is packed with cheaters. There is an instant replay and so you are forever catching jerkoffs as they stalk you through walls or snipe you even through dense layers of grass occlusion. You'll also see guys who are aiming way above your head and off to the side and they spray into the air and all the shots hit you. Were they cheating? Is the game's network replication shit? There's no way to tell. But in theory, the replay should be flawless since it's playing back events without any latency or missing packets. There is massive mouse lag even at 25 FPS, where you can shake the mouse back and forth and watch as your view wiggles out of unison. Perhaps most pointlessly and unnecessarily infuriating is the handling of the ADS command. Initially, I assumed maybe you have to be standing really still, just because it seemed so particular and erratic. I just played again, hopefully for the last time, and noticed that it has nothing to do with your movement. There is less than like a 50% chance that the game is going to pick up the ADS binding because it insists to be as hair-pullingly rage-inducing as possible. And then there's where I ambush some guy with an LMG and he just turns around and shoots me. That's garbage. That is hits simply not registering.

This game is hugely overrated and its popularity is inexplicable. I assume people like it because it's well designed, but unfortunately it plays like ass from a practical perspective. I would play COD Warzone instead, if my computer were up to it."

21252,"I had a really bad time. There are so many cheaters which was a downside of making it free to play but the upside was I didn't had to waste my money on this piece of crap. The mechanics are flawed but it is comforting to know that they are the same for everyone but when you throw cheats in the mix there is absolutely no point in playing the game. The really infuriating part is that when you die and sometime you click on the death to know the cause of death the game loads forever and does not show how you died which cheats a player out of reporting the cheater who killed them. It is still broken and there is absolutely no joy in playing this game. If you have not played this game try it, its free to play and I am sure you will agree. Or if you don't want to bother (thanks for understanding) the quick rundown is that you spend 20 to 30 minutes building yourself up to get 1 shot by a cheater."

That other 10% where you get a game that isn't ruined, it is awesome, but until they can figure out a way to get the cheating under wraps, it is unplayable unless you can look passed getting killed cheaply every match."

21335,"PUBG is a ""military simulation"" battle royale game. As a mil-sim BR, it plays much different from Warzone, Fortnite, and Apex. The biggest difference is mobility. You can't slide or fly or glide around, you are human and run/walk most places like in Tarkov. There is higher weapon recoil and more realistic bullet physics than Apex. If you want something more arcade-like as a superhuman play Apex or Fortnite. If you want something more realistic play PUBG.

Cheating allegations are overblown and much better than the past, PUBG is on par with any other battle royale game regarding cheats. I've played over 100 matches and reported people for suspected cheating twice. This is mainly hyperbole by morons who don't understand how the game works and display their ignorance on the discussion forums.

Performance wise PUBG is less optimized than games from big studios like EA or Activision, so if you want a smooth 120 FPS at all times with no FPS drops, maybe try something else. The game sometimes fails to boot from Steam's Big Picture mode, but I've never experienced one in-game crash. Personally I have no complaints about the performance it plays perfectly fine for me.

The biggest problem I have with PUBG is the developer Krafton's puzzling design choices. They split the game into third person perspective matches (TPP matches) and first person perspective matches (FPP matches), effectively dividing the player base in half. Why? Why divide the player base by FPP and TPP? This is so stupid, they are trying to please everyone and only end up making the game worse.

The matches are filled with bots so out of every 100 players, at least half are bots. This is not ideal and makes the game less exciting, but it's understandable why they do this so that you can always join a match easily and it's honestly not a huge deal.

All in all I definitely recommend the game and think it's fantastic, however at the end of the day people have different tastes and this isn't everyone's cup of tea. Personally I think it's a great game and was the mil-sim BR king for years, but it does have flaws.

21342,"I decided to come back after the game became free to play. Saw some streamers playing it. Nostalgia.
Downloaded 45gigs, installed, went through all of the settings, keybinds, ui, etc.
Can't play the game until I complete ""Basic Training"" and ""Three AI Drills"" or ""10 AI matches"".
I have 2700hrs played in the game. Are you seriously going to make me do unskippable ""basic training""?
PUBG, you've got to be flipping kidding me. Goodbye, now forever."
21343,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

21370,"This was a great game for a long time. Since going free to play (f2p) in 2022 the servers are full of cheaters in casual and new multi-player modes. Previously logged thousands of hours and VERY RARELY encountered issues with cheaters - now, it's been over a month and you can't escape them it's every other game or so - real obvious stuff based on kill cams; walls, aims, etc. Can't recommend PUBG any more as a result.

Before the haters complain ""you just got naenae'd by a better player"" I've logged many, many hours on here. It's pretty damn obvious, and the timing lines up with the F2P changeover... Unless the sudden influx of level 5 players following you with their reticle  through the wall of a building in replays,, from 200yds away, then flicking headshots, they all just happen to be esports pros who ""discovered"" a 5 year old game."
21371,"Despite going through some rough years since launch full of cheaters and horrible performance on almost any system PUBG still sits among the other top BRs on the market.
Now that it's free to play and has a functional anti-cheat and runs smooth on most computers I can recommend giving it a shot!
Just don't play solo unless you like getting sniped from random directions"

21449,This is the first BR I played when it was first released in its early stages. I played it on Xbox and I absolutely loved it. Since that time I always come back to it. It's simple but great. They've constantly added more to it over the years and out of all the BR's out there it is still my favorite. I enjoy the small details such as when you are close to a wall your gun lowers instead of sticking through the wall. Now with it being free if you haven't played it then give it a try.

And in the arcade, it is the worst. I get killed by players of level 500. Are you serious. How am I suppose to  play this game. Earlier I was a fan of  this game because I used to play it in mobile.

I'm talking brazen, flat-out, no-possible-way cheating. PUBG implemented the new zakynthos cheat system. The other day a buddy and I were playing and a dude snap-killed both of us. We reported him. A ban-confirmation message came back saying the guy was banned.. for TWO DAYS. Wow, thanks guys. Thanks For nothin. Zakynthos is not working. Gonna have to uninstall again.

21554,I don't want to give negative feedback for the game I enjoyed playing for a long time. I can put some bugs aside. But it's very frustrating to see many cheaters. They just automatically aimed like using aimbot in our last few matches. I pity those people who use it. Image how miserable your life must be to use something like that to have some pleasure. Terrible. I hope you will do something about it.

"
21654,it very good
21655,"Bad things:
Player balancing is awful, I'm always getting into a lobby with people who are high levels that are level 200 to 500, low levels that just started playing the game. Tryhards and sweats are the people who are high ranked but I do see low ranks be like them too. Sometimes winning (miraculously) but usually losing. Cheating isn't that much of a problem here because for some reason, not a lot of people cheat in Asia servers, well, for me. But I do see people with suspicious aim and little to no recoil. PUBG became F2P which means more hackers.
Good things:
PUBG is still a game that's at least somewhat entertaining and fun when you win. Playing it with friends is much more fun than queuing with random people. If your team can communicate, you have probably more chance of winning. 
Conclusion:
Don't get it. PUBG, please build a better cheat engine so that your game wont be bombarded with thumbs down and remove microtransactions.

Also this isn't really for the review but, I bought PUBG for my OG Xbox One, and it was horrendous playing it. Everything was so slow, laggy and awful. Playing it on a gaming laptop was much better than the Xbox One. Good thing I switched."
21656,Yes.
21657,Its free now. What can I possibly complain about.
21658,"It's okay.

Wish they'd remove that ABSOLUTELY RE-TAAAAAAAAAAAARDED limit for AI-bot Matches.

Other than that, it's pubg, it's free, just get it.
Even if you're anti-social like me and just want to do the AI matches;
burn through the AI limit and uninstall. Still worth it.

21713,"Should have an auto-refund option for people that have less than double digits in play time, like myself...... 

As much as I wanted to like it, lets be honest it's janky as hell compared to some other FPS games. The characters are stiff and slow to react and the animations for the character feel unnatural and again slow to react. The graphics are pretty poor by today's standards, hell, they were poor for Dec 2017 and they've done nothing to fix that. In fact, apart from a couple of questionable map designs have they ever actually added anything meaningful to the game? Lets be honest, if it didn't have some pseudo z-list e-sports celeb attached to it, it would never have garnered the interest it did. And now the Developers are desperately trying to squeeze the last few drops of life out of it by making it Free-to-play in the hopes it'll boost it's failing player base. 

Normally if a game is free to play I'd say; Have at it! Give it a shot! What have you got to lose? But in this instance, save you time and hard drive space. With the amount of coverage it's had with Steam highlights/YouTube vids/Twitch clips etc. you've seen absolutely EVERYTHING this game has to offer, which isn't very much to be honest. There are plenty other fps games out there that are better and do the whole battle royal thing better as well. Without Player Unknown's name attached to it, this would have been throw in a dumpster fire day 1."

21727,"There isnt any logic to matchmaking... level 1 with level 100 together...

The items you find also don't have any logic and to a degree that is ok... but when for example there are 2 houses and 1 player gets to 1 and the other to another one might find it full with weapons and the other with ZERO(like the painkillers do u any good against a shotgun[not even a shield]{in some there are to many in others there are none}). Or for example you find 2 backpacks of the same level in the same house, or 2 backpacks in the same spot of the same level and the examples can go on. Or if u end up to far from a building and the other user gets to a weapon before u YOU DON""T HAVE ANY WAY TO ESCAPE!!!!(only if u encounter a really bad player)! Why don't u fix also the shield ending up for example over the compressor how would u want me to see it although i need it.

Why did u even make the train if u can't even get inside it, u just die!!??????!!!

You even can stay if u are lucky in the exact same spot until the end of the round without doing nothing for over half an hour then go and kill the remaining players or and end up dead by a cheater or a sniper or a car or etc... 

Team game it's NOT that bad but good luck when the game lets u play alone against all the teams..............................................disgusting......... u dont stand a chance when they gang up on u!

There are a LOT of players with AIM/DAMAGE cheats! You really need to fix that!!!!! They should have their steam account banned for a year and the game should be able to be accessed by new users only if they`ve purchased a game.
Also I don't know if the armors work like they should 100% of times because sometimes it's to hard or to easy to kill a target with ~ same gear, or maybe it's the cheats of the players... who knows...

Just test your aim in training sometimes the gun fires a lot further then the point target! That is ABSURD! I really don't know what is making the weapon sometimes fire so badly.(and it's not about RECOIL, the shots are fired 1 by one after a period of time)

AND THE SHOOTING FROM INSIDE BUILDINGS IS AWFULL the aim target has ZERO meaning from where u try to shoot!!!!!!!!

Deathmatch 8x8 is even worse! If u walk u're to slow if u run u can't shoot cause the bullets are all over the place... and the delay of the mouse and weapon is a disgrace altough I have a lan connection with HIGH internet speed, it doesn't even show who killed u and there is no highlight over the killer and u dont even know from where the killshot was and if there are users with cheats u just die randomly... there should be multiple spectate options also... my patience is over with this..

And for the love of GOD I don't know why but this game feels so slow in comparison with CS... it's like I press a button and it takes almost 2 seconds until the character moves............. and the recoil is a disaster watch a video on yt for the love of GOD to see how the recoil of a weapon looks only morrons get their weapons in their faces.............. are the devs that did this kids?

Zombie mode... well just a bunch of dudes on crates and rocks... u'll understand after u try it... it makes u fell sorry for the zombies... 

I'm sorry I will probably go back to CS.

The game is GREAT taking into consideration it's nature and the level of improvements from the past days(thx for that) especially since now its FREE but the experience is almost really bad. Since the level of excitement is under 50% due to all these II can't recommend it without a warning that it will test your nerves more then your skills, because after u invest almost 1h into only 1 gameplay and you end up dead because of lag, a bug or a cheater without the possiblity to respawn due to its nature that is not ok.

There are some bugs for example I got stuck near a rock because I was on the limit of the force shield on the last 2 players and couldn't move at all. There isn't any warning or any notice on how or at what speed you can get out of a moving car you just might end up dead.
Also you need to make more maps that are harder for snipers to use because on a bunch of them u are a sitting duck without any ability to cover in open field or any ``weapon`` to defend, and the smoke doesnt help at all you are blind also. Oh.. and it crassshes a lot...

MOST IMPORTANT
THE TEAM  SOUND CONTROL when I press escape IS USELESS IT DOESN""T WORK THE crazy kids are just screaming like crazy!
You don't have any stats about your killed targets like how many shots hit, what percentage of damage what body part. You really need to have a look at the old CS mods for real...
And REALLY? there isn't any knife in this game?! :))) that's sad :( although it`s impossible to get on someones back with all that noice(not absolutely impossible)[I don't want to smack him with a frying pan]
You need to add an icon or hint in the invenstory to which weapon each ammo or gear is used more so if the weapon is in equiped cause nobody knows all those gun names especially new players, beginners are here to try the game not learn a quiz in weapons and gear for real...

I hope to be able to change this to a thumbs up some day sooooon...."

21737,"You read all these reviews of people angry that the devs are giving the game away for free. People wanting freebees is not the answer. I'm not trying to make a generalized blanket statement, but I feel the devs should have at least been more transparent to earlier players of the game. Personally if I knew the game would be f2p in a couple years I wouldn't have bought it. I mean just look at my playtime. Also it's the fact that a lot of people asking for money back are those without disposable incomes where every dollar counts. $30 is enough to buy food for at least a little while."

21934,you will most likely die to a sweatlord or a cheater . The recoil for you is set to maximum but the damage you deal is equal to that of sneezing on the other guy . You will get shot from a mile away and get killed with one hit but your bullets go as far as your breath before dropping like a sack of rocks . Also for some reason bullets go at the speed of 1 mile per month . Dont waste your time

+ Different match selections: solo, 2 player teams or 4 player teams
+ Casual mode (some AI players)
+ Some small maps for quick fights between two teams
+ You can collect custom clothes for Your char
+ Drivable vehicles with different seat places
+ You have some time to revive Your wounded team-mate
+ You manage to survive in the storm some time
+ You can find modifications for Your weapons during the match
+ You can carry at the same time: two long distance weapons, one pistol and one melee weapon like a cooking pan
+ Steam inventory displays Your collected item skins"

3. Net-code that leaves a lot to be desired.

The company doesn't give a damn f on this, since there are enough people / whales out there buying the DLC/cosmetic bs each season.

I had fun with this game, but most of the time it was cracking me up, annoying me to the very borders and i played it because of friends too, but this is over now. I will never give this company a chance again. They can stay with their core base, which is mostly asian cheaters, and go back to the cave where they crawled from.

22086,"this is such a shitty fucking game, I have no idea how the fuck people paid money for this game. It relies entirely on fucking vehicles in order to avoid the storm, walking is a complete impossibility. It could be excused if you could actually see vehicles on the map or airdrop/similar in order to give yourself one. There are USELESS props which look exactly the vehicles except in slightly worse condition than the working cars. I walked around for 30 fucking minutes trying to find a SINGLE FUCKING CAR and when I eventually found one I was too fucking far gone, I had survived for 3 goddamn circles inside the storm, you cant even get to the next circle without dying. Another shitty part of this game is the fact that it goddamn FORCES you to take the tutorial and disables casual mode unless you play 10 fucking matches or do 3 shitty goals."

I love this game, but i like playing people that i know more than playing with randos, yes its still wack but its more wack when you have someone that you can co-op do some wacky shit. Im still recommend this game because in all my times playing this game ( ie when its not f2p ) i havent gotten shafted with hackers all the time, most of the time there are just people who are good/better than avg players. Y'all guys that saying there are hackers are just butthurt that they have more skills than you. And to all first timers, try it this game is good super good"
22092,Going F2P doesnt change the fact the game is still ruined by the same problems since early access. Asian playerbase playing on servers they shouldnt be on and rampant cheating. This whole plus nonsense that they ripped off from CSGO doesnt save you either. Honestly go play something else then this overated POS.

For whatever reason, the editors didn't really think about it, and continued to use footage with the twin towers still standing for this scene; however, they aren't there in his original universe. Therefore, something that Kermit did in his life, did in fact cause 9/11 in Muppet lore."

Played my first Battle Royale match ever...was ripped to shreds by someone who is Level 500. (Literally...Level 500.)

I think a game can be considered flawed when it doesn't allow for players to grow and become competitive. Throwing a First Match, Brand New Player...in a match with people who have clean over 300 hours of playtime is ridiculous, and will only lead to discouraging new players."

Had some frantic moments which were fun and made the game fun to play and why I kept coming back, BUT currently, I can't really play the game. It keeps crashing every match. And I don't mean a crash in terms of just closing the game, no it crashes my pc, forcing me to force a restart, every time hoping for no files to corrupt in the process. If that error should disapear, I will give it a positive feedback, but as of right now, nearly unplayable.
And yes, I do meet the required hardware, my friend can play wihtout any crashes with similar (slightly worse I think) specs. I also reinstalled the game, underclocked my gpu und banged my head on the table, nothing helped so far."

22145,"PUBG is a typical example of mediocre/bad devs with a great idea. They made a poor excuse for an indie BR and then rested on their laurels, seeing how much they can bully their playerbase with terrible decisions until they abandon them. They made the game free to play and they still couldn't convince enough people to play it so that they can re-enable the map selection. That should tell you enough. I can't see any reason as to why anyone would play this after 2017."

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

22210,"It definitely worth a try now, I have a lot of fun. Two things bothering me right now: Firstly, the amount of bots is incredible. I know this game is hard and as a new player you need this achievement of killing a player but I face 5 bots out of 7 enemies. Even worse is how the bots act, they don't even shoot you, they just moving in a circle waiting for you to kill them. 
Second thing is the updates and love from the developers. There is none. I get it, PUBG Mobile makes so much more money and has more players, but when you have a PC version which is now free so there are a lot more players, you need to provide content and updates. There are no cool weapons skins right now and they think a map rotation and a new shop counts as an update. 

Despite these two points the game is really fun and grinding it is enjoyable. Try it out if you haven't!"

22278,"I bought this game during the first release. I disliked the game, even tough I got chicken dinner multiple times with multiple try outs and challenges facing against bots and cheaters in every solo game. 1 in 3 every player you meet in matchmaking will be hacking. 

The game is also unfair to the deaf people. There is no accessibility for deaf people. As hard-of-hearing person I use hearing aids to listen to sound the PC streams to me, and it is mono. I noticed there are footsteps are clear, most professionals use it as well I use it. But the game have no accessibility for the deaf people, unlike Fortnite (has a way to display the sound graphically). 

PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS has a lot of different game modes to play in matchmaking. Solo, duo, or quads. 

Lately there are a lot of hackers and cheaters that ruined the game since it is ""Free to Play"". Hackers take advantage of it and abuse the ""Free to Play"" system. Be vary and think twice about buying this game."

but, the battle royale 'only the first place person benefits' structure of the game is just boring. 

wish they would add more game modes, different things to do - NPC's in the world / objectives...anything to break up the monotony of battle royale bullshit. 

after whining that fortnite stole their game design, you'd think they would look at what epic is doing and learn some stuff, but apparently not."
22291,Good
22292,I'm Stupid
22293,Just don't like the game.
22294,"I want to give this a good rating I really do because I've played this game quite a bit over the last year and a half or so since I've owned it and I have had fun on this game before. However this game has been completely ruined for me by becoming free to play. I understand it's a knew way to bring more players to your game except it has just been an easy way for  hackers to just remake accounts over and over it seems. Now that people are able to create accounts over and over because it's free there really isn't a real way of stopping it unfortunately. There IS PUBG Shield (which you have to make an account with to even begin your attempt to report someone) but the hoops you have to go through just to get a proper report out there is kind of ridiculous. Then once you do it's not even really any moderators that see it it's other players that vote on it. Which actually can be pretty good but it just seems like they're very ""hands-off"". The in-game report system is pretty much useless and even PUBG has said so themselves that it's not very effective.

Also free to play bringing more players to the game and we still haven't added Duos back into the game for TPP? They made the game free and so everyone who already paid for the game got an outfit for only the female character (which you CAN place on both male and female but you know what I mean) at the very least give us an outfit for both male and female I mean we paid for the game and it's now free. There were other things given to us but honestly it really wasn't worth what we paid for the game. At least in my opinion not at all. Basically everyone got the outfit so it's not like it's this super special rare outfit. 

Casual mode seems like a game mode where if you are a beginner you can learn the ropes and to an extent that's true. If you don't count the max ranked players who play Casual to get easy kills/wins on low level players because there is no level cap for Casual. Also you can only play 3 Casual mode matches a day?? Which I can assume would be extremely frustrating for a new player trying it out for the first time and getting clapped every game by an extreme try hard lvl 500 with gold medals feeding off new players and then they're just out of Casual matches for the day. They do give you bots to fight against as well as a small number of real players in Casual though. However the bots are so incredibly mind numbing and stupid there is almost no challenge whatsoever which is not rewarding at all and doesn't really help you learn the game. I mean how are you supposed to learn how to survive against higher levels when most of the time the bots are standing completely still waiting for the blue zone to come kill them. Which honestly has an almost eerie sadness to it watching these bots just wait to die lol. Or they're walking back and forth stopping and turning around etc. Popping off a couple of shots at you from long distances or really close up but hardly ever landing a shot. Higher levels aren't usually that bad with their aim at all.

Also I don't know if they are bringing ""Survivor Pass"" back into the game but there is also an achievement for leveling up your Survivor Pass past the max rank and Survivor Pass ins't in the game anymore either. At least we have PUBG plus. 

I used to like this game very very much but it is just getting so old and becoming less and less fun. (ESPECIALLY after it has become free to play) I can see that the devs are sorta half trying like with the Discord giveaway, the Epic Fails contest, and the incredibly cheap rip offs of Power Ranger outfits but I mean seriously even the daily check in thing isn't working properly."
22295,nice
22296,very fun but crashes at random sometimes
22297,"A solid battle royale, though doesn't offer anything drastically better than current ones out right now. The only real drawback is how unoptimized the game feels."
22298,"pretty noice game for playing with friends
"
22299,"Absolutely worth playing. I most just play training against the AI bots to avoid hackers. Even though the AI isn't that good it's still fun. I'm surprised it's free to be honest. I thought for sure this would be at least $20 USD. I'll take a decent free game any day of the week. Especially if it has decent graphics, good gameplay, AI support and a large community to support it. This game passes the test in all those categories. I do like the battle royale. The biggest problem with games like this one where you can have like 100 plus players on a server is that the maps are usually so big, you can go literally hours and not see a single person. I used to play a game called Unturned. The servers in that game (at the time, the server are far larger now) were small. Like 24 people per server normally. But even on the servers with 150 players, the map was so big, and because there was no play boundaries like in PUBG, it was difficult to find players. And of course there were also hacker everywhere. It got to be monotonous quickly and therefore, I ended up not playing the game anymore. This may be my new favorite game for a nice relaxed, somewhat easy to win battle game. I'd normally play war games with factions, but I don't mind a goof free for all every once in a while."
22300,"fun, slow and not frantic like other first person shooter multiplayer games"
22301,Best BR I have ever played so far.
22302,"Crash, after Crash, After Crash.
Then Frame Stutters after frame stutters, I feel that the game was better back when it was a BETA.

The game clearly needs some fixing LOL"

22314,10/10 always loved this game
22315,"The tutorial is super long, I got bored. To sad I just wanted to play the game with a friend and the game did not wanted me to do that."
22316,"Game is rewarding as fuck when you do well, but a lot of the time you do not. Don't get discouraged about dumb shit that happens because most of the time your next game will be you killing someone in some dumb manner. Game is graphically intense on your PC with shitty graphics. Sometimes seems like you cannot see a single person when everyone in the lobby is staring at you from across the map. Mantling and climbing is stupid slow."
22317,"good game

22326,kinda fun after 3 years

22328,Worst game you could ever play! You have to go through over an hour of training just to start actually playing. And that's a big deal breaker to me. I'm not a retard and i know how to play shooter games like come on over an hour to be able to play. Krafton you are pathetic!
22329,"Fun, but still like an Early Access game. Feels unfinished."
22330,i cant say balls in chat
22331,You like getting shot from somewhere and you have no Idea and you scream WHERE?!?! You like your shots landing but not downing someone but they shot you twice and you die. Then this is the game for you. 10 out of 10
22332,good game
22333,Fun to f*ck around with friends.

22339,"I’ve got suspend couple times, even though I don’t use any cheat or any other programs in my gameplay. It’s frustrating to get my account suspended for nothing just because i got reports my account get suspend .

22341,Best Battle Royal of all times.
22342,takes some getting used to but its fun if you got some friends to play with
22343,its fun
22344,best br by far
22345,somewhat realistic and since its free I really recommend it
22346,Best of battleroyal game
22347,fight me in ritual combat
22348,"This might be one of the absolute worst battle royale games i have ever played. This is because the gunplay is abhorrent, i'd wager my bet that gunplay in free indie games released by university students would feel more fun. The maps are huge and if you don't get a sniper with a long scope then you lose. The game and combat is far more fun during the hectic few minutes where the players are in close proximity scrambling for the first guns they can get their hands on. The game runs well, much better than it did a few years ago. but that being said, even on higher graphics the game looks like shit. If you are looking to play a good, free battle royale then play warzone, and if you are mentally handicapped then play fortnite i guess."

22357,"This game was the first BR that got the balance to weapons and armor right, the ring feels like it works instead of allowing others to heal spam outside of it and there are plenty of options to play extra modes and workshop maps for the game."
22358,yes
22359,Classic BR Greatness right here.

22391,very good game for play with friends
22392,"Veryyyy Gooood, Veryyyyy Niceeeee, Winner Winner Chicken Nugget Dinner

Very good battle royal where strategy is important and not just run about like a loony. Endless hours of fun with randoms or Solo and the character customisation is really good, can make the character your own compared to other Battle Royal games.

Another thing to mention there are many maps to play on so each round has something new up its sleeve and that just makes the game so much more fun.

Have fun fellow gamers, Peace"
22393,It's not a bad game.  Use this code 78814-43270 to join up.  It worth a try and it has it's own unique style of gameplay.  The one that started the craze should be checked out.

22399,ok
22400,Refunded this game 3 times in the past. Now that it's free it looks much better than before.
22401,"Loved PUBG from back in the day, a lot has changed since then. I prefer the old PUBG days but its still fun. Used to be infested with hackers but seems better than before so thats good at least. 8/10"
22402,not fortnite.
22403,.
22404,"I've played for over 300 hours, now I have to complete basic training to even go do a match?  Fail."
22405,"Pretty fun if you like limited combat with lots of looting and gathering equipment. The gun fighting is pretty fun. Game play is solid, but tactics give you the advantage. Stick with your team and use call outs and pings to capitalize during gun fights. 7/10 but its free so it gives the game a bump on the score because I didnt have to pay for it."
22406,"as i can see sadly there are way to many many troll reviews on this game, i haven't seen any bug nor cheater, the only thing i dislike about the free version is that you can encounter level 500 players that got no life and are the whole day playing, and also it is boring in solo but thats to be expected, but when you play with friends this game can really be a lot of fun, and surprisingly the game is well optimised unlike before where the game would stutter, ijust hope they give ranked mode to f2p too, to honest be this deserves at least positive reviews, it is not the best game but it is fun"
22407,Wooo!!  Rick Sanchez Approves!!!
22408,"poggers, no building features so little kids dont build the tahj mahal whenever they hear footsteps, 5/5 chicken dinners"
22409,"Yeah..good game when I'm not being sniped out of nowhere,other than that sometimes I wanna uninstall it"
22410,"Still the best battle royale in 2022. And now it's free too!

Matchmaking is fast as there are plenty of players. Some of them are noobs like you and me, so making the game free might have helped to make it a little bit easier as well. It's also super fun!
But enough of this, I'm going to jump in now and get my ass kicked again :D"

22433,"Very good game, sometimes the game can become a bit repetitive within terms of loot, there is some bugs within the game and some of the maps need optimising. Overall though as a free game I would 100% recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a realistic shooter which stays within the battle royale genre and makes it fun to play!"

22523, Grab some friends and murder a mix of bots and people to get killed in top 10 by someone who watches 2 hours of TGLTN clips a day or a lvl 500 who could be hacking but it's hard to tell because BLUEHOLE can't code an accurate death cam.  Somehow this is fun.

Great graphics
Need more optimization on the game some areas..
mechanics when coming to driving are not perfect but great..
overall there are not many bugs, however this game is not hardware friendly this game is demanding a bit of hardware to run this game.

22530,"Even though it's free, I still feel cheated. It's alright, just don't play in public matches, because you'll either run into someone who's lagging really bad or find yourself at the opposite end of a 360 no scope kar shot from about 200m away, after their perfect aim snaps onto you.

To say this game has issues on PC is rather... beyond an understatement."

In the past i selled the main one full filled of streamer skins like Shroud, SkipinhO, Tournament Skins like PGS and also collected 4 Season Passes complete, i did a good amount, dont judge me, at the end of the day its all bussiness.

Anyways, has im saying always love this game, always played it. Some times i make a break and try other games, but in general for me (Personal Opinion) this is one of the bests Battle Royal out there!

And this year, im very happy to see the devs choose to invest on the game and bring it back to live. 

If i recomend this game? Yes

And, enjoy it (Now its Free).

In my 1st account i buyed it for 30€ and worth every penny <3"

They need to lower the level that  is necessary to play ranked or new players will leave the game but the rest of the game its great."

22579,NGL there is a learning curve but about maybe 3 or 4 hours in it gets really fun as you start to really learn how to play and kill people. Actually killing people and winning is such a satisfying feeling. Also this is so much better than games like fortnite because its semi realistic so there is non of that building a whole sky scraper in 3 seconds. Very much enjoy and recommend.

This is one of the worst FPS games I have ever played in my life, full stop. I was going to say frustrating, but the game is in reality just terribly un-fun due to oppressive tacticool mechanics. Playing this game is tantamount to mental torture. If you want to play a game where every match is you dropping in and immediately getting destroyed by someone who has mastered the nonsensical  mechanics, then this is it for you, though. You can shoot someone 10 times, but they will use their G-Fuel aided aiming to hit you once in the head. Then you will get the pleasure of going back to the main menu and queuing to do it again. There has never been another game that I have played in which the entire experience is just nagging frustration. There is no sense of pride when winning, but only relief that you didn't get matched into a lobby with someone with 10,000 hours. The only way to improve in this game is to play for 12+ hours a day for the next 5 years; this is because the folks who are still playing have been doing exactly that since 2017. If you want to become frustrated at how you are spending your time, question if you were ever good at any FPS title beforehand, and overall hate your life, than this is the game for you!"

Its very obvious with free to play changes that even less now is being done about hacking/cheating. Out of every 20 or so hackers and cheaters that you report now, maybe one gets banned. Its obvious that as of this moment. It is pay to win. The hackers are all people who have spent lots of real cash on items. And are clearly being given passes to actively cheat and not receiving any bans because they are still spending money.

22687,"PUBG is a ""military simulation"" battle royale game. As a mil-sim BR, it plays much different from Warzone, Fortnite, and Apex. The biggest difference is mobility. You can't slide or fly or glide around, you are human and run/walk most places like in Tarkov. There is higher weapon recoil and more realistic bullet physics than Apex. If you want  something more arcade-like as a superhuman play Apex or Fortnite. If you want something more realistic play PUBG.

Cheating allegations are overblown and much better than the past, PUBG is on par with any other battle royale game regarding cheats. I've played over 100 matches and reported people for suspected cheating twice. This is mainly hyperbole by morons who don't understand how the game works and display their ignorance on the discussion forums.

Performance wise PUBG is less optimized than games from big studios like EA or Activision, so if you want a smooth 120 FPS at all times with no FPS drops, maybe try something else. The game sometimes fails to boot from Steam's Big Picture mode, but I've never experienced one in-game crash. Personally I have no complaints about the performance it plays perfectly fine for me. 

The biggest problem I have with PUBG is the developer Krafton's puzzling design choices. They split the game into third person perspective matches (TPP matches) and first person perspective matches (FPP matches), effectively dividing the player base in half. Why? Why divide the player base by FPP and TPP? This is so stupid, they are trying to please everyone and only end up making the game worse. 

The matches are filled with bots so out of every 100 players, at least half are bots. This is not ideal and makes the game less exciting, but it's understandable why they do this so that you can always join a match easily and it's honestly not a huge deal.

All in all I definitely recommend the game and think it's fantastic, however at the end of the day people have different tastes and this isn't everyone's cup of tea. Personally I think it's a great game and was the mil-sim BR king for years, but it does have flaws."

22693,"By far one of the worst Battle Royale games. The quality of the graphics are similar to the ones of the mobile version of the game, even on ultra. The gameplay lacks variety and activity as i would recommend changing the game's name to walking simulator. Too complicated shooting and inventory management mechanics and really junky movement. In addition to that, not only did the game used to cost money but also now that the game is free to play, the cheating problem that everyone seems to be complaining about will absolutely get worse as it is easier now to make a new account. Taking everything into consideration, I would highly suggest steam removing this game from its servers as it is just a waste of space and funding, there is no reason to play this ""game"" unless you bought it and feel bad about your money been spent into nothing."

THis is much more a survival, or at least a game to see who can outlast each other rather than a game like FN for example. I personally enjoy the more realistic version of BR games.  WHile third person can be fun. When you're accounting for bullet drop in the rain, but can see around corners of buildings and out of windows that only the light can get through.... WHat's that about? 

Anyways, don't believe the time played. It counts as long as the window is open on my OS, it doesn't need to even be on the desktop. SO it's more like 1/4th of the time it says. lame. oh. Get you a dirt bike and play FPP. that's such a blast. oh man. lol"

       In all honesty i like the game-play and the gun play, and when we can get a match with out cheaters its some of the most fun I've had with recent shooters.

The but is the big problem tho. 
Me and my friends having played well over 60 matches have died to some of the most blatant aim bot/ wall I've ever seen in any game.
From players ranging from the ""level 1 clearly a smurf ""to ""max level 500"" accounts.
Both stutter flicking to your head or following thru a wall

Did you just get killed and you swore you had the drop on a guy? or you have know idea where this dude even is?
 Just wait for the death-cam so you can watch as Tweedledee over here with a pistol just head-shot you and your squad with a Uzi from 100+ meters in one mag
 Or how his buddy Tweedledum  just perfect track hip-fire follows your head thru a wall and out the building

With zero sign of improvement or a working anti cheat there seems to be more cheaters the players in most lobbies

22868,"Bought the game when it came out. Played it for a while, stopped playing it for years and wanted to check in for a couple of quick matches. This was my experience coming back to the game:

YOU HAVEN'T EVEN COMPLETED THE TUTORIAL OR THE 10 MANDATORY AI MATCHES YET! YOU FUCKING CAVE MAN, I BET YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE WASD BUTTONS DO! HERE LET ME SHOW YOU. WHAT? YOU DON'T WANNA???

I just started playing with friends, no two situations are the same.

Either you´re the first one jumping and fistfighting everyone, or you´re landing a lot later to hang back a while.

Sometimes it even feels cozy when you´re set up in a high/safe place with a good gun. Relax, breathe, check your surroundings.
TPP just gets on my nerves, so all of my gameplay is FPP, I get immersed more easily.

Would recommend to everyone to give it a shot, though earlier FPS gameplay experience is helpful."

I wouldn't recommend this game because whoever the game product managers are, are not thinking through anything at all. Why would I be required to participate in AI training + basic game training when I've played 1600 hours? As a software developer myself, I'm appalled that you couldn't even do a simple check to see that I've played this game before. A kid who's programmed for 1 month could do a check that simple"

22913,"This game character mechanic is completely trash feels like drunken snail. The training mode is completely useless as the retarded people try to disturb when you practising, don't know whose idiot idea was to make training mode as public instead on private.

Aside from the fact that you have to play some boring bot matches before you can play pvp, once you're finally able to play against real people it feels like the game is soulless. The map is way too big resulting in you running all the time to the safezone which is most of the times at the other corner of the map. It's basically running simulator and you'll rarely bump into players on the way. I was bored every single minute I played this."

22948,"I guess PUBG will never learn, they make it free to play but match level 500 players (AKA no-lives) with new players. Who cares if it takes them 10+ minutes to find a game... they certainly have the time. You never know how many people will be on your team because these dimwits don't understand autofill. Having all your teammates leave and then going up against a squad of level 500 no-lives, which is really what they are, is not fun and the people who made PUBG should be ashamed. They should be cleaning toilets instead of making video games. PUBG's base temporarily went up, but will soon return to its previous abysmal numbers because of their stupidity.

And to level 500 players (most would be over 1,000 if there was no level cap), go outside and actually get a life."

23031,Awesome game
23032,"Played for a few hours and to be honest its not a bad game once you setup the controls to your liking. However the matchmaking of the players is rubbish once you move out of training. Nothing beats going up against people who have 100 hours on the game against someone who has just started. I know I'm crap at the game but at least match me with people of the same level. I can see why people may call cheaters but its just the skill gap and its the grand canyon of skills gaps. It takes time to learn but when you get taken out in the first 5 min by a headshot from 400m by a level 100 you never get the chance to gain that experience. If you want to start out on this game now its free, good luck. Also tried team mode and just got slated constantly for being a noob. Other than that the game seemed good."

23134,"Having about just enough of the bugs, cheaters and bad design. I play about once a month since like february, and EVERY SINGLE GAME I run into cheaters. Right now, I got killed by a guy which sounded he's right in the front of me, while the whole time he was somewhere else. I went into the lobby, and the replay button is completely missing, even after restart. F*CK BLUEHOLE STUDIO. It's the worst technically executed game I have ever seen. From like a year 2016/17, they made an unbelievable amount of money, and the game is still the f*cking same, only like what... two new maps, which look like an 8-year old kid was playing with the editor. I would SO much like to see, what they are actually doing with the money they are getting? It's just not possible they are working there. Btw, you can see they don't even bother buying a bit more servers, because in like 70 percent of modes, the matchmaking is just infinitely long and the game never starts.
This game was like accidentally good, because of Brendan Greene, but in every other way it's a DISGRACE TO THE VIDEOGAME INDUSTRY."

23152,"I hate to say this, but do not play this game due to the amount of cheaters, empty lobbies filled with bots.
If a game goes free to play, its because the developers want to catch all the people who have stayed away with it and lure them into the game which is basically at EOL (end of life) 

I played this game for a entire year and a half at release and it was some of the most fun I had ever had.
Over time the developers adopted things like Battle pass and, smaller maps and cosmetics. Essentially a way for them to gain more money while at the same time not doing anything with it other then releasing some bug infested maps and run some stupid tournaments to promote the game.

if they BLUE HOLE (which sounds like a sickness you get from wiping to much) would spend time fixing anti-cheat rather then uploading the game with seasonal updates filled with only cosmetics, we might actually have still have a good game. 

The state if development and the way all video games are going is a model in which to make you pay for access, and them make you pay for content. 

I all honestly and I REALLY REALLY HATE TO RECOMMEND AN ALTERNATIVE like this...
But,
You are safer playing Fortnite and spending your money there on cosmetics there, then playing this trash heap.
The community is full of real people, EPIC GAMES is highly invested in Fortnite so there are basically no cheaters. You will if at all never see one. Not to say there are none, but its a hard thing to be one there.

The only other thing I have to mention is that Battle royal games are done with. No one wants them anymore and they are over saturated messes that eventually lead to bots and hackers filling the lobbies."

IF the devs can find a way to deal with the widespread cheaters and this game becomes playable by non-cheaters again, PUBG is an incredibly fun game. All this potential is wasted by people that are using aim-bots and x-ray. The only way to compete at present is to become part of the problem, so I'm uninstalling and walking away."

The game can be really unforgiving, but there is not a single game that comes close to the satisfaction of getting kills in this game, let alone winning a game. The gunplay is not like anything else and is also very hard. This combined with the downtime between gunfights makes this a great game for chilling with friends. There is also a lot of freedom in what types of fights you want to do. Winning with only 1 kill whilst being stealthy or getting 15 kills and going in like Rambo. It's your choice."

23291,"So I was finally Qued with a stream sniper. Dude pointed where to drop, a minute in he notices a streamer is in our game(not a coincidence). I am not aware of the popular pubg streamer's. Dude starts to say I need to kill him, ""In order to be the best I need to beat the best."" I tell dude to elaborate on what he means by that. Dude says that this individual has won multiple pubg tourny's, how he needs to kill him. I tell dude so you mean to tell me that if you kill him you'r basically taking his crown?!./ Dude says that's exactly what I mean. PATHETIC!!!!-To know that this is what drives snipers to do what they do along with ip grabbers and all the discord haters. This is by far the worst sort of validation anyone can seek online. I felt bad for this individual who was being targeted.  This individual was clearly a good player and was clearly having a casual game. I chose to not participate in his plot and ran straight into an enemy without firing. This targeted individual is clearly a great player. I tried to express to Dude that even if you kill him doesn't mean you are better, he may have days/rounds where he wants to enjoy himself meaning he wont be in a TOURNY MOOD!! For instance if he wants to own he could probably flip the switch in his brain and shut down the server/ this is draining no one plays at 100% competitive mode, it's exhausting. Dude couldn't face the fact and insisted on going after him. long story short he failed. Clearly a pathetic human thinking he can take someones hard work by doing scummy things. Please be a bigger person and actually put in the work and get good. Even if you resort to being a pathetic loser and go through pathetic ways in order to target an individual it wont make you better it makes you worse. cheaters will never prosper!"

23398,"i hate this game so much

this is the worst game i played (for money) (i didnt paid)

but also this is the best game i evre played (for free)

Graphics: call an ambulance 
Gameplay: somtimes maybe good sometimes maybe shit
Mental health before: i have friends 
Mental health after: i still have friend but i dont want to play this game
difficulty: depends on the situation (bots are the best players ever like ever or im just bad)
  

rip for all ppl who buyed it but now u can destroy newcomers in br 

overall:  

Best game for free i would recommend if u rage very easily dont even click the download button u will kill ur pc if u do it 
definitly try it sometime 

parror"
23399,Good game... As other say there's lot of cheaters this just isn't true or I never anyone yet.. You have masters in the game who really play good.. but even I killed once a guy with headshot 330m+ away

23404,everyone is level 500
23405,"the problem here is the game has now been out for over 2 years and there just making it free now ???
new players have a huge disadvantage and every game me and my friends get into someone is cheating, weather it be walls or a spinbot, aimbot, speed hack or whatever else. I wish i never paid for this game in the first place the learning curve is pretty difficult compared to other BR games, but now its full of cheaters and sweats in normal game modes. TDM is the only good thing this game has going for it ! overall do not download this game if you think its better than Warzone or fortnite its about The same :)"

DO NOT WASTE UR TIME !!!!!"
23415,bad game
23416,black screen while launching game . try everything but didnt work
23417,Game has lots of lags during playing and switching to other connection which is super stable doesnt help. Even better speciality is when it starts lagging and your ping jump to high numbers when there are only a few players even when you have no problems with connection to the internet.  6/10 from me. add: its even more garbage than i thought. add add: game has instaled some actualization and now will freeze when i touch the ground when falling with parachute. I love this game on mobile but on the pc? total garbage

-Daily one crash at least - usually when i am in the final stage of a game
-shitty climbing phisics - the dude canot run sideway and crab a ledge, no no, you must stand 90 degrees inf infront of it and then climb it
-shitty matchmaking
-from 100 players in a match at least 50 are bots if not more than that"

The only battle royale that was big before this was Minecraft Hunger Games and an ARMA III Battle Royale mod. And now it's Free to Play! (Way too late if you ask me, but it's got me playing again so I guess they did the right thing)"

"
23484,"Started playing once it became F2P. One of the most fun I've had in a shooter in a while! (Let alone a BR)

The gameplay and physics are fun and feel rewarding after getting a kill. The lack of ""reviving"" or ""comeback"" really make's the game feel more high risk and high reward since if you die, it's over. 
 
PUBG is slower but winning a match is a lot more satisfying than in any other game in this genre (at least to me).

Game is F2P, can't go wrong!"
23485,"I played Fortnite for almost 4 years and now I have PUBG. I don't know why more people played Fortnite at all, probably because it wasn't free to play but it's a much better game with more options. Change my mind."

23621,very good game recomend
23622,I'm bad at this game and therefore it is a bad game.
23623,Not bad game but biggest issue is having to play casuals as Pubg not supporting low level/duo in ranked and casuals is just full of bots. You literally just see bots most the time until the last 10 players on the map. Also you can't pick a map and only one map allows you the chance to come back alive if you die early which is useful when playing with friend. Apart from that good gunplay and graphics slightly better now but sluggish movement a bit still.

23734,"Step 1
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x9 inch pan or line a muffin pan with paper liners.

Step 2
In a medium bowl, cream together the sugar and butter. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine flour and baking powder, add to the creamed mixture and mix well. Finally stir in the milk until batter is smooth. Pour or spoon batter into the prepared pan.

Step 3
Bake for 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven. For cupcakes, bake 20 to 25 minutes. Cake is done when it springs back to the touch."

Seems like they never changed that game since release, every round seems like a drag if the lobbies even fill up but looting is so bad as well. Scavenging through a house without finding a gun shouldn't be possible, especially them not even being reloaded too. The game tries but fails most of the time, even Fortnite is so much better in regards to quality of life, graphics and everything in general."

First bought and played this game back in 2017 or it's prime age and aside from a few graphical enhancement the technical side of this games are still as primitive as it was back then. Major lag spikes, sudden ping jumps and i know for a fact that my internet is not a contributing factor to that. Game decides to completely freeze and lag the moment a player pops up in my screen. It has been 6 years and the connection stability is still shit, and you wonder why the game is dead. Even with less traffic the servers can't handle a match."
23798,"When you finally get a server stable enough, it doesnt crash as soon as you leave the plane, youre gonna die within seconds, because the only people who still play this are Pros and Streamers.
This wouldnt be so bad, if it didnt take 2 minutes each time to actually be able to start a new match (pre-matchmaking, matchmaking, pointless airplane time until you can actually drop).
Its just a waiting simulator now"

You're in the circle sitting still not moving and then out of nowhere in the dense fog where I can barely see a damn thing. your whole team gets sprayed and you just spent 20 minutes picking up United States Military litter.

Maybe if ranked wasn't locked to level 80 it wouldn't be a problem, but I see no reason why ranked is locked that high. Just promotes more hacking and I'm sure when you get to ranked, it's full of hackers too. The game was fun when it FIRST dropped but now I couldn't recommend this to anyone.

Aside from that it's still the same game it always has been but WAY more optimised and with more features and content. Just my personal opinion but I enjoy it too for the realism of not being a bullet sponge and puts more emphasis on positioning and always has tension. Despite others experiences I have yet to run in to a hacker too"

The performance was horrific at times, the new map wasn't fully optimized, and it simply wasn't as polished as competitor titles, It took a supercomputer just to play the game at a stable frame rate, and that wasn't helping with rubberbanding (when the game jolts your character slightly due to inconsistencies between the server and client) and other network issues.

Feels like devs already abandoned this game already.

24028,If you get into in and tweak your settings so it runs smoothly its actually pretty cool. The explosives are really impactful if used properly.
24029,"Great game, quick fun matches. Always entertaining. 100% would recommend."
24030,"For me the recoil is just laughably absurd I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn in this game with pretty much any gun but a sniper rifle or single round. 99% of fights I get into I lose because the recoil is just insane but everyone I meet seems to have no problem landing shots. I've tried full auto insane recoil burst still horrific recoil but single shot is nice it's not so great when everyone I run into is full auto recoil less it seems lands like 75% of the shots on me at least.

I'm pretty sure the, ""best"" players probably just use some kind of script to eliminate recoil tell everyone else to get good or to practice lol there's no practice needed when you pull the trigger and the character just sprays all over lol. Recoil should be eliminated entirely to level the playing field.

The recoil has ruined the game for me but it's a cool concept. If you're planning on playing good luck."
24031,YES

24076,"Game looks sh!t.
Controls are sh!t.
Takes all my RAM and HDD.

Yet, it does not have a South Africa Server and does not log me on Asia Server either.
You do not have the possibility to choose either.

It seems I get connected to EU French Server A-Z-FRA, is what it shows.

The minimum ping is 250 but you will throttle the 800-1000 ping when playing.
How are you supposed to enjoy this game ?
Since I started it, it has been nothing more than toxic, stress and rage ?
I was lucky not to have the means to buy this game. I would have thrown my money to the Bin.

Hackers a way common but you could still enjoy part of your game, IF, you had a F good ping.
How the heck do you ALWAYS connect a player in the India Ocean, Mu, to an EU server when you have Asia Server right here. 
How the heck does you Region Lock function ?

Sorry, this game algorithm and logic comes from dec ass.
Something so simple is riduculous.

You play Multiplayer on the servers you have best ping, predominately ones closest to you.
How should you enjoy a Multiplayer game with 250-1000 ping ?

A farce of a game.

Other people may have good reviews and I am happy for them.
Yet, not my case. That's the good part of having free access. It prevents you from getting scam.

24108,"Easily one of the worst games ever made. Poorly optimized with clunky mechanics and soporific gameplay, I cannot recommend enough that you don't play this steaming pile of crap."

For those who are feeling same way, I want to say just keep grinding. After you understand the mechanics of the game this game is superb.
I just got my first chicken dinner and it feels amazing!"
24125,dumb that you need to play 10 AI matches before getting into actual games
24126,better than xbox version

24140,a fun time with friends
24141,"Absolutely fun, playing alot of solo vs squads and even managed to get some wins, its incredibly fun with friends, guns look amazing, graphics are solid as well and above all the bugs crack me up haha was floating on my quad cuz of a failed Aerial stunt that didn't finish the animation. There's also Bots (A.I) but it doesn't make the game any worse, there's also plenty of real players in the lobby, i'd say more so then bots. No hackers so far. came to this game cuz a friend wanted to play but slowly transitioning to this game from R6S. What i do have to mention is that this game has insane amount of crashes and the only solution i have found is completely reinstalling the game."
24142,...
24143,2.5/10
24144,Cant even rate the frikkin game because it constantly wants to crash! Cant even get passed the deng tutorials. ._.
24145,fix ur game
24146,ever since the free to play update i cannot get passed the AI training no matter how many i do. i have done 26 matches now and it still wont let me play with my friends on normal
24147,"Tutorial extremamente longo e o jogo te obriga a fazer e a jogar com bot, ai você instala pra jogar com amigos que não consegue"

24151,"Looks very real, takes skill and precision, should've played more of this before..."
24152,"This game goes from bad to worst. Despite the fact that i feel discriminated now for paying those money for a crappy game to begin with, but instead of fixing the anticheat and upgrade it, give it for free now and let the cheaters rule the game. Good job. you couldent make it any wors."
24153,cool
24154,free ??? where is my money ???
24155,"It's honestly just a bad game. It's extremely clunky. Strafing, looting, climbing all feels extremely bad. You have to spend around 200 - 300 hours adjusting graphic settings to even get the game to where it looks remotely good. I really can't see any reason to play pubg over Apex or Warzone honestly.

EDIT: tried giving it another chance. The game crashes randomly 2-3 times a game. Dead."
24156,"It really is as bad with the cheaters as the reviews say. I was skeptical at first, but damn, watching killcams tracking me through walls or shots snapping straight to my head are aggravating.

Would be a great game though."
24157,cant play game unless complete mando training yeah thats going to be a no from me  dawg. UNINSTALL!
24158,This is a great game and there is a lot less hackers now or i haven't ran into any at least! Only thing is i wish chest where cheaper and they were guaranteed to drop a weapon skin! Other than that its really good!
24159,easily one of the funniest/competitive games.  I can literally take any car and drive & kill people at the same time like its gta. poor optimazation is the worst thing about this game.

24168,i paid for it and now its free so i want my money back or to change this to a postive rating yes im that low

Its quite fun now. More players ,faster queues , low amount of bots or even no bots.
Interestingly enough i have not seen any increase of cheaters in my games.

The game is finally going in the right direction! There is no way that they can fuck this up !
Right......??????"

24198,been playing this game since it came out its had its ups and downs but its still fun once you learn it
24199,"There are sooooo many funny moments in this game!

Driving a car with your team and then observing being ran over by some armored truck, after knocking down one of our team members by reverse, two (!) times! We couldn't stop laughing!

Casual shooter on a very big arena. Includes: cars, many different weapons, a bunch of outfits for your character and so much more.

Suggest playing with your own team, will be much more fun, than a solo player with random guys."

24230,good
24231,"Falaram que o jogo se tornaria gratuito, mas isso nao passa de uma mentira, voce so pode jogar o modo casual e 8x8, nao tem acesso ao competitivo e partidas personalizadas. Pra ter acesso ao jogo completo precisa pagar quase 80 reais e nao compensa de jeito nenhum. o jogo esta praticamente morto, e o casual, nas primeiras partidas vc joga contra bots e jogadores iniciantes, mas depois de algumas partidas, voce ainda nivel 10 ~ 45 comeca a jogar contra nivel 300 400 500 e assim vai, muito ruim isso, casual nao tem nivelamento nenhum te colocando em partidas contra jogadores extremamente avancados, e voce nao tem acesso ao comp sem pagar o plus. Nao recomendo comprar o plus e se for jogar o modo gratuito preparece para jogar contra jogadores com 2500horas+ jogadores sendo iniciante."

24318,I would truly say this game arouses me at points
24319,So can we get a refund? I mean like it's kinda unfair you know i spent money on this game. This game used to cool and unique but now you just destroyed it. Soon we wont be able to play the game without someone hacking into it. lmao
24320,"Came for Erangel, got Vietnam and some other snowy map I guess instead.
Free to play is great, but now you have to play the game *our way* in third person on this map in particular or completely random ones.
Can't I just play the map I want to in the perspective I want to?"

24362,"kinda disappointing, i bought it 20$, and now, why free ?"
24363,"this game got free for people who cant afford to buy any game at all, but is there cheaters in the game? id say like, 1-2 per 20 matches you play, so hop on and join the battlefield without cheaters and enjoy the game."
24364,"Cool game, but  developers must solve how keep cheaters away...."
24365,maybe more bots?
24366,"Matches are heavily diluted with bots if you're below level 50 (or playing with below level 50).
Despite regions being a thing 100% of asians play on EU. This causes a disgusting amount of hacking and level 500 tryhards who haven't experienced sunlight in 295 days.
Either ban china or region lock it. China ruins PUBG at the moment with cheating and tryhards.
Still fun (when you're not against a bot or a chinese tryhard)"

24371,"I'm really happy this game doesn't hold your hand and just give you kills by using SBMM to match you against bots. It's an intense survival experience that no other BR i've tried can offer. Well, Fortnite did.. back when they actually cared about appealing to the core playerbase. But now that Epic's fucked the game, this is such a good replacement. I love what little I've played of it so far."

24457,"Bad vibes, depressing aura and atmosphere to this game. All the characters look depressing, even the ones that are meant to be dressed up and fun like clowns and T-Rex dinosaurs. Music selection makes me feel like the game is meant for some kind of zealoted American Militia radical or something. The most positive thing about this game are the dance offs that happen while the countdown is occurring before the actual match. Enough people on this game say some pretty foul things over the microphone for me to include it as a downside. In only a few hours of playing I heard the N-word mentioned, in a short match a clearly disgruntled player cursed out another player for straying from proximity of the team (both were high level) - the angry player chased him down (and I tagged along) until ultimately all our avatars were destroyed by a more cohesive team (the man clearly was not having a good day or possibly not having a good existence), and ultimately I ended up uninstalling the game after realizing: I don't need this kind of mood influence in my life - not even for free."

Grab your friends and just have some fun. Its very rare now than ever that you'll run into a cheater and the content and balancing its so much fun right now. If you were thinking about trying this game and other people are telling you no its s*ht don't try it. Well I recommended you try it first and then agree with them after. Although if you are new I do recommended you play the training course and a few bot matches before playing with real players! Good luck on the Battlegrounds, hope to see you there! Thanks PUBG for re-igniting the love for your BR! (8.5/10!)"

24620,"Welcome to *adjusts glasses* ""Player Unknown Battlegrounds: Battlegrounds"" or simply PUBG: Battlegrounds. A game that has been riddled with bugs, continues to have cheaters, and still has crashes to this very day.

I've been playing this game since those silly memes of ""I'm a snake look at me"" and ""China #1!"". I still remember when this BR had no competition like Fortnite or Apex. Sadly, it's a really bad game still, but I figured I'd try it out again bectit went Free to Play, so I wanted to see if we got any perks as longtime owners or if they changed anything.

No perks, but that didn't entirely bother me, but simply due to no changes. How can a game still be so bad and not address concerns? Hell, Halo MCC had bugs like no tomorrow, but they fixed the shit out of that game.

The worst offender is that I've put 100s of hours into this game, why am I being forced into a tutorial and AI matches? I'd smack the heck out of the guy who made this decision. Heck, I'd even try to be game director to actually get the devs to fix this sorry excuse of a title.

This is a not recommended game to anyone who reads this. It's simply not worth playing."

24763,"Played this game way back in the day, came back to check out what they give me for buying it. Legit enjoying it again. Quit playing due to just getting bored back then and annoyed at bugs that didn't make it unplayable just was sad compared to free to play BR having less issues. A lot of old issues are gone, still kinda iffy performance but hey its free now. Got some cool stuff for buying it way back when. Have had one match stuck on loading, but past that I've enjoyed the past few days and returning. Doubt ill put another 330 hours in but I can give it the up thumb.

Edit
Coming back after an update that made the game unplayable. Last time I played had small issues. Now every game is network lag with 2000 ping and 1 fps every few seconds. Once fixed go back to thumbs up, right this moment don't bother"

The shooting mechanics do not feel good at all, just as I remembered.  I also am getting weird stuttering even on a 3080/5800x rig.  Worst of all is the amount of cheaters I ran into... almost without fail every game that was going well would end in me getting shot in the head from across the map with a red dot.  People wouldn't even be close to on target and I'd be getting shot in the head.  No desire to play with all these cheaters.  The game has so much potential as well, shame."

24838,"Loving this game.... BUT there is a reason why it gets this rating. Being a brand new person, i get put against lvl 500s in every match i play. I cant learn if i'm dead in one damn shot from across the map. There is AI training but you can only do it 10 times and its over and there is casual mode(few humans vs a lot of bots), which is perfect for me, but you are restricted to 3 matches a day. that is BS. I want to buy skins but if i cant play casual mode as much as i want... im not sinking a penny into this. 
As far as people claiming there is a lot of cheaters... i doubt it. i played a few dozen matches and each death was legit. long distance headshot from a lvl over 9000 because all they do is play this game. which is fine, but stop putting new folks against high lvls it honestly makes me want to stop playing since, again, i cant learn when ever encounter is a skilled high lvl and im just lvl 10."

24899,"I've never really had much interest in playing PUBG, until it became free-to-play. My curiosity piqued, I downloaded it to try it out. These five hours are ones I wish I could take back.

PUBG isn't worth playing. For starters, you have to participate in ten matches against bots (or complete a specific list of achievements) in order to play with real people. I really don't understand the point of doing this. Just have the tutorial and let people play.

In my fifth match or so, I was close to winning. There was one bot left to take down. However, when I got out of my vehicle to shoot at it, the ping jumped like crazy, and I ended up being killed. How does a match against [i] bots [/i] have ping issues? That was concerning for what real matches might be like.

Sometimes when I'd land, for thirty seconds or so, building textures wouldn't load. I'd be out in the open waiting for the buildings to load properly so I could actually go in and loot them.

Finally, I beat the ten bot matches and was able to start playing with real people. I only played 3 matches before uninstalling the game. The ping issues continued, to the point where my eyes were hurting because of the lag. The game became completely unenjoyable. Looking through the reviews, I'm not the only one having these issues. And since the developers seem to have no desire to fix anything (at least on PC), I have no desire to keep playing their game.

I wanted to like this game, I really did. Elements like driving made this game fun and stand out from other battle royales. But the issues far outnumber the positive aspects. They might herald themselves as ""the original battle royale"" experience (which they really aren't, they just popularized the genre), but they definitely gave me one of the worst gaming experiences I've had in a while."

24908,"This game is like a hit or miss sometimes, playing duos can be really fun but it can also be VERY VERY frustrating, because this game has been out for 4 years now or something its new players will struggle to really have a good time. I find myself having the most fun when I play duos with my friend and we dont really take the game too serious. the gunfights can actually be very fun and intense and getting kill is so satisfying because of how difficult it can be to get them sometimes. it will probably take most players about 200 hours to actually be able to get a win without playing like a degenerate. 

TIP: if you want to get better either play the arcade tdm mode or land hot everytime in solos youre going to die a lot at first but trust me you will get better.

[Edit] - to address the cheater problem there are cheaters in this game however I would say I have maybe ran into like 5 cheaters out of the 2 or 3 years ive had this game for. there are probably more cheaters in COD Warzone than this game. Even after this game has gone FTP."

Also, Pubg is really good about report ban system, so go ahead and report and if they are truly cheating they will be banned, simple, this isnt warzone, fortnite, or apex, it has realism that takes skill and tons of hours to master.

24947,"Для Русских: Ребят, дерьмо полнейшее. Только в основном Китайцы играют, даже не скачивайте. К чёрту эту игру и её разрабов с их тупыми выборами. 

Let me sum it up in one sentence... Actual burning hot garbage of a game.

Bought the game when it was pay2play, racked up almost 300 hours and had fun with it. Quit in 2019 when the whole hacker problem just started appearing. 
Nowadays, all I hear is: ""Hackers here, hackers there, hackers everywhere."" 
I should also mention that, nowadays you don't even see that many english speaking players. Hell... Even a few Russian friends I found from playing this have all quit, because not only there's a hacker problem, there's also the issue of mostly seeing Chinese players whom just go about on their own."
24948,extremely fun just sweaty AF...sometimes but rly enjoyable with friends. might gain some hackers since its free to play now tho....
24949,i enjoy when chince players sream into my ears after i kill them and i love when someone has the armord car that goes... run run run or u wil die bebrbrrbrbrbrbbr. and so on. play the game if u want ur league of legends adiction to go away. super mega ultra fun ehehuehuehehuehuehehuhueehu
24950,"Battlegrounds is the midwit tier of shooters. Some tactics and thinking will certainly get you into the top 10 for each session, barring some really bad luck, but I can't take any game seriously where the human body can eat rifle rounds and still come out on top.

Still, there's enough here to make it fun if you can't afford the sim gear for DCS or don't have a crew to play Tarkov with. It's especially fun to play in a squad and make some friends, with caveats below. There are also times I really just enjoy sneaking about, outracing the blue ..stuff.. and evading players who are better at drawn out shooty engagements than I. I like the mechanic of describing your ""survivor attributes"" to you; I'm ""decisive"". Generally, I don't want to trade blows - because rifles, dammit - I want to either avoid you or end you quickly. That's how a game with rifles should be IMHO.

The multiplayer aspects of this vary. The bots are just smart enough to challenge you, but the real thrill comes from going up against other players. It's always fun to outwit the other guy or to watch your deathcam and get a good ""I see what you did there!"" moment. Really, unless you're a sore loser, it's often just as fun - or at least informative and educational - to get outwitted by a great player than win one over on a player on your level. Certainly more fun than hosing down newbies.

Coop, however, is my favorite - except when the team, well, isn't. The random matching unless you have guys you play with at a set time means you'll be getting luck-of-the-draw on who you get matched with. Most of the time, they don't have or aren't on comms, which makes teamwork nonexistent; and even if they are, you'll often find a language barrier because global economy, which makes teamwork nonexistent. But if you get lucky and get guys who are talking to each other, not at each other, and working together, it is awesome and really accentuates the game.

Arcade mode is where the midwittery comes out especially strong. It is usually just a run-and-gun time killer; if you're lucky you get a match on a map that offers some tactical options besides the tiresome mechanics of turning up your brightness and running about an unpredictable map in which killing as many of the other team as possible is the sole objective. It is a good place to practice aim and build up the muscle memory for the controls and that's about it. Teamwork is nonexistent despite the default mode here being teams. Avoid unless drunk.

All in all, I give this game my thumbs-up as it remains fun and challenging despite the midwittery of its execution. At least the devs have put in some serious work, and it can be a blast at times. Great way to kill some time while organizing a Tarkov crew or just looking for some escapism while buzzed."

24978,"Best battle royale game in the market now. Feel free to play this game since its free to play now.
Skill ceiling in this game is extremely high, so for new players you have to expect to be bashed by experienced players in the beginning of your plays just like most players did, and eventually you will gain more confidence to play once you master all the game mechanics and map knowledge.
Cheating problem is not really a big deal now, so don't worry and be happy ok.

Its also kind of glitchy and sometimes character moves weird. For example after I jump, on landing it stalls half second, for no reason. Super annoying. Other times I get shot in suspicious ways.

Guns are good, feeling is ok. Sounds very good. 
Graphics... meeh, could have been better. Its ok for mobile gameplay, but for pc is way outdated.
In Arcade I find the map to be always too dark, i dont understand the logic of it. 
Post processing effects are kind of a joke.

Im putting those out as negative traits, because this game is years old and there is no excuse for such small glitches and graphics, given the amount of money they had available.

Overall, its a fun game and a little bit challenging.
My biggest complaint being the graphics and movement glitches."

25115,i really like pubg
25116,amog 👍
25117,veyr fun no KIZZY
25118,"Game is straight Basura, you cant play a legit game without a fkin cheater lookin thru the map and auto aiming, then you cant even report them, you can only report the person that killed you,and you have to wait for all your team members to die to even get the chance to report  the ""person"" that killed you. Its no wonder its full of hackers, PUBG dont give a shit about em , and you can only report one person, their reporting in this game is basura, it seems like they want to keep hackers in the game so they can keep their games player count up and stay on the ""popular"" category, I know im not the only one that feels this way. I have mad skillz but that wont do shit for me in this game, hackers control the battlefield and the game ,and pubg ""Blue Balls"" doesnt give a fuck about the legitimate players, Thats my opinion. 0 stars"

25141,"Is Battlefield 2042 good?
Almost failure to launch. For most, the launch was a pretty rough time for Battlefield 2042 players. It was riddled with bugs and even locked some people out of playing the game due to connection issues. ... While I think a lot of those issues have died down, so has the player count, and it was not a great first impression"

25165,Its a very bad game. Don't recommend unless you're into mobile games like a dunce. Tutorial takes too long and mandatory. Only allowed to play casual mode for 3 matches??? Hella dumb. Don't recommend.
25166,"gud game i guess still would not recommend
"
25167,"Okay okay, I thought the free to play thing would breathe new life into the game. But no, its just a bunch of mobile game bullshit. Like the tutorial that lasts like 4 hours? Wack.

25303,"I've been playing PUBG basically since it came out, and I have many many hours in the game.  For a while, it was great.  My buddies and I were even really good at the game, winning a few matches each time we logged in.  But now, this game has been transformed into the biggest cesspool of cheating, toxic players and removing features.  Every other game I die to ""xX_Swagmaster_Sweat_Xx"" or the like.  And at this point, it isn't a matter of skill.  It's a matter of the developers not caring about the state that their game is in.  I've played well before, but it feels like over the many hundreds of hours I've invested into playing this game, I've only gotten worse.  A manufactured paradox sucking the fun and life right out of this game.  There are multiple maps that you can't even play on, because they're either out of rotation, or because there's not even an option to select a map anymore.  The developers have shown us time and time again that they don't care, either by not working towards a cheating solution or a lack of game improvements.  Actually, at this point in the review, my game just now crashed.  

It's disgusting to see that someone could make a game so fun, and a game that helped bring the battle royale genre to the forefront of gaming, and then make it worse and worse as time goes on.  They don't care if you play.  They want your wallet.  Hundreds of overpriced cosmetics, battle passes, and weapon skin garbage that add NOTHING to the gameplay experience, and yet, I find more each and every time I log in.  If they put even a FRACTION of the time they put into sucking the dollar bills right out of your back pocket into gameplay and fixing the cheating problem, this game would be running as smooth as the developers brains clearly are.  I'm not the only one who's realized this either.  The reviews for PUBG have declined rapidly and sharply.  

The decision to go free to play wasn't made because they want people to have fun.  It was made because people don't want to play a game that's riddled with cheating and bugs and have to pay for it.  By installing this you are making yourself a victim.  Instead of fixing the problem, they'll laugh on a pile of money and give all the previously banned cheaters a ticket right back in.  It's FREE to cheat as many times as you want, as many new accounts as you're willing to make!  The only cost is your time!  If you must play, don't give them any of your money.  That's showing them that they can get away with screwing their community over for as long as they want to do so.  Go to Apex, go to Fortnite even.  If you want a battle royale experience where you even have a chance at winning, this game isn't for you.  I can't even FATHOM what a nightmare this must be for new players, with a steep skill curve ahead them and a rock solid wall of cheaters in their path.  As for me, I plan to keep up with PUBG on the hope that another game I once loved isn't destroyed forever.  But if you're new, don't waste your disk space on this glorified rage simulator.

25385,"Best Battle Royale. 

You can spend time playing the game, checking guides from you tube and forums, you can spend time editing your adventures and publishing them in you tube or a platform of your chosing... and you can spend time and money thinking how to optimize your rig and tactics to best suite your journey to earn the Chicken Dinner.

Been there, done that all. 

I can strongly recommend the game for those who like a bit slower shooters (or hotdropping will increase the pace...) and whom enjoy the ""random"" effects that can happen when facing nearly hundred other gamers chasing the elusive chicken dinner granted only for the winner. 

Every game will be different, and with friends it will have even more random events generated by plans gone awry... or those rare moments when plans are executed perfectly. You can guess which scenario is more probable to happen?

Gameplay wise the experience vary, movement is a bit rough... but the gunplay mechanics are brilliant!  This was the first big BR and after years of playing it's still my main game.  

There are some -guaranteed- annoyances after every patch, or so it feels, but they tend to quickly fix problems. Game itself is quite harsh for overclocked systems... it will quickly reveal any problems you have by quickly and repetitively crashing... untill you fix the problem or agree to safe settings.

There is a bit different feeling when choosing the perspective used: You can either play from third person perspective or first person perspective...  1st person gamelay feeling ""slower"" and being my favourite game type. 

After / due the change to free to play mode, there are now better chances for new players to learn the game: Tutorial missions, training field and TDM... and there might actually be a chance to get in a game with more (other) new players than being thrown straight into the deep end of the pool with hardened veterans... or so I heard from my new-to-the-game RL friends.

Check it out yourself!"

You need to exit and re-enter the game like 2-3 times because after u re-enter it will say network lag error with a perfectly and fast wifi. Game sucks feels like you wasted your money.

25420,"I am a 65 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 23 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

And swamped with hackers using radar cheats and aimbots, who seem totally immune to the so-called anti-cheat system.

Wouldn't take much to overtake Warzone as the new BR leader from this game thru a few updates and improvements. Not too fun when i play by myself but when me and my friends play together i love it. 8/10 would recommend trying a few times before giving your opinion. You also may have to adjust your graphical settings to fix a bit of lag i was getting. After tuning it, it runs really smooth on Ultra and unlimted FPS for me. Happy PUBGing!"

25472,"**update** with another 62 hours since my initial review: still like the game, but have found cheating is more common than originally thought. Have reported quit a few aimbot and wallhack users. What's nice though is you actually see a response when the offender gets his account banned :) a little justice in the world.

As a casual player the game is pretty enjoyable. On TDM I usually make it within the last 4 teams alive, sometimes winning, which as a brand new player is pretty nice for a change, I'll never play competitive, so it's nice that casual actually FEELS casual!
Haven't noticed any cheating, maybe two times where someone shouldn't have known where I was, but that's the extent of it. One killed me, the other guy got killed.
I'd recommend the game so far

It's either only god gamers or i'm complete and utter dogshit all of a sudden. seems like they hand out levels for free since every single one that kills you is lvl 500 with ultra reactions and hitting moving targets from 1 km away with headshots etc. Back in the day i quit because the hackers ruined it. i haven't really seen any hackers now but damn The future Esport scene has a lot of upcoming pros. jeez. And the matchmaing/Ranked is dogshit cant even choose maps or choose how many to play in a group in ranked. terrible.

25726,"Don't get me wrong, PUBG is an awesome game and is truly an enjoyable experience. However, being semi-new to the game (Level 26), and getting killed by a level 500 from 2kms away with a ground loot KAR 16xScope within 10 seconds of landing, is really disheartening. Better matchmaking and reverse boosting checks wouldn't go a miss."

25771,"the most fun i've had with a shooter in YEARS, i really enjoy this game! last fun shooter i played was ace of spades (rest in peace). i agree that the game is a little stagnant now compared to other battle royales, but while pubg didn't start the battle royale trend, it popularized it, and it should be remembered for that. i had stopped playing in 2019 after other games got in the way, and revisited the game in 2021, and i realised how much i missed playing it. ...i also got a chicken dinner my first match back!

too bad the game had its rightful spot STOLEN BY FORTNITE!"

25776,"Very fun to play, especially when having a full squad or playing with the friends, but a very big downside of this game is the presence of the bots, which sometimes represent the half of a full lobby. Also the servers are a bit laggy and the mechanics a bit rusty, but since it is free now, i definitelly recommend u try this"

25791,"this game has the worst servers I've ever seen with ping less than 50 and 0 package loss you'll still likely get server lag (I have good wifi and even people i know with good wifi get the same issues)

gunplay, UI, controls are nice as well as the maps

but they made it free for a reason"
25792,"You have to complete 10 AI training games before you can play with other players which is absurd, many of us have already played on console, instead of playing with my friends I'm mindlessly killing AI. Whoever thought is an absolute retard and should be exterminated."
25793,"BECAME FREE TO PLAY THEN MORE CHEATERS, So sad no wonder this game was dead."
25794,This game is so good and PUBG is always my favourite.
25795,10 A.I Matches before a proper game.. no thanks
25796,"This game was once upon a time actually decent, but suddenly it went F2P and the Anti-cheat failed to do ANYTHING for it. I played two matches recently, I had one instance where I landed first, looted a Medkit and bandages, there was nothing else there, some dude landed right next to me and magically had an AR and killed me, nice game. Next match some dude teleported in front of me and insta downed me, needless to say, Un-installing right now. I hope you either fix your anti-cheat or go bankrupt."
25797,Don't know why i can't load Taego Map
25798,very gut

25802,Gud game thats all
25803,Yes good
25804,so i have to waste my time to play with bots for 10 matches? nope
25805,Machine
25806,"Like the game, alot of tryhards, but its still fun"
25807,"You´ll read a lot about a ""cheater problem"" here.
Are there Cheaters`? Probably
Are there as many cheaters as reviews might suggest? No, I´ve not seen more than 10 in all my hours played (EU Servers) and playing with randoms gave me an understanding why everyone believes the game was full of cheaters.
""Yo, got killed from a cheater, I´ll delete this sh*t game"" - Ran into the open and got shot from a guy 200m away while not wearing a helmet or body armor. In at least 95% of the cases people think they met a cheater, something they cannot comprehend happened... the guy was good, even better than them.
Killcam? Research on how the Unreal Engine replay works and you´ll understand.
Servers are absolutely fine, it´s your connection, leading to 300ms+ pings.

It´s boring because you have to watch you friends play another 15 minutes after you´ve been killed? Go play a game which caters to hot dropping and fast action, PUBG is slower but winning a match is a lot more satifying than in any other game in this genre (at least to me).

Also people leaving bad reviews after more than 1000 hours of playing? Yes, must be really bad! They don´t like the game obviously, otherwise they would´ve put time into it.

Stop complaining about a good game just because people are better than you, your internet is slower than a crippled turtle or you´re playing on a potato.

PUBG is awesome as it is and f2p made it even better."
25808,Best Battle Royale experience out there. Rewards good decision making and at the same time highlights ur mistakes. It has had issues but what game doesnt at this point? True shooter here
25809,very happy that this game finally went free to play
25810,"Bots have killed this game, you get around 10-20 people max and the rest are bots. #RIP PubG"
25811,really fun back to the roots of battle royal
25812,not good
25813,yyes

25829,hooh
25830,dooky game. not even optimized for my thing. runs around 50 fps for both ultra settings and low settings. thank you.
25831,"this game is dead bruh. and for very good reasons. You bl00dy need to play 4 matches with ai to get to play with real players. THen you need to play about 40 matches with 20 real players and 80 bots to be able to play rank matches with (hopefully) full lobby of real players.
all this takes around 20 hours and more. You really thing we want to waste 20 hours playing like a 10yo with nothing to do and go around killing bots. we can always rather go play valorant and get the quick rush of adrenaline we seek. Come on pubg you are the reason for your own demise. Learn from other games."
25832,trash crashes
25833,"The classic Battle Royale experience. While I still run into some modders, it has gotten much better since F2P release. The controls and overall gameplay is smoother than my Xbox PUBG was a few years ago. Same core game, but I wish I could choose to play on the smaller maps. Overall very fun with friends!"
25834,it's a game
25835,"Game is miles above Call of Duty, is actually skill based. Also, no whining children."

25843,it was a good game for its time and arguably it is still a fun game to play.

25849,now it's Free? well can i get my money back?
25850,"A fun game to play! The combat experience is varied and highly dependent on your environment and movement (and maybe your luck too). Although this game is older in the Battle Royale genre, it boasts mechanics few other games have, permanent death for example. And while many prefer a revival system or recoil-less guns, these mechanics serve to provide a more realistic life-or death definition to the genre. And perhaps the biggest boon to the game is it lower skill level. Their are sweats in most competetive games, but so far I have no problem getting a few people. The only complaint I'd have about the game is the abundance of retarded bots just stop and stare, but I suppose they supply situation experience for real-person encounters."
25851,no
25852,hi
25853,"Best battle royal game on steam by FAR, 100% addicting, Always has new updates coming out, 10/10 would recommend"
25854,it's cool...havnt played it much but i paid for it back in the days i remember if i had more time would've played mor enow it's free and better so yeah download it...!!
25855,"This game has always held itself so highly, it never went on sale enough for me to buy, and I'm so glad it never did. This game is trash.

Every control input is delayed, making it feel like my keyboard and mouse are moving through molasses in order to play the game. Is every input being checked by the server as I play? Even against the AI that I can only play against 10 times? Does that number ever reset?

I also couldn't activate cosmetic items from Twitch Prime and other promotions without owning the game, how inviting.

Thankfully, there are much better choices for last-one-standing than Public Unknowns Battlegrounds': Battlegrounds. Just choose from the myriad of other choices, any of them are bound to be more fun than this. I can't believe they bothered with legal pursuits in an attempt to make this heap the flagship of last-one-standing. They should be embarrassed."

25872,its the best BR ever!!!!!!!
25873,"The game needs work. It's a fun enough, grounded game that needs changes. 

Main gripe I'm writing about is matchmaking. Not times or high ping or that, but when I queue for squads, I'd like to actually play with other people. Out of the last 5 matches I've played casually queued for squads 4 have been solo, which simply isn't fun. 

Other than that, it seems to break every third update or so. It's definitely running better than it did on release, but the optimization will only get you so far. Throw in the lack of map choice, lackluster cosmetics, and everything else that slowly adds up, you get frustrated with it.

Honestly I'd probably play more, and the recent ping system is a bright spot. But the problematic matchmaking and lack of map selection keeps this game frustrating in spite of everything it has going for it."
25874,"I need practise in this game, its pretty hard to spray, but game is really interesting :)"
25875,"They convert the game to F2P so that more people can play it. But they don't take into account, that those same people who didn't have money to buy it when it was paid, we don't have a PC to run it at least at 30fps stable. So, it is indispensable to have a ""PERFORMANCE"" or ""LITE"" game mode."

25891,"Despite being a player since 2017 with 300 hours logged, they still require me to play hours of AI only battles before I can play online now that I've reinstalled the game after some time. This is clearly a time-sink designed to discourage cheaters from just making new accounts, but the unfortunate side effect is that it also discourages virtually everyone else from playing the game as well. 

Absolute joke, I wish I could get my $30 back now that it's free-to-cheat."

25899,"Player Unknown's Battlegrounds: Battlegrounds was the first of its kind to achieve commercial success as a standalone game.
Taking the core concept of the ""Battle Royale"" mods for ARMA II & III (somewhat inspired by Minecraft Hunger Games) and creating a fully fledged game out of it was somewhat novel, the fact that it was also fun to play even in early access was impressive!

Unfortunately the developers of this video game have made some unforgivable mistakes which mainly hurt consumers.
My least favourite part was when the developers promised to NEVER include paid gambling mechanics to the game (which they have now). They also decided to never polish or optimize the game to run well on all PC's. Instead they chose to just make more cosmetics which earned them money for a game that (at the time) cost money to even play. Now it has gone free-to-play and has a massive bot problem. Never trust KRAFTON with your money, boycot, boycot, boycot."

25933,"Why no controller support? I know it's possible. I'm aware it sucks compared to M&K but my friends want me to play this torturous game with them on consoles and I can't as far as I can tell.

Anyway, PUBG is your default battle royale. In the year of our lord 2022 it's like playing a chinese bootleg of Warzone. Expect the gold standard Battle Royale gameplay of looting and running in a straight line for 20 minutes only to die to a speck in the distance or be instakilled by a car. Graphics are pretty much the same as they've been; xbox 360-level. Feels like it's trying to have some sort of general art direction but doesn't yet know how to do that.

The guns have nice models and feel ok to fire. The maps are large and detailed with thought-out infrastructure, which keeps every encounter different. The ability to drive cars and bikes is a great way for players to survive the storm, because if you land on the outskirts of these giant maps it's a coin toss as to whether or not you'll have to drive across the map. There's a wide variety of attachments for guns and items, really allowing for a wealth of different play-styles that i'd love to see more development in. I must also add that you can finally see pings in the game world as of recently, a welcome advance in team communication.

The physics, especially car physics, can be janky at times (though they were way worse in the past). Certain movements like vaulting happen at the speed of molasses; don't expect to hop over cover in combat because you'll be vaulting like a drunken idiot for an eternity of 3 seconds, plenty of time for your opponent to mow you down. 

Pros:
- Guns that you can customize both in game with attachments and with skins
- Battle Royale, so it's great for people with gambling addictions
- Detailed maps keep things almost interesting
- Cars
- Huge map

Cons:
- Battle Royale, so get accustomed to losing all the time.
- If you're deaf or can't listen, this game will really suck because you have no way of telling where you've been shot from if you don't see a muzzle flash. Also no minimap pings on enemy gunshots.
- if you have played CoD or Apex you have tasted the forbidden fruit and you will not be satisfied by the gunplay in this. Fortnite players on the other hand will be pleased to know that the telescope on top of your gun can actually be used to make bullets hit your enemies.
- Cars don't like players and are known to kill their passengers at a whim
- Huge Map

I gotta give this game a 2 outta 5. (0 = unplayable/awful, 5 = masterpiece)

If you have the space and a good computer, play Apex or Warzone or Super People for a more nuanced experience."

26060,"I wanted to buy this game in the last year or two but I did not. Why? I read tons of shit about cheaters, toxicity etc. After playing a lot BF5 in the last year or two I was tired playing with cheaters, so, I was like screw this, don't have time for bullshiet. I was so wrong... I downloaded and bought also pubg plus too and I'm having a blast. No cheaters, no toxicity so far. Only as in many other mutliplayer games, there are always players who can't play the game. Very often some ape don't wanna jump in the same place with a team or apes jump into the place with many buildings (towns etc) and they usually die in first 5 min. They are apes and they don't understand that this game is about surviving, not about who got highest score with kills from the first minute of the match. Apes like that are in every game. Also very rare I end up in a team with some ape who kills me. This is a bit annoying, but after teammate killed me, I reported him, 2 days later I got a message that he got banned. GGWP :)

I think it is the best battle royale on the market. All of the complaints about cheaters is just bullshiet. Kids can't play a game and they cry cause they are apes.

I'm having a blast. Soon I will be able to play ranked. Can't wait to play some more competitive matches."

However there a lot of people that seem unnaturally good and quite a few games ruined. 

To be honest it's better to play on PS4."
26172,Not my kind of BR but i would recommend
26173,"compared to mobile version of this game, it feels like PC version is slower and character movement feels slower and heavier. while in mobile, character feels light.
next : Connection. 200 ms does not feels good. i am playing in SEA Region. in other game, high ping only cause like repeated action while in pubg, high ping means well, high everyhing. slower facing left, right, opening door, like everything feels slower and heavier while having high ping.
FPS : i only got like 30 fps. my hardware :
Intel I5 1135g7, intel XE.
Nvidia MX350
8 Gb ram.

overall, not worth it. better play fortnite. why ? better character movement, lower ping, better FPS."

fuck warzone."
26223,"what makes people hate this game?:-

1-unfair matchmaking system ; freshly newbie playing a match after training will face pro player?? wtf with this game,this is truly not a user friendly system.
2-cheating/hacking ; i dont really know cuz i havent meet them but i believe and  watched some videos that theres still many of them as this cheating tool can be download easily and up to date (-.-)
3-IS IT WORTH TO PLAY? ; hmm ..its all up to yourself ..if your becoming HULK after they killed u just avoid it.but its now FREE TO PLAY so why not we just try it ? and dont worry cuz UNINSTALL button are available  Y =_= Y

**game sometimes close itself.so i click UNINSTALL to manually close it forever.

26230,No longer works. Just crashes. Not sure why but it doesn't work anymore. Go play Super People.
26231,"I played this game in the beta. This was the before times, when a pandemic was a really weird movie premise that could never happen in real life. Upon booting up the game currently, I find the game hasn't changed! Except now I have to complete 15 tutorials before I can play the game again. I'm not going to waste an hour to try to play this game again, I played for 42 hours in the beta, there is nothing this tutorial can teach me I wasn't already aware of.

Please put in a way to skip the tutorials."
26232,Cool game. The fights are different than any other BR
26233,A+
26234,people literally sweat this game; not worth if you are a new player.
26235,"First got the game because I watched some YouTubers play it and it looked fun, turned out to be a massive mistake getting it. Tried for 2 hours but the experience was basically the same when I tried CS:GO, it's just full of cheaters/hackers. Literally had a player who didn't even know I was around sneaking behind him snap a full 180 degree and head shot me like it was nothing.

Then I hear it became free to play. I had a hunch, so I tried playing for another hour and was right, it became worse. I want my money back devs, this sorry excuse of a game is absolute trash."

26276,bots are programmed by scratch and they make up 80% of the players in the game wtf is the point of playing ??
26277,gREAT WITH FRIENDS
26278,"I stopped playing about 6 months after the 1.0 release a few years back. During that time I put nearly 1800 hours. The reasons I left then are the reasons I immediately uninstalled after a 3 day weekend where I played a total of 12-ish hours. 

The reason was cheating then and it it's the same reason now. 

I encountered bullet-magnet cheats, aim bot through walls, and the incredible ability for some people to down my entire squad with a single 19 round magazine on a vektor outside of 20 meters. All headshots with ammo left over.

Complaining about it only brings rabbid dogs who, for some reason, defend this game to their dying breath.

The company did implement an anti-cheat sometime between when I quit and when I started playing recently, but have done nothing to prevent chinese players from connecting to US/UK servers. 

Regardless of the fact that Brendon Green (player unknown) himself said that about 90% of hackers come from china, the horrendous ping (upwards of 400ms) that I had to play with made playing against even what seemed to be normal players a chore.

I have not and will not ever recommend this game. If you want the PUBG experience, go play Super People; it's a direct clone with it's own flavor on top."

SEARCHED ON GOOGLE HOW TO FIX CRASHING ON PUBG, I DISABLED MY GPU OVERCLOCK, RESTORED BIOS SETTINGS TO THEIR DEFAULTS FOR THE MOTHERBOARD, REINSTALLED THE GAME, TRIED RUNNING ON ONLY ONE CORE.
MY GPU DRIVER IS THE LATEST, WINDOWS 10 IT'S ON THE LATEST UPDATE.
A GAME THAT DOESN'T EVEN FECKING LET YOU PLAY IT BECAUSE IT CRASHES WITHOUT EVEN SAYING WHY IT'S NOT A GAME, IT'S A MISTAKE. IT'S GOOD THAT IT'S FREE NOW OTHERWISE I WOULD'VE COMMENTED ON THAT TOO BECAUSE A PAID GAME SHOULDN'T CRASH WITHOUT EXPLAINING WHY BUT ALSO THIS GAME IS FECKING YEARS OLD AND STILL HAS CRASHING PROBLEMS.
PC SPECS:
I5-10400
16GB DDR4
GTX 1060 6GB
SO MY SPECS ARE BETTER OR AS GOOD AS RECOMMENDED
I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME IN THE SLIGHTEST BUT IF YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY HAVE A GO BUT IF YOU ENCOUNTER CRASHING JUST DON'T BOTHER WITH IT AND UNINSTALL IT AND LEAVE A BAD REVIEW OTHERWISE YOU'LL BE AS MAD AS ME AFTER FEW HOURS OF TRYING TO FIX THE CRASHING JUST TO PLAY A FECKING MATCH WITH MY FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
EDIT: I EVEN UNISTALLED THE GPU DRIVER WITH DDU THEN INSTALLED IT AND UNINSTALLED THE GAME AGAIN, DELETED EVERYTHING THAT I'VE FOUND ON A SUPPORT PAGE FROM PUBG WEBSITE, INSTALLED IT AGAIN, CHOSE MY VIDEO SETTINGS HOW I WANT THEM(MOSTLY MEDIUM AND SOME ON LOW) AND IT STILL F-ING CRASHES. I DID ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING I COULD AND IT TOOK ME 5 HOURS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND IT STILL CRASHES. THE WORST GAME EVER, AS I SAID BEFORE, A GAME THAT DOESN'T LET YOU PLAY IT ISN'T EVEN A GAME."

26336,"It's a great game but it has its points. I notice that the game has thick desync. More often I get shot and then I jump behind a wall and I still die from the same guy who shot me so that's a point. More often I stand on someone and bullets literally go through him. And I personally find it strange that I have to shoot fewer bullets into someone who is alive, and than someone who is knocked down I have to do more damage. Oh yeah and don't forget the tryharders game is a bit full of fat sweat, and because the game is free, the cheaters are also included for free."

26363,"pros: better than BF 1942 and BF 2 (you can really hide in this game, great graphics and no ""punk"" cheat codes
cons:"

26369,"You cannot choose the map you like, you cannot play competitive solo, only squad matchmaking is possible, overall it feels unbalanced, not worth playing."

26375,"next time make a worse ai retarded idiots. damn you probably can even make cheat clients that aim better as a complete beginner at programming.

by the way nice miscalculations of gun fire. iam supposed to hit the ai at that ACTUALLY SMALL DISTANCE WHY CANT I HIT THIS MOTHERFUCKER WITH A GUN THAT CLEARLY IRL CAN HIT AT THIS DISTANCE BECAUSE I FIRED IT AT THAT RANGE IRL BEFORE.  BUT NOOOO THIS ISNT REALISTIC.

good games are realistic. bad games are arcade shooters. like this one. and the graphics are just a fucking gimmick. 

if you implement a function like a tutorial you should make the ai worse than the player you want to bring near the game mechanics. iam so glad i refunded this last year. as it became f2p i tried again. 

btw... get a conception of aiming with the crosshair and not random bullet spread. this isnt tf2 this is a shooter with weapons based on real life. and damn they are terrible."
26376,Very good.
26377,"I bought this game not long after it came out, during the battle royale craze that was going in back then. I bought it at full price, at least i think i did, it doesn't matter.

I maybe don't have the most amount of hours in this game, not by a long shot, but i bought the game, so what do i get now that it is free to play?

A set of clothes for my charecter, the right to make custom games(which no one plays), me being allowed to que into ranked games, an xp boost, and the biggest kick in the nuts, a grand total of 1300 gold coins or whatever the premium currency is called

This is basically the same thing as the now ""plus"" edition gets you, except that we long time players get an extra set of cosmetics which aren't really that special(the good stuff is in the item shop ofc)

Can't help but feel we got the short end of the stick"

26446,"Owned on xbox, played since it came out. Got released free, playing on PC now. My hours on Xbox was rather lengthly. Anyways. 

Has a certain vibe the other BR's don't have. Yeah, the graphics are a aquired taste, its a older game... but if you're sick of Apex (dunno why), or god forbid Fortnite - people instantly building five star hotels with free wifi - or even Warzone, and savor the simple pleasure of heated exchanges of lead, tactical engagements and the like, give it a try. It just released free, so the player count is high. Not pay to win, just skins. Lots of stat tracking too, like playstyle, KD, etc. Anything a aspiring sweat needs. 10/10."
26447,"Good game i enjoy played the game. It's not a hard game for pc because you can play on a bad pc and make a game look very good. I personally don't like the shooting game in the first person but this game is very cool, and also you can switch from TPP to FPP. Very cool game."
26448,FINALE FREE TO PLAY ^_^
26449,"So we all know about Fortnite. If you would take fortnite and realism and mixed them together in a blender, you get PUBG"
26450,"Played this game 5 years ago and comparing this to now. The game is really solid and a lot of fun. I will be playing a lot more of this game for sure. Going free to play was also a good idea.

I only found two minor issue in game. 
- The parachute feels horrible and slow when flying in. 
- It is to easy to accidentally kill/knock a team mate when trying to pick them up with a vehicle.

Other then that i am having a good time."

Horrible WHEN you use DirectX 12 for the following reasons: Crash on launch, if you are having that problem head to PUBG's properties, and on the Launch options type this: -dx11
this should fix your problem (IF you use DirectX12).
Textures could be better, I use Ultra and it's still not the best.
Overall, pretty good."

I'm concerned that something about the new version of this game causes graphics hardware to fail. I've played this game a TON, and this new version I think has some serious underlying problems in it. Now I'm looking at a $2000 price tag to replace this GPU because of the absurd GPU prices. I'm extremely angry about this"

26715,"I really don't understand why there are so many negative reviews. 

As a ""new"" player (Having played pubg lite +1 year ago), I just played a good amount of matches with a friend that is also new, it was fun, we got close to winning the last one, but got decimated by lvl 500's, which wasn't a surprise considering we can barely hit a shot when facing someone who is at pinpoint range. 

It is free, just give it a try, you might like it. 

Just don't expect to be good, play for the lol's and not for the sweats, it is still a fun game after all.

As for cheaters, I personally haven't seen any yet, but as a cs:go player I can only say one thing: cry about it. You get killed by a cheater? Alright, next game, at least you don't waste 30 minutes of your life playing against him."

I found some cool and chill people by teaming randomly, it's worth trying that.

Also my favorite mechanic in the game is the glider, had a ton of fun hunting them (since they are pretty rare) and flying them / trying to shoot people with the pistol from them :D"

26845,"Well, I hoped one day I would get to review this as a free-to-play game! Now I can, lets get into this.

So firstly, yeah...no regional based matchmaking. Not so good. I wanted to say that first, because it is going to effect a lot of the comments I wish to make in this review. Which as hard as I try, will still sound like I am complaining, but I'm not.

So, I will breakdown the positives. For a Solo player, if you love a challenge and you love being in the thick of it. PUBG is and has always been fantastic. The rush of looting for gear, running out a door under heavy fire through a red zone as bombs go off around you rivals the Campaign in several Call of Duty games. The weapons available are plentiful, as are attachments and character customisation is the best it has ever been, especially if your a legacy player. 

PUBG has came a long way since it's first Beta yet I still find myself a little unhappy with a few things.

Again, you cannot change your matchmaking region, this makes it very difficult to communicate in Squad based game modes for so many of us. Far too frequently you get squads with people who speak a variety of different languages. This in my opinion must change if Squad based game modes are to survive with the current Free-To-Play model. 

Secondly, the store has a lot of in-game purchases for people who want to spend their hard earned, HOWEVER! 
For the currency you earn from your results known as ""BP"" I am still disjointed at the fact through the full store, there are less than 6 items that you can actually buy out-right with this. 

If you wish to spend your hard earned in-game coins, you need to rely on random luck buying item crates, which double in price after each purchase. If you call yourself truly ""Free-To-Play"" please for the love of that Chicken Goddess give us more options to spend our currency! At the minute, PUBG is exactly ""Pay to look good"" because right now new players who are joining have got to be put off by this. Your charging way to much for your cosmetics and not giving new players the options to actually play for free. In my opinion, its more ""run around in a generic white T-Shirt and look at all the rich people"" than it is about actually introducing new players. 

All that aside, it is Batllegrounds. And it is the original Battle Royale experience, it still is and will always be a must have, try it out. It can be great with friends, great Solo. Just don't expect to look good while doing it."

26882,"I've had this game since 2018, I can confidently say it has not aged well.

There are tons of other Battle Royales that are more engaging and fun. PUBG in comparison feels clunky and outdated; from movement, inventory, driving and so on, outside of gameplay, non-verbal communication or Pings are extremely clunky compared to other games. 

From my experience every lobby is 5-65% real players and the rest are really dumb bots. 

If you never played a different popular BR, this might be fun for a while until you discover the other mainstream BRs and this will feel like a outdated game from the 2010's that refuses to evolve or isn't cared for by its developers outside of milking the cash shop."

The game crashes on weaker PCs very often  you can't see any buildings when in the plane about to drop the textures load in when you're already about to hit the ground all the time it's not an issue with your PC, The menus are weird and unintuitive, the game cant decide which button is Z and which is why if you set a hotkey to Y it randomly switches Y to prone and Z to whatever you set to  , there is an unnecessary amount of buttons to crowd the controls and they are never used like leaning because you lean so little you can't even notice it. This games only purpose is to catch horny guys or dumb kids and sell them kinky or edgy skins"

Most annoying is the lvl 500 players, who should actually be lvl 201930, but 500 is the highest level you can get; so if you die it's either because of a lvl 500 or a lvl 3 who got banned before but got another account because the game is free now. BUT, I can still absolutely recommend the game, but I do also recommend to play with friends. I play alone a lot and it's all fun and games but also kinda boring and more importantly depressing lol.

9/10 would recommend"

27149,"This game simply wasn't and isn't good.
It was special in the emerging genre of battle royale, but it was never a good game.

The game still feels and looks like it's in pre-alpha, the UI is nothing to brag about, the controls aren't great, the gameplay itself is poor and lacking, etc.

When I opened up the game for the first time, the ""Terms of service"" page broke and prevented me from playing the game... the very first thing that is shown... Then, after a restart and some luck, I made it to the customisation page just to see that not a single image had loaded, the entire inventories were all blank images that I could select and equip. Not great.

I would recommend any other battle royale over this one, and literally any shooter over it's new deathmatch mode. This is a bottom shelf game not worth your time even if it's free."

27211,very good
27212,ok
27213,I refuse to understand why a game that has this many players is packed to the brim with bots. There is absolutely nothing fun about running around and killing bots that seemingly were written by a 5th grader. All they do is shoot a couple times and then move back and forth. Each lobby is filled with like 80% bots and it strips all of the fun and intensity out of the game. This game was great when winning actually required skill but now its extremely easy to win and takes all of the reward out of it. Sad
27214,is good

I really hate that this game went down the drain because i enjoyed the OG battle royale from its starts here on steam, but now i sadly must walk away with a heavy heart. Goodbye old friend.

27439,"There is no way this game gets a 10. It is super buggy with rampant rubber-banding and desync. There are a lot of cheaters, which Brendan Greene talked about on the H3H3 podcast yesterday. Plus the current ranking system favors super boring camping style.

The entertainment value on Twitch is impressive, and I watch Dr. Disrespect and Viss play daily (RIP Slick Daddy Club for now though...). But the game itself is one map, with no story, and poor graphics, and terrible optimization, with lots of bugs, a good amount of hackers and cheaters - those are not the words that describe a game getting high scores from some sites. They should be ashamed. Sales and cultural impact does not make a game a 9 or 10."

I have been playing for less then a week at the time of this and I absolutely love it. Its realistic but not gory. The gun play is extremely fun and takes skill."
27457,The game is fun at first. Im enjoying playing it. At first i dont know i have good pc to run this game 12 gb ram 1050 gtx i5 proccesor and my game is running only 60-70 fps. You need to fix it the game isnt playable in 70 fps. PUBG do some OPTIMIZATION game.

- It's free-to-play
- Vehicles are pretty fun to mess around with

Cons:
- It's free-to-play
- Clunky controls
- Poor graphics optimization
- Rampant cheating problem
- Sketchy-as-fuck anti-cheat
- Bot-filled servers because ""player retention"" (only thing good about this is that I can finally get a kill or two mid-game before I get my virginity plundered by some level X000 that has been playing since launch)
- Tencent

I really want this game to be good but damn if it hasn't fallen from grace."

27475,hmm

Then APEX came, its even more fun.. fast paced with unique skills rather than basic BR. And now after playing this game since its free. DAMN this game sucks!

Now it’s the same amount of fun and is very well optimized with lots of fun new features, weapons, maps and content. This game is a delightful change of pace from apex, Warzone and fortnite. I absolutely cherish this game and I hope more people try it and continue playing it. This game deserves to stay relevant for years to come. I have been playing a lot since it went free to play and I only came across 1 cheater and GUESS WHAT?!? I reported him and 1 day later I got a message in game saying my report resulted in a cheater being banned! Do yourself a favor, try this game and don’t get frustrated, it takes some getting used too. I recommend third person for new players, it’s easier. Good luck and Have Fun! :)"

How else do you get people to start playing it and get matched against level 500 players in your 4th match at level 4 and AGAIN in your 12th match at lvl 12

How else do you get people to play something where they get to be free cannon fodder for players who have been playing for 5 years

If crashing every game isnt the problem, its the hackers. if it isnt the hackers it's loading into quads solo, if it isnt loading in solo its running from the storm because your game crashed and now youre stuck in the storm, if it isnt running from the storm it's the toxic teammates who killed you while you were crashed and stole all your loot already, if it isnt the toxic teammates it's the glitches still xD textures not loading, sunrays being too bright etc. its fun when it works but man it doesn't work most of the time, wouldnt recommend at all"

27634,"It is 2022, PubG is free...  Why not download it?  Here is why.  The game play is quite terrible compared to modern titles as is the audio.  Could be some of the worst directional audio of any game I have played yet.  The fact that the devs gave up long ago and never bothered to upgrade the game engine, graphics, audio, etc...  just provide crappy skins for purchase means this game really just belongs in the battle royale history books.  Don't waste your time, there are better options now-a-days.  If you want the nostalgia of the very first real BR, then this is it, but I warn you it is infested with sweats, bugs, and hackers...  And is crushingly boring to play solo."

27735,Cool Game
27736,Game is full of Cheaters!
27737,"So far so good, i have been playing this game since release in 2017 off and on and it has come a long way. Things seem very stable now, i had one match where PuBG just closed randomly but maybe that was my fault so i can't blame anyone for that. Also i haven't come across any cheaters/hacks in a couple years so that's a good thing. Since the ""Free To Play"" dropped also no issues so far, if i have to update this review in the future i will. Long story short it's a fun game and takes some time to get in the flow if you aren't use to it. It can be frustrating but that's part of the experience. I like how they offer different modes and more prizes and perks for doing things. All in all it's the OG for the open world style that it is. One thing i wish they would allow is Duo's and squad training together, it would help people who are new to the game to learn from ppl with XP. Other than that i love that came. It's definitely worth the money now for sure haha."

I don't understand why nothing is being done about this. Clearly the anti cheat doesn't work whatsoever.

27762,"Free to play... full with cheaters. Publisher is doing nothing... they only want your money (ingame shop). Nothing else.

Example... enemy team with four players. Everyone has a car. Stop the car... headshot... driving directly to the next player (the complete round).

This game is full with cheater.

This game is dead.
"
27763,"Absolutely stay away. The game is not free. You are limited to only play random maps that some of them are completely awful and you are stuck leaving and searching again if you don’t want to play them. 
The circle is completely random, happens very often the last circle is on top of a hill where you get sniped from anywhere. 
A grenade can kill you in full hp full tier 3 gear. Grenades can be fully timed so you know exactly when to throw them and where are they going to explode. 
Game is lately heavily under attack of cheaters. Hacks are easy to get, there are multiple sites that offer you full wall hack, aim bot for a monthly price and are undetectable. Game is very random, very luck based. If you are looking for competitive skill-based game, this is not it.

27798,"Makes sense why they made this game free for all. Aside the fact that they are forcing you to go through 15 missions to be allowed to play with friends, I never thought there would be a worse game than Warzone. This game right here is UNPLAYABLE. The FPS stutters are insane, it keeps crashing and after the final crash that lead me to uninstall the game, I got a black screen that made me forcefully shut down my computer. And before any cooch juice drinker comments anything negative about my setup, keep in mind, Warzone is one of the heaviest games, if not the heaviest. To think that my computer runs it perfectly fine at high settings, goes to show that PUBG is badly optimised. Making it free won't get you anywhere, you'd have to PAY me to play this game. I can't believe that people were spending money to buy this disaster."
27799,I still like this game but it's not the same as it was when it first came out. Sure there were tons of hackers but there were some features removed that made the game more fun for me since it involved more player interaction outside of ones squad.

Games run smooth and most of the times when people think there are cheaters its just better players.

FREE TO PLAY now this will surprise you doesn't seem to result in shit tons more cheaters but it has made previous sweats even sweater on that lvl 500 grind. But the hit detection is a million times better then apex and its not fortnite. that alone is reason enough in my eyes. Oh and the anti cheat isn't kernal level access looking at you warzone.

27907,"this game is great, the graphics are truly breathtaking, the shadows the realistic muzzle flash again the shadow of your character jumping through windows or even just running. there are so many small things like the training grounds have shooting range with moving targets to practice shooting at moving players. the community is quite toxic if your in solo but if you have some friends its a load of fun"

i dont recomend the game if you like spraying the gun because most of the gun fight is long range and recoil suck if you spray the gun .
i  now i just suck at the game but i play whit height sensitivity and still the recoil is to big to control.

28119,"Before the F2P update, i will admit, this game was absolutely dead, extremely difficult to get into lobbies, whilst 99% of it was bots. Now, while there are still bots, there are far more real players, that is if you are playing with a squad, from what i have found. In solos there are less players, more bots. but if you get a good squad with good comms and ""decent"" aim, you are 85% going to win the game. 

Therefore, If you are a good squad member and like playing with people, and have good communication. then you will love pubg in it's current state, if you are a more of a solo player, then it probably is not for you at the moment unfortunately, with the amount of bots in solos.

28177,"it's just a lot of fun, there are several like it ie: fortnite, apex, etc.  This one just happens to be less cartoon like, more realistic."
28178,"The game sucks. You just start out and you only get 10 AI matches. What??!! That is so dumb. AI matches are fun. Good for practice and lots of Chicken Winners. But... you only get ten. And, you can't even play duo AI matches. Not even duo Casual Matches. The game doesn't even give you free stuff. Also everybody is a hacker.  

So good luck trying to have fun in this game.

Edit: game still garbage do NOT play it you will be extra angry"

28199,"1. Giovanni Georgio is a prohibited username.
2a. Wanted to join a match, but cannot play until training missions are finished. (why is this a requirement?)
2b. Could not complete training because of a glitch. Game would not recognize the fact that successfully shot target while aiming down the sites. Could not progress.
2c. Unable to play game because unable to complete training. 
3. Could not get a refund, because this is a Free to Play game.

What a royal waste of time."
28200,"if you decided to get this game you could not have made a more terrible decision in your life. This game is the best way to rapidly decline your mental health with how disturbingly terrible every aspect of this game is. I swear on my life a group of neanderthals developed this game. My life is forever tainted after experiencing this vile and wretched game. Every breathing aching second is agony thriving in pain after you choose to open the game through steam and just know this, Fentynal withdrawal feels like heaven compared to this. please for the love of the lord and all that is holy please save yourself a lifetime of regret and dispair and dont download this game."

( I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus)
28204,"unplayeble bc of stutters that occurs randomly and pretty frequently. I have no idea why, but no solution found for now. This is for the developer to figure it out ffs.

28255,"First time I met with PUBG was about three years ago. I was playing on console and having lots of fun. Last year (2021) I heard something about it coming free so I took my time and was checking on it once in a while. I didnt BUY this game really because of these ""Cheater"" comments. Ive only played for about 29 hours and let me tell you. I have NOT seen any cheater yet. If there would be so much cheaters as reviews say, Id run upon a cheater every game. Im new to it only on pc, (like I said previously, Ive played this game for hundreds of hours on ps4) but the game is just a masterpiece, some people say its too slow for them - go play DayZ, this will show you what is slow. You can choose your own way to play, aggressive or passive. Either land in Bootcamp and get slayed calling them cheaters or go land in some sort of houses on the shore. I absolutely LOVE this game and will play it as I used to. I am very happy with developers making it free. Of course, Its a bit limited and of course, there ARE going to be more cheaters since the game is free but its absolutely worth your time. All you need is your couple or even one friend that you can play with. Its fun alone, but much better with friends. Whenever I get tired of this game I still come back to it in a week because Its just so satisfying to win and kill other players. I recommend. Anyway, where we dropping?"
28256,"You are seriously about training at first launch this game, when before i`ve got more than 10 hours on lite version, and also i can`t walkthrough this training match because his not work(("

28278,"I got hooked up on this game tbh. Was playing with the bois and we tked ourselves for fun and now I got banned for killing PREMADE LOBBY teammates ONCE. Also you can get PERMAbanned for afking and playing abnormal( which is hilarious). Devs are completly fucked. If you don t believe me check pubg tos. I was going to buy battlegrounds + for rankeds, but now I know it s waste of money. Don t try to have fun or else you will get banned."

28280,"For the love of God allow map selection in normal mode.
Just allow it.
You know, literally everyone wants it.
Why in Gods name did you take this feature away, i remember being on xbox and it was perfectly fine, until you made to many maps and you ripped the choice from players so you'd feel justified in making said maps.
Why is there a ""Random"" map button, when thats literally our only choice
Please just bite the bullet, give-us-the-option"
28281,HGCJ
28282,shit game
28283,"yes but there is a steep learning curve, having friends helps"
28284,"I am not sure what to say about it. 

You HAVE to do a tutorial, which would be fine, IF the tutorial did not require so much.

You must play 10 TEN!!! games against bots OR complete some missions, which can be harder to do than the 10 rounds. 

I would suggest you play something else. 
"
28285,The game is somewhat better now that it's F2P. Somehow less hackers. Performance is a bit better. And less bots. We'll see if playerbase can stay up
28286,Its mindless fun with a bit of thinking. Try doing challenges with your friends like? Win a game without killing anyone. Pistols only. Hand-grenade  madness Mondays. Thank me later.

28534,gud game.
28535,"if you want 15 mins for the game to open, 20 minutes of sitting in a random bush/house doing fuck all, and being one shot from somewhere no one would ever be able to see, definitely play this game.
"
28536,"verzzzzzzzzzzz niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeez
"
28537,"People in the reviews complain about cheaters while I have not seen any yet, I will say that there have been more than a few cases where the people I killed acted like they dont know how to shoot, which leads me to believe there may be more bots than we think.
the game itself is great!"
28538,I'm loving the game so far. I've only played for 28 hours currently but I'm hooked on the game right now. I'm happy about the changes they made because I used to play this game on Xbox but now I'm on PC. I would 100% recommend playing it though and trying it out because It's free. Also I did buy the battlegrounds plus pass.

28552,the worst matchmaking I've ever seen in any video game
28553,"Honestly after the game went free to play ive been having the most fun i ever had playing it. I play in SA servers and cheaters are non existent, however there is alot of bots. On the upside, you do get into matches instantly. 

Some things i wish they improved tho is the optimization. When i first got this game in 2018 it ran great on max/high settings at 1080p/1440p. Now i barely get 60fps on low. I have the same pc and everything. Also, add more arcade gamemodes."

great with friends where you can talk about the meanings of life while fighting for boosts. play solo only if you are on therapy and taking your meds daily.
arcade deathmatch is great, but i am afraid of breaking my peripheral devices from rage."

28700,Came back to it recently to try it with mates.  Game feels like a buggy mess with sound issues constantly. Queue's are instant and lobbies just filled with bots making the game boring.

98% of the players you encounter are P***ys 
theres no time to react... you get shot by some P***y hiding and camping
theres literally no time to be put into action.. you walk out ur building and u die 
u move u die 
Every corner of a house u enter has jiz all over it
to all you people who play like this... ur moms a H** :) 

Other than that i dont have a problem with this game theres sum about that i find satisfying. feels real and enjoyable if you face actual good players who want some action as much as you do. I rather die in a long back and forth battle exchanging blows than to some fkn p***y camping waiting for you to walk out your building or enter it. 

Imma leave a positive review cuz the game and the developers arent bad 
just the people who play it are"

28731,"i paid for this game years ago, and now that it's free me and some friends decided to see if maybe they updated the game mechanics or the graphics, and no.
instead, we each have to play 10 AI battle royale games. 10 to 30 minutes each.
the game remembers my account, i'm a ""plus member"" or whatever. i still have coins in my account.
this game plays like it was made in the 90s and looks worse than some ps2 games. this is garbage and i don't support it.
the only joy i get from pubg is knowing that the developers arent getting paid anymore."

28765,its massive
28766,"I wouldn't recommend if you're honestly looking for a competitive game to play - yes it is fun for casual and you can have fun with your friends, it runs smoothly and are few bugs to ruin your experience.

However, you only have the ability to play squads in the 'ranked' game-mode which overall brings this game down and really stops it being at the top of it's potential for battle royales - it is sad I enjoy this game and want to focus on it competitively but the game-modes just stop you."

28778,Chicken for dinner is all you need
28779,Good game. Had a lot of fun playing it with friends. Can be challenging but that's with any battle royal game. Overall good thoughts
28780,"So yeah, games free, fun and not pay to win why not try it?

Its F2P now, and like most new players alway was interested but didn't want to pay the buy in for a game that had bugs as ppl said. Honestly the games fun, really fun for f2p and is definitely not pay to win so thats nice. I will say the game feels dated in some aspects, the drop animation and parachutes feel so clunky compared to apex or cod. The gunplay is fun and dont feel like any gun is way over powered personally. Downsides are no crossplay. Havent come into any hackers so the dyehard playerbase just has a hard on that they had to pay ig? Im sure they are out there but COD has 3 in every warzone match vs almost 0 or if any 1 in these matches. Add me you fools i need friends"

28792,crashes now and then but great game
28793, .
28794,Dude you are playing against bots. So many bots. You cant even change a map. Its free now so what ever but with bots this will die way faster. Jesus christ.

28797,"I purchased PUBG years ago and it slowly turned into a MOD fest. You would start, loot, and within 5 minutes be getting aim bot sniped from clear across the map.

Ever since it became free to play I decided to give it a try again and i dont know wtf is going on but its amazing. 30hrs later and I have not once come across blatant modding or scripting. I have played against some pretty sus people but not so sus that I never had a chance.

Also. Im in LA, CA playing casual and only waiting anywhere from 1-30 sec to get in a game. Thats amazing compared to how it use to be. Usually its like 10 sec Q. 

Also, Im getting crazy low run ins with BOTs! Like I said, IDK WTF is going on."

28809,"The most dog sh it combination of battle royale and combat realism, gameplay feels clunky and gunplay is trash, the recoil on guns is actually unplayable. You land on a location and try to find at least some kind of weapon for about 3 min and then micromanage your inventory and gear for another 10 min, then camp out on the final teams and die from behind. After five years of this game being out its still the most boring ""battle royale"" out."
28810,Bad
28811,so fun

28813,"I can't believe how bad this game have become, PUBG should've remove the K/D ratio since it's free and cheaters are manipulating the game like Singapore servers there are too many Cheaters and who doesn't know that most Asian country doesn't require ID to buy same card and they can just buy card every time they got banned, just like Philippines how much the Sim Card cost? only Php10.00 $.20 dollar.

The Updates 17.2 what makes me feel more sick of this games is that Grenade Timer, PUBG should have just Announced that They're redesigning PUBG as Games for the noobs seriously?!!"

28864,BEST BR GAME <3
28865,"'Been playing this game a lot Solo, Duo and Full Squad back in the days when it came out. Thought I'd give it another try after hearing it went F2P. 

Well turns out the first person I encountered (after having to do a boring a*s tutorial against bots for around 1 hour despite already being familiar with the game) onetapped me with a shotgun from the hip at around 50ish meters. Deathcam was cleary showing aimsnapping so I am just assuming the use of an aimbot there.

Ik that (more) cheating is not an inevitable consequence of going F2P. But that first impression just screamed for me to ALT + F4 and delete the game again. Sadge."
28866,"good game, free now"

28870,No bugs in this game!
28871,yes very much
28872,Because this game have terrible Servers and i can't change servers without a vpn service.
28873,"There isn't really a medium rating on steam I am only giving this a thumbs up because it isn't bad, that said though it isn't great either just an ok game.
Firstly there is no level or xp difference in a match so you get placed with players at level 1 and level 400+ when you first start which is unfair as new players don't know how to play or what the meta and gameplay style it is. I don't know if ranked is like that or not as I don't have access to it yet but restrictions between newer and older players should be added.
The recoil with rifles in this game is the harshest I've seen out of any shooter game but that's ok because every game is different so I can accept it. However because of that I stick to smgs and snipers where I don't have to worry about it as much."

Normal games even at evenings are 60% bots maybe even more, it is a waste of time thats truth. Good concept for 2017 but the game is money grab for its owners and left unfinished unpolished.

the hit detection sucks, its optimized horribly, there's no reason to use anything but the rifles and sometimes 20 minutes of gameplay will just go down the drain because you failed spot the single moving pixel in the distance that was a sniper or you had the gall to walk into a house that another player's camping in and get instantly shreded because of how low the time to kill is.
But for some reason i still have a ton of fun playing this game 
and now that its free there's no real reason not to get it especially if you have some friends to play it with."

Doors or fences can break from where you shoot at it, you can aim left or right, graphics look awesome and back then I didn´t had a gaming PC and when I heard Its going to be free I was so exited but what I didn´t know is game is downgraded. Now graphics looks like shit, doors and fences still can break but worse, You can still aim left or right because its a mechanic. BUT worst thing is fucking traning mod. IF you wanna play online you need to play with AI for 10 matches and every match takes minimum 25 minutes. I was thougth pubg mobile and lite is bad THIS FUCKING GAME IS WORSE THAN PUBG MOBILE. now I hate pubg mobile and its community but at least it has better graphics."

"
29184,kinda gei ngl.
29185,"during the beta:
- a lot of crashes and bugs
- every players are equal
- no long ass loading screen
- can have fun with friends

after the release:
- loading screen takes forever and usually stuck
- cosmetic, virtual currency are the main source if you want to buy anything, the money received after a match is garbage and can only be used to buy random crates (and only some crates can be open easily, while the others required a key which you have to spend your real money to open)
- hackers are too many and obvious
- game performance, server issues still have not been fixed yet, game still runs like shit, the graphic still looks blurry and pixelated

the game is free but im rather spend my money on other games that are more stable and fun

29251,Just another hack FPS.  Nothing special here. Another game I used to love to play ruined by individuals that don't have natural skill so they need to fake it till they make it.  Plus the game makers don't help when they don't really show you where you're being shot from or who killed you. How are you supposed to report someone for cheating when you can't even see if they were cheating when they killed you. LoL ! Ridiculous.. Glad I didn't buy this. Makes it a lot easier to erase it.

29282,"1️⃣. The Industrial Revolution 🏭 and its consequences have been a disaster 💣 for the human race. They have greatly increased ⬆️ the life-expectancy 🙏 of those of us who live in “advanced”. countries🇺🇸🇬🇧🇫🇷🇩🇪, but they have destabilized society🌋, have made life unfulfilling 😭, have subjected human beings to indignities 🙈, have led to widespread psychological suffering❗️🧠❗️(in the Third World 🇸🇳🇵🇸🇸🇴🇿🇼 to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world 🔥🌳🔥. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation 📞➡️📱➡️⌚️➡️❓. It will certainly subject human beings 👨‍💼👩‍💻👩‍🎓🕵️‍♂️👨‍🏫👨‍🎨👰 to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world 🌲😢🌳, it will probably lead to greater social disruption 😱 and psychological suffering 🧠⛏️, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries 🇸🇬🇨🇦 🇪🇸🇸🇪.

2️⃣. The industrial-technological system may survive 🍃 or it may break down 🍂. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low ⬇️ level of physical 💪 and psychological 🧠 suffering, but only after passing through a long 🕐🕑🕒🕒🕓🕔🕕🕖🕗🕘🕙🕚🕛🕜🕝🕞🕟🕠🕡🕢🕣🕤🕥🕦🕧and very painful 🤕 period of adjustment and only at the cost 💰 of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms 👨👩‍🦰🐼🦁🐷🐸🐱 to engineered 👷‍♂️👷‍♀️ products and mere cogs ⚙️ in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable 💯: There is no way of reforming 💭 or modifying ❗️ the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy🔓.

3️⃣. If the system breaks 💔 down the consequences will still be very painful 🤕. But the bigger 💪 the system grows ⬆️ the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner 🔜 rather than later 🔚.

4️⃣. We therefore advocate a revolution ✊against the industrial system 🏭. This revolution may or may not make use of violence 🔫; it may be sudden 💥 or it may be a relatively gradual process 📈spanning a few decades. We can’t predict 🔮 any of that. But we do outline 🔲 in a very general way the measures 📏 that those who hate the industrial system 🏗 should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution ✊ against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL 🏛revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the ecoqnomic 💰 and technological 💻 basis of the present society.

5️⃣. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative 👎 developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological 🏗📱 system. Other such developments we mention only briefly ⏱or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant 🚫. For practical reasons we have to confine ⛓️ our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something 🆕 to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental ♻️ and wilderness 🌱🌳🍃movements, we have written 📝 very little about environmental degradation 📉or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important ❗️."

It not only has the battle royale aspect, but you loot as well. Kinda reminds me of Escape From Tarkov mixed with Warzone LUL. Game is way better balanced. I always see people complaining about hackers and yet you're going to get that in any game, especially Warzone. But honestly i haven't ran into any yet playing PubG, that i know of LUL. Anyway i highly reccomend this game if you are anything like me, I play a game that i like until i get good at it, and there is a point i get bored with playing the same game. So PubG going free while i can feel myself get bored of Warzone was perfect timing. Now i can take a break from it and play this game which is a pretty cool game!"

29394,"If you are looking for a fun Battle Royale experience, this is not the game for you. PubG is best described as fortnite if you took away everything fun about it. The game is uninspired, unoriginal, and tedious. More than half the players in any given match are going to be half programmed bots that are as likely to die from glitching out than in an actual fire fight.

Beyond that, PubG is so greedy they make literally every other Battle Royale game look honest. Somehow they have managed to turn almost every interaction with the server into a micro-transaction. Most egregiously they will force you to pay $10 to change your username. Ten dollars to change a single line of code on a server. Who do they think they are, Microsoft? It's unbelievable. 

What's more unbelievable is that this isn't a new behavior. The game just went Free-To-Play. You used to have to spend money to get this experience.

Fortnite may steal from other games, but at least they don't try and steal from their own players. Play literally any other Battle Royale before you play this garbage."

If it is a good game, why do they need to make it f2p? The only reason I can think of is that the game is not making more money. Or in other words, f2p makes more money. Thank you for reminding me for posting this review and how bad this game is by making it f2p.

It used to be a leading game in 17 I have to admit. But after playing nearly 300 hours, it is at least not improving. A lot more survival games are better than this with better optimization and fewer modders."

Been playing for almost 4 years and yes the game has died down to the point where most of my kills are bots running around but this game has still brought me memories when I was 13 getting carried by a quad group of middle aged retired military men with kids screaming in the background.  To be honest I prefer the old men who use their real life combat tactics in a video game rather than little 12 year olds on fortnite.  The game is fun and honestly is not unbalanced, guns do the damage they should and a player takes the damage they should.  Overall this FPS/TPS is a classic battle royal and I will forever love it."

29451,i mean is till cant find the bind so i can build and am struggling to find minis and big pots but other than that a good game

29484,a
29485,i sorry
29486,After playing for an hour as of review I can safely say this game is terrible. Me and some of my friends can't even log in except for one time. That said one time we couldn't even play the game together because you have to play a tutorial that is un skip able. We tried to play the tutorial and had several crashes that reset our progress. I regret even putting this into my library. After becoming one of the top 15 selling games ever and charging $60 you'd think that they would be able to handle the slightest influx of players. Do not and I repeat DO NOT touch this game.
29487,I like to LMG's and the guns at long range.
29488,WHY WOULD YOU TAKE OUT OTHER MODES AND ONLY ALLOW ME TO PLAY CASUAL 3 TIMES A DAY? I BOUGHT THIS BACK ON PS4 FOR FULL PRICE AND NOW HALF THE GAME HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM ME
29489,"My favorite game on mobile, glad that its now free for PC! I'm so glad this game is being picked up again, by new and veteran players."

Edit: tried to load in and ""Servers are in maintenance"" Yippe, i will never get to play this game as long as i live Thank you Playerunknown Battlegrounds: Battlegrounds :D

29575,Its fun
29576,"There was a time where PUBG content were flooding my facebook feed because of its popularity, bringing a unique style  of shooting game by pitting 100 players against each other. I never had the opportunity to buy it because I lack the funds to do so. Instead,  I went and play  PUBGM (after years since the game was out)  to at least try my hands  on the said  game  despite being so late to play it. Once I got my very  own PC I  had  this  on my wishlist and was readying to buy it this January. Fortunately, it became  Free to Play so thank you for that! As expected, the  experience  is amazing despite having  difficulty to compete to some of the  veterans in this game. But  what's a little bit of challenge to improve yourself, right? Overall, because of this migration  to F2P,  PUBG has once again made noise."

29603,pubg is a great game to play with friends a lot better than Warzone
29604,"THIS GAME IS SO MID ITS UNBEARABLE

the graphics are fine and the guns handle great but you can't ignore how boring it is

90% of players are BOTS that just walk back and forth and the players you see happen at the very end

the map is uncomfortably large so you have to run/drive a kilometer to get into a fight, and most of the time it's just two braindead bot squads shooting at eachother so you feel nothing from killing them"

It just insane how copy games as Super People, runs better than PUBG.
Confusing menus, extreme annoying training -- why do I MUST play 10 games of that? Why can't I just choose to play a game with my friends against other people??

Large map with nothing in it. It is a running simulator to maybe get some action on the end. 
When you criticize CoD remember, that there is much worst games as PUBG"

I am so sorry if you were gullible enough to pay for this game, as I wouldn't even be able to look at myself in the mirror anymore if that was the case for me. If you like getting molested by hackers, glitches and terrible game design, then you would absolutely love this game being your weird uncle. In conclusion, please do not play this game if you value having enough brain cells to perform everyday tasks, please don't play this game. I'm gonna mutilate myself now."
29657,"This is very unpleasant game, I hate it, I hate it from my deepest spot in soul but I play it.
This game is so good that stun granade flashes you tru the wall, your GUN STICKS OUT FROM THE WALL LIKE SOME MAGIC SHIT AND EVERYBODY SEE WHERE YOU ARE. Im glad that this is now free so people wont throw theyre money anymore. Its hones review but you know what, I W I L L  S T I L L  P L A Y  IT."

Hell, there's even a Kill Cam feature where you can watch how you got killed, and developers said they're implementing a Kernel-level Anti-Cheat that also can HWID-Ban cheaters, the game is actually fun if you don't go out running with no gear and no cover

The only con of this game is the fact that spraying is unnecessarily difficult. Even in Arma 3 or Escape From Tarkov, spraying is easier in those games than in PUBG. Besides, it's a decent F2P game. Definitely much better than it's rivals considering this became free"

It's really heavy to run, the menu is glitchy and all over the place, there's constant crashing, sometimes you cant load into games so you have to force close it etc etc etc...

They also remove Training matches after 10 attempts for whatever reason. Dumb decision.

For a free to play experience now, it's worth giving a shot, but I'm not happy about the performance of the game, crashing issues, game and menu design problems, and some features which are seriously not polished.

Good game, bad state at the moment. It's hard to even play because half of the time it will crash"
29755,"the audio is TERRIBLE! you cant even hear an enemy stomping around just outside or even in your building. the game play is very slow, even for a battle royale, you are basically just running around for 10-15 minutes just to get picked off by some random sniper or some guy who you can't hear seeking up on you with a shotgun. i agree with the people that say this is the first battle royale because of how bad it is. don't even consider this game, if you want a battle royale on steam just play Apex Legends for free."
29756,nice game and finally free!

29782,"I've developed rage induced suicidal tendencies because of this game but nonetheless a fantastic game, excluding the mf cheaters..."
29783,"Unfortunately, the complete truth! Steam has destroyed the game play by switching the game to free. 
Hackers have completely destroyed and ruined this amazing game.
The most saddest thing is that Steam refuses his head and washes his hands of all this and the situation is essentially alarming. This beautifull game unfortunately is no longer playable from original players - gamers with real skills. The in my opinion the 90% in this game is all hakers , cheaters and scammers."
29784,"Crashes every 30 mins. Thanks to ""great"" developers whose hands grew from their ass!"

29789,"this game is so slow paced i want to die, the graphics are so bad and the recoil on guns i so retarded. i play this shitty game just so i can run over my friends with a motor bike, and its sad that is the best part of the game. no wonder its free now because no one with a stable mind would buy this game."

29792,"after 2 days of playing my computer started getting these freezes, like 30 seconds freeze every 20 minutes or so. even after removing the game. it all started from lags in game (which i hadnt at the first day i played they started in the 2nd day). now i have to reinstall my windows. thanks guys :)"
29793,oyunda karı yok beyenmedim
29794,pubg mobile better
29795,While it is a fun idea for a game it runs out of depth and diversity really quickly and you find yourself doing the same thing on the same map with the same limited combat layout choices. Also what is left of the online community doesn't seem very friendly towards new players.
29796,haxz
29797,goog gaem
29798,"F2P didin't help, Game still piece of shit."
